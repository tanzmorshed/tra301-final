","12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime – film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.<br/><br/>Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism. <br/><br/>Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.<br/><br/>Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet. <br/><br/>There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools. <br/><br/>To watch 12 Years a Slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. To say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial, as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like Gone With the Wind or silly exploitation from something like Django Unchained. Both of which serve to make the topic digestible. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. It's a film of such ugliness, such blunt emotional trauma, that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. So why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? Because, it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time."

","chitchens fan  2 hours ago △ ▽ <br/><br/>− <br/><br/>Well, to begin, I cannot remember the last time I could not get up at the end of a movie. I literally could not rise up from my seat. My body felt as though it were being weighed down by something considerably larger and heavier than myself... History had it's way with me( I am an African American woman). Thank you Mr. McQueen, Mr. Ejiofor, Ms. Nyong'o, Ms. Paulson and others, and yes, even Mr. Fassbender. I am not a film critic nor a movie hobbyist, although I try to stay current, but what I am is a human being trying to understand the various problems and issues within our country. This movie is a potent reminder of why we are where we are as a society today. How man can be so unflinchingly cruel to his fellow man, especially if he looks, speaks or behaves differently, I will never understand."

","A random and encounter has led Solomon Northup from living freely in New York to being kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, getting handed over to various slave owners. There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.<br/><br/>As I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Butler"". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.<br/><br/>Central to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.<br/><br/>A fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.<br/><br/>I was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now."
"LetwitJr","10","226","356","9 September 2013"," Another masterpiece from McQueen
","I attended the premiere of 12 Years a Slave at the Toronto International Film Festival. Having no tickets, we had to wait close to 4 hours hoping they might let us in. I have to say it was definitely worth the wait and it is hands down the best film I've seen at the festival. <br/><br/>The film is based on the real story of Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man living in New York, who is abducted and sold into slavery in Louisiana. As the film begins, we are exposed to his talent as a musician (he plays the violin) and get a glimpse of the life he leads with his wife and two children. All is well until he meets two men who seem taken by his music and want to bring him along with them so he can play at various events. When Solomon wakes up in chains, his dark journey starts and the film never lets you take a break.<br/><br/>If you've seen McQueen's other works then you more or less know what kind of movie to expect (if you haven't then please stop reading and watch Hunger and Shame). 12 Years a Slave is dark and raw, it exposes everything, without sugarcoating it. It is definitely hard to watch; Several people walked out of the the theatre but in my opinion, it is not only worth watching but necessary. Films exploring themes of slavery are few and far in between and never has one been quite as exhaustive and effective as this one. Beautifully shot and edited, the film features moments of tension, heartbreak and a few laughs here and there. Steve McQueen has created another masterpiece.<br/><br/>Most actors get very little screen time. Paul Giamatti and Sarah Paulson are seen for a few minutes but both are great as usual. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a plantation owner, who recognizes Solomon's talent and tries to help him to a certain extent. Despite being a slaver, he is presented in the film as being a good man. Cumberbatch was very good, though outshined by far by Michael Fassbender. He goes through every emotion and gives it his everything. In my opinion, this is his best performance to date. Paul Dano gets a few minutes of screen time as well but makes incredible use of it. As Benedict's worker, he despises slaves and the songs he sings to Solomon makes an incredibly powerful scene, one of the most disturbing in the film. Lupita Nyong'o's first appearance in a feature film is stunning, as she plays a heart breaking young slave. I hope she has a long career ahead of her, she certainly has the talent for it. The true star is definitely Chiwetel Ejiofor. His performance as Solomon is stunning and unforgettable, I truly hope he wins the Oscar for it this year.<br/><br/>All in all, if you get a chance to see 12 Years a Slave, don't miss it. Not everyone will be able to stomach it but it's an outstanding film that deserves and needs to be seen."

","Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)<br/><br/>One of the things that have been thrown around for months now is the notion that awards season voting bodies won't respond to it because it's too ""difficult"" to sit through. Let's define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I'd argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of ""too difficult"" around.<br/><br/>I've watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I've seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass' ""United 93"", which is almost an emotional biopic of America's darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, ""it's too hard watch."" Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone's ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can't answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn't just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.<br/><br/>Now when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.<br/><br/>I have long admired the talent that's been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I've known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.<br/><br/>As Edwin Epps, Solomon's last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the ""Amon Goeth"" of our tale, he is exactly what you'd expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He's vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.<br/><br/>Mark my words; Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful ""Patsey"" at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You're watching the birth of a star.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP's in the business. Especially following his work in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.<br/><br/>Oscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar's in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There's also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven't seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this ""difficult"" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there's no reason it can't top the night. I'm very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in ""12 Years a Slave?"" I remain hopeful."
"peibeck","6","268","457","14 November 2013"," Acting cannot save a soulless ""Slave""
","Director Steve McQueen has gathered a talented cast, a compelling plot idea, and a wonderful cinematographer and then snuffed the life from them with his clinical, detached directing style that robs what should be the most affecting movie of the year and turns it into a plodding, emotionless, historical biopic.<br/><br/>Despite the valiant efforts of Chiwetel Ejiofor and especially newcomer Lupta Nyong'o, this drama about a musician who is duped, drugged and sold into slavery never manages to find an emotional chord.<br/><br/>Like last year's Oscar-bait, ""Les Miserables,"" the film is often told in long, steady pan shots or a continuous array of distracting close-ups of actors filled with angst or anger. And the film finds no rhythm in its editing to make these extremes work. Even the most harrowing scenes in ""12 Years,"" and there a plenty of them to choose from, lack dramatic tension. One may as well be watching an accident filmed on a surveillance camera on the local news, because that's how detached McQueen's film style is (which also killed his over-praised ""Shame,"" for me as well.)<br/><br/>Some have likened ""12 Years a Slave"" to ""Schindler's List,"" but for emotional wallop, there is no comparison. ""Schindler's List"" is in every way, from script to score, the vastly superior movie: not only shocking but truly emotional and with actual drama.<br/><br/>John Ridley's screenplay has a few fine dynamics, but quite frankly in the end all the characters in the film end up being (literally) too black or white. Even the few characters (like Benedict Cumberbatch's Ford or Garrett Dillahunt's Armsby) who seem to have shades of gray, of course turn out to be turn-coats. Michael Fassbender and Sarah Paulson get two roles that feature them being evil incarnate, to the point you expect Fassbender to twirl his mustache at times. But again, any kind of shading the actors may have tried to play gets lost with McQueen's endless habit of sticking the camera repeatedly into the actor's faces.<br/><br/>""12 Years"" is by no means an awful movie, but I think hype surrounding it in the press will lead to disappointment in movie goers who are expecting an amazing visceral tale, and are deceived into getting a stagnant and clinical examination of some of the darkest days of American history. Members of the audience I saw the movie with began talking half-way through and some people were overheard saying, ""How can they make this subject so dull?"" as they headed for the exit."
"hal9341","10","143","239","18 October 2013"," Astonishing and heartbreaking
","I just saw this at LFF. It is a brilliant piece of cinema. Clearly it's central theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easily reach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about wider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It is violent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story of Solomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about the way Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it so astonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, not because the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heart strings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer. This really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough to understand it."
"tigerfish50","9","148","259","22 September 2013"," Abducted to a Southern hell
","Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana, which is backed up by legal records.<br/><br/>The story begins with him living with wife and children in upstate New York as a free man and respected member of his community. After being lured to Washington by a couple of con-artists who promised him work, he was subsequently drugged, locked in chains, viciously beaten, stripped of his identity and shipped to New Orleans to be sold into slavery. Over the next twelve years, he was owned by two men who treated him in contrasting ways. The first was a relatively civilized fellow, but the plantation's half-witted manager was threatened by Northup's superior intelligence. Their mutual dislike produced a dangerously volatile situation, and unwilling to lose his investment, Northup's owner re-sold him to a neighbor. This unbalanced individual regarded his slaves as property to be used for pleasure and profit, which caused them to live in perpetual fear that his capricious moods would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment.<br/><br/>It's noteworthy that a British director has become one of the few filmmakers to delve deeply into this subject, and the combination of John Ridley's powerful script and McQueen's directorial skills has inspired exceptional performances from the entire cast. Their dramatization of Northup's experiences is both riveting and uncomfortable to watch, as the film depicts the perverse nature of a society that permitted such a barbaric system. Hopefully it will reach a large US audience, who will learn how a privileged Southern elite cruelly exploited their fellow humans in order to acquire greater wealth for themselves."
"iamchrisallan","4","103","179","19 January 2014"," Didn't engage me.
","12 Years A Slave is nominated for all the awards and talked about with huge praise. Well sorry, but having just seen it, I have to disagree. It's 2hrs 13mins of hardship.<br/><br/>We have seen powerful films in the past that have dealt with injustice and suffering, films like Schindler's List, The Color Purple, The Killing Fields etc., but all these have managed to get across the horror and suffering whilst keeping me engaged. Unfortunately, 12 Years was just suffering.<br/><br/>I felt the film really dragged. Much has been written about how Steve McQueen is very brave to hold shots for a long time. The film is littered with shots that linger for an age while little or nothing happens and I say that if you notice that a shot is long then it's too long and doesn't work. Surely if this was a good thing you wouldn't notice it. I noticed it, and noticed it and noticed it.<br/><br/>I was so pleased when Brad Pitt showed up, not just because he is always good to watch but his role is that of a saviour and believe me, at that point the film needed a saviour. He has a line that sums up the film ""Yours is an amazing story but not one point of it is good"".<br/><br/>The final scene really killed it for me. This man has been away 12 years and when he meets his family does he run crying into their arms? No. Does he whoop, laugh and shout with joy? No. He sadly stands and meekly asks their forgiveness for his shabby appearance. Arghhhhh! <br/><br/>I cry at movies. I am an embarrassment as I cry that easily. Guess what? Not a tear. For a movie that deals with the horror of slavery that's a terrible thing."
"Ajtlawyer","2","144","257","24 November 2013"," 2 hours of sadism
","I was hoping to really enjoy ""12 Years a Slave"" but wasn't expecting a 2 hr long movie of very long, ponderous slow camera shots of nature and hardly any compelling dialog or character development. This was then broken up seemingly every 10 minutes by a savage flogging or a vicious rape or some other sadistic cruelty being inflicted on the movie's hero, the hapless Solomon a freeman sold into slavery, and the other slaves. Except for Brad Pitt's Canadian abolitionist and a gentleman from Solomon's home town, virtually every white character in this movie is portrayed as the very embodiment of evil. No nuance, nothing but unremitting sadism.<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to be comparing this movie to ""Schindler's List"" although I can't understand why. In ""List"" you had the compelling story of Schindler who, for reasons known only to himself, risks his life to save as many Jews as he can. The Jewish prisoners are depicted as full characters, people you know and care about. Even the Nazi played by Ralph Finnes is given some depth, a man whose cruelty has been unleashed and sanctioned by his Nazi bosses but, you suspect but for the war would be a man who might be interesting to be around---a lover of fine food, good wine and a roving eye for the women. But the slave masters in ""12 Years a Slave"" don't have the slightest hint of anything human about them, just treating people with cruelty for cruelty's sake.<br/><br/>If filmmakers really wanted to make a powerful movie about slavery, they might consider boldly making a new version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and hew closely to the story that Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote. It's a powerful book and it gets far deeper into the immorality of slavery than anything like ""12 Years a Slave"" does. The memoirs that ""12"" was based on came out soon after the huge success of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". The opening scene of the slave-traders benignly discussing their ""wares"" in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was so chilling to read that I couldn't even bear to read it through in one sitting. ""12"" had a similar scene with the excellent Paul Giamatti as a slave-trader, but the movie never got any deeper."
"nellie-english","1","290","536","23 January 2014"," 12 Years Asleep
","Once again Hollywood waves its sanctimonious wand over history with this glossy movie about slavery in the United States. Like a self-righteous teetotaler telling off an alcoholic, it is a sentimental, holier-than-thou piece that challenges you to criticize it or 'you're a racist too'. Following in the footsteps of Django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence. The film begins in the home of the central character, Solomon Northop, a free black man, who lives a genteel life with his family in New York. The director is clearly eager to get to the gory bits though, and within the first ten minutes Solomon has been kidnapped, enslaved, and the audience is cringing under a close up of his contorted face during a twenty minute whipping scene; the first of many to come. <br/><br/>The film continues in this vein, as we follow Solomon's journey through an array of increasingly evil slave-owners. There is a segregation of personality in the film, with most of the black characters being good and moral and the white ones evil. Surely it is as patronizing and insulting to assume personality is dependent on colour as it is politically correct. At least the same cannot be said of gender, the white women are as evil as their male counterparts. However no film about slavery is complete without our token good white guy, and Brad Pitts rises to the occasion, strolling in bearded and ready to play, once again, the hero.<br/><br/>One does wonder why Solomon doesn't send a letter under his 'mistress'name on one of his frequent forays to the shop. (Of course, his one attempt to run away is thwarted when after two steps he stumbles on a lynching scene). Perhaps the point the director is trying to make is that Solomon is too broken and scared to do this. He is too proud, however, to pick the cotton quota demanded by the sadistic slave-owner. A necessary contradiction perhaps, as this allows more whipping scenes as he is punished daily.<br/><br/>Or why, instead of trying and failing to write a letter with a blunt bamboo stick and watery juice, he doesn't simply use the candle end and stain the paper instead. But it is not a film for the details. Nor the historical overview.<br/><br/>It is two hours of increasing brutality, culminating with a horrendous scene where one girl is whipped until her flesh is exposed. Instead of taking one of the many examples of modern day slavery however, which could leave people feeling guilty at inaction, it is set far enough in the past that it allows the audience to do their cinema time, and leave feeling as worthy and sanctimonious as the director."

","Solomon Northup suffered many degradations after being unlawfully forced into slavery in the American Deep South during the 1840s and 50s. He contributed to a ghost written book detailing his tragic experiences. This movie is based on that book.<br/><br/>The film is relentless in its depiction of the despicable white men and women that Soloman (renamed Platt Hamilton by his new 'owners') encounters as a slave. There is absolutely no let up. This does a disservice to Mr Northup's account of his tale. By his own account, William Ford was a decent man, though a product of the time he lived in, and his background. He was not portrayed as such in the movie - I'm guessing because this did not fit the screenwriter/directors literal black and white vision of his tribulations. Thelma and Louise suffered from the same type of problem, in it's depiction of 'all men are bastards' proclamation.<br/><br/>I got bored after a half hour or so. Which should not have happened. It's a terrible story, filled with deeply tragic events. But I found myself, moving from... Jeez, that's terrible. The poor man.....to Oh God love her. That's unforgivable.... to I am so glad I was not born black in America during slavery... to OK, I get it. There weren't many sympathetic white people... to Sheesh, was EVERY white person SO irredeemably vicious? to Alright, ALREADY...I get it..White people treated black people worse than animals!! to Oh FFS, how was this written? With crayons? I also found myself thinking of Alex Haley's Roots. This told a not dissimilar story of enforced slavery on black people in America. But there was dark and light in the story. You rooted for the characters. You understood that the black slaves were quite often better people, all round, than their white owners. But you weren't beaten over the head with that thought.<br/><br/>12 Years's depiction of Salomon and his companions existence did not let up for one second. I don't mean to underplay the hardships that they endured, which were terrible. But the relentless depiction of all of the black people as nothing other than victims reduced them to caricature.<br/><br/>Just like a good horror movie will have light moments, which both relieve the tension and then make the horror more shocking, it would, for me, have been better served to show moments of light relief which were then snatched away by, for example, the loathsome Edwin Epps. In this way, we can better identify with Salomon's plight. But the incessant misery becomes almost expected after numerous representations, to the point where it ceases to shock. And that's what's wrong with the movie, for me. Something has gone seriously wrong when the depiction of merciless hardships by fellow human beings becomes boring. And I was bored. Not helped by too many lingering closeups, some extending to thirty seconds. The director is obviously a fan of Kurosowa.<br/><br/>The actors were all excellent, especially the lead character. It looked beautiful. And I will read the book now, where before I hadn't heard of it. But the movie didn't work for me. A good story badly told."

","12 Years a Slave — a biopic about a black fiddler in NY who somehow wound up a slave in Louisiana from 1841 until the law rescued him in 1853—is the nearly universally acclaimed front runner for the Best Picture Oscar. Yet it's built upon a fourth-rate screenplay that might have embarrassed Horatio Alger.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is hailed by critics as a long-awaited breakthrough that finally dares to mention the subject of slavery after decades of the entertainment industry being controlled by the South.<br/><br/>The message behind the ongoing enshrinement of the rather amateurish 12 Years a Slave is that the cultural whippings of white folk for the sins of their long dead ancestors will stubbornly continue on until morale improves. The formula: Stoke it, package it, market it.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen directs the film in a sort of minor league Passion of the Christ manner. Some of the appeal to critics is that Northern whites are shown as saints of racial sensitivity in the film's preposterous first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave opens in 1841 with Northup being effusively admired by his white neighbors in Saratoga, NY. Northup is a model of ridiculous bourgeois respectability, always doffing his top hat to his white peers while out riding with his family in an elegant carriage.<br/><br/>How could he afford that? Well, actually, he didn't and couldn't. A glance at Northup's ghostwritten 1853 memoir makes clear that in 1841, rather than being a pillar of this Yankee community, he was an unemployed fiddler dragged down by his own ""shiftlessness.""<br/><br/>In McQueen's often baffling movie, this respectable family man suddenly decides to run off to join the circus with two fast-talking white men without even leaving a note for his wife. Later, while dining in an elegant Washington, DC restaurant with his new friends, he suddenly takes ill and wakes up in chains.<br/><br/>Ironically, his poor family never reported or even guessed that he'd been kidnapped. They apparently assumed that vanishing was just the kind of thing he'd do.<br/><br/>When word of his kidnapping finally arrived home in 1853, top officials in both NY and Louisiana were dismayed by the trick played upon this freeborn citizen and worked together to quickly have him released.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it was widely believed that Northup had conspired with his white cronies to defraud slave owners of their purchase price by attempting to pull a con on them. Reminiscent of the 1971 comedy Skin Game, starring James Garner and Louis Gossett, Jr. as traveling grifters in 1858 where Garner repeatedly sells Gossett into slavery and then helps him escape.<br/><br/>Northup's hometown newspaper, the Saratoga Press, surmised that Northup had been an accomplice in a scam gone awry:<br/><br/>""it is more than suspected that Northup was an accomplice in the sale, calculating to slip away and share the spoils, but that the purchaser was too sharp for him, and instead of getting the cash, he got something else.""<br/><br/>This theory that Northup was a man of dubious character rather than the tediously upright one depicted in the movie might explain another puzzling aspect of his tale: how little help he got from his fellow slaves. In general, the other slaves as display remarkably little human warmth toward Northup. They mostly act completely indifferent whenever he is around.<br/><br/>When Northup finally arrived home, an abolitionist politician hired David Wilson to be his ghostwriter. Wilson wrote Northup's story in his own style, and they hit it big in the slave-narrative craze that followed the 1852 publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Not many were sold, but more than enough to launch Northup on the abolitionist lecture circuit.<br/><br/>Predictably, Northup disappeared from history four years later. Those who knew him best seem to have assumed that he had become a ""worthless vagabond,"" as his wife's obituary bluntly phrased it. Almost all of this is left out of the movie as being far too interesting for Oscar Bait.<br/><br/>I suppose Third-rate Victorian literature such as Wilson's version of Northup's memoir is tolerable today if the author understands his limitations. Most of the first-person narration is thankfully utilitarian. Only occasionally does Wilson have Northup reminisce in the grand Victorian manner: ""Now had I approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.""<br/><br/>Indeed, on the rare occasions when Wilson quotes Northup's utterances, the slave speaks in a more plausible fashion, such as, ""There is nobody I want to write to, 'cause I ain't got no friends living as I know of.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Ridley's adaptation takes its inspiration for its made-up dialog from the worst prose in the book. Since it would be racist for Ridley to show slaves ending their sentences with prepositions, they instead orate pompous speeches toward each other, like Prime Minister Gladstone addressing Queen Victoria. As the hero, Ejiofor labors to bring life to these lines, with indifferent, if not comical success.<br/><br/>Hollywood has been waving its celluloid wand over history since its inception. Unfortunately, studio contrived ""reality"" usually wins the emotional battle over the truth --even for those with more than a tenuous understanding of the world around them. It's all part of the ongoing, and successful campaign keep all critical theory groups in their respective consensus trances; instilling grievance focused identities in blacks, and derivative guilt syndrome in whites. I suppose once all the altruistic white people who fall for sympathetic pleas of universal equality have been eliminated via natural selection, blacks will spontaneously adopt their innate, but perpetually oppressed Western sensibilities and go on to build flourishing, first world Utopias? <br/><br/>Coming soon to a theater near you!"
"parallel_projection","9","36","59","3 November 2013"," A disturbing but powerful portrayal of slavery in America
","Directed by Steve McQueen and staring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict CUmberbatch, newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, and a ton of other stars, '12 Years a Slave' is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a freeman who was living in Saratoga, NY before being tricked, drugged, and sold into slavery in the south.<br/><br/>McQueen is an auteur known for his honest and brutal direction, and he keeps filming when others would shut the camera off or look away. While making the picture that much more difficult to sit through, his steadfastness greatly elevates the emotional impact of the film. It's a must-see, if only for educational purposes—just as 'Schindler's List' is used to teach about the Holocaust and 'Milk' about the struggle for gay rights. <br/><br/>I'm not trying to compare the events depicted in this film with the events depicted in those I just mentioned, all I'm saying is that they are all equally important in portraying the reality of their respective situations. There is a moment in '12 Years a Slave' when, as a form of punishment, Northup is hanged by his neck, the tips of his toes just able to reach the ground below him. The camera stays on him for a few minutes. It is silent, and all you can do is listen to him struggling for breath. <br/><br/>This is one of the more disturbing moments in the film, but not the worst. Eventually, Northup is sold to Edwin Epps, a short-tempered and impulsive plantation owner portrayed by Michael Fassbender. He is by far the most villainous and terrifying character in the film, and Fassbender brilliantly captures his mood swings and tempestuous personality. <br/><br/>It is Chiwetel Ejiofor, however, who steals the show. He brings so much life to Northup, and completely disappears into his characters. He is able to depict so many deep levels of emotion, while also bringing dignity to a man who was unwilling to let anyone take away his will to ""live"" rather than just ""survive."" Additionally, Lupita Nyong'o, in her first big film role, is mesmerizing as Patsey, and hardworking and desperate woman, and the object of her master Epps's attention. She is hated by Epps's wife—masterfully played by Sarah Paulson— and most of the more dramatic moments in the film revolve around her character's tragic story. <br/><br/>If I have one complaint, it's that 12 years do not seem to pass by at all, mainly because none of the characters substantially age. Also, Brad Pitt is thrown in for ten minutes to depict a kind-hearted abolitionist, and while he does a good job, it just feels like Brad Pitt on a slave plantation, which is totally out of place. <br/><br/>Regardless, while the film may be harrowing and difficult to sit through, it is simply brilliant all the way through, and by far the most honest depiction of slavery that I've ever seen."

","Where to begin? OK, by stating the simple facts. <br/><br/>The history here is distorted beyond all measure. 21st century sensibilities, seen through the lens of sterilized political correctness, make this film practically unwatchable from beginning to the (oh will it ever come?) end. Every white character is a one dimensional pastiche of evil while, conversely, it's only black people who possess anything approaching morality and basic human decency. It wears out and wears thin very rapidly indeed.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen - a director whose previous work I admired - got this film all wrong. He needed to do many things to put this film on the right track from the get go. But, most of all, he needed to work with a script which had its roots in reality, not in this distorted, oddly perverse and, frankly, unworthy representation of antebellum America. It's a shame and a sham yet it could have been a great story. Truly awful, but I gave it 2 stars - the extra one because, thank heavens, Oprah is not in it."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","9","39","66","24 February 2014"," 12 Years A Slave earns the right to be called one of the best films of the year.
","If any contemporary director deserves to be in the mainstream spotlight without compromising their style, it's Steve McQueen. His debut, Hunger, already had the hand of a confident filmmaker taking a fly-on-the-wall style to the grimy art-house. Shame was one of the finest films of its year for its impeccable depiction of an addiction to one of humanity's primal survival instincts resulting in self-destruction. I'm so happy that his latest film has gracefully conquered early Oscar favourites from the output of David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and the now delayed film from George Clooney to become this year's Oscar frontrunner. During its festival run when the buzz first began, I took it upon myself to read the screenplay. While I can usually sink scripts within a few hours, the poetic density of 12 Years A Slave took several sittings across a week or two. Even on the page it was a harrowing, exhausting experience. It's a film that needs a have a gut to truly display the length of time, but the script is bloated in its brilliance.<br/><br/>Naturally, scenes were cut (whether in the editing room or pre-production I don't know) and that's a blessing and a curse. Now in the film, we rush to Solomon Northup's capture, opening with scenes we shall revisit later on. I understand the decision to enter the world as quickly as possible, but I do feel it hurts its first act. As much as I jump for joy every time Scoot McNairy hides himself in a film, the transition from ordinary life to becoming kidnapped feels jarring and contrived. Who is Solomon Northup as a free man? What does he want? Maybe we don't know because there is no source for the matter. Maybe McQueen isn't interested in telling that story. At the very least, we definitely know that Solomon is a compelling character during his capture. Chiwetel Ejiofor is an actor I've always liked but he's never made an impression until now. His passion and commitment to his portrayal of Solomon is utterly captivating. While he can slink into the background of some scenes where he is not the focus, when it's time to shine he bursts a fuse.<br/><br/>Unfortunately during this cluttered first act, it concerns itself too much with subplots that we know will not succeed. While they accomplish establishing the stakes at hand and rule out the 'why doesn't Solomon just' there's just too many abridged tales. Perhaps this is distracting just because I know the full stories from the script, but they should've went all or nothing with them. It results in editing that frustratingly refuses to let us into Solomon's headspace. We're along for the ride, but too frequently not Solomon's ride. During then we only get rare and rewarding glimpses into how he feels and his perspective on his past life stolen from him. Fortunately the film vastly improves once Solomon is free from the deliciously cruel Paul Giamatti to the spiteful live-wire Paul Dano. As the film focuses on his one-on-one conflicts and moral dilemmas, the film reaches intimate and truly challenging moments which is where the film's power lies. Fruitless subplots are dropped in favour of heartbreaking ones as we're introduced to the pitiful Patsey on the pathetic Edwin Epps' plantation.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender and Steve McQueen have been one of the most enthralling director/actor combination in recent years. They always bring out the best in each other. Here, it feels like they've reached their finest work yet, but still feels like their collaboration has just began. Fassbender's Edwin Epps is the film's most fascinating and complex character, a man who sincerely refuses to believe he is evil. He demonstrates the thesis of the film in that the authoritative caucasians didn't believe they were doing anything wrong. Many people have laid claim that he is pure evil, but I don't think that's the point, he belongs in a misguided world where he thinks his lust and affection is apt praise for Patsey's talent. While I may not have sympathy for him, he is a tortured soul, a regrettable and irreversible tragedy of mankind and this is thanks to Fassbender's incredible performance. His victim Patsey, played by talented newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, is an utter revelation. She may not have a fully developed character but in at least two powerful scenes, she makes the best out of what she can for a character that warrants the tears you will inevitably shed.<br/><br/>One of the most consistent aspects of McQueen's films is the magnificent taste in cinematography and production design. Presumably from his art background, he's great at immersing you into his bleak visual worlds. Working with Sean Bobbit again, the cinematography is reliably enchanting. In true McQueen style, if a character must endure patiently, in this case Solomon hanging from a noose on the tips of his toes, we must endure with them. No shot this year, not even in the extraordinary Gravity, has been as stunning and unforgettable as the infamous long take of Patsey's lashes. It's a filmmaking masterclass in just a few short minutes. Despite the shaky first half hour, it's all redeemed in its harrowing final 15 minutes. It's the greatest sequence I've seen in a long time and I've never had a scene make me a blubbering mess quite like it. Yes, the jump to his kidnapping feels abrupt and there's no sense of relief to his inevitable freedom, but this is all calculated to mirror the struggle of his experience and we've felt every beat. 12 Years A Slave is a powerful testament to the endurance of the human spirit with its theme of injustice applicable to any point in history that earns the right to be one of the best of the year. After a string of lightweight Best Picture choices from the Academy, this will be a refreshing choice. <br/><br/>9/10"

","I'm really going to be the exception here and pan this film. I was no non-plussed about it that I can barely be bothered to review it properly. The amount of dead space (for example a 75 second scene showing Soloman just looking at the scenery) was astonishing - any other director would have dealt with the subject matter in about 30 minutes. Both my girlfriend and I were close to walking out with the boredom.<br/><br/>But we didn't because we were expecting the stage to be set for a finale whereby through complex legal machinations, the injustice is uncovered and Soloman is reunited with his family. So what complex genius might effect his release? He writes a letter to a friend! A LETTER! Genius - amazed he could devise such a complex solution given a mere 12 years! So once reunited, will we be treated to the legal wranglings to ensure this can't happen again and that those responsible are brought to justice? Nope.<br/><br/>So, basically, man gets kidnapped, lives as a slave working for three different ""Masters"", witnesses hard work and unfair treatment of slaves including murder and rape, and eventually gets to go home after writing a letter to a friend who comes and picks him up. Hardly noteworthy at all, and in my worst five films of all time."

","One of our partners was invited to TIFF for the premiere of Life of Crime so I was lucky to be able to tag along with him and watch these two great films along with The Lunchbox. I didn't initially even think of writing a review because I would hate to discuss something that the majority of the public hasn't seen yet because public opinion would be limited. But, seeing the reviews that some have published has pushed me to write a review of my own.<br/><br/>In the beginning, the movie moves semi fast as far as getting into the central plot but not too fast that you don't get the opportunity to assess the characters. In fact, by the time Solomon (Ejiofor) is sold into slavery, in my opinion, his demeanor, education, and his family are established enough for you to invest enough emotion into him that by the end of the film you care enough about him to wonder if he and his family will ever be reunited.<br/><br/>I don't understand how someone can say that they were bored because they are desensitized by the beatings and tortures that African American slaves endured during that dark time. Odd analogy but, I cried at the end the movie Titanic not because I was unaware of the fact that the ship would sink and eventually be the demise of thousands of people but because the story telling grasped my attention and pulled at my heart strings. Same case with 12 Years. Yes, you know Solomon along with the other unfortunate souls will endure physical and emotional pain and you might be well familiar with the tools and methods they accomplished this with but it makes it no less shocking, sad, or important. I wonder if this person saw the same movie that I saw, if at all, because without spoiling too much of the movie, there is a torture scene in which the camera not only zooms into what's occurring but it also seems to last forever to the point where I was so uncomfortable that I wanted the scene to end. McQueen does this throughout this film (along with many of his other films), his scenes make you uncomfortable mostly because his camera lingers on scenes that are very hard to watch.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the only time I got teary eyed was in a funeral scene where Ejiofor's acting shines and mostly with facial expressions (and some singing) you realize that he's finally succumbed to his situation versus how in the beginning he emotionally fought his sudden twist of fate. As far as the other actors, much has been said about Fassbander and Nyong'o's superior acting, rightly so, but I found myself being really impressed with Benedict Cumberbatch and Paul Dano's performances. Hopefully, we can all agree that Fassbander's character, Edwin Epps, is that of a tyrant and just an awful human being. Someone like that is easy to assess but Cumberbatch's William Ford is more complex. He's a slave owner yet he treats his slaves humanely, to an extent he cares about them but he definitely puts his and his families' interest above all, and although he doesn't partake in the beatings he sure doesn't interfere with the process. He makes you ask yourself if neutral people like him are good or bad for progress. I still don't know the answer to that. Paul Dano plays John Tibeats and his character is cruel and has horrible mood swings. The way he was played, I wondered if the person the character was based on had a mental disorder. He's uneducated (almost slow), not even respected within his peers, and overall just a loser. Not to make excuses for him but how could someone with those defects possibly be kind to another human being let alone a human who was considered inferior throughout that time. He too makes me question the hardships that other people, other than slaves, were going through during that time.<br/><br/>Overall, this film had a great narrative, strong performances from the entire cast, and I would definitely recommend this film. I do have two complaints, though. I too felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. In all fairness, I'm not sure what kind of closure I was expecting but I felt like much was left unsaid. My biggest gripe of all has to be the torture scene I mentioned above in which Patsey (Nyong'o) yells something to Solomon and it just had John Ridley's over the top style written all over it. According to Solomon Northup's biography this exchange did not happen so why did Ridley feel the need to add such a dramatic statement? What was the need to create sexual(?) tension between Patsey and Solomon's character? The same could be said about a speech Solomon gives in the film. That too was fiction and not realistic but I guess they did that to emphasize on their message on hope."

","Let me start off by saying that I like a good movie based on a true story like Schindler's List, The Butler, A Beautiful Mind, We Bought A Zoo, etc., etc. I'm also fully aware that not all events will be entirely factual so when I went into this movie I wasn't going in expecting accuracy in any form. What I did go in expecting was a good performance by great actors and I must say the acting was fantastic, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a complete train wreck. I felt it had potential at first and then that feeling quickly dissipated after watching the first beating commence and continued to diminish after seeing the attempted hanging where he walked around on his toes for at least a good twenty to thirty seconds and we had to sit and watch. I didn't think it was possible for the movie to get more boring but then they threw in yet another thirty second scene where we all proceeded to stare at the main character's face while he sat idle, occasionally moving his head from side to side. I wanted to feel emotion for these poor characters but every emotion that I had was quickly ruined by incredibly long, drawn out, and unnecessary scenes. Not only did I have to sit through the agonizing, stretched out scenes but whenever there was about to be a significant lapse of time within the main character's life they'd add in a bonus five to seven seconds where we stared at a bunch of trees. I'd like to say that I was moved by the movie or felt some sort of enjoyment in watching it but in truth the only touching moment I truly had was at the end of the film when I realized it was FINALLY over. I'd liken it's boringness to The Fifth Estate but honestly it was far worse. My advice to you would be to ignore the plethora of ten star reviews and think twice before you decide to pick it up for movie rental once it finally comes out on DVD."
"gsygsy","10","34","57","12 January 2014"," As high as cinema can go
","It's rare that a movie lives up to its hype, even rarer that the hype is transcended by the actual achievement. 12 YEARS A SLAVE does both. Aided by powerful performances and cinematography, director McQueen exposes the barbarity of dehumanisation, of treating people as property. Reviews focus on the brutality on display, and it's true that the film is not easy to watch, with its powerful juxtaposition of sublime scenery and human degradation. But to me the final scene is the most powerful of all: we are party to the kind of raw emotion that in the hands of lesser artists could easily descend into tawdriness or sentimentality. Here, as in the rest of the film, it is raised up high, as high as cinematic art can go."

I don't know if Steve McQueen or someone else screwed with it so much that it no longer worked, but someone murdered this script.<br/><br/>Characters appear and disappear for no reason. Plot lines are thrown in, rolled around and pulled out. Then there is the miracle ending that's not foreshadowed in any way - a total Hail Mary - like the producers suddenly said: 'Yo, Stevie, you're sitting at over 2 hours... End the thing already before we run out of cash.' Ugh... Never have God (or his human counterpart, Brad Pitt) save your movie in the last 10 minutes.

"carladoolin","2","43","75","7 February 2014"," Why Do We Watch Movies?
","Why Do We Watch Movies?<br/><br/>We watch movies to be entertained, to be educated, to be moved.<br/><br/>My husband and I recently went to see ""12 Years a Slave"". It was, quite bluntly, dreadful. <br/><br/>The movie was based on the personal accounting of Solomon Northup, a free black man, who in 1841 was abducted and sold into slavery. I did not read his book, but judging by what I have read, the movie did not follow the book very loyally. What a shame. I think I will read it now, if only to redeem a story so deserving to be told.<br/><br/>I do not profess to be a producer, a director, an actor, or a cinematographer. I do not presume to state how this film could have been better. I just want to tell you why I did not like what could have been one of the best movies of all time. I am a middle-aged, white, Canadian woman, and it is a testament to our society that I actually have to qualify that. I am so grateful to not have lived in an age of slavery. No man has the right to enslave another, and to have lived in an era where one race habitually and acceptably treated another as less than human would have been excruciatingly abhorrent to me. Slavery is wrong. Slavery is evil.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that many aspects of slavery in the 1840's were accurately depicted in this film, and it truly had all the elements of a classic, with a compellingly profound story and phenomenal actors. However, the direction was horrendous, the screen writing decimating. The protracted, paralyzingly boring close-ups and shots of gazing at trees were not evocative or artful, but only served to sap the life from the story for me. Added to that, the excessively prolonged moments of having to watch Solomon tap-dancing at the end of a noose, and the constant, brutal whipping scenes made my feelings of pity and disgust and rage almost dulled to the horror. <br/><br/>The cinematography could have been so much better. Settings are characters unto themselves in movies, and instead of bringing to life a Louisiana in the 1840's, I was treated to long minutes of Spanish moss waving in the breeze. It was dull and lack-luster, and added nothing to the film.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one (zero not being an option here) is because of the memorable performance of some of the actors.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor's depiction of Solomon was excellent, considering what he was given to work with. The screenwriter's stripping treatment of who Solomon really was was very unfortunate. From what I understand, he was intelligent and resourceful, used his ingenuity to enhance the lives of his fellow slaves, and was actually forced to be a slave-driver himself for a portion of his enslavement. Including this in the screenplay might have given his character much more dimension, and shown me a man who I could actually root for, instead of just pity immensely.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o was extraordinary as the young slave, Patsey, and is an actress to be watched for in future.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender is always brilliant, even in crappy movies. This performance was no exception. He was evil incarnate, and made me suspect that Master Epps very likely had syphilis, so crazed and bizarre was he portrayed.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti does sleaze so well, and here he did not disappoint.<br/><br/>It must be noted that I was downright embarrassed that Brad Pitt as producer cast himself in the role of the big white hero, his acting no better or worse than usual.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best performance was that of Paul Dano. As a white-trash overseer with middle-management power and impotent rage, he made me believe what these men might truly have been like in the times of American slavery.<br/><br/>How sad I am that this movie was not all it could have been. In the end, did it make me think? Yes, but for all the wrong reasons. Was I entertained, educated or moved? Sadly, I was not."
"secondtake","8","34","58","2 March 2014"," A direct telling of the horrors, but not quite the complexities, of a man kidnapped into slavery
","12 Years a Slave (2013)<br/><br/>Who can possibly argue against the power of this kind of movie, and the injustice that it waves as a welcome reminder? Superbly directed and acted (especially leading man Chiwetel Ejofor playing Solomon Northup), and set with high levels of realism in pre-Civil War America, there is little to separate what the filmmakers intended and what they achieved. A work of excellence.<br/><br/>It is not, however, quite the masterpiece it might have been. I don't mean the story or the level of competence here at all. I mean the way the story is told, the choice to simply tell it like it was.<br/><br/>That means that the presentation is quite linear (excepting a few gratuitous flashbacks that seem like a last minute editing decision). And uncomplicated. This is the biggest surprise. I mean, the basics might seem enough—a free black man in Saratoga goes to Washington and is kidnapped and made a slave, and he remains a slave until his recovery 12 years later. But that is actually the entire movie.<br/><br/>Oh, I know, the details are missing in that sentence. But it is these details where the movie succeeds too well. We are shown the horrors of slavery and made to experience them. It isn't that this is ignoble or unimportant. On the contrary, this is an ""important"" film and should be seen. But in some weirdly surreal way, we already know everything that happens in these details. <br/><br/>Do we need to see a woman, naked and tied to a post, whipped and whipped and whipped, with screaming in our ears? Many will say yes. We need to feel that horror even a little bit (through a movie) to understand how utterly unbelievably horrible slavery was. I would just argue back that I don't really want to be tortured directly to confirm what I already fully agree with. It's just a choice you want to make as a moviegoer. It's similar to watching a kidnapping movie—do you want to experience the inner and outer torments of the kidnapped, or see some larger view of a kidnapping situation and the complexities of that kind of plot?<br/><br/>For me, then the movie was excellent at being literal, but that's not enough. For example, there is absolutely no hint at what the family did when Solomon didn't return home after his trip to Washington. Did they search? Worry? How? Who helped, who ignored them? Etc. That's just one of many complexities the movie avoids for the sake of a direct experience of the protagonist. <br/><br/>I hope that gives a sense of where this unpleasant, terrific movie leaves you, and whether to watch it."

A silly comedy like ""Meet the Fockers"" or"" Legally Blonde"" is condemned as a complete waste of time.""I want my life back"" But a film lasting two and a half hours which shows a man kidnapped into slavery,beaten half to death and then rescued is considered worthy of 5 stars. If I had gone to the cinema alone I would have left after 15 minutes.What sort of people can enjoy watching other people being beaten senseless for two and a half hours.The only thing that kept me awake was the hope that the slaves would rise up and cut those nasty white throats.No such luck.The slave was rescued.A weak ending to to a weak pointless film."

","I was shocked with this film. I ended up wondering what on earth the director had in mind when he was making the film? The sad thing is that the subject of the film is extremely interesting but the director lost all chances of making this a great film.<br/><br/>Slavery in America is a huge issue indeed and I do understand that the Caucasian people in the US still try to deal with the issue. And most of them feel guilt. It is more or less how most Germans feel for the atrocities that Hitler has done. BUT someone expects that a film on slavery from an acclaimed director will either go into the core of the problem and prompt you to learn and understand things or will present a human story in a way that can create a case for the issue.<br/><br/>This film is doing nothing. It wastes 134 minutes to tell a story that could be told in no more than 15 minutes. When you have a 15 minutes storytelling then you need either to focus on building a characters' film or to insert in the storytelling questions that the viewer should consider. But instead of this the film is wasting all the good actors in an endless cycle of the same idea: ""what cruelty humans could cause to humans""!. But we DO KNOW this and we've seen it many times. Please make a point! The most hypocritical scene of the film is the Patsey's whip. Until that scene the film was boring, with this scene it became hypocritical because at that point I think that the director thought: ""I can not do a film about slavery without showing a cruel scene; I've forgotten to do this so far, so I do it now""! I learn nothing from the film and I didn't entertain myself at all. I am wondering why all cinema critics have given such victorious reviews. I am sorry to say that I think that the film tries to capitalize on the ""white people's guilty"" and the director has blackmailed the audience by saying: ""If you do not like it the film then you are just like the bad whites that they have done these things to the slaves"". I am sorry Mr. director, this is not the case, YOU have exploited the issue of slavery to put money in your pocket. You have succeeded and congratulations on the marketing success, but this is a bad film and will remain like this!"

","There is so much badness in our modern world and, because of the non-stop flood of digital information, it's coming at us ALL the time. Therefore, if I'm going to see a film about a horrible subject (which I'm not opposed to), I want to feel like I'm being subjected to it for a reason. I want to feel that the filmmaker has something to add to the conversation about it, draws some conclusions, makes a point that hasn't already been made. Otherwise, I feel like that much more badness has been added to my life for little purpose.<br/><br/>That is my problem with ""12 Years a Slave,"" a formally accomplished film but one which left me cold. It's two hours of watching the absolute worst humanity can inflict on itself, and beyond the fairly obvious point that slavery was a horrible dark stain on American history, there isn't much point to be made and certainly no sense of enlightenment on the subject. It's a film executed to make its audience feel bad, and it succeeds tremendously on those terms. But it fails in most other ways that make great movies truly great. I felt terrible for the slaves depicted in the film in the abstract, but the individual characters are never fully developed enough to feel bad about them as actual people. It's a hectoring film, one scene after another of hateful, brutal violence (physical, sexual, emotional) inflicted on one set of human beings by another, and the problem is that the people who will actually go to see this movie don't need to be told how terrible this kind of human evil is, while those who might serve to be enlightened on that subject wouldn't see a movie like this in a million years.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a solid performance in the central role of a free black man who's kidnapped and sold into slavery for a dozen years. But his character never really came alive for me, and that limited the impact of Ejiofor's performance. Michael Fassbender is just asked to play crazy as a villainous plantation owner, while Brad Pitt shows up toward the film's conclusion and makes a speech about the evils of slavery right before our main character is rescued. This scene and Pitt's appearance as pretty much the only white person in the movie who's not either evil or indifferent seems a bit convenient given that he's a producer of the film.<br/><br/>Sarah Paulson is memorable as Fassbender's equally villainous wife, while Alfre Woodard has a tiny role that teases us with the more complex issues about black and white relations in the slavery-era South that this film could have addressed had it been more interested in something other than the literalness of human suffering.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"chaos-rampant","Null","29","50","6 January 2014"," Persistently avoiding cleansing
","Going into a film like this you somewhat know what to expect. You ready yourself for callous suffering without end for no other reason than a system was just set that way, hope snuffed by despair. You know the injustice and stupidity will revolt, because it is just so blatantly wrong it baffles that it would be allowed to go on for even a day in plain sight.<br/><br/>We can't avoid the bluntness if we are to confront that world. Slaves are casually stabbed and thrown overboard on the journey south, a mother is separated by her kids in a slave sale, down at the bayous they are beaten, a girl flogged for wanting a piece of soap, treated at best as mischievous kids or at worst as animals. We see how our man is over the years beaten or numbly retreats to protect himself into a hollow shell. <br/><br/>But what good does it do if it merely blunts you to cleanse? <br/><br/>Serious question here. Most films work in this way, from the Greek model demanding catharsis, a cleansing from evil so that we can go on about our lives. But if we just go on about our lives merely relieved of a burden, has any actual change taken place? If I shed a few tears at a film like this and the next day take out my work stress on my kids, am I really cleansed of the same root ignorance that at one time supported slavery? Southerners were not in support of an apparent evil after all from their pov, but of what they saw as a right or a tradition or a natural necessity.<br/><br/>So I'm glad the film does these two things right, it's the only way it can truly be an eye-opener on the subject. <br/><br/>It runs the gamut of people who exist today with the same ignorance: among them the young overseer scorned because he was outsmarted, the jealous and neglected wife, the white worker who betrays the letter to jump ahead in his career, the plantation owner who is thoughtful yet won't buy the kid with his mother because of the cost.<br/><br/>And offers no catharsis. The exasperation is sweated out with a stoic capacity for having to be in the world, sentimental music doesn't try to waste all the pent-up energy into simple spine-tingling, the world itself is full of texture and sound because past the imposed confines there was still a world that extended in the distance and went on.<br/><br/>I would only have the first segment of normal life much longer so that we'd be more deeply torn from our safet. All that staring into a clump of sunset trees in the distance much more intense because somewhere beyond that is still home and a wife, and this is the greatest visual education I could wish for anyone: not giving up into suffering as not losing sight of the horizon where loved ones are. The notion of persistence solely visual in the arduous field work itself. And only a whole separate film could do justice to the richness of slave songs, their call and response, their hidden narrative and spontaneous order.<br/><br/>But a film that already calls up these intuitions has worked more than most, and any future film on the subject will have to build on this.<br/><br/>No cleansing because there's nothing to so easily pretend like we can cleanse ourselves of and leave behind in the theater, all the evil in the film does not arise from intrinsic evil itself (otherwise we'd never be able to become better persons) but conditional ego and ignorance and we live every day with these things. If you relieve us with catharsis all that energy goes away. If you don't, it becomes a ball of lead that we have swallowed and have to carry with us back home to our kids, so that maybe it can work its own answer in this life."

When slaves were supposed to be digging a paddock they were just tapping hoes on the ground. When slaves were cotton picking they were just playing with the cotton. All the slaves were over weight, and wore clean un-tatty clothes. Quite often the actors looked as though they were uncomfortable doing what they were doing. Those prolonged whipping scenes did not feel real. When he was left hanging, this again did not seem to be at all real. Someone wriggling a bit on the end of a rope. Where was the suspense and drama? Instead an overly long scene. Boring! It could have been a great film. But for me, it did not work at all. It would have been good to hear the story after he was released from slavery. How he tried to prosecute his captors. How he became an anti slavery campaigner. I do understand how for a lot of Americans this is the first time they have seen how slaves were treated in their country, but compared to Django Unchained, which was a great movie, this was awful."

","""12 Years a Slave"" is a gripping, mostly well-made, but basically false film. To say it finally shows the brutal truth about U. S. chattel slavery just proves how blind opinion-shapers are about U.S. racism, past and present.<br/><br/>Was the main outrage of slavery really that it could engulf a cultured, free black individual? That's what the hero suggests when, speaking to a sympathetic white, he protests the injustice of HIS captivity. As an afterthought, he also observes that slavery in general is unjust. Several of the other slaves with whom he interacts are inexplicably well-spoken and the camera lingers repeatedly on their faces to remind us of their stoic nobility.<br/><br/>The filmmaker shows keen understanding of psychological nuance in the relationships between masters, other whites, and slaves. He evidently meant to evoke viewer empathy with victims who seem to be a lot like ""us."" This film is meant to make liberals feel good about ""our"" distance from that world. It predictably has outraged some reactionaries who don't like exposing the warts of U.S. ""democracy.""<br/><br/>The main truth of U.S. slavery is not the story of extraordinary individuals either as victims or avengers but of ordinary people brutalized and traumatized, accommodating and finally resisting the private appropriation of their persons and their labor. The film that tells this truth won't be made until all those who labor, black and white, start speaking for themselves.<br/><br/>Rita Freed"

"ferguson-6","8","19","32","27 October 2013"," Live, not just Survive
","Greetings again from the darkness. Should this be labeled a historical drama? Is it one man's extraordinary tale of strength and survival? Does this fall into the ""art film"" category that so divides the movie-going public? The answer to all is YES, and I would add that it's a masterfully crafted film with exquisite story telling, stunning photography and top notch acting throughout.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the real life and writings of Solomon Northrup, a free man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery from 1841-53. Northrup's story provides us a look inside the despicable institution of slavery. Needless to say, it's a painful and sad process made even more emotional by the work of director Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame). McQueen takes a very direct approach. Not much is left to the imagination. Torture, abuse, cruelty and misery take up the full screen. The only subtlety comes from the terrific work of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northrup. His facial expressions and eyes are more powerful and telling than any lines of dialogue could be.<br/><br/>You will not find many details from the movie here. This is one to experience for yourself. It lacks the typical Hollywood agenda when it comes to American history. Instead this era is presented through the eyes of a single wronged man and his quest to return to his wife and kids, no matter the inhumane obstacles. We see Paul Giamatti as an emotionless, all-business slave trader. Benedict Cumberbatch is a plantation owner who has a heart, but lacks business savvy. And finally we enter the world of cotton farmer Michael Fassbender, who twists Bible scripture into threats directed at the slaves - his ""property"".<br/><br/>Fassbender dives deep into evil to find his character, and along with Ejiofor, Sarah Paulsen (who plays Fassbender's icy wife), and Lupita Nyong'o (who plays slave Patsey, the center of the two most incredible scenes in the film), provide more Oscar worthy performances than any one movie can expect. You will also note Quvenzhane Wallis (as Northrup's daughter) and Dwight Henry (as a slave) in their first appearances since Beasts of the Southern Wild. Other strong support comes from Scoot McNairy, Taran Killam (SNL), Michael K Williams, Alfre Woodward, a nasty Paul Dano, Garret Dillahunt and Adepero Oduye.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg gave us a taste of the holocaust with Schindler's List, but not since the TV mini-series ""Roots"" has any project come so close to examining the realities of slavery. Northrup's story seems to be from a different universe than the charming slaves of Gone with the Wind. I would argue that what makes this watchable (though very difficult) is the focus on Northrup's story. While tragic, his ending actually deflects from the ongoing plight of those not so fortunate. It's a story of a man who states he doesn't wish to merely survive, he wants to live a life worth living.<br/><br/>McQueen's direction will certainly be front and center come awards season, as will many of the actors, John Ridley (the screenwriter), Sean Bobbitt (cinematographer) and Hans Zimmer (score). The only question is whether the subject matter is too tough for Oscar voters, who traditionally lean towards projects a bit more mainstream."
"rodolphefleury-182-126991","3","22","38","29 January 2014"," Over rated
","Steve McQueen's first film was a masterpiece and since then it's seriously going downhill: Shame was pretentious and moralist and it didn't make me feel for the main character an film felt it was misogynistic in the way the main character's sister was being punished for him and for trying to be happy and alive. <br/><br/>Anyway, it at least had the merit to have style (even if it was over substance : I didn't learn anything I didn't know about sex addict) because 12 Years a Slave lacks this : style, it could have been directed by any Hollywood director. <br/><br/>There is a bit of Steve McQueen left in it (the hanging scene is a good example), but not much. First the music is atrocious and feels like it's been whacked in two minutes on garage band, not original, boring and useless except for one scene where the soundtrack gets menacing and slowly covers the Diegetic music that the main character plays. <br/><br/>The rhythm of the film is flawed, it's smoothed and fast at the beginning when the main guy is being kidnapped, then it's completely all over the place and you have the feeling that's it's been 4 years a slave and not 12. <br/><br/>It's also so Manichaean it's painful to watch : bad vs good. The hero is good, the guys that kidnap him are good but suddenly they're bad, the guys that ship him to the south are bad, and it carries on till then end, thank god there's a few good actors to bring some subtlety (Paul Dano is magnificent in his pure evilness and you detect some madness in him ), Michael Fassbender is a brutal drunk you kind of feel sorry for even if he is a pure monster. But then you Paul Giamati as bad bad ( in every way he's an awful actor with zero charisma and whose ugliness than no charm can even save), then it's poor black men and evil or cowardly white people : best example Cumberbatch who looks lost in the film, his wife bad woman, but the worse is the good white men : The hero's friend who is gentle and kind but is nothing else than kindness, his character clearly doesn't exist, and then there's Brad Pitt : being the producer of the film he gives himself the part of the good spirited and modern white man who is going to save the hero and lecture the bad Fasbender that there will be payback day for the bad things southerner are doing to slaves. And he looks like a Pre hippie kind of rebel mixed with his Chanel advert homeless look. At that point I felt like getting a pair of scissors and slashing the screen. <br/><br/>On top of that the film is ultra predictable, the hero is reunited to his family and he has a grandson and everybody cries (well what about all the poor other slaves? very subtle happy ending Mr McQueen) we are all supposed to cry. it's not the only emotional blackmail in the film the scene or the hero's lover is whipped, and he is forced to whip her, the scene is just pornographic violence, pointless in the film except forcing the spectator to cry. It's not about the whipping that is wrong it's the way the scene is depicted that is morally wrong, like the rape scene under a beautiful red moon, why should a horrible scene like that aesthetic and almost poetic, after Shame I really wonder what kind of problem Steve McQueen has with women. A lot more efficient is the hanging scene which is a long scene where the hero is hanging from a tree tip toe and trying not to be strangle by a rope while in the background business goes as usual: people doing their daily chores. It works because it shows how atrocity can happen anywhere anytime with a lovely weather in everyday life, that horror can take place in the ordinary, it's so understated and not stylized that it is refreshing, it's a long still shot and paradoxically it's one of the most interesting of the whole film. <br/><br/>The film is just a real story being told with no real message behind it : OK it's awful that freed black men were adducted in the north to be enslaved in the south but what is Steve McQueen is trying to say? That slavery is bad? well we figured that out and Spielberg made a better job with The Colour Purple , even Django Unchained is more convincing in depicting the atrocity of slavery, and even if it's caricature the characters in it are more authentic and subtle than in Manichaean 12 years a slave. OK so maybe it's about depicting the evil of earthlings? Well Manderlay and the The legend of n**** Charley's were more effective, because it at least knew what it wanted to be, and those were more believable while being pure fiction because their character had depth. The other massive flaw in the film is it's long and boring, some scenes are pointless, they don't help the story telling they have no message or do not give you any emotion. The dialogs are so contrived and theatrical that it's affects the whole film, you have the feeling that some scenes would be marvelous in a theater but not in cinema. Actually the film works best when Steve McQueen resolves to use visual to express himself than when he uses dialogs <br/><br/>You do get the feeling of anger there was in Hunger from times to times, mainly at the beginning but then it is dis-activated by all those boring illustrative and over explained scenes. I'm sorry but I don't want to get bored during a film that treat something as serious as slavery."

Some people might like that artsy stuff...but I just wanted to get on with the program already. Also the film just feels really long. Its only around 2 hours and 10 min long. But it felt like 3. And I realize that slavery was absolutely brutal but I just personally felt like the film was trying to much to make you cry and grab you by the heart. And I just didn't feel that way. And I'm not some robot. I cry a lot at movies. Last thing I didn't like, ""aging"" Solomon (Chiwetel). They add some grey to his hair to signify that 12 years had past. But did absolutely nothing else. He still looked the same. Plus, I don't even feel like the movie adequately showed that 12 years had gone by (except for the title, and at the end of the movie, his kids are grown up). I felt like there was no sense of time in the movie. It seemed like the events only took place over a year. None of the other characters ""aged"" either.<br/><br/>But those were my main problems with it. Otherwise, its a pretty decent flick and should be checked out at least for the performances."

I felt like ""12 Years a Slave"" offered little more on the slavery film than had been presented in the past.<br/><br/>I have technical complaints as well. I thought the acting was often over the top. The characters lacked real depth, subtlety, or originality. In life, are people always this one-dimensional? <br/><br/>Also, I never understand the need to place recognizable actors in small roles? It's distracting to see Michael K Williams (of ""The Wire"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"") in the film for only about 5 minutes (he had two scenes). Or Brad Pitt, or Paul Giamatti... it just is there to remind me that this is a big financial production and not a story.<br/><br/>Overall, I was simply too distracted by so many bad moments and production details to allow me to forget that this was basically big Hollywood ""Oscar-bait""."

","Like the whipping scenes we uncomfortably witness, in 12 Years a Slave the sting comes in the tail. The end titles tell us neither the slave pen manager nor Solomon Northup's kidnappers were punished. Solomon is saved, but that individual justice does not redefine the terrible system. Racism, slavery and savage injustice persist at film's end. Of course, the point is that even after the Civil War, the freeing of the slaves, the Civil Rights Movement and its legal and societal successes, racism and injustice persist. Hardly a major daily newspaper passes without a reminder, whether it's a regressive change in the voters' rights laws or a Florida bully justified in ""standing his ground"" against the unarmed black kid he hunted. 12 Years a Slave reminds us what contemporary America grew out of and where too much of its roots remain. <br/><br/>McQueen's film deploys an uncompromising visceral violence that rejects the sentimentality and softened focus of American treatments of that period. There is such violence in the air that steamboat paddles churn up a riot of raucous white water and the boat's furnaces roar infernal. The Southern swamps have an eerie other-worldliness that sets up the ghosts of slavery past as a still haunting presence. <br/><br/>Apparently it takes an outsider to cast such an unflinching eye on the subject. To his credit, the physical world and the language seem perfectly realized. No trace of the outsider there, but the work of a director steeped in his subject's world. Perhaps the only false note is producer Brad Pitt appearing as the Canadian who brings Northup salvation. His performance is fine but he can't stop registering as Brad Pitt, who gets to make the film's wisest and most humane and modern speeches. Whether his casting was his or McQueen's idea, it shivers the film's verisimilitude and seems self-congratulatory. Pitt brings Northup's story to the North as outside the narrative he helps bring it to the screen. <br/><br/>But that is a minor cavil about a film that's courageous, brilliantly written, scored, directed and performed, and as important a statement to America and the world as we have seen this year.

","Let's be honest about it: this spotlight on the darkest days of American history is a particularly British triumph. The brilliant director (and artist) Steve McQueen and outstanding Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the eponymous Solomon Northup, are both British; even Michael Fassbender, in the main support role as a sadistically brutal slave-owner, is half British; and Benedict Cumberbatch makes an appearance as a 'kinder' slave owner.<br/><br/>But, of course, there is a vast array of American talent here too. As always, Sean Bobbitt is inspiring as director of photography, making full use of the Louisiana locations. And a host of fine US actors make cameo appearances, notably Brad Pitt (who was one of the 10 producers), Paul Giamatti (looking as if he had walked straight out of the TV mini series ""John Adams""), Sarah Paulson and Alfre Woodard. In her first film role, Lupita Nyong'o gives a heart-rending performance as a young slave who is horrendously abused. Original music by Hans Zimmer and use of contemporary songs add to the searing atmosphere of the work<br/><br/>McQueen is unrelenting in his focus: except for short pieces at the beginning and the end of the film, all the time is the period in captivity and, except for occasional glimpses of humanity, we see the slaves subjected to humiliation and horror again and again and again. McQueen's style is slow and penetrating with some long and wordless scenes totally captivating.<br/><br/>As a piece of social history, this movie is simply stunning - a virtual blow to the solar plexus. As a cinematic work, it has some challenges: there is no conventional narrative arc in which a plot unfolds or a character develops because Northrup is confined to a small geographical space where he can only survive by keeping as low a profile as possible; the characters are literally black and white with little subtlety or nuance; and there is not really a sense that the period of incarceration is more than a decade.<br/><br/>At the start and finish of the film, we are reminded that this is a true story based on the book written by Northup in 1853, once he finally re-acquired his freedom (in a pedestrian act of bureaucracy rather than anything more dramatic or violent). As if Northup has not suffered enough, we learn that his legal actions against both those who sold and bought him failed in the courts. A special award should go to McQueen's Dutch partner Bianca Stigter who discovered Northup's book and recommended it to the director."

There was no surprise with the sadism and inhumanity; as far as I am concerned, moreover, it added nothing new to the already tragic picture of slavery in America. It would be more interesting to understand how humanity was able to deal with slavery and why it produced such extraordinary sadism in the white population.

"sergioglopez1980","1","26","51","2 April 2014"," A biased, politically motivated movie that pretends to be historically accurate
","The movie is filmed artfully and it certainly portrays the evils of racism and slavery in a historically accurate way. However, practically all that evil is subtly (and not so subtly) blamed on the Bible, which is far from being historically accurate. Moreover, it is theologically flawed. The main driving force behind chattel slavery was and is economical, not theological. It is true that in the days in which slavery was still legal the Bible was repeatedly misquoted in order to justify such an abuse, but it is also true that the Bible was the main driving force behind the most important abolitionist movements both in the USA and everywhere else in the world. In this movie Christianity is indicted with being the sole origin of the evils associated with slavery, without showing that true Christians were among the only ones who were trying to end slavery once and for all. <br/><br/>To prove that I have evidence to support my claim I will say that in ancient Israel slavery differed greatly from the sort of slavery that used to be commonplace in the USA. In ancient Israel people chose to sell themselves and their children as slaves (actually, serfs is a more accurate term), since they saw slavery not as an oppressive system, but as a sort of welfare institution. Nobody in his right mind would have himself as a slave 19th century USA. Likewise, no one would have sold their children into slavery. This shows that Biblical slavery or serfdom was vastly different from USA slavery. Moreover, the lives of the serfs was protected by the Bible, as opposed to the lives of the American slaves, which depended entirely on the will of the masters. Moreover, Christianity has always been a driving force behind abolitionist movements, from ancient Rome to our own times (slavery is still commonplace in the Middle East and Christian groups are among the few that fight against it). Anyway, I believe that this movie is crap because it shows only one side of the story and completely neglects the other, while positing as a historically accurate depiction of American slavery."

","12 Years a Slave goes straight for the shock effect. Solomon, a supposedly sensitive, intelligent, kind violinist and family-man is captured to be shipped and sold as a slave. In roughly ten minutes the movie shows how good he had it and then how bad it becomes. Meaning you can almost do without anything that comes after that. People trick him with the promise he can play the violin in a circus, he wakes up in cuffs and is beaten relentlessly. He's sold several times. Meanwhile Solomon tries to distinguish himself from fellow slaves in a manner that isn't particularly sympathetic. He's whipped a lot, others are whipped a lot, some die and all is shown very explicitly. Then, in the last 15 minutes or so, Brad Pitt turns up and saves the day. That's basically the whole darn thing in a nutshell. <br/><br/>In my opinion the end seems sloppy and rushed. Secondly - and most importantly - the story line would've had more meaning to it, if it would've been portrayed with more subtlety and would've been less about going from one beating to the next. It gives the impression this movie is just to shock and provoke, instead of inciting any feelings, or thoughts. If you look at a film like ""La Vita E Bella"", you know even just hints can make one feel misery, heartbreak and despair much stronger than if you spell it out. When a film triggers our imagination, one feels moved and touched, with all the emotions belonging to a certain situation. Unless you want to numb the viewer, instead of getting him/her emotionally involved. In that case, this movie was perfect."

"ironhorse_iv","9","10","17","11 January 2014"," A powerful movie that brings in new light to the dark topic of slavery.
","12 Years a Slave is indeed a very powerful movie. Directed by Steve McQueen, and written by John Ridley, the movie is an adaptation of the 1853 autobiography by Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a New York State-born free man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery in the South. Chiwetel Ejiofor did a great job, acting as Solomon Northup, and it wouldn't surprise me, if he wins a couple of awards for it. The supporting cast is just as amazing. I give mad props to both Benedict Cumberbatch, and Michael Fassbender for their performance as plantation owner, beloved William Ford and crude Edwin Epps. There are too many powerful performances scenes to count, but I had to choice some, it would be, the scene where Solomon is nearly lynch by John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and he is just hanging out there, while the other slaves couldn't do anything about it. Last is the trials and misfortune of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) with her being abuse by both Epps and his evil wife played by Sarah Paulsen. The movie doesn't have too much over the top moments, and seem very accurate. The movie puts a lot of insight, you wouldn't see in much modern movies today. First off, there is the good heart, slave owner William Ford. You would never see that in any other movie, as movies about slavery have all slave owners as a crude one-dimension evil human beings. Second off, you wouldn't see a white field hand (Garret Dillahunt) working besides the slaves in other films. To accurately depict the time period of the film, the filmmakers did a great job capturing the language, the look, and locations of the time. Still, the film did take artistic license, and create some new drama like the scene where a sailor kill a slave. One thing, I didn't like about the film is some of the music. Don't get me wrong, I found the songs, Roll Jordan Roll, and the classical American folk music great, but the soundtrack by Han Zimmer is kinda sound not new. Most of the emotional music being play in the background, remind me too much of 'Time' from Han Zimmer's 2010 soundtrack for the film, 'Inception'. It's seem recycled. Another thing that is bothering people is the flow of the film over the 12 years. It seems to go, really quick over the years. When he was kidnapped in the beginning, his children were kids and he looked about mid 30's. Throughout the movie he doesn't look any older at all or aged. The point is, they could have done was to add the age look for the characters because you can't tell that 12 years are going by or let us know that time is passing by. But it didn't feel like 12 years for me. It more felt like a matter of about 4 months. Maybe if they had showed seasons changing or done makeup on the actors to show them getting older it would have been better. About the brutality of the film, it was there, it wasn't too gruesome in my opinion. It was a lot harder to watch 1997's Amistad than this. I wouldn't say, this movie is for all audience, but I do agree, young mature adults should watch it. I don't find the movie, putting a white guilt to anybody, nor do I say, this is a movie trying to start hatred against whites for their ancestor mistakes. If anything, it is part of the healing process, for the most part, I found myself, not anger, but understanding what people went through back then. Most black audiences would agree with me. I have to say, all people of every race need to see this film, even if it's not teaching you anything new that you don't already know. The reason why people should see this film is indeed, while slavery seems like old practice, it still acts upon the modern world through sex trade, and the misused of illegal workers. Such modern sense of slavery need to quickly end. Indeed, if you like this movie, do check out, 1984's TV movie, Solomon Northup's Odyssey starting Avery Brooks. It's well done as well. Overall: While it did had a limited release, it is a must watch."

You can't just cram injustice and suffering into 2hours and then abruptly finish it with a passing ""mailman"" messiah and slap the audience with a pitiful apology after a long-awaited reunion. I mean yeah but that should not be all to it. Can't we at least have a true ending to make up for that 2 hours of hell? There was no emphasis of raw emotions other than pain. No compassion, curiosity and worry from the family's perspective (i.e. Running, screaming, hugging, closeup shot on Solomon's face, showing apparent tears and a genuine smile). Despite it being a very brutal situation, it doesn't touch me at all because the movie doesn't show anything besides suffering... Too scared to show any happiness. Just constant pain, anger, and hurt. When in truth that's not realistic. He must've made temporary friends during that 12 years with little joys here and there - which were not included to guarantee maximum agony. Perhaps in the hope that audience will sympathise better but no, it does the opposite. You see I did not watch this movie because I enjoy sadism but that's about all this movie had to offer. If you're going to touch the subject of slavery at least make it educative and inspiring. Some love at the end, some countermeasure, changes, revolutionary movement, true liberty.. would've completed this film. If you're looking for a moving beautiful art, no you won't find it here. Stay away because this title really has nothing other than sadism that would leave you feeling absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>Though it does make me think: Why does it matter so much that Solomon was a free black man? Held up high like a status, like he is better than the other black slaves. And yes he was and the movie insinuates that so many times, when truly every person should be EQUALLY free. And that *should* be the message. But it wasn't. Rubs me the wrong way. Oh yeah Bass said some great stuff but ultimately we never saw our main character living up to those quotes. Solomon didn't give a dang about slavery until he became one himself. And this was never corrected. """"We live in hierarchy. Some people are less and more than you. If you have the privilege, flaunt it and own your rights! Who cares about those below you!"""" They chose what to display and they don't wanna show you any character development nor progress, just the bad stuff.

It's easy, you don't need  imagination, creativity or an excellent screenplay - you just need the  right subject matter; something historical, a biopic (almost always  with a 'snappy' title taken from the subjects last name) or something  related to war, civil rights, anything political, anything about  disabilities or social injustice. Although these movies do not win the  award, you can be sure as hell they will be in the running, movie  producers have that power at least.  There is no style to this movie whatsoever - anybody could have made  it. I don't believe Steve Mcqueen had any opportunity to express  himself. The movie was not his idea, but again the idea of Oscar hungry  producers who got a hold of an 'Oscar worthy' idea and decided what the  movie would be. I'm sure they knew exactly what they wanted before  hiring Mcqueen for his name, which would be powerful enough to bring in  more attention, while he himself is not so established a director as to  threaten the studio with his ambition or movie making principles.   Two cameo appearances rubbed me up the wrong way. Firstly Paul  Giamatti's role as some form of slave trade administrator, which lasted  about a minute and a half. Earlier in his career Giamatti was known to  have played these bit-parts and although perhaps not quite a household  name, he is a well recognised face who one could imagine taking the  lead in an Oscar winning movie. The fact that he appears for such a  short time suggested his inclusion was a cheeky nod from the director  to say ""Look, it's Paul Giamatti. We are friends. We must be friends  otherwise why would he agree to such a minor role?""   The second cameo that bothered me was where Brad Pitt popped up about  half an hour from the end. Now I love Pitt, but again this is not the  role for him. I had the horrible feeling that the producers managed to  hire him for one afternoon before he had to rush back to making  whichever movie he was really interested in making. Pitt appeared in  two scenes, made one medium sized monologue about the injustice of the  slave trade (which was far too blunt) and had a short conversation with  the lead about delivering a letter which would see him freed. When you  are this far into a movie you are supposed to be glued to the story. If  you go to see a Brad Pitt movie where he is in a leading role, you  should be forgetting that it is Pitt early on and only be thinking of  the character from there on, but when Pitt showed up about one hour  forty into 12 Years a Slave, it just drew me out of the movie. Instead  of thinking ""Who is the new character at the plantation"" I and I am  sure everyone was thinking ""Oh, Brad Pitt! I didn't know he was in this  movie."" I also guarantee many viewers were not listening to what his  character was saying as they too busy giggling at the sight of him  kitted out in the appropriate clothing complete with old-timey facial  hair.   Cameos should be left to more lighthearted genres where it is OK for  the audience to be well aware that they are watching a movie. These  cameos felt like such amateur mistakes.   The fact that the producers hoped the subject matter would be enough to  win the Oscar is so evident from the lack of substance in the movie.  All that happens is that a free black man is abducted (somehow) and  lives as a slave for many years. He has a horrible time of it as do the  other slaves...that's it. The movie ends very quickly so as to disguise  the fact that they did not know how to finish the movie. Nothing occurs  between the time the lead actor asks Pitt's character to deliver the  letter (despite talk of the risks involved in delivering the letter -  this goes nowhere and we see nothing) the carriage shows up to free him  and that is that. Predictably, what details of Solomon's life the  screenplay could not find room for was hurriedly read from the screen  prior to the end credits.   Least favourite moment for me was where Soloman was strung up by the  neck and left on his tippy-toes in the mud, struggling to keep himself  upright enough as not to choke to death. This was supposed to be  horrible and uncomfortable and I understand that was the purpose of the  scene and the reason for it's longevity - but they overdid it. The  scene felt like about 3 minutes long and soon I was not just keen for  it to end because Solomon was choking, but rather I was irritated at  the sound of the mud under his feet. When one is more concerned with  his own ears than the main character's neck, it is pretty clear that  errors have been made.  The 5 stars I have given this movie are for the actors, make-up  artists, costume department and visual effects people etc."
"kenvadnais","1","25","51","30 May 2014"," Stupidest movie I've seen in a long time..
","This was an awful depiction of the life/times of the era. The plight of the slave was considerable worse. A slave would've never been allowed to act the way this main character would've..the slaves could not speak proper English, let alone command the language enough to effectively insult/manipulate their captives.<br/><br/>The ""masters"" were as uneducated and unrefined as their slaves..but they were in control..period. ROOTS was a considerably better depiction of the times.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed, is the only emhasise of the time was the reference to both the master and slave. Although it was accurate, the language spoken was of illiterate people..both master and slave. The only ones who had mastered the language were the land owners themselves.<br/><br/>I'm so appalled by this thinly veiled attempt to target the white man in general. We must never forget that the north was republican and the south was democrat, who insisted on slavery..which is what the civil war was all about.<br/><br/>Appalled...simply appalled.. the acting alone was worth steering clear of this atrocity that claims to represent the horrible times of the era...absolutely appalled.<br/><br/>I think I'll watch ROOTS again to regain my perspective of that horrible stain on America's history...because this film accomplished the opposite of what it so blatantly attempted to do."

","This is another version of the movie Pianist. Black man instead of Jewish man, and violin instead of piano. In Pianist, the guy was just hiding through out the movie; in 12 Years Slave, the guy is just waiting for help instead. He waits and does whatever he is told to. He is taking no action, no fight for freedom and more than anything..no helping anyone.<br/><br/>I really forced myself to watch the rest of the movie after the first 20-25 minutes. All of the scenes were unsurprising. Giving the Best Picture Oscar to this movie is like giving Peace Nobel to Bush. I think Hollywood will never give up awarding white-slave and Nazi-Jew movies. I wander if they will ever make Jew-Palestinian movie and award it! <br/><br/>I have to admit one thing though: The end was very touching. I couldn't hold my tears. But it had to belong to another movie."
"supatube","10","9","15","11 March 2014"," ""I hated it, walked out in 15 minutes""
","Do tell, how can one hate a film if one does not see it to the end? It's not like this was Legally Blonde 2, you needed to get a bit involved. Like actually watch, soak up, ask questions and interpret, not be force fed the filmmakers intentions. This was not a kids movie, so why be simple?<br/><br/>Furthermore, how can one not see how this film was structured around fear and not hatred? It so clear how it was showcasing fear, but I guess some need narration. <br/><br/>Even more - why do white people today take slavery so personal? I'm white and not once did I familiarise myself with anybody but Solomon, because he was the main character, the one i was suppose to be involved with. Does his skin really mean we won't feel the same in similar situations? <br/><br/>This movie is impeccable to say the least. So after viewing I thought ""If a reviewer hated this film, what were the reasons?"" Needless to say I was disappointed in the response. There are many, non-personal, reasons to hate a film. The lack of thought in terms of film leads me to believe that the haters are actually just racist. Not because they would do similar stuff to a black person but because they needed to see white people not be SO evil. Their logic for hating it was not based on film, it just was not. <br/><br/>There is one long shot, where he hangs in the tree. He hangs for a while holding himself up with his neck and toes. The other workers slowly come out and carry on. This is because the film is about fear. His peers did not help him because of fear. <br/><br/>Mistress Eps only beat Patsy, why? Fear. Fear that Patsy meant more to her husband than she. Ford was too scared to help a man he knew should be helped. Edwin Eps was scared of loosing his power. And all the slaves are scared on the most basic principle - they could die. <br/><br/>The beating was relentless - but I believe it to be. If a person is going to strip a woman and lash her then why would he suddenly develop a moral compass and say ""Only three lashes?"" Im sure that compass was broken to begin with. <br/><br/>""It was difficult to sit through"" well I am sure it was even more difficult to live through... my goodness, at least we only had to experience it for two hours, not twelve years - with a drink and snack no less.<br/><br/>""It was one sided, depicting black as good and white as evil"" it did? I am pretty sure I witnessed Solomon loose it a few times although confined to his circumstances. When Solomon refused to take his shirt off for a beating and stood up for himself, he could have just taken the whip away instead he beat him. Inflicting that kind of pain is not being the better person.<br/><br/>And, from one reviewer's opinion to another - I believe this film is leaps and bounds better than ""Citizen Kane"", ""Paths of Glory"", ""M"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Amadeus"", ""2001-A Space Odyssey"", or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" but, an opinion of how great a film is can usually be explained by how old the viewer is when they first saw it. And all mentioned were screened before my birth, so excuse the lacklustre feeling towards the oldies.<br/><br/>It deserves accolade in the history books of film.""12 Years a Slave"" was relentless in making me feel, and I adore the film for taking me to such emotional depths - even if I probably won't sit through it again."

","Ultimately, that is the question I ask myself whenever I see a movie at the cinemas. Was it worth the 16 dollars admission fee? Unfortunately, no.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong. I did like Shame. However, 12 Years A Slave pushes the audience so far in its historical chapter of human depravity that you won't take anything from this film, but it will take something from you... your innocence. <br/><br/>Films like Shindler's List, It's A Wonderful Life, and Shawshank Redemption have successfully entertained us. This is due to their pacing and inspirational denouements. 12 Years A Slave unrelentingly portrays the horrible subject without any moments of humour or kindness that helps break the tension. <br/><br/>This is why this film cannot be considered amongst the great films suggested, because it teaches us nothing we don't already know nor does it give us any inspiration. <br/><br/>Who is Solomon? He is just a man waiting for someone to save him. Is he charming? Funny? An opportunist? A man that takes charge of his life? No, and this is why the Law of Diminishing Return comes into full throttle. He doesn't do anything but wait, while practice of torture escalates into something thats boring. I wanted to feel bad for the slaves, but their is no background or history invested to make you truly empathise with the characters. For that reason, the relationship between the 'black man' and the 'white man' feels too clinical. <br/><br/>I walked out of this film having lost something. Many of the audience quietly exited feeling the same, I'm sure. If you can, don't pay for this movie."

","First of all, I'd like to say, sorry to the other movies nominated for movie of the year that lost to this horrid piece of propaganda bull. You were all wrongfully denied, by reviewers that gave it the movie of the year nomination without even seeing it. As the popular saying goes with this movie now: ""You're a racist if you don't like this movie"".<br/><br/>Well, if that is the case, call me a racist. The movie itself had promises of telling an accurate portrayal of a free victim who had his freedom taken away; from his family and everything he has ever known. There was some glimmering promises that could have made this a decent movie, but as soon as those events happened, the propaganda would start over again; ruining the original point given.<br/><br/>The acting by the supporting cast is at best lackluster. They acted as if every white person in this movie was hell bent on torturing blacks or was just a complete moron; unaware of what was going on around the time. A fact that was never mentioned in the movie either; over 80% of the population in the south never owned a slave. I guess they wanted to portray the 20% as the majority.<br/><br/>The first owner of Solomon was portrayed as supposedly a 'good man', but obviously lacked of any intelligence. Even with the unbelievable sophistication and knowledge Solomon showed, the owner still would not believe he was anything but a slave when Solomon told him he was not. I don't know if it was the overacting of Solomon's character or what, but there is no way a pure slave during that time period would possess those abilities; let alone having someone dumb enough not to notice that fact. And don't even get me started that the slave owner was doing him a 'favor' by sending him off to an owner that was referred to as a 'slave breaker'.<br/><br/>After that, the movie continues to get worse for the next hour or so as it is just basically a white person continuously beating on a black person for one reason or another.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie, Solomon meets a decent white person; but alas he's from Canada (as there is no such thing as a decent white person in the south supposedly...) played by Brat Pitt. He gets Solomon's letter out and eventually the authorities come and free Solomon. The movie ends with a couple lines saying that Solomon goes to trial over the events that happen but loses due to an 'all white congress'.<br/><br/>If you want to learn about black history and what happened during the times of slavery, this movie is not the place to go to. Find a proper history book and learn for yourself instead of this director's skewed view of events that transpired then."
"tavm","10","14","26","26 November 2013"," 12 Years a Slave is quite a compelling depiction of slavery at its most harrowing
","Just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working friend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home state) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who paid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and I have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I highly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here. Oh, and nice shots of the Louisiana locations."

There was literally nothing else to this movie that offered new insights and an opening scene designed to nothing but shock and disgust. There is nothing even admirable about the main character that's worth noting, I don't understand why we are following his story in particular. There is plenty of better movies about history and dehumanisation of races with protagonists worth following, like The Pianist."

","I must have watched a totally different film to every body else. Solomon Walthop is a free man living in Saratoga. He travels to Washington, where he is known to polite society. He meets up with two Gentlemen, who invite him out to dinner and get him drunk. He is sick everywhere. Next thing, you see him in shackles and in a dungeon. he is beaten and you find out, that he has been kidnapped and sold into slavery. So far i find the film interesting. Then for 1 hour and 50 minutes you watch people being whipped, beaten, hanged and a black slave crying throughout the film. all the white people, with the exception of the slaver Ford and the Canadian Abolishinist, played by Brad Pitt, look as if they are portraying the character Simon Le Green from Uncle Toms Cabin and Pitt who is supposed to be playing a Canadian, sounds more like Patrick Swayze out of North And South, which in my opinion is the best ever depiction of that period. A story like this cannot be told in a couple of hours anyway. A far superior film to this was Amistad by Spielberg, which was also based on a true story. Yes you see whippings, but you see the the taking over of the ship and then the court proceedings. In this film you only know what happened to the bad guys at the end credits. My opinion is this was like a rehash of two other terrible movies based on two very good books, Mandingo and Drum, also with fine actors and actresses. Although this one is better made. Very disappointing."

The ""whites"" in the movie over acted and it was like watching a high school play. The accents were ridiculous, especially Brad Pitt's one note, overdone ""Southern accent"" when he supposed to be Canadian. His dialog with Michael Fassbender's slave owner character was absurd and unrealistic. His hero stand would not have been tolerated. Frankly, I came away from this finding it hard to believe this was actually written by a slave. Too many pieces don't fit together of a survivor's account."
"bob the moo","Null","17","33","12 January 2014"," Absorbing, brutal and moving in a detached and visually beautiful way
","A few years ago now, Mel Gibson made Passion of the Christ; a film which essentially is one long tale of suffering of Jesus on his way to the cross. It was a film that I found to be as vacuous as pornography and an ordeal to sit through because I lost all feeling for the character as he became little more than the subject for violence. I mention this because I worried that this film would be the same as it is very much an issue film and much has been written about how numbing it is in terms of the content. I decided to watch it anyway, mainly because of the British involvement in the film – a lot of talent here, not least of which is director Steve McQueen.<br/><br/>The story is based on the true story of a free man kidnapped into slavery. As a story it is one of interest but mainly it provides a central tangible point for the audience to identify with and to follow. It also gives us the oft-used narrative device of a character seeing things for the first time as we are (see also the rookie cop etc). In this way it works very well because we never really get lost in the violence or brutality of the film and, despite the claims of some, it never made me numb to it and it never felt like it was being overdone for the sake of it – if anything it builds very well so it get progressively harder to process. The film shows the extent of the system much better than just a series of beatings; it shows that even ""good"" men are part of it, it shows that the options are zero and it shows that it is a world that has no edges – even though we know that Solomon is just a matter of distance from his rightful freedom, we never really feel that way at all because it is never escaping one place or one person.<br/><br/>The story is well told to keep close to Solomon while also letting us see the reality and McQueen is excellent as director in how he shows it. In Hunger and Shame he sits back from his subjects in a rather detached but invasion way. It is hard to describe but long, wide shots leave us to observe simple scenes and often the simpler they are the more telling – as Solomon hangs while others go about their business, we understand the reality of this world and how utterly trapped everyone is – again, it is a system, this is just how it works. The relationship with Bobbitt continues to pay dividends because visually the film is stunning, great colors and great shots whether they be unflinching close-ups or wide and long. The use of music is good too – there is no sentimentality to it and when it is used it is subtle. This is not a film that overdoes the violence to hype it, but nor is a film that pulls on the heartstrings – it feels very factual and very realistic within the context of the system, so while the audience flinch at a particular brutal scene, the film itself does not – because this is how it is in the world we are in.<br/><br/>The cast give very good performances in support of this goal, so while some of them are basic roles, the people give good presence and don't ham it up. In particular Ejiofor gets the balance right, his desperation and horror is pushed down as much as he can because of how the system he is in works, but he engages and moves throughout. Fassbender likewise walks the line – he is never a pantomime villain but he is still cruel and hateful. Supporting roles from Nyong'o, Dano, Williams and many others is roundly very good with only one misstep which is Pitt, which is a shame – his face is almost too famous and breaks the ensemble feel, plus the virtue of his character also makes his casting in that specific role seem a little bit like a vanity casting for a producer. This is a minor thing though, since he himself is not bad, but anyway the rest of the cast are convincing and engaging.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave looks like it will be just another Oscar-baiting slavery film, but it is much better than that to be fair the awards hype sullies it a little bit. It is absorbing and brutal in its convincing and detached portrayal of this world, complete with strong performances it is a memorable experience and very well made film."

For god'sake, this ridiculous depiction of how the northern states of the US was an idyllic utopia for black people (and only the nasty evil south was racist) is not even true NOW in 2014! Never mind how much this distorts the reality of the early 19th century. You can go to Phildelphia, get on a bus, see the black homeless lying in the street, see how STILL America has not made amends for the abomination that was slavery.

","I was so looking forward to this film. I loved Hunger, didn't see Shame, but was expecting this to be outstanding. I will try to express why I felt so underwhelmed by it. I know this is a depiction of the horrors of slavery, but I expected more than that - and that's all I got, relentless and horrific. There was something off and pointless about it. In terms of characterisation, we are shown how Solomon lives with his family as a free man in New York, seemingly oblivious to the plight of slaves. Then he gets kidnapped and spends the next 12 years under sadistic evil masters and has to survive. Then he gets an enlightened Northener to get his freeman papers and rescue him. He is back with his family in the end, but all we get is his relief to be out of that hell. How is that a new angle on slavery? There is a scene early on with Solomon buying a travel case, observed by a slave, but given the context of the film it is a bit of a loose end and not tied properly. In short: Pros: Some of the acting is very good, especially Lupita N. and Michael Fassbender. Some good set pieces, great costumes, production design, sound design. Cons: Too long, story edit all over the place, cinematography OK but no great shakes(considering the stunning locations), too slow and I'd never thought I'd say this - but direction was boring.<br/><br/>I attended a Q&A with director, star and DoP, which was a bit inane as well. Director got defensive about criticism of violence. I get his point about portraying the truth about what happened, but add some damn believable story as well please!"

","The greatest blot on humanity ever imposed by humans was and will remain slavery. It is the lowest form of how one human can exploit another. Then it does not matter if it is sex slavery or slavery to pick cotton. 12 years a slave reminds us what some of the previous generations of humans had to go through just to survive.<br/><br/>Based on 18th century America, it is the true account of a free black man and how he is tricked and sold into slavery, separated from his family for a period of 12 years and how he survives those gruesome times. Faced with different experiences of kindness from one slave owner to absolute inhuman brutality from another, the protagonist manages to hold his ground facing adverse conditions. Some of the scenes portrayed in the movie are so gruesome and inhuman, you want to turn your face away from the screen. The act of considering another human as an animal just because he/she is of a different skin color comes as normal as sunshine on a summer morning to the white antagonists. <br/><br/>Acting is one of the strong points here. One of the few movies, where each and every actor plays his/her part almost brilliantly. The protagonist black man played by Chiewetel Ejiofor is a revelation. Surely, the front-runner for this years Oscar Awards for best actor. Michael Fassbender as the cruel slave owner disgusts you so much, you want to kill that bastard. The passion for cruelty which he portrays is awe-inducing. The simultaneous innocence and weakness portrayed by Lupita Nyong'o as Fassbender's sex slave leaves you teary-eyed. Definitely, the break-through performance of the year. A Small role by Benedict Cumberbatch and a cameo by Brad Pitt are perfect.

"PWNYCNY","10","9","16","4 November 2013"," A candid depiction of a depraved institution.
","This movie provides a candid and dramatically powerful depiction of the institution of slavery in the United States. This movie touches on and in some ways dives into the many different themes associated with the institution. First, the movie shows how it corrupted everyone involved in it. No matter what their involvement, the institution brought everyone down. Second, the movie dramatizes the political consequences of slavery, how slavery exacerbated sectional conflicts and distorted political discourse. Third, the movie dramatizes the deleterious psychological effects of slavery. Unwilling to come to honestly come to terms with the nature of the institution, the movie shows how slave owner rationalized their own conduct toward the slaves, with devastatingly tragic consequences. Fourth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the United States to follow its own creed of liberty and justice by showing how free blacks were denied the full protection of the law. Fifth, this movie dramatizes the essential barbarism and degeneracy of slavery in the way it brought out and validated the worst in people. Sixth, the movie shows how slavery was a form of state-sponsored vigilantism in the way an entire class of people were subject to the full weight of the state with absolutely no protection. Seventh, the movie pulls no punches in showing the brutality of the institution, e.g., graphic depictions of beatings, whippings, fighting, psychological torture, humiliation, dehumanization, inadequate food, clothing, shelter, and terrorism - all happening under the color of law. Eighth, movie dramatized how by 1841 there was those who already realized that the United States was heading toward a civil war. Ninth, the movie shows how economic self-interest drove slavery, that slavery was profitable. Tenth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the religious community to take action to end slavery and instead used scripture to justify slavery's existence. This movie features many excellent performances, most notably by Michael Fassbinder and Brad Pitt, the latter giving one of his better performances. As for Fassbinder, his performance warrants an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His portrayal of the angry, troubled, vicious slave owner who is deteriorating physically, mentally and spiritually carries this movie. This movie is worth watching. Don't expect an upbeat story, because it isn't. But do expect a powerful dramatic treatment of an unpleasant yet historically important subject."

","""12 Years A Slave"" (15) Director: Steve McQueen. Starring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o. Rated: 15 for containing, strong violence, injury detail, sex, nudity and racist terms. Running time: 134 minutes. Out now in UK cinemas.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" reveals the disconsolate tale of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man from the year 1841, who was deceived, kidnapped and sold into slavery. <br/><br/>Steve McQueen is particularly well known for creating works of fragility, including his last two pieces ""Shame"" and ""Hunger"", which are both of an extremely high standard. Now having completed his third feature length film, Steve McQueen has decided to tackle a delicate subject, which requires the utmost respect; and received it. The film is at times extremely brutal, but delivers a completely honest insight into slavery and the effects it had on our society.<br/><br/>Placed in development for quite some time, it wasn't until 2011 that Steve McQueen finally announced his next film would be ""12 Years a Slave"", after the success of ""Shame"". Originally, the screenwriter John Ridley was reluctant to join the film until his wife recommended that he read Solomon Northup's book. Soon afterword, John began to collaborate with McQueen and the rest (as they say), is history. <br/><br/>Dealing with something so disturbing, needs a cast which can become the characters they are meant to be portraying, no matter how cruel. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a revelation in the role of Solomon, previously only portraying supporting characters in many of his roles including his performance in the stunning film, ""Children of Men"" (a film by Alfonso Cuaron) alongside Clive Owen. Finally receiving the lead role he was born to play, Chiwetel is not only convincing, but unbelievable as he physically degrades himself, by acting in many uncomfortable scenes; including a scenario where Solomon is strung up by his neck for a large amount of time. <br/><br/>The film's supporting cast also includes Michael Fassbender, who plays a barbarous slave owner named Edwin Epps, whose uncontrollable hate leads to many vivid scenes of violence upon his slaves. Perhaps the actress given the most amount of attention during the current awards season is Lupita Nyong'o (Lupita only formerly acted in a short film named ""East River""), with her interesting interpretation of Patsy (an abused slave) which is exemplary. It is only fair to also mention that Paul Dano and Benedict Cumberbatch both act vigorously in their roles. <br/><br/>Other details of the film are designed to perfection, including the costumes, sets and the aspects of slavery. Composed by Hanz Zimmer (and including work from John Legend and Alicia Keys) the ""12 Years a Slave"" soundtrack is powerful, but unfortunately not Zimmer's best work. <br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>A genuine classic that may appal some viewers, or teach others of a time when it was perfectly acceptable to exploit ethnic minorities. A requisite piece of cinema. <br/><br/>10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Written by Scott Gentry."

","12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) **** Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Brad Pitt, Garrett Dillahunt, Michael K. Williams,  Kelsey Scott, Quvenzhane Wallis, Cameron Zeigler, Scoot McNairy, Christopher Berry, Bill Camp, Devyn A. Tyler, Willo Jean-Baptiste. Remarkable true- life account of slavery in America based on the biography of freeman African-American Solomon Northup (Ejiofor in an incredible performance that is truly Oscar-worthy), who is tricked and abducted while on a trip from New York to Washington and sold into slavery against his will where he burdens many hardships in his long journey into hell. John Ridley's powerful adaptation of Northup's book is a surprisingly clear-eyed, warts-and-all blinding depiction of how history can be a personal gauntlet in spite of the tremendous odds against surviving. Filmmaker Steve McQueen uses all the archetypes of the Southern 'hospitality' usually seen in the genre of a Civil War treatise but doesn't flinch at all in the underpinnings of what is a true blight of humanity. Equally powerful in their acting (and award noticing) are Fassbender as Solomon's cruelest master with nothing but pure hatred broiling at the surface and a heartbreaking stoic turn by newcomer Nyong'o as the 'personal' slave he terrorizes to no end. One of the year's very best films."

","""I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportunity""  For her crime of fetching a bar of soap in order to rid herself of her  own unbearable stench, a young slave girl by the name of Patsey (Lupita  Nyong'o) is secured to a wooden post and relentlessly whipped by a  ruthless plantation owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Combine  this with an earlier scene in where the camera lingers in a torturous  long take over Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), as his back is  brutally savaged by assorted instruments, we know that Steve McQueen's  12 Years A Slave will not be an easy watch. As Patsey receives her  unjust punishment, Sean Bobbitt's unflinching camera captures the act  of cruelty and all its agony. The girl's skin peels of her back as the  whip tears through her flesh, exposing the blood and bone beneath. With  every anger-filled lash, you cringe deeper into your seat, sheltered in  an auditorium that has suddenly become rather chilly.  The year is 1841. Based on a true story, this historical period-drama  sees Solomon's life as a free family man stolen from under him when he  is kidnapped and sold as a slave, first to the benevolent Ford  (Benedict Cumberbatch) and then to the less-humane Epps. Throughout his  journey from Saratoga, New York to a plantation in Louisiana, Solomon  (slave name Platt) must keep his true identity and talents a secret if  he hopes to survive; ""I don't want to survive. I want to live"", says  Solomon and with every day that goes past, his chances of freedom grow  increasingly unlikely.  In response to the inevitable comparisons to Quentin Tarrantino's  Django Unchained, McQueen's masterpiece proudly tackles the  long-untouchable subject of slavery in its own way; ""Either we were  going to make a film about slavery or we weren't  and we chose to make  a film about slavery"" says McQueen during the London Film Festival,  ""making a slavery movie without violence would be like making a World  War II movie without shooting anyone."" If the pulpster's cartoonish  Django Unchained were to be considered little more than an appetiser to  slavery, then the raw and difficult 12 Years A Slave is very much the  main course and what a taste it leaves.  As Michael Fassbender's illustrious career screams for an Academy  Award, up steps McQueen  given that this is their third collaboration,  with Hunger and Shame both drawing Oscar blanks, 12 Years A Slave puts  the duo on track for third time lucky. The Fass's rendition of slaver  Epps A.K.A the ""nigger-breaker"", whose mood is lightened whenever he  delivers punishment to his ""property"", is truly remarkable and matches,  if not surpasses DiCaprio's exceptional turn as Django's Calvin Candie.  Ejiofor, our lead, graces us with a powerhouse performance as a broken  man whose eyes know nothing but pain. His formidable rendition of a  wrongfully enslaved man (not to say that any form is slavery is right)  claws at our heartstrings with as much mercy as the winter shows its  wildlife.  Where the cinematography could be described as beautiful in the  inspired way it allows the action to unfold, it feels very wrong to  attach such an adjective to a film with visuals that are actually quite  detrimental to one's peace of mind. Nonetheless, the creative  camera-work encourages Slave's cinematic scope and as it lingers in  close-up over the many lost faces, on some level this helps to restore  their identities; we're given time to remember who they are.  The title hints towards an inevitable conclusion, but nevertheless,  this is a fantastic feature that confirms McQueen's directorial  prowess See you at the Oscars. As the credits role and the auditorium  falls into darkness, nobody moves. Silent. Mesmerised."
"DarthVoorhees","10","7","12","12 March 2014"," The movie we needed...
","'12 Years a Slave' is a hard film to assess and watch. I think I like what it represents as a piece about Hollywood almost more than the film it's self (don't take me the wrong way. The film is excellent). I recall seeing 'Django Unchained' last year and sadly thinking that Tarantino's cartoony spaghetti western with all it's eccentricities still probably portrayed slavery more accurately than any Hollywood film had up until that point. Along comes '12 Years a Slave' less than a year later and as I watched the film I couldn't stop thinking that this was what was needed. I've come to find that the Academy Award for Best Picture has nothing to do with a film's worth but I will say that this film deserved a Best Picture award to find an even broader audience. Steve McQueen and Chiwetel Ejiofor in one feel swoop have made a film together that so brutally destroys the myth of American exceptionalism. '12 Years a Slave' is much like the much heralded 'Schindler's List' in it's blunt depiction of historical evil but McQueen has no time or respect for Spielbergian catharsis. '12 Years a Slave' is a brutal and honest.<br/><br/>This is not a film for the faint of heart. It is above everything else a passion play about psychical and mental torture. Our star Chiwetel Eijofor is asked to give the bravest and deepest of performances. His ability to suffer so realistically on the camera is hard to watch. We empathize with Solomon because Eijofor instills within him a great deal of intelligence and dignity. I think this is why the character and performance resonate so well with the theme of the film. Eijofor 's body takes punishment in horrendously violent scenes but it is the scenes of mental torture which are almost more angering. To see Northup being talked down to and berated as a stupid animal is horrible. McQueen and Eijofor take time to show Northup before he comes to his tragic fate. There's a great scene in the middle of the film that delves into the idea of being a slave and being a free black man. Northup is horrified to see his fellow slaves being restricted in their mental growth. Northup wants to regain the dignity a slave can never have. Eijofor's intelligence and audacity are perfect for this characterization.<br/><br/>McQueen is a brave storyteller. I love the fact that against this horrible backdrop is the constant use of the bible and Christianity as a justification for slavery. Michael Fassbender's Epps and even Benedict Cumberbatch's Ford both preach to their slaves as if to justify everything they do. I love this theme because it is completely against any depiction of slavery we have ever seen in a mainstream film. I don't think I've seen a film as anti-religious as '12 Years a Slave'. McQueen actually has the nerve to have a character hope that the Egyptian plaques pale in comparison to whatever happens to the plantation owners upon their judgement. This is brave. I think it's telling that this movie was made by a British director and a cast of English actors. I don't think '12 Years a Slave' could have been made in America by a major studio. The film believes mankind is inherently evil despite facades of being Christian or American. There is no justification for slavery other than a complete moral bankruptcy. <br/><br/>If this film were made in America by a Spielberg I imagine there would be some sort of catharsis or hope for a better tomorrow by having Soloman survive. McQueen ends the film with Soloman broken and carrying scars that will never heal. This is the only way to honestly portray slavery everything else is a romantic view of this nation's Holocaust."

","I am a southerner and when I watch movies depicting slavery, I am usually suspect. Most films depict Southern plantation owners as evil, cruel, despicable individuals. What I liked about the film, was the fact that it showed the political insanity of slavery, and those who owned slaves as the people they were. Some evil, some defective and some indifferent, and some, just trying to run a business. Notwithstanding the evils of slavery, in some cases the owners knew the horrors of slavery, yet the system was set up by a national government indifferent to the horrors of such evilness. How the lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofore did not receive the academy award, shocks me. The entire movie showed a character who persevered in circumstances inconceivable to most. The story line was straightforward, and since I will not write a spoiler, I am happy to say that the facts of the story appear to be told without undue political banter. I think it is the best movie ever made, and God knows I think Matt McConeghy is adorable, and Dallas Buyers club outstanding, it was a tie for Best Actor in my mind. If you have any time, read the book, 12 Years a Slave. This is a part of history that should never be forgotten, and hopefully all will gain insight of the complications and absurdity of slavery in the 1800's."
"mpecinam","4","7","12","24 February 2014"," Evoked no emotion
","12 years a slave versus Life is Beautiful (1997.)<br/><br/>NO SPOILERS for 12YAS, but some for LIB (it's an old movie so cope)<br/><br/>I can't say that I'm disappointed, though it was far from an enjoyable experience. I get the Oscar nominations, really I do. The acting was superb, especially by the male lead (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and one can never complain upon seeing a bit of Benedict Cumberbatch. Yet, the movie itself is absolute torture. Whipping, yelling something along the lines of how blacks are worthless, whipping, hangings, more whipping, etc. Yet in spite all this tragedy and suffering, the film was not at all moving. It just makes you cringe. So let's take Life is Beautiful by Roberto Benigni. The story is somewhat similar. In LiB, a man named Guido (a Jew) who is a rather charming character is madly in love with his wife and runs a bookshop somewhere in Italy with the help of his adorable son, Giosue. Then bam, Holocaust. Guido and Giosue are taken to a concentration camp. Once free men, they are now living in inhumane conditions and treated like filth. And yet, that film keeps a lightness to itself that 12YaAS certainly does not, and you can be sure that there is plenty of tragedy in both. We know a lot about Guido's wife and son, how they met even, and I won't believe anyone who says that they watched LiB without feeling concern for the characters. But of Solomon Northup we know almost nothing. We know that his wife is a cook and his children's names, but not much more. And that is why no one in the audience cares about Solomon. Where Benigni managed to infuse some charm into a story of great suffering, McQueen only shoots at us with more and more atrocities in form of violence in hope that it will evoke emotion. For me it did not. While the actor portrays the distress someone in that situation would be masterfully, I felt like Solomon just spends the movie making faces of desperation and half crying. I honestly would not have minded if the movie went on for another half hour if that meant us getting to know Solomon and his life a little bit better, which would certainly contribute depth both to the story and the character."

","""12 Years a Slave"" is an extremely touching and strong film in most aspects. <br/><br/>Quality is there in every scene and the feeling that you are actually in the times of slavery never leaves you during the whole story. Those, who think that Django Unchained had it all, prepare for a drama and much more brutal reality of those times. Colourful with violence and abuse, it is one of those movies when antagonists do not get any physical or emotional punishment for their sins, nor the enslaved ones get to the point of so desired by the viewer nemesis, just like it was historically.<br/><br/>There is no happy ending. Bitter of injustice does not abandon you with the redemption of the hero. Meant to be the most beautiful time of his life seeing kids grow, he spent being abused, beaten to his knees. The unique mix of class acting, intriguing plot and right focus on the reality of those times make the picture my personal top pick in 2013. Contribution of Michael Fassbender as the main villain deserves particular compliment."

","I first heard about this film when reading about the upcoming Oscar nominations, so falling victim to the massive hype the film was receiving, went to see it. The films starts off interestingly enough, a black man and his family seemingly living a middle class existence in New York in the 1840's (I'm sure plenty of us thought all blacks were still slaves at that time in America). Our hero plays the fiddle for a living and is kidnapped by unscrupulous showman who trick him into performing in Washington DC, and sell him to slave traders who ship him to Georgia. By now he has gone through the usual 'Roots' rites of passage stuff, and is quickly sold off to a number of slave masters, good and bad. As the film drags on to the end, all the same clichés appear until his friend from New York shows up to free him from a nasty slave owner. After the film finished I could not help thinking this was not a big screen epic, more of a Fox TV movie, it was cheap, the characters had no depth and the plot was simple and stretched out, it never made me want to read the original narrative, and is a very poor relation to other much more cinematic films, such as the excellent 'Amistad'. The message of the film speaks volumes about the film makers, ""lets use a slave story and we can reap the awards"" (just as Holocaust film makers use the same tactic). Don't waste your money, you will be bored to tears by this film which at best, should be on at 3pm on a weekday afternoon."
"Kicino","9","6","10","3 March 2014"," A Painful History to Come to Terms with
","Congratulations to 12 Years a Slave on winning the Oscar Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress in the Oscar. The movie is based on a tragic true story of Solomon Northup, a free man who was kidnapped and enslaved in the deep south of America before the Civil War. While we rejoice at the achievement of this production, we should not forget the agony millions of slaves suffered while building America.<br/><br/>This is a very difficult and disturbing movie to watch because of the slow tempo depicting the heavy and ugly reality that actually happened more than a century ago. All the torture, helplessness, abuse, and betrayal caused a minor headache. The last movie I felt so upset but had to finish watching was Schindler's List. There were so many moments that I wanted to just leave the theater.<br/><br/>But I also want to stay and see what happened. I know Northup's (Chiwetel Ejiofor) ordeal would end and I want to find out how he sticks it out and return to freedom. The film opens with his determination to reach out to the outside world – by boiling fruit juice to make ink to write on a precious piece of paper. But it is not until the latter half of the movie that this scene reappears. By then he has almost spent 12 years as a slave in a plantation under a mad couple who routinely abused their slaves.<br/><br/>Solomon Northup's misfortune started in 1841 when the talented violinist was invited to perform at a circus in Washington DC. He drank with his acquaintance and got really drunk. But the time he woke up, he was chained up and locked in a cell where the Capitol was seen. He and other black people were herded on a boat, shipped along the Red River to the south, stripped and sold like a cattle. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, we witness how threatening life can be to a slave, whether they work in the sugar cane field or cotton field. It is no Gone with the Wind, and definitely not Unchained Django. As meticulous described in Solomon Northup's memoir, slaves work day in and day out without knowing what will happen to them in the next minute: they can be physically or sexually abused or be sold to other monstrous plantation owners anytime. They are treated as property which can be freely sold. It seems to be a massive psychotic society where slaves were not respected at all. Being illiterate and without knowledge of the outside world, many just put their head down to survive. Some, like our heroine Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o who won the Best Supporting Actress for this role), do not even want to survive but also lack the courage to end their own life. <br/><br/>Yet in this hopeless and helpless situation, Solomon does not only want to survive, ""I want to live."" He exhibits enormous determination to leave this situation and return to his family in the north. He never loses hope despite failures and threats around him. He fights back. He attempts to escape. He asks a white slave for help only to find out he is betrayed: he tries all he can to return to freedom.<br/><br/>Since Solomon is literate, he can articulate and record his mundane and tortured life on the plantation after he regains his freedom. Think of all the other unheard and unrecorded horror stories. Award winning script writer John Ridley based his script, many lines verbatim, on Northup's memoir. Armed with this capturing script by John Ridley, director Steve McQueen gathers an excellent ensemble of cast to relive this unflattering history and forces us to reflect on what we have done to our fellow human beings and how noble some people are despite the cruel circumstances. <br/><br/>The sound effects, or the lack of it, is haunting as we witness the slaves' hardship: when Solomon was hanged on a tree, tiptoeing the mud right beneath him under the boiling sun; when Patsey was whipped by Northup, we only hear the whip wheezing and her screaming. According to Northup's memoir, when his master Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) took over the whip, he hit 10 times harder than Northup himself. That prolonged scene is tormenting to watch and provoke you to wonder how can a person do this to another. She, a hardworking woman who yields more cotton than the men, is already abused sexually in addition to being the source of jealousy from Mistress Epps (Sarah Epps). <br/><br/>This abuse of power reminds me of the Stanford Prison Experiment initiated by Dr Philip Zimbardo in the 1970s. Once university students were assigned a powerful role they did horrible things to the prisoners. That experiment was aborted after only six days but slavery went on for decades in the US. <br/><br/>Although the Declaration of Independence was adopted in 1776 which states that ""All men are created equal,"" there were slave trade in even the capital! America is such a hypocrite society. <br/><br/>It is sad that Solomon's persecution against his abductors did not materialize and his last days were unknown. African Americans has come a long way, from slaves to the civil war to Rosa Parks. They built America but their effort was not commemorated and it was not until Martin Luther King then they are more equal and finally there is Barack Obama. This movie would mean so much to the American society. Very serious and very heavy but so brutally real. <br/><br/>More stories like this should be told. Not just the glamorous Gone with the Wind, heroic Django Unchained, and the entertaining Butler. It is high time we face our past. For without know the past, we would never understand how and where we would go forward. A must watch for those who care for humanity."

You will be be thrown in the middle of a bleak story of violence and hopefully condemn any form of racism and understand how evil have been white men, at that time in that place. No questions the movie is well done, with beautiful scenarios, very good acting, a good script, etc... but at points I wondered why should one keep watching this kind of violent and depressing stories (is it for people who ignore such things happened? then I would say its target should be schools and young children, but this is definitely not a movie addressed to them). I cannot agree with reviews saying this is a masterpiece, as I cannot find particular reasons for that. Where is innovation, creativity, poetry? A good movie it is, but mainly due to the fact it rediscovers the story of an otherwise forgotten hero. Personally I would have probably enjoyed it more if the movie kept telling the story of its hero in his fight for justice over his white masters and against slavery (for his contribution over a wider problem). Ultimately I believe this might be the reason why the main character should not be forgotten today and can be seen as a hero: for his contribution in fighting for an equal world. But this is only quickly written in the end titles. The movie is mainly a ride across violence and despair. Not the main reason I enjoy to watch movies."
"bob-the-movie-man","9","6","10","13 January 2014"," A Powerhouse of a British movie with great direction, DP and performances
","I love this time of year in the run up to the Oscars – - the real power-house films are coming to the fore. 12 Years a Slave is a case in point: a hard film to watch, but ultimately a must see.<br/><br/>The film tells the true story of Solomon Northup living life as a gentleman in Saratoga, New York at a time when the divide between the Northern and Southern states on colour was never wider. Tricked and kidnapped, he is cruelly stripped of his fine clothes, his dignity and his freedom and shipped south to a life of servitude at the hands of a variety of 'owners' , all of them supposedly a'God-fearing Christians, but some distinctly more Christian that others.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot (by DP of Photography Sean Bobbitt) with long lingering panoramas of bayous and vistas contrasting the beauty and quiet of the landscape with the ugliness and brutality of the plantations. In fact, this film is bound to feature strongly in all of the nominations in the technical categories at the forthcoming awards: lighting, wardrobe, editing all magnificent. And the special effects used in one particularly uncomfortable scene are truly impressive: sometimes you don't need to be in a galaxy far far away to appreciate the subtle arts of a special effect.<br/><br/>Londoner Steve McQueen directs with true flair. Some of the shots are long, langourous and without dialogue, letting the audience inside the head of the actor to the point where you want them to cut away because it is becoming too painful to carry on watching. True directorial power. He is certainly not afraid to continue to tackle controversial material head-on, given that this is his follow-on film from sex-addiction film ""Shame"". (For female fans it is worth pointing out that there is one shot in particular – in which he wears loose fitting pantaloons – where Michael Fassbender reveals – ahem – the length to which he went in that earlier film).<br/><br/>In the acting department – as for American Hustle – this deserves an award for the ensemble cast who work together splendidly. The big names – Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti and Brad Pitt – all perform admirably for the limited time they are on screen. Giamatti in particular (who impressed in his role as the driver in ""Saving Mr Banks"") is particularly chilling as the inappropriately named Freeman, selling on the kidnapped slaves to new owners: a portrait of urbane callousness.<br/><br/>But it is the sparring between London-born star Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender, as the evil cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps, that really make the acting sparks fly. It would be no surprise if both actors were Oscar nominated, and indeed a surprise if they were not. Both are outstanding. Interestingly Ejiofor made his film breakthrough in another slavery film, Steven Spielberg's Amistad, before going onto greater things (sarcasm) in Richard Curtis's Love Actually.<br/><br/>Also notable is Lupito N'yongo who – astonishingly – makes her acting debut in the role of Patsey, the beautiful but abused love interest of Fassbender's Epps. Finally, acting herself firmly into the category of ""most despised female of the year so far"" is Sarah Paulson as Epps wife, vindictively taking her marital ire out on Patsey. In Django Unchained I was critical of the way in which the plantation owner's wife Mrs Candie – who seemed to be, if not good, not fundamentally evil either – got cruelly, albeit comically, dispatched at the end of the film. No such reservations if Django wants to pay Mistress Epps a visit! My one and only criticism of this amazing film is the music score. I thought a recurring theme sounded startlingly similar to a theme from ""Inception"" and I found myself thinking ""whoever wrote this must be a fan of Hans Zimmer"". Then as the credits rolled, I saw the score was written by. Hans Zimmer. A quick google of the two films' titles reveals that my observation hasn't gone unnoticed by others. A bit of an irritating distraction for me.<br/><br/>Many years ago Spielberg's ""Colour Purple"" made a big impression, both with audiences and at the awards. This wonderful albeit gruelling film deserves to do likewise: it is the Colour Purple of 2014. It is a sad and astonishing fact that more than 150 years after this film was set, a minority of our 'civilised' society still judge a person by the colour of their skin. As such, and in the same way as Schindler's List was used as an educational tool, this film could and should be shown in schools as a weapon in the fight against racism."

I have seen great actors acting a role and I have to say, Ejiofor doesn't even come close.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***The scene when he finds himself in shackles: he couldn't act like he was actually a captured individual, about to be sold into slavery. This guy looked like a 2013 man paid to pretend to be a captured slave. That's not authenticity.<br/><br/>Also, why was he made to appear as if he was a passive observer in his story? What's up with that McQueen? He looked like he was just standing by while things went on with other people. Go home and watch There Will Be Blood and tell me if Daniel Day-Lewis' character was a passive observer. <br/><br/>Also, was there any character study done? Because if they say there was, I wouldn't believe it. Watching it, I could tell it was a movie. Good movies look so real that you can't tell it's a movie. Perfect example of a slave movie that looks real, Goodbye Uncle Tom. Go watch it now and compare it to 12 Years a Slave. Hell, even watch Django Unchained and compare it to this one and you'll say Django is better.<br/><br/>Which brings me to white people. White people probably gave this movie great reviews because it was so tame. I bet when they heard that another slavery movie was being released, they shook in their seats at huffington post or san francisco chronicle. I bet they thought this movie was going to expose all the wrongs of slavery in a way that makes Django Unchained look like Mickey Mouse. Well, it didn't.<br/><br/>All the bad things about slavery are hidden in this movie. **Spoiler** The rape scene looks more like a sex scene. The hanged people are unseen. And torture is so weak. True, they show whippings, but that was the least of it during slavery. They hid too much from us in this movie and that's why white people loved such a mediocre movie.<br/><br/>If you like a nice, tame movie which doesn't even put the main character at the forefront of the plot, you'll love 12 Years a Slave. If you're a movie enthusiast who loves a deep, emotionally challenging picture like Boys Don't Cry or Monster or more recently Fruitvale Station, then you'll hate this movie."

Chiwetel Ejiofor's acting was nothing special; I got tired of his perpetually pained expression filling the screen. Why didn't he age or grow thinner? Did they have to portray all slave owners as sadistic? And that final scene was so painfully stiff and staged it seemed as though the director and screen writer just ran out of energy.

He has a loving family of a wife and two children, and he has a mastery of the violin, which he is admired for locally. He is respected, and in turn, he respects.

He is told that he is a runaway slave from Georgia. His personally narrative has been erased illegally. From the slave marketplace, as though humans were cars or horses, he is purchased by William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a man deemed as ""good"". In truth, everyone involved in the slave trade had murky characters. However, to call slavers good, is a big stretch. Ford is called a ""good"" man because he does not believe in whipping or torturing his slaves; although, he employs unknowingly those that do believe in such mistreatment. Master Ford is wounded morally by his participation (including his agreement in separating a mother from her children) as it takes its toll on him.<br/><br/>After a major event on Ford's plantation, ""Platt"" finds himself sold to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a man of evil fortitude. Epps is a morally corrupt man that enjoys ""nigger breaking"" and other means of cruelty. He is renown for his character. Out of the frying pan and into the fire goes ""Platt"". It doesn't take long to see why Epps has earned his infamy. In his corner is his wife, Mary (Sarah Paulson). She is close to matching the cruelty of her husband, fueled by the jealousy of her husband's obsession with Patsy, a young slave woman, on the plantation. Unlike ""Platt"", Patsy's resilience is next to nothing. She is raped, overworked, and, in a fateful scene, whipped to an inch of her life.<br/><br/>Throughout his years at Epps plantation, he sees continuously the various means of survival in this cruel system. He meets Mrs. Shaw (Alfre Woodard), a former slave turned companion for Mr. Shaw, a slaver. Their arrangement is a rare one. She ignores his amorous advances toward slave women, and in turn, she never feels the hard work of the plantation again.<br/><br/>Through a chance meeting with a Canadian carpenter, Bass (Brad Pitt), ""Platt"" becomes Solomon Northup and regains his freedom, while returning to his life and a new path into abolition.<br/><br/>As a viewer, I was gut punched. I shed tears. I could not turn away without feeling an inch of the devastation that the slave economy brought to the United States. It's one of America's unforgiven sins, and to see it on scene without the sugarcoating and far easier portrayals of past movies exploring slavery, is one that should be experienced.<br/><br/>There are some detractors that do not want to see the film succeeded because they prefer the past left alone. However, director Steve McQueen and writer John Ridley takes us on an uncomfortable journey that is required to see how the past has not been forgotten, but continues to shape our present and, hopefully, not our future.<br/><br/>Go see it."

","And the Oscar for best picture goes to... 12 Years a Slave, and it was deserved! Sure, it had a lot of good competition, but in my view it was the right choice.<br/><br/>This is a strong theme, and lately there are other movies about slavery, but if you want to see one of the best in the genre, this is the one. A movie based on a true story about the memoirs of Solomon Northup, and how he was abducted and sold into slavery, for 12 years in his life, hence the title.<br/><br/>We begin the movie seeing Solomon and his family, for now he's still a free man, but things are about to change. Two men tricked him, and he's sold into slavery. From now on, he'll have to live working for slave-owners. The story develops from here until he's finally free, after 12 years (obviously predictable, so not a spoiler).<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely fantastic: Chiwetel Ejiofor - main role interpreted beautifully. Benedict Cumberbatch - brief moment in the movie, played the role of the ""fair"" slave-owner. Michael Fassbender - he should have won the Oscar, he delivered a spectacular performance. Lupita Nyong'o - now a Oscar-winner, and doing a very good job. Brad Pitt - even for brief moments, but with a determinant role.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning, the music, despite being a little repetitive enters in the right moments building up the movie's atmosphere (Music by Hans Zimmer). The narrative is built from the book, it's well-structured, and developed in an easy way to understand it.<br/><br/>You may need to have a strong stomach at some points because the violence is present and it's a very visual and also emotional experience."

","From ""acclaimed director of challenging films"" Steve McQueen comes the tale of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery, and the titular 12 years of torment he subsequently endured. <br/><br/>The story survived in the form of a sometimes chillingly proper and polite autobiography that leaves a lot to the imagination. A perfect a fit as McQueen could hope for, given his short but powerful track-record of conveying a lot through an almost minimalist approach to filmmaking. His is an unflinching, yet often graceful eye (rather than the perversely voyeuristic poking of, say, Von Trier), so you'd be forgiven for at first staying clear of this film with the apprehension that it might be unbearable to endure. Slavery-film fatigue would be an understandable first reaction. And yet<br/><br/>It's probably safe to say that few things can prepare you for this film, but not in the ways you'd fear. Being the product of a mostly non-American cast and a black, non-American director frees it of any handicapping guilt, and allows 12 Years A Slave to use slavery not as an end in itself, but mere legal context to the tolerance of cruelty. The very nature of the plot helps in this regard too, and in retrospect one of the most chilling aspects of the story is that so many characters are outraged by protagonist Solomon's plight not because he is a human being entitled to dignity, but because he is ""illegally acquired"". With the exception of Brad Pitt's slightly distracting cameo, the same noble whites who would save Solomon do not spare a second glance at his fellow slaves, the latter born into their condition. On the intellectual plane, the film gives us something new. That is not to say that it isn't brutal, it is. Often viscerally so.<br/><br/>While it's fair to say that on paper at least, the film presents one of the most genuine meditations on the subject of abusive servitude ever passed off as entertainment. That leaves us with execution, and this is where things arguably become even more impressive.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen was reportedly cheered at the Director's Guild Awards when, in response to a question, he said he shot the whole film in little over a month, with only one camera. Take it how you will, there is no denying the man's virtuoso levels of economy, each of the many extended shots stretched to unnerving lengths: for all the technical prowess of some of the choreography, in a year where Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity threw us through space in 3D for 14 minutes with no cut in sight, the most memorable shot of 2013 was an unbearable wide shot of Solomon hanged to a tree, gasping for air, toes barely touching the ground, for what feels like an eternity.<br/><br/>And if his technical mastery of his craft is at this point beyond question, his coaching of his cast more than rises to the occasion. It's a career-landmark role for Chiwetel Ejiofor, for obvious reasons, but as a mostly reactive protagonist he is at the mercy of his co-stars. Thank God for Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender. The former earns the golden statuette the hard way, while the later throws everything he has into one of the vilest creatures ever to grace the screen. There are other, dependable known faces in the mix: Benedict Cumberbatch (a ubiquitous institution these days it seems), Paul Giamatti and Alfre Woodard. Of the supporting cast Paul Dano and Sarah Paulson provide an extra edge. The only bum note is Brad Pitt's too-progressive-to-be-true foreign contractor, robbing the film of perfection by a narrow margin. The role might be pure investor gratitude, but then one must face the fact that without Pitt's initial backing the film as a whole might never have seen the light of day. <br/><br/>Looking through the message boards, there's a lot of dialogue about the film from many who have not seen it, and are either hesitant or downright hostile to it. To the latter category, who often ask ""why do we need to see this"", I would say the following: beyond the fresh elements it brings to an old issue, it remains a film, and as such, it is a masterclass in direction, in storytelling economy, and in pure tension. <br/><br/>Damn right you need to see this."

He decides that co-operation is the best way to survive. <br/><br/>He sees few others in the same situation as him, but slowly he is separated from those with who he has built support. This process continues over his life as a slave, as he is at the mercy of whoever his master at the time and his master's associates who work on their own priorities. <br/><br/>But he finds that co-operation generally gets one nowhere and sometimes can get one into further trouble due to jealousy.....<br/><br/>Its a hat trick for McQueen as he has crafted another near perfect film, and has gotten some career best performances from many involved, especially Ejiofor, who is wonderful as Soloman. <br/><br/>The film follows the three act rule of thumb, but when watching this, you cannot help but think that its a film of two halves. The first part the incarceration, and coming to terms, but having a fair owner, played brilliantly by Cumberbatch.<br/><br/>The second part is almost the desperation part of the story, with Soloman becoming desperate, and coming face to face with pure evil, turning his life as a slave into something else. Fassbender is wonderful here, oozing pure menace i to every act he does, whether its dancing, or just sitting there relaxing.<br/><br/>Cinematography is wonderful, and some drawn out scenes, like Soloman hanging, are beautifully sinister.<br/><br/>If there is a better film released this year, film-goers are in for a treat.<br/><br/>A masterpiece on every level."
"Kingslaay","Null","3","4","23 April 2017"," A Powerful film experience
","12 Years a Slave is a shocking and brutal look at slavery and the reality for many during those horrible times. It does shy away from the harsh realities of slave life and viewer does not get a veiled look of their lives. It is this journey and story of Solomon Northup that makes this a beautiful film. Without warning a respectable and free man is taken away from his family to the inhumane life of slavery. Harsh truths of life during those times are shown at a nonstop pace. It is also interesting to note the disparities that existed within a country from free states to slave states. On some level viewers might even relate to Solomon's plight. What if one of us was displaced from our comfy lives and put in an unknown and foreign place where people didn't care about laws and men? <br/><br/>The performances are simply first class. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o give award worthy performances and belt it out to the back row. You feel their frustration, fear, anger and other emotions. This film is also beautifully directed and has a masterful soundtrack to accompany it. Steve McQueen manages to immerse his viewers in the lives of slaves and slave owners in those times. We are captivated by the beautiful storytelling, direction and cinematography. <br/><br/>This film is not something you can watch over and over as it is a powerful dose. Despite being an incredible film it is not easy to re-watch just like it was not easy to re-watch Schindler's list. 12 Years a Slave has to be one of the greatest films ever made and is truly a cinematic experience. It definitely earned its best picture Oscar. <br/><br/>Definitely recommended if you want a thought provoking and moving experience, 9/10"

I applaud the acting from most of the cast and appreciate that Pitt and McQueen would have had a hard job convincing actors to participate in this film.

","After watching 12 Years a Slave with my family, we all agreed that this film is a must see for any American. While it is awfully sad and hard to watch at times, it is rightfully so. As George Santayana once said,""Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it."" It's important for people to understand that slavery is part of our American history or else we may be doomed to repeat such atrocities. This movie transcends time and is able to bring the viewer back to a time and place that most history text books would like to skip over. Part way through the movie I even realized that I was instinctively scared when a white person showed up on screen. This is the kind of experience everyone needs to even begin to understand what antebellum America may have been like for a slave."

Just sitting through a little over than 2 hours and watching this movie made my heart bleed, I can't even begin to think of the people who lived their entire lives as SLAVES... 12 years a slave heart breakingly makes you feel the pain and suffering of almost the entire human kind at one point of time or other.

","Twelve Years a Slave is an adaptation of the 1853 memoir of the same name by Solomon Northup, a New-York state born free Negro who was kidnapped in Washington D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for twelve years before his release. It is depressing, sad, annoying, frustrating to watch what Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) went through his 12 years as a slave. A great performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor whose act of bewilderment, despair, anguish, trying to survive is just outstanding. There are moments when with no sound and little movement, he projects what hopelessness looks like. His 12 years of unthinkable abuse, backbreaking labour, fading dreams of happy family, desperateness to figure a way out to his freedomevery act moves us. The brutality, dehumanizing acts of the masters make it so tough to even look at the screen.<br/><br/>Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) as a cotton plantation owner is shown as humane yet ineffectual who eventually sells Solomon to the vicious, drunken Epps (Michael Fassbender), another cotton plantation owner. Epps is ruthless. The screen timings with him in the frame are like an unbearable demonstration of misery in movement.<br/><br/>Another applauding performance has come from Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) who is vocal about her grief, a young slave, victim of Epps' barbarous and insane ways. She is raped and beaten by Epps, who is also a cause of envy to Epps' wife who feels that Epps has an eye on her.<br/><br/>I was actually moved by lot many scenes in the movie. Mother's pleading not to separate her from her two children, still all three being sold to different masters creates a lump in the throat. Solomon strung up by the neck for a transgression and his toes are barely touching the dark plantation mud as he dangles, near-dead under the scorching sun. Another disturbing visual is merged with this i.e. children are playing in the background, other slaves are going ahead with their chores since they fear that if they would help Solomon, they would lose their lives. Patsey somehow manages to give him little water. The psyche of the slaves, their surrendering to the fate one side and the heartless brutality of the masters / overseers on another side are very well captured. The night Patsey comes to Platt (Solomon's identity as a slave), asking him to kill her is a scene of unbearable pain, particularly as Platt turns his back and Patsey sobs into the night. Male / female slaves with their bleeding back after being beaten up (almost to death) choked me. Solomon just wanting to rush with officials who came to free him (following Bass -Brad Pitt's) efforts, turning back to give a warm hug to Patsey is so overwhelming. <br/><br/>It depicts the dark chapter of slavery in American History. It is beyond one's imagination the kind of suffering the slaves faced. A complete shame to humanity.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen as director is adept with his articulation. Though the title says that Solomon would be slave for 12 years, McQueen and John Riddley makes us feel that it could be forever. Sean Bobbit (Cinematographer) has given great aerial shots which are so effective in making us bewildered, disoriented, and a complete lost feel along with the protagonist.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave isn't easy to watch since it not only unfolds the tragedy of Solomon in particular but it also depicts the tragedy of such countless souls who lost the biggest gift of mankind- the freedom."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","4","28 February 2014"," English angle of American black slavery
","While black English director Steve McQueen can boast of a proliferation of ""shorts"", he has only made two feature movies prior to ""12 years"": ""Hunger"" (2008) an interpretation of the highly emotive events surrounding the 1981 IRA Hunger Strike and ""Shame"" (2011) a portray of a contemporary man living in New York with a predicament of inability to manage his liferelationships and sex in particular. Both have received acclaims for their artistic achievement. For his third feature, McQueen moves to American black slavery. On this heavy subject matter, the recent ""Django unchained"" (2012) by Quentin Tarantino is, well, very ""Tarantino"" i.e. a fairytale of dark humor achieving the impossible of making such a movie conventionally entertaining.<br/><br/>McQueen's own rendition is based on the titular true story about how a free black man, reasonably comfortable financially and socially (to the extent possible), was abducted, stripped of his true identity, and sold to be a slave. Details of the actual events over the 12 years, meticulously depicted in the movie, I see no point to recount. If I were to try, in no time at all I would have exhausted my limited supply of adjectives – atrocious, brutal, ruthless, cruel, painful, heartbreaking etc – and still fall far short of what is needed.<br/><br/>The opening scene, with ominous strings (especially the cello) in the background, shows Solomon Northup being lined up with other new arrivals at a plantation and lectured on the job of cutting sugar cane. The flashback, the real start of the story, delivers brisk narratives of his happy life with his family (wife and two kids) and his two-week assignment with a travelling circus as an entertainer utilizing his acclaimed skill at the violin. One shot has him enjoying a sumptuous dinner and champagne in celebration of a successful tour, while the next one abruptly cuts to his waking up in a dungeon in manacles. He is waking up, but it is where the true nightmare begins.<br/><br/>By the way, the spoken language used, sounding strange today, is intended to reflect the period from 1841 to 1853. For example, close to the end of the movie, after hearing the protagonist's sad story, the sympathetic listener (played by none other than Brad Pitt) comments: ""Your story is amazing, in a no-good way"".<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor is an actor that I have noticed 10 years ago, in Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"". He has since appeared in a number of major motion pictures in roles that progressively made him a familiar face to the audience. In ""12 years a slave"" he finally lands a role that is sufficiently compelling for an Oscar bid. He has already won BAFTA but with such a strong field in Oscar it is one exciting race. We will find out in less than two days.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is no less than stellar. In order of appearance, we have Paul Giamatti, a brief cameo role, as the slave trader who sells Northup to his first master. That one is played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who now needs no introduction. The character he portrays is a sympathetic plantation owner who, unfortunately because of his own financial plague, is unable to help Northup when the crunch comes. The villain is Paul Dano, directors' top choice for playing offbeat, neurotic, psychopathic and any of the other variations of weird personas. In this movie, it is a sadistic plantation supervisor whose passion is to put Northup through something worse than death.<br/><br/>What appears to be a rescue, being sent to a new owner, turns out to be the worst nightmare. Michael Fassbender is another character actor that needs no introduction. His portrayal of a fiendish plantation owner that performs evil acts while quoting the Scripture has won him a Best Supporting Oscar nomination. On the subject, while not in the stellar category, Lupita Nyong'o playing a fellow slave struggling under unspeakable suffering has won a supporting award in Critics' Choice and will be having her taste of Oscar competition.<br/><br/>The last, but certainly not least, stellar appearance I have already alluded to. Brad Bitt plays a Canadian contract constructor who was instrumental to carrying the message to ""the North"" that finally led to Northup's rescue. I acknowledge the joy of seeing Brad Pitt, but must say that in my mind, rather than seeing a character named ""Bass"" coming to deliver Northup from 12 years of hellish nightmare, I see BRAD PITT!"

It's like, oh hey, we got these A-listers in this movie, so it must be good right? Staying on the slavery theme, I really thought Amistad was much better than this was. And sorry to Lupita Nyong'o, but Oscar worthy performance? Didn't really seem like it being she was short on lines and screen time. Chiwetel Ejiofor as the lead was probably the only character in this entire movie that held my interest, but even his performance is dwarfed by Djimon Hounsou in Amistad. Was this the case of the Academy trying to make a statement again, such as it did with Halle Berry and Monster's Ball?"
"lee_eisenberg","10","4","6","20 April 2014"," nothing can show us the full brutality of slavery, but this comes close
","Solomon Northup's story of his kidnapping and sale into slavery got widely read upon its original publication but then disappeared as the Confederates built up an idealized image of the antebellum south (exemplified in ""Gone with the Wind""). Now that Northup's story has gotten brought to the screen, it's important for everyone to see it. ""12 Years a Slave"" not only takes an uncompromising look at the sheer brutality of slavery, but also shows how nothing could take away Northup's dignity and his hope that he would one day be a free man again. One of the ugliest scenes is the whipping of a slave for perceived disobedience.<br/><br/>Most of the credit goes to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup, showing him to be a man who wouldn't let even the most vicious treatment break him. The rest of the cast deserves ample kudos, but Steve McQueen deserves credit for bringing to the screen a story that got suppressed for over a century.<br/><br/>This movie should also motivate us all to take a serious look at the plantation system and the fact that the US economy got built on it. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, and the White House is the product of slave labor.<br/><br/>In the end, this definitely deserved Best Picture. Three quarters of a century after the pro-Confederate ""Gone with the End"" won big, we are finally seeing atonement. If you see only one movie this year, make it ""12 Years a Slave""."

To see a man kidnapped from his family and placed in slavery, a woman separated from her children all suffering such abuse. If movies are designed to elicit powerful emotions through their portrayal then this succeeded with me.<br/><br/>I know slavery has existed for a long-time, Greeks had slaves, Romans took slaves from Europe including northern Europeans. The most famous slave in history is perhaps Spartacus, who fought for his freedom against the Romans. Yet this portrayal set during pre civil war America once again highlights the incredible evils that society can allow itself to accept and consider normal, enforceable, lawful.<br/><br/>The sense of sadness I felt whilst watching this film, not just for Solomon but for all of the victims in this film, combined at times with rage and a desire to fight in defence of these trapped and fearful people.<br/><br/>Hopefully, despite this movie largely portraying white men and women in the role of oppressor, people will realise that racism and slavery have historically been colour blind with abuse against all races.

","Steve Mcqueen is proving himself to be a director to look out for. I wasn't a huge fan of his debut, Hunger, as I found it too pro-IRA and slow. However, I thought that the directing was pretty outstanding and it had a distinct style. Shame is a film I've yet to see, but I've heard plenty of rave reviews. 12 Years a Slave looks to be Mcqueen's masterpiece. It's film-making at it's most effective and powerful. I cam away from the film feeling incredibly moved as I sat there in silence along with the rest of the crowd as the credits came up. 12 Years a Slave dares to bare all in a way that most mainstream films would be afraid of doing. Mcqueen shows all the unflinching brutality to create an overwhelming sense of power. I'm used to watching harrowing and depressing films, but these are normally little known like, Dancer in the Dark and The Seventh Continent. 12 Years a Slave is very much mainstream, yet I still found it incredibly harrowing and brutal. Mainstream audiences are go to in for a nasty shock.<br/><br/>The film itself has the look of a classic. Like other modern masterpieces such as, There Will Be Blood and Black Swan, the film looks grainy and the cinematography is quite beautiful. You can almost feel the scorching sun dripping off the screen. The directing is near perfection. Mcqueen goes for an art house vibe without over doing it. He keeps the camera deathly still when filming most of the brutality, such as the unflinching whipping of Solomon near the beginning of the film. This distance adds an added emotional punch for the audience as we're forced to feel every lash on his back. Equally as uncomfortable is the scene where Solomon has been left to hang and we're forced to watch him trying to stand on his tip toes for what feels like an eternity.<br/><br/>Another impressive aspect of the film is the stellar performances. Chiwetel is hugely convincing in the lead as the wrongly enslaved Solomon Northup. We feel his pain as he's able to draw such emotion without even saying a word. Michael Fassbender is astounding as the evil plantation owner who treats his slaves as the vermin of the Earth. Fassbender manages to pull off a convincing deep south accent, although his Irish twang is very much still trying to come out. Lupita is also distressing to watch as the slave who has lost all hope, she especially impresses in the greatest scene of the film (more on that later). The supporting cast are all brilliant also. Paul Dano is deliciously evil and Benedict Cumberbatch offers a rare glimpse of humanity among the rich slave owners.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is a film not to enjoy, but to endure. Many people would fail to see the point in going to see a film which isn't entertaining in the slightest, but I'm not one of those people. I love films which are brave, powerful and deeply emotional. The story of Solomon is a grippingly harrowing one and Steve Mcqueen forces you to watch some disturbing, yet important scenes and directs with a shattering sense of realism. The stand-out moment in the film for me was the whipping of Patsey. This scene possesses so much power and it's enough to break your heart. Mcqueen directs the scene in one long take and the emotion of it all is almost too much to bear. The grisly effects make is all the more harrowing.<br/><br/>Another thing I loved about the film was the fantastic music. It's unsettling at times, whether it be the strange drum music on the slave boat or the haunting lyrics to Paul Dano's solo song. However, the main score is the most shattering and only served to elevate the raw emotion it portrays on the screen. It came as no surprise to see Hans Zimmer's name appear on the end credits as he is one of the greatest cinematic composers of all time in my opinion.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is not an easy film to watch, but it's an important one. If you don't feel deeply moved or depressed when it's finished, then you must be Edwin Epps. It's all the more tragic that this film is true and something like this happened for a long time. It could've very easily become sentimental in its last emotional scene, but Mcqueen made it feel real and removed all the Hollywood gloss to create much more of an impact. It won the best picture Oscar and deservedly so. I can't help but feel that it should've won more though and it's shocking to see that it wasn't even nominated for best cinematography. 12 Years a Slave is harrowing cinema at its very best. Even if you just see it once. Be sure to see it."

","""12 Years A Slave"" is a powerful picture on the challenging struggle of real-life free-slave Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and put back to the horrors of slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor's name will be pronounced numerous times during movie awards season for his riveting starring performance as Northrup. In fact, the whole movie was freed from lousy acting with other impressive performances; most notably from Michael Fassbender as the villainous slaveowner Edwin Epps, Sarah Paulson as his horror story-esque sister Mistress Epps, and Lupita Nyong'O as the tortured slave Patsey. Director Steve McQueen's work here will propel him to elite auteur status. But believe it or not, John Ridley's screenplay was a bit too detached for my taste. Nevertheless, break the chains and witness for yourself the gripping ""12 Years A Slave"". **** Excellent"

","You cannot help feel unmoved by this movie. The perpetual violence dulls the mind to the point that the story becomes boring and perhaps is mostly made up. Anyone with bad experiences will exaggerate those experiences, especially if it is for commercial gain. I came away from this movie unimpressed. We all know slavery is bad so why try and make us guilty of it. It belongs to a different era with different ideals that we cannot contemplate. So if this movie is meant to shock me or profound me then it has not. Far from it. Perhaps the movie should be about the real protagonists, those behind the buying and selling of slaves in USA. They were most definitely not of Christian faith as is always portrayed by Hollywood."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","11","23","30 November 2013"," Incredible Story with Brilliant Lead Performance
","12 Years a Slave (2013) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>A rather remarkable true story about Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free Northern black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery where he spends twelve years away from his family and living in some of the worst conditions imaginable. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a good to very good movie but I'm going to fall a little shy of calling it one of the year's best for a couple reasons. For starters, while the score itself is quite brilliant, with the film it just doesn't work. The score at times comes off way too over-dramatic and especially during the more shocking moments of the film where we see the slaves being beaten or worse. I personally feel that these scenes are so shocking and revolting on their own that there really wasn't a need for such an over-the-top and dramatic score to be blazing. Another problem I had is that there really wasn't a good flow to the picture or story as it just seemed like we were seeing vignettes put together to show various aspects of Northup's life. With that said, there's no question that Ejiofor delivers one of the year's greatest performance. I think the screenplay and story certainly give him a lot to work with but the actor does a marvelous job with it. There are so many different emotions to this character but the actor pulls them off remarkably. The character's whole thoughts on the slavery, how to react to certain situations and other obstacles are very much on display and it's terrific how Ejiofor is able to show the viewer how the character is thinking. The supporting cast has some major actors with Michael Fassbender doing a very good job at a rather evil slave owner. You've also got Lipita Nyong'o nearly stealing the film as Patsey, an abused slave. There's also Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt in smaller but memorable roles. Director Steve McQueen does a very good job at showing off the horrors of the slaves but I also liked some of the smaller scenes where we see Northup interacting with other slaves. There are some quiet moments scattered around the violence that are quite touching and bring a certain human touch to the various evils that we are seeing. While not perfect, 12 YEARS A SLAVE does tell a pretty remarkable story and it's worth seeing."

","12 Years A Slave is about a free black man named Solomon Northup, from upstate New York, who gets kidnapped and sold into slavery. The film follows the mans journey to survive and get back his freedom.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a film quite like this before. It's one that doesn't let back on the cruelty and torture that was brought upon slaves in the 1800′s. It's wasn't comfortable to watch at times, but that was the point. You aren't supposed to think slavery is a light topic. 12 Years A Slave is a film that will bring tears to your eyes. They aren't treated this way, but most of these slaves are innocent. Families torn apart to serve others and who get tortured when something wasn't done right or they look at their superiors the wrong way..<br/><br/>The performances were breathtaking. Chiwetel Ejiofor was just brilliant as Solomon Northup, a man who is fighting to survive and get back to his family. You can feel the mans heartbreak and fear just by his facial expressions. That's what makes a fantastic actor. Michael Fassbender, who plays a cruel plantation owner, was also very good. There wasn't a moment where you didn't hate him. Newcomer Lupita Nyong'o was also fantastic and Brad Pitt made his 5 minutes of screen time as powerful and meaningful as he could. He played a Canadian Carpenter who felt strongly about the topic of slavery, and who gives a great speech about his feelings late in the film. Pitt plays the more sensible type in the film, and his performance will bring you to tears when you feel a sense of relief knowing there's a character with a heart like his.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer has to be one of my favourite composers. His music can break your heart, get your adrenaline pumping or keep you smiling. His music added to the heartbreak of the film. When tears are rolling down your eyes, it's hard to stop from crying out loud when his score comes on. I don't usually comment on a soundtrack, but Hans Zimmer was a fantastic choice for this film.<br/><br/>The film length is perfect. I understand people can't sit through a 2 hour and 20 minute film, but with a film like this, it's great because of the impact the runtime has. You get to feel and see the pain that the slaves have. Needless to say, this film has taught me a lot about history, and how to treat people. To people who are looking for a light fun film, than 12 Years A Slave is not for you. Don't walk on thinking this is going to be all light and fluffy, because I can assure you, it's not for the light hearted. Slaves are being tortured and mistreated in the most brutal ways and you sometimes have to turn away or cover your eyes, but as I said, that's the impact the film is supposed to have on you.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I loved 12 Years A Slave. It was a film that is great for a History class to go and watch. It's a great topic of conversation and will make us think twice about the way we treat people. 12 Years A Slave is the film of the year, but I know, with a year ending soon and still a lot of Oscar films to come, there's still a lot to look forward to. You get a rare type of film every few years. A film that will win a deserving amount of Oscars or will make you want to scream when they don't. This film is that film.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"cheesustoast","2","7","13","15 August 2014"," 2 hours of pointless and depressing oppression for what?
","How this movie has got such a high rating is beyond me! I just need to ask: what is the point in this movie? What is it supposed to prove?<br/><br/>2 hours of oppression, crying, bigotry, death and violence for absolutely nothing. There is no suspense, no retribution and there is no justice. It is just a stream of one dimensional white slave masters getting worse and worse.<br/><br/>Maybe I should have marked this as containing spoilers because I have basically described the film. Nothing really happens except that which I have described.<br/><br/>I am awe struck as to why so many people have rated it so highly. The story is drab and very poorly executed. The acting is alright but over the top. The only reason for the good acting is that the actors themselves are good. There is nothing interesting about the script or the lines.<br/><br/>All I could think of at the end was that I needed to watch an uplifting film just to get this film out of my mind. The point of a story should be to inspire you. Many films are sad and violent but at least they leave you with a sense of purpose.<br/><br/>Django unchained is not very serious and meant to be comedic, but at least it entertains. 12 years a slave is not even close to the story telling power of Django Unchained. That is a quality film... this film is not!<br/><br/>You have been warned (but unfortunately this will be lost under all the rave reviews). Dreadful film..."

","I hate to disagree with most of humankind, but I did not like this film. I understand that it was based on a true story, but dud the characters have to be so one-dimensional? The plot line is predictable, and I could recite most of the dialog before it was spoken. I think the worst aspect of this film was the direction. If he were still alive, Robert Altman could have given some sage advice to the director. His scenes went on forever, and he seemed not to know when enough was enough. Short cuts would have been wise. I did make it to the end of the movie, but I don't really know how. Good thing I rented it from Netflix and saved myself several dollars and some time. Too bad; hopefully this year's crop of Oscars contenders will be an improvement."
"johnnycagewins","5","7","13","21 January 2014"," Not bad, not amazing, highly overrated
","After watching this movie my first thought was ""Why is this so highly rated"", although by no means a bad movie. The story is one of shocking hardship and unfairness as experienced by our main character played by Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br/><br/>Performances are ranging from average bad to good, with Fassbender's dodgy accent and predictable character interpretation standing out as part of the weaker elements. Likewise Brad Pitt cannot be taken seriously, his one dimensional delivery destroys any narrative and leaves the associated components destitute of conviction. <br/><br/>Several times I felt I could be watching a TV movie albeit one with a larger budget than normal. Considering the topic there was a lack of narrative emotion which was compensated by some scenes of brutality and ""shock"". <br/><br/>A better director could have created a much more immersive production that engaged the watcher with more depth. As it stands a harrowing story, in an average package with a sprinkle of cliché and unintentional irony."

","I don't think i have ever seen a slave movie that just makes you want to cry and be thankful for your ancestors as this movie did. Roots maybe one of those type of things that will hit you soulfully but i think this movie takes the cake. Nothing in this movie is sugar coded everything is raw and brutal from the marvelous score from Hans Zimmer one of my favorite composers to a great performance by every person in this movie. Chiwetel plays Solomon Northrup is a free man who is kidnapped by these Con Artist and sold as a slave, thats the premise now if you read that wouldn't that make you upset and thats what a good movie does to make you feel all the emotion in the character like Solomon this is a guy who is very smart and intelligent and has to live as a slave for 12 years taken away from his own free family. I mean i can go on and on about this movie i loved it in every way and I want it to win if not best picture at the Oscars then at the golden globes. And one more thing Michael Fassbender as a slave owner is phenomenal if you thought Calvin Candy was despicable in Django Unchained then wait till you see him i would recommend everyone to see this movie for black history month so you can appreciate life and the struggles you face now are no where even close to what your ancestors had to face."
"EwenMunro","10","9","18","4 November 2013"," Watch 12 Years A Slave
","I have been a huge fan of Steve McQueen ever since I saw 'Hunger'. And I was even more impressed with 'Shame'. And because of those two films I was really excited to see '12 Years A Slave'. And the film did more than fulfill my expectations.<br/><br/>McQueen, in an interview, stated that the film was about ""love"", which might be hard to see in a film about slavery. But within the first series of shots this concept is evident and is a credit to McQueen's artistry. The first time I recognized this was when Solomon was sleeping and another female slave grabs him and forces him to touch her. The camera is still and shows them facing horizontally, surrounded by other slaves and in the darkness, showing us that this is off. Something is wrong. But then it cuts to Solomon and his wife, in bed, sleeping vertically with the sun, showing us that this is right. Another shot that the previous shot, with Solomon and the slave, correspond to is the shot of Master Epps raping Patsy further instilling in the audience that what Master Epps is doing is wrong. I mean, it's obvious that what Master Epps is doing is wrong, but I love the connections that this film makes.<br/><br/>Now, the long takes. The first long take is when Solomon is beaten in the jail. Which was so agonizing. I was eating popcorn watching it and I was about to eat one piece of popcorn I had to stop during that scene, because I was so in the moment. Two other long takes, that I liked was when Solomon was hanging from the tree and was struggling to stay on his toes as the other slaves feared approaching him, and your watching his struggle. And the other long take was during the end when Master Epps whips Patsy and forces Solomon to whip Patsy, and you feel her pain. And as a filmmaker, more like an up-and-coming filmmaker, I love the long take, because to me cuts take away from the reality of the scene. And the reason why I say this is when we look at the world our vision of the world doesn't cut. And the long take, to me, captures the entire picture of the scene as you would in the real world.<br/><br/>The last thing I want to touch on is McQueen's small personal techniques. And he has done this in previous films. In 'Hunger' it was the bee and the floating feather. In 'Shame' it was when Brandon cries during Sissy's 'New York New York'. These little gems simply create the human connections in the film, without very little effort. And in '12 Years A Slave', this is very evident. And two instances stand out, just like in 'Hunger' and in 'Shame'. The first instance is when Solomon is forced to burn a letter that he wishes to send to his family, so he can be saved and you watch the letter slowly burn in the darkness, it cuts to Solomon in pain, and then back to the letter as you see the flames, lighting up the darkness, slowly vanish. The other gem was when Solomon had given up, or it felt like he had given up and the slaves are singing 'Roll Jordan Roll', and the camera is locked on Solomon's face and we slowly see him come to singing with the group and getting his faith back.<br/><br/>'12 Years A Slave' is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. And a film for everyone to see and for filmmakers to learn from. Thank you Steve McQueen."
"richard-1967","10","9","18","3 November 2013"," Unflinching, uncompromising, unforgettable
","12 Years a Slave is the third and most important of three major films this year about the history of the African American experience. First came 42, a warm, smooth, and compelling story of the great Jackie Robinson's integration of baseball. Next came The Butler, a history of two sides of post-WW2 the civil rights movement wrapped up in about two hours. I also found this movie quite good.<br/><br/>But nothing can compare to the stark, clear-eyed, difficult-to-watch but extremely rewarding film that Steve McQueen has put before us in 12 Years a Slave. And it took 3 Brits - McQueen, Michael Fassbender and the extraordinary Chiwetel Ejiofer - to do it.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is not fun to watch. Unlike other movies, even great ones like Schindler's List, it pulls no punches along the way. All the violence done to slaves is here, in graphic form. It's not on screen for just an instant, but lingers as we are forced to watch. It is so well-done that it feels like the truth.<br/><br/>Ejiofer (""Chewy,"" my wife and I call him) has been one of my favorite actors since Dirty Pretty Things a decade ago. But other than a great star turn as drag queen Lola in Kinky Boots, he hadn't gotten the roles he deserves, playing cops on TV, sidekicks, and the like. No more.<br/><br/>Ejiofer is in virtually every scene. Closeups of his face seem to last minutes at a time. Solomon is a role destined for Oscar consideration, but ""Chewy"" goes as deep in his performance as McQueen has in his realization. <br/><br/>Great performances, and a great movie. Just make sure you're ready before you see it."

","""The aim of art, the aim of a life can only be to increase the sum of freedom and responsibility to be found in every man and in the world."" Albert Camus<br/><br/>No other film about slavery need be seen once you have witnessed the unforgettable 12 Years a Slave, directed by Steve McQueen with horror and grace. This adaptation, based on Solomon Northrup's Twelve Years a Slave, seems to perfectly translate the suffering and eventual triumph of African Americans in the antebellum South. Chiwetel Ejiofor as kidnapped and enslaved freeman Northrup should be Oscar nominated as well as the film and other supporting actors.<br/><br/>As Northrup endures a thousand indignities and brutal torture in his twelve years of being kidnapped, director McQueen, with the invaluable support of lenser Sean Bobbitt's lush landscapes and writer John Ridley's ear for the telling comment, never takes the torture over the top, as Mel Gibson did in The Passion of the Christ. Northrup dangling at the end of a noose for hours with only his toes between him and eternity is more harrowing than anything Gibson dreamed up. That Solomon hanging sequence can be matched only by slave Patsey's (an impressive Lupita Nyong'o) whipping in an extended scene of at least 10 unbroken minutes.<br/><br/>Although each set piece may have an overt message, e.g., Brad Pitt's Bass has a scene with Solomon that illuminates an enlightened Northerner's stand against slavery, the film concentrates on the personalities as well as the issues. As interesting as Solomon is representing a race wronged, Epps (Michael Fassbender), the cruel estate and slave owner, well embodies the flawed principle of ownership that drove the South's economy and its emerging loss of the slavery franchise. While Epps' misanthropy is evident, less obvious but just as vicious is his wife's (Sarah Paulson), whose Mandingo-like jealousy of her husband over his attention to slave Patsey impels her to seek an unseemly revenge on the young woman.<br/><br/>In contrast to Bass's humanity, this couple takes the honors for horror duo of the year in one of the best films of 2013.<br/><br/>""I don't want to survive.""

","Steve McQueen's first two features Hunger and Shame are both riveting and shocking films. Shame is my favorite Michael Fassbender performance and now his role as the deranged plantation owner Edwin Epps, in McQueen's brave and daring new film 12 Years A Slave, comes into a close second, but maybe upon multiple viewings, may slide into first. <br/><br/>Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was born a free man. While residing in Saratoga, New York with his wife and two kids, Solomon is drugged. When he awakes, Solomon finds himself chained to the floor, and from then on must fight to survive as he gets moved from plantation to plantation. <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor gives one of the most honest, intense, heart-wrenching performances of the year. Ejiofor is in damn near every frame and he is nothing short of miraculous. Then for a few scenes we get the always eclectic Paul Giamatti, who handles his role so delicately, and respectively, you can tell that he approached it like a true master. Giamatti's performance is so menacing and hateful, that his character has become the most hated character on film in recent years for me. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch is also on top of his game as William Ford, a baptist preacher who buys Solomon off of Giamatti's Theophilus Freeman. Paul Dano is fearless as the hot-headed John Tibeats. Dano has always been an interesting actor to watch, but his past two roles, Prisoners and now 12 Years A Slave are some of his finest work.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender's performance will have the hair on the back of your neck stand tall. It may be hard to watch a few scenes of his. If there ever was devil, it would be the character that Fassbender has embodied. Extremely strong work. Sarah Paulson gives an equally cruel, yet brilliant performance as Fassbender's demented wife.<br/><br/>The startling beautiful Lupita Nyong'o shines in her first feature film. Nyong'o plays Patsey, a slave Solomon has befriended. Every scene of hers is a stab to the heart with the ignorant, immoral brutality that is thrust upon her. Brad Pitt and Alfre Woodard both give limited, but strong on screen presences and both have memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen's directing has become almost flawless. 12 Years A Slave features some breath taking plantation imagery, while still showing the harsh conditions, hardships, and the blatant racism that these African-Americans faced. The pacing of the film is perfect, there is one lashing scene that is extremely detailed and will be hard to watch for most. There is one thing that my girlfriend pointed out to me, it was that they didn't show what Solomon's family went through, did they try and search for him? Did they presume he was dead? Those questions would have been nice, but ultimately thats just nit-picking and not what the story was about.<br/><br/>McQueen will most certainly receive award nominations, along with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender. 12 Years A Slave will not be a film for everyone, but I assure you if you give the film a chance, you will not be disappointed. This film has one of the best ensemble cast all year and all of its actors deliver masterful performances. I give 12 Years A Slave a 10 out of 10."

","My God, how the Hell can any anyone give this movie anything above 1 star let alone Oscars. This has to be the most hyped up, BS, dribble drooling, crap I've ever seen. People and critics alike are stating it's the best thing that ever happened since sliced bread...really? <br/><br/>12 years as a Slave is over melodramatic, lacking historical context and quite simply boring as hell. This movie lacked soul and plays on the heart string of anyone who ever was a sucker for such BS dribble.<br/><br/>It's not the actors fault this movie sucked. It had exceptional actors: Michael Fassbender,Benedict Cumberbatch , Paul Giamatti and Brad Pitt. A stellar line up expect for Lupita Nyong'o AND SHE WON THE Oscar FOR HER PERFORMANCE. She was the weakest of the cast and her acting was over dramatic to the point of nausea. Truly I dare you to compare the scene where she is being punished with the whip to Denzel Washington's performance in Glory (1989) and seriously think who truly deserved that golden midget statue?<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor, as Solomon is mis-casted as the lead. His character really doesn't develop much, which is the reason the audience don't fully engage with him. Sure we follow his journey and feel sympathy but along the way you realise Solomon is a douchbag. He is suppose to be intelligent, articulate and..well...smart. Come on dude! where's the personality. Seriously, it that does not translate at all through the screen. I reckon the book is better on character development and empathy. <br/><br/>The editing and pacing was choppy that it makes you want to pull your hair out. It was all over the place and it is very noticeable in the beginning of the movie. The first and second act were slow but the haste to put the main actor in the south was rushed, and so was the ending. <br/><br/>And the costume, what the heck? 36 minutes into the film and you realise he's the only slave in the bayou wearing knee high boots? Say what???<br/><br/>I'm not even gonna bother with Steve McQueen as a director...he is really not worth the effort. What is truly bothersome is scenes are left hanging and there is no follow up, or any explanation of what is going on and why. Where's the back story to the main characters & supporting characters? Where's the humour to add lightness and texture to the movie up after a heavy sombre screen (the beatings) like in The Color Purple (1985) or the interaction of the supporting characters. <br/><br/>The script was the only thing that made sense but the execution of the story was poorly done. When you think about it you've seen the story line before with a sadistic boss and a slave:- put Lupita Nyong'o as a slave Jewish maid and Michael Fassbender's character in a Nazi uniform and in WWII. Wham!! same relationship scenario in Schindlers List with Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) and Helen (Embeth Davidtz) only better direction of their relationship and the dynamics of it.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to see a film about the human spirit and triumph over evil view Schindler's List (1993). <br/><br/>For those you are interested in a the plight of the slaves in America see Roots (1977). It might be dated but it's better that the sordid mess called 12 Years as a Slave."

","Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man living in upstate New York with his wife and two kids in 1841. Solomon is tricked by two slave catchers, named Brown (Scoot McNairy) and Hamilton, (Teran Killam) who tell Solomon they are with the circus, but really ply him with liquor and sell him into slavery to the plantation of Ford, (Benedict Cumberbatch) who also buys a slave woman named Eliza (Adepero Oduye), but Ford cannot buy Eliza's kids. <br/><br/>Ford is a relatively good hearted person, but that does not spare Solomon from cruel treatment from one of the field bosses named Tibeats (Paul Dano) who tries to hang Solomon and leaves him hanging there until Ford cuts him down. If things are not bad enough with Ford, Solomon, now given the name Platt, is sent to the cruel and sadistic slave owner Edwin Epps. (Michael Fassbender) <br/><br/>Epps thinks of his slaves as his property, and will do anything to bend their actions to his will; Epps literally wants them to dance when he plays a tune. Epps does not like Platt, and makes it his job to break him. Epps does have a fondness for Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) and Mrs. Epps (Sarah Paulson) sees how much attention Patsey is getting from her husband, she shows her displeasure by throwing a whiskey decanter at her head. When Mr. Epps sees Solomon talking to Patsey, he whips Solomon and tells Patsey to stay away from him. When Patsey goes to another plantation for a bar of soap, Epps orders Solomon to whip her, and then viciously whips Patsey himself. Patsey is also repeatedly raped by Mr. Epps, and she can take no more.<br/><br/>Patsey begs Solomon to kill her, he steadfastly refuses. Instead Solomon a man named Armsby (Garrett Dillhunt) a man on Epps plantation, who seems to be sympathetic to Solomon's plight, to deliver a letter to some abolitionists up North, who know that Solomon is a free man. Instead Armsby tells Epps of Solomon's plan, and Epps burns the letter. Later, a Canadian named Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt) shows up to Epps' plantation and Solomon asks Bass to deliver a similar letter to the one that he asked Armsby to deliver. Does Bass do it? Or does he doublecross Solomon, as Armsby had done? This is a brutally violent movie, but it is also brutally honest. <br/><br/>I usually don't care for historical dramas about slavery or segregation from Hollywood, because they tend to change the history to fit whatever end they're trying to put forth, or they try to sugarcoat the experience of slavery or segregation in some kind of revisionist feel- good way. If you don't know what I mean, please see The Help. I know the character of Solomon Northup existed because he published a biography contemporaneously to his kidnapping, and this movie does not sugarcoat his life.<br/><br/>The writing by John Ridley is poignant and heartbreaking. Even when Solomon is not being whipped or beaten, the fear of slavery and its attendant pain follows him around like a constant shadow. He bears the pain of Eliza, who weeps constantly at the loss of her children, he is asked by Patsey to kill her, she prefers death to being even a favored slave. Solomon sees hangings of runaway slaves all too routinely. The stories of Solomon, Eliza and Patsey are intertwined and so the viewer,not only cares about Solomon, but the ladies as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Steve McQueen is truly noteworthy. Almost from the first scene the film envelops the viewer. In that first scene the camera is at eye level and wading through the sugar cane fields of Louisiana. To illustrate the voyage down South McQueen focuses on the paddle wheel of the riverboat, and when the wheel fills the whole screen, the scene is over. That is captivating camera work. There is one scene that stood out in the movie, however. When Solomon is hanging on the tree, put there by Tibbeats, the other slaves go on with their business, seemingly oblivious to the man literally hanging in their midst, until one slave woman gives him a glass of water and meekly scurries away. They are so afraid of the master's retribution that they dare not cut Solomon down. And McQueen lets that scene play out for an excruciatingly long time. That is great filmmaking. If you don't know this Steve McQueen, watch Hunger, about the hunger strike initiated by Bobby Sands in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. Fassbender is a raving dog one minute, and calmly ordering everyone to dance the next, he knows he can make these slaves do anything, they are toys to him, puppets. It is that controlled rage that makes his performance so interesting to watch, he will be nominated for Best Actor, Chiwetel Egiofor gives a stunning performance as Solomon, he can hardly believe what happened to him, and now he's got to outwit his masters and stay alive, at a time when his life was worth nothing more than the amount of cotton he can pick. He should be nominated for Best Actor as well. The women in this film are phenomenal as well Adepero Oduye is outstanding as Eliza, she conveys the pain of separation from her two children about as well as anyone I've seen. Lupita Nyong'o gives a heart-stopping performance as Patsey, this is her debut film. And Sarah Paulson is also outstanding as the stern, domineering Mistress Epps. All three of them deserve nominations. Paul Dano and Paul Giamatti are also very good, the only laggard in the bunch is Brad Pitt, who plays a boring character in a predictable way. Mr. Pitt, I appreciate the money you put forth and the skill you used to get this movie made, but please resist the temptation of casting yourself in the movies you produce.<br/><br/>For more epic reviews, visit my blog: reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

He's kidnapped in Washington, D.C. and sold into slavery to work on plantations in Louisiana - until freed twelve years later. <br/><br/>The film is slow, boring and heavy-going. It doesn't give enough background and context for viewers who aren't knowledgeable of mid-19th century America. There's also very little about the protagonist's life before and after the twelve years that are the focus of the film."
"hisimperialmatt","2","6","11","28 May 2014"," Very boring, ignore the hype
","I made my account just to warn people away from this movie. After hearing all the awards it won and all the acclaim it received, I decided to give it a shot. I was more than a little disappointed, and I will never again be deceived that a movie winning an award means anything. <br/><br/>12 Years a Slave had the potential to be a great movie, with an interesting storyline about a free Northern black man being captured and sold into slavery down South. <br/><br/>With a plot like that, the story has basically written itself. Instead, they decided to solely rely on the plot line and not actually put any effort into the movie at all. The characters were horrible. I couldn't care less about the main character the entire movie. The entire point of getting back to his robotic, emotionless family still eludes me. It was obvious to me neither he nor they cared at all about one another, other than him saying he wanted to see his wife and children. Other characters pop in and out of the story without any true purpose. An overseer that tries to kill him, then runs away; another overseer that saved him, for no reason, just disappears from the story; the indentured servant that betrays him, vanishes; his first master (a nice white guy), gives him a violin then is never seen again. If any of these characters were cut out of the movie, NOBODY WOULD NOTICE. <br/><br/>The fact that he was a violinist could have been used to add more flavor to the story. Somehow it doesn't. He is forced to play at some parties, but there is never a point to him having a violin. The violin is constant throughout the movie, but there is never any reason for it. It is never used for anything interesting, its just there. It could have been used to show that he was slowly losing passion for something he loved, which may have been the intention for it, but was a complete failure. He destroys it near the end, maybe that was when he gave up hope? I can't tell that he ever cared about living in the first place. With the violin in place I can't help but try to compare this movie to the Pianist, maybe they should have taken notes from it. <br/><br/>There are multiple random scenes that are drawn... out.. for.... too.. freaking... long. Prepare to spend several minutes staring at his face, waiting for something to happen. Go ahead and fast forward if you can, nothing will happen. <br/><br/>So far the movie has neglected to develop any interesting or relevant characters, as well as an interesting back story. The movie instead focuses on how bad slavery is. Just in case you missed the memo. Now, I understand with this kind of movie there is going to be traumatic events that happen to the characters, I think everyone expects that. But after the initial 10 minute whipping scene, followed by lots of racial slurs, mothers and children being separated, followed by 2 rape scenes, followed by more whipping and beating for no reason and general disregard for human life, I couldn't help but feel like it the movie was trying to tell me that slavery was bad, and that was the ENTIRE purpose for the movie. Yes, slavery is bad.... I already knew without you telling me. I'm not sure if I have ever met someone who thought otherwise, who is this movie making an argument against? There is a difference between having it as a setting/theme to your movie and shoving it down your audience's throat. This movie should take a lesson from The Pianist, Schindler's List etc. that use similar themes of oppression but are still great movies. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the characters were horrible and forgettable, nothing interesting happens, and slavery is bad (obviously). That's all you should know about this movie. 2/10 only because this an interesting period of American history, and I wish more movies were put in this era (but not this one)."

","At this point, I'm tired of movies getting a break because the subject matter is ""important"" and ""socially relevant"". I'll concede this is a high quality movie crafted by professionals to produce a haunting effect on those that watch it. I just tire of watching the debasing of people from a horrible period time and time again. I tire of us giving awards to these films because it is a socially correct action. <br/><br/>I compare this to ""The Color Purple"", another fine movie I refuse to ever watch again. The searing pain of watching people abused washes out any kind of positive movie experience possible. Yes, events like this happened and I can't help the world solve every de-humanizing act or give proper retribution to those that suffered. And I know for a fact that watching it displayed in gripping horror on a large screen is not going to help my coming to terms that I had white ancestors abuse other humans. <br/><br/>It seems the success and recognition of these films is just going propagate similar films until we bleed from watching them. How about a film of nothing but beatings? Throw in a little story, but make sure there are copious amounts of footage showing people getting shredded like cooked meat. Will that be enough? Will it ever be enough? No, I don't think so. <br/><br/>If you want to watch this kind of movie knowing full well what you will be facing because, let's face it - there are no surprises here, then by all means, watch it. Award it. Keep producing more and more filmography offspring. Because, evidently, there are plenty of people that want to continue wallowing in it. I have no appetite for it any longer."

The white person seems to be practically a Nazi. it doesn't add up to reality of the 19th century. the protagonist's story really isn't that interesting either. they shouldve either made Solomon's story more interesting, or followed the wife's story primarily. her story was much more meaningful and sad.

","It's hard to express the emotional impact of this film, starring the Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o, Alfre Woodward, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt, and Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>Eliofor plays Solomon Northrup, in the true story of a free black man living in the north who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. It's a brutal story. You see these people treated like merchandise, separated from their children, and the cruelty of the land managers.<br/><br/>Northrup at first is pretty lucky -- he is sold to one of the more humane landowners, Ford (Cumberbatch), who takes advantage of the fact that Northrop is an excellent musician and reads the Bible to them on Sundays. As Cumberbatch points out, though, Ford isn't a nice guy -- he like the rest of them use slaves as their economy is dependent upon it. What's even worse about Ford is that he has no control over his horrid manager.<br/><br/>In order to keep Northrop from being killed by said manager, Ford sells him to another owner, Edwin Epps (Fassbender), a complete nightmare who is taking sexual advantage of one of his slaves, Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) and enjoys being mean. His wife is jealous of Patsy and also makes her life a living hell.<br/><br/>All of the performances are excellent, and this movie was filmed in Louisiana and is gorgeous to look at, belying the sadness and horror.<br/><br/>Great movie."
"estebangonzalez10","9","6","11","16 January 2014"," McQueen delivers a powerful film about the lack of human compassion
","""I will not fall into despair till freedom is opportune!""<br/><br/>Steve McQueen is a brilliant filmmaker who makes movies that are sometimes difficult to watch, but at the same time are powerful and engaging. His characters usually are troubled souls who experience some sort of physical, psychological, or emotional torture. They are slaves of their circumstances, and no character literally captures these elements as well as Ejiofor's Solomon Northup as he is chained and sold into slavery. Some people claim that films about slavery and the Holocaust are overdone and exploitive, but I disagree, if made right they can be powerful and sensitive like was the case with 12 Years a Slave. The same people that make these claims are the ones that don't mind going to see five or six superhero or vampire films a year. There are good superhero movies and terrible ones, and it's the same thing with films dealing with these dark historic moments. This film isn't just a movie about slavery, it's a movie focusing on Solomon's story, it's a character study focused on an exceptional man who is determined not to lose hope or fall into despair. I'd even go as far as saying that more than a film about slavery, this is a dramatic and thrilling movie about the lack of human compassion. There are several villains in this film and they aren't only the slave masters, we see several scenes were even slaves turned their backs on each other, and that lack of compassion is what truly captured the essence of this film.<br/><br/>This beautiful screenplay adapted by John Ridley from Solomon Northup's autobiographical book, Twelve Years a Slave, tells the story of Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man and New York citizen who was kidnapped, sold into slavery, and forced to work in several New Orleans plantations during the mid 1800's. This is where Solomon's fight for survival begins as he is determined to regain his freedom and return to his wife, Anne (Kelsey Scott) and two children. Once Solomon is sent to New Orleans he is sold by Freeman (Paul Giamatti) to a wealthy slave owner named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). Ford is a kind Christian, but ultimately he really wants to look out for himself and when Solomon has trouble with one of the overseers, Tibeats (Paul Dano), he sells him to a ruthless slave owner named Epps (Michael Fassbender). This is where Solomon's soul is really put to the test as Epps cruelty is unbearable. However, Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) suffers the most from her Master's cruelty as she is raped and despised by Epp's Mistress (Sarah Paulson). We follow Solomon through these tormented 12 years as he experiences all sorts of horrors until he finally finds a compassionate heart.<br/><br/>This superb film benefits from a powerful lead performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor who deserves all the awards he's been receiving. His facial expressions and agony transcend the screen and break our hearts. The same could be said from the supporting performances from Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays the more complex character and probably the only one that isn't either white or black morally), and Michael Fassbender who is the personification of cruelty. Fassbender, who was also brilliant in McQueen's two previous films, plays one of the most despicable characters in recent film history. McQueen's direction is outstanding and several of his scenes were beautifully shot while at the same time very disturbing. His trademark long takes stand out in this film. The whipping scene is horrifying and the long shot where he is tortured and left hanging while we see everyone else going on with their normal lives is a testament of the central theme of this film which had to do with the lack of human compassion and mercy. This is one of the best films of the year and completely deserves all the hype it's been receiving."
"phd_travel","10","6","11","19 December 2013"," A must see - heart breaking
","If you think you already seen enough of slavery on screen this year with Django, think again. This movie is completely effective because it's a true story of a free black man kidnapped into slavery. The film is direct and very personal in its photography and direction. The scenes of the brutality feel terrifyingly real. Every whip or beating has impact. The jumping back and forth in time in the beginning though not too confusing wasn't necessary. The story has a varied mix of good and evil white folk and plantation owners and the different types of sufferings both male and female that the slaves endured.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Chiwetel Ejiofor who has always been good at acting worried and sad in other movies like Tsunami the Aftermath is very good here. He doesn't over do it and makes it believable. Of the other slaves, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey with her pure African looks is perfectly cast and her acting is convincing the scenes of her beating and rape are heart breaking and hard to forget. In contrast with the horrors, the photography of the plantations and Louisiana bayous is very scenic and evocative. Michael Fassbender and Sarah Paulson as evil plantation owners are better than expected. Casting of Paul Dano and Paul Giamatti wasn't so good. They came across as good guys playing bad ones for this role.<br/><br/>Although the subject matter is so depressing and sad, this movie is surprisingly watchable. The brutality is never for the sake of violence but serves to move forward the plot. One of the best movies on slavery made to date."
"bkoganbing","9","8","16","29 January 2014"," Degradation and Despair
","During the days of the big studio system slavery was a topic that was generally avoided. The standard interpretation of the era's history made such work as Birth Of A Nation and later Gone With The Wind the way we saw the era. It was the Civil Rights Revolution that opened a lot eyes and now with a bit of perspective there, a film like the incredible true story 12 Years A Slave could be made.<br/><br/>Not only is it true what happens to Chiwetel Ejifor's character this was hardly a unique situation. Slave catchers were really down on the social scale even at that time, but it was a business to them. So of course if you can't find a genuine runaway slave, why just take any black person that answers a general description. Naturally free black people were on the alert, but these two low lifes who capture him use stealth and planning to bring him to the south and sell him.<br/><br/>This story of degradation and despair is a future cinema classic and ought to be required viewing in schools and for those who think any group of human kind deserves to be treated in this way. Slave owners knew exactly what they were doing when it was forbidden to educate a slave. If you remember in Band Of Angels Clark Gable did educate the child who grew up to be Sidney Poitier almost to his dying regret. The hardest thing that Ejifor has to do is conceal his education in order to survive.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender plays the last and worst of a series of plantation owners who Ejifor is in slavery to. Fassbender is amazing to watch as his character sinks into moral degeneracy as more and more he has to justify this system. <br/><br/>The saddest story in the film is not our protagonist's. Rather it is that of Lupita Nyong'o who plays a woman separated from her children when she's sold off in a slave market which is placed in someone's parlor. The degradation and misery she endures can only be compared to Schindler's List and clearly 12 Years A Slave was influenced by that Spielberg masterpiece. You have to a Medusa victim not to be moved by Nyong'o on the screen."

","I put off watching this movie when it came out because of the hype. Now it's calmed down a bit I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I wasn't expecting the film to be incredibly boring. I struggled to keep any interest whatsoever in any of the very turgid story telling. I remember watching Roots many years ago and being captivated by the emotional drama. This film was so childishly written and presented that any emotional impact was entirely lost. It had a Little-House-On-The-Prairie simplicity that grated in every scene. I half expected Pa to appear, playing his fiddle along with the main character. Pa's emotional depth would have fitted right in with this dreadful movie. Chiwetelu Ejiofor seemed as bemused by this film as I was. He was wooden, but then he had very little to get stuck into with Northup. He had no emotional connection with any other character in the film and I really couldn't care less whether he lived or died. I wasted hours watching this that I can't get back. I'm only glad I didn't pay for it."

After about an hour of the film, I decided to stop squirming and leave--that I would enjoy not seeing it more than actually seeing it.

","12 YEARS A SLAVE is one of those movies on the borderline between Big Budget and Just Plain Boring. While the intentions may have been good (the only thing I came away with was the idea that even slavery was something that could be overcome with a lot of hard work and some unbelievable LUCK), it's Ejiofor's lackluster performance- and the ridiculously LAVISH look and feel of the movie- that undermines whatever serious message or insight(s) the filmmakers may have had in mind. Not ONCE during the course of the movie did I BELIEVE what I was seeing: it has an almost over-fed Television quality to it (not unlike DJANGO UNCHAINED, for instance).

"intelearts","10","7","14","16 January 2014"," 556th Review: One of the Singularly Most Important Films of the Decade
","12 Years A Slave is more than a film - it is, as noted, superb, and I mean really superb as in a meaningful subdued grown-up mature cinematic experience - it has sequences that must make the hairs on the back of Terrence Malick's neck go up - the cast, the technical crew, and above all, director, Steve McQueen, will be lauded feted and deservedly all the good karma coming their way - but it is also one of the singularly most important films in film history.<br/><br/>It has taken America 140 years to finally begin the process, which South Africa did in the Truth & Reconciliation Commission, of addressing openly the unbelievably deep wound of slavery - that still divides cities, that still determines worth and status, that still...<br/><br/>This film tells of the absolutely true and unquestionably verifiable story of Solomon Northrup. There were 100s of such narratives collected and published in mid-century America by abolitionists though Northrup wrote it himself and his editor David Wilson was not an abolitionist. There are also accounts in Vermont and other newspapers of Northrup's lectures etc;. 12 yrs tells the story of a middle-class man, a family man, with a solid schooling, a good job: an ordinary American excepting, one detail. Without spoilers he, obviously given the title, loses all instantly and ends up a slave.<br/><br/>Look, film needs more than Tarantino's sardonic satires: the greatest films did not ""entertain"", they do not simply offer an emotional escape for two hours, they should, hopefully, change something inside those who see them.<br/><br/>See it twice. If it seems too disconnecting first time then see it again. It deserves it. It is a film that drives for an honest take on the American Holocaust (60 million children, as Toni Morrison points out in her groundbreaking Beloved, never saw adulthood - if that's not a holocaust what is?). <br/><br/>Let's just hope it creates space for America to stand still and stop still determining that some deserve, and some deserve to be in their place. We created slavery as an industrial process. It's just going to take forever to fix that pain unless the wounds are drained properly and that at least the high culture to take a stand. 12 Years is horrific without showing scene after scene of sadism, what is shows is more simply horrifying: men and women, families, like you and me, but without any choices in their lives - no choice allowed, not over their children, their work, their right to die. The real living dead. <br/><br/>Above all, this is a film without platitudes, its about quiet placid suffering, and courage - it never shouts it credentials. It is more than just Roots for a new generation - it also opens up future history too.<br/><br/>My instant reaction as I headed home in Sweden is that this film is the Schindler's List of the post-millennial - it's will not be seen by as many, even if it wins the Oscars it deserves, but here's hoping many more will go, if it does.<br/><br/>How many really important films are made in a decade. This is a really important film.<br/><br/>I'm laying my cards on the table: Oscar Winner of 2014 for best film, male lead for Chiwetel (though Matthew MacCouhany deserves it too), supporting male (Fassbender), supporting female (Lupita Nyong'o over Sally Hawkins - hers is coming for sure though), editing, sound, and finally Steve McQueen - sentimentally I want it to be Woody's year, but this is a truly important and groundbreaking film."
"thefadingcam","9","7","14","6 January 2014"," The historical confrontation through an unique visual experience
","12 Years a Slave director Steve McQueen is on those authors whose movies will be remembered for many, many decades. This movie, just like Shame and Hunger, goes beyond the masterful aesthetic of the picture and camera to a sober, solid and honest drama about a free man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery on the United States. 12 Years a Slave embodies by nature the characteristics required to be considered an award winning movie, that is sure, but the movie goes a lot further and disconnects itself from that award aura. The north-American slavery theme is not a recurring one in cinema, even if the recent Django Unchained walked those steps one year ago. McQueen proposes a well paced movie that chooses feeling over gore, atmosphere over shock. The movie develops and gets better over time, presenting a lot of well written real characters that end up being shadowed by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender's unbelievable performances, only matched by Cate Blanchett's Blue Jasmine this year. 12 Years a Slave is not an easy movie to sit through, nor is it a particularly hard one. It is, above the drama, a contemplative movie that respects the audience. This is not a candy to chew on, but a gourmet dish to look at before tasting. Cinema at its best level, and probably the best movie of 2013. Visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot! Also like us on facebook to follow all our reviews!"

I was a big fan of his before this but he has further proved he deserves to be in the discussion of best actors in his generation. Luptia Nyong'o who plays a young slave girl and the object of Fassbender's psychotic infidelities will probably hear her name for a nomination on Oscar night. Most likely Fassy will as well and possibly Paulson. And then we have Chiwetel Ejiofor - my god man, you are AWESOME. This is the biggest slam dunk best actor Oscar since DDLewis in TWBB. If this is an indication of the films coming out this award season, I am so stoked.

"editor-805-973151","10","7","14","30 October 2013"," A Raw & Rivoting Look Inside the Business of Slavery
","As a southerner and lover of history, I know all about slavery and the trail of blood and tears it left on families throughout America. However, my knowledge of this history and the workings of slavery would not and did not prepare me for 12 Years a Slave. British director Steve McQueen placed me in a time capsule and introduced me to Solomon Northup (actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, pronounced CHOO-ih-tell EDGE-ee-o-for), a freeborn African American man who was kidnapped, transported to Louisiana and enslaved. Honestly, I felt as if I was in the antebellum South, picking cotton, being lashed, witnessing lynchings and praying that one day I'd be free...<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Northup while describing the very detailed and grueling atrocities he faced while a slave. Prior to his kidnapping, he was a well-off educated and talented husband and father in Sarasota Springs, NY who played the violin. But one incident would revoke him of his human rights, strip him of his birth name (renamed ""Platt"") and lead him to an auction house to be sold as cattle. However, as millions of other slaves, Northup would learn to adjust to the cruelties that he would face in the name of a God who condoned the enslavement and mistreatment of others.<br/><br/>After viewing 12 Years a Slave, I was raw (emotionally and mentally) as I hadn't witnessed anything as riveting since Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ. As I sat in the movie theater about nine years ago with closed and tear-filled eyes, listening as Jesus (actor Jim Caviezel) took lashing after lashing my heart ached. And then to be escorted to that place again by McQueen, let's just say that I'm fragile and raw but wiser. While it hurts to know that the country that I love allowed hatred to imprison generations of my ancestors, I'm wiser because I know that I must be the change I want to see. Hate has no place in this world and I'll always use my voice and keystrokes to advocate for those who are mistreated as a result of it.<br/><br/>I applaud McQueen on his ability to pull moviegoers into Northup's world, not with sympathy but with a genuine respect for his ability to live in an unfamiliar world and not give up on his desire to see his family again. More so, Ejiofor's acting was mesmerizing as he pulled me into his world each time I gazed into his eyes."
"Amari-Sali","9","7","14","18 October 2013"," With this film, slavery is truly defined, seen, and felt. It sets a precedent you hope no film ever tries to match.
","To be honest, I am not sure why as a Black male I subject myself to watching films focused on slavery. You learn about it in school, hear about it from parents and grandparents, and the internet is filled with pictures which make you internally grateful you are born in this day and age. Yet still, something draws you in like the advertisement of horror movies. You know you'll be frightened, but not by some crazed, sometimes mystical, being, but by something that you only missed out on by 2-4 generations.<br/><br/>In the movie, to me there is only a handful who really stand out worth noting. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup naturally stands out, for he is the lead who we watch live 12 years with swaying hope, a consistent sense of pride, and a tongue which constantly makes you think he has a death wish. Joining him is Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps, who pretty much is despicable that you hope you get to see him die violently, brutally, and to the point he can't be recognized. Alongside Edwin is his wife Mary Epps, played by Sarah Paulson, of American Horror Story fame, who, at best, is like a mad dog barking, but rarely having the guts to bite. Then, in my opinion, the only person left worth mentioning is Lupita Nyong'o's Patsey, a young girl who works hard and who finally represents the often ignored plight of a Black woman enslaved on a plantation.<br/><br/>As for the story, we cover Solomon's journey from a freeman to a slave. During this journey we see a man who had an education, skills, and a sense of being dignified, be dehumanized to the point where you realize that, even now, no matter what type of paper you hold, be it one saying you are a freeman, equal citizen, or what have you, it doesn't change the color of your skin and the way others perceive, and will treat you, because of it. Luckily for us though, 12 years fly by and though brutality is in every other scene, the pain is shared and Solomon does have some moments when he gets even the most minuscule of victories.<br/><br/>Now, I am well aware of the many praises of the film there are, and while some of it is definitely granted, in other areas I feel iffy. But, to start off, I believe there is so much praise that should be bestowed on Lupita Nyong'o. Though this is Solomon's narrative, her character at times steals any feelings you'd think you should have, or do have, for Solomon. She makes your body shake, your face tense, and may make tears fall from your eyes. As for Chiwetel Ejiofor, I must admit I didn't think much of his performance for most of the movie, but as the movie comes to an end you realize why. To me, it was because of a sense of empathy to the point of being sometimes like stigmata. Solomon has to numb himself so much to keep hope that you end up numbing your emotions as well. However, when there is a rope around his neck, you do feel your collar tighten; when he is beaten and healing from his wounds, you start to become uncomfortable in your chair like sitting against something, no matter how soft, is just masochism; and though you are given many reasons to cry, you suck it up for you know it won't do much for you to shed tears. But, during the final scene, when the self-induced Novocain wears off, you shed tears like he does and let go of all that you've held in throughout the movie and even find your body, as you leave, numb and shaky from trying to keep your composure, as Solomon had to for most of the movie. <br/><br/>Which leads to me going into what didn't work with the film, of which there isn't a lot. The first thing I must note is that it seems the film tries to pull a Django at times by having Solomon fight back or talk slick, giving him a moment where he outwits his slavers and gives you some relief from him being continuously forced to be subservient. Such, at least I felt, seemed a bit unreal and it, to a small point, diminished the would-be villains, like Fassbender's Edwin Epps, a bit. Though I must not Edwin quickly reasserts himself. Outside of that though, the only issue I could have is that for most of the movie you may find it hard to connect to Solomon, or realize you are doing it. Because of that, you more easily attach yourself to other slaves' stories, especially the women like Lupita Nyong'o's and Adepero Oduye's characters. Oduye plays a slave named Eliza in the film. Because of this be it Eliza, Patsey, or even Alfre Woodard's character Mistress Shaw, Solomon's story becomes less of an interest and you end up wanting to learn about these women much more. Perhaps though that is more a praise to the women than a criticism though.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>To me, this is a film you see once and never again. It is brutal, graphic, and I personally found it triggering my freedom and Civil Rights were given only a few years ago. And it really does touch you that deeply too, and whether you are a man and end up feeling Solomon's pain or take on the pain of the Eliza or Patsey, you don't leave the film without being the least bit scathed. Which is why I say it is worth seeing. Nyong'o surely gives an award worthy performance which thinking about makes my breaths shallow and eyes begin to water. Ejiofor holds his own as well, but he is definitely put in Nyong'o's shadow. This isn't to say though he surely doesn't deserve accolades."

","I watched this movie completely unaware it had won any Oscars and I have to say I was surprised to learn that it had. The main character is a fine actor and reminded of the roles once played by the late Paul Winfield. What I found incredible was the sheer incredibility of the storyline. <br/><br/>The slave story has been done to death, as has the cruel master, etc. Therefore, upon learning the film had won Oscars, I was even more astonished. Here you have a free man, a family man, accomplished and well-known and respected in his native upstate New York and yet he goes off willy-nilly with a couple of self-described circus performers and ends up in slavery for 12 years. The questions are immediate and many. Did he not discuss this venture with his family and well-heeled white friends before setting out? Would they not have advised him against going to a known slave state(s). Did he never attempt to write to them giving an update on his itinerary? In 12 years, did no one investigate his disappearance?<br/><br/>Of course in the dozen years of captivity, he made no attempts to escape so far as we can tell and yet he often made sure that others were aware of his ""intelligence."" Supporting characters were sketchy as well. The one played by Alfre Woodard for example would seem to be in a position to assist runaway slaves or those who wanted to but her basic cameo role is incongruous and I suppose meant to show that white slave owners had black mistresses. Big shock! And patronizing of all is the part given to himself by producer Brad Pitt, the film's white man with a heart. With a part as brief as Woodward's he is introduced as an itinerant abolitionist berating his slaveholding ""brother"" for the evil of slavery and predicting the slavers would ultimately pay the price for this injustice to mankind. And yet, when approached by the slave for help in posting a letter to those who might rescue him, he balks, claiming fear for his own safety if he did so. But in the end he capitulates and of course the ending owes itself to his efforts.<br/><br/>I have to add this spoiler as well. When the evil master demands that our hero whip the master's black chippy (which actress won an Oscar too) I was dumfounded that, given all he knew about this man and had even engaged in an altercation with him himself, that the slave complied. I really was. <br/><br/>Perhaps the film was meant to show that any man can be broken. If so, then I do not think it succeeded at that either. When a film at its conclusion has to include so much written screen explanation, I think that shows that the film is lacking. This film bored me and seems like a film about slavery that whites would make who had no knowledge of the situation at all."

","This happens so often. Hollywood churn out these so called masterpieces and it gets viewers excited about another 'wow' of a film. That being said, Hollywood has also failed at given us a masterpiece, and viewers have been failed by the major critics also.<br/><br/>Positively, the scenic shots in the film are very good. It sets the tones well, and creates the moods needed. Acting is fine throughout, At first it is easy to blame the actors for some of the negatives that I will mention shortly, but having thought long and hard about it, I feel that the actors done the best they did.<br/><br/>And that's it.<br/><br/>Negatives come thick and fast in this feature. It starts with the disconnecting storyline, leaving the viewing more stranded and confused than the acting lead. I have no issues with a touch of confusion or the slight misleading of direction if it is part of the style of the film. Sadly, 12 Years a Slave leaves you trying to work things out at various scenes when trying to absorb the story. Very distracting. Some of the scenes go into the graphic torture of the lead but in other areas it leaves your mind to do the math but sadly this never works because the story does not connect the dots.<br/><br/>The story itself is very drawn out, making it feel like a 5 hour feature, and it could have been told in half-an-hour. This was possibly due to the overshot scenes of nothing. Scenes where the lead just breathes for about a minute of screen time. Scenes from the plantation, of workers in the heat, but the camera remaining there for ages. These scenes had no benefit to the film other than to be fancy. I don't mind the artsy stuff, but when it prolongs the agony, it stands out very clearly. This is a big failing of Hollywood and the big critics, they like the artsy stuff, but then seem to forget about the story. This is usually followed up with a string of Oscars... and the story repeats again and again.<br/><br/>There is also no concept of time/year, maybe that's a good thing as this is possibly how the lead actor feels so this could go either way.<br/><br/>I don't really think it succeeds in capturing a huge a slice of the history during the times either. It does bend a little political and fair to certain extents, but fails to touch other things that happened at the time. So what we have is a focus point but not the bigger picture. I have read many historical details during these dark times but they are not really elaborated here. What you simply have is a man that is mistreated, horrifically, and emotionally crushed in a country that does not listen to him. The film is focused on the horror and the artistry that it forgets about character and story development. So you come away learning absolutely nothing more than we already know. It also feels that lots of footage is missing. I just get that feel that this is why the story fails to flow.<br/><br/>I think what we have here is a style over substance film. These are the films to watch as they tend to get so much credit but will leave you wondering what all the fuss was about. A lot of people will follow like sheep and believe that the top critics are telling them the truth, just like newspapers tell us who to vote.<br/><br/>An artsy film with no substance mixed with a known horror story from history, add some great scenery with a broken story and a touch of fine acting - and you have a picturesque film with a pointless drag of a story.<br/><br/>GIFT-A-SCALE: 4 out of 14"
"JonathanWalford","6","5","9","23 April 2014"," Mediocre attempt at the slavery story
","This film had the opportunity of being the Schindler's List of American slavery, but it fell short. The story was engaging enough, but the filmmakers took just enough liberties with the facts in the real story to plunge the film into mediocrity. To begin with, there is a completely unnecessary sex scene in the opening that adds a non-sequitur to the true story and immediately sets the film off on the wrong foot. <br/><br/>The film lacks character development. According to the real story, Northup's first master was much kinder than depicted in the film, and his second Master far more demented than what was depicted. These are golden opportunities for a filmmaker to show these extremes in human nature to tell the story and reality of slavery, in the same way Schindler's list took the opportunity to show the range of human character and experience during the holocaust. But in this film all the southern women are painted as cold and jealous, and all plantation owners as deluded or drunks.<br/><br/>This film wasn't about why the institution of slavery is bad, it is how it worked and the extremes of how people behaved within the institution of slavery. The film could have been so much more powerful, even if the original story is, as I suspect, highly suspect of being 100% accurate. After all, it was quickly ghost written in 1853 for an abolitionist demographic. Regardless of whether everything happened to this one man in 12 years or not, all the stories are certainly true, even if not all experienced by Solomon Northup. <br/><br/>Historical accuracy is called into question when it comes to many of the other film's faults, from the overuse of formal Victorian language, dirty clothes being worn by actors with fluorescent white teeth, stained glass front doors in Saratoga Springs in 1841, and plantation chairs from British East India on plantation verandahs... too many things that suggest to me a superficial attempt at historical accuracy. <br/><br/>After the book was published in 1853, some felt that Solomon Northup was part of a conspiracy to collect money from slave traders by using himself as bait and that the money collected would be divided among the three men, but then everything went wrong and Northup ended up a slave. THAT is a fascinating premise to begin this tale, and the film would then tell Northup's story within this context. There was more opportunity to do this story than the watered down version of the 1853 story. Too bad."

","I was quite looking forward to seeing this Academy Award winning movie but was completely disappointed in the extensive use of on screen violence and revolting sexual exploitation/rape. I'm sure it's a true story but there are ways to tell that truth in movies with innuendo instead of explicitness. <br/><br/>I believe the story should be told, but this movie is such a turn off that I think it does the story of suffrage faced by African Americans an great injustice. It represented the worst element of that era in such a limited storyline, exploited by a modern movie making machine that cares little about the real story of slavery and more about shock value to tell it's story. My family is part African American and I would not take my children to see this movie. <br/><br/>The story deserves a better script and direction. This movie, was revolting to watch. The scenes were way too slow and had no depth of character development. As shown it left the viewer feeling that the plot was so simplistic, in its unitarian tale of abuse that it lacked any real storyline that one could embrace and carry with them as a balanced view of slavery. <br/><br/>Slaves did experience hardship, and degradation by some landowners who treated them as property, but it was also a time with African Americans became some of the most skilled workers of their time. Many slave owners used them for economic reasons and treated them as a valued commodity. Most of the architecture, furniture, machinery used in the south was built by skilled African Americans. All of the farms of that time were cultivated by African Americans. I'd like to know just how many slave owners of the day were sexual perverts who raped children and whose wives were sadistic torturer's as this movie displays them to be. I suspect a lot less then whoever adapted this script would have you believe. <br/><br/>I really don't see how anyone can consider this the best film of the year? Compare to past winners I think it's a disgrace that the academy would choose this film, that was done so poorly; No plot, no cohesive storyline and extremely poor direction."

","12 Years a Slave, had it been conceived, written and directed by a 12 year old, might have deserved its lavish praise. As it was not, it is unfortunately the most over-hyped movie in a while. For youngsters who were not yet born, nor old enough to remember the TV series ""Roots"", 12 Years a Slave may well seem shocking, and a serious and meaningful stab at bringing this subject to life, but the superficiality, plodding pace and relentless sermonising killed any emotional impact it could have had. It wasn't short on suffering, most of it endured by the audience who suffered right from the start, as the first 10 minutes or so was irritatingly shot in semi-darkness and extreme close-up, making it jerky and difficult to follow. This broke any rule of ""grab their attention right from the beginning"", as the stream of apparently unrelated scenes made it seem as though the director couldn't decide on how or where to begin.<br/><br/>Worse was to come, with good actors asked to play stereotypical characters in stereotypical scenes, and even less forgiveably, a complete failure within this mess to meaningfully depict the real horror and despair of an educated man being stolen away and brought so low. This chance was passed up in favour of trotting out the usual overseers with whips, drunken plantation owners, bitter and frustrated wives, and of course the apparently kind and enlightened white man who nevertheless shows his true colours when the chips are down.<br/><br/>This film simply does not compare to the sweeping story told so movingly and effectively in ""Roots"" decades before. It also has nothing to add. 12 Years a Slave is Roots-lite, with added pomposity. Why it was nominated for best picture and best director is beyond me. Why it actually won an Oscar for best picture says more about the right-on public face of the Academy than the calibre of the work being judged. It is unfortunate that subject matter holds such sway over voters. My verdict is watch it, and then do yourself a favour and watch the vastly superior ""Roots""."
"thepepperlanders","5","5","9","11 March 2014"," The Book is great......... The movie ? ...so ...so
","If you want to watch how modern day Hollywood elites view slavery then by all means watch the movie. The visuals are outstanding. If you prefer historical accuracy, you should read the book (free online since the copyright has long since expired. In the movie, Soloman Northrup is kidnapped and taken aboard a slave ship with other blacks (and of course with evil white sailors) and sold into slavery. In the book he is kidnapped and held by a decent crew. One crewman even sends a letter to his family in New York letting them know about the kidnapping. His family contacts the governor of New York and all decide that it's best to wait until he is purchased to better find him. In the movie his decent owner doesn't want to hear about any kidnapping. In the book Soloman Northup's biggest regret is not telling his decent owner of the kidnapping because he later realized it's likely he would have been released from bondage. The book is an outstanding read about slavery from an very observant and wise man. He sees the world in shades of grey. Some southern whites are good and some are bad, just like up North. He is consistent in finding slavery as a terrible institution but also understands how a persons environment shapes their beliefs. An interesting tidbit is that the original asking price for Soloman Northrup is $1500. In the book, he gets smallpox and gets very sick soon after arriving and is sent to the hospital where he says he is treated decently. After a few weeks he comes back pockmarked and is sold for $1000. One should note that most people couldn't own slaves and that there were even a few wealthy blacks that owned slaves. The price of slaves ran from several hundred dollars all the way up to several thousand (not surprisingly) for a beautiful & female slave. The average income of a printer in 1850 (a well paid profession at that time) was over a bit $300 year. The majority of whites in the south didn't make enough money to even own one slave. The dialogue of the whites and blacks in the movie is a terrible interpretation of a wonderful book that should be required reading in all American middle school classes. Unfortunately Americans don't read and the movie will become part of our ""official"" history. My advice, read the book instead and you will get a much better understanding of what he went though and the institution of slavery."

","From the deeply painful and agonizing pages of his own life's story, comes this gripping tale written first hand by author Solomon Northup and directed adroitly by Steven R. MCQueen. His memories reveal what took place 1n 1841. The place was Saratoga, New York and Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is making a living playing his violin and enjoying his life with his wife and family when he is tricked into believing he can earn more money if he will accept some temporary musical employment in upstate New York. The ruse results in his being abducted and sold into Slavery. Once in chains, he is drugged, manacled and whipped into submission, then thrown into a dark prison cell. Once in bondage, he decides to accept his fate until he can find some way to extricate from the chains of captivity. The movie itself is a frightening and terrifying expose on what Black Americans had to endure during their years of punishing captivity. For the audience, one has to refrain from displaying an immediate reaction to the torturous and barbaric scenes in the film. The cast which includes Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt (In a cameo Role) and the incredible script left me stunned watching the painful legacy of our own history. Mr. McQueen wore a tapestry of both sorrow and triumph with the autobiography penned by Solomon Northup himself. It's little wonder why the movie has garnered so many accolades, awards and prestigious honors across the country. A hardy 'Well-Done' is called for upon seeing this masterful work of art. Recommended to all those who wish to see a Classic in visual form. ****"
"jdkraus","9","5","9","18 January 2014"," An important film that studies the human condition in order to survive against America's most violent ages
","""12 Years a Slave"" follows the story of Soloman Northup, a free African-American abducted and sold into slavery. The movie's center is not so much the journey as it is about the man and his struggles. He faces unimaginable odds and ultimately triumphs after 12 harrowing years. Many words can be used to describe this film. Cruelty, and man's preference to bondage and brutality. Complete despair. Yet hope, compassion, and emotional power. This film is a true experience that is brought to life with bold energy and performances that will burn deeply into your memories.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor as Soloman Northup delivers the greatest performance of the year. He evokes a man of torment and sadness so perfectly that I could feel his suffering in my soul. He gives us a character that can tell us what he is feeling and thinking without uttering a word--his facial expressions and voiceless body language is that good. Not many thespians can achieve this rare talent. Lupita Nyong'o as his fellow slave Patsy achieves equal acting capacity. I have never seen a character that I felt such pity and sympathy for. She exemplifies the thousands if not millions of persons whose voices have gone unnoticed over the centuries from the inhumanity of slavery. Having won the SAG award, she could very well go on to win the Oscar for supporting actress. Michael Fassbender in contrast does not convey as such a strong or in-depth character as Ejiofor or Nyong'o. He acts more like a three-dimensional villain than an actual believable character. He does play the drunken, psychotic, inhumane slave owner well though.<br/><br/>The technical accomplishments are something to admire. Director Steve McQueen relies heavily on extreme close ups on both his actors and to emphasis important details during a sequence. He also utilizes long takes with few cuts, allowing scenes to progress without interruption. The cinematography is pretty decent with its ominous low-key lighting at night and the use of natural lighting during the day shots. The costumes and set pieces, though sparse, help add to the authenticity of the period. Hans Zimmer's score is mainly a two-note, slow-paced melody, exemplifying the passing of time. While simple it is subtle and moving. He does squeeze in some of his loud, bombastic moments. <br/><br/>This movie has achieved just about everything I had desired and expected from it, except for one little thing. And that is the movie's focus. I understand the humanizing of Northup, and the cruelties of slavery, but that is all the film really examines. I anticipated more of a recreation of Southern slavery in terms of how they lived, their way of life and daily activities, and how they engaged and coped with the trials of the days. (Note: the book goes more deeply in these regards) Plenty of barbarity is shown in this film. Enough to make the audience members of the theater I attended to gasp and utter the occasional ""On my!"" Focusing only on the violence is just one part of the bigger story. I understand that so much can only be covered in a two-hour film, but the cup does not feel full. The ending in particular feels rushed, not giving enough information to view 12 years of a man's life. No matter, this is a very good filmeven a great one. I add it on my Best of 2013 list. However, this is far from the likes of other masterpieces created over the years."

"d_meadows","9","6","12","16 January 2014"," The Unblinking Eye of Steve McQueen
","Based on the extraordinary autobiography of the same name, 12 Years a Slave charts the abduction and imprisonment of author Solomon Northup. Beaten and near broken, he desperately tries to maintain what shred of dignity he can as he looks for a return to his life as a free man.<br/><br/>The ever eloquent Solomon is played out superbly by Chiwetel Ejiofor. Introduced to us amid the upper classes of New York, Solomon is a skilled fiddle player and a much respected, loving family man. Deceived by two men (promising the fame and fortune of a travelling circus-like gig), he awakes in a cell, chained. What follows is his descent into the booming slave trade of New Orleans and to his new life as a prisoner. <br/><br/>Shouldering the responsibility, Chiwetel commands every inch of the screen with the performance of a career. We look out into this world through Solomon's eyes and so Chiwetel's ability to portray compassion, humanity in the face of the most inhumane situations, is the films greatest achievement. Not content on simply surviving, Solomon is a character with a fire burning beneath the surface. Baffled by his predicament, he is forced to mask his intelligence for fear of his life. In one particular devastating scene, he sings straight from the soul at the funeral of his fellow slave. Accepting the situation, almost the entire scene frames the tortured face of Solomon. <br/><br/>It takes a fine actor like Chiwetel to maintain a hold on the film when the Van Gogh looking Michael Fassbender is in this kind of form. As the sadistic slave owner Edwin Epps, he prides himself on being the so called 'nigger-breaker.' He spends his days drunk, bearing over his land and his nights awakening his 'property' to dance for his delight. He is relentless in his barbaric treatment to all and yet ideologically insecure in his self loathing love for Patsey (Nupita Nyong'o), the most competent of his slaves. He continually sparks off against his wife (Sarah Paulson) as she competes for the affection for his most prized possession. Fassbender excels in colouring the grey areas of character psychology, proving once again his ability to layer a man who, on the page, could threaten to be two dimensional. <br/><br/>12 Years a Slave arrives at a time when America's neglected, ugly history is finally beginning to reach an audience in cinema. Most recently the toast of last year was the much debated Quentin Tarantino effort Django Unchained (2012). The waves of controversy it welcomed were however pale in comparison to what is witnessed here. For here there are no quick witted catchphrases or sharp tongued characters. No splashes of soundtrack to interrupt the historical horrors. Just the unbroken take of a black body hung from a tree, life on the plantation carrying on around him. It is unfair, and perhaps inevitable, that the two will be compared. Each director has taken this subject matter and gone about it in their unique manner. With Django, America's Slave Trade was but the back story to the tale of bloody revenge Tarantino was telling, an historical setting for the narrative to react to. McQueen however has unashamedly brought it to the front and centre. The study of one man's suffering in both Hunger and Shame, dwarfed here by the millions that suffered the sins of humanity. What else could critics find to criticise than the decision to tell one tale of twelve years, subsequently ignoring its mammoth history? True, this is but a drop in an ocean of injustice but nonetheless a very wise decision it seems. No film weighing in at two hours could ever do justice to a near two hundred and fifty year holocaust of enslavement. By giving focus to a man who at one time enjoyed equal status, now stripped of liberty and identity, it hands the audience a vehicle from which they can witness and respond to. <br/><br/>Let us not forget that this is a product packaged for entertainment just as Django Unchained was, or any other film for that matter. It will no doubt go on to win gold and earn a great deal at the box office. Yet great films bring great debate and this is precisely what McQueen offers. Whether it wins awards or not is now irrelevant, what is important is that it now exists. Striking with visceral impact, McQueen's intense, unblinking eye has earned him the reputation of a fetishist, which is unfair. Audiences are being shown these images not for sadomasochism but for their artistic merit. Whereas lesser directors avert their eye and suppress these scenes, McQueen keeps the camera rolling, allowing the images a voice. As expected it is a test of endurance and yet for such an ugly subject it is an aesthetically beautiful, if brutal piece of work, uncompromising, necessary and strangely his most accessible film to date."

Indeed it already has 10 nominations at the BAFTAs and surely chief amongst them is McQueen's.<br/><br/>Whatever you may think of the movie itself it's the point of it that deserves most attention and applause. Now, that sounds worthy but it shouldn't be seen as such because it is not just a monumental piece of filmmaking, but one with purpose, vision and bravery.<br/><br/>The first EVER feature film about slavery. How can that be? The politics of America that's how.<br/><br/>Sure, Tarantino made a brilliant pastiche of slavery last year with Django Unchained, and for those of us of a certain age Roots long lives in our memory (but that was a TV series). So too, Lincoln focused heavily on the issue, but not the experience.<br/><br/>This, however, is a full on cinematic release described by one reviewer as the ""greatest film ever made"" that unswervingly captures the experience of one man kidnapped from a life of freedom, of privilege, in 1841 New York and transported to the sweltering cotton and sugar cane fields of the deep south.<br/><br/>What follows is almost two hours of unremitting injustice, backache, torture and frustration as the aforementioned Solomon Northup tries to prove his status as a free man, fighting injustice when he can but more often than not having to suffer in silence to protect his very existence.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the title role, is on screen throughout, sweating like no actor I've ever seen, in the oppressive Southern heat and humidity.<br/><br/>His performance is both proud and defiant and as the movie progresses increasingly moving.<br/><br/>Once again Fassbender commands the screen as evil plantation and slave owner, Edwin Epps, but at times scenes are stolen by his super-evil wife played by Sarah Paulsen.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt scoops an important cameo role, perhaps thanks to his role as Executive Producer and, by all accounts, he is one of the main catalysts for the movie to happen. It's only fair that his character is a catalyst for the resolution of the movie.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch also puts in another fine cameo performance as the one ""good guy"" plantation owner and initial ""owner"" of Solomon Northup. The counterpoint between him and Paul Dano as the plantation overseer is excellent.<br/><br/>Other supporting roles are well played, but this is essentially Ejifor and Fassbender's movie.<br/><br/>No, it's not actually, it's McQueen's.<br/><br/>This is a masterclass in direction with foot perfect cinematography, a very good score by Hans Zimmer. The movie's perfectly paced, with just the right amount of lingering mood and tense action. One scene in which Fassbender's concubine is whipped to within an inch of her life is truly appalling. You flinch at every stroke. By contrast the scene where Northup simply turns his head right to left, up and down, as if to say ""help"" is breathtaking in its simplicity and resonance.<br/><br/>It WILL go down in history as an important document of America's deepest guilt that festers even today, and McQueen WILL win both his first Oscar and a Knighthood.<br/><br/>Above all else though, it is a great, really great, movie."

","I want to put into words how this film affected me, but, appropriately enough, there aren't the words there. Steve McQueen's adaptation of Solomon Northup's memoir is a film in which words are precious and very carefully chosen – whether shouted or sung or uttered in whispers out of earshot of the savage ruling class.<br/><br/>Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man tricked into slavery. The story charts his ordeal – and those of countless others – under the tortuous watchfulness of a series of plantation owners, cruellest of whom is Edwin Epps (McQueen regular Michael Fassbender). It is a film whose relentless scenes of abuse are punctuated by levity of only the most desperate and solemn kind, and which is determinedly unbothered by the comforts of sentimentality.<br/><br/>Ejiofor captures the agony at the heart of Northup, from the initial indignity of his situation, through physical torture endured, observed and committed, to the brutal annihilation of his character through supremacist re-education. In place of the stock conclusions drawn by Hollywood, John Ridley's script has other ideas: rather than rousing speeches there are bursts of quickly-suppressed anger; instead of soaring emotion, upon release Northup remains bound in the shackles of guilt left upon him by the guilty.<br/><br/>As with his previous films (Hunger and Shame), McQueen embeds meaning in the frame. These aren't pretty images for the sake of it. The burning of a letter represents the dwindling of hope – and yet how long it seems to take to dwindle, and we linger until every sliver of fire is spent, staring ever harder for the remaining light in the darkness. Northup is staring also, unblinking, into the abyss of humanity around him, holding out for some such glimmer.<br/><br/>In terms of characterisation (do we call them characters if these monsters truly existed?), Ridley and McQueen's greatest decision is to give as much depth to the masters as their slaves. Epps is a vile creature, but we are dared to empathise with him as he impotently hands the whip to Northup, under the emasculating gaze of his jealous wife (Sarah Paulson). The object of Epps' violently ambivalent affections is Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) an angel in a world where the beautiful and the talented are particularly prized for self-sanctified hatred.<br/><br/>So it seems I have found the words to describe a little of my experience of watching this remarkable film. It's a reminder that cinema is not solely a reserve of entertainment, and that the atrocities of humankind sometimes need to be shown to us – nakedly, harrowingly, unforgettably."
"TheSquiss","10","6","12","8 January 2014"," Exceptional, harrowing film. Not just a must see; a should see!
","Do we really need to see such vivid displays of barbaric abuse tantamount to torture in the 21st century? While educated humans still hate, judge and mistreat others for their sexual proclivities, gender, religion, class, physical appearance and race, then the answer is emphatically yes! <br/><br/>Steve McQueen's third feature as director (after the lauded Hunger and Shame) is harrowing. Don't even think about entering the cinema if you're looking for entertainment or an easy ride. There are many fine films dealing with the issues of racial inequality and slavery (try Amistad or Django Unchained) but 12 Years a Slave is in another league and it's unlikely you'll emerge light of heart and dry of eye if there is even a nugget of justice and humanity inside you.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave, adapted from his autobiography, depicts the true story of Solomon Northop (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a husband, father and respected free man living in New York until 1841 when he is duped, kidnapped and sold into slavery by Theophilis Freeman (Paul Giamati) and bought by the comparatively kindhearted Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) before being passed on to the sadistic landowner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). For twelve years Solomon endures unimaginable violence and abuse that to merely survive requires a miracle of fortitude and fate.<br/><br/>It is difficult to present any negative criticism of 12 Years a Slave without sounding petty. If there are any weaknesses, they are substantially drowned into submission by the deafening volume of all that is powerful upon the screen. At every turn there is excellence, in every blink a sound or image to not merely prick our conscience but to perforate it.<br/><br/>McQueen has crafted a film that numbs as much as it wrenches. But whereas Mel Gibson set out to horrify us with his flaying of Christ's back in The Passion of the Christ but served only to sicken us with his gratuitousness, a similar scene in McQueen's sensitive hands is compelling. It is horrible and horrific but so carefully shot that we cannot look away because this is yet another part of the lesson we absolutely must acknowledge and comprehend. There is no sense of entertainment, only a reluctant presentation of the truth.<br/><br/>But it isn't just in the physical displays of violence that McQueen shreds our comfort zone. His lingering shots that refuse to be hurried along hold our reluctant gaze, intensifying our discomfort. As Solomon dangles from a noose on tiptoe, battling to remain both upright and alive while fellow slaves play and toil around him, steadfastly refusing to be moved or involved, it is left to us to witness the barbarism. If Solomon cannot escape, why should we? <br/><br/>The seemingly endless shots occasionally bring temporary comfort; the embers of a burning sheet of paper lingering, dancing silently, peacefully before the next scene shakes off our security blanket once more. Joe Walker's editing works symbiotically with McQueen's direction, juxtaposing contrasting emotions to ramp up our discomfort; as the peaceful scene of a Christian service unfolds with Ford preaching kindly to his workers, the soundtrack of the previous scene, Paul Dano's Tibeats tauntingly singing Run, N****r, Run, hangs over it like a poisonous cloud. We try to hear the kindness in Ford's words but the unbridled hatred of Tibeats' deny us peace yet again.<br/><br/>McQueen sprinkles 12 Years a Slave with suggestions of compassion (a gift to Solomon from Ford) but these are only hints of humanity from people too afraid, too cowardly to do something meaningful, and each hollow gesture is just another, subtler act of betrayal.<br/><br/>It isn't much of a prophesy to say that this is certainly a career-changing and perhaps a career-defining performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor. He was reputedly reluctant to take the role, fearing he would not do it justice and would let those down who suffered Solomon's fate. He need not have worried. The memory of his eyes variously piercingly defiant or hollow with grief remain long after the final credits roll. There are others who have performed with the same honesty and intensity as him this award season, namely Robert Redford in All is Lost, but none will leave you feeling raw and ashamed to be the same species as Solomon's owners. I think the phrase you are searching for is tour de force.<br/><br/>In his third film with McQueen, Fassbender plays Epps as a man who, in another life, might be Amon Goeth. Though Epps' actions are monstrous, Fassbender resists playing him simply as a monster, managing to portray his weaknesses and thoughtful reasoning as valid parts of him. In the moments when he refuses to give in to his hateful wife we see a man who has his own brand of goodness buried under his prejudice.<br/><br/>Making her cinematic debut, Lupito Nyong'o as the object of Epps' attention, Patsey, gives a performance beyond that of many season stars. Again, it is a performance that leaves one feeling raw and bereft. 12 Years a Slave is complete because the cast enhance the emotion and intensity that McQueen creates around them and every scene lives because of the skill of the actors that fill them. Brad Pitt as the Canadian abolitionist, Bass, brings a welcome gentleness to the film but we, like Solomon, don't know if his words are genuine or the precursor to another betrayal.<br/><br/>It is perhaps an understatement to say that 12 Years a Slave is a very, very powerful film. It is not just an exceptionally well-crafted film but an important one that leaves the viewer numb, tear-streaked, shaking and wondering if the biggest betrayal is not that we once behave so abominably but that in so many ways we still do.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","Had the potential for eternal glory in cinema history, but the soundtrack, and the editing were off that badly. Luckily, if you're a person who can appreciate a stellar screenplay, directing, acting, and cinematography without paying attention to the afore-mentioned fumbled aspects, then you will love this movie. <br/><br/>Yes, it's horrific how the character's life changes and how if we put ourselves into the character's shoes, we realize this just may be the worst possible fear for anyone in his or her right mind. Unfortunately, just as I started to feel that, I got rattled by the strangely cutting in and out of the soundtrack and random objects flashing large against the screen. The lasting impact is that the mood was fumbled: Instead of taking horrific to mean the horror of realizing that we, as a species, hold that kind of sadistic torture in our souls, the direction shifts manically between the direction of a campy slasher movie, an experimental Bruce Connor kind of movie, and a pretty good cover of ""The Passion of the Christ"". Come to think of it, there may have been this kind of mix of editing styles in ""Shame"", but for some reason, it fit more smoothly there, possibly because the latter movie was more psychologically-rooted, whereas this movie is more situationally- and historically- rooted. So, the flashiness only takes us out of the feel. It's as if in the editing room, there was an argument about whether to try to capitalize on the hidden little art crowd or the larger shock- and-thrill audience, and they tried to capture both rather than trying to stay true to the movie's potentially independent spirit. Sad, but here's hoping for a new edit!!!!"

","I thought this movie would be miserable to watch and it was. It was well done and if you want to see a simplistic movie showing slavery at its worst this is your movie. The setting were beautiful and the actors were well cast. However there was not much new about the story short of his being made a slave and his inability to escape. The slaves seemed to have no lives of their own or concerns of their own short of reacting to the master, and to have a stronger sense of themselves and their misery than anyone told all their live they were chattel, would have. The most scary and discouraging thing I ever heard on the subject was a former slave saying she had 11 kids and the master must have been really glad of her. This was missing from the movie. It is based on a book meant to be propaganda for the abolitionists and while true is probably an amalgamation of unpleasant stories the author knew of combined with some he experienced. The real story of slavery is one of good and bad men caught in a horrible system and it is complicated. But if you like horror movies with blood and two hours of gut wrenching evil and this for you."
"zetes","10","6","12","10 November 2013"," Heartrending true story of slavery
","This year's sure thing for Best Picture. I don't personally think it's the best picture of the year, but no doubt it'll be one of the more deserving of that award (it ranks #6 on my 2013 list as of right now). It's an utterly devastating picture, doubtlessly the most thorough, accurate and brutal portrayal of slavery in the American South ever committed to film. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as a free man in the North. While touring as a fiddler with circus performers, he is kidnapped by slavers and transported to the South. He becomes the property of plantation owner Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a fairly benevolent master, but he soon crosses ways with his overseer (Paul Dano), and Cumberbatch is forced to sell him to a much crueler man (Michael Fassbender). Fassbender is keen on raping his slaves, in particular Lupita Nyong'o. Ejiofor, who at this point realizes that the only way he can survive is to keep his head low, becomes entwined in the drama between Fassbender, Nyong'o and Sarah Paulson, playing Fassbender's wife. Ejiofor has been a fantastic actor for over a decade now (I first noticed him in Dirty Pretty Things, but he also had a major role in Amistad, which I never did see), but this is the role he'll be remembered for. He gives one of the subtlest performances in recent memory. In many ways, he has to. His role is all reaction - while he does get a couple of big emotional scenes, mostly he's playing a man who has to keep his head down. He's an educated man, and if his masters catch wind of it, they could very well kill him. What he witnesses, though, in addition to what he suffers himself, is so horrifying that it becomes impossible not to react. Of the rest of the cast (which also includes Brad Pitt and plenty of other familiar faces), I think the only other one who deserves accolades is Nyong'o, who just kills it. Adepero Oduye, as a woman who refuses to stop weeping for her children, who were sold elsewhere, also impresses. In my estimation, none of the white actors really deserve too much praise. Cumberbatch and Dano are probably the best. Fassbinder's likely to get all the awards attention, but I thought he was pretty unsubtle, almost to the point of mustache twirling. McQueen's direction is very subtle, almost to the point where you won't even notice how good it is. One major complaint I have is that you don't really feel the time pass. If it weren't called 12 Years a Slave, you wouldn't even think more than a couple of years had passed by the end of it. Honestly, it could have been longer. But, then, it can be such a harrowing watch that I don't know that I'd want to see any more. I wouldn't say it was painful to sit through, though. I'd see it again in a heartbeat. It's rare you get a film so genuinely powerful."

","I was very excited to see this movie! I have heard so many good reviews and comments about it from people and from the press. <br/><br/>I felt the cinematography was fantastic! A lot of luscious colors and intriguing camera movement at times, especially the shots of the ferry and swamp. <br/><br/>However, I started to get disinterested about 45 minutes in. Yes, there were some really intense scenes, and to this day it is still very tough to watch slaves be beaten. However, I felt the acting was very 1-dimentional, and sad to say, I felt this even for Solomon's character. No doubt i felt bad about the actions brought unto the slaves characters for their emotions showed it, but as far as dialogue between characters, it was very monochrome. <br/><br/>Maybe part of why I felt it was emotionless and dry was the fact that I felt this story in which the attitudes and actions that were done onto the slaves from the owners were ""sugar-coated"" compared to how they were portrayed in ""Roots"", ""Django Unchained"", ""Amistad"" and others. Obviously being born in the late 20th century, the only way I would know of what it was like is through books & cinema, but it has seemed that the way this intense, heartbreaking topic is better portrayed in films previous to this one. <br/><br/>This is a very touchy subject to this day, and I strongly believe it should be told and retold again and again. This is a horrible event in history, no doubt. One of the great factors of cinema is not to only entertain, but to inform the audience even if it's not for a great subject. Unfortunately, this particular flick didn't present an angle that kept me from turning it off 1.5 hours through."

","The cinematography is great – pretty, ""meaningful"" artsy long shots – but this film could have been so much more. I live in Bristol, a town built on slavery (both black and before that white) which struggles to come to understand its past and the way people behaved – this film simply didn't engage on that level. I didn't feel any great empathy for any of the characters, their motivations weren't explored at any depth, it didn't really raise even the most obvious questions of the way people behaved beyond the most superficial level. And yet it has been really warmly received – maybe it's the power of political correctness, or could it be a commentary on a nation that still hasn't yet the maturity to come to terms with its roots. I'd give it a miss."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","4","7","2 May 2014"," Let me explain my stance on this film:
","I'm just going to get down to my point: Twelve Years A Slave is a good film. It may be an even better film to people who know less about slavery, however, to me it is just ""A little better than good"".<br/><br/>Twelve Years A Slave tries really hard to make the audience uncomfortable by showing the truths of slavery and the cruel world slaves lived in during the middle of the 19th century... and it succeeds at it. The movie doesn't hide how messed up some of the slave masters were and how delusional others were. I have read a bit of the book along with the autobiography of Frederick Douglass and several other slaves. The movie does interpret these events very well.<br/><br/>However, this is where the movie's fault comes in: The movie isn't much more than a slave statement. Slavery is bad. Here is a man who changed and went through much suffering. While I condemn racism and I'm glad this movie shows the wrongs of the past, the movie doesn't do anything more than show a whole bunch of wrong doings. The movie is just: bad event, bad event, bad event, bad event--coincidentally similar to Gravity in a sense. The movie doesn't stand up and prove anything that the audience (maybe it's just me) didn't know. We have seen slavery movies in the past and we have read the autobiographies. The movie forgets to be something more than an anti-slavery statement. Slavery has already been gone in America for over 150 years, so the movie needed something more to its message other than ""slavery is bad"". <br/><br/>Granted, racism is still an issue today, which is why this movie still holds importance. Still, the movie doesn't try to do anything other than inform of the evils of the past. The movie is literally a series of horrible things and that is it. As soon as the evils end, the movie ends. In my opinion, the movie needed to flesh out its purpose a little more.<br/><br/>On a side-note: This movie has one of the most generic soundtracks I have ever heard, and it is even down-right bad at times. Not even joking, you will hear the same chords played exactly the same for the entire movie.<br/><br/>A good movie, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table regarding the issues of America's past."
"riccilaura62","10","4","7","24 March 2014"," Not a Film but a Portal into Our Nation's Past
","My first movie review for IMDb. I was so moved by this film that I am compelled to write about it. The acting was phenomenal, the cinematography (shots of nature and sky, plantation homes, it's beauty surrounding so many horrors) exquisite, the long shots of particular scenes that amplified the feelings they invoked- straying away from contemporary films that change shots every 2 seconds (or less)? These long shots mimicked life, what the viewer would really see if he or she stood witness to the atrocities. Based on the true life of Solomon Northup, a man who was captured and stripped of his rights, escaping 12 years later and writing his story: Solomon is an educated man, exquisitely played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, from New York in the late 1800s, who lives happily with his wife and two children. He is kidnapped and taken on a ""reverse underground railroad"", eventually deposited in the deep South, his identity beaten out of him, watching as others in captivity like him are abused and murdered for trying to escape, speaking, for following orders, after crying for stolen children. We follow this man from plantation to plantation, sometimes picking cotton, other times building homes, hacking sugar canes, etc. etc. meeting different Masters and their wives. Through Solomon's eyes we see the system of slavery that entrenches every character, man, woman, child, black, white. Solomon keeps trying to survive long enough to escape and see his family again, back in New York, but as he so eloquently explains to another man while in captivity who suggests he ""keep your head low, don't let them (those keeping them in captivity) know who you really are"" (lest he is brutalized or murdered for knowing more than a slave should know), ""I don't want to survive. I want to live."" The final Master before our protagonist is released after more than a decade in captivity exemplifies so many conflicting character points. A drunk Master, unpredictable, charmed by his slaves (rousing them from sleep many a night to entertain him in the parlor, dancing to songs that he demanded our protagonist play on his violin) like a person who collects Pokemon cards, picking up or discarding at whim, while Master wife looks on in disgust and contempt. He is charmed enough by his slaves that his wife, violently wracked by jealousy when her Master husband singles out a slave girl and rapes her every night, threatens to leave him often and questions his loyalty to his own white race. He's superstitious and admissions that there is no ""intrinsic truth or justice, just what is financially his"". This character hates himself for liking his slaves, for lusting after one, and his jealousy when his chosen rape slave produces soap given to her by another plantation owner moves him to whip her within an inch of her life. My debt, my money, my property. His anti-thesis is the Brad Pitt character, ""What is good for one is good for all. Laws change. What if one day our rights are lost and we (the whites) become the slaves?"" The script is powerful. The words heavy and time appropriate and illuminating."
"writerever365","10","4","7","21 March 2014"," To Be Watched For Its Importance As Well As Enjoyment
","While anyone who looks at my IMDb page will see I am a sucker for a film about African-Americans who overcome, this film was different.<br/><br/>12 YEARS A SLAVE, directed by the amazing Steve McQueen, is an important, powerful movie. There is simply no other way to say it. It is wonderfully crafted, beautifully acted, and stirring to watch.<br/><br/>But like many movies where there is tragedy or tragic-but-true history, this movie is not necessarily one to be watched for enjoyment. That is not to say you cannot get some enjoyment out of this movie - far from it. There were a few scenes where I just had to laugh, particularly in one comical sequence where Northrup beats his own master (that sounds mean, but the man's reaction is downright comical).<br/><br/>But when I say it is not one to watch for enjoyment, what I mean is, that is not this film's sole purpose. The film's purpose (as the filmmakers oft pointed out when they were receiving this film's 3 Oscars) is to tell the very real story of Solomon Northrup. <br/><br/>That being said, there are quite a number of scenes in this movie that are very hard to watch. As is often the case in movies where there are whites being cruel to blacks, more than once, I looked down at myself, uncomfortable in the skin I'm in (I'm white). I felt guilty for the actions of my ancestors. <br/><br/>Now, I realize that, in the end, evil is overcome. A scene at the end, where Solomon is finally liberated, particularly shows the victory over evil (aka the loathsome Mr. Epps, in Michael Fassbender's most easily hate able role yet).<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is stirring, important, powerful, sometimes hard to watch (and a bit unsatisfying at the end, but such is life), and altogether, one of the most amazing movies I've ever witnessed. Mature audiences will love it and cherish it for years to come."

There's no real depiction of an escalation of frustration or passion in Solomon.<br/><br/>There was also no real indication of time passage either. Twelve years go by, he gets released, his kids are grown. It's almost like for 11 years he looks the same and then when he arrives home, he's got gray hair.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's role was kind of a Deux Ex Machina. Solomon asks for help and it arrives. There was danger for white people helping slaves but here everything goes fine. Solomon tolerates his situation for years and then he asks someone else for help. He never makes a break for it as you would expect.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was kind of horrible. Kind of like watching TV while someone is running the vacuum cleaner. You needed to focus more when the soundtrack kicked in.<br/><br/>The direction was competent, nothing great. It wasn't like ""Hey Mom, look! I'm a director"" where the director tries too hard. The acting wasn't bad. Lupita Nyong'o did a good job. I kind of thought Michael Fassbender was a psychopath, how he could ever have owned a plantation escaped me.

","Depicting slavery is definitely nothing new in cinema, but there has only been few that are as serious to the subject as 12 Years A Slave. Since the quality of this film is meant to win awards, it surprisingly takes a straighter direction. One might expect a large amount of schmaltz poured out the memoirs of Solomon Northup, but it turns out to be a tough message against the condition, making sure the suffering is the core while the emotional subplots are reserved to the side. 12 Years A Slave never had the will to distract the bad things happening on screen and that what makes it more than compelling.<br/><br/>At the first steps of Northup's struggle, you may think while traveling to their destination there would be minutes of breathing expressing their affliction as the score plays a very sad music. But that wasn't the priority, the exhaustion and misery continues as if they're completely doomed in their fate, even a plan for revenge is not worth trying. The journey is no preachy glam, it's all pain being flowed from one event to another. It examines these explicitly to make the audience realize that none of the treatment of slavery is accepted in any natural way. It still joins us to the characters' personal issues but in a brief way. It would have been a richer experience if it explores more of them, but that will probably ruin the film's thematic focus.<br/><br/>The craft is clearly a masterstroke. Plus the camera sure lingers at the most important points of each scene, and the music score is thankfully no excess for sentimentalism and leaves a big room that fits to the harsher moments, because it legitimately had to be desperate rather than overly dramatic. The stars are also a big landmark here and they've done a lot. Chiwetel Ejiofor credibly rolls with the punches of Northup's hard experiences. The behavior Michael Fassbender gives instantly reveals a hint of backstory to his character. Lupita Nyong'o naturally reflects to what her character has been through. And at the very short screen time of Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt surprisingly provide a strange dash of gravity.<br/><br/>Some might think the ending felt too rushed, or at least found the epilogue less than satisfying, but that is when you realize the real intentions of this movie. Suggestions for more development on the secondary characters could still be asked and it's quite reasonable, but when you see it closely, the real character development it keenly aims is slavery. The film remarkably pinpoints the subject like an arrow, and that is where it triumphs. Although to be warned, watching 12 Years A Slave is never easy, but again so was the context."

It's a story based on true events about a man who is born free and then through horrible circumstances is sold into slavery and for 12 years must makes the decision to survive the cards that he has been dealt. The film is told through the eyes and voice of Solomon Northup. <br/><br/>Solomon Norhtup ( Chiwetel Ejiofor) is born in New York City in 1800's as a free man. He is a skilled musician and craftsman who meets two seemingly nice gentlemen who offer him a job playing his fiddle for a two week engagement in Washington D.C. Solomon accepts their offer and embarks on a journey that will forever change his life. After playing he spends an evening with both gentlemen and has a little too much to drink and can't really remember what happens after that. He soon wakes with the very confusing reality of being chained to a dirty concrete floor when two men walk in and accuse him of being a ""run away"" from Georgia. Solomon professes that he is a free man and his name is Solomon Northup, but they believe him to be Platt, a slave. <br/><br/>Solomon soon finds himself aboard a boat bound for New Orleans in the dead of night. After being beaten several times for his ""lack of respect"" he is soon sold to a plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). We believe Master Ford to be a kind gentleman who soon takes a liking to Solomon and gives him a fiddle. However, Master Ford's plantation manager John Tibeats does not feel the same way.Tibeats and Solomon have a huge fight and Solomon ends up beating Tibeats. Seeking retribution, Tibeats and his friends attempt to hang Solomon. When he is left there for hours until Master Ford can return and cut him down, he tried to plead his case that he is a free man. Knowing that Solomon is not safe at the plantation anymore, Ford transfers the debt and ownership of Solomon to Edwin Epps. <br/><br/>Epps (Michael Fassbender) believes that it is his right to do whatever he chooses to his ""property"" - his plantation, his cotton fields, and his slaves. He beats them, whips them, verbally abuses them, and humiliates them more times than you can count. Epps takes a liking to Patsey ( Lupita Nyong'o ) who is extremely hard working, picking 500 pounds of cotton every day - more than any man. Epps especially likes her late at night when he gets drunk and proceeds to rape Patsey. His wife Mistress Epps (Sarah Paulson) does not take to kindly to this either. Mistress Epps views herself as higher bred than anyone around and has a distinct hate for Patsey, whom she abuses by throwing glass bottles and cutting her face. When Patsey takes an unapproved trip to get soap to wash with from Mistress Epps she suffers a lashing so brutal it is extremely hard to watch on screen. <br/><br/>Solomon begins to build a gazebo with a Canadian laborer named Bass (Brad Pitt) who believes everything is wrong with slavery. Bass gives a rather compelling argument that slaves are not property that they are people, God's people, and there will be a reckoning and price to pay when actions must be accounted for. When Solomon finds himself alone he is convinced by Bass to tell his story. Solomon makes one last effort to ask for help to write back to the north and ask for someone that can verify that he is indeed a free man. Bass tells Solomon the he is fearful of the consequences if he writes this letter, but also knows that it is his duty to do what he can. <br/><br/>To see how Solomon's story turns out you'll have to go see the film. I encourage you to do so while it's still in theaters. The performances are amazing. Michael Fassbender and Chiwetel Ejiofor deliver in every respect and the rest of the cast is truly brilliant. It is an epically heartbreaking story of ones man's journey and courage to not just survive, but in fact to live."

","The movie which won Oscar for the best picture, is certainly the best picture for the year. Having watched all the nominated movies for Best director category, the academy should've given award to Steve McQueen too for this emotional pre-Civil war movie, IMO. Still the academy awarded the movie for the awesome screenplay. Lupita (the girl who won Oscar for the supporting actress), was too good esp. with the sobbing and torture scenes (made me cry almost). I detested Tarantino's Django, but now I feel like I may like it after seeing this.<br/><br/>Somehow I could relate this movie to an Indian (Tamil language) movie named Paradisi released in earlier 2013. Both of these movies deals with slavery and the protagonist falling into it (not by his own will). In Both, the protagonist is separated from his wife and children without their knowledge. Since I am an Indian and have seen the regional movie before this. So I couldn't give it a full 10/10.<br/><br/>Bottom line : A must-see movie. Not for kids for torture and nude scenes. Not for sensitive audiences too."
"cathalryan99","9","4","7","25 February 2014"," A harrowing, powerful film
","""12 Years a Slave"" is harrowing, heart-breaking film, centered around the true, distressing story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man in America, who is sold into slavery. Northup is an honourable, intelligent family man, living in New York State in 1841. Well-renowned for his musical skills, he is kidnapped by two men. They drug him and he is then sent on a boat to the American South, wherein slavery is legal and these kidnappings were apparently common. Northup is sold though this black market slave trade and is given a new Name ""Platt"". He is sold first to plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who seems relatively benevolent despite his status as a slave owner. He is later sold to another slave owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).<br/><br/>The film is brutally blunt with its portrayal of slavery. It is difficult to grasp in modern society that these were people sold and traded like objects or animals, and this film takes absolutely no compromises in its portrayal of the horrific nature of slavery. A fine example of this is the scene in which Northup is lynched. While it is certainly shocking to see a man being almost killed by these white men, the background of this scene is what stood out for me. While the man is being tortured, children are playing, men are at work: This kind of torture is normal for them to see. That in itself, is what makes this scene incredible.<br/><br/>The movie shows a clear transition in this man, Solomon Northup from being an educated, respectable man into becoming a simple slave, or to his slave name ""Platt"". There are two key symbols in the film that I believe represent this. The first is Northup's violin. While Northup is a man in Saratoga, New York, he is an accomplished violinist. This is a certain sign of Northup's education and his freedom; no slave would be able to play a violin. While in William Ford's plantation, Northup is given a violin as a sign of gratitude from Ford. This is almost his last grasp onto his former education and class. Later in the film, after having experienced the horrors of slavery for quite some time, he smashes the violin. This could be considered to be him destroying what was left of his past life as Solomon Northup, a free man from New York to his slave alter-ego ""Platt"". The second example of this transition is the songs sung by the other slaves at the plantations Northup was in. In earlier times in his slave life, Northup was an outsider to the songs sung by the other slaves. Northup's outsider status is obvious, he has been educated, he is a free man, he is not like the others who have been slaves for years, if not their entire life. However, following the death of a fellow slave, within his utter sorrow, begins to sing lowly with the rest, and then loudly. This shows that he has given up and accepted his status as a slave.<br/><br/>The film has been released following the release of several other movies set in mid-1800s America, which revolve around slavery, such as Django: Unchained and Lincoln (both released in 2012). ""12 Years a Slave"", however is unlike these films in its approach to slavery. Beyond few scenes, the other films simply talk about the horrors of slavery, rarely showing them. ""12 Years a Slave"" deals with the issue of slavery with clear, blunt images on the true tragedy that slavery was. For dealing with the issue of slavery as well as it did, the film certainly deserves credit."

","12 years a Slave, an unflinching account of a free black man in the antebellum North who is abducted and sold into slavery in the Deep South, is a brilliant adaptation, a real work of art by auteur Steve McQueen. It's brutally forthcoming and neither panders to its audience nor glosses over the evil that men (and women) do. It features an transcendent performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor as the lead, nearly matched by Michael Fassbender, as an exceptionally cruel slaveowner.<br/><br/>The story opens in Saratoga Springs, New York. Solomon Northrup (Ejiofor) has just seen his wife and two children off on a trip. While walking across the town square, Solomon meets a couple of men who wish for Solomon to play violin for their circus. He travels with them down to Washington, DC and wines and dines with the gentlemen in celebration of Solomon's contribution to the entertainment. But Solomon becomes ill and is put to bed by the men; in the morning, he finds himself in a slave pen, unable to produce papers that would prove him to be a free man.<br/><br/>Solomon is acquired by a slave trader named, ironically, Freeman (Paul Giamatti), who in turns sells Solomon and others to a landowner named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) down in Georgia. Solomon's name is now Platt, and his odyssey proceeds through several owners, some meaner than others, but none quite capable for seeing him as the human being he is. Solomon witnesses many evils, including torture, rape, and murder for even the smallest slights against white people and finds that even to survive he cannot count on any help, inside or out.<br/><br/>This is not an easy movie to watch. It's not just about shining a light on of the most morally deplorable times in our nation's brief history; it's about getting inside the head of a trapped man, a man desperate to return to his loving family but beset on all sides by incoherent rage and inhumanity. As Solomon himself puts it, ""I don't want to survive. I want to live.""<br/><br/>Ejiofor is terrific. When Solomon feels pain, physical or emotional, we feel his pain as well, through Ejiofor's heart-breaking, commanding performance. Solomon's attitude transforms him from a this-must-be-a- mistake nonbeliever trying to convince people he is indeed a legally free man to a defiant, determined, and desperate sojourner. It's a remarkable piece of work by Ejiofor, who had his first break into movies with Steven Spielberg's Amistad - also with slavery as its main theme.<br/><br/>McQueen has assembled a profoundly talented cast to back him up. As the worst villain in the lot, Fassbender (as slaveowner Epps) is more than just convincing - you half expect to learn that Fassbender is a true Southern boy rather than being German born - he is also spellbinding as the horrid Epps, a man even nastier than Leonardo DiCaprio's vaunted Calvin Candie from Django Unchained. Candie was a smirking frat boy compared with Edwin Epps, a man who delights in using his slaves for whatever he wishes, punishing them when they don't pick enough in his cotton fields, favoring one as a plaything even over his own wife (Sarah Paulson). <br/><br/>One aspect I really liked about this movie was that it never paints any white person as the savior of the black protagonist. Never. How many movies have we seen about slavery and civil rights in which some white person deigns to help the black people and is thus their hero? It's not so here. The closest is Cumberbatch's Ford, but even then the landowner would rather save his skin than form a connection with Solomon (or hear that Solomon is actually a free man). There is no help to be found from kindly white folks here. (Aside - okay, there is, right near the end, but it's apparently true to Solomon's experiences and does not make up for the years of agony that Solomon experienced before running into said white person by chance.) A lesser movie may have tried to shoehorn in a ray of hope for Solomon Northrup in a half-baked attempt to reach a wider audience, but thankfully that didn't happen here. <br/><br/>This isn't a popcorn movie, and it's probably not a date movie. It's intellectual and brutish, realistic, believable, painful, and astonishing. It's clearly one of the best of the year and of the careers of McQueen, Ejiofor, and Fassbender."

","There are things to like here for sure but I doubt this rates in my top three all-time black slavery movies ...<br/><br/>A stellar cast but mediocre screenplay/script leave this as an average watch and I'm not sure what this adds to the (ever increasing) back catalogue of black slavery movies ...<br/><br/>The main problem for me I think is that Patsey (a young female black slave who is whipped to within an inch of her life and repeatedly sexually assaulted by her owner and then picked on/assaulted by the owner's jealous wife, again, repeatedly) goes through 1000x more pain, humiliation and suffering than the main character does and she's left behind for more of the same no doubt until her dying day whilst he's back in New York having been freed to go back to his spoilt bunny lifestyle - where's the narrative drama there? All I cared about was Patsey who he, apparently, left to suffer until her dying day even after she begged him to kill her ...<br/><br/>PS: Brad Pitt's role towards the end of the movie was really offputting - sorry Brad but you can't be who/what you are and just turn up at the end of the film and not expect to throw the whole thing off-kilter, Fassbender must have been really p*ssed cos there's really no point even trying to do anything with your own performance if you're then going to roll in at the end with your Quaker beard and being Brad Pitt n all and tossing the audience's immersion out of the window - you're like one step away from being Troy McLure my friend, even if you are ""producing"" the movie ..."
"Kane20","9","4","7","26 November 2013"," Powerful and harrowing
","Alright, imagine if you are living an ordinary day; and then the next suddenly you find your life torn away from you, and you are thrown into a different life, full of misery, despair, oppression, and brutality, possibly for many years. Well, this is exactly what happened to Solomon Northup, a free black man who, in 1841, was kidnapped, beaten, and sold into slavery. And he remained in slavery for twelve years, until he has rescued in 1853 from a plantation he was working on in Louisiana. In fact, Northup only one of the numerous people to whom this actually happened, but he was one of the only ones who regained their freedom.<br/><br/>Shortly after regaining his freedom, he published his story in a book titled 12 Years a Slave, which I read prior to seeing the film, and which director Steve McQueen has now adapted into said film, with the same title. Many reviewers have already summarized essentially how I personally feel about this film, so I apologize if this review feels redundant to you readers. Rather than just trying to grab money and capitalize on the market, McQueen brings to the screen an honest, accurate portrayal of the harsh conditions and life of slavery. And it old through the eyes of a man who was not born and raised as a slave, but a free end educated man who ended up having experience in both the slave and free worlds. As for the cruelty and brutality, the film doesn't tone any of it down. In fact, some scenes were difficult to watch, they were so disturbing. This film actually allowed me, to a considerable extent, to experience a bit of antebellum Southern United States slavery as it actually was. IT could also be argued that the film offers a strong view of how cruel and evil humans can be, and have been at times in the past.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are excellent. The script doesn't give Northup much ""development,"" but Chiwetel Ejiofor gives his character depth and humanity through his powerful, superlative performance. He reached out grabbed by emotions strongly, pulling me into his experiences, from a free man, to his abduction, and through his experience as a slave, during which he kept the fact of his freedom mostly silent but nevertheless remained determined to someday get it back. I especially liked the way he conveyed so much emotion though facial expressions, and especially through his eyes. I predict an Oscar nomination for Ejiofor.<br/><br/>All of the other performances were highly commendable as well. Not all of the white people portrayed in the film, however, are cruel. A counter example is William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). Cumberbatch's character in the film is a 180 turn around from his performance as the evil and menacing Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness. His character, Ford, while blinded by the social and cultural mores of the antebellum South, treats Northup with unexpected kindness (and I look forward to future performances by Cumberbatch). Another such counterexample to the common white cruelty of the time is Bass (Brad Pitt), who eventually helps Northup to escape. As for the not-so-kind people, there are two who reflect the general beliefs and unpleasantness of many southern whites. They are Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a plantation owner and one of Northup's owners, and John Tibeats (Paul Dano), a worker for Ford. And yes, Fassbender and Dano's performed well.<br/><br/>While scenery is certainly not the primary draw of the film, I want to give a thumbs up for the film's cinematography and visual aspects, and Hans Zimmer's music score, which helped enhance the experience. As for the screenplay, John Ridley did a good job adapting the book into a screenplay. He did make a few minor tweaks and condensed the story a bit - in fact, there are one or two particular scenes that I think should have been included in the film, and I think that they would have made the film even better - but other than that the film is true to the book and the events.<br/><br/>If I were to criticize anything about the film, it would be that I really think that the feeling of twelve years passing, while effective, should have been stronger. In fact, while I liked the film and the way everything was handled in it, I felt that everything could still have been stronger - more intense, more vivid, more horrifying, more suspenseful, more gut-wrenching, more emotionally powerful, etc. But again, all of these aspects, and more, were still pretty strong in the film.<br/><br/>So, overall, 12 Years a Slave wasn't great like I wanted it to be, but it was good, and one of the best films of 2013; and it is an experience that I will not be forgetting anytime soon. Solomon Northup himself would have been proud of this film.<br/><br/>My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)"
"andy-933-696608","9","4","7","25 November 2013"," I will not give in to despair.
","Steve McQueen's previous work, Hunger, and Shame, both demonstrated his ability to create films that capture a unique rawness most films rarely show. The characters are never portrayed within a black and white context of this person being good or bad. The world McQueen often portrays in each of his films, although different within each approach has that authenticity that places him within the same intellectual status of filmmakers as daring as Paul Thomas Anderson and Nicolas Winding Refn. Although 12 Years a Slave's trailer, within its presentation gives an inspirational feeling of glory, that is merely a delusion. The story of Solomon Northrup is tragic and brutal, the film depiction of it is real enough to belittle and discourage the concept of hope most people will attempt to draw in the turmoil of such unabridged suffering.<br/><br/>Born a freeman and prosperous with a family, Solomon Northrup's (Ejiofor) story is played out within the twelve year period of his enslavement, as he is lured into what was believed to be a promising business deal. Being skilled with the fiddle, Northrup was invited to Washington D.C. to play for a pair of white gentlemen, trusting completely and never suspecting the treachery they bestowed upon the kindness and gratitude he expressed. Drugged and bedridden, Solomon awakens in a pair of chains, claiming his status as free, only to be beaten and humiliated as though he were more of a beast than a person.<br/><br/>Not long after an uncensored and grotesque torture scene, Solomon is sold as Platt, from one slave owner onto another. Beginning with the Baptist preacher William Ford (Cumberbatch), Solomon survives with what straightforward modesty among the kindness he sees in this current master, hoping that his generosity can deliver him the hope of seeing his family once more. After a few bouts with Ford's jealous and equally uneducated carpenter, Tibets (Dano), Solomon is sent to work for another master. Despite his pleas for Ford to see his innocence, little does it do him for that hope will soon disappear through the brutal hatred that slavery had inspired in many American's as they justified the prospect of human beings as property. Be it through scientific or divine principles.<br/><br/>The determination that Michael Fassbender exemplifies within Edwin Epps, is both brilliant and equally despicable to feel repulsion. Hateful, snide, racist, and even rarely kind enough to find intriguing in his malicious nature. Solomon's purity stands the many obstacles thrown at him. A young girl named Patsey (Nyong'o) becomes the subject of suffering as she embodies the object of Epp's sexual desires, and the focus of his wife's hatred. Sarah Paulson's calm and almost puppet like expression captures an appalling apathy of despair as she demonstrates a more silent, but inhumane brutality among Patsey. In fact, the portrayal of torture in this film is shown to the authentic extent that it does not hide one essence of its straightforward depiction. The scenes are long, and edited to the degree that McQueen wants nothing more but to show audiences what he feels is an honest and direct approach to telling the story of Northrups survival.<br/><br/>Sadly, survival does not come easy, nor does it often seem possible. If anything the story told here is never given an inspirational standards of positivity. The close-up shots of the character's faces embody both their despair as well as their desire for hope. Even after their fellow brother or sister has had the earth closed upon them do they tearfully sing in the hope for a better end. It really is sad to say that these raw scenes are merely shown as they are meant to be, giving no hope of the sort. The conclusion of the story is known through the written history of Northrup's memoir ""Twelve Years a Slave"", and upon reuniting with his family, the moment is presented with more tragedy than relief. The final endnotes give little indication of justice, as Northrup fails to punish those who condemned him to what many slaves would consider eternal punishment, and his own whereabouts remain a mystery.<br/><br/>Twelve Years a Slave is both powerful and moving. Although it forsakes any inspirational themes in its technique, it really focuses that primarily within the performance Chiwetel Ejiofor gives when capturing the sadness and the determination of this forsaken individual. An equal amount of praise can be given to the dark and evil depiction Fassbender delivers in what is for me his first menacing role. The direction of this film is never dull, nor does it give you the idea of a meaninglessness, although a lot else should be said for the suffering many slaves had endured during the trial now being labeled ""America's Holocaust"". A period piece in its own historical standard, and a drama, Twelve Years a Slave is both sad, but amazing in the daring vision that McQueen tackles, never holding back, nor even dumbing it down to more sensitive viewers. The film through its authentic tone of brutality manages to penetrate the more conventional American Slavery drama. It does not over exaggerate within the conception of the characters, nor does it hesitate to portray them as stereotypes. It simply brings out both the good and the bad qualities that shape them, thus giving this film a rare and challenging aura that further elevates the potential Steve McQueen embodies as a film maker."
"jkbonner1","10","4","7","15 November 2013"," An amazing movie
","Toward the end of the movie Platt, a field slave, reveals his story to an itinerant carpenter, Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt in a cameo role), who remarks ""you have an amazing story to tell, but it's not pleasant."" For ""Platt"" is Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a legally freed man from New York state. Platt is his a slave name literally beaten into him after his kidnapping in Washington City in 1841. Kept chained and beaten in a slave pen in Washington City, he and other kidnapped blacks are shipped to New Orleans and sold in slavery.<br/><br/>Platt lives a life of horror. A horror so horrendous and unrelenting it's ""amazing."" 12 Years A Slave frequently uses the n-word and this adds immensely to its truthfulness and accuracy. Many whites in the South considered blacks subhuman, hence keeping them as slaves was not only acceptable, it was supported by the Bible, or at least their twisted interpretation of it.<br/><br/>Some of the slavers (wealthy, privileged plantation owners who formed the backbone of the ante-bellum South) were reasonably decent men: Ford, Judge Turner. But the slavery system made the slavers wealthy men and they all bought into the economic system that made them rich and prosperous. And their white underlings were savagely racist to the core. It's a fact the less fortunate ape the wealthy. Look around today. That behavior's still out there in spades. The wealthy do it and ten years later everyone wants to do it, or at least wish they could do it. And with our Twitters and Facebooks it doesn't even take ten years anymore. A celebrity does it today and ten seconds later everyone wants to do it.<br/><br/>Northup tries to keep up hope but finally is full of despair, signified by his watching the last embers of a letter he intended to send to his wife but instead burned and also by the purposeful destruction of his violin. He's afraid to even trust a white man. It's only Bass's outspoken abolitionist opinions that make Northup trust him. And it's through Bass's help that Solomon Northup is finally freed from the total hellhole on Earth that was Edwin Epps's plantation. I found myself wondering what happened to all those poor, desperate people that he left behind.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is superb. In particular Chiwetel Ejiofor stands out as Solomon Northup/Platt and the sufferings he endures day after day. Michael Fassbender does an outstanding job portraying Edwin Epps the sad, sadistic, paranoid, megalomaniac, depraved human being whose humanity still comes through. And every other actor plays their part to a tee. The scenery, costumes, and settings were absolutely fantastic. From capturing Washington City in 1841 to the large plantations in the Deep South, Steve McQueen and his crew recreated a totally convincing ante-bellum South in minute detail. I certainly hope this movie garners a bunch of Academy Awards this coming February. It richly deserves them.<br/><br/>On a philosophical level the movie broaches slavery as an institution. Should human beings be sold to other human beings as chattel? Anthropological evidence suggests hunter-gatherers probably didn't indulge in it much. But every civilization in existence from 3000 BC onward had either slaves outright or those that were one step up (serfs). The late anthropologist-philosopher, Ernest Gellner, called the people who claw their way to the top of a society either by force or by chicanery, the thugs. And there are still plenty of thugs around. Someone has to do society's dirty work. And so the slave trade came into existence. And there are still slaves around too. People who are forced into indebted servitude against their will where their chances of escaping are virtually nil.<br/><br/>To wrap up, a truly gripping and powerful movie, but definitely not for those who prefer to avoid the realities of life and who like nice, cheery, feel-good stories. Not for those either who like blow-'em-ups/ shoot-'em-ups. Many of the scenes are very brutal and very intense.<br/><br/>This movie will make you ponder in depth the inhumanity and abject cruelty some humans do to other humans. And it's still going on out there in spades in many parts of the world. Maybe this movie will make us think more deeply how it might be stopped. I sure hope so."
"howard.schumann","9","4","7","10 November 2013"," A riveting experience
","Co-produced by Brad Pitt and written by John Ridley, Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave is based on the 1853 memoir of Solomon Northrup, a free black man who lived in Saratoga Springs, New York and was kidnapped in 1841 and sold into slavery in the South which he endured for twelve long years. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northrup does not simply relate his story but makes us party to his experience and we feel the lashes as if they were welts on our own back. The film opens with Solomon as a slave cutting sugar cane on a large plantation. It then flashes back to a happier time in New York where he is a violinist, living quite comfortably with his wife and children.<br/><br/>Always eager to improve his means, he accepts a job from two nattily dressed white men to play violin in a traveling circus. After a night of good food and good drink in a Washington, DC restaurant, however, Solomon wakes up the next morning in chains and learns that he has been sold as a slave and transported to New Orleans. While he experiences physical pain, the emotional pain of separation from his wife and children is even more devastating.<br/><br/>After a cynical trafficker (Paul Giamatti) auctions his naked ""products,"" Solomon, now renamed Platt, is transported to a plantation in central Louisiana where he and Eliza (Adepero Oduye), a young mother cruelly separated from her two children, are sold to William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), the only slaveowner in the film depicted with a modicum of humanity. When Platt retaliates against the sadistic overseer, John Tibeats (Paul Dano), however, he is hung from a tree on a rope where he remains for hours while other field hands ignore him and go about their business and only escapes death when Ford returns and cuts him down.<br/><br/>Ford, however, is forced to liquidate his debts and sells him to the sadistic and hypocritical Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), who lashes slaves if they fail to meet the quota of the day picking cotton or just to assert his authority, yet sleeps with the most productive field slave, Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o in a shattering performance. Their relationship is known to his wife (Sarah Paulson) and, because of her jealousy and Edwin's guilt, Patsey suffers more than others. In a scene that will be talked about for a long time, Platt is forced at gunpoint to whip Patsey, a whipping that continues for what seems an obscene length of time.<br/><br/>If we were able to reassure ourselves up to that point that it is only a movie, the moment we hear the thunderous lash of the whip against Patsey's back over and over again, we know that there is no comforting escape mechanism. Though Platt never despairs, it is only when a traveling white carpenter (Brad Pitt) from Canada with strong abolitionist views hears his story that the look in his eye turns from resignation to a glimmer of hope. Though slavery was part of a worldwide system of economic exploitation, 12 Years a Slave is not about slavery as an institution. This is Northrup's story and if you think it is filled with exaggerated stereotypes, consider Northrup's own words: ""I can speak of slavery only so far as it came under my own observation"", he explains, ""only so far as I have known and experienced it in my own person. My object is, to give a candid and truthful statement of facts: to repeat the story of my life, without exaggeration, leaving it for others to determine, whether even the pages and fiction present a picture of more cruel wrong or a severer bondage."" Though Platt, like the others, is a victim, Ejiofor's moving performance so strongly enlists our support that we encompass his perseverance, dignity, and relentless struggle for his humanity as part of our own fight to be who we really are and to express it with love and without fear.<br/><br/>While 12 Years a Slave can be overwhelming, it is a welcome history lesson that films have heretofore neglected to tell, one that dispels the myth of the happy slave and the benevolent master. A riveting experience that conveys the agony of what it's like to endure the debasement of one's essential humanity, it is not pretty but, then again, the truth often isn't. I don't know if I will ever want to see it again, but I am certain I will not soon forget it."

","Whilst the story of the main protagonist is a tragic one this story far from lives up to it's billing. You can tell the Oscar circus will soon be in town. Yes this is a tragic and appalling story but no more so than that of any other slave. A free man taken as a slave! Well forgive me but weren't all the slaves free men before they were taken? There have been many many movies on slavery over the years and imo this is not one of the best but the Oscar spin machine is in full overdrive banging on about this movie. However that being said I have come to understand that my views quite often differ from the general populous but this film is long and boring and doesn't tell a particularly gripping or entertaining story, far from conveying the horror of slavery this portrayal seems to show the protagonist living a life far better than other slaves that have had their stories told. This year Hollywood seems to have produced the most drawn out boring movies for decades. The desolation of Snores is another one on the list. 1 BOOK 1 FILM JACKSON YOU'VE RUINED IT!!!.

But it felt as though it were shot in real time. The movie depicts day after day after day of misery. The other reviewers seem to think it was a good movie because of how it represents man's horrific behavior. But that doesn't mean it's a good film. It's a good depiction of how rotten people can be, not good cinema and Lord knows, it's not entertaining.<br/><br/>It also seems interesting that there are claims made that we haven't seen anything like this before. We just saw a nearly identical lashing- to-a-post-and-being-whipped in last year's CLOUD ATLAS. <br/><br/>A good example of this time period being represented artistically is Toni Morrison's book BELOVED. A simple visual representation of cruelty is not art."
"dhsmith","3","5","10","24 March 2014"," 12 Years a slave, typical inaccurate stereotype of southern cruelty of slaves
","I was hoping this movie would have some redeeming qualities and not just like every movie that depicts whitey as a brutal, cruel, and demeaning, stereotypical southern slave owner. This movie was just one cruel treatment followed by another, then another, then another, and then another. I understand that there was some of this going on but just think of the millions who watch this think this movie is what happened to the majority of slaves. I saw no creativity or originality or anything that would make this movie special.<br/><br/>As a southerner I was hoping to see this subject matter handled with some balance and saw none. To say this was bad guys wearing the black hats is an injustice to what was a dark time for America but this treatment of this highly sensitive issue was heavy handed with no objectivity at all. This is no way to offer a docudrama as fact when it represented a myopic vision to a much more complex issue. I just hope those who see this movie and not prejudiced by Steve McQueen's poor handling of this time in history."
"nextofkin82","6","5","10","2 March 2014"," I was disappointed
","I must be one of the only ones who didn't love this film. As with The Wolf of Wall Street, i found it rather uninvolving and dull. To get to the reason why, here are two questions: Two questions for you dear reader (and those who have seen this film). 1. What did new things you learn about slavery because of this film? My answer is quite a few things (that free people were kidnapped into slavery, how they were sold, how they lived, how they were gagged, etc.) Maybe not revolutionary things but still. 2. Describe to me what you learned about the lead character? My answer would be: he's a educated man who loves his family and can play the violin. That's it. This, to me, is the major flaw of this film. I don't know this man. What does he think? What are his doubts? Why don't we see him do anything to try to get out or how he plans to survive this ordeal? Why does he try to run away so late into his plight? Why not try again? And most important: what 'arc' did he have? How did he change because of what happened to him? Did he learn anything? Did he grow? Did he change (for better or worse)? It's a classical approach to storytelling that goes back to the old Greeks for a reason. If a character doesn't dramatically change, there is no point for the drama. I respect the film and what it tries to do. But i never got emotionally involved/invested (because of point 2) and that made it a bit boring to me and quite disappointing."
"ZeeRaaN","6","5","10","30 January 2014"," It felt like one month of whipping
","This movie is about a man who was kidnapped into slavery for 12 years, yet you don't really feel the 12 years, it felt like everything happened in one time frame of a month or so.<br/><br/>a perfect movie should take the audience into an emotional journey of happiness, sadness, laughter, awkwardness...etc. Steve McQueen the director did not succeed, in my opinion, to take us into this journey with him. it was sad all the time and depressing. <br/><br/>I understand he wanted to stay true to the story, but this movie was too true, almost like reading a diary from the 18th century. I think an Oscar nominee director should find a way to make a one dimensional story more interesting, because one thing for sure, I was bored a lot. the whole focus on the movie was on the ""slaves"" being whipped and why. it was all about random situations which caused the mean ""master"" to whip the ""slaves"".there was no focus on other aspects of this horrible 12 years. (**SPOILER ALERT** like for example, in the scene where Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was finally rescued, Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) came and hugged him so tight and he hugged her too. I asked my self but why!! when did they become good friends!! did i miss something!! he even whipped her and refused to help her - when she asked him to kill her in an act of mercy- by turning his back on her (literally) and did not even calm her down or talk to her. so when did this friendship happen!! this is only one example of how this movie was one dimensional and only focused on whipping).<br/><br/>This movie is not a bad movie for sure, but i think it had so much potential and the director did not take advantage. and i think it was over-rated.<br/><br/>on the bright side, I liked how the characters were diverse, good white people and bad ones. also the songs they were singing as a group added a little bit of a fun flavor to the movie."

","Mankind has come a long way from just being another mammal to the self-proclaimed masters of the planet. But the one thing that has continued to accompany us throughout the course of our evolution has been our inhuman desire to submit others to our will. Slavery has existed since the dawn of man & continues to exist even today in all forms; be it forced labour, human trafficking or debt bondage. 12 Years A Slave takes us back to the days America is ashamed of & tells the story of Solomon Northup; a free-born Negro & skilled violinist living with his family in New York who, on the pretext of making more money, was brought to Washington D.C. in 1841 and was later deceived, kidnapped & sold into slavery.<br/><br/>While narrating Solomon's plight from his bondage to his eventual release over a decade later, this film also paints a viciously devastating portrait of American slavery & isn't going to be an easy sit for everyone. Unflinchingly scripted by John Ridley & excellently directed by Steve McQueen who leaves no stone unturned to prove that slavery is the lowest form of how one human can exploit another, steadily photographed, sensibly edited, calmly scored & outstandingly well performed by a strong cast of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender & others, and each one of them have contributed greatly in delivering the year's strongest ensemble performance.<br/><br/>Leading from the front is Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup in what is certainly a career- defining work that deserves all the praise it has garnered so far & more. Supporting him remarkably well are Lupita Nyong'o & Michael Fassbender and even the small cameos by Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano & Brad Pitt end up making a mark in this film. On an overall scale, 12 Years A Slave is an emotionally scarring cinema about one of the most barbaric events in mankind history and benefits greatly from McQueen's bold direction, unflinching script, historical accuracy & strong performances from its highly talented cast. There are always some films out there which deserve to be seen no matter how disturbing or upsetting their experience could be and 12 Years A Slave is definitely one of them. Strongly recommended.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"
"martinrobertson300482","10","5","10","19 January 2014"," A stand out film
","Another movie likely to clear up at the Oscars this year. And a movie that I wanted to see either way because of some of the actors involved. ""12 years a slave"" has spawned such quotes as ""One of the best films ever made,"" and ""This film is truly history in the making,"" and all I can say after seeing the movie, is that a lot of this praise is well justified,.<br/><br/>The Film starts with the fact that its exploring a side to 1800's American slavery that many wouldn't think about. And that's that free black men from the time were kidnapped, and put amongst slaves just like any others. This gives the film a different side, in that you can actually route for Chiwetel Ejiofors escape, as he has a proper family and nice life to get back too. But Its the true to how it was nature of ""12 years a slave"" that makes it a stand out film.<br/><br/>If you except that there will be no popcorn movie ""justice"" or ""pay back"" in the movie, you will love it. If your wanting a movie where the Slave fights back and wins, go and watch ""Django unchained."" This is a true tragedy. Educating its viewers on how bleak these times really were.<br/><br/>Like any true life movie, destine to become a classic. A lot of it is down to the performances, and with the likes of Michael Fassbender, Benidict Cumberbatch, Paul Ciamatti and Paul Dano in the flick. You pretty much cant go wrong. The Star though, is Chiwetel Ejiofor. and he and his fellow slaves are what give the film its tragic heart. Even if its likely Michael Fassbender (an actor who's long over due an Oscar) that will be overall remembered as the despicable ""villain"" of the movie."

","What strikes me about Steve McQueen is, he always seems to get me begging for more, his films are mesmerising and transport you into the unimaginable world of the protagonist. <br/><br/>12 Years a Slave was riddled with superb writing and excellent directing; every aspect of the film, every part of the story, every character introduced was so compatible. It was hard to watch, because I felt as though I was obliged to help the Solomon because I was drawn in so deep. And to watch him descend from this respected, attentive man to a , as they would say,a 'thick lipped cotton picker nig**r', was very powerful and upsetting to see. There's nothing I love more than feeling true sadness for a character, and this just pulled the plug for me. Great, great, great. I'm so glad I spent money to see this film, it deserves every award it was nominated for."
"sahamh","9","5","10","9 January 2014"," Fantastic Film
","The title of the movie summarizes the story; I only can add violin player, Solomon Northup, is a freeman but being kidnapped and sold to slavery. So the story is very clear how it's going to be and automatically audience should expect some torture scenes, and in my opinion director Steve McQueen does a great job showing them on screen. Although, these scenes aren't sadly painful for me to watch due the violence in movies in the past few years, but what personally destroys me the most and difficult to watch is the fact someone is being tortured or being in a very difficult situation and others are careless or incapable or even coward to offer a small simple help – in my opinion, when something like that happens there's a massive problem in that society. This film most likely is slow for some audiences, I think it's only a few minutes longer than 2 hours, but I remember after the movies was done, in theater some people were saying ""gosh it was long."" Let me tell you this, you shouldn't expect every shot or scene to move the story forward, they are there to capture the feeling of that environment and the emotions of the characters. Again, Steve McQueen does such solid job on showing them on screen, a good example of it is when a difficult scene occurs next to a pig farm, and you see how a human is being valued less than them. That also brings me to praise the cinematographer, Sean Bobbit, because he's done an astonishing job here, absolutely beautiful images and they're so well framed (especially those long shots), and also so well colorized, which I personally love it a lot- I love it when a dark theme story like this has a lot of colorful images on screen. Another element that Steve McQueen has done perfectly is the cast, this is the best ensemble on screen that I've seen, everyone brings wonderful performances, no one disappoints at all, and indeed Chiwetel Ejiofor deserves an Oscar nomination. Also about Michael Fassbender, the guy is just a fantastic actor and his performance here is flawless, but I'd like to talk about his character. I assume people who have seen the trailer automatically expect a brutal, menacing character, but I don't see him that way at all. I see Edwin Epps a weak person who is being controlled by his wife, I see a fool who has a power and extremely abuses it. Sarah Paulson as Mistress Epps is wonderful and surprising in this role, she's the cold person with no mercy, she's the menacing person, and honestly she's the true master of that plantation. Regarding the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer does a decent job here; I personally feel the score is the renovations of a track he did for Inception, ""Time,"" which I personally have no problem with it, some might get disappointed, but I think it fits the theme.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this to everyone, especially teenagers who avoid learning anything about history and their past. I find it sad that American critics are not happy that a British director made this film, I think they should be unhappy about that their country is attempting to avoid their dark and brutal history that didn't happen not too far ago and accusing other nations for being uncivilized – in my opinion, if the holocaust wouldn't have happened, the slavery and the segregation in this country would have been the worst event in the history of the past couple ages. Anyway, I give this 9/10."
"E Canuck","Null","5","10","7 January 2014"," A tough watch that's worth watching
","Just returned home from seeing 12 Years a Slave with a friend, and this is one of those powerful movies that has me thinking about the film, the real story on which it was based, as though it were an event in my own life. If Steve McQueen directed no other film but this one his reputation as a director would be notable (I'm not familiar with his other films.) <br/><br/>The hook of the story is that Solomon is not just ""another"" slave—he's a kidnapped free man from the North, shipped to southern plantation life to line someone's pocket. By the time the film is over, you realize, it's a horror for human society that it takes a special case to draw us to this story and to witnessing the wretched immorality of slavery, when every case is equally wretched and hellacious—regardless of the birth or status of those made slaves. The moral wasting of those who enslave them is a full element of the piece.<br/><br/>12 Years has the effect of making the audience feel as though we have been made captive along with Solomon. It's never prettified or softened and the ugly self-serving rationalizing of slave economies, slave masters and mistresses is omnipresent in the film. The horrors are bearable because we know Solomon must survive or his book of the same title as the film wouldn't have been written and his story told. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt as producer cast himself in an unglamourous but positive role in the film—one of the few white characters to act honourably.<br/><br/>See it with company, not alone. Just as with Solomon, we want a little less solitude to go through this."
"drazsika-716-814820","10","5","10","7 January 2014"," Great movie about a very important subject
","12 years a slave allows you to take a good look at the until-today somewhat taboo topic of slavery and life of slaves in the United States of the 1800s. The movie takes many positive elements of Hollywood movie-making like excellent shots, camera angles, colours and music while borrows literary conversations from a narrative novel of the same title from the 1800s and shows you professional acting with many long, close shots of the actor's faces. The movie is easily watchable but is of a great depth and will make you watch scenes when you wanna turn your head and will make you think of an important era that didn't pass without effects on our present times. An undeniable masterpiece that might show the beginning of a new kind of movies made for a broader audience with dramatic depth and historical accuracy."
"Hellmant","10","5","10","14 November 2013"," McQueen has created a cinematic masterpiece and a film that everyone needs to see!
","'12 YEARS A SLAVE': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>'12 YEARS A SLAVE' is now the top contender to win Best Picture (and many other awards) at this year's Oscars. It's about a free black man, named Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841 Washington, D.C.. He spent 12 years working on Louisiana plantations before he was freed. The film is based on the 1853 autobiography, of the same name, by Solomon Northup and was written by John Ridley. It was directed by Steve McQueen and stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong'o, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Sarah Paulson and Brad Pitt (who was also one of the film's producers). The movie deserves all the critical praise and award recognition it's been getting (and will receive) and is definitely one of the year's very best films (and a must see)!<br/><br/>The movie begins in 1841 Saratoga Springs, New York where Solomon Northup (Ejiofor, who's fantastic in the film) works as a carpenter and a very talented violin player. He has a wife (Kelsey Scott) and a young son (Cameron Zeigler) and daughter (Quvenzhané Wallis of 'BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD' fame). One day he meets two men (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) who claim to be touring musicians. They take him out drinking and offer him a high paying gig in their show. Solomon then wakes up to find himself in chains, realizing he had been drugged and sold into slavery. He spends the next twelve years working for two different plantation owners in Louisiana: William Ford (Cumberbatch) and Edwin Epps (Fassbender, who's a scene stealer and starred in McQueen's last two films as well). Northup gets along with Ford but finds himself in many confrontations with the sadistic and extremely abusive Epps. He befriends another younger female slave named Patsy (Nyong'o, who's amazing) who, despite being an excellent worker, is constantly beaten by Edwin and his wife (Paulson), due to the fact that she's the object of Mr. Epps affection (as he constantly rapes her as well).<br/><br/>The movie is extremely depressing and hard to watch (as it should be). It does build to an overwhelmingly emotional and satisfying conclusion though. All the same many will never go near a movie like this (because of it's violent and disturbing content) but it's definitely a movie that everyone (of a certain age) should see (in America at least). Some (of the racist nature) like to complain that movies like this are exploitative and prey on white guilt, making racial relations more difficult (they say). I disagree and think important events in history should never be forgotten or ignored. They should always be examined, and looked back on, despite how painful they might be. This movie bothered me for days (as I couldn't get several scenes from it out of head), it's like a true life historical horror story and the filmmakers did an excellent job of bringing it to life. That's why I think it deserves a perfect rating; because of how powerful and memorable it is (and how much it really sticks with you and affects you, long after it's over). I'd compare it's quality to something like 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' and even say it's a little better. It deals with very similar subject matter; slavery in the US (in the 1840s) was very much like what was going on in Germany (during World War II) with Jewish people (it is an American equivalent of almost the same crimes). You don't hear nearly as many complaints about how movies about the Holocaust are exploitative (when the same type of argument could be made). McQueen has created a cinematic masterpiece (whether some want to acknowledge it or not) and a film that everyone needs to see!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGndm52qI4"
"natalierosen","10","5","10","4 November 2013"," Excellence in Truth
","This weekend I had the grim opportunity to see ""12 Years a Slave"" based on the true story and written work of a free African, Solomon Northup, in 1841. Northup, a great African American violinist and musical talent living as a freeman in the north, gets apprehended by thugs and sent back into slavery in the 1841 south. If one sees that film, which I HIGHLY encourage, and really understands it one will be guaranteed a true perspective on the etiology of our nation's historical white racist albatross. The old Confederacy is dead BUT the white Tea Bag Republican Party is determined to keep its malevolent heart beating and the major Republican Party is more than willing to use these know nothing Tea Baggers to attain power for the rich who so desperately want it.<br/><br/>If one sees this film one will know why, if you do not already, our first African American president is disrespected and pilloried attempting to crush everything he proposes whether his nomination of judges or of his signature legislation the Affordable Healthcare Act by those who wave the Confederate flag proudly and those rich white men within the Republican Party echelons of power who allow these malevolent malcontents within their ranks to exist undeterred.<br/><br/>This film is a window into the American soul. The nation armed with its document of freedom and egalitarian treatment for all can reduce this precious document to refuse. It is impossible to understand how African Americans could even survive the onslaught of a system that degraded and reduced their status to beasts of burden; property that whites could kill or use at will. One sees, through this film, man's inhumanity to man EVEN in a country which purports to know better. The hypocrisy is endless and the cruelty of white masters toward their black property knows no boundaries.<br/><br/>It mattered not whether one was a black man or a black woman as each were treated with unfathomable cruelty in his/her own uniquely vulnerable way. Both sexes endured the lash but the female had to endure the lash and the humiliation of loveless, brutal and savage rape by her white master and could do not a thing about it. It can be said and Todd Aiken who made the preposterous statement that a woman can shut down a pregnancy if she is raped that unequivocally biology knows no difference between impregnation by love or by rape as the many light-skinned blacks of that era could attest. <br/><br/>This is what it is like when men because of who they are have no rights and where other men can lord over them, strip them of rights, strip them of the vote and strip them of the humanity of human dignity based solely on who they were born.<br/><br/>The film has great relevance to our day. Republican whites, as in the era of Jim Crow, try their best to deny, by any means necessary, the vote to those blacks and others who would attempt to vote those into office who would have their interests at heart.<br/><br/>This film instructs us today NOT to let racists within our ranks gain traction and win electorally through rancid policy that which they could not win through a Civil War that crushed them two centuries ago. The Old Confederacy has morphed into a new and ugly monster that will rise again ONLY if we of egalitarian principle let it. WE WILL NOT LET IT RISE AGAIN NOT THIS TIME and take us back as they did Solomon Nothrup to the bestial era of the 1841 south. <br/><br/>They must be roundly defeated not only for persons of color but for all of us including women whose power WILL be nullified by right wing extremists who have only hate and religious dogma in their hearts. They will take us back to the 19th century and even, as one Nevada know nothing legislator said, vote to take us back to slavery if the public wants it. According to the Las Vegas Sun, Jim Wheeler of Gardnerville, NV was speaking to the Storey County Republican Party when he made the remarks. That remark says it all as does the remark in the film of Brad Pitt abolitionist white plantation worker when he says of the corrupt and bestial slave system: ""Thou devil, sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!'"" And so they have but, in my opinion, not nearly enough!"
"venusboys3","7","6","13","23 February 2014"," Well-made but that's about it.
","I don't really understand all the praise this film has been getting. It's not a 'bad' film by any measure... but it doesn't really say anything new, or say anything old in a new way. It's basic message is 'slavery was bad'. That's it. The main character is just a victim and a witness. He doesn't transform or overcome (it's up to a time-traveling white man to save him). He's not particularly admirable or craven... or anything. He's just kind of there, taking in all the cruelty and insanity around him. It would have been far better to have concentrated less on the too-familiar beatings and humiliations and show us more of his life before and after the kidnapping/horrors he endured. As it stands, there's not much context. What is shown of his prior life seems almost ridiculously Utopian (the North was NEVER free of racism) and afterward... well, we don't get much despite some notations that suggest the REAL story might have been his attempts to use the legal system to find justice for the crimes against him. Really, I think the focus of this movie is on the wrong parts of the story... indicting the usual suspects and familiar villains rather than the smug racists in the North who refused to help the man find any real satisfaction."
"ElMaruecan82","10","6","13","17 January 2014"," The perfect response to ""Django Unchained"" ...
","If there ever was one movie that Hollywood owed big time to the Black Community, it is certainly Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"".<br/><br/>Warning ahead, this is not-another-film-about-racism, this is not a fashionably white-guilt-inducing drama, this is not ""The Help"", ""The Butler"" or ""The Color Purple"", ""12 Years a Slave"" is of a league of its own. The movie explores familiar grounds until suddenly bare-handedly digging into the crass that soiled American memory, extracting from it, an experience like so few cinematic experiences. Again, it does look familiar. What we see, we know but it's precisely about knowing what we see: a bold, accurate and gut-wrenching depiction of slavery as a holocaust.<br/><br/>Yes, holocaust. The term seemed to belong exclusively for World War II and till now, whenever uttered, it's Nazi uniforms, swastikas, concentration camps and striped pajamas that come to minds, night and fog, rather than sunshine and cotton fields, German shepherds and rifles rather than trees and ropes  but if there is one certitude that no one should ever deny, not anymore, it is that slavery started through the denial of black people's humanity, a misconception that lasted for centuries, a length unparalleled by no other atrocity whatsoever. Population mass slaughters, slavery, transatlantic trades, all started with the general consensus that black people were born for servitude, the holocaust was moral in the first place.<br/><br/>My exhilaration while watching ""12 Years a Slave"" was governed by an awkward mix of revulsion and satisfaction, each frame was unnerving but in the same time, I was thinking, ""God, that's what eyes must see"", minds know what it is, but eyes have to be affected, have to be inflicted the spectacle of slavery and its intimate rape on innocent souls. Looking in close-up at the effects whipping can have on a poor woman's back, at the blood splattering at each whip, the noise hardly covered by the shrill screams, that instead of a sentimental close-up on a teary eye. The film is still full of tears and close-ups but they never distract from the cruelty reached by slave owners in some particularly upsetting scene.<br/><br/>Of course, the comparison with ""Schindler's List"" is inevitable. Even I, did start the review by mentioning the word 'holocaust', because I believe the film has a profound cathartic effect for a community, allowed to be acknowledged the extents of the brutality they were victim of, something that hasn't been covered that much by film-making. ""Can we get over racism and slavery, it's been 150 years?"" complain some, well, Cinema didn't tackle it enough  can you imagine that a film like ""Django Unchained"" was praised for being one of the first mainstream movies to deal with slavery? This is how Cinema desperately needed a film to make the point ""Django"" didn't make or made badly for the sake of a cheap and pornographic depiction of violence..<br/><br/>Just look at the performance of Di Caprio in ""Django"" he's a suave and distinguished villain à la 'Bill the Butcher' but can anyone who finds him despicable ever put words on Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Master Epps? Fassbender in ""12 Years a Slave"" oozed the kind of vileness I never found on movies since Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List"". But while the Nazis believed Jews were disposable human beings, who could die any time slavers thought they had a biblical right on their slaves, they cherished the idea of owning them, on the plantation field, and Epss' fascination with Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) the most cotton-picker of the plantation, the sensual attraction he feels toward her reveals something much deeper and no less disturbing in the inner psychology lying underneath the surface of slavery: possession.<br/><br/>And the attachment to the notion of possession became the slaves' real chain: they could be beaten, whipped, but not killed, unless they died from exhaustion or lynched. And it is so telling how envied those who die are. Blacks weren't regarded as humans, not even animals, almost like objects, and that makes the whole reality even more difficult to accept. And the documentary-like realism of McQueen's masterpiece was the perfect response to Tarantino's fantasy western-spaghetti. Not to deny Tarantino's right, he used the same plots for a ""Jews vs. Nazis"" story in ""Ingloruious Basterds"" but how many holocaust dramas were already made to fulfill their educational purpose. ""Django"" had to come after ""12 Years a Slave"", only 1 year before is a thin consolation.<br/><br/>I wish I could expose more in this review, than the parallel with World War II holocaust, but this is my genuine reaction. I just read that Steve McQueen felt like reading Anne Frank's diary from Solomon Northup's novel retracing his 12 years of detention as a slave. I wouldn't blame him either for making a film that would play like a 'Black' ""Schindler's List"", especially since the film doesn't suffer from Spielberg's usual flaws. ""12 Years a Slave"" is not sentimental, not Manichean, not cartoonish. As a matter of fact, Whites are not all despicable, for one whip-happy Paul Dano, you have Benedict Cumberbatch as a comprehensive and benevolent master, for one scary Sarah Paulson as Epps' sister, you have Pitt as a Canadian progressive.<br/><br/>Never patronizing, never compromising, the film is all about the fight and struggle of Solomon Northup, magnificently portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, a man profoundly humanist, not as a philosopher, but simple as a man who sees humanity in every color and race, and can't therefore believe what he's going through, a man anachronistically modern, we can all identify with, and this is why his experience is so harrowing, so moving, so penetrating.<br/><br/>Spike Lee said you can't make a western-spaghetti out of slavery because it was a holocaust, at least, the film proves his point right. Steve McQueen did it, finally, screaming what ""The Help"" and even the opening scene of ""The Butler"" (which I look at now with more perplexed eyes) whispered."

Can see though why it has been so well received, while also seeing where those who didn't like it are coming from in their reservations (though not sharing the vitriolic way they've been expressed by some). It may not be perfect, but from personal opinion, and quite a big number of others, it was tremendously powerful and very brave,<br/><br/>'12 Years A Slave' may have some one-sided and conveniently black and white characterisation. It may not say anything new about the subject. <br/><br/>Some of the cast, like Paul Giamatti and Benedict Cumberbatch (though they are excellent still), are underused. And Brad Pitt and his dialogue did feel out of place and the dialogue additionally coming over as heavy-handed. <br/><br/>On the other hand, to tell the story from the viewpoint of the enslaved was a brave decision in an industry where few films have done it, and it comes over very well on the whole. The treatment of the slaves is not for the faint-hearted, they are shockingly harrowing and not comfortable to watch but they don't feel that gratuitous. There are some emotionally devastating moments, such as the ending and the long shot of Northup singing.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen was the right director for the film, a film that needed to be told in a brutal and honest way and being a director with that directing style McQueen brings that out perfectly in a bravura directing job. '12 Years a Slave' is very impressive visually and technically, and Hans Zimmer's score is suitably stirring.<br/><br/>John Ridley's script adapts Northup's memoir with tautness, honesty and sincerity, not subtly mind you but it's not a subtle subject. It only falters with Pitt's dialogue. <br/><br/>The acting is superb, with Chiwetel Ejiofor's powerfully restrained and sincere performance wholly deserving of its acclaim. Lupita N'Yong'o, very moving, and Michael Fassbender, at his most frightening, are more than up to his level, as are Sarah Paulson and Paul Dano. <br/><br/>Overall, extraordinary it isn't but an emotionally impactful film it certainly is. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","This movie had a positive impact towards me because it made me realize the cruelty of others to enslave people to do the hard work for them, no matter what was it about and the irony that today we are still fighting for this kind of stuff, I mean human rights. It is impressive, by the story of a man, who struggles to keep his identity and dignity, in a period when slavery was like a dice game and you didn't know where life would bring you after. The life of the main character is like an odyssey, with good and very, very bad times, but I think this is all about life, in the end, to be smashed and moved backward, and then to get up and move even forward."

"murtaza_mma","9","3","5","20 April 2014"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Steve McQueen's harrowing film about racism and slavery
","12 Years a Slave, a 2013 British-American historical drama film, directed by British filmmaker Steve McQueen, won the Oscar for the Best Picture at the 86th Academy Awards. Written by John Ridley, the Oscar- winning screenplay of 12 Years a Slave is based on an 1853 autobiography of the same name by Solomon Northup. 12 Years a Slave can best be described as a propaganda film censuring stigmas of racism and slavery in the antebellum United States. Made in the vein of the Blaxploitation films of the '70s, 12 Years a Slave is a powerful social commentary that poignantly depicts the heinous, racial exploitation of the Black people at the hands of their White masters who atrociously abuse them in more ways than any sane human being can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>McQueen is known to infuse his films with a singular sense of realism that inevitably elevates the subject matter, pushing it to grapple with far more complex motifs than what it seems set to achieve initially. While his first two films - Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011) - were more personal and less commercial, his third film, 12 Years a Slave, even though it has many of McQueen's central elements of despair, solitude, lust, sadomasochism, etc., is his most accessible film. It's a pity that McQueen eventually lost the Best Director Oscar to Alfonso Cuarón.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave presents the heart-wrenching tale a free black man from Saratoga Springs, New York who is deceived, abducted and sold into slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the part with great conviction; the Oscar nomination was well deserved. Ejiofor is greatly supported by an all-star ensemble cast that includes the likes of Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Fassbender, Paul Dano, and Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>And while Giamatti, Dano and others are quite impressive in their respective cameos, it is Fassbender who steals the show, and if there ever were any performance that merited an Oscar statuette, it's Fassbender's mesmerizing portrayal of Edwin Epps - a sadistic cotton planter who prides himself in being a ""nigger breaker"". Alas, the Academy never fails to disappoint! Fassbender plays the challenging part with great aplomb, goes through a gamut of emotions, matching every ounce of unrestrained brutality with equal degrees of feebleness and abject vulnerability. Fassbender is easily one of the most talented among the current crop of international actors. Speaking of performances, Lupita Nyong'o deserve a special mention for her Oscar- winning portrayal of Patsey - a young female slave who is repeatedly raped and abused by Epps while working on his plantation.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is not an easy film to watch, especially for those who are repulsed by brutality and torture. The graphic content of the movie can easily unsettle an uninitiated moviegoer. The gory and ostentatious manner in which the movie depicts the brutal slavery practices like flagellation and whipping places it in a very unique category of exploitation-cum-propaganda films.<br/><br/>That being said, 12 Years a Slave is lifted by McQueen's able direction, powerful performances delivered by the movie's ensemble cast, a very different kind of a musical arrangement from Hans Zimmer bolstered by the use of western classical and American folk music, and Sean Bobbitt's sumptuous cinematography. Slavery may be a matter of past but human oppression, especially of the weak, in its various forms continues to plague our world which makes 12 Years a Slave quite relevant even in today's modern age. Serious viewers just cannot afford to miss it! 9/10<br/><br/>A more in-depth review can be read at:<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

","Im gonna give this movie a 5 because i am really on the fence about the whole movie and how i should rate it and now i will explain why. this movie in an artistic format was a goddamn masterpiece and deserves a 10 for the realism and emotional power and art but when it comes to being an actual movie, this sucked. now i'm not trying to say that because i encourage slavery, i am saying this because at the end this movie was all based off of a stupid book and there was no point to the whole story considering the people who put the man in slavery never got charged or caught or anything. so basically my question is, WHAT WAS THE POINT ? this was the worst thing i have ever seen in my life (well maybe not as bad as ""Worlds Greatest Dad"" with Robin Williams) but still. how can Hollywood even let this through? they completely wasted amazing actors and ruined a good book, this should have stayed in the pages instead of staying on the screen for a damn good reason."

","First of all, excuse my language, but writing a German review wouldn't help at all. Puh, this was disappointing. I've waited several months for the day of watching this movie - it has already gotten its academy award. I was really looking forward to enjoy at least 134 Minutes of lifetime. But, I did not. While watching it, playing on my smart phone was actually more interesting and entertaining. Even this movie is - without any doubt- one of the better movies: The acting was partly brilliant and making a movie about former slavery in the US is modern, but they could have made much more of it. There are plenty endless lengths and without Hans Zimmers soundtrack this movie would have been more boring. The only remarkable and dramatic scenes were those endless scenes of torture and -of course- the ending scene, in which Brad Pitt -the co-producer of this movie- played the hero of the movie. Ridiculous. In my opinion this was NOT the best movie of 2013; ""The Kings Speech"" and ""The Artist"" were neither. It had simply won because of it's special theme. Score for its Genre: 8.5/10 - Whole: 6.5/10"
"ConsciousConnor","5","3","5","11 April 2014"," 12 years too long.
","I went into 12 YAS with an open mind. I only watched it yesterday night, which was after all the awards and buzz surrounding this movie. People say it's hard to watch, (which some scenes are I suppose) but I found the whole movie was hard to watch. Not because of it's accurate story- telling, costumes, dialogue, or anything like that.....It was just a bad movie in general. It was very slow and I could have used a lot more flow, struggle, and more ""moments"". I got the feeling only a couple times that our character was really struggling. And so many people were introduced that clogged our vision of the true story. And many had amazing opportunities to make amazing scenes. (Benedict, and almost with Fassbender) They both fell short though. And it's not their fault. I don't know how to describe it exactly. It's sort of like a documentary they would show in High School or College classes. The one where no one really wants to watch it and it takes 4 class periods to finish. <br/><br/>I'm sure many will disagree with me and call me a racist but that's not what I'm arguing. I'm arguing the movie as a MOVIE was not good. I gave it a five because as for location, costumes, and trying....it was okay. <br/><br/>Cheers."
"lauralmhs","3","3","5","5 April 2014"," An unforgivably wasted opportunity to tell a remarkable story
","Several months ago I was fortunate enough to discover the 1984 movie ""Solomon Northup's Odyssey"" among my local television listings. To my great surprise, I had never heard of this fascinating true story and sat enrapt while the compelling plot line unfolded of a free black man in 1841 Saratoga, New York, a talented fiddler, who was hoodwinked into traveling down to Washington, D.C. for a paid musical engagement and then kidnapped into slavery.<br/><br/>After all the Oscar hoopla, I caught ""12 Years a Slave"" on ""On Demand"" and I hate to have to say this, but I was exceedingly disappointed.<br/><br/>For one thing, if I had not seen the prior movie, I would have had difficulty following the finer points of this story line. Right off the bat, I knew I would be frustrated by the disjointed manner in which this movie unfolded. The use of flashbacks can be a very effective instrument, but here it was over-used, leaving the movie with little coherence.<br/><br/>Accordingly, there were small - sometimes important - details to the plot that I simply did not grasp.<br/><br/>More importantly, AND THIS IS WHAT IS SO EGREGIOUS: The director jettisoned a golden opportunity to tell a truly compelling and largely unknown story in favor of the opportunity to wallow in sadism and brutality.<br/><br/>We all know that slavery was a cruel, barbaric institution. But enough already! This movie was far too graphic in its violence. Was it really necessary to watch the skin being flayed off Patsey's back while she is being whipped? Was it really essential to the plot line to see Solomon hanging at the end of a noose for the length of time that the camera dwelled on this scene? Isn't it possible to get a point across without bringing the audience to the verge of nausea? One review on this site likened this movie to ""The Passion of the Christ,"" and I think that's very apt.<br/><br/>I must say the acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon was phenomenal. He was well deserving of his Oscar nomination. However, and I know there will be disagreement here, but I thought the rest of the acting was atrocious (the other exception being Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey). Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps was little more than the stereotype of a cruel and downright depraved slaveowner. Sarah Paulson as his wife was little more than an overly theatrical evil stepmother. And Brad Pitt? What the heck was that all about? <br/><br/>The ending was a sore disappointment. For one thing, Solomon's reunion with his family fell absolutely flat. Granted, it gave Mr. Ejiofor another opportunity to shine in his acting ability, but why so little joy on the part of his family upon his reunion with them? <br/><br/>Also criminally lacking was the background story of how Solomon came to be rescued. The behind-the-scenes machinations of his wife back in New York to find his whereabouts were simply swept under the rug.<br/><br/>In actuality, the movie gave short shrift to BOTH the before AND after of how Solomon was tricked into slavery, all in favor of the chance to bring stomach-churning brutality to the big screen. And that is a shame.<br/><br/>Very disappointing after all the press that this movie has generated. In the past I have painstakingly avoided movies that were presaged by the prospect of graphic violence, and if I had known that this was one of those movies, I would have avoided it as well.<br/><br/>Three out of ten stars, only for the stellar acting of the lead.<br/><br/>My best advice to anyone who reads this review is to try to get your hands on the aforementioned ""Solomon Northup's Odyssey,"" a far better movie."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","5","20 March 2014"," Powerhouse
","One review I read about this film praised it for being one of, if not the first film to portray slavery solely from the point of view of a slave. Not sure if that's true, but it sums up the tone and style of the film rather nicely. We're all aware that slavery existed in US and that it still exists in other parts of the world, but because history is largely written by the victors, most accounts of slavery come from the point of view of Caucasians. So, to base your film on one of the most influential accounts of slavery as written by an actual slave, was a somewhat risky, but important choice.<br/><br/>And what we end up getting is one of the most poignant and emotional films in recent memory. 12 Years a Slave is not afraid of its subject matter. It's a faithful representation of actual events and none of the ugliness is hidden or downplayed. It's a horrifying journey through years of misery, lost hopes, suffering and pain. Yet it never falls into despair, it doesn't alienate its viewers with needless gore or cruelty like an exploitation film might do.<br/><br/>The film's quality is only increased by some haunting acting jobs pulled off by the cast. Chiwetel Ejiofor especially is an amazing leading man as Soloman Northup and I must admit I'm somewhat disappointed that he didn't receive an Oscar for his efforts. He would have more than earned it. But to be fair, the rest of them are very talented as well and Lupita Nyong'o's Oscar was well-earned. But it's Ejiofor's performance we spend the most time with and there isn't a single scene where he doesn't absolutely sell it, with his heart and soul.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen's directing is also at the foreground. He follows Solomon's journey slowly and methodically, allowing for the slow scenes to go on as needed, lingering just long enough for the full impact to sink in. There's a certain feeling of art film in the long scenes of scenery and soft music, but it never feels unwarranted. The cut to the Southern nature, following an intense, blood-chilling scene of unimaginable cruelty, always comes as a chance to pull in and reflect.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave was named the Best Picture of 2013. And for the first time in years I'm one hundred percent behind that decision. This is an important film that will remain with us for years to come. But perhaps more importantly it's a masterwork of film making. Achingly beautiful, horrifying, depressing and uplifting all at the same time. Owe it to yourself to see it."
"andiewestie","10","3","5","16 March 2014"," A lesson in hope
","Despite the unspeakable cruelty displayed in this film, it is ultimately about the resiliency of the human spirit. <br/><br/>In the 19th century, for those who took a literal interpretation of the bible, the black population was regarded as sub-human, they were considered descendants of Ham and associated their station in life as the result of the debauchery of the son of Noah. <br/><br/>Land owners who justified their ill gotten gains on the backs of slaves looked to the bible and believed profoundly that they could manage but not change the ways of the slaves, through hard labour and bible teachings. <br/><br/>It's no wonder then, that we see the bible being used as justification for cruelty, particularly when we see a sadistic deranged slave owner speak of the ""lash"" This is not the loving Christian values we want to believe. That is the danger of different biblical interpretations, because this is twisted, selfish interpretation of the ""good word"" <br/><br/>This is an unblinking, raw, and probably the most accurate account of Soloman's life on film. The 12 years that changed him forever. If it's hard to watch, it's difficult to come to terms with how cruel mankind can be. It's a shameful history, and yet it was an economic reality for the South, naked capitalism, and was too lucrative to give up.<br/><br/>The shame of it all was every day 500lbs of cotton put money in the slave owners' pockets, but it wasn't enough, the greed was so great, the master wouldn't stop until he beat any notion of freedom they had in their souls. <br/><br/>And yet, Soloman never gave up hope, hope was not going to be beat out of him, his eyes were the witness of history and the window of hope; from the time he was kidnapped and flogged, to witnessing a man in muzzle for speaking his mind then watching him die for trying to save a woman's honor, to chancing upon men being lynched, to a woman begging for him to kill her mercifully, to being forced to do a violent act, his sorrow was in his eyes, McQueen's amazing direction lingered on Soloman's eyes, and it was his eyes that told the full story of hope that one day he would be free. <br/><br/>I truly loved this movie. Slavery is a complicated business, some will always feel guilt for what they endured or what they did to survive and who they left behind. It's a story that's not easy to witness because we want to believe we are better and have moved forward since those times. But we need to understand the realities of humanity. It's messy and not always kind. We have to work at being decent to one another everyday. It's all too easy to exploit others, it's not so easy to do the right thing. This is a movie for the times."

","It takes an emotional toll to watch Steve McQueen's poignant 2013 BEST PICTURE winner of the Academy awards, adapted from the autobiography of Solomon Northup, a free black man is sold into slavery for 12 years in the antebellum United States. <br/><br/>As the third feature film from UK auteur Steve McQueen (after HUNGER 2008, 7/10 and SHAME 2011, 9/10), 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a metamorphic achievement for his director competence, comes to grips with the grave source material, and transposes the text into a visually stupefying and inwardly resounding piece of cinematic treasure, compels audience to vicariously undergo the trials and tribulations of Solomon (Ejiofor) and his fellow black slaves, and to corroborate us the price of freedom is hard-won merely 150 years ago, we might say we have far progressed above the stupidity and narrow-mindedness portrays among the white folks in the film, and slavery is rather an antiquated concept, however, whether this self-aware moral improvement has reached its end of line, or 150 years later, when we our progeny harks back, we will be plainly as anachronistic as those pathetic, barbarous and abominable predecessors. <br/><br/>I digress too far, but I do intend to reiterate the value of this film, not because slavery is obsolete so we contemporaries have no urgency to watch it, in fact, we are in absolute obligation to reflect on those historic iniquity to alert ourselves not to recommit the same error, which we may agree, a large portion of people are treading the same water in the present climate. <br/><br/>Now, back to the film, McQueen and his team, in particular the long-time DP Sean Bobbitt, are luxuriating in their meticulous composition of each shot, the long-shot of Solomon hung on a tree struggling to life with his toes tipped on the ground while no one care or dare to set him loose (in the background, several slave kids frolicking around) is strikingly daunting to behold, whether white or black, their mentality is ingrainedly impaired; intermittently, the breathtakingly picturesque topographic shots of the southern land (the bayou, the cotton field or the windy woods) seamlessly transition the chronicle into another twist or perturbation. <br/><br/>The central dramatis personae is electrifying to the core, Ejiofor whole-heartedly radiates in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and every single take lingers on his bubble-eyed physiognomy is unimpeachably soul-stirring, his immaculate dedication oozes Solomon's despair, angst and persistence. Fassbender, McQueen's fixed leading man, lends himself to the meaty villain role, the outright racist plantation owner Edwin Epps,the dichotomy of his libido-driven infatuation with the young slave girl Patsey (Nyong'o) and the iron-clad truth she will never be completely his possession, is the centrepiece which culminates in an appalling whipping sequence where McQueen unbendingly fixates on Patsey's heartbreaking wail and the horrid lacerations, Nyong'o is no doubt meritorious for her Oscar-win with her debut, her final scene when seeing off Solomon to his freedom with both yearning (for herself) and felicity (for him) has been encapsulated with pitch perfect verisimilitude. <br/><br/>Further on, besides those three Oscar-nominated lucky ones, it is a handful of under-praised but equally memorable performances, Sarah Paulson (Mistress Epps), Alfre Woodard (Mistress Shaw) and Adepero Oduye (Eliza) all steal the limelight when their meagre screen-time is on, Paulson is brilliant with her glacial frigidity and sharp callousness, Woodard nails the most ambiguous role in the film with her composed utterance and Oduye brings about a burst of volcanic theatricality in her tête-à-tête with Ejiofor. By contrast, the other male side players are less prominent, Pitt is the ultimate messiah for Solomon, but reservedly underlit, and Paul Dano is on the verge of being typecast as someone either compulsively creepy or maddening annoying. <br/><br/>John Ridley's stern screenplay (the third Oscar win for the film) prunes the prolonged odyssey into a number of key chapters, carves out a clarified narrative arc while enlivening the jaded souls with terse lines full of understated connotations; Hans Zimmer's score mingles with the movie's awe-inspiring presentation of a history should never be forgotten, tallies with the credence of viewers' spontaneity, unobtrusive, but superbly competent alongside this epic voyage, if you can stick to the very end, it is a film can sublimate your moral sentience, and Steve McQueen is a filmic wizard of sublime gravitas, at the age of 45, we can optimistically hope that his best has yet to come."
"bbewnylorac","8","3","5","8 March 2014"," Good film
","As a non-American, I find it really interesting that so many reviewers here are uncomfortable with the explicit violence and nastiness portrayed in this film. How could it possibly be true? They seem to say. Surely Americans have never been that vicious and uncaring? But for hundreds of years, some of them were, and this film depicts it well. It's not a pleasant film but it does hold your attention and would make an excellent film for history classes. The film's creators depict Edwin Epps, the main slave owner, as an unapologetic bigot, manipulator, rapist and sadist. Generations of slave traders lived their lives like this. The slave of the film's title, Samuel Northup, did, at least, live some of his life in the relative comfort of the North, but it's sobering to realise that generations of slaves lived in total misery, with no way out of their situation. I found Brad Pitt's small role -- as the saviour who contact Samuel's friends and family, who rescue Northup from slavery -- as a little patronising. I.e. the white guy who saves the day for the black guy. But my companion pointed out that often blacks' only hope would have been someone helping them."
"teoteddy","10","3","5","5 March 2014"," A movie you don't forget so easily
","I watched this movie in the cinema and I'm glad that I did so cause it surely added up to the experience. After the movie I was under impression for quite some time. It managed perfectly to depict the horror of slavery. I haven't watched that often a movie that is so intense and compelling. <br/><br/>It also makes us think of how brutal and dehumanizing slavery was and how much affect it had on American society even up till today. I think that the story of the movie goes beyond the problem of slavery in USA cause the faith of Salomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) can happen to all of us with modern day human trafficking. Chiwetel Ejiofor as a main character played one of the best roles in recent years. His acting was just magnificent in portraying a free man who became a victim of kidnapping and ended up being transfered to the South and sold as a slave. As he experienced freedom and happiness in his earlier life it was so much harder for him to accept a fact of becoming a slave. His background and education was noticed by others but it just brought him more trouble so he had to hide that fact. Although he was quite badly affected with all the hardship of his situation brought he never lost faith and dignity cause he doesn't want just to survive he wants to live a normal and decent life. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender as a cruel slave owner Epps couldn't break his spirit as he did with so many other slaves. What I liked the most was the expresivness of his acting where you could read more from his face and his eyes than the actual words as slaves weren't allowed to show any emotions or have any opinions. Fassbender was also impressive in a role of obsessed and sadistic slave owner who was enjoying in torturing his slaves.<br/><br/>Although slave masters of that time treated their slaves in many different manner situation in which mr. Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) didn't help Salomon and just sold him to Epps showed how all the people who were part of that society were equally responsible for all the horror and injustice of slavery.<br/><br/>Have to add great camera and magnificent music from Hans Zimmer and to say that director Steve McQueen is a real discovery to me as well as Chiwetel Ejiofor. They both well deserve awards."

","It's always interesting to see a movie based on real events. Some of them are breathtaking, so it is but in a heart-wrecking way. It is not like someone who lost at sea for months or someone who trapped on an island for years. It is slavery, very cruel and harsh form of torture that takes one's freedom away.<br/><br/>This true story occurred back in 1841, nearly 170 years ago. A New Yorker Solomon Northup, a born-free black American was kidnapped and sold into slavery. So his journey into the dark world begins after he was assigned to work in various fields. It was incredible and unbelievable sad journey of those 12 years till he gets his freedom back.<br/><br/>After the movie 'Shame' Steve McQueen retained his favourite actor Michale Fassbender to play in a prominent role for the third time for this historical epic drama. As usual, he became the ambassador to McQueen's movie along with great performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The movie was captured in beautiful places of Louisiana. The unknown supporting cast was also given great support with their small roles in the story.<br/><br/>It was a good adaptation, but dialogues were very weak. There's no strong lines said anywhere in the movie or any memorable and rememberable. I believed the movie transformed exactly as the book says, I mean the original edition one. This movie is not appreciable for its contents because it was evilfull, but for bringing back the truth to the todays audience. It was acknowledgeable hard work for the cast and crew. So this movie will be recognised in big stages that mean the Oscar is not far away to fetch for McQueen and Chiwetel."
"ViktorDrake","4","3","5","26 February 2014"," Worthy but MASSIVELY overrated
","There is no doubt in my mind that Solomon Northup suffered greatly during the eponymous 12 years he spent as a slave in the Deep South. There is also no doubt that it was an incredibly bleak period of human history that quite rightly shouldn't ever be allowed to be forgotten. Lastly there is also no doubt that everyone involved with this movie (with the exception of Brad Pitt) puts in fantastically believable performances. Standouts for me were Chiwetel Ejiofor (fairly obviously) and especially Micheal Fassbender who gives an absolutely awesome turn as a man who clearly revelled in having the power of life and death over other human beings. Fassbender's performance alone is worthy of the entry price. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Brad Pitt as the one-and-only ""good"" white man portrayed in this film, but luckily he's not in the film too long, and his acting is quickly overshadowed by the other towering and nuanced performances on shows.<br/><br/>However, the movie itself is considerably less nuanced in places. The constant onslaught of violence, degradation and misery actually gets a little tiresome after a while, as does the ""white man is bad"" message that constantly pervades everything. As I say above, there is no doubt it WAS an extremely miserable time for anyone on the receiving end of such treatment from the slavers, but I personally think the movie lost a great deal of its potential impact by relentlessly beating the viewer into submission with its message. Basically I didn't think this movie had anything new to say that hasn't already been said a hundred times before. <br/><br/>The other problem for me was that some sequences were actually quite boring. The director seems to enjoy incredibly long and lingering close-ups in which absolutely nothing happens. One shot of Solomon Northup towards the end of the movie had him staring at nothing while the sound of bee buzzed in the background. I'm sure that shot lasted for over a minute...and absolutely nothing happened at the end of it.<br/><br/>Basically it's a worthy enough film dealing with troubling and powerful subject matter. The only problem is in the execution, but this film will no doubt garner a huge number of awards as the worthiness will outweigh the failings of the film."

","Hardly ever do Hollywood films deal with the topic of slavery and though it was just last year that Quentin Tarantino brought it up in Django Unchained, albeit in a decidedly different manner than Steve McQueen does in the film I'm now referring to, everyone could do with a refresher on these heinous acts. And if the first two full-length releases of the man in charge of the realisation were uncomfortable to watch, to say the least, it's all the better. Because what 12 Years a Slave is more than anything else, is the telling of horrible history – through the life of one free man that gets abducted and sold into slavery.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor is portraying this real-life character and surely delivers the performance of his lifetime as him, something that should, without a doubt, be honoured with an Oscar, if the Academy doesn't want me to completely lose my faith in them. In addition to displaying his character's distress with so much authenticity that it's painful to look at, at times, he convincingly swaps his native British accent for an American one, just as his on-screen colleagues Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender do. But that really is the least important aspect about the acting cast members in 12 Years a Slave; no matter on which side they're on, they provide their roles with a huge sense of realism, which is what makes the film a true horror flick. And one that is a lot more effective than the masses of others being released in this day and age to boot, due to the fact that the atrocities are tangible.<br/><br/>Although I maybe should refrain from using such adjectives in the review of a film about slavery, 12 Years a Slave does have an extraordinarily beautiful cinematography, interrupting the brutal moments of violence for picturesque landscape shots that Sean Bobbitt wonderfully captures. As it is nominated for as much as nine Academy Awards, there are also many other merits to Steve McQueen's third motion picture, but that isn't really what matters. All of this having actually happened is, and thus 12 Years a Slave functions as an essential reminder about this terrible part of world history, while not making it a farcical gorefest as the Tarantino production I've mentioned in the beginning did."
"JamesHitchcock","9","3","5","21 February 2014"," No, Not That Steve McQueen
","No, not that Steve McQueen.<br/><br/>During the first two thirds of the nineteenth century, slavery was the key issue in American politics. It poisoned relationships between the states and eventually led to civil war. Its legacy has seriously affected, and continues to affect, relationships between black and white and between North and South. And yet the cinema has never paid much attention to the subject; films about the antebellum Deep South and its ""peculiar institution"" have been few and far between, Spielberg's ""Amistad"" being one of the few exceptions. Perhaps the subject is even today just too controversial for Hollywood's liking.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" does something to redress the balance, although it is notable that it was made by a British director (of Jamaican ancestry) and that there are only two major American stars, Brad Pitt and Paul Dano, both in supporting roles. The four major roles are played by Chiwetel Ejiofor (British, of Nigerian ancestry), Michael Fassbender (Irish, of German ancestry), Benedict Cumberbatch (British, of white Barbadian ancestry) and Lupita Nyong'o (Kenyan). It is based upon the true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man from New York State who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He was forced to work on plantations in Louisiana for twelve years before his release. <br/><br/>Northup's first master, William Ford, is a relatively humane and liberal man. To modern eyes those adjectives look strange and inappropriate; to us the very act of enslaving someone is about as illiberal and inhumane as one can get. Yet the contrast is brought out when Ford is forced by circumstances to sell Northup, now renamed ""Platt"", to another plantation owner, Edwin Epps. Epps is a savage brute who rapes his female slaves and mercilessly beats any slave, male or female, who fails to pick their daily quota of 200 pounds of cotton or who incurs his displeasure in any other way. Northern abolitionists, who were often devout Christians, tended to assume that Southern slave-owners must all be godless unbelievers, but this was often not the case. Epps attempts to justify his cruelty by references to the Bible, and even preaches his own interpretation of the Scriptures to his slaves in the belief that this will help reconcile them to their lot. <br/><br/>The film is unsparing in its depiction of the brutality of the slave system, more so than previous films on the subject. One reviewer stated that "" 'Roots' is 'The Care Bears Movie' in comparison to this."". One particularly harrowing scene comes when Epps forces Northup to whip a female slave who has displeased him and then, when Northup shows obvious reluctance, completes the task himself with savage relish. The film also shows how many Southerners who did not own slaves themselves nevertheless accepted or even actively supported the system; the one person who is prepared to condemn slavery is an outsider, not even a Northerner but a Canadian, and even he is at first cautious about taking any steps to assist Northup. <br/><br/>Ejiofor greatly impressed me when I first saw him in ""Dirty Pretty Things"" about twelve years ago, and gives another very impressive performance here, endowing Northup with great dignity and an inner strength which enables him to survive unbowed blows of fate which would have crushed most men. The other outstanding contributions come from Fassbender as Epps, one of the most frightening villains since Goeth in ""Schindler's List"" and Nyong'o as the female slave Patsey. <br/><br/>Slavery was of course an institution which destroyed the lives of millions of people over a period of more than two centuries. McQueen's achievement is that he is able to use the life of one individual to expose the enormity of this continuing crime against humanity, just as ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" used a single individual to examine the enormity of the Holocaust, or ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"" did the same for the Soviet gulags. The film has been nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Steve McQueen has a good chance of winning the Oscar which always eluded his illustrious namesake. 9/10"
"bix171","10","3","5","20 February 2014"," A Great Film Experience
","Steve McQueen's calculating, unerring eye shows you everything you need to see to form a judgment, but he wisely collaborates with both the great John Ridley (""U-Turn""), whose script gives ""12 Years A Slave"" a deep texture, and actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, who, working with committed filmmakers, allows his presence to become a blank canvas for McQueen and Ridley to convey their fear, anger, frustration and compassion. (Other examples of this in cinema are Catherine Deneuve and Luis Bunuel in ""Belle de Jour""; Adrien Brody and Roman Polanski in ""The Pianist""; and Brad Pitt and David Fincher in ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"".) The result is a riveting, unrelenting and ultimately tragic story of slavery set against the backdrop of the lush (and indifferent) beauty of the Deep South. McQueen's focused tracking shots (the rich cinematography is by Sean Bobbitt) draw you into Ejiofor's point of view only to separate you at crucial moments so that you feel the crushing emotional weight of each character (in particular, during a brutal lashing that becomes the film's devastating climax). There are deeply felt supporting performances by a brave Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch (sympathetic in his conflict), the frequently overlooked Paul Dano, Lupita Nyong'o (whose despair permeates the film) and Michael Fassbender as the cruel plantation owner who comes to represent the South's many paradoxes; but note should also be made of Sarah Paulson as Fassbender's wife--it's her outrage at both her husband and her surroundings that lends the film the critical addition of sexual tension. A great film, one that demands future revisits."
"LloydBayer","10","3","5","3 February 2014"," 12 Years a slave is more than just a milestone achievement in filmmaking. It is every bit a masterpiece as much as it is essential cinema.
","There are few films that refuse to leave a viewer's system hours and even days after they are seen. Some of these films radiate overwhelming joy, while others leave a bitter aftertaste that is hard to get rid of. 12 Years a Slave has the rare distinction of being both a triumphant story on the persistent power of the human spirit while simultaneously dwelling into the darkest recesses of the human soul. Although generally mistaken for the same thing, there is a glaring difference between the human spirit and the soul because only one of these can be tainted with racial prejudice. And that is the soul, the metaphysical constitution of a human being but that which has unlimited potential to harbour raw hate. How this hate transcends beyond cruelty is director Steve McQueen's masterstroke in this outstanding film.<br/><br/>As a period piece set in 1841, 12 Years a Slave is a true story; a first hand account of slavery as published by Solomon Northup in an 1853 memoir of the same name. Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man from a middle class African-American family in Saratoga, New York. His entire life changes for the worse the day he is kidnapped and shipped to plantations in the South. Here, he looses his identity, his freedom, his family, but most of all, his stature as a human being. During the course of these twelve years, Northup encounters inhumane cruelty from the day he is sold as a ""fit beast"". He is bought and sold, witnesses the rape and murder of other slaves in captivity and is all but 'broken' by his sadistic master and owner Edwin Epps (terrifyingly played by Michael Fassbender).<br/><br/>Don't be surprised if people walk out during the show. This is not an easy film to watch, let alone digest. The depiction of cruelty is as unbelievable as it is frequently stomach knotting. There are multiple scenes of intense physical abuse that are very unforgiving for the timid viewer. But if you can stomach the violence, there are tear-jerking scenes that are equally emotionally crushing. One particular scene has a mother separated from her children when her family is sold to different slave owners. Incidentally, the slave trader who sells these slaves is played by Paul Giamatti, but the manner in which he sells his slaves has a striking similarity to the scene where he sells human 'slaves' to apes, in Planet of The Apes (2001). I'm not sure if there is a hidden message here, but I found this scene rather perplexing. Another disturbing segment is a five minute lynching scene where a slave is left hanging all through the day. This is also where the film treads into art house territory. No surprise there because like his previous films Hunger and Shame, McQueen's deft brushstrokes reveal a beautiful picture, but a picture about an ugly subject.<br/><br/>To say that 12 Years a slave is a milestone achievement in filmmaking would only be half truth. It is every bit a masterpiece as much as it is essential cinema. From Sean Bobbitt's captivating cinematography and Hans Zimmer's moving original music, to flawless performances from an ensemble of top actors (including Paul Dano, Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch in plot twisting key roles), the credit goes to everyone involved in its making. In a remarkable performance for a debut role, Mexican-Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o plays the most tragic character in the film – Patsy, a slave caught between her master's nightly visits and her master's wife's jealousy over said reason. Even so, nothing can prepare you for one of the toughest scenes in the film and this is towards the end, where Patsy, along with the audience, must endure a gruelling lesson in disobedience.<br/><br/>Last year Daniel Day-Lewis walked away with an Academy Award for his portrayal of President Lincoln, who at the height of power, emancipated slavery. It would be a diabolical irony if the same honour is not bestowed upon Ejiofor for what is simply an outstanding portrayal of a man stripped of his basic right to be treated as a human being. Watch 12 Years a Slave, not just because it has received nine Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, but because the film challenges you to imagine the mental and physical agony of a victim of racial prejudice; Because it does this and a lot more and does not expect the viewer to rest easy during any of its 134 minutes of running time and beyond."

","Imagine having yourself, a completely free human, end up drugged, bound, stripped of your freedoms and rendered a slave for twelve long, arduous years. You would have no contact with your family or friends, you would not be permitted to mention your prior life as a free man without the threat of being beaten, and you would serve an abusive and tyrannical slavemaster for twelve years of Hell. You would be tested to your limits as you are beaten within inches of your life each and every day. Does this sound like something out of your nightmares? It is not, because that is what Solomon Northup went through. <br/><br/>The phenomenal acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup is something that must be seen to be believed. His mannerisms of desperation, nervousness, and pain throughout the film provides the harrowing study who loses his freedom, goes through unspeakable acts of cruelty, and becomes a free man again. It is truly a performance that proves that small things such as facial expressions and body language can make a world of difference in the world of acting. As much as I think that Leonardo DiCaprio should receive his Best Actor Oscar for his role in The Wolf Of Wall Street, I would not consider it a snub if Chiwetel Ejiofor wins instead.<br/><br/>However, Ejiofor is far from the only standout performance in the movie. Michael Fassbender earns a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor nomination in a performance as Edwin Epps you will love to hate. Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch give performance that may not get much screen time, but are enjoyable for the screen time they do receive. Sarah Paulson scores as the hateful, blatantly racist wife of Edwin Epps. Last, but not least, is Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, a role that few actresses (especially among African American actresses) have matched in terms of sheer pain and sorrow expressed on the screen (she deserves a Best Supporting Actress win, not merely a nomination).<br/><br/>As a senior in high school who holds a fascination with this particular era of history (among several others), the things I heard of the film being the most harrowing portrayal of slavery on film are 100% true. This film can be brutal at moments, including whippings, overwork, an execution, and a rape, among other atrocities. However, the film is portrayed with such raw honesty that transcends the horrific acts of cruelty that are depicted on screen. Steve McQueen (the director) truly pulls no punches when it comes to explicitly depicting the time accurately. The language (Did you really expect a period piece on slavery to not include the n-word?), the fashion (the costume design is exquisite), and the cruelty (for reasons I've already explained) are all true to the particular era in American history.<br/><br/>Emotionally, few films have affected me as deeply as 12 Years A Slave. This is easily one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen (and the most disturbing one about slavery). In fact, as far as overall depression is concerned, it would not be entirely inaccurate to refer to this movie as ""The ""Schindler's List"" of Slavery-themed movies."" However, this is also one of the best movies of 2013. Loaded with amazing acting, the film grips you from the start and does not stop pulling you emotionally until the movie is finished."
"freemantle_uk","10","3","5","17 January 2014"," An emotionally draining and important historical film
","2014's Oscar nominations are in and 12 Years a Slave is one of the leading contenders for awards, for deserved reasons. Steve McQueen's stock as a director continues to rise as he delivers a powerful piece of cinema, unflinching and historically detailed film about the brutality of slavery as people are beaten and families are broken up in heart wrenching ways. McQueen's style of wide shot and long takes are perfectly suited for screen, particularly a brutal whipping sequence and showing when Solomon is left hanging and people around him go about their normal lives. There is a natural look in the setting and the cinematography uses natural lighting to great effect. The acting for the story if of a top level, being bold, emotional and theatrical throughout. The excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor centres this film, giving a great performance as an educated man whose spirit slowly breaks due to his years of captivity and being treated as nothing more than property. He is surrounded by a top cast, all giving excellent and complex characters showing the different parts of the society of the Deep South before the Civil War. Lupita Nyong'o and Adepero Oduye were both excellent two women who suffer greatly due to Slavery, and we get different perspectives, from Bendict Cumberbatch's William Ford who is one of the kinder slave owner, but overall a coward to the more brutal Michael Fassbender, playing one of the most vile characters in cinema in recent years whilst still giving the occasional moment of be human.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave tells an important story and done in a brutal, realist way. It is the most deserving of all the Oscar contenders."
"Hello_Im_David","10","3","5","13 January 2014"," Confronting History
","How can I express how much I loved this movie? I could talk about the great performances from the entire cast, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender. Or I could talk about the amazing direction and storytelling on behalf of the great Steve McQueen. I could also mention the moving score, the breathtaking cinematography or the script by John Ridley. But this is a movie that goes beyond all of that. It honestly changed me. <br/><br/>I have lived my entire life in the South. It has it's perks, of course, such as good cooking, friendly people and warmer weather than most places in America. We have sweet tea and beautiful sprawling pastures, but we have a shared horrific history, and this is a history that no one really likes to talk about down here. Slavery existed in the South for 250 years and (legal) institutional racism lasted another 100 years. It's really quite unfathomable to think of the generations of people who were mistreated, dehumanized, tortured, raped and murdered as a normal, everyday routine for the vast majority of our history. Watching this movie, I couldn't help but dwell on this shared past. <br/><br/>This is a brutal movie to watch and there will be many who just aren't up for it. But even more brutal than the beatings Patsy is forced to endure, or the noose around Solomon's neck is the reminder that these events are not fictional. They happened just down the street from where I live now. It takes about 20 minutes to drive from my house to the old building downtown where slaves used to be auctioned off. My own ancestors surely owned slaves, and if I could hear them speak I'm sure they would echo the words of Edwin Epps when they speak of lashings as biblical providence or human beings with darker skin than their own as no more than property, as any other livestock they might have owned. This is the power of 12 Years a Slave. It forces us to confront a past that we are often too scared or too ashamed to face. <br/><br/>Some have already attacked this movie as an ""indictment of white America,"" a movie that is meant to do nothing else but cause racial tension and ignite white guilt, but this is far from the truth. First, This is a movie that transcends nationality. Though it is set in America, slavery has existed thousands of year the world over. Race based slavery existed throughout the Americas and in Europe and was arguably even more horrifying in countries like Brazil, where many slave owners found it more profitable to work a slave to death after two or three years and buy a new one. Second, this movie is, if anything, a celebration of the countless men and women who endured, the men and women who lived through these unspeakable horrors but found the courage to go on living and even to fight for their freedom as Solomon did. It is not meant to demonize white people or to stir up race riots as some hopelessly small minded people believe. This is not a movie that seeks to divide. It celebrates the humanity in all people and shows us that life is worth fighting for."

","Steve McQueens new film '12 Years A Slave' is an adaptation of the memoirs of Solomon Northup, a free black American violinist from New York who was kidnapped and sold as a slave to a Louisiana plantation owner in 1841.<br/><br/>Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has a wife (Kelsey Scott) and children, and was enticed by a couple of showmen to play for a lot of money. After a heavy night of drinking with these men, he awakes to quickly realise that he is to be taken to New Orleans to meet the first of many unscrupulous men who use him as a slave. Slave trader Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) gives Solomon his new slave name Platt, and sells him to plantation owner Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). As the film title suggests Northup spends the next 12 years as a slave, not just with Ford but also for an even more wicked cotton plantation owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).<br/><br/>""Sin, there is no sin. I can do as I wish with my property"", Epps is the quintessential hate- figure, a renowned ""nigger breaker"" who shows no compunction in lacerating his slaves whenever he chooses. By the time Northup becomes Epps' property, McQueens' singular focus on Northup's nightmare is all too real and harrowing. Northup dominates the film, but the strength of '12 Years A Slave' is not just in showing what he has gone through but that for the women its far worse. Women are regularly torn from their children who are sold separately, the likes of Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o) suffer the added torment of rape. Patsy is Epps' mistress of choice, not only does she suffer the abuse from him but also from the jealous Mrs Epps (Sarah Paulson) who is as equally vengeful.<br/><br/>Its an understatement to say that '12 Years A Slave' isn't an easy watch, McQueens unflinching and unsentimental film relives America's enslavement of black people in all its horror. There is so much detail in this film, even the language is historically accurate. Although filmed impeccably, there's a lot of economy in McQueens artistic flourishes, which is a shame. Everything is shown through the tormented eyes of the slaves, specifically Northup. McQueen isn't afraid to prolong the agony for maximum emotional impact, not least in the incredible hanging sequence where Northup's toes are barely touching the damp muddy ground. Its a thought-provoking and poignant moment, showing us not just the excruciating pain and suffering he had to endure but that all the other slaves carried on as normal for fear of similar reprisals if they helped him.<br/><br/>'12 Years A Slave' has some superb performances by a very strong cast, the big surprise being the unknown Nyong'o who is superb as Patsy. The film unearths devastating performances from the two outstanding British actors Fassbender and Ejiofor, using opposing techniques to flesh out their roles. The more theatrical Fassbender is repellent to the core, the epitome of evil. His faith in his religion and his own manipulation of it is a sad and all too real indictment of how religion is used to justify the worst in men. Ejiofor is spellbinding as the more internalised Northup, using his body and face to convey Northup's terror and anguish. And those eyes, those pained eyes of his which shows a normally articulate man inhibited by his inability to speak up for fear of being beaten or far worse.<br/><br/>'12 Years A Slave' is a savage account of slavery and the Americans treatment of black people. Slavery may be a thing of the past, but the film does also highlight the fact that enslavement comes in many forms and that it does still exist, its just not as visible."

","'12 years a slave' was an amazing, gripping, and emotional drama, with a potent script and powerhouse performances from every single actor in the movie. It's horrifying how that actually happened, and the way it was brought to life by Steve McQueen was brutal and harsh, but had moments of beauty in it also. Certainly a film that will stand the test of time. A masterpiece? Most definitely, and if the film downs receive the best actor Oscar, best director Oscar and best supporting actor Oscar I will be hugely shocked. Even the soundtrack added beauty to the film, Hans Zimmer has done it yet again! I said about American Hustle that it would be hard for a film to beat that this year, but 12 years a slave just has, and I think it will be regarded as film of the year amongst many. Absolutely mesmerizing! I recommend it to everyone, it truly is an emotional journey. Worth every penny of the cinema ticket. WOW."
"nullcreations","10","3","5","12 January 2014"," Best movie of the year
","Few films move me, and fewer still evoke an emotion so powerful as to move me to tears. Made all the more real by it's truth, one that we as a species must never forget. It also endeavors to show us all the shades of grey which existed at that time, and that slavery was not a universally accepted ideology even then. <br/><br/>The entire movie I found myself waiting for Solomon (the protagonist played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) to lose it and kill them all like some tale of vengeance, but this doesn't occur. If you're expecting Django Unchained here, stop and forget the thought. Despite action aficionados wanting such a thing believe me when I say it's good that it doesn't go down this way. Solomon is not a murderer (even if one could consider it justifiable) and he's not cruel. He's just a man thrust in to a world he doesn't know, but is forced to understand. The development of his character from a carefree person with no worries to a person who's eyes are opened to humanity's horrors through physical and emotional pain and loss is well paced.<br/><br/>To say that Chiwetel Ejiofor performance was incredible and heartfelt wouldn't be doing it sufficient justice - nor would it be fair to discount the performances of any other actor in this film. It is a rare pleasure to have a cast so invested as to give 150% throughout. When I saw Brad Pitt's name in the cast I thought for sure that he would have more screen time being as well known as he is, but such is not really the case. He plays an important but relatively small part in the picture which is assisted in just the right portions by the entire cast.<br/><br/>Even if you're not one for dramas, you should make time for this movie. Through its profoundly brutal depiction of a pre-civil war America we are given a very small but revealing glimpse in to one of the darkest and most deplorable periods of the country's history. Cinematic performances don't get better than this."

Rife with visceral beatings, multiple lynchings and an almost casual air of psychological cruelty, 12 Years a Slave is anything but easy to watch, but it is powerfully moving.<br/><br/>It's also a powerful corrective, because it so skillfully links that brutality to the sort of tranquil antebellum South that Hollywood has often peddled — the broad porches, the hoop skirts, the fields fluffy with cotton. It will be hard for audiences to see those images ever again without thinking about the savagery and injustice that propped them up."
"takashi_kupo","9","3","5","26 December 2013"," The Best of 2013's Crop
","2013 will be remembered cinematically for one of the strongest years in movie history. Not because it had one atomic offering, but because it had several films that were exceptional. Chief among them is 12 Years a Slave.<br/><br/>Following the journey of a free black man in the new world, Solomon Northrup is an intelligent, humble being played brilliantly by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The first half of the movie cuts back and forth between Solomon's life as a free man and his journey as an unlawfully captured slave. The contrast is damning as Solomon does his best to be a good husband and father while the next moment we see him in the throws of a sugar cane field, or cotton field in the next frame. What Ejiofor brings to the role of Solomon is not just a strong man, but a man who is apologetic and seemingly frail during his moments of freedom, but steely and malleable when he needs to survive. Every inch of his body is changed at some point in the film, whether it be from a learned fiddle player from the north, or to the violently beaten man who had just been whipped in the South. Even during times of great distress and fear like when he passes through a live lynching and must expose his owner's tags to a group of rednecks in the woods, the immense perspiration on his face and tremble in his hands are key to Ejiofor's exceptional performance.<br/><br/>The other actors who are given enough lines stand out tremendously too. Sarah Paulson as the mistress and terrifying wife of Master Epps, shines as the villainess who terrorizes the most beautiful conquest of the Epps estate, Patsey. The better half of the Epps household is Michael Fassbender's Edwin Epps, known to the locals as ""The Slave Breaker"". His excruciating punishments, biblical defenses for tyranny over his slaves, and insane personage rocks the screen every time he appears. His sick need to conquer Patsey is only succeeded by his harassment of the newest slave, Solomon. Epps fears nothing more than a learned slave and awaits any chance he can get to put Solomon down.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is Patsey herself. Every shriek, tear, and gulp, down to the very plea she makes for her life is burned into your mind as the movie goes on. Lupita Nyong'O deserves all the awards she gets for this one. As do Fassbender and Ejiofor. If these three cleaned up their respective acting categories on Oscar night, it will be a well earned victory for each one of them.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen, the director, does wonders in his role. Many of the films most brilliant moments come during the extended shots, though some tend not to make sense, hence the missing star. But for those that do work, they are agonizing. Solomon's hanging near death while the other slaves go about their day, and the kids play behind him takes us back to those days in a visceral and evocative way. McQueen's propensity to show us a myriad of characters all at once also suits the movies monstrously unprivate atmosphere. Slaves are bundled into houses that nearly don't fit them, and one scene in particular, where a female slave uses Solomon to orgasm then turns over and begins to weep is powerful because you realize that not even the basic need of sexual fulfillment can be enjoyed as they are all doomed to these public quarters where the fellow property resides.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is powerful. It is a slow burn to fruition as Solomon finds himself near the end, not a slave who awaits his freedom any longer or a slave who has given up hope. He finds himself in the death of an old man and realizes that he is strong, using his voice and a group song during the funeral of this old man to announce how powerful he is in the shackles of unjustice. Though ultimately fate has a different ending for him, ""Roll, Johnnie roll,"" announces his full body armor has been constructed and his spirit cannot be obstructed. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is worth their salt in cinema enthusiasm, and I hope that it is one day shown as mandatory education."

Barely ten years before Lincoln proclaimed the abolition of slavery , and the book was also used as propaganda by the abolitionists that Northup, a black man born in freedom, he himself joined .<br/><br/>Steve McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley (""Three Kings"") had been able to take what happened afterwards, when Northup helped slaves escape. But they stick to the literary boundaries and thus makes the film into what the book is, one man 's testimony about something that affected many.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen has said he thought he understood what slavery was before he read the biography. But the film, just like the book, lays bare the humiliation that is difficult to imagine. The key is that we see the system through someone we can identify with, someone not indoctrinated from birth but suddenly suffer from insanity with full force.<br/><br/>In the feature film debut ""Hunger"" (2008), about the IRA-martyr Bobby Sands, and in ""Shame"", about a sex addict, Steve McQueen meditated on the body burden and means of expression. And the slavery bizarre premise, that a person's body may be someone else's property, invites rich storytelling .<br/><br/>When Northup wakes up after being drugged and betrayed by two superficial acquaintances, he has, in the 1840s U.S. not have a chance.

Is the slave trader screaming and beat into words as a spell with a paddle. The body becomes a prison. He gets undressed, and dressed as a slave. He loses his real name.<br/><br/>At the slave auction where Solomon eventually ends. It not people the slave traders show up, but the muscles, flesh and limbs with different merits. The violence, carried out with whips, ropes and kind, keeps coming back. But we must also see what happens afterwards: the pain, the wounds bathed and the crippling shame of those who are powerless beside .<br/><br/>The white people that Solomon Northup meets on his odyssey in hell makes you think of the three monkeys who do not hear, do not see and do not say anything, locked in a system they are unable to question : Ford ( Benedict Cumberbatch ), the slave owner with a bleeding conscience, during whale Tibeats (Paul Dano ) the epitome of a weak talented racist, and so Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender ), a brutal sadist who are inclined towards Luke. But even if Northrup conceal their identity as highly skilled in order to avoid provoking more violence, he disturbs their circles .<br/><br/>McQueen and Sean Bobbitt, photographer in all brit's films, working with contrasts. Intrusive images in natural light set against the tableau - like compositions close to traditional painting or set-ups in front of a photographer. A desperate sexual encounter in the slave barracks set against images of Solomon and his wife in a bed that appears to be supernaturally clean in comparison. Picturesque images of mansions embedded in greenery, sunlight and chirping of birds set against the abuse that goes on there.<br/><br/>The film's greatest moment is the scene where Northup being hanged in a tree after assaulting a guard. He escapes lynching, but must remain a full day as punishment, on the toe, to avoid being suffocated by the rigged noose. In almost three minutes, we hear only his wheezing, and it is a long time in a movie. Meanwhile the other slaves manages their chores in the background. Children noise on a distance. A foreman wandering around. One of the slaves creeping quickly up with water for Solomon. The lady of the house watching from her balcony. The sun has time to lose.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor does a heroic deed when he portrays Northups struggle to stay alive. It is on his shoulders the film rests, even if the whole cast is amazing, especially Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender. The only objection, which probably mostly about the ingrained expectation, is that it adds a damper on the strong emotions in the final scene, which feels static. It is also an illustration of a convulsively restored dignity."

I am surprised to see that the rating was so high here on IMDb. Am I missing something here? It fails to connect, and falls flat compared to the two afore-mentioned predecessors.

"gavin6942","8","4","8","23 February 2014"," The Most Honest Look at Slavery?
","In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery.<br/><br/>No film from 2013 has been more rewarded and awarded than ""12 Years a Slave"", and with good reason -- an incredible (yet true) plot fleshed out by some remarkable actors that really captures what slavery was like without the gratuitous violence of exploitation or the overt sentimentality of a Spielberg film. There is no surprise that the film has captured the top slot in many critics' lists and enters the Oscar race with an impressive nine nominations.<br/><br/>Right off the bat let us say that if ""12 Years a Slave"" wins Best Picture at the Academy Awards, there is no shame in that. This is the kind of film that deserves to win, as it both looks good and covers a topic of great importance. Slavery may not be in the forefront of our minds, but it is always a part of American history we have to live with. That is why I think this film will take the statuette home.<br/><br/>After that, the race gets a lot more complicated. A win for adapted screenplay seems fair, as this story more than adequately brings to life historical figures in a way that comes across -- dare I say it -- entertaining, while also being honest and truthful to the source.<br/><br/>But a best actor for Chiwetel Ejiofor? This is hard to say. While no one would argue he did not deserve such an award, he happens to be up against Matthew McConaughey in ""Dallas Buyers Club"". For both men, this is the role that will be the peak of their careers most likely, and I have to say McConaughey gave just a little bit more. So the edge is slight but evident.<br/><br/>The exact same situation awaits Michael Fassbender, who was devious as Edwin Epps without becoming a caricature. He is this year's Christoph Waltz, which is quite the feat. But against Jared Leto? Again, the edge tends to favor the actor who put his own physical health on the line, and I think Fassbender will come in second.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey could get an award. The actress fields are not as strong this year as in the past, and it would be a good time to sneak in past the more established people in the field. (Although her role is small, I was also pleased to see Quvenzhané Wallis as Margaret Northup. Regardless of how everything turned out, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" was the film of 2012 thanks to her.) <br/><br/>The only really disappointing thing was the presence of Brad Pitt as Bass, the film's hero (if there is one). Whether or not his acting was good, the part seemed all wrong. Pitt stands out as too recognizable in this world, and when he appears it is as if out of nowhere, proudly talking down his employer with repercussions. Was this necessary? Did we need what amounts to a 21st century man breaking the fourth wall to save the day?<br/><br/>That nitpick aside, this is an excellent film and deserves any and all honors that come its way."

","Solomon Northup, a respected free black musician and family man in 1841 New York, is kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana and the film, adapted from the book he produced afterwards, recounts his experiences during the 12 years until he regained his freedom.<br/><br/>Although this film has elements which did not come from Northup's book, everything in it is true: slaves were treated like this. The vile physical abuse shown very graphically in this film was not perpetrated by every slave owner, but the fact remains that slaves were property with no rights, and things like the naked examinations before being sold, splitting up families and so on - not physical abuse, but abuse nonetheless - are simply part and parcel of what slavery is (I make this point as I have noted some people defensively commenting that the film perhaps overstates its case - well, it doesn't).<br/><br/>Having established that the subject matter is factual, dramatic, emotionally involving, and powerful, how well does the film deal with conveying it to the audience? Pretty well, actually. Despite the fact that the content is very strong and, in some ways, borders on cliché, most of the key figures are well drawn and believable human beings, with some excellent performances - Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon holds the film together with a moving performance, but he is matched by Michael Fassbender as Epps (who, frighteningly, believes that what he is doing has God's approval) and Lupita Nyong'o as the unfortunate Patsey.<br/><br/>This is strong stuff, but it engages the audience emotionally. And let us not forget that while slavery may have been abolished in the west, that doesn't mean that is not still practised elsewhere."
"psylla_","10","4","8","25 January 2014"," A Truly Astonishing Cinematography Experience
","I just saw this movie a few hours ago, and I have to say that it's one of the best things I've ever seen in my life. I assume most of the audience knew the plot as it's the commonly known story of Solomon Northup. Now, when you film an adaptation of an historical story, the thing that makes the movie beautiful is the way you reflect events. 12 Years A Slave is a perfect example of that. The movie was, obviously, visually fascinating; the scenes were just like paintings. In my entire life, among all the movies I've seen, 12 Years A Slave is the only one that made me amazed by actors performances. I found it quite hard to believe that people were actually acting, and even I could feel their happiness, anger, agony and desire to be free. I even wondered if McQueen actually took those people captive. The emotional side of this movie was not like anything I had ever seen before. It left the entire audience in tears. Besides, it could even make you laugh time to time. As for the soundtracks, the movie mostly consisted of the songs that were sung by cast members, and a great lot of violin was also used. Overall, 12 Years A Slave, given that it's artistically and emotionally flawless, appeals to your eyes, your ears, and to your heart at the same moment. It's a must see, and I suggest you to go see it in theaters while you still can, it's going to be an experience that you'll not forget for the rest of your life. 12 Years A Slave could easily be the best movie that's made in past 10 years, McQueen really managed to create an important milestone - not only for his career, but the whole cinematography. And I definitely except this to win some Oscaras."
"mikekisil","9","4","8","19 January 2014"," Best Film Ever.....Hmmmm.
","I'm always sceptical of films which arrive on my local multiplex screen with a massive reputation for quality. Is it orchestrated by the film's marketing department in order to get bums on seats? After all we are talking masters in the field of media manipulation, aren't we? So cautiously I approached this film. Having watched ""The Railway Man"" earlier in the week, I was prepared for another ""hard watch"". What I was not expecting was to be put through an emotional mangle that left me pretending I had something stuck in my eye that need a good few minutes of ""tearing up"" before I could leave the cinema - and I was not the only man doing this. I have never had it brought home to me so forcefully what the concept of slavery in the USA of the 1850's was about. How white folk treated black folk as chattel was an ethereal idea for me often coloured by films such as ""Gone with the Wind"". Steve McQueen's film confronted you with the brutality of it by showing you the viewer what it entailed unflinchingly. To do this he has gathered a technical team and a group of actors and committed them to being at the top of their game in order to show the cinema-going world what slavery is, so that the next time you see a newspaper headline that talks of ""human trafficking"" you are aware that slavery has not completely gone away and still needs to be stamped out and its' perpetrators brought to summary justice. What would a modern equivalent be? Emily Watson criminally drugged up on a night out and then enduring a ""taming"" process in order to end up in a middle-eastern harem. Fanciful thinking? There are too many stories in the press of girls from Eastern Europe and China enduring this shameful activity for you to realise that slavery has not gone away.<br/><br/>But what about the film and the performances in it? I always thought of Chiwetel Ejiofar as the jobbing black actor with the unpronounceable name whose portfolio of performances made him hard to pigeon-hole but here I think I have seen an actor make full use of his natural equipment i.e. body, speech and, most tellingly, eyes, to create a performance that has seared itself into my memory. His is a complex portrayal of a man wrenched from the comfort of his environment and forced to see and endure man's inhumanity to man. How he shows us what it means to be changed from a ""man"" to a ""thing"" deserves all the accolades he gets. As for the rest of the cast, it would have been easy to make them into ""types"" - the ""good"" slave-owner, the ""evil"" slave-owner, the ""evil"" slave-owner's wife, the beautiful slave-girl, the brutal overseer etc.. McQueen certainly does not do that here. With John Ridley, he has given the actors a chance to invest themselves into making a ""living"" document that really made me feel as if I was there. We all know that Cumberbatch, Dano, Fassbender, Giamatti and Paulson are pros and have added another excellent role to their respective c.v.s. The major discovery here is Lupita Nyong'o. We see her initially dancing in a free-spirited way that obviously attracts the lust of her owner and the hatred of the owner's wife and then we see her being broken. You would have to be made of stone not to shed tears at seeing the way this is done. Her ""Patsey"" will live long in anyone's memory and if justice were to be done then her performance will receive the highest awards. Watch out for her - she is a star.<br/><br/>As for the technical team, John Ridley wrote the right words, Sean Babbit is getting ready to step into the shoes of Sven Nykvist, Joe Walker's editing helped to make the unwatchable watchable and finally talking about the totally unexpected, Hans Zimmer, yes, HANS ZIMMER, wrote the music. So ""Best Film Ever"" - no. But sooo close... Now when I watch the ""slap"" scene in the film ""In the Heat of the Night"" I will truly understand what was going on and why it was such a shock. Thank you for that Mr McQueen."

","This film has just been released in the UK where I live. It has been released in the US for a few months and so I had read quite a lot about the film. Mostly I had read very good things and I found this film really lived up to the reputation it has been gathering.<br/><br/>Some reviews here have mentioned that the film has too much violence portrayed, but in fact, although there are some very harrowing scenes most of the film is a study of the corruption in the human nature that came from slavery. There is absolutely no gratuitous violence in this film.<br/><br/>Sometimes, in just a few brief moments, we are told an enormous amount about the way people managed the slave business emotionally. Early in the film a kidnapped slave is saved by an intervention of his actual ""owner"". The enslaved man is delighted to be released from his uncertain fate, presumably his real ""owner"" is not as cruel as others. His ""owner"" is a large man who upon receiving his slave back hugs his slave so the slave's head is brought close to his chest, he pats the slave on the head, and the slave has such a smile on his face. It has taken me a paragraph to describe this moment in the film and in truth I have in no way done it justice, but what struck me about this brief footage was how the enslaved man was like a pet to his owner. Even when the owner is presumably not a particularly cruel man the relationship between the slave and the owner is still an extraordinary subjugation for the enslaved man. I am reminded that slaves were kept ignorant, if they showed any signs of trying to educate themselves they would be punished.<br/><br/>All through the film these complexities of the corruption of relationships is revealed. One very cruel slave owner is habitually raping a female slave. His wife is fully aware and the consequences for the enslaved female are that she leads an appallingly difficult life. However her worst punishment comes when she has been to a neighbouring ranch to get some soap. This perceived infidelity by the owner brings on in him a tremendous rage with appalling consequences for the young woman.<br/><br/>There is absolutely tremendous footage of the scenery. The world in which the cruelty takes place is quite beautiful. There was something very striking about this. The beautiful views are indifferent to the corrupt and cruel world of slavery."

Steve McQueen is to be commended for his craft for he has created on screen a story both beautiful and terrible. <br/><br/>Yes there is violence and things that will make you uncomfortable but I really am not sure how you watch a tale of slavery without feeling some discomfort. <br/><br/>I think some people may have traded their misplaced guilt or shame for discomfort with violence. <br/><br/>The performances are some of the best I've seen on screen for the longest time. Nupita Nyong'o particularly is outstanding a Patsey a slave girl who receives the unwanted and obsessive attentions of a mentally ill master and his wife. Chiwetel performance is quiet but so commanding. Soloman is played with naivety and grace. <br/><br/>Don't be put off by the negative views and tales of violence.They malign the truth of the story and what is actually depicted on screen. <br/><br/>I am so glad that I went to see this important and well made film.

"mspolk2006","9","4","8","12 December 2013"," A review from someone who read the ""12 Years A Slave"" narrative
","I have seen both versions of this story committed to film. The 1984 version was directed by the great Gordon Parks (if you don't know who that is look him up). This film is beautiful, I have to say that from the very beginning; the footage of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana is gorgeous. The thing about this story isn't that is unique, what is unique is Solomon Northup enduring bondage for 12 years without becoming bitter. There are moments in this film when you cringe, I literally flinched in moments; the moments when I cried weren't as numerous as I thought. However the thing that is conveyed to the view is the strength of spirit that slaves had to endure in order to live, not just survive but live. There is a scene where Solomon is talking to Eliza about her open mourning for her children, when they start arguing about how best to survive this situation, Solomon yells at her ""I will stay hardy until freedom is opportune."" There are so many moments in this movie when I was just in awe of how they took this narrative and translated it into pictures, a narrative that doesn't require much imagination to bring you back to the mid-1800s and how it was to be on a plantation in Louisiana. Patsy, a slave who is her master's prized cotton picker, 500+ lbs of cotton a day, the master's relationship with her is to caress her with one hand and beat her with the other. Lupita Nyong, as Patsey, is so beautiful it broke my heart, when Master Epps is describe her as ""queen of the fields"",she turns away from him and for a moment, I saw the beauty of all those women who were stolen away from Africa, her profile was so classic. This movie had a conversation that was ""for movie purposes"" but Master Shaw, a neighboring planter has a 'kept' slave woman, played by Alfre Woodard, she entertains Patsey, though Master Epps is worried that Shaw will touch Patsey. Mistress Shaw, tells Patsey, in a calm but sober voice that I can only say gave me chills ""In His own time the good Lord will manage them all"". Master Epps wife, hates Patsey and refuses her the basic necessity, like soap for which Patsey takes a savage beating. Steve McQueen took this narrative that I have loved since I was in junior high school and managed to produce a piece of art from it. The funeral scene, where what I grew calling an ""old church mother"" sings ""Roll Jordon Roll""; which she pronounces 'Jerden', brought me back to Sundays in church, and I found myself singing with her in my heart. Finally, I wanted speak to the actual narrative and the man that Northup seemed to be in his narrative, he seemed a humble man, a kind man and that come through in this production. There is a scene toward the end of the film when Chiwetel Ejiofor looks into the camera, breaking that 'fourth wall' and all I could see was Solomon Northup staring at me across 160 years and I cried for him. Solomon's fate was lost to history, no one knows what became of him but I pray his last wish was granted."

","Numb,in tears, and shocked is how i felt while watching 12 Years a Slave. A lot of films are well made, a lot of films entertain there viewers and while leaving the theater those films are already forgot. But 12 years a Slave does not entertain, it shocks with its true content,it takes one to a world that was once true, many put a blind eye to SLAVERY, but it was once a reality.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is the story of Solomon Northup. Solomon a free black man in New York, in the 1800's, has a family, a wife 2 kids, he is living the good life. He then on the pretense of getting a job with a circus with a good pay goes to Washington with 2 men. The 2 men however get Solomon drunk,kidnap him and sell him away to white men for slavery. Solomon pleads, cries that he is a free man, but no ones hears. Here starts his journey of slavery, he gets beaten, he sees black women get raped, he is forced to work, he sees all his rights be abolished, he sees such horrible things happen to African American people which are unnameable, and completely disgusting. Does Solomon get freed,does he reunite with his family, does he fall prey to circumstance like all the other African American people around him.How he and many other African American people cope with slavery and its harsh, disgusting ways forms the main plot.<br/><br/>Acting wise the film has many marvelous performances but three performances stand out. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup is the films life line, he gives his lifes best, and the best performance of the year. One feels he is pain and agony in the film, and in the climax when Solomon cries, one also sheds a tear. Michael Fassbender as the slave ridden master, is menacing, he acts so well that one hates him on screen. Brad Pitt as the Canadian that believes in equality is a little stereotypical, but he has a important role, and adds a mature performance<br/><br/>A couple questions I asked myself after exiting the theater was WHY? Why was the life of a black man any less than a white man. Are not all human beings equal, does a color make such a difference. Who gave anybody the right to enslave a whole race, the right to beat them, rape them, make them work without pay etc mercifully... Slavery in America should not have ever happened,this is what this film explain, all humans are EQUAL.... The film preaches that we have to learn from our mistakes and make sure nothing even close to this happens again.<br/><br/>The film of the year, Director Steven Mcqueen get ready for the Oscars, thats the biggest complement i can give you, you made a path breaking film!!!!<br/><br/>A MUST WATCH FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS..."
"zardoz-13","9","4","8","17 November 2013"," A Powerful and Evocative Epic About Slavery in the Old South
","A searing indictment of chattel slavery in the antebellum South, ""12 Years a Slave"" depicts the tragic odyssey of a free-born African-American violinist shanghaied and sold into slavery by unscrupulous white chiselers. Solomon Northup's literary chronicle implicates himself as much for his own naivety as the avarice of the assailants who hoodwinked him for monetary gain. Two smooth-talking con artists in top-hats persuade our hero to leave the safety of New York so he can play his fiddle at a concert in Washington, D.C. They assure Northup that they will pay him handsomely for his services and reimburse him for any expenses incurred during the trip to and from the capitol. The surprises and shocks that ensue as a consequence of their mendacity turn Northup's life upside-down. British-born, black director Steve McQueen and ""Red Tails"" screenwriter John Ridley pull few punches in their largely realistic portrayal of Northup's exploits. They adapted Northup's eloquent autobiographical account of his captivity between 1841 and 1853. Of course, nobody should be flabbergasted that Northup's memoirs contain a far greater wealth of information than the film. Naturally, McQueen and Ridley had to eliminate some Northup's various adventures to make a movie under two-and-a-half-hours in length. Northup's hanging provides one clear example. Three bitter whites resolve to string up Northup until an overseer intervenes. In Northup's memoir, he was never actually hanged. In McQueen's film, Northup is hanged, but he manages to balance himself on the tip-toes until somebody cuts down. "" Mind you, this isn't the first time that Northup's horrific ordeal has been presented in the media. ""Shaft"" director Gordon Parks produced ""Solomon Northup's Odyssey"" back in 1984 for PBS's ""American Playhouse"" anthology television series. After its original telecast, the Parks' teleplay came out on home video as ""Half Slave, Half Free."" Inexplicably, McQueen had never heard about Solomon Northup and his plight when he was searching for a story to shoot about slavery. Unlike Parks and his ""American Playhouse"" production, Mc Queen and Ridley were not restrained by the straitlaced standards of television censorship. As much as ""12 Years a Slave"" is a yarn about courage in the face of wholly insurmountable odds, this Fox Searchlight release qualifies as a horror movie that provides little relief from our protagonist's travails until the end credits roll. Happily, McQueen doesn't paint all whites as unrepentant dastards. Indeed, our hero survives this adversity because compassionate whites stand up to unsavory whites. Nonetheless, for all but a quarter-hour of its running time, ""12 Years a Slave"" makes you abhor the individuals who abuse Solomon. The worst plantation owner of the bunch rapes his most productive black female slave repeatedly on a regular basis while his jealous wife dreams up schemes to drive the object of her husband's lust from their property.<br/><br/>Movies about Southern slavery, sometimes referred to as the ""peculiar institution,"" usually focus on slaves born into bondage. McQueen sought to make a film that would appeal to broader audience. Ridley and he found in Northup's memoir the perfect vehicle for this perspective. Since Northup had been born free, we can identify with him more than we might a poor soul who never possessed his freedom. Similarly, the same is true of those 18th century British sea-faring tales about helpless lads kidnapped by press gangs and forced into service by His Majesty's Government because they happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. In ""12 Years a Slave,"" two grifters posing as traveling entertainers appealed to Solomon's vanity as a musician to earn some quick, easy cash. When things seem too good to be true is when you should flee temptation. Solomon trusts these gentlemen implicitly, and they escort him to the nation's capitol. Once they arrive, they wine and dine him at an elegant restaurant and then slip him a Mickey Finn, the equivalent of the date rape drug Rohypnol, in his libation. When he entered Washington, Solomon was dressed as splendidly as any Caucasian gentleman. When he awakens the following morning on the outskirts of the capitol, Solomon finds himself attired in a night gown with a web of chains on both his wrists and ankles. When he protests his status as a free-born black, the slave traders whip him into submission with a wooden paddle. At this point, our hero winds up far from home in Louisiana where he must pick cotton, cut sugar cane, and grovel before his bull-whip wielding masters.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" lives up to its R-rating. The film contains considerable violence and cruelty, with extreme profanity as well as some nudity and brief sexuality. Various characters utter the politically incorrect N-word as many as 60 times in the company of other derogatory adjectives. The violence is far more disturbing than the sexuality. Nude scenes occur when the slaves must bathe before an auction. Similarly, when buyers inspect the slaves, they force them to strip naked. According to Northup's memoirs, slaves whose bodies bore the mark of the lash were not as easy to sell as slaves with unblemished bodies. A slave with too many scars was regarded as rebellious and considered poor prospect for sale. 12 Years a Slave"" makes the Hollywood classic ""Gone with the Wind"" look like a fairy tale. Although nobody suffers the loss of body parts as in the television mini-series ""Roots,"" the torture scenes where a female slave is lashed so badly that her back resembles a chopping board and male slaves are hoisted atop tree branches to hang until dead equal any of the ghastly horrors in Steven Spielberg 1993 Holocaust epic ""Schindler's List."" English actor Chiwetel Ejiofor of ""American Gangster"" gives an unforgettable performance as Solomon Northup who suffered untold terror at the hands of his sadistic captors. Naturally, as formidable as McQueen's film is, Solomon Northup's memoir is ten times more fascinating."

","Expecting to see some sort of race-baiting we-are-good-but-you-are-evil movie, I was very pleased that this is good stuff.<br/><br/>The movie is more about Northup's resiliency but also his inevitable slow slide into hopelessness than anything else. When he is finally rescued, it comes as a complete shock because he had given up fighting the system. And there is no shortage of white people in the film who are portrayed sympathetically. This is not a ""whitey has always hated us movie."" It is a tale of how a man with virtually everything going for him is reduced to crushing bondage by a legal system and culture.<br/><br/>The really bad people portrayed in the film are shown as being incapable of comprehending that blacks are in any way equal to whites. Grow up thinking such things and the likelihood you will have some sort of glorious epiphany is entirely unlikely.<br/><br/>Unlike Schindler's List, a movie that will cause you to look away, be glad you saw it, and swear you will never see it again because of its gut-wrenching images, 12 Years was watchable for me. It is a movie. Everyone and their grandchildren involved are long gone. The Peculiar Institution is gone. No one in the US has been a slave-holder or a slave.<br/><br/>He was saved because people who were consistently good, mostly white people, were able to overcome people who were consistently evil, also white people.<br/><br/>I went in expecting a movie with a heavy-handed message but that was well-acted and was pleasingly surprised that the movie was well-acted, well-staged, and void of any sort of political message.<br/><br/>I have heard people, the same sort who say the Holocaust never happened, claim that the story is nearly complete fabrication. Unlike The Butler, which is about as true to reality as Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, this one holds up well to historical scrutiny. Keep in mind that histories are always written by the winners, in this case the Abolitionists. But the fact that SN spoke kindly of two of his masters tends to poke holes in the theory that this is just another Uncle Tom's Cabin.<br/><br/>I take that back. There is a political message. That message is that government can do anything it wants with you and you are essentially powerless. SN was enslaved by the system but rescued by individuals."

Its poetic filmmaking, told through the characters emotions and impeccable attention to detail, not a single frame of digital celluloid wasted, each shot a perfectly framed heart-wrenching photo. While some consider it slow and it will inescapably sit heavy on its viewer's minds, ""12 Years"" is the most personal, beautiful and accurate portrait of slavery in film history.<br/><br/>This is the true story of Solomon Northup (Ejiofor), a free man who was captured and sold into slavery in 1841. It covers the entirety of his 12 year slave-life, yet never struggles with this epic scope, bringing clarity to the characters and their motives. We meet many people along Solomon's path, each presenting the varied and confused relationships that existed between slaves and slave-owners. Pitt is a perfect wise old sage. Giamatti, Dano and Fassbender are revelatory and terrifying. Ejiofor brings literal chills to his performance, leaving us feeling bound with Northup. Most importantly, the film refuses to make any of these characters caricatures. We are forced to sympathize, or at least understand, all characters and their actions.<br/><br/>This is not a fun movie. It's probably not a movie people will want to re-watch. The bigotry this film reminds us of is almost otherworldly, and McQueen has no interest in making us comfortable with it; he intends to poke and prod at our sense of humanity and succeeds at every jab.

","12 Years a Slave is a movie that everyone should see. It is what I consider to be a perfect film, and there are not many that I would categorize as such. It is a masterpiece of cinema, creating a powerful, meaningful experience for those who are fortunate enough to see it. The acting is phenomenal, particularly on the part of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender, who both deserve at least nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Supporting Actor respectively at the Academy Awards. Steve McQueen also deserves at least a nomination for Best Director. The movie should definitely win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. If it does not, then I have lost faith in the Academy. It is by far the best movie that has come out this year, and one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen a lot. This movie is profound and is not less than extraordinary.

","The intensity of this story had me awestruck throughout the film, to the degree that I was unable to show any emotion as I watched a depiction of slavery that showed how those who had gained freedom or were born free were systematically and strategically kidnapped and forced back into it. This film showed a different side of injustice. Not only was I amazed at how black people were treated in that era under such circumstances, I was amazed and hurt at how black people treated each other. When some may have considered Solomon Northrop to be weak, he was truly courageous. He kept his mind more positive than a lot of people could under those circumstances. Although he did work as a slave, there was always a glimmer of the determination of a free man within him, destined to escape the life he was forced into. Northrop was always seeking an opportunity to gain assistance from those willing to listen and was cunning enough to adapt and protect himself when betrayed by those he trusted. This film was well written, well acted, thought provoking and historically relevant. Steve McQueen and Brad Pitt took a chance with this film and in my opinion it paid off well. If you're offended by the use of the n-word (ala Spike Lee), then you may want to stay home or see something else. Without the use of the word, it would be historically inaccurate. The film doesn't just show us injustices of our past, but they bring a perspective to the present and hope for the future. I would recommend this movie to be included in African American History classes in schools across the country. Doing so may show young black people that we have a history of being determined and that many people have lived worse than we could ever imagine in our modern times. If you didn't leave the theater touched or enlightened to treat each other better and at the same time honor those who came before us by appreciating the opportunities afforded to us, you should watch it again until you do. *Side note: the audience at the theater where I saw this film was predominantly white Americans, all of whom were in tears midway through the film. This film is for all Americans. When we know better, we can do better*"

","I watched this last night and I'm still trying to pull my thoughts together on it. I'd heard a lot of hype about the movie, with people declaring it to be the best picture of 2013 and an Oscar winner several months into last year, and I probably walked into the theatre mentally challenging 12 Years A Slave to live up to that hype. I actually didn't think that it would. I mean, how could it? <br/><br/>But it did.<br/><br/>I honestly can't remember the last time I was this devastated whilst sitting in a movie theatre.<br/><br/>I guess that's probably due to the movies I tend to see there, which place spectacle above characterisation and dramatic weight, but this movie broke me. I was fine for the first two thirds, admiring the editing and mentally applauding the fantastic acting on display, but the final third of the movie finally reached inside and just tore something out. By the time we had reached poor Patsy begging her master for soap just so she could clean herself, I realised that I was actually crying. From that point onward, I no longer felt like an observer but someone who had walked those painful years with Solomon, and I shed more tears as we reached that final apology, and that swelling music, and the cards telling us how Solomon Northup was denied justice and that the date, location and circumstances of his death were unknown. That text was almost as bad as anything I had been confronted with prior to its appearance; the mere thought that this great man - who had endured so much and been witness to such unspeakable things, who hung from a rope and came back from it, whose time as a husband and a father was snatched away by a single mistake - had vanished without a trace from the Earth saddened me greatly. <br/><br/>I've not seen any of McQueen's other movies and will now, of course, remedy that. This was a difficult movie but one I'm glad to have experienced, even though it chiselled away at a little piece of my soul. It's a testament of how terrible humans can be to one another, but also how great film can truly be in the right hands, as it's a medium which can achieve many things but here, in 12 Years A Slave, it is used for the highest of purposes; to entertain, to elevate, and to educate. I did not know Solomon Northup's story before I watched this film but now i will never forget it and, if this does become an Oscar winner as so many have predicted, it will be one of the few cases in which that award ceremony got something absolutely right."
"browha","5","5","11","8 January 2014"," Great topic, great acting, poor film
","Maximum spoilers alert.<br/><br/>I thought this film was pretty bad. The acting was fantastic - full credit to the cast - but the way the story was conveyed was amateurish at best. The whole family/freedom thing played about a 3-5 minute role in a film of 2 hours and 15 minutes - and there was no 'pre-kidnap' development of the character to humanise him and let you empathise with him. When it should have been fast, it was slow, and when it should have been slow, it was fast.<br/><br/>A remake of this should have ~30 minutes at the start just to ease into the film and develop the character, and let the audience really empathise with what he was losing in life. Key scenes later on were good but were cut with too many filler scenes to be fully utilised. The ending was also quite anti-climatic, leaving the reunion too brief to even qualify for 'brief but sweet'.<br/><br/>It's saddening as this post will probably be taken as some racist hatred thing, when in fact it's just a review of the director. This film could have been so much better, but sadly this is an opportunity missed."
"edgereviews","10","5","11","8 January 2014"," The Best Slavery Movie of All Time?
","Steve McQueen's last movie,'Shame', was one of the best films of 2011. It was very hard-hitting and difficult to watch at times, serving as a brilliant depiction of how sex can affect and manipulate relationships and lifestyles. When it was announced McQueen was making a movie about slavery, I prepared myself for it to be much the same but about slavery instead of sex. It turns out I wasn't prepared, as 12 Years A Slave is one of the most emotionally devastating movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I at first thought that I perhaps wouldn't be as engaged with 12 Years because I knew the outcome, after all it's not very hard to work out, just look at the title and you'll get a good idea. It turns out I was wrong, as when watching 12 Years I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Even when there are disgusting acts being shown that are very difficult to watch, I kept looking because there's so much tension. As usual McQueen doesn't use short, snappy constant cuts, he includes lots of long shots which greatly add to the tension of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal. Chiwetel Ejiofor is incredible as Solomon Northup, bringing a level of depth and emotion to the character that few actors could. I wouldn't be surprised if Ejiofor took a leading actor Oscar, and I think Michael Fassbender stands a good chance of getting a supporting actor win. He's outstanding in his role as a slaver, making the character completely despicable and also showing the severe mental and psychological problems that this person clearly had. The supporting cast all do excellent jobs as well, including Lupita Nyong'o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>12 Years features a beautiful score from Hans Zimmer, and Steve McQueen does a perfect job directing. There have been lots of films about slavery recently, but none are as jarring and harrowing as 12 Years. This is the first time in any slave movie I've ever felt true disgust towards slave owners and traders. Perhaps that's because I know 12 Years is based on a true story, so while other movies show fictional slavers, the ones in this movie were real. McQueen doesn't stray from showing the agony and suffering these people were put through, and I think that's for the better. There's no point in showing muted violence to try and cover up the past, let us see the true horrors we inflicted upon ourselves many years ago so it may never happen again. It's reasons like this that make 12 Years A Slave such an important movie; it's the 'Schindlers List' of slavery movies and it's essential you watch it as it will live on for decades to come."

"cadillac20","9","5","11","2 November 2013"," An Unflinching Look At Human Brutality Driven By Fantastic Performances
","The slavery of blacks in the US is one of the darkest periods of the history of the country. And yet, it's easy to forget that it not only is such an ingrained part of US history, one that helped build it's foundations, but a piece of history that lasted a long period of time. In fact, the issue is less than 200 years old, and according to history, that's not a long time. So, a film like 12 Years is a deep reminder of not only how far we have come along, but of who we once were and who we can yet again become. <br/><br/>Based on the true story of Solomon Northup, we follow the man from the time he is kidnapped and forced into slavery. Based on the book of the same name, written by Northup himself, it's clear where the film eventually goes, but the journey is like little else in film that has dealt with the subject. No doubt this film will get much comparison to Tarantino's Django, which also dared to show slavery in a gloves off kind of way, but this is a film that deals with slavery in a much less entertaining or satisfactory fashion. Rather, the film is brutal and does not shy away from being ugly and emotionally charged. And while we may be quick to jump on this as being obvious and typical, it is anything but.<br/><br/>Northup's story is unique enough as it is. He's one of a few kidnapped, freed slaves to ever regain freedom, but he also manages to give a personal account. As Northup, Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent. He handles the character with a great deal of emotional layer and considering the brutal and realistic nature of the film, it's hard to imagine many who could take on such a brave role. But even beyond this being just another film about slavery, McQueen goes the extra length to depict the film in such a fashion that we are almost forced to feel something. There's a scene about halfway through in which Northup is left roped up with only his tiptoes to keep him from hanging. During this scene, McQueen carries the image in a single shot for several minutes, what seems to stretch into an eternity, during which everything around Northup all but ignores him. Slaves go about their day, while the slave drivers don't budge an inch to help. As Ejiofor is obviously not choking here in real life, it is to his credit that we are convinced he is suffering for such an extended period of time. And the rest of the performance carries on as such.<br/><br/>The other performers are also quite good, but a number of them are relegated to small appearances. Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbacth, Paul Dano, and Brad Pitt all make brief appearances and are all excellent in their roles, but they are still brief and mostly one dimensional. Nothing new to a film about slavery. McQueen, however, manages to pump up the tension and emotion in the scenes by giving us an unfiltered look at slavery here. No punches are pulled. However, the runaway performance, by far, with the exception of Ejiofor, is Michael Fassbender, who plays Edwin Epps, a plantation owner who makes no qualms about driving his slaves and punishing them. He's cruel, and Fassbender truly makes him a monster of a man. Fassbender has gone on record for not wanting to push an Oscar nomination, and it's no wonder. Fassbender's Epps could be considered one of the great villains of the year for being such a despicable human being, but the fact that he is played to reality, as opposed to DiCaprio's more cartoonish Calvin Candy, makes him all the more frightening. When he engages with his slaves, you genuinely fear for their safety, and even their life. <br/><br/>Another star here is the cinematography. There are some truly beautiful shots here, which can only help to remind you of just how ugly the topic of the film is. I did talk a bit about the long shots here before, but to elaborate, there are moments when the camera is content to focus on something. The film certainly doesn't come off as speeding along, and it lends to being thoughtful, even in just focusing on the emotional state of the characters. There is an interesting shot that focuses on Northup's emotionally drained face, and you grasp a lot in that single shot. All in one, we witness a man who is driven by deep sorrow and pain, and yet he has had his hope and spirit driven from him. Though it's evident he wants to cry, it's almost as if he has been completely defeated. <br/><br/>12 Years truly is the film people say it is and may very well be one of the most important films on slavery ever created. It's depiction is raw and unflinching and there is little choice but to confront the ugliest humanity has to offer. Not an easy film to watch, nor entertaining, it is none the less important and well made. Worth watching simply for it's powerful performances and take on the subject at hand."

","Steve McQueen's 'Twelve Years a Slave' is not exactly a bad film; but I confess to a certain disappointment in it. McQueen's earlier movies, 'Shame' and especially 'Hunger', were raw, visceral portrayals of life under a certain sort of inescapably grim reality. But 'Twelve Years a Slave', while it contains many horrific moments, is basically full Hollywood, with emotional background music underscoring the emotions we're meant to feel, and a narrative that stresses the possibility of the individual triumphing against evil and misfortune through strength of character alone. Of course, this is a common solution, because depicting unameliorated misery could make for a grim movie: the audience prefers 'The Shaswhank Redemption' to a story ending in prison suicide, or 'Schindler's List' to a drama actually set in the camps. But McQueen has previously skirted the thin line between truth and unwatchability with considerable skill: this outing, though made with a much bigger budget, is a less ambitious effort."
"lnwalker11","8","2","3","21 December 2014"," Excellent portrayal of the reality of slavery
","12 Years a Slave is about a free African American who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. The movie demonstrates the significant amount of hardships, and in great detail the severe mistreatment's the slaves received during the years of slavery. The main character Solomon Northup is sold into slavery where he is no longer considered a person but but a piece of property. Throughout his 12 years as a slave he's sold to a few different slave owners, each one being harsher than the last. The movie showed the harsh treatment the slaves received like constantly being whipped, rapped, hanged and even late night dancing. Solomon continuously received these harsh mistreatment's, especially from the slave owner Edwin Epps. However, there were a few kinder slave owners he encountered. For example, one of the slave owners recognized Solomon's talent for playing the violin and even bought him his own violin so he could escape the hardships of slavery for a little while.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Solomon has flashbacks of his previous life, where he was free, and had a steady career. These constant flashbacks are what give him the hope to survive and dream that he might escape the jaws of slavery. Along his journey he tries to write several letters to his family, so that he could become free again, however his letters always failed to get sent someway or another. In fact, he even tried paying a white guy to send his letter for him, but this also failed to get sent. However, Solomon makes a deal with a white man that the white man will do everything he can to spread the word of Solomon's enslavement to his family. Which he eventually does, and escapes Solomon from slavery. <br/><br/>The director Steve McQueen did an excellent job producing this movie. He clearly portrayed the emotion and harsh reality of slavery. When I watched this movie, it was very emotional because I felt like I was part of the movie and when a slave was whipped I imagined being in their shoes, and feeling the intense pain the slaves were experiencing. Steve McQueen's clever use of imagery and screen shots also helped to complete this movie and prove to the public that slavery really did happen, and that it was awful. His movie makes the viewer feel horrible because they can't help but think that they let this happen to poor innocent human beings. It also signifies how wrong people were that blacks weren't people, that they didn't have feelings and that splitting up their families was okay. It makes me sick to know that at one point we did this to them, and that nobody did anything to stop it. Overall, the movie 12 Years a Slave is an exceptional example of the hardships the slaves endured during slavery."

","This film is based on the 1853 autobiography by Solomon Northup who was born as a free black man in New York state but was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the south.<br/><br/>While I highly recommend this film, I do so with qualification. Some scenes of torture are very harrowing and disturbing. Naturally, this raises the point that if it is so difficult to watch such simulations, how difficult must it have been to live through such torment?<br/><br/>The story-line is always engaging as it is often difficult to predict what will happen next. One surprise is that, while some slave owners are downright evil, others show glimpses of humanity. Director Steve McQueen showed great power with his other two films ""Hunger"" and ""Shame"". Adding ""12 Years a Slave"" to this fine list makes McQueen one of my favourite modern directors.<br/><br/>This film has three great performances who rightly won accolades. As the main character, Chiwetel Ejiofor is the perfect anchor. His final scene is such a powerful summary of all he has endured, it could bring tears from even the coldest of hearts. In the role of Patsey, a fellow slave who is terribly abused, Lupita Nyong'o is heartbreaking. Michael Fassbender is gripping as he personifies insanity and wickedness as a slave owner. Fassbender has performed in McQueen's other two films. This is clearly already one of moviedom's great collaborations and I look forward to more films from them.<br/><br/>There were occasional moments of confusion but too few to dilute the effect of this great film. It is nearly miraculous that this story could be told more than a century and a half after being published. It could only have been told because Northup was already literate before his experience as a slave. As most other slaves were kept illiterate, their personal stories could sadly never be told.<br/><br/>There were no satisfying revenge scenes such as those in ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Help"" (where racist abuse continues post-slavery), but its truth-telling should no doubt change minds and hearts.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10<br/><br/>Outstanding Achievement: Directing by Steve McQueen"
"bmennen","6","14","43","19 October 2013"," It was profound, but not that good...
","Chiwetel Ejiofor delivered his usual brilliant performance; he is one of the most compelling leading men around. McQueen has a great eye, and the cinematographer captures his vision. The film is often beautiful.<br/><br/>And yet...and yet...the screenplay (some of the characters sound as if they are in a Shakespearean play) is uneven, crushingly slow at some points, and the acting of several of the secondary characters is, in some cases, not good. McQueen should have done additional takes rather than let some of those early scenes stand. At any rate, he does not seem to be an actor's director.<br/><br/>And, while the subject of slavery in the US is a deep subject, the film seemed hollow; there was no real attempt at character development or background. <br/><br/>Back to Ejiofor. Without him, the movie would be a 3 or 4."
"Figgy66-915-598470","10","4","9","5 February 2014"," Not for the faint hearted but watching should be compulsory
","5 February 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - 12 Years a Slave. Based on the true story of Solomon Northup, this powerful and disturbing film is a sharp lesson in how awful man can be to fellow man. Solomon is a free black man from New York who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. He encounters dreadful cruelty and yet stumbles across a little kindness. Superbly shot, this film drags you into the pure desperation felt by the slaves at the utter hopelessness of their situation. It is a film that will remove you far from your comfort zone, and given the subject, so it should, as it drags you into the epic battle to stay alive and to face every single day knowing how awful it will be, and not knowing if you ever see the sunrise of the next day. Solomon is played by Chitwetel Ejiofor with a compassion that is mesmerising, and his cruel owner Michael Fassbender attacks his role with such passion that I could feel the hatred oozing from his pores. An unexpected role for Brad Pitt which suited him well and gave an insight into just how well he can act when the role truly suits him. I would be very surprised if this film doesn't win something at the Oscars even with it's disturbing theme, no matter how uncomfortable these stories are, they are stories that need to be told."
"bschmidt1996","9","4","9","22 January 2014"," Difficult to take, but a masterpiece nonetheless!
","Steve McQueen has done something truly remarkable here. I loved ""Django Unchained"" to death purely for Quentin Tarantino's style, but this is the slavery film of the century. This is the most remarkable film to tackle slavery that I've ever seen. It's handled with such realism and uncompromising power that it's very difficult to handle at times. I know, being white myself, that I felt such an overwhelming feeling of shame while watching it, and I think that's entirely due to McQueen's passion and drive.<br/><br/>There are scenes in this film, one scene in particular, where you want him to cut away, but he doesn't. It's almost as if McQueen is there in the theater with you; holding your eyes open and saying ""No. Watch."" There's a lashing scene early on in the film that is particularly disturbing, mostly due to the mind-blowing performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, which I'll speak more about later. McQueen stays on this one shot where you can see the pain Ejiofor's face, the unfiltered rage of the man doing the lashing, and the brutal impact of the board and the belt on Ejiofor's back. It's disturbing and unsettling, but unquestionably brilliant.<br/><br/>Now onto my favorite aspect of the film, the performances. Wow! That's the only word I can think of to properly describe the tour de force work by the entire cast. This cast is a wet dream for a filmmaker: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Brad Pitt, and the list goes on and on. However, the most impressive of this host of masters was Ejiofor. He steals the show in a way that I can't possibly put into words. I'm man enough to admit that he actually made me cry, which isn't easy to do in movies. The weight of the screenplay and the power of the performances combined together was something to marvel at. Some of the best acting work I've seen all year. Although I do still hold to my statement that DiCaprio in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" was the best lead performance of the year.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was perfect. The directing, the performances, the writing, the editing, the cinematography. This is literally a perfect biopic. I'm going to do something I never ever do, I'm going to redact my statement that ""Wolf of Wall Street"" was the best film of 2013. This is a masterpiece that will live on forever! I just can't believe what I just witnessed! An amazing experience!"
"Mattissimplythebest","10","4","9","20 January 2014"," An important and better than worthy film
","First and foremost this is a tale of such soulful and poetic power that it is (I believe) impossible to watch it without being affected on an emotional level. In other hands this story might have appeared to the viewer as more of a strict sermon on the evils of slavery, with an overemphasis on melodrama perhaps and a fair amount of ""worthy"" speech making. It is, after all, awards season and the cynic in me cannot help but look around each year and pick out the formula ""Oscar gold"" winners and lament the presence of a film which deserves them. Here though we finally have something to shred all that cynicism away, because at its core, 12 Years a Slave is allowed to unravel with a seamlessness and natural poignancy rarely found in modern film.<br/><br/>It is not very often that the camera, in this day and age, is allowed to linger on such small details as an actors face and the emotions they are feeling. It is perhaps even rarer to find leading actors capable of dealing with that kind of close up scrutiny, who are then able deliver a performance worthy of the unforgiving nature of the never ceasing examination of the camera lens. Great credit must therefore go to Director Steve McQueen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender collectively, for leading and performing to such a high standard amongst other splendid performances.<br/><br/>It is a cinematic piece which has elements of Terence Mallick, which is a point I have taken from a review I heard on BBC Radio 5 Live - but most importantly, there is no other film, to my mind, that is like it. In the two and a bit hours of watching, you will be taken through all the wrongs and evils of a time in World history, that is little talked about and which is deserving of prominent coverage to throw a little light into those dark recesses of human conscience. It is a rare privilege to be seated in a cinema for a film which I think will be studied and reviewed again many times over in the course of the next decade or more.<br/><br/>If anyone ever makes a better film about the subject of Slavery, I will eat my hat with relish!"
"TiagoRicardo","9","4","9","19 January 2014"," A powerful story about slavery
","At last I had the chance to watch Steve McQueen's adaptation of the Solomon Northup's book ""12 Years a Slave"". Solomon Northup (brilliantly interpreted by Chiwetel Ejiofor) lived in New York with his family (his wife and his two kids). His life was stable, he was a free black man living the ""American Dream"", until he was invited to join two other men to preform in several places, since he was a brilliant violinist. But unfortunately for him, the invitation was just the beginning of the worst time of his entire life. Solomon ended abducted and sold into slavery. While being a slave, Solomon faced the cruelty of some white men who just treat them like their property and a series of events that are really tough to watch. In fact, there are only a few things that are easy to watch in this 2-hour drama. Fassbender's character was really powerfully and I must confess that there were times where I was really angry about it. So much power and greed drove him to complete madness. Fassbender was really great portraying a slave owner, giving a huge touch of cruelty and evil to the film. It was really hard for me to imagine how could someone treat another one with such amount of cruelty. Without only a little amount of hope, Solomon sees him self trapped in this ""nightmare"" and tries to survive to the whole thing. After long years of suffering, Solomon sees at last the opportunity to escape after meeting a Canadian abolitionist, Bass, interpreted by Brad Pitt. This powerful and tough drama is also filled with brilliant performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and Lupita Nyong'o. Hans Zimmer also strikes again with a really great soundtrack that involves the audience into the film. But there is a lot more in ""12 Years a Slave"" than just slavery. I left the theater in complete silence, astonished for what I had just seen. A message of hope, a portrait of the cruelty of men and a powerful story that is tough but also captivating. Steve McQueen really got me with this one. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a 2- hour drama that will shock you and that sometimes will make you feel angry but there is so much substance in this film that it is impossible for me no to advise you to go and watch it. ""12 Years a Slave"" is more than a must-see, it is a true masterpiece!"
"jackasstrange","8","4","9","10 January 2014"," A masterpiece!
","Perhaps, Masterpiece is the appropriate term to refers to this film. A work of art that may, and must be remembered in the next years. It has the touch of a talented director and a touching, detailed script and also a great soundtrack (always with Hans Zimmer) and an exceptional cast. Some films have all these things but the result is exactly the opposite: a big disappointment. <br/><br/>In fact, a film that has all these resources end being either a masterpiece or a disappointment. But this one you can be sure it's a masterpiece. The term sounds too pompous, I know, but I don't care. The film is what it is, and shall not be referred as anything lower. Obviously, you want to know what is so great about it, and I offered the key words, and without spoilers I'll explain why. <br/><br/>The script don't has that much of a deeper meaning or what's ever, but it is as strong as anything else. It has a simple message, that it's delivered in a powerful way. Surmount and faith. It explains a bit the slaves mentality in the age, and there is a line in the film that explain it all – of course not going to spoil it; all I can say is that is a great one liner – that would sound cliché under other circumstances, but not in the film – why? – well, the difference is it's about real life here, fellas. <br/><br/>The life of the protagonist, Salomon(masterfully interpreted by Chiwetel Ejiofor), it's really touching. And what it's most impressive about the story is how many details is put on it. It's even difficult to follow sometimes every single detail, but this is improved in re-watches. Faces expressions, the sounds of the insects, the breeze in the grass, the slaves cutting the reed, the sun radiating against the trees...everything is shown in details. You can even feel the land. The art direction is used carefully. The acting in general, indeed excellent. Top performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor, which literally brought Solomon to life, and brilliant in the over dramatic scenes; Michael Fassbender, that was perfect as the cold, harmless and somewhat coward villain; and Lupita Nyong'o, though she was one of the weakest in the cast, but her performance was good anyways. Also excellent were Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano and the always excellent no matter what, Paul Giamatti. It no matter if it will win the Oscars or not it's already the best film of the year, and one of the best of this century, and also of all times. No kidding. Watch that film. 10/10"
"jasonbustamante20","10","4","9","18 November 2013"," One of the best films this year, definitely the front runner in the Best Picture race and other races this Oscar season
","12 years a slave is hands down the best film I've seen this year. Steve McQueens best work yet. In my opinion this film just nudges Gravity to second in the best picture race so far, still waiting for the much anticipated releases of ""American Hustle"", ""The Wolf on Wall Street"", ""Saving Mr. Banks"", and ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"". <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor gives his best performance yet(definitely Oscar worthy) playing Solomon Northup, a freeman who is kidnapped into the slave trade. He brought emotion and courage to the screen while leaving the audience on their toes predicting what he was going to do next. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbander also gives an Oscar worthy performance playing the antagonist, Edwin Epps, a drunken repulsive plantation owner. While Solomon brings the innocence and desperation to the movie Edwin brings the intensity and evil to the movie. These two powerhouse actors create the perfect contradiction and it simply makes the movie great and brings it off the screen into the audience. <br/><br/>Along with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbander are Lupita N'Yongo, Benedict Cumberbatch,Brad Pitt,Paul Dano, Sarah Paulson, and Paul Giamatti make up the star studded cast. The way Steve McQueen directed the movie this cast barely shares screen time and there is no interference between their talents. The most intriguing performances, aside from the leads, (Chiwetel, Fassbander,and Nyongo'o) were from Paul Dano and Brad Pitt they stole the lead when they were on the screen. Paul Dano plays the very racist, abusive Master Tibeats who usually spends his time hitting the slaves. Paul shares the screen with Benedict Cumberbatch they are also a perfect combination and contrast of good and evil. Brad Pitt plays the hardworking, humble Bass who travels around North America working on construction. Brad shares the screen with the two leads, Chiwetel and Fassbander, which he stabilizes the conflicts between the two and the topic of slavery.<br/><br/>Throughout the film the recurring conflict is between good and evil, and what is right and wrong, all on the topic of slavery and Solomon's unusual, tough situation. Steve McQueen and the writers blended it in with the characters very well.<br/><br/>Along with the great acting, directing, and writing there is the music that compliments of every aspect of the film perfectly and Hans Zimmer is also deserving of an Oscar.<br/><br/>To wrap everything up 12 years a slave is a great movie it completely caught me off guard and it should be the big name floating around on Oscars night. The star studded cast is perfectly gelled with the directing of Steve McQueen and the writing by John Ridley. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes to be entertained and appreciates the aspects of movies.<br/><br/>10/10 great film"
"katie-uno","10","4","9","18 November 2013"," A Masterpiece
","Before going to see this film, I knew that I could expect amazing performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender. Don't get me wrong, their performances were nothing shy of breathtaking and extraordinary. However, it is not simply these two actors that made this film one of the greatest masterpieces of our time. Every single actor and actress's performance was spot on. The beautiful cinematography and editing created amazing moments that allowed the audience to really think about and empathize with what the characters were experiencing. I am extremely grateful that despite the numerous famous faces, the film did not assign favor to them and did not have extra, purposeless shots simply for added screen time. Instead, it prioritized the story and the characters/events that helped to progress that story. All these aspects are a testament to Steve McQueen's outstanding directing.<br/><br/>Although every part of this film was noteworthy, I cannot leave without heralding the highest acclaim for Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance. I would be extremely surprised if Chiwetel Ejiofor did not take home Best Actor for every award this upcoming season. {SPOILER} Ejiofor was simply awe-inspiring just from the last few scenes depicting his rescue/freedom themselves. His final scene in the film where he is finally reunited with his family brought me to tears that lasted well after the credits had finished rolling."

","12 Years a Slave. WOW. Brilliant, powerful, while also being incredibly difficult to watch. I've never felt so deeply, watching a film.

I'm not going to lie: I cried, like, more than once.<br/><br/>For those who appreciate such things, it's technically brilliant as well. The directing, the acting, the cinematography, the score. Unbelievable. What a cast! It's going to win so many eff-ing awards. Just off the top of my head, best picture, best director, best actor (Chiwetel Ejiofor - superb), best adapted screen play, maybe best supporting actor (Michael Fassbender), maybe supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o), maybe best cinematography and score. The record for most Oscars for a single film is 11 (shared by Ben Hur, Titanic, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King). I will be interested to see if 12 Years a Slave makes a run at that.<br/><br/>This isn't just the best movie of the year, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.

It is brilliant storytelling without the hand-holding musical cues and editing tricks that trigger the viewer's emotional responses. Scenes play themselves out in a painterly way, letting the moviegoer's gaze take hold. The viewer enters this film in a way few if any contemporary films allow. You are there. And there, the deep South, was an evil place. Where does evil reside? In a time when many feel we've lost our moral compass comes a film that can serve as a compass.

"tjhill93","10","4","9","1 November 2013"," The Greatest Horror Film Ever Made
","""12 years a Slave"" is quite possibly the greatest horror film ever made. Somewhat in the same vain as a Hitchcock masterpiece where an innocent main gets kidnapped and abducted then the plot thickens. But in this case he is thrown into slavery. Once the story arch arrives at him being and realizing he is a slave it quickly becomes a series of events of immense suffering. Beatings, hangings, rape and intense psychological torment all follow. But it's not just torture porn. All scenes with excruciating pain are framed with an almost nihilistic and dispassionate eye. <br/><br/>The suspense arrives when you begin to anticipate the next agonizing act. McQueen's direction has scary continuous long shots that depict the harsh reality of American slavery. There is one long shot of a possible hanging that left me in a dark trance. The movie's sonic landscape is full of atmospheric drones, violins, and old Negro spirituals. The acting is impeccable. The pacing is brilliant, you feel the deep weight of time. All aspects lead toward creating an immovable sense of dread.<br/><br/>With Hunger(harrowing depiction of the Bobby Sands hunger strike), Shame (disturbing depiction of a sex addict), and 12 Years A slave(depiction of slavery). Steve McQueen has become a post modern horror film savior."
"Chris_Kirk","Null","3","6","26 June 2017"," Violence without insight
","The film's brutal and noble depiction of American slavery being unjust seemingly makes the film impervious to criticism. I happen to agree that slavery is an abomination, but I don't think that is a question being discussed in America or the world at the moment. As far as I know, it is a question that has been answered already. But the Academy can't help but pat themselves on the back because they have, for the first time, given their Best Picture award to a film written and directed by black filmmakers. Instead of feeling proud, I may instead wonder why they haven't been giving awards to filmmakers of diversity all these years. I suppose they are an American institution and they focus on American films and films that engage with the American sensibility. In this case they have chosen to acknowledge an issue which has largely been sorted in the American cultural mind. <br/><br/>I suppose it is a long process rewriting history to include the stories of the marginalised. This is a process that needs to happen, and for many people this is a process that needs to happen in large-scale accessible films that will be seen by many. Thus the film has its place.<br/><br/>However, the film doesn't offer any depth into the situation. There is no insight achieved into how this could happen, what toxic ideologies justified this culture on a political or a personal level. There was no attempt to place this man's experience into any large context at all. It was merely a depiction of the nobility of waiting for justice. For 12 years he worked as a slave and barely dared confront the legal injustice of his situation, let alone the moral injustice of it. He nobly waited for 12 years and eventually justice was done and he was able to return home to his family.<br/><br/>Titles at the end of the film not only tell us that the kidnappers were not brought to justice, but that the protagonist's salvation was extremely anomalous. Most free black people sold into slavery illegally were never freed. But that is not an inspiring story of overcoming adversity. That is a more accurate rewriting of American history to include the stories of marginalised, but not one that reinforces American values of waiting for things to get better, waiting for justice to have an opportunity to be done.<br/><br/>The violence of this film did not offer us a rewarding and insightful commentary on the grotesque cultural and political landscape of America that allowed slavery to flourish for so long."

","Alright, by saying this movie has no action, of course, this kinda movie won't really have the same action as a movie about super heroes. But there was literally nothing interesting about this movie, it was very slow paced, with only a couple of good scenes. Although the movie was incredibly well filmed and had great scenery, landscapes and everything from that aspect was very well taken care of. But the story as a whole didn't really seem appealing. The ending was kinda random as well, wanted to see more in-depth background of the slave owners, maybe other slaves, but it was only centered around Solomon, which is fine, but for a movie that long, it gets a little bit too boring and hard to sit-through. The story could have been way more diverse, hence making the movie more complex and so straight forward, after watching it you literally have nothing to think about, just like .. meh, a cool movie."
"powermandan","3","3","6","29 October 2014"," Ejiofor Saves A Pointless Stinkfest.
","12 Years A Slave won the Oscar for Best Picture this year. If this was released, say, 25 years ago, this would have received little praise and won very little awards. That just shows how far downhill Hollywood has gone. I can see why people would love it, but place this years ago and nobody would. What is wrong with this? A well-respected black man (Ejiofor) is kidnapped and sold into slavery where he must witness and be victimized to extreme cruelty by his owners. Other than showing how brutal slavery can be, there is no point and the film goes nowhere. Just Negroes getting beaten throughout the whole movie because they can. I know that this movie is supposed to be hard to watch, but that's no excuse to leave important film components out. Pay It Forward was sad, but it has theme, it gets somewhere, there is plot development. 2007's The Girl Next Door had a theme, the plot actually went somewhere. 12 Years A Slave just didn't have a point or story. Django Unchained is a slavery movie that actually gets places. 12 years just repeats the same thing for over two hours. Wolf of Wall Street was more worthy of an Oscar win than this and Gravity, because it actually has a story that unfolds.<br/><br/>However, everybody did a mighty fine job of acting. Since Ejiofor is the main character, it is only natural that he would be the best. In fact, I think that he gave the best performance of the year. Sure DiCaprio and McConoughey were worthy, but this is the kind of acting that always moves people the most. Plus people rave this as being the best film of the year, so him not winning was a surprise. But McCounoghey was worthy and I'm glad he won. So I may not have liked this film very much, but the acting (mainly Ejiofor) is the only reason why I would see the again. Other than that, there's no point, like the movie itself.<br/><br/>1/4"

","Saw the movie Tuesday's night was left little disappointed because of high hopes and didn't felt the main character did justice to the role in my own opinion but raw and powerful performance by Lupita playing Patsy was the life of this strong work of nonfiction. Patsy became the symbol of injustice of laws made by men. A society driven by power and greed.<br/><br/>What can i say the movie reinforced the very real view i have about cruelty and horrors humans are capable of. Generally we live our life ignorant of others people suffering and feelings and act blindly in our own selfish interests. Religions are distorted and customs developed for the powerful to remain in Power and subjugate the weak.<br/><br/>12 years a slave portrays a graphic picture of the mindset of the slaves which was intentionally created so as that they were left paralyzed by fear and beliefs which were instilled by using religion as a tool.<br/><br/>One scene of particular importance where the main character is near death hanging by neck and other slaves doing routine work and children playing nearby showed very true picture of apathy."
"naiha-raza","3","3","6","31 March 2014"," um, no
","Maybe it was because I heard so many good things about it that I was expecting too much out of this film. To be fair however as I stopped half way through the film (it lacked any emotional 'hook') so I'll just speak about the parts I did see.<br/><br/>Acting was terrible. and I'm not talking about the lead characters here, but the smaller roles. For instance the scene where Solomon is beaten with a wooden bat for the first time. I think the director was trying to get some shock value out of the scene, but frankly, the aggressor seemed to be over doing it. Scenes like these repeated monotonously over the next hour or so that I watched before I finally quit. <br/><br/>I think this movie was some sort of an American apology to the black community. Sit for two hours and curse your ancestors for what they did and then move on in life. I wonder why no one makes a movie on the horrors of racism people face today?"
"VhaugnndeixU","3","3","6","25 March 2014"," Such A Story Of Substance, But Not In This Movie.
","For a story with such substance, this movie is quite shallow. The first time we see Solomon, he's already enslaved. He has three {or four?} inconsequential flashbacks to his freedom, his family, whom we don't even get to know, and his violin playing, and that's it. They're there to give us facts, that's it. No relationship with him is formed, and the abduction comes out of no where, leaving us at a loss of a reason to really care about him. We care because he's a slave, but he's not going through anything any of the others aren't, so what sets him apart? What makes him our hero? He's not. The dialogue and setup of the scenes were stilted and overly dramatic emotional bombardments of points, not a nuanced unfolding that we can settle into and care about. You are not immersed, but instead simply watching. And cringing.<br/><br/>Such as the language. Now granted, that is the way people talked back then, all perfect grammar and formal wording and stiff. But I'm sure you would not speak perfect and formal in every situation, especially very stressful ones. Throughout there was a stiffness and, dare I say, a falseness to what you're watching for that reason. It wasn't relaxed. When Solomon is talking to whatshername, the crying mother slave who was once free like him, the dialogue was pissing me off. It was acted too stageplay-ish and see through. I saw that scene online before in the movie, and hoped the whole movie was not like that, but given today's film making, I was a fool to. It was. Sometimes over acting in that way is good for a movie like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" or ""Inherit The Wind,"" but here it took you out of the scene. Slaves did not speak like that, even if they were once free like Solomon was, tone it the hell down. <br/><br/>The whites were all the same. Viscous, mean and not normal. Nothing slows down. At least until Brad Pitt, of course.<br/><br/>Then there are details that were greatly needed, like what did his family do when he was gone? Did they investigate? Did others look for him? Did they encounter other families who were going through the same thing? And when Solomon finally has a way {after 12 years?} of getting a letter, a letter, mind you, to a friend in New York, via white, zombie slaying savior Brad Pitt, what were the goings on of that? How did it happen? How long? We are not given a full scale picture of what was a very large scale real event. It's choppy and narrow. Solomon became active in freeing slaves but we are only told that through writing on the screen after the end. <br/><br/>Lastly the meeting up again with his family was truly weird. He is taken to a house where they {his wife, kids, son in law and new grandson} are standing. Standing. When he enters there is no bum rush into each other. No shouts of I love you or thank God you're home or we missed you so much. No crying and going crazy as normal people would. Instead they just stand there before him like he's a stranger. He tells them to ""Forgive"" his appearance {gray hair}. After his daughter introduces her husband and newborn to him, his bitch of a wife finally decides it might be good time to approach him now. He says forgive me, which was heartbreaking. She says ""there's nothing to forgive"" which was true, but you gotta see the scene to believe it. There's no way that really happened like that.<br/><br/>Also it got creepy when for one minute and a half Solomon looks at the scenery around him and then stares into he camera, at us. In the eye. I looked away and wanted it to stop. The violence didn't give me that reaction. This is unbelievable poor storytelling and not even the brief shot of naked man wang can save it. The directing, lighting, acting {aside from the content}, costumes and sets, landscape, music, and atmosphere are all spot on and great to look at. Now only if the narrative could be overhauled to match. It had the same air as other black films like ""The Butler"" and ""Precious,"" constant point making with nothing else to grasp."

","I am going to be short and sweet with this review and say that this movie is absolutely awful. I decided to watch this movie because of all the hype and attention that was brought upon this movie. Unfortunately, what I got was poor plot, little character development, and scenes that made you want to leave the room. Let's be honest; it is not necessary to incorporate a 5 minute scene of Ejiofor staring into the distance. It is absolutely 100% boring and left me appalled on how this won best picture. The only reason why I gave this film a 3 was because of the superb acting by Lupita Nyong'o who gave the movie a small dose of hope, but it didn't last very long. Ultimately, I will never watch this movie ever again and I am utterly shocked that this won best picture. Movies like Captain Phillips and Dallas Buyers Club should have earned more recognition for their accomplishments, not this."

","I should start by saying I enjoy slow-paced dramas. But I don't remember myself being bored in a movie that much before, everything 12 Years a Slave tries to do is to disgust you from slavery, it's more of an educational movie.<br/><br/>The thing that really disturbed me was they were really forcing you to feel bad; which caused the movie having almost no script at all. You just sit and watch the torment to slaves. <br/><br/>I believe the only reason why this movie won the Best Picture award is because it is bashing racism with it's all strength. It's a good educational production but as a movie, it's quite weak. It's nowhere near movies like The Wolf of Wall Street, Dallas Buyers Club and Her."
"marcin_kukuczka","9","3","6","9 March 2014"," Provocative, Daring, Absorbing Achievement
","""The man who has no inner-life is a slave to his surroundings"" (Henri Frederic Amiel).<br/><br/>The above quotation may seem to miss the point of the movie's content and yet, in the long run, you may see striking parallels among various 'incarnations' of slavery. But, there is no philosophy whatsoever...rather something utterly down to earth. What can touch viewers more profoundly, what may appear more appealing than real memoirs written in lifetime with human hand, carved in the stone of human experience? That is the story of Solomon Northup enriched with an unbelievably austere form this movie takes.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why Steve McQueen's film has been labeled as a 'long awaited' production and considered to be a ""pioneering drama about American slaves"" (Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian) is its emotional resonance. Both film scholars and contemporary film freaks will agree that the supreme subject matter of the movie is not so much how evil the INSTITUTION of slavery was but rather how evil a human can be to another human - this in-depth insight into inner drives that prompt to evoke the best or the worst out of a person. If many producers usually fall into awing viewers with effects, 12 YEARS AS A SLAVE proves to succeed in provocative, daring and absorbing address of the conflicts within human being in his inner world and outside world. With him primarily comes a historical period that is rather supplied with thought provoking questions (sometimes rhetorical, yes) than strengthened by some 'intellectual depiction.'<br/><br/>Keeping that in mind, one could echo the words of Paul MacInnes from the Guardian that the movie ""confronts a practice that endured in the United States of America for nearly 250 years."" In that social/political dimension, Peter Bradlaw memorably points out that it is ""a story from the cold civil war that preceded the hot one."" But it is above all the protagonist that makes it a wholly absorbing drama.<br/><br/>The memoirs by Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) are skillfully adapted by the novelist John Ridley. Mind you, 'AS A SLAVE' in the title indicates a role imposed on him rather than something that would reveal who he really was deep down. He had to live AS A SLAVE though he was actually never a slave innately. That may echo the quotation I entailed at the beginning, that may evoke the very truth about the inner vs. the outer reality of a human being who dares not be afraid of such confrontation. Therefore, the major strength of McQueen's movie lies in the fact that it is, above all, a simple and touching story of a particular man with his tragedy, his humiliation, his suffering.<br/><br/>Thanks to Chiwetel Ejiofor, we have a truly powerful depiction of this drama, a wondrous insight into thought provoking feelings and emotions that may rise in a free man turned into a slave. The protagonist, a talented violinist who had a family in New York and used to live a life of a free man has to confront the reality that he had barely foreseen in nightmares. There are many scenes that, mind you, are not very wordy but where images say more than words could do. That is a wonderful return to the cinema's primordial power - to touch viewers through what they see. Even in these hardest conditions, he appears not to lose his hope...as long as all is brought to a truly touching conclusion that, in a way, becomes an almost reference to the biblical reunion of Joseph and his family. Forget the bitter past for the sun still illumines our future.<br/><br/>Within the artistic concept, kudos to cinematographer Sean Bobbit and his interesting uses of images. We can experience some moments of the atmosphere of the Old South, not praised as, for instance, in GONE WITH THE WIND where the charm of southern belles and manners of slave owners seem to dominate and shadow the tragedy of the humiliated ones. The shots of nature, the picking of cotton provide a specific image for the whole story and place the viewers in a realistic locations. The movie boast truly beautiful photography. <br/><br/>Among the supporting cast, a mention must be made of Lupita Nyong'o as Patsy. Her role is, perhaps, the one that we will most identify with and empathize with apart from the protagonist. She said in an interview that ""being part of 12 YEARS AS A SLAVE has been one of the most powerful experiences of my life."" That says for itself. The scene she is being whipped by Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) is particularly disturbing and yet dramatic and intense. Something that leaves you sort of speechless. Also, credit to Mr Fassbender for portraying the cruel, almost lunatic-maniac slave master and Brad Pitt whom you will never forget in the little yet immensely important role of carpenter Bass.<br/><br/>When emotions after the Oscar night have calmed down, 12 YEARS AS A SLAVE will remain as a provocative, daring, absorbing movie about a man who had his inner life which helped him stay alive and meet his beloved ones as an experienced 'master' of will to survive and dare face 'a tomorrow of dignity.'"

"peterp-450-298716","8","3","6","3 March 2014"," A film that continues to resonate
","My sentimentality stretches the length of a coin.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" is an impressive adaptation of the diary of Solomon Northup,a free man who lived in Washington with his family in 1840. He's approached by two businessmen who offer him a lucrative job in a circus as a musician.Solomon is drugged and abducted to the Southern states of America to be sold there as a slave.What follows is a gripping and horrific tale of a man who tries to survive in inhuman conditions and suffers under the authority of the white plantation owners who rule with a severe hand and who judge over the fate of these Afro-Americans.<br/><br/>At times it's painful and unbearable to watch certain images.The helplessness on the faces and the hopeless situation of these people was distressing to see.The moment they arrive in New Orleans there is that momentary image of chained blacks with amputated hands and an apathetic resigned expression on their face. These Afro-Americans were seen purely as goods:assessed as an ordinary horse and if they no longer meet the requirements,they were simply removed.The whole movie is a picture of humiliation,abuse and torture.The feeling of disgust was never far away.<br/><br/>The settings and decoration of the entire film was stunning.The whole movie breathed the spirit of that time, both in Washington and in the southern states.Washington looked like a prosperous sophisticated city.The southern part looked sultry and dusty. You could feel the oppressive heat blasting of the screen and you could almost smell the sweat (by fear and efforts).Beautiful outdoor shots and impressions alternated with shabby huts and decay .<br/><br/>An impressive cast has also been incorporated.I must admit that I had never heard of Chiwetel Ejiofor.Till now he had the status of ""that-guy-who-also-plays-in-that-movie"".That will change now I guess and his (difficult) name will now sound more familiar.However, he also starred in "" Salt "" and ""American Gangster"" to my surprise.In this movie he plays the role of his life and it's well worth an Oscar nomination. It's sublime to see how he brings the metamorphosis of an articulate and accepted person into a humiliated and silence imposed slave. A variety of facial expressions pass by: enjoying first, then desperate, humiliated and submissive, anger and resentment, sense of justice and compassionate, and then relieved and remorseful. The whole pallet he apparently plays effortlessly. Michael Fassbender is far better in this movie as the cruel, despotic and demonic Edwynn Epps, than when he played the counselor in ""The counselor"".At this time he is number one on my list of most sadistic and disgusting movie characters.A figure who adores his dominance, uses a young girl for his personal enjoyment to the annoyance of his wife and apparently has a drinking problem causing unpredictable and dangerous mood swings .The unknown Lupita Nyong'o can look back on a matchless performance and is clearly launched in Hollywood land . What a wonderful achievement! Cumberbatch his contribution was unfortunately limited. At times the figure Ford came across as an affable man who could muster some compassion. But ultimately they were for him purely an investment, not more than that. The moment Solomon arrives at Ford's estate together with a bereaved mother, who was painfully separated from her children, Ford's wife showed a perfect display of the attitude in those parts at that time. First she is compassionate and concerned. Subsequently she advices a necessary hearty meal for the woman and says that she'll forget about her children after a few days. This sad woman is also removed afterwards because she'd likely affect morale. There are also short performances (but not the least) by Paul Giamatti as the shrewd slave trader , Paul Dano as the cruel Tibeats (recently he played a brilliant part in ""Prisoners""),Sarah Paulson as the wife of Epps (Mary Lee in ""Mud"") and Brad Pitt. The latter had a substantive and crucial role in this movie. He's finally the one who ultimately gave Solomon his freedom back. Whether Pitt had to play it or not is another question. It could have been anyone else in my opinion, but his name will probably ensure extra attention, I suppose.<br/><br/>So it's a compelling and poignant movie about one of the blackest pages in American history. The strongest point was the lengthy scene where Solomon dangles on a string and in the background everyone slowly goes back to what he or she was doing, as if nothing is happening. The fact that other slaves aren't conversing that much, makes complete sense. The lesson was to say as little as possible, let alone that it would come out that you can read and write. As someone also warned ""Unless you want to be a dead negro."".<br/><br/>And yet this film is not one that stands above everything else. Notwithstanding that this period may never be forgotten, at the end I had a ""Here we go again"" feeling. It's not that long ago we saw "" Django Unchained"",""The Butler"" and ""Lincoln"". Plus the fact that there were television series shown in the past like ""Roots"" and ""North and South"".I hope that we can let this topic rest for a while now. I also found it strange that although Solomon demonstrates intelligence and seems to be a wise and eloquent man, apparently it wasn't a reason to start worrying. If I were a landowner I would get rid of him as soon as possible. Also the fact that despite the trials Solomon stayed calm at all times (until the reunion with his family), seemed a little excessive to me . And in addition, the film title itself tells the complete story. You can't be surprised anymore or enjoy some ingenious found twist.<br/><br/>A film that continues to resonate, a magnificent achievement in acting and for me an Oscar for Chiwetel Ejiofor . However, the movie itself is yet another one in a long row of the same.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"
"pcrprimer","9","3","6","1 March 2014"," Powerful film that is tough to watch, but needs to be seen
","This is truly a movie that I doubt anybody could watch more than once. The entire cast shines in this movie, with Fassbender delivering a bone- chilling performance as the cruel slavemaster. Although 2 hours and 15 minutes long, it feels much longer due to the bleak outlook of the main character. Every member of the cast delivers a stellar performance in this cast, with particular mention to Paul Dano who has shown once again how far he has come from the Girl Next Door days. I also appreciated that they added the character of Benedict Cumberbatch to show that there were certain people at that time that were not completely against slavery nor cruel as Fassbender's or Giamatti's character. It was important to show that these kind of people existed at the time, and acted as enablers of slavery, without actually demonizing them. Steve McQueen, also does a great job using the cast and creating some great shots with excellent cinematography. One of the shots that stands out is after Solomon has been kidnapped and how the camera simply focuses the dark, deep whirring of the propeller of the steamboat. I found it almost similar to how a certain, sometimes mundane detail is focused upon in terrible nightmares. One minor nitpick would be the presence of Brad Pitt. In spite of his important role as producer, I feel that another actor should have been given his role. It seems way too perfect to give the A-list star the role of the only moral character in the whole movie."
"HumphreyGo-Kart","5","3","6","13 February 2014"," A film which felt 12 years long
","Steve McQueen's '12 Years as a Slave' is a poorly executed exploitation of a classic story, lacking an underlying sense of meaning. It had great potential as an adaption of Solomon Northup's eponymous memoir, yet poor directorial decisions hindered it from leaving a lasting impact of colonial-era American slavery in my mind.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen (no, the other one) has previously achieved artistic and critical acclaim for his previous two works, Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011). '12 Years a Slave' follows a similar model to the former titles - touchy, depressing subjects, whose nature are paralleled with reading Russian literature and listening to Leonard Cohen in a cold, dark abbey.<br/><br/>Consequently, the permutation of this with a great cast (and accompanying great acting), relatively unexplored setting and great cinematography (with the excellent use of pauses) seems to scream 'modern classic' to be.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the poor character development and abrupt ending undermine this movie from becoming something truly great.<br/><br/>The reluctant slave masters, respectively played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt, aim to represent angst and disillusionment with slavery, yet their true ethical positions aren't really established throughout their screen time.<br/><br/>This film, though its intentions are legitimate and original, misses the point; McQueen relies too heavily on special effects and confronting sexual scenes (some without explanation) to compensate for an underdeveloped storyline (hardly the first offender in recent film history).<br/><br/>While a mediocre title, I look forward to McQueen's next picture and hope the commercial success of this film proliferates the status of Chiwetel Ejiofor, an actor I adore."

","I was expecting great things of this film. ""A modern classic"", everyone said. ""Oscar-worthy emotional drama with excellent acting"" they said. The list of Oscar nominations it received along with the general public consensus led me to believe I was about to watch one of the seminal films of modern cinema... <br/><br/>That only compounded the disappointment, and dismay that confronted me during and after the film.<br/><br/>The subject matter should make for an interesting and deeply emotional story. And it could have... if not for some frankly weird direction. The pace seemed too slow, and there didn't seem to be a clear narrative to the story. There were no particular defined story-lines that had a clear direction, instead the story just kind of 'meandered along' - just telling the tale of stuff that happened to a bloke in times of slavery.<br/><br/>This to me reeks of a Director either in above his head, or just plain not knowing what he is doing or what kind of film he is trying to make.<br/><br/>Some of the cinematography was poor too, the pacing issue I already mentioned was painfully obvious during long scenes of character's faces (that seemed disjointed, pointless to the preceding and proceeding scenes, and represented nothing at all), that were just odd, too long and largely pointless to anything.<br/><br/>Overall, a wasted opportunity I feel.

","If you haven't seen The Soloist and Django Unchained then you might enjoy this film. The title could be as easy as ''1 year a slave'' . When I was watching the film , the 12 years were not there no matter how boring were the repetitive scenes. The Plot is weak. Performance of the main character lacks in character development, equal from start till end. Instead of picking a violin not so far from a cello like in The Soloist, the character could have any other instrument, maybe jazz instruments to be more plausible and really show the afro-American important contribution to music and culture. That would add more life to the character and film. Lots of unnecessary scenes. Predictable ending. Would not see this film again."

","Slavery is indeed a heinous crime against humanity that existed in the United States in the past. I had seen this crime brought to life in numerous films from the ""Roots"" mini-series in my youth up to ""Django Unchained"" last year.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" is yet another film that brings back those sordid days of suffering indignities and torture while forced to work in those cotton fields in the American South. Truth to tell, I felt the scenes depicting these horrific events were not really different from what we have seen in the past. Maybe, the level of violence may have been amped up by available technology, but the painful message remains the same.<br/><br/>The interesting details which were new to me were those that depicted the abduction of free Northern Afro-Americans to be forced into slavery. It was also terrible to see the slave selling scenes featuring a sinister cameo by Paul Giamatti. But these happen within the first hour of the film. The rest of the film already felt squeamishly familiar, but harder to watch because the floggings approach (though thankfully not exceed) ""Passion of the Christ"" levels. <br/><br/>The acclaim and awards-buzz that precedes the performance of lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor is much-deserved. His Solomon Northup maintains his dignity even under the yoke of slavery. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender (a favorite star of director Steve McQueen) is very effective as evil incarnated as slave owner, the cruel Edwin Epps. But, sad to say, I felt he did not bring anything we have not seen before to this type of role.<br/><br/>First-time film actress Lupita Nyong'o had a heart-rending debut as Patsey, the young female slave who was the unfortunate apple of the leering eyes of Master Epps, which makes the blood of jealous Mistress Epps (a cold Sarah Paulsen) boil. <br/><br/>The technical aspect of the film were all first-rate, from the cinematography, to the production design, to the costumes, to the music. Maybe the Oscar hype around this film may have given me unrealistic expectations. It was not bad by any measure, but just not as excellent as I was expecting it to be."

","Solomon Northrup is a freeman with a wife and children, living in Saratoga, New York, in the years before the Civil War. He makes his living as a fiddler, and when he's invited to join a troupe for a gig in Washington, he agrees. In Washington, he's drugged by his partners, given a false identity, and sold down the river into slavery in Louisiana. After twelve years, he finds his way home.<br/><br/>I hate to say this but I found the movie lush but repellent. I can't imagine -- well, maybe I can -- that there are viewers who don't know what slavery in the South was like.<br/><br/>In addition, despite its being based on Northrup's memoirs, I thought the scenes of punishment, though well done, were overemphasized and sometimes unconvincing. For instance, the two men who take Northrup from Saratoga to Washington. They have dinner in an elegant Washington hotel, after which Northrup vomits in an alley and is put to bed by his companions, where he sleeps soundly until he wakes up manacled in a dungeon. I can believe his companions got Northrup drunk and sold him out, but drugged? It's a common movie device. The original ""Mickey Finn"", chloral hydrate, wasn't used as a hypnotic until 1869. Before that, there was nothing that could knock Northrup out. I wish the movie had been honest and simply shown him having a good time in the big city and overcelebrating.<br/><br/>That initial suspicion runs through the entire movie. Some of the events are eminently believable, others not. I can certainly believe the brutal beatings, rapes, destruction of families, and lynchings. But the director's camera lingers on them, far too long, long after we understand the import of the scene. You've seen lashes dealt out before, aboard sailing ships and on plantations, but you have never seen so many, nor have they lasted so long. It begins to seem as if the film intends not only to depict the brutality but to revel in it. It starts to look a little like a member of the emerging genre of torture porn.<br/><br/>I realize that criticizing a film like this isn't exactly politically correct, and yet we've seen it before, even if less lavishly displayed. It's been thirty years or more since ""Roots."" Except that here, the director has thrown in some sex -- full frontal female nudity, masturbation in the midst of misery -- just in case you find yourself bored with the atrocities. I have a similar problem with movies about the Nazi genocide. The subjects carry so much in the way of moral outrage that a simple-minded, commercial approach cheapens the tragedy.<br/><br/>The photography and wardrobe are just fine. The dialog is stilted, like ""True Grit"" with no wit. Apparently the antebellum South never heard of contractions like ""don't"" or ""won't"". ""Slavery is an evil that should not be permitted."" That's the way people wrote, in Spencerian script, not the way they spoke. The N word is used without restraint, but I give that a pass because it's evidently historically accurate.<br/><br/>I gave it an hour before I was too disgusted to go on. Yet, I think it's a valuable movie for the one in five Americans who can't name the country we achieved our independence from, according to a 2011 poll taken on the Fourth of July. Maybe they really DON'T know."

","I had to write a review about this movie when I learnt that this movie has won 'movie of the year' awards at various awards ceremony and is favourite to win at the Oscars too. I look at the past winners of the Oscars, films like 'Gladiator', 'Million dollar baby', 'Titanic' - all of which were hugely entertaining and I can't believe this may join them. <br/><br/>This movie was very boring and very long. It was depressing scene after depressing scene. This film was not entertaining and was more like a documentary film (which should have been released on TV with less famous actors, maybe at Sky history channel?) as it had none of the qualities I enjoy in a movie. I guess I knew it was going to be like this and I guess I should not have gone to see this movie. There was no entertainment at all, just boredom and portrayal of distressing and depressing scenes, one after the other.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Michael Fassbender from his 'Xmen - first class' movie and I was impressed again by his performance of an evil man who was sexually attracted to one of his female slaves. I guess I do have a bias towards him as I am a huge fan of his portrayal of Magneto in X men. All the actors do an excellent job and are very believable. <br/><br/>Slavery is a sensitive topic and this film has given an insight into what it would have been like for a slave in those days. So in terms of education and visual portrayal of slavery, this movie did an excellent job. This was an emotional movie and one cannot deny the pain and suffering that the main character and indeed slaves in general went through in our history. One moving scene at the end where he meets his family again after 12 years was particularly moving especially as he learns that his grandson which he sees for the first time is named after him - Solomon.<br/><br/>Overall I can only get a feeling that this movie is so successful in the box office and the awards ceremony as it deals with a controversial issue such as slavery. In a way people are scared of putting this movie down as not to come off as a racist or not politically correct. If you want entertainment and enjoyment, do not go to watch this movie. If you want an education lesson about mainly what one particular slave went through and witnessed during his time as a slave and want to witness depressing, disturbing and generally a boring two and half hour movie, please feel free and watch this movie."

The narration is laborious and that just emphasizes as the movie goes, the last half-hour is particularly chaotic, scenes follow one another with not much coherence.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have the dramatic dimension of the true story on which it relies on, as poignant as Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance, the only actor to stand out within a fancy but under-exploited cast.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave turns out to be a terrible disappointment in comparison with what we were expecting from a talented director."

","The best thing about 12 YEARS A SLAVE is Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup, a free man from New York who was abducted and sold into slavery... With limitless potential, the African American actor deserves this starring role. The worst thing is he's mostly stuck providing reactions to other characters ranging from beaten slaves to formidable slavers.<br/><br/>Director Steve McQueen (who should add a middle initial) might have been influenced by Spielberg's holocaust epic SCHINDLER'S LIST There is already a score of comparisons between both films. What's missing in 12 YEARS are the reasons and/or motivations for showing the atrocities other than being a true story about the infamous Antebellum South.<br/><br/>In LIST, Ralph Fiennes's Goeth commits random acts of unfathomable violence that are not only examples of Nazi rule, but cause the protagonists to counterbalance in a mental game of cat and mouse. All Northup's left to do is witness the maniacal madness of Michael Fassbender's sexually-driven plantation owner after surviving over-the-top henchman played by Paul Dano and Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>While it's ultimately moving and historically significant, and Ejiofor does have moments to rise above the increasing and unceasing torment, Solomon Northup's 12-year sentence feels more like a single prolonged scene with various actors and locations than a multi-layered biopic for the audience to get completely lost in."

","I saw ""12 Years a Slave"", starring Chiwetel Ejiofor-Salt, Serenity; Benedict Cumberbatch-Star Trek Into Darkness, War Horse; Michael Fassbender-Prometheus, Jonah Hex and Sarah Paulson-The Spirit, Serenity.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story about a free black man in the 1850's-pre Civil War-that was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Chiwetel plays the man that lives in New York with his wife and two kids. He is abducted and taken to the deep south-Georgia, I think-where Benedict buys him at a slave auction. Chiwetel tries to explain his circumstances to anyone that will listen but nobody does and he is beaten into submission. After a disagreement with one of the 'Masters', Chiwetel is sold to Michael, who is not as kind as Benedict was. Sarah plays Michael's wife and she is not nice to the slaves, either. Besides beating his slaves, one of Michael's favorite pastimes is that he likes to have sexual relations with his female slaves. Which is one of the reasons Sarah is not nice to the slaves-she knows what Michael does. Anyone familiar with that period of time knows that is was not a good time to be a black person. The punishment slaves endured was usually a whip across the back, and not just a few lashes, either-some got 50 or more. Another punishment involved throwing a rope over a tree, with one end tied around the black person's neck. Some of the torture scenes were uncomfortable to watch, but I'm sure that that was the point. The acting was good, I can see some names popping up around Oscar time, and there are a few cameo actors that show up. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental."

","""12 Years a Slave"" is an unusual story about slavery and its evils because unlike most films, this one is based on the true story of a black man who was free but was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the early-mid 19th century. Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was a happy man--with a wife and kids. However, once kidnapped, as the title suggests, he disappeared for 12 years and was treated brutally. The film shows his MANY trials--including beatings, attempted hangings and witnessing rapes and other atrocities.<br/><br/>The Oscar winners will be announced tomorrow and there is a lot of buzz for ""12 Years a Slave"" as well as ""Gravity"". I saw both in the last two days and would easily pick ""Gravity"". Now this is NOT because I think ""12 Years a Slave"" is a bad film. No, it's quite good. However, it's also a rather straight-forward narrative punctuated by many scenes of brutality--and not all that different from films such as ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"", ""Roots"" or ""Amistad"". It's all very sad but doesn't really break much new ground. Whereas the entire production of ""Gravity"" is unlike anything ever made before--and has a completely unique and breathtaking space adventure that looks and feels as if you are there. To me, this makes ""Gravity"" my pick--though both are very good films.<br/><br/>By the way, I mentioned the brutality in ""12 Years a Slave"". All of it was very appropriate to include in the film but it's simply too rough for kids. Think twice before you allow younger viewers to watch it or, better yet, watch it with them."

","And this is why I did not like Oldboy's remake in the first place. Not that 12 Years A Slave is anyway applicable as a remake, but I do not understand why a simple predictable story comes as a brilliant epitome of cinematic masterpiece to everyone.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor is marvelous as the main protagonist and chances are he may sweep the Oscar. So he is kidnapped and sold as a slave is a heart- wrenching story. His antebellum days of slavery reminded me of Django Unchained's & The Help's setup, which in turn oozed out the newness from it. I have read, watched all about the blacks-whites discrimination, but setting your story (which is a true story, for Chrissakes) and retelling it is quite mainstream.<br/><br/>Maybe the fuss is about the score, which is mind you, amazing by Hans Zimmer. Michael Fassbender is charming, as well. Steve McQueen's direction is terrific, all right. But cinematography like zooming into people's noses just won;t catch my fancy. The 2 hours was never boring and thus, a humble 6.1/10. And it was quite emotional to feel the characters' pain. A fine work, anyway.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Term it a masterpiece? No. That won't come from me. It may sweep few Oscars for the costume, the setup, the performances, but as a film, it does not ring a bell in my critical point of view.

"akash_sebastian","8","3","7","15 January 2014"," Most Realistic Depiction of Slavery I've Seen on Screen
","Artist-turned-Director Steve McQueen always comes up with such intriguing and unique stories/movies with vast psychological and emotional depth. Like his previous two brilliant works, 'Hunger' and 'Shame', '12 Years a Slave' is relatable at so many human levels.<br/><br/>When you talk about slavery, you can ask how can it be relevant or relatable to all of us? The principal story of the movie is about a free black man who is tricked and sold into slavery, and suddenly loses his freedom in his early 30's. The movie clearly portrays Slavery as the loss of Freedom in which people are bullied and tortured to work for their masters; that speaks to everyone at some level or the other. This bold and powerful cinematic piece by McQueen is, by far, the most brutally real and gripping portrayal of the Slavery I've seen on screen; it doesn't celebrate the torture or bloodshed, and it doesn't talk about revenge - it just depicts things as they were. For many of the scenes, the camera non-judgmentally lingers around the characters; it almost makes you feel guilty that you're there, but there lies the beauty of the movie.<br/><br/>British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor started his film career over 15 years ago, and has been 'that guy' actor for a while. We've seen him around in many significant not-so-lengthy roles in many good films, but this is the film which will finally push people to learn his name properly. He has given an impeccable performance, and the talent with which he delves into the emotional depth of the character (Solomon Northup) helps you picture the situations through his eyes. McQueen regular Michael Fassbender skilfully transforms himself as the despicable and arrogant slaver Edwin Epps, and is almost unrecognizable in his new villainous role. Sarah Paulson is terrific as the proud, obnoxious and jealous wife of Edwin Epps, and is more discriminate and cruel than her husband, which is quite unusual for female characters in historic movies. As expected, supporting actors like Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Brad Pitt and Paul Giamatti perform their parts quite ably. But it's debutant Lupita Nyong'o, playing the part of tortured and sexually-abused slave Patsey, who's the star of the movie and almost outshines everyone else. The movie revolves around lead character Solomon, but towards the second half, it's the agony, misery and anger of Patsey that drives the story forward. And the flair with which Miss Nyong'o portrays these emotions is really commendable. In my opinion, she's the emotional epicenter of the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Sean Bobbitt is remarkable. Hans Zimmer's background score surely goes well with the characters' emotions, but the resemblance it bears with 'Time' from Inception (his previous work) proves to be a big distraction. Score resemblances to other great movies diminishes the impact of the scene to a certain extent (because the mind already associates it with something else). This is the only complain I had with the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a brilliantly portrayed journey of survival and redemption. ""Slavery is an evil that should befall none."""
"rigo-armienta","10","3","7","16 December 2013"," Masterpiece with an underrated performance by Lupita Nyong'o
","It took me a few minutes while the credits were rolling to muster the strength to physically stand up and walk out of the theater. This film completely floored me. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've seen many, many good movies. Everybody was superb. McQueen's use of simple silence in this movie is so powerful. Chiwetel Ejiofor was so heart breaking in his performance. I felt so much compassion for the man that I had to remind myself it was just a movie. Michael Fassbender was completely ruthless and fascinating to watch unravel, and Benedict Cumberbatch's short (unfortunately) spell in this movie was among my favorite aspects of the film.<br/><br/>However, one name that hasn't received nearly enough recognition is Lupita Nyongo'o. She played poor Patsy on Fassbender's plantation. There's a very prominent scene that I won't spoil, but it involves gruesome images of slave life in the 1800's. Her portrayal of Patsy was so emotional and traumatizing that you have no choice but to cry with her. She moves you. And that ending! Oh my God! Go see it. Now. Before the Oscars. I'm finding it very difficult for anyone to challenge Chiwetel Ejiofor for best actor this year."

","Emphasizing the fact that freedom is priceless, the film ""12 Years a Slave"", which has Academy Award nominations in 9 categories, shows the different forms of the war between white men and black men lasting for centuries conspicuously. Steve McQueen, acclaimed director of successful movies like ""Shame"" and ""Hunger"", amplifies the power of the reality and vitality of the story by rendering his own feelings in. We should discuss this in detail. According to the movie and the proletarian dictatorship, the injustice and slaughter that enslaved black man subjected is a great crime. We can see that ownership instinct and hierarchical system have nothing to do with belief systems; the only reason is the ""poisonous ego"" of the humankind. Just like we see in the movie, ""12 Years a Slave"". <br/><br/>Solomon Northup is an African American guy, who lives in New York with his family and devoted himself to music. Solomon is a happy man with his freedom of choice. One day, he meets two men about a music job and goes to Washington to work as a musician. But the civilized world that he believed in turns upside down; those two men drugs and kidnaps him and sell to plantation in the South as a slave. The only thing, we can tell about the rest of the movie is that your tears will flow. Because all a slave's psychology subjected is suffering, torture and slaughter. The beatings Solomon and the other slaves received are the reflections of cruelty. This heart-breaking situation may remind the audience of the Hitler's, Stalin's and Franco's dictatorships. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that the center of this story of slavery war and personal freedom that happened 200 years ago, is the protagonist Solomon, who was ossified with his ups and downs, fears, endurance and dedication to life, while he also defies it. Maybe this sorrowful journey of Solomon, who is a unique personality, is a bitter pill to swallow, but he reflects his inner light on everything that has happened and this constitutes the backbone of this story's naivety. The despair and unrecoverable anger, our protagonist feels, show the faith of the character drifted towards obscurity. We can identify this as the established form of pain and sorrow. Taking main character away from his homeland and beaming him to an unfamiliar place, a center of evil is throwing audience a curve. From this point, we can draw an analogy of Solomon like this: While the dark clouds cast their shadows over his life persistently, just like Rodin's famous sculpture ""The Thinker"", he loses himself far away in his loneliness. No matter how depressing this scene is, having a strong character, Solomon doesn't give up and learns how to fight with his loneliness, come what may. In addition to this, beyond the struggle for life and the destructive psychological situation, he almost becomes the projection of a troubled life, with an attitude like he can control everything easily. The oppression created by this clash of clans and cruelty increases in daily basis and the unpredictable end that leads to worries us. As we are over- sensitive to this subject, the film made us cry, rarely got our hopes up, reminded us that above all we're human beings and thrown us into the hands of indescribable sorrow. <br/><br/>Frankly speaking, along with this kind of hurtful laws of the civilization, the effort of those remorseless people trying to cover their shameful activities as if nothing has happened, presents the essence of the story, which runs towards an inevitable ending. This remorselessness emerges to the surface once in some people, a few times in some and frequently in some and becomes the identity of them. Then, there's nothing you can do about that kind of individuals. Though, there is a saying as ""there is no end to the cures within democracies"", but it's hard to talk about the existence of a democracy within this example. The best example of this is the antagonist Edwin's (Michael Fassbender) usage of slaves as his own assets. The words coming from the optimist Canadian farmer (Brad Pitt), who always sees the glass half full, are: ""Everybody is equal before the laws, whether he is black or white. If you have been in their shoes just for one day, you would never act like this again."" Emphasizing the importance of being empathetic with these words, Canadian, who has his heart in the right place, also underlines the need of the slaves to walk from darkness into the light. In fact, the reason why ""they bide, they're on their feet"" saying is attributed to slaves is that they never give up. Just a small light of hope would show everyone the meaning and importance of their determination towards life.<br/><br/>Now, imagine that all these events of the story are backed with the music of a great composer like Hans Zimmer. Wouldn't be so motivational? Yes, you didn't hear wrong; the music of the movie is composed by Hans Zimmer. It's a clever move for director McQueen to combine Hans Zimmer's magnificent music with his 2:35:1 CinemaScope images. As if all these brought the movie to a fourth dimension. Gluing the audience on their seats with his high quality cinematography, McQueen gives a lesson on what to shoot and how, by using all visual elements in their proper place, especially the objects that enters the frame. He fits the vivid colors, he prefers to use, via the natural spaces. By this way, the gaps within the script are also filled. But, it looks like filling the gaps was not enough to cover all the errors. For example, one of the most problematic errors that will annoy the audience is the length of the sequences. <br/><br/>As a conclusion: ""12 Years A Slave"" is a fabulous film which wrenches our hearts, fills our eyes with tears, makes us think, gives a lot of messages and serves a purpose."

It nearly brought me to tears how these individuals were so mistreated just for there colour of skin. It took me some time to get out of that zone after watching the movie because I felt so emotional and disturbed. With these things in mind, it's mainly due to the director and his extremely deep vision that could have made a movie touch so many hearts, and the excellent performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor who must have found it difficult to play such a role. All of the actors put in real performances which made the movie believable and heart warming. You do have to be in the right mood to watch this film because the whole mood is extremely deep and, in some ways, shocking. Anyway, I'm so glad that it won the academy award because it definitely deserved it.

"knguyen87","8","2","4","10 April 2014"," Solomon is a Solo Man
","With a shimmer of hope in his eyes Solomon Northup stated, ""I don't want to survive. I want to live."" (McQueen, 2013) 12 Years a Slave is based on a true story from the adaptation of Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir Twelve Years a Slave. Solomon Northup, a skilled violinist and carpenter, was a free born African-American man who was born in New York. However, he was abducted and sold as a slave in Washington, D.C. For 12 years he served for various masters throughout Louisiana. <br/><br/>From the literary aspect of the story line, I believe it was excellent. There have been various movies based off the slavery of the 18th century. Therefore, making another film about it would require the difficult task of making it stand out from the rest. However, 12 years a Slave did a fantastic job in making a name for itself. This film showed another perspective of slavery since Northup was a free African-American who was sold into slavery. The characters in the portrayal of this film were plausible, especially the main actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor, who played Solomon Northup. As a viewer, I felt his anguish when Northup was captured and taken from his family. Looking at the dialogue used in the film, which would be strange for modern day conversation, it was appropriate for the time setting. In the 18th century people spoke more properly. Looking at the major characters throughout the film, none of them showed and change. The masters continued to act like masters. Northup continued to be righteous. He went so far that he argued with one of his masters, which was an incident that almost got him lynched. Overall, the story captured my interest from the beginning until the end. I watched Northup when was a free man, when he was living as a slave, and when he was free once again. <br/><br/>The dramatic aspect of the film was well received. The majority of the actors did a great job at playing their part. However, there were was some acting that I would question. For example, Bass, who was played by Brad Pitt, picked up an English accent which I felt was not reasonable. The location and setting of the film was interesting since it is different from how it is nowadays. In the 18th Century there were more plantations than buildings. The actors wore costumes to fit in with that era. I believe 12 Years a Slave did a great job in portraying the characters and brought them to life while utilizing minimal movie stars. Brad Pitt was the sole blockbuster movie star of the film.<br/><br/>Camera angles, composition, lighting, music, and sound effects can make or break a film. I did not notice any flaw in the cinematography of 12 Years a Slave. I did notice, however, that the camera angle was usually taken from the side. There were not many scenes that were directly in front of the actors. I believe shooting the film in this manner gave it a darker and more dramatic feel. The movie portrays slavery, which is not a light topic, so it puts the viewers in a position where it is as if they are standing there with the actors. My favorite sound effect in the film was the threatening sound of a cracking whip. For example when Northup was being whipped for claiming he was not a slave. I also did not notice the use of music until the ending when the credits began showing.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I could change anything about the film, then I would allow for the development of other characters in the film. The film is based on the memoirs of Solomon Northup so naturally it would revolve around his character and his development. The film did not talk much about any of the other characters. I would have liked to see the development of a couple more characters. This would allow the viewers to get a better idea of how Northup's situation compared to the rest of the slaves or free men around him. For example, Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o, first appeared half way through the film. All we know about her is that her master molested her and at the end of the movie Northup gave her a glance before walking away. I am sure that many wondered what happened to her and would have liked to see her character develop a little more throughout the film."
"MassDistraction","7","2","4","25 February 2014"," Solid performances mostly help overcome film's shortcomings
","It's impossible not to approach a movie like 12 Years a Slave without a sense of obligation. You know you're going to experience moments that make you feel uncomfortable and face things that are downright ugly. Steve McQueen doesn't do much to cushion the blow, but he does offer a hand to lead you through this real-life horror story. That hand belongs to Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped into slavery.<br/><br/>The movie relies on Ejiofor quite heavily throughout. He's given ample time to think about his situation or, at times, the consequences of his actions. One particular scene near the end, where Solomon wonders whether he dare allow himself any hope or prepare himself for another thrashing (or worse) instead, is a master class in nuance (helped along by some well-placed thunder). He brings a humanity to his character that's more than just pity. His eyes capture a spirit and a longing. He holds the piece together. Of course, he's not the only one that shows up with their work boots on. Lupita Nyong'o delivers a stirring turn with two standout scenes, Michael Fassbender gives an understated performance of an outrageous and over-the-top character, and Sarah Paulson channels pure evil.<br/><br/>These performance go a long way to make up for some weaknesses in the script. Filled with one-note characters and some clumsy dialogue, screenwriter John Ridley gives his actors as much to overcome as to chew on. While there are some masterful sequences, like the prolonged hanging scene and Solomon's rescue, the film throws you some duds as well. Eliza and Solomon's heated exchange comes off flat as Adepero Oduye proves incapable of pulling off the questionable dialogue (""You luxuriate in his favour""). At another point, he has Solomon afraid to share his story to a potentially kind master for fear of the repercussions he might face if he's wrong about the man, but soon after has him stand up to and whip a verbally abusive overseer knowing full well there could be potentially deadly consequences. Towards the end, Brad Pitt's character comes in just in time to review some of the main themes of the film in the form of a debate and then save the day.<br/><br/>The direction here is strong, for the most part. There's no question McQueen gets everything out of his actors and he does a wonderful job of staging his scenes. If fact, most scenes, taken as individual pieces, are marvelously executed. Certainly each time Solomon's awoken in the middle of the night is powerful in its own way. But not everything adds up as a whole. He builds a mystery around the circumstances surrounding Solomon's abduction by being purposefully obfuscating and then doesn't pay it off until the film's text-based epilogue. Also, for a film named after a passage of time, the film does little to give the viewer a sense of time passing. Were it not for the specific timeframe in the film's title, one would have no idea if a decade had passed or merely a couple of years. The only evidence being the expression on Ejiofor's face and some whisps of grey hair.<br/><br/>But at other times you feel a skilled hand at the wheel. To further the theme of alienation, Solomon is rarely seen interacting with his fellow slaves after the boat trips when he's split from his initial cohorts. There's a distance between him and the other slaves. He only ever speaks to Eliza, Patsy or Mistress Shaw (about Patsy). However, during the funeral for Uncle Abram (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Dwight Henry), the group begins to sing Roll Jordan Roll. Solomon, at first, refrains from joining in. He's shown contemplating his situation. He resists but eventually seems to accept that, whatever he is, he's one of these people and surrenders to the song. It's a scene that's as overwhelming for the audience as it is for the character.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave features the efforts of some abundantly talented people and works hard to overcome its shortcomings. It stumbles along the way but manages to cross the line with dignity. If it's considered a classic in the years to come it will be in no small part to Mr. Ejiofor and his supporting cast. At least films like this and Lincoln will make history classes more interesting for coming generations."

","Having seen the trailers and so on for the film, I had hopes that this films wouldn't just be ""one of those films"" wheeled out before the Oscars that aims just to rake in the awards on what is essentially the sympathy 'X-Factor' vote. I will fully admit that I went in feeling that may have been the case for the film so it may well have coloured my opinion of it. However, I felt the film lacked emotion and any real particular connection to any of the characters, and none of them felt all that well developed beyond the idea that all the white people were heartless (save for a few) and all the slaves were angels. A small amount of research reveals that Benedict Cumberbatch's character was in fact as good as a man could be when a slave trader in those times, and was wholly driven by the times and the way things were, but this was not entirely felt in the film. Another major criticism is that there is never really any sense of how much time has passed, and the only time any real ageing looks to have taken place on Soloman being a few grey hairs near the end. In addition, his character, though understandably in that situation, distances himself from his children, by encouraging another character to stop crying over her lost children in order to stop annoying him, and having no answer to her asking if he thought of his own children. This only served to make you feel even less for a character who was poorly developed in the film. <br/><br/>There were a few great points of the film, with Michael Fassbender's performance being a true highlight as a cruel owner, but one who took interest in one of his slaves, portrayed by Lupita Nyong'o another true highlight of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I found the film to be very disappointing. The thing that truly highlights the films lack of any real emotion for me, is that my girlfriend, who I saw the film with, and who will cry at any real emotional moment in a film, (Films including Lone Survivor, Star Trek Into Darkness, Billy Elliot, Gravity and many others have seen tears smearing her make up at numerous points) remained unmoved throughout the whole film, which, considering the subject matter isn't exactly an easy feat."

Put yourself through this movie. After a while it will get through to you. Performances are great, great directing and picture. It deserves its rating."

","It was an incredible watch and It showed what life was like as a slave and it showed all the cruel punishments in detail. At times it was hard to watch when people were getting whipped. Towards the end when Patsey was getting whipped I genuinely couldn't watch it looked massively painful. The ending was also incredibly heart warming. It's absolutely crazy to me that this is a true story."

","Kinda short in story though, and a whole plot dedicated to showing how brutal the conditions of black slaves in 19th century are is not quite my cup of tea. There are more films out there that are more beloved, which I full heartedly enjoy. This is quite a hard film to sit through, but it is a must-see, and after viewing it in its whole length I can say it's one of the most well made films of the decade. From 9/10 to 8/10."

","12 years a slave first of all humanity, emotional and sadness in every aspect of the movie, its based on a true story, the life of solomon northup, the movie had a oldy atmosphere, the story was told on point it was told the way how it was in real, good job they made a biography of solomon northup, the story told us what Solomon went through because of slavery, under all circumstances he just survived, well human is not a toy to be played by others, thats what slavery does to others, imagine how people were before differentiating between colors, just because they are black or whatever that doesnt make them to live by others order, well we saw how slavery was before how people lived under orders of others how laws were before, gladly it has changed by now, well the main character wasnt there with his heart really he didnt feel that he was away from his family, he just acted as a slave he kinda wasnt fighting for his freedom, the dialogues werent that good i didnt feel powerful, i didnt feel energetic for what were they saying, i didnt feel their souls burning, but they showed us what was happening, the movie was slow burning wasnt bored from it but it felt long, at the ending were solomon returns to his family i dont feel any big or surprised impressions from others it lacked really, like after 12 years being away from others why wont the other characters cry, why they dont feel whats happening, and it showed us that this things happened in 12 years i felt it was like 12 days, we didnt notice any aging from Solomon, at last i wont recommend it to anyone unless your a hardcore movie watcher and want to discover about histories or biographies, btw this was my first slavery movie, i kinda discovered more what happened, though the movie was good but too many postive views on it from every side, a good adaptation of the story, NO TO SLAVERY, 7/10⭐"
"gavinp9","7","0","0","2 January 2018"," Some great acting and a harrowing tale, with a very touching finale, but something doesn't quite click, leaving you feeling a little numb after
","First up, a few warnings: this is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of graphic torture and despicable things which the camera does not shy away from. This is obviously to hit home the ugly truth of the reality of slavery and America's sorry past, but it's very unpleasant to watch. It's also quite slow and long - 2 hours 15min.<br/><br/>It could've used more of the support cast, since Giamatti, Dano, Cumberbatch and Pitt do a good job, but it's a true story, so there's only so much creative liberty they could've taken. Most of the film just makes you sad, angry and anguished for Solomon (Ejiofor), wishing you could do something or he and the other slaves would rebel, but that was their reality and it's a harsh pill to swallow.<br/><br/>There's no humour or light-hearted moments to lighten the mood - and arguably there shouldn't be - but it's definitely no 'Django Unchained' when you compare their entertainingness. That's not really the directors fault, but I feel it could have been paced a little better - and there seemed to be lots of scenes with Solomon just staring wide-eyed (see above!)."
"iquine","7","0","0","26 September 2017"," Powerful, Not Emotional
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Wait, how can you say a brutal slave movie isn't emotional? To cut to the chase, this was a well-produced, well-acted yet not well- written movie about a free African American who gets kidnapped into slavery. Unlike Amistad or other human sufferage films like The Pianist or Schindler's List, those films drew more emotion from me such as a misty eye, tears or the feeling of needing to vomit during the slave ship scene in Amistad. Yet this movie failed to connect me to the character or the story with the same depth. Perhaps it was the lack of a true goal and story/character arc. Sure ESCAPE was his goal but there wasn't a big plan so there was a lot of biding one's time and taking it day by day. And then Brad Pitt shows up which sort of takes you out of the story because there is Pitt with a beard. He was good but his inclusion and his 'star power' was jarring. There were plenty of unpleasant scenes that were powerfully brutal that made you feel various people's agony yet it didn't draw the out emotions as if they had better intertwined them in a more compelling story."
"beresfordjd","7","0","0","23 October 2016"," Disappointing
","A well made but flawed movie. My main gripe with it is the dialogue. I imagine it is authentic but the problem is that I could only catch about half of what was said. Chiwetel is great as the main character but when one can only follow parts of any conversation it spoils the effect of those parts of the script. It must have been a difficult task for the actors to treat each other so appallingly, even given they were only acting. It really is not a film that one can be said to ""enjoy"" it is more a question of appreciating it. Steve McQueen took on a difficult and even controversial subject in this film and it was never going to be a blockbuster. It has been honoured more for the subject and the bravery it took to make it than for it's quality."
"RyanCShowers","Null","4","12","9 November 2013"," A Rewatch can Change a lot
","My quirks with this one may had been conceived from the inescapable praise 12 Years a Slave underwent from critics and audiences. While I liked it the first time I saw it, I had my problems with it, the two biggest ones being the editing and McQueen's direction. The editing still has its issues that should have been worked out, but I found McQueen's direction to be one of the most valuable assets to the film this time through. 12 Years a Slave has this three-dimensional feel to it and that's thanks to Steve McQueen. The brutality the film is now famous for is thanks to McQueen, too, he held nothing back. There is a lack of sentiment still present, but it doesn't feel like McQueen's fault solely, I can't pinpoint which component made the film lack it.<br/><br/>People who watch as many movies as Oscar Buzzers can become immune to film violence, but there were three of four moments where the film crosses my line of comfort. Sadly, my opinion has lessened even more of my already mixed reaction of Lupita Nyong'O. Half the problem is her character is begging for our sympathy, but the other half is Nyong'O lack of depth and creativity. Her ""acting"" felt less like acting and more like Steve McQueen releasing violence against women and blacks in one package, cueing our tears to swell. <br/><br/>Fassbender remains my choice for Best Supporting Actor this year for his commitment performance. Ejiofor's acting ability increased on this rewatch. He uses a self-aware, theatrical manner of reciting his lines that felt fake to me before and slightly did at first this time, but the emotional exterior does more to compensate and releases a chemical that makes the ""theatrical"" element work for him. 12 Years a Slave draws a menacing template of hell on Earthan interesting metaphor, considering Brad Pitt looks like Jesus with his long hair and is the character that puts the rewarding finale into motion.<br/><br/>Updated Rating: 7.9"

His acting was just Amazing. There are lots of great actors in this movie like Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender, each given a certain amount of screen time and role and each gave a great performance, especially Fassbender, his role as an evil master was brilliant, I can smell Best supporting Oscar Nod for him. <br/><br/>The movie really makes you feel how precious freedom is. The situation of slaves, their livelihood, their condition is very well portrayed. The movie can get very brutal and unforgiving at times. <br/><br/>The cinematography was great.

"Dan_Quixote","8","3","8","18 January 2014"," Unflinching.
","When a film is as critically acclaimed as 12 Years a Slave, your expectations begin to rise, by last night, my expectations were sky- high. This can be a film's greatest ally and worst enemy. Luckily, my expectations were met. <br/><br/>I can't say I enjoyed this movie, because of how unflinching and distressing it is. The film tells the story of Solomon Northup, a free man living in Saratoga with his wife and two children. He was kidnapped by two slave-traders in 1841 and sold into slavery. On his way to New Orleans, Solomon bears witness to the harsh realities of slavery in the Deep South: such as the murder of Michael K. Williams' character. Once in New Orleans, Northup is sold by the despicable trader (Paul Giamatti) to William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a kindly Baptist slave-owner. Even though Ford is a relatively respectful and decent, Solomon still encounters struggle. Mainly at the hands of Ford's absolutely loathsome carpenter (The always brilliant and creepy Paul Dano) who attempts to murder Northup. To protect him, Ford sells Northup to a neighbouring plantation owner, Edwin Epps. <br/><br/>Epps is an absolute bastard. He treats his slaves in a way that makes Calvin Candie look like a sweetheart. Whipping them if if they did not meet the work quota he had set for them. His attraction to his star slave Patsey (The much lauded and absolutely freaking beautiful Lupita N'yongo) is met with disgust by his wife ('The Bette Davis of America', otherwise known as Sarah Paulson, who is almost worst than Epps) <br/><br/>Steve McQueen was the perfect choice for this, I imagine if Steven Spielberg had directed this, it would've ended up being sentimental and tame. McQueen doesn't shy away from the subject, presenting slavery in a stark way. His usual long takes are used effectively here, making it hard for the viewer to look away. His use of it during the hanging scene is haunting and makes it one of the best scenes of the year. <br/><br/>The film is anchored by Ejiofor's performance, who is absolutely brilliant. His emotion is mostly conveyed through his eyes. The film also has an array of fantastic performances – Fassbender and N'yongo are stunning and deserve every accolade they are receiving, Paulson is just as good. Adepero Oduye steals her scenes as a mother torn from her children, as does Alfre Woodard as a woman who has clawed her way from slavery. Dano, Dillahunt and Cumberbatch are also great. However, one of the major problems of the film is the casting of Brad Pitt – who manages to take you out of the moment entirely with his performance as Bass. Pitt's decision to use his Aldo Raine accent is baffling and simply ridiculous. <br/><br/>12 Years a Slave will be seen as important as Schindler's List in the years to come, and will deservedly win Best Picture at the Oscars. I guarantee it."

","Hmm, if you check the poster for 12yrs A Slave you'll see it has all these 5 Star reviews declaring how wonderful it is. The reality being however, it's just average. <br/><br/>I guess most reviewers are picking up on the fact that abuse to African Americans actually happened, which is of course true, and to this day, very hard to believe. But then abuse to women (for example) takes place regularly too, so if this movie featured a kidnapped woman undergoing the same abuse would it be lauded as Oscar material? I doubt it. In fact many films have been made on that subject and they've passed us by.<br/><br/>12yrs A Slave boasts many big movie stars and they do carry their roles quite well, but the reality is, this film has little in the way of story. A kidnap, some abuse, a rescue, end of. Maybe it's so ""shocking"" for some as they don't normally experience any kind of harrowing cinema? I just found the whole thing very timid indeed. But I guess old men in suits don't award true cinematic horror much value."

","Aaaaaand the Oscar goes to Chiwetel Ejiofor. He did an amazing job in ""12 Years A Slave."" Really outstanding. The movie as a whole....7/10. I think I would have scored it much higher if it had a different director. Steve McQueen's style just doesn't work for me. If you're a fan of his other films, you'll probably like this one. I have a feeling he had final cut approval of this film, and it really shows. It desperately needed an editor. A much tighter narrative would have been significantly more moving.<br/><br/>The dialogue was unusually awkward for a film of this caliber - it ripped me right out of the story. The scenes of brutality were very difficult to watch, but that was the point. The film definitely made me want to read the book (to which it is supposed to be very faithful). There was some unnecessary creation of inflammatory, fictitious dialogue which is unfortunate because the real story is damning enough. <br/><br/>The acting was mostly good (Chiwetel was fantastic, as mentioned above). Michael Fassbender's transformation into a cruel slave master was remarkable and chilling. He'll most likely win for Best Supporting Actor. Benedict Cumberbatch was great, as always. There were a bunch of really, really odd casting choices, though, that, again, ripped me from the story. Taran Killam (SNL), Garret Dillahunt (Raising Hope), Brad Pitt in a five- minute cameo. I understand that comedians often want to transfer to more dramatic roles, but I really think their addition to a production of this weighty subject matter was a huge mistake.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie you'll enjoy seeing, but if you're a fan of the cautionary tales of history and want to see a relatively faithful adaptation of a horrifying true story set in the pre-abolition US, then I think you'll benefit from seeing this film."
"Theo Robertson","8","2","5","29 March 2015"," 19th Century Moral Relativism Viewed Through 21st Century Eyes
","It''s amazing how many soundbites you can create if you had the porn . So far we've had ""torture porn"" and ""war porn"" and I did wonder if 12 YEARS A SLAVE might suffer from being ""racism porn"" ? I do remember this movie hitting cinemas and wanting to see due to the universal acclaim it received then it inadvertently ended up on my films to watch when I get a chance list then became forgotten as the awards and acclaim came and went <br/><br/>First of all some people might wonder how any civilised country could have slavery ? You have to understand the concept of moral relativism . What this means there's no absolutes of good and bad and people view life as the cultural environment they live in . Take this scenario where country A which is a democracy invades country B which is a tyranny . Country A overthrows the tyranny of country B hopes to install a democratic government in country B but this fails because the inhabitants want a government of sectarian religious tyranny . I can name at least two countries in the 21st Century where this scenario has happened and so can you . So we agree moral relativism exists ? Dare not pick me up wrong . I'm not defending slavery , What I'm doing is saying people from different eras had different mind-sets <br/><br/>I brought this topic up because I believe this is how director Steve McQueen wants us to view mid 19th Century America . A common comment about this film - or indeed McQueens other work - is he uses the camera in a detached way and makes the audience spectators to the on screen events . In academic film classes this is called ""spectatorship"" and despite the many violent scenes involving whippings and lynchings what I thought wre the most powerful scenes were the ones where 19th Century characters say sublime dialogue that seem faintly ridiculous and certainly more than a little jarring and offensive when heard in the 21st Century . A small sample <br/><br/>""Oh you poor woman , Come in and rest . You will soon forget your children"" <br/><br/>and <br/><br/>""Are you an engineer or a n-gga ?""<br/><br/>and <br/><br/>""The law says you have a right to your n-ggas"" <br/><br/>Obviously the N word is thrown about with gay abandon but the racial slurs are nothing compared to a culture that has certain people no more than property . It's not the words and concepts that are shocking ( They are ) but the real shock is watching the indifference these 19th Century characters including the slaves themselves react mainly with with total indifference . Apart from viewing 19th Century America through 21st Century eyes . McQueen makes very good use of cinematography and colour scheme <br/><br/>Where the film does have a flaw is that despite its title I never go the sensation of time passing and the whole story felt it had taken course over a short period of time . Perhaps very simple inserts showing seasons change and some slight grey streaks but in to Solomons hair would have easily rectified this . It also has a cameo from Brad Pitt in a pivotal role which does tend to take this audience member out of the film but it's due to Pitt's involvement behind the scenes that McQueen managed to get the film made in the first place and for that we should be grateful since it's a powerful and impacting movie that deserved the awards"

","""My name is Solomon Northrup. I'm a free man."" Solomon Northrup (Ejiofor) is a free man living in the north in the year 1841. One night he meets two men who offer to take him out for a drink and talk about business. When he wakes up the next morning he finds himself chained to the floor. Before he realizes what is happening to him he is shipped to the south and sold into slavery. When his new owner Edwin Epps (Fassbender) starts to break him down Solomon does everything he can to stay strong and fight for his survival and hope for freedom again. I'll start by saying before I watched this movie all I heard was that it should win Best Picture at the Oscars. So I was looking forward to watching this even though I expected it to be brutal and hard to watch in some parts. About halfway through I was left wondering what all the hype was about. The movie, to me at least, seemed very slow and boring. To me this a perfect example of a movie that makes you feel guilty for not liking it. The movie deals with a very important and serious part of history but the movie was really nothing more then look how bad slavery was, over and over. On one hand watching what Solomon goes through is gut wrenching and knowing its a true story makes it that much more powerful. On the other hand when the movie is over and you find out about the rest of his life I couldn't help but thinking if they would have done those events it would have been a better movie. This is not a terrible movie but I thought it was very overrated. Overall, one of the most important movies of the year in terms of subject, but that is different from being the Best Picture of the year. I give it a B."
"tristan_rogers","10","2","5","28 February 2014"," You Can't Look Away
","The genius of Steve McQueen in all his films is his willingness to not say cut. In Hunger and Shame, he forced us to watch unpleasant scenes for much longer than we would like and with 12 Years a Slave it is no different. The brutality and horror of the life of Solomon Northup is shown through his unyielding lens and as an audience we have no choice but to sit up and consume this harsh truth. The performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor is superlative and must catapult him to a very high plane indeed. The film is also indebted to, for my money, the best supporting actor and actress of the year in Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender. Sarah Paulson's turn as Mistress Epps is also very worthy of note. Despite Brad Pitt's late attempt to torpedo this deeply moving tale, 12 Years is a wonderful piece of work from McQueen and DoP Sean Bobbitt, whose searingly beautiful photography of the American South contrasts so powerfully with the actions of those that Northup encounters. A film not to be missed, for if you do not miss it you cannot ignore it."
"documentaryman","7","2","5","26 February 2014"," Good film but not the Best Picture of 2013
","This is a good film, maybe even an historically worthy film, but not a great film. There's little that is truly outstanding about it with the sole exception of a performance by Michael Fassbender. The rest of the cast deliver a very narrow range of emotions that are as predictable from their horribly unjust situation, as they are uninteresting.<br/><br/>It is a simple tale told well, but I'm afraid it doesn't stack up next to many of the other films nominated for Best Picture. If a work is to be judged by the three measuring sticks of aesthetics: unity, complexity, and intensity, it lacks in complexity. Severely so. In fact without Michael Fassbender's portrayal of a sexually and mentally deviant slave owner, one could imagine this film attracting no more attention than your common movie of the week.<br/><br/>American Hustle, Nebraska, Dallas Buyers Club, and even The Wolf of Wall Street are much more interesting films with far more nuanced performances and with contemporary edge. But we live in times where simple and common are celebrated by the many, and edge is uncomfortable, even with the voting majorities of many professional movie organizations, and as last years wins for the eminently forgettable Argo can attest, this film's string of wins is likely to continue with a Best Picture Oscar, after which it will be as quickly forgotten as next years's hot Reality TV show.<br/><br/>We should count ourselves lucky that great films are still being made, whether they're recognized during awards Silly Season or not."

","Reviewing this one is pretty much walking on thin ice. Let's start with pros: excellent cast performances (with outstanding Mr. Eijofor towards the end, Mr. Fassbender all the way, Miss Nyong'o and Mr. Dano, whose destiny is to play psychotic maniacs). Let's continue with the mediocre: direction, cinematography and editing. Now let's finish with bad: writing. The story is simply mixed up: writers could not decide what was important and what wasn't. The movie is simultaneously too long and too short. It has some unnecessarily extended scenes (probably symbolic but with no meaning in context), which should have been cut out, and lacks character developing. The final product a superficial portrait of an American antebellum era, even today looking almost as bad as the Nazism. To think that the capitalist economy has been built on theft, robbery, slavery and hypocrisy (justifying it through the Bible) and almost all the guilty got away with it! I guess that's why today white Americans are so patriotic: they not only took the land from the native inhabitants, but built their welfare on slavery and exploiting anyone who was not white (Chinese building railroads and so on). But, this film barely touches any of those problems as it should. It's just an excerpt from one man's (and his book) life. Nothing too deep or truly emotional, almost cheap like the articles in tabloids. This is not a good movie. It could be far more better but it isn't. It has moments (mainly main characters performances; therefore 6 stars) but as a whole fails to deliver an important message on humanity (as well as some political and moral messages) and be a movie that makes sense. And it seemed that director's intention has been just that. Well, he missed this time."
"badajoz-1","5","2","5","11 February 2014"," Worthy but very predictable and dull
","The subject of this film is so worthy, it cannot be criticised. The slavery of Africans and their descendants in the USA in the years after independence is obscene and horrific. There I've said it in a sentence - this film beats you into submission in over two hours' running time by depicting the horrors and obscenity over and over again. It has nothing new to say, and with 150 years distance between the events, we can all leave the cinema feeling good about ourselves and how much more civilised we are today. I just wonder why Samuel L. Jackson questions the movie and points out today's racism!? But back to the movie - plot, free black man is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South of America, surviving by accepting his position and not fighting back despite witnessing rape and whipping and getting plenty of lashings himself. Again one sentence's worth and you have the film of over two hours. The script is relentless - some exploration of the economics of slavery might have helped point out its ridiculous and violent meaning. The direction is full of overlong imagery that is so obvious and bores the audience. The acting is perfunctory to say the least - Chitewol Edifor almost has a permanent look of bemused disbelief as he keeps his head down, Fassbender just goes over the top as a mad man so no blame to southern citizens really then, the rest just put up a cliché of the symbol they are meant to represent, eg suffering beautiful female slave lashed to smithereens, and Brad Pitt swaggers in as a symbol of liberal Hollywood coming to rescue all 'God;s chillum.' But it packs a punch and tells a tale to remind the arrogant, greatest democracy in the world of its dark past, when most Americans looked the other way for so long. It is a pity that the aftermath of Northup's release is not touched on except in a few words over the final credits - but that would have implicated the US too much like the portrayal of the Emancipation Act in the much better 'Lincoln.' Remember 'Amistad' failed at the Box Office because of such scenes as a British sailor telling the US that the UK had long abolished slavery - Oops."
"eddie_baggins","10","2","5","3 February 2014"," A film worthy of all the plaudits
","If we're lucky a few times each year or perhaps merely once a year a film of immense grace and power will be released into our cinemas, a film that challenges us to watch when we want to turn away or challenges us to think about things we choose normally not to consider. This year (last year if you're from pretty much anywhere other than Australia) that film is 12 Years a Slave, Steve McQueen's unflinching and uncompromising telling of the true life tale of Solomon Northup.<br/><br/>For a man that has now only made 3 feature length films it's almost beyond comprehension that McQueen has so made such a fully formed and complete film as he has with 12 Years a Slave. Every aspect of the movie seems to have been pondered upon, every scene played and edited to perfection and every move of McQueen's camera capturing a moment that we the audience needs to see. A previous life as an artist has no doubt set McQueen in good stead to be able to paint a picture with his movies and having now been witness to his work here it's hard to fathom another director being able to achieve the same amount of heart that we have with this film for in brutality we find scenes of much beauty, in heartache we find solace in scenes of grace. It's a master-stroke by McQueen in his direction, yet a director with as much vision as he has shown here is nothing without his actors and that too is where the film equally shines.<br/><br/>Continuing his collaboration with now famed Irish actor Michael Fassbender, McQueen again draws out a fantastic fully committed embodiment from Fassbender as despicable yet sad soul plantation owner Edwin Epps, a drunk of a man who at any stage can turn viciously violent. It's an award quality turn by Fassbender and a turn that goes hand in hand with the career defining turn of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup. Having been around the industry for years just begging for a role worthy of his undeniable talents Ejiofor plays Northup with such care and understated soul it is again hard to fathom anyone else getting close to the work he does with the role. There are scenes throughout the movie that surely must of tested the spirit of the actor but he nails every single moment and a scene where nothing more than Ejiofor's face is to be seen his eyes tell a thousand stories, a man contemplating what is to come. It's a moment were you forget it's an actor and truly believe right there standing is Solomon Northup himself. Other actors in the piece from the startling debut of Lupita Nyong'o through to seasoned veterans Paul Giamatti and Benedict Cumberbatch all produce quality turns much like other elements of the film such as Hans Zimmer's understated yet perfect score, the production design, John Ridley's thoughtful script right through to the atmospheric cinematography, all elements of the film scream quality.<br/><br/>McQueen has crafted a heartbreaking, touching and against all odds beautiful tale that while not entertainment in any stretch of the imagination is a film deserving to be seen by as many as possible, a film that comes along once in every while and produces no grandstanding or manipulation of emotions just presents the story as the story occurred.

","As I write this, the film is regarded as one of the two most likely to win Best Picture at the Oscars. I wouldn't bet against it. But, I'm sorry, having a powerful, undeniable message like ""slavery is the greatest evil"" does not, by itself, make a film great. Steve McQueen directed ""Shame,"" which I could only endure for about 15 minutes. Like this movie, it was over the top. In that movie, it was sex that Mr. McQueen expected to fill seats in theaters. It did not seem like reality. I would be the last person to say that the worst kinds of torture and abuse were not heaped on black slaves in the United States. Of course they were. But if plantation owners spent as much of their time every day on demeaning and punishing their slaves, all of those plantations would have failed economically. Mr. McQueen filled the movie with non-stop whippings, lynchings and other abuse. Those slave owners would have done better without slaves, doing all the work themselves, if they actually devoted that much time to abusing their workers.<br/><br/>The musical score was a joke. Completely amateurish. The composer listed in the credits doesn't appear to have scored any other movies previously. The music does little or nothing to help us feel for the characters. Did Steve McQueen feel that he didn't even need good music to make a great movie? <br/><br/>Schindler's list, also a movie about genocide and the evil persecution of a people, was about a man in a good, safe position in life, who took big risks with his life for others. It had a more complex, richer story and characters. Spielberg did not try for an Oscar by delivering lengthy scenes of torture. In my opinion, this film does not deserve a Best Picture award, but it's likely to win one."
"hudini669","6","2","5","20 January 2014"," A mediocre film on an important topic
","'12 Years a Slave' is just one of those films that tries too hard to make a point which could be made much more effectively with less effort. The only reason it's being rated so high is probably the fact that there hadn't been a film about slavery made in many years.<br/><br/>First of all, any film about slavery shouldn't be made to be enjoyed and '12 Years a Slave' at first does succeed in making a viewer uneasy. However, once the plot really unravels the film becomes plagued with feelings of self-importance, overacting and stereotyped and caricatured characters, and that's where it loses all the credibility it had to begin with. It's a decent film at best, but not one that should be remembered or highly praised, especially for acting. It was particularly painful to watch female slaves cry, because every single one of them (and I literally mean, every single one) portrays crying on a pre-school play level.<br/><br/>It is obvious that '12 Years a Slave' is aiming for awards and recognition, but it simply isn't enough to cover a serious topic to make a film worthy of high recognition. Although, I believe that it will achieve both (undeservingly so in my opinion), if for nothing more than because the Academy probably doesn't want another slavery film bashed like 'The Color Purple'. However, it is irrelevant whether it wins any awards or not, '12 Years a Slave' is destined to share the fate of 'The Color Purple' - it will be marked as important and then completely forgotten.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","2","5","18 January 2014"," A brutal masterpiece that will shake you to the core
","Slavery is rightfully considered the darkest mark on America's 237-year history. It was the issue that defined 19th Century America, and one of many examples in humanity's narrative of the oppression of one people at the hands of another. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a brutal but necessary reminder of that evil. It is a film that sugarcoats nothing and struggles desperately with the entire notion of justice.<br/><br/>Director Steve McQueen makes a big career leap with this biographical epic of Solomon Northup, a free black man and talented violinist who in 1841 was kidnapped and sold into slavery, which he remained in for 12 years before a fortunate encounter with an abolitionist eventually led to his freedom. McQueen has shown a deft hand for uncomfortable subject matters (his last film, ""Shame,"" tackled sex addiction) and so slavery is something he seems apt to handle, and he does so with painful magnificence.<br/><br/>As with ""Shame,"" McQueen works diligently at transmitting the experience of his characters onto the audience, and so ""12 Years a Slave"" becomes more than a mental and intellectual exercise, but an emotional, full-body experience. It is eye-opening, heartbreaking, gut- wrenching and soul-shaking, the kind of film that will challenge you for a seemingly endless 2 hours and 15 minutes and then for a long time after you walk away from it.<br/><br/>And that seems to be the idea. McQueen doesn't want anyone who sees his film to get too comfortable, because there's nothing comfortable about what African-Americans endured as slaves. All the beating, whipping, hanging, abusing, raping and degrading slurs occur with a relentlessness arguably unprecedented in film history. Every scene featuring one of these horrific things goes on just a little longer than we expect — or what Hollywood has conditioned us for — enough so that we must really internalize it and practically beg for it to stop. Rarely do these kinds of large-scope biopics ever feel as though they occur in real time, but McQueen gives us a number of scenes that do, and it has a serious impact.<br/><br/>From the moment the drugged Solomon wakes up to find his hands and feet chained, the abuse begins. When he refuses to accept his newly given identity as Platt, a runaway slave from Georgia, he gets a brutal beating from his captors, and he continues to face violence the more he speaks up and/or demonstrates the qualities of a learned man. Solomon's decision process on how he should behave factors throughout the film. He must constantly weigh whether to hold steadfast to his identity and his beliefs at risk of provoking anger and getting himself killed, or to keep his head down and feign ignorance in order to survive.<br/><br/>This balancing act in the face of all kinds of horrific circumstances comprises Chiwetel Ejiofor's career-making performance as Solomon. Solomon works hard for the two plantation owners in the film, Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Epps (Michael Fassbender), but he must lie and manipulate to save his hide (literally in some cases) and he never stands down when mistreated or falsely accused. Then there's the underlying element of Solomon's longing for home and family, his simple but powerful motivation throughout the film. Ejiofor elicits our sympathy with ease and conveys Solomon's inner toil at countless points throughout the film with complex emotions rather than riding the more dominant ones such as anger, fear and sadness, which John Ridley's script and McQueen's direction craft so effectively.<br/><br/>Much of the film's stellar cast is difficult to praise, because they play such despicable characters. Fassbender is brilliant as Epps despite the character's countless flaws, and it's even worse because the script gives us a window into Epps' conscience, and we see him make the choice to fall victim to his pride and continue his poor behavior time after time. Even the seemingly ""better"" characters, aren't any good. Cumberbatch's Ford is a sympathetic and caring man, but one with no stones, as he accepts the slave system and does nothing to stand up to those who show true bigotry. The only praiseworthy supporting performance of a praiseworthy character is comes from Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, a young slave woman who works hard and keeps her chin up only to be struck down time and time again. What she had to do as an actress is award-worthy in and of itself.<br/><br/>McQueen pulls off what every true cinephile fantasizes about; independent directors bringing their non-traditional artistic vision to the type of film you'd expect Hollywood to make and consequently dumb down. This is not the Steven Spielberg with a sweeping John Williams score version of slavery; this is an the unapologetic, gritty, haunting and beautiful version.<br/><br/>Many will argue against the authenticity of this version, that it is excessively violent and pointlessly so, that McQueen has exaggerated and amplified the horrible nature of slavery for the purpose of shock value. Taking such a position, however, comes from a place of fear. To insist that ""12 Years a Slave"" be less brutal is to wish slavery were less brutal. Real life does not cut, fade to black or a pick a gentler angle when it comes to hate and violence. The fact that McQueen dared to take such a stance with his film and that the producers all appear to have stood behind him based on the film's final cut, deserves to be lauded as an act of true cinematic bravery. <br/><br/>Film is considered an escapist medium, but ""12 Years a Slave"" shows how powerful narrative storytelling can be when it is used to explore the deepest darkest corners of human existence, the things we prefer not to confront or talk about yet define us as much as anything. It is the kind of film that has the potential to profoundly affect your perspective as a human being and that happens so very rarely.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","This film tells the incredibly emotional story of a free man who got abducted and sold into slavery.<br/><br/>Slavery is one of the darkest stains in human history, and how people thought the whole slavery system could be right was completely beyond my comprehension. ""12 Years a Slave"" tells a story of hopelessness, fear, desolation and injustice. There are so many thought provoking quotes from the film such as ""I don't want to survive, I want to live"", these are so basic and yet powerful words. There are many powerful scenes, especially the very extended hanging scene - it's extraordinary that people could just walk past Solomon as if nothing happened. Such cold blooded behaviour is incompatible with humanity.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" is a very powerful film. The use of silence and the sparing use of music augmented the emotions, giving viewers time to ponder on the atrocities of the past. It is not an easy film to watch, but well worth the time as it makes you feel and reflect."

"Nothinggrandproductions","10","2","5","4 January 2014"," A powerful and essential piece of cinema
","Sometimes you'll watch a movie with lower expectations than need be. I brushed off 12 Years a Slave as probably another Oscar bait piece and maybe not as an enduring piece of cinema. I regret thinking in such a foolish way because it is quite possibly my favorite film of 2013. No other film from 2013 moved me so emotional, showed the brutality and the disgusting aspects of human nature in a way that needed to be shown but at the same time has this quiet beauty to it with long, lingering shots and gorgeous cinematography. It tells the real life story of a freeman in 1841, Solomon Northup played with such care and consideration by Chitwitel Ejiofor and tells the story of his 12 years where he is kidnapped into slavery. If Chitwitel Ejiofor didn't give the best performance of 2013, I don't know who did. What an incredible actor. Every shot in which his face takes up most of the frame you can see it in his eyes. The lifelessness that slavery has brought to him. How emotional broken he has become. The tears that occasional fill his eyes. It is all so incredible.<br/><br/>On top of that, this is easily the best ensemble cast of the year including actors such as Michael Fassbender as a brutal slave owner, Lupita Nyong'o as a mother ripped away from her children, Benedict Cumberbatch as a sympathetic (as sympathetic as a slaver owner can be) slaver owner, Brad Pitt as the only white man in the film who sees blacks as equal, and Paul Dano as an extremely brutal and completely lacking any sympathy plantation runner. It is one hell of a cast. And it allows the movie to come to life with such ease with these amazing performances. But, it isn't just the actors that help this movie come to life, it is the score, the cinematography, and the careful direction of Steve McQueen.<br/><br/>The score, done by Hans Zimmer who to me is either a hit or miss composer, he is hit in films like Inception and to me is a complete miss in something like The Dark Knight Rises where the score is incredibly overbearing. The score is used in slight ways, mostly with the recurring character theme for Solomon which is a beautiful composition which to be honest, sounds similar to many things Hans Zimmer is done but fits the film's tone with perfection. There is also plenty of tense, unnerving compositions written because this film is hard to stomach at points because of how brutal it is in depicting what are unfortunatelytrue events. The cinematography provides some of the most memorable aspects of the movie. Done by Sean Bobbitt, who did the cinematography for Steven McQueen's other two features (which I have not seen) but also did it for The Place Beyond the Pines which is another favorite film of mine from this year with also beautiful cinematography. Three main aspects of the cinematography caught my eye the most: The beautiful shots of nature, the incredible length that some of the shots last for, and the incredibly well-done close-ups of many of the actors.<br/><br/>Those lingering shots are what make this film a risky ambition at points in which I'm sure has to do with some of McQueen's direction. They will stayeven at parts that are hard to stomach. And it makes the movie have so much more of a lasting impression just from a simple artistic choice. It is rare to see shots linger for so long nowadays and I was throughly impressed by it. It only helps emphasize the brutality and the disgusting nature of slavery and how it is one of the worst things we have done as human beings. Never have I seen a film depict such a horrible aspect of humanity with such brutal honesty, reality, and give it the visual product it needs. Racism is still alive, don't forgot that, and even though this movie can be taken as a singular aspect of history and is something that happened well over 100 years ago, that doesn't change the fact. It deals with it up front and center and it needs to be. Overall, I haven't seen a movie from 2013-or for that matter, in general-that deals with a horrible historic event and displays it with honesty and leaves such an enduring, long-lasting impact that I'm sure won't go away long after watching-an essential piece of cinema."

","12 Years A Slave is a very honest, raw and heartbreaking depiction of Solomon Northup's story. It's something of a continuation of the themes that director Steve McQueen has worked with before, those of cruelty and injustice, but this is his most ambitious film yet.<br/><br/>And it works. This film had me in all directions emotionally, from tears of multiple emotions to total anger. It's a very important film to watch in my opinion, and for me its brilliance lies in the brutally openly told story and in the magnificent performance from all.cast members. A special mention must go to Lupita Nyongo'o, whose performance as the slave Patsy is simply incredible. The fact that this is her first film feature is nothing short of amazing and I sincerely hope she is considered for a supporting actress award.<br/><br/>In it's exploration and brutal portrayal of slavery in America, this film reminds me of Roots.

"ligonlaw","9","2","5","3 January 2014"," Tied to the Whipping Post
","Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" will sail into the awards season with the wind at its back. An excellent cast, a sensational script, first-rate directing and a soundtrack filled with gospel music portend a fine harvest of awards and statues.<br/><br/>The story is based on the experiences of a free black man, Soloman Northup, married with children. Nearly 20 years before the Civil War, Soloman is seduced by promises of excellent money into leaving his home in Saratoga, NY, to journey to Washington DC. While slavery is a fact of American life at the time, and it is legal to own slaves in some States in 1841, Soloman's life is a universe away, until he wakes up in chains, is shipped to Louisiana and sold into slavery. The harsh treatment of slaves and the outrageous notion of human beings as property is the subject explored in this film. <br/><br/>McQueen is uncompromising in his approach to the subject. The camera gets up close as the audience watches the blood and flesh torn from the backs of people tied to whipping posts. There are moment-by-moment reminders to the slaves that they have no rights. The many ways in which slavery dehumanizes people are considered: a mother is torn from her children as the family is sold to different owners; a husband will never see his family again; horrid working conditions; educated blacks must hide their literacy from the owners; any form of defiance is met with strokes from the lash; every human comfort, every expression of human decency is denied to the slave for a lifetime; every form of cruelty directed at the slave is acceptable because they are property not fellow humans. I don't recall seeing such a graphic depiction of slavery in any other film.<br/><br/>The movie is not a pleasant ride. It will make people uncomfortable to see the cruelty, and, for some, there will be shame. McQueen must have intended to create such violence and unrelenting malice so that we can feel the shame of slavery, a mutual shame. The slave is shamed by a profound sense of powerlessness, and the master class feels shame because an inferior and weak god is heartless and dark."
"MovieBuff57","9","2","5","3 January 2014"," Eye-Opening & Engrossing
","In my ignorance, I never even knew that a 'trade' existed in kidnapping black people from the enlightened northern states and literally shipping them south to the plantations as slave labour. Kudos alone to McQueen for bringing this hidden fact to the attention of the masses.<br/><br/>Opening up with a fast forward peek at enslavement for the main character sort of stole the thunder of a dramatic build-up from civilised member of society to capture and uncivilised enslavement but that's the director's prerogative I guess? <br/><br/>The comparison with the more recent Django Unchained is automatic and this movie wins hands down in that you just know it is grittier and more realistic. There's no horse-rider doing a horse-shoe shuffle (?) at the end of this movie!<br/><br/>This movie will be a front-runner for an Oscar. Less deserving movies have scooped the Oscar in recent years, but it's under more serious competition from a raft of good movies this year?"
"stew888","9","2","5","3 January 2014"," Fantastic is an Understatement
","Wow. Just, wow. Few movies are so moving as to bring me to tears, and 12 Years a Slave can now be added to that list.<br/><br/>There are several factors that contribute to this movie's ability to resonate with me so much. The cinematography and direction are fantastic thanks to the creative eye of Steve McQueen. Several scenes just seem to linger, the lens sticking around to add the emphasis that most directors would skip in favor for more action. <br/><br/>Performances from Fassbender and Ejiofor are top tier, and really create an amazingly realistic world that indeed used to exist.<br/><br/>I beseech anyone who wants to see a deep and thought provoking movie to watch this, as it is extremely good. On a side note, this movie and Django Unchained should be watched by any person who is racist or discriminates against any race, nationality, or creed. If Django displays the lunacy and cruelty of slavery in the 1800s through laughter, 12 Years a Slave does it through raw emotion and pain."

"bkrauser-81-311064","9","2","5","6 December 2013"," One of the Defining Films of the Decade
","I can say with reasonable confidence that 12 Years a Slave (2013) will stand the test of time and become one of the defining features of this decade. It is a film that puts a face and emotional resonance on the issue of slavery quite unlike any dedicated to celluloid before. It's got solid performances all-around and while award season hasn't quite hit high gear this year, I would put money on 12 Years a Slave winning big.<br/><br/>But I digress; 12 Years a Slave is based on the life of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a learned black freeman living in Saratoga Springs, New York circa 1841. He lives comfortably with two children and his wife and makes a living playing the violin. Introduced to a duo of conniving showmen, Solomon wakes up after a drunken bender in a D.C. boarding house and is told he is to be sold at slave auction. He is then transported by steamboat to New Orleans where a fellow traveler gives him life-saving advice; ""If they find out you can read, you'll be one dead n---."" Once sold at auction, Solomon spends the next 12 years working for two separate masters, one benevolent and kind (for a slave-owner anyway), the other covetous and cruel. ﻿ I could go on forever simply describing Solomon's galling journey experiencing first-hand one of America's biggest crimes against humanity. It's one thing to read about slavery through textbooks; It's another thing to feel like you've witnessed it first hand. You may not feel the lashes of the whips but you can almost smell the sweat escaping from Solomon's pores, taste the salty tears of every misfortune and feel you heart beating in your throat at every tense moment.<br/><br/>You can accredit this exchange of empathy to the brilliant acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor, an actor who up until now was known to me as the guy from the underrated Talk to Me (2007). You may know him as the baddie from Serenity (2005) but after this movie, you may well know him as Academy Award winner Chiwetel Ejiofor, taking his place among the unfortunately small group of black actors who have taken home top prize. <br/><br/>But lest you think 12 Years a Slave is a one man show, Michael Fassbender plays a sadistic slave-owner by the name of Edwin Epps with aplomb. I truly hated his character not because for his barbarism but for his human frailty. He takes out his lack of fortitude on his slaves all the while convincing the audience that such a person likely existed and isn't a caricature or composite of ignorant, immoral Southern plantation owners of the day. Also to look for is Lupita Nyong'o and Sarah Paulson, who play Epps's favorite slave and his jealous wife respectively.<br/><br/>What is most impressive and most disheartening about the whole sordid tale is how impossibly ordinary the events of the story are. Director Steve McQueen tries hard to create a sense of normalcy through extended pauses on the shocking treatment of slaves juxtaposed with everyday happenings in the background. There is one scene where Solomon is almost lynched for talking back to a plantation supervisor. As Solomon is left alone with a noose around his neck, black children play in the background undisturbed by Solomon precariously tiptoeing on the ground to prevent choking. People are bought, sold, beaten, lynched and raped all with a perverted sense of the everyday.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave to me not only speaks volumes about the world that once was, before trading in human flesh was abolished, it speaks to the condition of the world today. What things do we consider everyday, and even mundane that those in generations to come will judge us for? Will there ever be another time slavery will become common place? I like to think not for as the great Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."" I don't think I'm giving much away by saying Solomon never got to see that justice in his lifetime. Many including myself contend we will not see true justice in respect to slavery for a good long time. Yet we can all agree that the hard lessons learned from slavery should never be forgotten. Thank goodness we have Steve McQueen and 12 Years a Slave to make sure we won't.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

One of the things that I witnessed that truly moved me was not what I saw on screen but what was taking place within the theater. I saw men & women, young & old, black & white sitting together and experiencing one of the best movies about slavery that I've ever seen. We experienced the full spectrum of emotions together. This is truly a must see."
"cultfilmfan","10","2","5","1 December 2013"," 12 Years a Slave
","Steve McQueen's masterful, 12 Years a Slave, is one of the most hard hitting and powerful films that I have ever seen. The film is brutal in it's depictions of slavery and the unjust treatment and attitudes that were directed towards African Americans at that time. The film, which is based on a true story, is a film of tremendous artistic merit and also when you watch the film and leave the theatre, it leaves a profound effect on you. After the film was done and I was watching the end credits roll, I felt a lump in my throat and my eyes were beginning to irritate me because they were becoming watery and deep down inside my body and my soul, I knew that I had just seen an excellent and undoubtedly accurate depicture of mankind at one of it's lowest and most unforgivable times. I hated watching these slave landowners in the film and I felt deep down in my heart, both empathy and pity for the way these characters were treated by these racist and evil men. The film hit home in such a way that after I left the theatre, I was quiet for quite some time both getting over emotionally, what I had just saw and witnessed, but also the feeling the film left me with which was as I mentioned a feeling of horror and disgust and also a sense of awe and sheer appreciation towards filmmaker Steve McQueen and his wonderful cast and crew for creating a film based on facts and bringing it to be so lifelike and realistic that the film left a profound impact on me and left me with a lot to think about afterwards. Yes, the film is brutal in it's depiction of what these slaves go through and at times it can be extremely hard to watch because the film does not shy away from the brutality, mistreatment and torture that these slaves went through. It can be hard to watch, but at the same time, I felt the decision the filmmakers chose, to show the film in that intense detail was what added to the film's power and the overall effect it left on me. I know that unfortunately some may shy away and decide not to see the film for that very reason, but I strongly urge those viewers to reconsider, because 12 Years a Slave, is a film that I honestly think that everybody should see. It's important to see because of the injustice and poor treatment that is basically a part of our history and a part of history that should not be forgotten, or ignored. At the same time it presents an unpleasant and harsh look at American history, it also shows that in some ways things have improved over a span of several hundred years. Right now America, has their first African American President of the United States of America. Whether you are a fan of Barack Obama's policies, or not, is not important here. What is important is that as a people we have come forward a little bit. Something like that would not have even been dreamed of in the days of slavery, or even the racist attitudes going through the 1950's and 60's, but I think we are on the right path in a way. Unfortunately though, you will still have people who are set in their closed minded and bigoted ways who through their own learning and behaviour, still harbour racist attitudes. I know I have met and heard of people like that and I think that we all know that it still exists. These are some reasons I am still glad that 12 Years a Slave was made. It was a powerful portrait of one man's hellish journey through slavery and the many others he met while there as well. The film boasts an incredible cast who all deliver top notch and Oscar caliber performances. The screenplay is excellent by both drawing us in and keeping us glued to our seats and by invoking power, feelings and thought through it as well. The cinematography was beautiful and Steve McQueen's direction paid much attention to detail and helped further the message I think the film was trying to leave on the audience. I also liked how the film did not use bombastic music, or fake sentimentality to make us cry, or to get the emotional feelings across to the viewer. I felt the way I did at the end of the film and during it because the film made me care for these characters because these events actually went on and seeing them in their brutality and allowing us to care for these characters and the injustice they went through, hits home in a way that my writing could not do justice to. Let me just say that this, as I mentioned above, is one of the most powerful and emotionally overwhelming films I have ever seen. There are still a lot of 2013 films that I haven't seen and still need to see, but as it stands now, the one that should be taking home Oscar gold next year is clearly and undoubtedly in my mind, 12 Years a Slave. Don't miss it while it is still in theatres. One of the best films of 2013 and one of the most powerful and moving films of all time."
"Manal1987","8","2","5","26 November 2013"," McQueen Does It Again.
","I've said it before and I'm saying it once again: Steve McQueen is a visual artist in every sense of the word. He fully understands the power of the image and brilliantly exploits that in channeling his message. McQueen's films are not made to entertain (those who watched Hunger and Shame will know what I mean); his films are made to shock and engage. He uses gruesomeness to shock, and visual beauty to engage.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is shockingly powerful in its adherence to reality and its details. The audience are forced to watch the graphic whipping and torture scenes, and McQueen unapologetically elongates those scenes and strips them of any non-diegetic music so as to deepen their realistic effect. Watching a man hanged to a tree and trying to keep his toes to the ground for a few seconds is an awful thing to watch, and will naturally instigate feelings of pity and sympathy. However, watching the same man with his relentless endeavors to keep standing on his toes for more than 3 or 4 minutes is definitely an agonizing experience for the viewers. The persistence of the silent and still shot invades your comfort zone and forces you to identify with the man.<br/><br/>But being gruesome does not mean the film is not beautiful. Aesthetically speaking, 12 Years a Slave is a cinematographic feat. McQueen's visual trademarks are easily spotted (and admired). Each frame is a triumphant work of art; the placement of the camera, the colors, and the mise-en-scene are all done so carefully that I did not mind having those 'McQueeny' still shots all the time. Each frame is a beautiful painting with an elaborate statement.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, all actors excelled, even though some of them had really small roles. And of course, Ejiofor and Fassbender were phenomenal (surprise, surprise!). The only thing I could not understand is the presence of Brad Pitt in the film. His character is small but important in terms of plot line, but to have him pull this weird southern accent of his and talentlessly preach about slavery is completely annoying! I believe Pitt was used only for publicity; just another big name on the movie's poster.<br/><br/>I don't know why but whenever I write a review on any of McQueen's movies, I end up writing about McQueen himself and his idiosyncratic style (that's how good he is!). Maybe because it is not about what he presents but how he presents it. 12 Years a Slave is a slavery movie but not the usual slavery-is-bad-don't-do-it-again movies. It goes beyond the main theme and takes you by the hand to gruesome/fragile condition of the human soul."

You might think that this opening question is coming out of nowhere, but bear with me. To have lived with that precious gift and then to be forced to live without seems even more tragic and cruel. The loss must be all the more staggering. I bring this question to the forefront as it is the inescapable sense of loss that is the underlying concept in 12 Years A Slave, Steve McQueen's relentless and searing account of human trafficking, a true tale about Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejoiofor), an African-American musician who, in the earlier stages of his life, was a free man enjoying his life with his wife and family in the, only to be whisked away, bounded and shackled to spend most of his later years (1841 -1853)as a slave in the Old South.<br/><br/>The desire for freedom always is just out of reach as we follow Solomon's harrowing journey. From free man to slave, his suffering in this film is palpable, as we witness scenes of persecution and endless humiliation packaged between moments of sadness and despair. <br/><br/>Be forewarned: 12 Years A Slave is not an easy film to watch, as this viewer diverted his eyes from many sadistic acts of violence throughout the film. The torture and inhumane conditions are true representations of America's reprehensible past. The brutality seen in 12 Years A Slave is never gratuitous or used as a mere shock value stunt. It's there in full view, shown as it was then, and now chronicled and unable to be ignored.<br/><br/>The privileges of whiteness and the freedom that came with that segregated class system has a more visceral effect in this film, seen in sharp contrast to the servitude and brutality that many slaves endured at countless plantations from master to master. The film's most convincing argument is how effortlessly injustice can marginalize one man's life.<br/><br/>Mr. Ejoiofor is exceptional in his role as Solomon. The actor's use of his physical traits, his woesome and sad-eyed facial expressions and continued downward stare, subtly show the inner rage and helplessness of his character. His final scene is so moving and memorable, allowing the emotional release for his character and for the movie-going audience as well. As the villainous psychotic slave owner Epps, Fassbinder has the showier role and he tends to overplay the sexual depravity of the character with a tad too much glee. Yet the actor does register the proper degree of instability and intimidation, avoiding the aspects of a full-blown Simon Lagree stereotype. (McQueen should have reined the actor in at times, which would have made this excellent performance all the more real and effective.)<br/><br/>The acting is stellar with strong supporting work by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye, and Alfre Woodard. Special mention goes out to the contributions of Lupita Nyong'o as the abused slave, Patsey, and Sarah Paulson as Epps' shrewish wife. Both actresses deserve Oscar nominations for their fine work in this drama. Only Brad Pitt seems miscast in his role due to his famous screen persona. (Yes, he's one of the film's producers, but a lesser known actor would have given the film the right degree of realism.)<br/><br/>Director McQueen, along with his co-writer, John Ridley, have created a film of undeniable passion and haunting imagery, a mostly accurate and horrific history lesson for all of the world to see. His wonderful production team have crafted an indelible re-creation of pre- Civil War authenticity with stellar work from Patricia Norris' period costumes, Hans Zimmer's atmospheric music score, realistic sets by Adam Stockhausen and David Stein, and stunning cinematography by Sean Bobbit.<br/><br/>There are so many memorable set pieces that are skillfully handled for maximum effect (a horrible lynching scene that seems to go on until tomorrow, Solomon overcome with despair and rage as he sings a spiritual, a burning letter that turns to embers and fades to black). There are some scenes that do go on far too long and overstate their message (a chase sequence between Epps and Solomon goes so over-the-top to the point of absurdity that it undercuts some of the film's emotional impact). More judicious editing could have solved that very minor complaint. (Also having a rather jarring effect is McQueen eagerness to show historical accuracy on one hand, yet the director tends to overlooks the fact that his actors (portraying either slaves or owners) seem to have taken so much special care on their dental work that the American Dental Association would have unanimously given the film its seal of approval. That said, the film is still a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.<br/><br/>12 Years A Slave is a bold provocative film that forever shatters the myth of gentrifying the Southern Antebellum lifestyle. McQueen's film never hides from or whitewashes one of the most tragic chapters of American history. Its powerful story of one man's anguish and loss of freedom should resonate with any caring individual. Sadly, racism still exists in many parts of our country today. With such an important film like 12 Years A Slave as our ultimate proof, the lesson is well earned, if not yet well learned.

","I thought this movie did an excellent job of revealing the harsh treatment of blacks in the south in the United States before the Civil War. The acting is tremendous, particularly the lead role. You are conveyed the sense of why it is impossible to run. You see how any kind of society based on slavery brings out the worst in people, not just those who run the plantations, but everyone else who has to live within the system. I would recommend seeing this, but it is not for the light of heart, you will feel the constant fear, and the pain of the whip, faced by the slaves on a daily basis. Be prepared to get a more in depth look at the world of slavery than has been seen before."

","This is definitely a hard film to get through. The scenes are so raw and the language as well, I often had to close my eyes. However I left the theater feeling like I so appreciated what millions of African Americans went through in order for people of color to be able to walk freely. Go see this movie...the acting is great and the cinematography is as well. There are many still shots that convey such emotion and character, at times I had to look away. I did wonder what happened to his family during the 12 years, as this isn't really explored in the film, but I guess that's not what the focus of the film is about. Overall, this is an excellent movie and I would certainly see this again."

"FilmMuscle","7","2","5","10 November 2013"," An Emotionally Draining and Thought-Provoking Cinematic Event
","With 12 Years a Slave comes a dour and distressing story about Solomon Northup, a freedman and a talented violinist, who was kidnapped one night and sold into slavery. This true story vividly captures his struggles and grueling journey through a very dark time. Now, slavery has recently become a relevant topic even though it no longer exists, but several films have released nonetheless, forcing us to relive the horrors that beset a once troubled race. As a matter of forewarning, this film is raw and relentless in its presentation for it's bound to disturb and place you in a level of discomfort that's rarely visited. You will be forced, as a viewer, to witness atrocious scenes of torture and whippings specifically as misty blood sprays into the air and the sight of deep and thick cuts makes you cringe to no end. By the end of the film, half of the theater was in tears, blowing their noses and withdrawing their tissues. It was certainly difficult to bear the missed opportunities and even larger troubles in a stricter environment. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the most crucial services to the power of this picture relates to its performances. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, and Lupita Nyong'O all putting in terrific effort and fully exhausting us with deep emotion. In addition, the rest of the supporting cast features the likes of Brad Pitt, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Benedict Cumberbatch, and more- very impressive indeed. At the rolling of its credits, we are officially drained of any sense of happiness. Though the film isn't economic and takes its time with some ironic shots of beauty and others of a grim terrain, it's mercilessly saddening once its content fully sinks in and you understand the ""bigger picture."" The film's pacing relaxes in certain moments as particularly lengthy shots are utilized in order to realistically depict a situation, excluding any cinematic distractions. As I've mentioned before, this method produces the kind of footage that's raw and gritty; a scene will persist as it's gradually encompassed by a hopeless tone and hurtful details. <br/><br/>What packs the punch to the fullest extent of emotion is the incredible score by Hans Zimmer. It does sound a bit like Inception's soundtrack, but it's undoubtedly effective in its complement to a disheartening segment. ""I survive! I will not fall into despair...I will kick myself harder until freedom is opportune."" Powerful words are spoken, and although a film with such subject matter could've easily hit the point of excessive sentimentality and corny dialogue, the conversations actually carry some very strong points. This experience is arguably an incredibly important one, which is likely why it's garnering this amount of praise and hype. <br/><br/>The treatment of the white supremacist race towards a seemingly dissimilar kind can apply to any generation of our history and though the relationship isn't nearly as cruel, the feeling of utter discrimination is what faces both immigrants and homosexuals in contemporary times. Frankly, it's fascinating how modern peoples remain disgusted by these practices, but if you were to somehow teleport them to the age of slavery, would they feel exactly the same way? Racism has not ceased to exist, and most of the informed and aware would surely agree. Hopefully, this film will stir awareness within the more ignorant and prejudiced; I won't point any fingers, but you know. Upon viewing such atrocities, I can't imagine how society of the past could possibly deem such a way of life and action rightful. Of course, we could delve into philosophy and human nature, regarding greed and selfishness, for a considerable period of time, but I'd rather not. <br/><br/>With that being said, I honestly don't think it innovatively accomplishes anything but its emotionally compelling execution is what the applause might be directed at, at least for me. Several sequences, though, contain rather muttered speech that somewhat complicated the state of affairs as I couldn't find myself making out what the characters were exactly speaking of. 12 Years a Slave will shock you and leave you in contemplation and vexation. It will be one of those events in cinema where the audience shouldn't be expecting excitement, enchanting visuals, or mindless action but a truly thought-provoking production that will formidably rival the best films this year."

","Just before I lower my hand towards my keyboard, I wonder to myself. Am I about to write a review or simply a statement about my disappointment in others? In any case I feel the need to mention It's been a long time since I saw 12 Years a slave. Although I've tried several times to revisit, It's been too painful for me to do so. And the conclusion I bare is that it is for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>With the exception of Paul Dano's appearance in 12 years a slave, there's really not that much effort to salute. The film contains a long, repetitive, slow-paced series of scenes bombarded with torture and dullness. Whether the monologue, the sudden appearance of American ""heroes"" or the actual physical torture of black people, It's quite frankly just the same. Surprisingly enough, for the popular audience and the Academy, the blatant manipulative sob-structure actually works like a charm. As the (what feels like Satantango-length-ed) 12 years a' bored claimed endless praise and affection. Even so much that it became the winner of the biggest competition (eh?) of them all in the film industry. The Oscars became the Eurovision Song Contest and the world was just about to deem Only God Forgives a ""bad film"". <br/><br/>I have a distant memory of a scene where the main characters life hangs by a thread as he's hung to a tree by a hangman's noose. It was a perfectly decent scene polluted by the previous and those to come. Unfortunately, 12 years a slave reminds me all too much of The shawshank redemption and all the boredom, dullness and manipulation the audience had to endure. Much like Kubrick, Steve Mcqueen and the man *presumably* that made Shawshank, borrows the art/tricks of the commercial industry in cinema. However, the difference in usage makes for a discrepancy of monumental magnitude. A couple of years later I'm left with one question: Did 12 years a slave have a narrator? Because it sure felt like it did. <br/><br/>3/10 For Dano, the scenery and effort."

","I just watched this film for the first time on Netflix today. I found this movie very confronting and at times horrific. I don't know a great deal about slavery in America in this time but I didn't realize it was so inhumane. Although this film is touching and one can really can sympathize with the main character the brutalities are horrific. The scene with the young girl 'Patsey' getting lashed was extremely hard to watch. It really puts life in these times into perspective, I can't imagine what people in those times must of endured. All in all the actors were amazing acting these parts and the movie was touching and definitely one that is hard to pull away even at the confronting parts. I had never seen the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor before but in this movie he was outstanding and he deserved the BAFTA award 100%."

","The director did a pretty good job. Apparently he knows that there will be no mistake making a movie about slavery, which always win some awards and get overrated since everyone is too afraid to be called: ""racist"". Let's say, if there is a movie about racial inequality or slavery, you have to tell yourself it is a good movie, regardless of how boring, how poorly made it is (not saying this movie is bad), otherwise you are a ""racist""! This movie is good, but far from being great. I believe all men and women are created equal and judging others by race is terribly wrong. However I also believe that if a nation really want to be prosperous and earn respects.

","In December 2012, SHAME (2011) – the director's previous effort starring Michael Fassbender (who appears in this one as well) – was among the top contenders for the European Film Awards held here in Malta; I opted to watch it at the time, and recall not being exactly admiring of the end result. 12 YEARS A SLAVE, then, took McQueen to Hollywood and a theme presumably close to his heart (being a black man, despite his British pedigree) i.e. an ostensibly true account of slavery in the Deep South a few years before it was eventually abolished; on the other hand, Fassbender had already been featured in Quentin Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) – supporting Brad Pitt, who himself assumes a small role in the movie under review apart from co-producing it! Well, the film is slated to win a number of its nine Oscar nominations (including Best Picture!) come Sunday: the other nods being for Direction, Actor (a reasonably impressive Chiwetel Ejiofor), Supporting Actor (Fassbender incessantly hamming it up!), Supporting Actress (Lupita Nyong'o – whose hardly outstanding talent is only evident in a few instances!), Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Production Design (this category seems to be referred to as Art Direction/Set Decoration no longer!) and Costume Design. <br/><br/>From my average rating, one can gauge that my reaction to this was lukewarm: there are several reasons for it but, chief among them, is the fact that, rather than seeming its own film, 12 YEARS A SLAVE feels like bits and pieces from older titles relating to the subject matter concerned (notably GOODBYE UNCLE TOM {1971}, MANDINGO {1975} and DJANGO UNCHAINED {2012}). However, none of these had mustered quite the level of gravitas that so wears McQueen's approach down – exemplified by various shots, songs (for what it is worth, the entire score tends towards over-emphasis) and even cries that linger on endlessly in its striving to make some point or other! – while also coming off in its copious whipping sequences as the most gloatingly sadistic mainstream release since THE PASSION OF THE Christ (2004)!! To which must be added its parade – a caricatured depiction, if ever there was one – of obnoxious ""white trash"": not just behaving boorishly towards the slaves which they treat as property to be utilized in any way they deem fit (most reprehensibly by Fassbender's perpetually grumpy spouse, who throws a whiskey glass container in the face of hubby's favourite Nyong'o!) but proving Bible-thumping hypocrites into the bargain!! For the record, Ejiofor is the cultured and music-playing real-life protagonist (on whose book the script is based) – a free black man 'shanghaied' from New York to the Deep South, but ultimately reclaimed and returned to his family by a former ""master"" – whereas Pitt turns up intermittently during the last third as a sympathetic carpenter (sporting an unbecoming Amish-type beard!) who likewise has a hand in the hero's renewed liberation; the extensive cast list also showcases the likes of Paul Giamatti and Benedict Cumberbatch."

This movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a while and it has an incredibly moving story. The role played by all the actors in this movie are great and it made you believe that you were actually watching a documentary about slavery rather than a motion picture.

","Solomon Northup is a free and respectable black man living in 1860s New York. While in the South for a gig, he is kidnapped and sold into slavery, where he witnesses and experiences unspeakable cruelties. Renamed Platt, he is sent to work for a plantation owner Ford, who is relatively benign. But Solomon soon incurs the wrath of the overseer, and after an attempt on his life, he is sent on to Abernathy, a man with the reputation of being a ""nigger-breaker"". Abernathy is not only cruel, but preys on another young slave, Patsy, and regularly twists the Bible to justify his actions. Rescue eventually comes through the help of a white Canadian man, a builder hired by Abernathy. Opposed to slavery, he agrees to write to Solomon's family.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave provided a very personal and insightful look at slavery in 19th century America. There were several scenes of extreme cruelty (beatings and lashings) that made me want to look away, but I think they were necessary to bring across the slaves' plight. It's one thing to read about how they were viewed as lesser beings and treated like commodities, but the reality only hits home when you see it portrayed on-screen. The acting was excellent and I loved how shots of nature were used to transit between different scenes - they helped to set the context and highlighted the bareness of the slaves' existence. One particular line from the movie stood out for me - Solomon said that he didn't want merely to survive, but to live. To me, this encapsulates what is so wrong about slavery. While I can't exactly say that I enjoyed the movie, it's most definitely worth watching."
"i_ianchev","10","2","6","1 February 2014"," Human Dignity
","Here's why my favorite movie of 2013 is ""12 years a slave""...<br/><br/>A film about human dignity and the will to survive. Overcoming the emotions which flow through me when I talk about this movie, I am certain that I must write about it. It is a cinematographic masterpiece that deserves your attention. Based on the true story of Solomon Northup and his memoir book ""Twelve Years a Slave: Narrative of Solomon Northup, citizen of New-York, kidnapped in Washington city in 1841, and rescued in 1853, from a cotton plantation near the Red River in Louisiana"" this artwork is a revelation. A revelation about how we humans can treat each other and to what extend we can suffer. It is hard to talk about slavery, because it is not a widespread ""disease"" in today's society. But every human being which feels and thinks will be touched by this story. There are many morals coming out of Steve McQueen's work, but I guess the most important one is about how a person cannot easily forget injustice. And that's exactly why the vile actions depicted in the story are so monstrous. But against them we are seeing the flickering hope and human dignity which illuminate the path to salvation. I was in awe especially from the small, but significant moments of truth when Solomon stayed by himself and tried to keep his memories - who he is, that he has his loving family and ultimately about his nature as a FREE person.<br/><br/>As spectators we are moved by the wonderful play of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch. I only wish that by watching this true story of the survival of human dignity we embrace each other as nations and as people even more. We are all children of our planet and we all have the equal right to call ourselves FREE men and women.<br/><br/>It is essential to quote Brad Pitt's character Bass at the end of this review: ""Laws change. Social systems crumble. Universal truths are constant. It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all."""
"sesht","Null","2","6","31 January 2014"," Soul trade
","This one deserves all the plaudits being heaped upon it, and it's interesting that we get to see another 'Southern', without the tongue-firmly-in-cheek brand of Tarantino excess - the other cheek, as it were. Ironic that both Fassbender and Pitt, the couple of Inglourious basterds (that one ended up 'counseling' earlier this year), ended up (not exactly) front-and-center of the other side (the true one) of 'Django unchained'. <br/><br/>For the serious part though - this is a story of survival that needed to be told. Not sure how timely this is, but the very fact that humans can, and did, behave the way the characters of Fassbender/Dano/Paulson/Giamatti/McNairy/Dillahunt did, and get away with it all, day-after-day, and got to spout god's name, shows how every goddamn religious travesty had, and still has, the ferocity and hyperbole of fanaticism tinged in each verse, so to speak. The life that Northup had to lead during those 12, the lives he had to tread on, speaks volumes of the absolute lack of nobility in action, and only in impotent intent, that most of us inhabit even today. Solomon Northup may have gotten free, but he had already lost his soul, perhaps for no fault of his.<br/><br/>Powerful enough to make a commercial movie-mad audience sit in rapt silence throughout. Not a single call/text (I kid - there was that One call, that went on and on) to interrupt the proceedings, ensuring that we lost our souls along with Solomon. Not to be missed, though sadly not for everyone.<br/><br/>Now, will there be a part 2? I'd definitely wanna watch 'Northup and the underground railroad'.<br/><br/>PS: I'm unable to get Monsieur Hans Zimmer's music outa my head."

It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. This Astonishing, heartbreaking ,Powerful and Gripping story really dose bring you to tears & anger over how these people were treat over there colour just for slaves & money,this is the very reason why i hate the human race at time there no reason what so ever to treat these people this way it upset me that we as a human race let this going on back in the 18th century. This is one film that has left me speechless as the credits rolled with shock , i was in tears by the end of it as it such a beautiful & powerfully made film I've ever seen in a while, that gave this story justice. The trailer just doesn't do this film any justice really, you really have to see this film for yourself to see why this is a very powerful film, with some of the best performances from all the cast & actors, i was Surprised to see a cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch & Brad pitt who's few lines really made his character a good man standing up against slavery brilliant done for a 5 min scene.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth I seriously can't express the anger, the emotional feel i got from watching this its that shocking you get the feel you just want to walk out the room because what you see in this film was very brave but the story of one man struggle from being a free man to be tricked & sold into slavery really make every emotion come out of you.12 years a slave is a masterpiece of a film that is one film i seriously recommend you watch."
"Robert_duder","8","2","6","15 December 2013"," Critical darling impresses but didn't floor me
","Let's just get this out in the open...12 Years A Slave will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Picture. I'd put every dime on it...99% guaranteed. It has everything the Academy loves. It comes in on the tails of the impressive Django Unchained which was a very different style of slavery story but still shares some common ground. A tale set in the South during the mid-late 1800's seems to me to be an easy spot to write a good story that moves people. 12 Years A Slave does exactly that. It has a few unique ideas in it but at the same time it didn't really bring anything new to the table either. There were some very good performances, very good scenes and a powerful story. It was a great film. Best film of the year? I'm not entirely sure. I felt like some of the sexual scenes were forced and gratuitous and unnecessary. I also understand what they were trying to convey with some of these scenes. 12 Years A Slave does one of the best jobs I've ever seen of making you understand the intense humiliation of slavery. The story is very different given this is about a free man from the North who is kidnapped and sold into Southern slavery. Its a terrifying idea and the things he must go through will move you. This is a film that puts you firmly in the shoes of a man forced into slavery and every humiliating aspect. He is an educated, intelligent family man forced into this condition and its hard to watch at times.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor is our lead character. He is good in the role and certainly conveys a lot of different emotions and is very believable in the part. I have no beef with his performance at all. At the same time I wasn't blown away by him. There was one particular performance better in the film than him and he was great but I don't think it was a mind blowing performance. He will certainly get an Oscar nomination but I'm just not sure he deserves to win. In her film debut Lupita Nyong'o is very impressive. Her character is literally tortured and humiliated throughout the film more than any other and watching her is gut wrenching. She is a very talented actor and she shines in a very hard role. Her chemistry with Ejiofor is very good and she deserves her accolades, especially for her first big screen role. I think the best performances in this movie came from the supporting cast. Michael Fassbender is stunning...he is stunning in the way that I expected Ejiofor to be. Fassbender's drunken, religious fanatic, slave owner is twisted and electric and demented. Its an Oscar worthy performance to say the least. Sarah Paulson's smaller role as his wife is also noteworthy because I thought she was amazing too in the few scenes she had. Benedict Cumberbatch is very good as Ford, of the slave owners but one who tries to treat Northrup with some form of respect. Paul Dano is amazing as one of Ford's overseers. Dano has maybe ten or fifteen minutes on screen and is absolutely memorable. Brad Pitt also makes an appearance in a small role near the end of the film. He produced the movie and I'm not sure he should have given himself a role. I very much like Brad Pitt and I think he's a terrific actor but whether he likes it or not he's a mega superstar and its distracting to see him suddenly show up 3/4 of the way through the film. He doesn't particularly impress and its a small role.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen sort of began to get noticed with Hunger and then Fassbender's last big critical darling ""Shame"" which I have yet to see. McQueen creates an epic feel to the film but sometimes I think he forgets we need to understand the world they live in and not just the horrific things happening to them. I expected more emotion to some of the characters and I mean there is no doubting some of the more powerful scenes but this is such an incredible story and such a hard subject that it required something more. It is a great movie but for all the hype and the fact that it is likely to watch away with the best picture of the year...it needs more. It is however much better than last year's Argo so I can live with its status. Absolutely see this film because it is important and well made and well acted. A very important historical movie. 8.5/10"

","I went into this film anticipating solid directing (Steve McQueen) and good acting (Ejiofor, Cumberbatch and Fassbender), if an unoriginal story. Every few years, it seems, we get another installment of ""White Guilt: the Movie."" I was not disappointed by the former, and pleasantly surprised by the latter. The film follows the slave story we all know(bearing not a little resemblance to Frederick Douglass's more widely known memoir), but with the twist that the protagonist was born free and kidnapped into slavery. We see Solomon object that he is free then beaten into submission, and made to accept his name(Platt) and his station. He travels first to a slave auctioneer's, played by a very understated(and possibly underused) Paul Giamatti. He is auctioned off at a higher price for his ability to play the violin. He goes to a compassionate owner played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who makes excellent use of screen time to turn an otherwise one-note character, into a conflicted man of principles. He gains favor with his master for his intellect, while also running afoul of the wicked overseer(played gratingly by the ever-punchable Paul Dano; seriously I was hoping for Daniel Day Lewis to show up with a bowling pin) for the same savvy. There is a disagreement that leads to the overseer trying to flail him. He instead turns on and whips the overseer. He ends up at the end of a noose, but is saved from death, only to dangle for a squirmingly long amount of screen time, unflinching and unyielding in it's brutality as he shifts from toe tip to toe tip to keep his windpipe intact. This act serves as the apex of the cycle. Master Cumberbatch must then sell him to keep a lynch mob from killing him, but the only master who will accept him is a cruel one. Enter Michael Fassbender, chewing his way through every scene and reveling in the evil Master Epps. He and McQueen could've been content in letting the characterization end there since Fassbender creates it masterfully, but they add in a touch of self-loathing and doubt that makes him a real, albeit horrific, person. His inclination toward his favored slave, Patsey, puts our protagonist into predicament. The cycle comes back around as Platt is forced whip Patsey in the worst flaying scene since ""Passion of the Christ."" He becomes the reluctant purveyor of the lash. It is now that he breaks his violin, before the talisman that linked him to his old life and his intelligence, and resigns himself to his yoke. He joins in song wholeheartedly, while before he sat in silence. He has become the archetype slave. Earlier on, he attempted to send a letter by way of a white hired hand that had drank himself into debt, who betrayed him to his master. It is later, through trusting a second hired man, a forward-thinking Canadian abolitionist(played to great distraction by Brad Pitt, sounding much more like Benjamin Button than any Canadian, that he actually does regain his freedom. And, as before he had to have the name Platt beaten into him, he is coaxed into revealing his true identity to the sheriff, and taken away home. His reunion scene with his family leaves lingering warm feelings; until the scrolling text reveals that no one paid for this crime. A fantastic film that chose earnest over preachy, and visceral over cliché. The performances were spot on(aside from Dano's screechy one-note and Pitt's aforementioned out-of-place cameo), and deserve both Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'O(Patsey) at least a nomination for supporting actor/actress, while Chiwetel Ejiofor definitely should get a nod for best actor, and hopefully start getting some long-overdue credit. McQueen, meanwhile, remains artful, if not gruesome in his depiction of slave life. He and Nicholas Winding Refn are contending for art-house shudder king. An excellent piece, definitely bringing something more than a rehash of a familiar story, even if the story is familiar."
"knightofdarkness08","9","2","6","25 November 2013"," Very hard to watch but well crafted and must be seen by everyone
","This movie has a very good balance of being a great movie that keeps you hooked and a film showing you the horrors of slavery in explicit detail. This movie throws in some excellent performances like our main star Chiwetel Ejiofor and a brilliantly horrifying performance from Michael Fassbender. This movie must have been a great challenge because many great films have been made about this subject,to be remembered this movie had to be truly mesmerizing which it is. Like I mentioned earlier this movie is not a two hour gore fest that sends messages down your throat, we get to know the characters first and when bad things happen to them we are even more horrified. A lot of talent is shown in this movie and in my opinion it ranks up there with some of the best racial movies. Overall this is a very good film that will be remembered for a very long time and must be seen by everyone."
"Turfseer","6","2","6","15 November 2013"," Modern day progenitors may be blamed for the ""sins of the fathers"" in this faithful adaptation of an 1853 slave memoir
","Having read some excerpts from the book the film is based on, it appears that this is a very thorough adaptation of Solomon Northrup's original account which was written at the time of course as an expose-to sway northern conservatives who might have been on the fence concerning the horrors of slavery.<br/><br/>
The danger here is that a ""19th century"" story can have a whole different meaning when presented in a modern day context. Director Steve McQueen already established himself as having a talented visual eye but also an unhealthy obsession with violence (his disappointing fictional effort, ""Shame,"" focused on a protagonist's sexual fixation). Thus McQueen (in the grand style of Tarantino), may have been drawn to Northup's tale more for the salacious moments than explaining what slavery and its legacy was all about.<br/><br/>
Similarly, screenwriter John Ridley, may have been attracted to the story in order to draw a parallel between what he perceives as modern day racism and the horrors of the past. Of course equating slavery with the ""racism"" of today is absurd as the physical subjugation of African-Americans was eliminated following President Lincoln's ""Emancipation Proclamation"" and codified into law with the 14th Amendment. Nonetheless, a story such as Northrup's, can still be used by writers like Ridley to intimidate rather than edify.<br/><br/>
Northrup's story only focuses on the very worst aspects of slavery and for its time makes sense. But there is little sense here of the black man's triumph IN SPITE of the degradations they had to endure. The positive message (which reverberates today, for example, in many black churches) but is ignored in this film, leaves one wondering if Ridley's screenplay is designed more as agitprop than art.<br/><br/>
The flip side of the coin is the deleterious effect the legacy of slavery had on the psyche of African-Americans throughout the years. Is it more important to make a movie simply about the horrors of slavery without discussing the effects of its legacy?<br/><br/>
Despite these concerns as to the questionable motivations of the director and his screenwriter, in a limited sense, Northrup's story still features powerful moments which begin with the family man/musician's abduction by slave traders in 1841 Saratoga, NY. The break into the Second Act, which constitutes the beginning of Northrup's nightmare, is when he's sold into slavery down in New Orleans. The scene is doubly horrifying as Northrup witnesses the separation of two children from their mother, who are all sold into slavery.<br/><br/>
The first half of Act II features heightening tension as Northrup is sold to a relatively kind but ineffectual plantation owner, William Ford, who treats him decently and even gives him a violin as a present. Ford recognizes that Northrup is educated (without questioning where he got his education) and allows him to assist in engineering a waterway for transporting logs downstream.<br/><br/>
Nonetheless, Ford is unable to prevent the plantation overseer, the brutal racist Tibeats, from severely beating Northrup, who is almost lynched but prevented by the head overseer, who is afraid that Ford will lose his original $400 investment. Although Ford is the owner, Tibeats is really in control and settles on selling Northrup to another plantation owner, the even more brutal Edwin Epps.<br/><br/>
Epps is a religious fundamentalist who reads Bible passages to his slaves but also beats them whenever he's in the mood. He's also a hypocrite, as he's sexually infatuated with a young slave, Patsey, whom he rapes and will not stop, despite his wife's constant entreaties. The jealous wife takes out all her hatred on poor Patsey too; in one powerful scene, she offers treats to all the slaves, except Patsey, who she strikes in the head in front of her husband, and a horrified Northrup and his fellow slaves.<br/><br/>
Northrup's deliverance occurs in Act III when he meets a white man, Bass, a carpenter, who's doing a job for Epps and has abolitionist sentiments. Northrup is reluctant to tell Bass his story since earlier he was betrayed by a white worker on the plantation, after he attempts to convince the man to mail a letter for him, to alert his family and friends in New York. Northrup finally decides to trust Bass and things are set in motion, which leads to his freedom. Brad Pitt might not have been the best casting choice here but his character Bass's intervention proves to be one of the few positive moments in this very dour tale.<br/><br/>
Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent in the role of Northrup as he echoes the original author's restrained dignity. In one sense, McQueen and Ridley should be praised for resurrecting this ""historical artifact."" On the other hand, the narrative is limited and ignores both the positive and negative effect the legacy of slavery had on the descendants of its victims.<br/><br/>
Instead, this antediluvian tale brings little or nothing positive to the modern-day debate about race relations wherein the ""sins of the fathers"" may be deemed morally equivalent by some misguided individuals, to what's going on today."

","This movie does not break new ground. The subject has been brought up many times and each time the premises is the same. The dark side of America at one time and how mans inhumanity to man reaches down into the soul past conscience and for some leads to salvation for others damnation. It is not a pretty site to see men mistreating men. Nature can do it, acts of God take place and accidents will happen. To see mankind mistreat mankind deliberately and without cause recalls the very history of the human race into question and it isn't pretty. What throws a type of Holy water on it is that Christianity is seen supporting this questionable behavior by men who are oblivious to their own hypocrisy as they make the scriptures come alive in their favor. But America is made up of these little pockets of history and mishap which at some point leads to liberty and justice for all. But for those who had to endure the journey from the learning curve perspective, it remains brutal and it testifies that we all need salvation from one thing or another. Those that stood by remain guilty as those who carried on. I like this movie because it gets to the point and the point is where you have to go the sooner the better. I am also reminded that ignorance if allowed to travel uncorrected recruits its like kind. Bravo to the acting, directing and story line which is nothing less than one mans testimony of his life. His story captures but a small portion because who can learn to speak and write Hell fluently? Grab something to eat before you watch, have some popcorn and snack during the film to keep your nails away from your mouth and a tasty drink to wash it all down with...BTW...I am a man who has a good grasp on his emotions, but this film wrestled with me 3 times and won as evidenced by my tears...."
"ahmed_fm2003","7","4","17","7 November 2013"," Good movie BUT.....
","I thing the best way to be fair about this movie is to write Pros and Cons. Pros: great acting, beautiful soundtrack, gives you a chance to appreciate life and a look back to history. Its touching and emotional. Cons: I usually love to go to the movies to enjoy a nice romance-comedy or action, so i am not used on such type of movies to be honest. So i found it a little bit sad, bloody story with sometimes excagerated violence details. So if you are looking for a refreshing break from work and life (as i usually do when i go to the movies), see another thing. Overall, I think its a movie worth watching, but may be on DVD when it gets released is enough for me."
"bscale","6","1","2","30 April 2020"," Uncomfortable to watch and unnecessary depress
","Weird direction of bio-pic film, I guess the director wanted us to feel the pain of them. I don't find the ending sinks in my heart. I felt numb and nothingness.<br/><br/>Anyway it's such a weird experience from this film. Some scenes are quite nice."

"skepticskeptical","8","1","2","21 December 2019"," Terribly Important
","There have been a number of very good films made about life in pre-abolition America (The Color Purple, et al). What makes 12 Years a Slave important is that it offers a perspective seldom revealed in historical movies on the topic of slavery in the United States: the truly Kafkaesque quality of life for people in danger of being thrust back into servitude at the caprice of mercenary criminals.<br/><br/>Most good films about the Holocaust manage to convey the surreal insanity of that period of history, where people were confounded at every turn by a bureaucracy and law system which designated some persons as nonpersons. In 12 Years a Slave, this very dynamic is at last brought to light in the story of a free black man who is kidnapped and forced into slavery for twelve years, while his family wondered up north where he had gone.<br/><br/>Some disgruntled reviewers have complained that every single black person enslaved was a free person wrongly enslaved, which is true, but the unique perspective here is that even black persons themselves were living their lives Up North while millions of persons were being abused Down South. The emphasis here is on the horrible plight of the slaves, but this film also reveals truths about the complacency of all persons going about their lives during this period, whether black or white, who were not at the time actively engaged in the abolition movement.<br/><br/>Some may find the film too violent and the depiction of white people too negative, but 12 Years a Slave offers an incisive perspective on what happened to all persons wronged during this period of US history. I recommend it for educational, not entertainment, purposes."

","My Rating : 8/10<br/><br/>Based on a true story, '12 Years a Slave' is superbly acted, paced and photographed - it has a brilliant cast - it goes deep into where one does not want to go; it's a difficult and shameful period in human history where human dignity has been stripped off like the whipping of innocent lives.<br/><br/>I recently revisited the film and it moved me to tears and also angered me. A chapter of history that is a disgrace to humanity."

"andrewroy-04316","10","1","2","13 August 2018"," With an amazing cast and brutally accurate scenes, 12 Years a Slave is impeccable
","12 Years a Slave completely blew me away. Every element of the film is very well done, and I was deeply immersed in Solomon's perspective. The first thing that jumps out is the cast - one of the great all-time casts, with each giving a great performance, particularly Ejiofor, Nyongo, and Fassbender. Ejiofor really connects emotionally with the viewer and his changes as slavery wears on him were visible and devastating. What elevates this movie to another level is McQueen's direction - he clearly shows how slavery is a complex, ingrained structure and the he keeps you immersed in Solomon's life nonstop. While some were bothered by the lack of mention of time passing, I think it reinforces the idea that it feels like it will never end and keeps the viewer dialed in. The brutality of slavery was very evident. Zimmer's score, as always, added to the scene progressions. Between the excellent technical elements and the searing depiction of slavery, this is an all-time great."
"monkeylion-41176","3","1","2","19 July 2018"," A powerful story, a bad movie.
","Everyone should read Solomon Northup's memoir. It is a powerful, moving, and culturally important tale of the injustice of slavery.<br/><br/>This movie, however, seemed to be a poor attempt to turn that story into quick cash. Characters were not developed, scenes were stitched together in an odd way, and the ending was rushed and didn't seem to convey the intense emotions Solomon had in being rescued.<br/><br/>I understand a movie can only do so much, but I'm not sure how a viewer who has not read the memoir would be able to get much from the movie. And those who have read it will be disappointed at lost opportunities to convey the true horror of the situation and total exclusion of some important anecdotes (particularly the continued menace of Tibeats)"
"john_siv","6","1","2","12 February 2018"," Decent biopic, but definitely not a classic
","This was a good biopic and apparently faithful to the source material, which is to its credit.<br/><br/>However one can't read the over-abundance of gushing praise this has received from the professionals without getting just a whiff of politics and insincerity.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, but not a great one. Not one I'll remember much from in 5 years from now, for that matter. Good performances and some intense scenes, but just not enough there to call it a classic or anything.<br/><br/>Not enough work was done on Solomon's character prior to his enslavement. Just an additional 3-4 minutes or so of showing his personality whilst living his normal family life would have gone a long way towards building more sympathy throughout the picture. As it happens his character was bland and underdeveloped. Whatever 'groundbreaking' or 'daring' type of story you're trying to tell, the basics of storytelling still apply; in this instance, that's routine character-building.<br/><br/>The constant excess of the evil-doing of the slave-owners was too much. Of course some will say that's the point of the movie, but the point was more than well made. At times this veered into the realms of torture porn and that's not what I go to the movies for.<br/><br/>There were too many lingering shots of Solomon and/or the surrounding scenery during this movie. One or two would have been acceptable, but it literally felt like 2-3 minutes could have been trimmed off the film by dispensing with some of this overly-indulgent cinematography. Did I really need to see the poor fellow hanging from a tree for as long as I did? The point was already well made.<br/><br/>Whenever I watch a film, I like to ponder why it was made. This film clearly wasn't made to tell an interesting story, as it really wasn't that intriguing a plot. Man gets sold into slavery and gets out 12 years later after sending a letter. I can only deduce that the film was made to faithfully present a biopic, to drive home the horrors of slavery and, far worse, to attempt to make white folk feel a sense of shame for their history. <br/><br/>I can always appreciate a good biopic but do we really, in the 21st century, need a reminder of the injustices of slavery? That is a portion of history that everyone is well aware of, regrets and never wants to see a return of. If the filmmakers wanted white folk to feel ashamed of their history, as I strongly suspect they did, then that is an appalling and insulting reason to make a movie. And it's a form of exploitation that absolutely should not be rewarded with a Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>I feel shame when I think of the gross injustice of slavery and the millions of lives it's ruined, but I don't want or need a film to reinforce that for two long, gory hours. I don't want or need a movie to tell me how to think or feel; such is the social justice warrior world of the 21st century that we live in that filmmakers now seem to see that as one of their basic rights."

","Steve McQueen nailed this film with excellent directing and editing. This film is one of my favorite slave-era films and the fact it's based on a true story, makes it even more satisfying.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of this genre, and when I heard Brad Pitt was in this type of film, I though 'flop', but I was wrong.<br/><br/>This film was intense, and the story was executed very well.

It is a cruel film with the spectator and will make you suffer practically from beginning to end, leaving you discredited by seeing so much barbarism being made by the human being, but at the same time hypnotizes you with so much beauty in the frames, the lighting and the outstanding performances of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender, is certainly one of the best films of this decade and for me the best in portraying slavery, it is surely a must see for anyone who likes cinema."
"areatw","8","1","2","6 June 2016"," Very good, but maybe a little overrated
","'12 Years a Slave' is a very powerful and moving film based on the true story of a black man sold into slavery. It was excellently received by critics and audiences alike when it was first released so I was really looking forward to seeing it for the first time when it premiered on British TV this weekend.<br/><br/>There's no doubt about it, this is a very good film. Even with the highly irritating advert breaks every 15 minutes it was easy to become emotionally involved in the storyline. However, I must admit that I didn't think it was as good as many have suggested and there were parts of the film that I thought could have been better executed. In particular, I thought the scenes of violence were unnecessarily long. The audience can easily grasp what is happening without the need for prolonged scenes of brutal beatings that almost force emotions on you.<br/><br/>Overall, '12 Years a Slave' is undeniably a powerful film that does a good job at telling a very difficult story. I thought it was well written and acted and I can understand the reasons behind the glowing reviews. A very good film, but I was expecting more to be honest."

","12 Years a Slave tells a tragic story of a Free black man, Solomon Northrup, from upstate NY with a family and musical talent. On a trip to Washington DC, he gets kidnapped by slave traders and dragged into slavery.<br/><br/>Americans know the sad history of slavery in the US. This film slaps you in the face with visceral storytelling of the brutality and abuse of slavery, both mental and physical. Some made it, mostly by keeping quiet and acting like docile pets to cruel masters. Others did not.<br/><br/>You will see images of terrible lashings, whips, chains, sexual destruction, hangings, the whole thing. Over and over, this misery bludgeons you into hopelessness. While I'm sure the director expressed all this misery repeatedly to wear the viewer down, after 2 hrs 14 minutes, I had had enough - I got the point. There were too many long scenes, and repeated scenes like the dancing, and the abuse of the poor attractive black girl, and of Northrup himself of course. <br/><br/>Maybe that is what the director intended, and if so, he did a terrific job. This movie is not for the faint of heart. If you want an in-your- face reality check on just what slavery was, and perhaps why still today there is a growing animosity from blacks against whites, see 12 Years a Slave. It's not a masterpiece, and I'm sure it was a difficult film for the actors to make, but it is a story that bears your seeing to experience this horrible piece of history that we hope never happens again.<br/><br/>Terrific acting throughout, with my major critique being the length.

Some of these rulings involve convictions for 'selling spirits to a slave', slave owners who have died and ownership of slaves are in question, and there is a troubling ruling on a child slave who died after being punished for running away.. the child was purchased by another slave owner and died before ownership was taken over and the purchaser wants his money back.

"tomsview","9","1","2","16 June 2015"," Lashes the soul
","This is one of those films that leave you sitting in your theatre seat long after the curtains close and the lights go up.<br/><br/>To say it has impact is an understatement.<br/><br/>Set in Pre-Civil War America, it's the story of a free African American man, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), from New York who is kidnapped and forced into slavery in the South. He is held for 12 harrowing years before regaining his freedom.<br/><br/>The things he endures and sees makes this a horror story; more shocking than any with a supernatural theme because it's true. And there's the thing, one could shield oneself from the effects of this movie if you discovered it was simply a filmmaker's exaggeration of a less sensational piece of history.<br/><br/>However that isn't the case, it's actually very faithful to the book Northup wrote about his experiences, substantiated in large part by other sources. The things we see happen to Northup happened; the things we see happen to Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) really happened (only they were probably worse), and there really was an Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) and his wife (Sarah Paulson).<br/><br/>As a piece of filmmaking it is hard to fault this one, and it deserves all its awards. The time and the period are caught beautifully and in many ways, the camera acts as a dispassionate observer. Hans Zimmer's score also captures a sense of the sad inevitability of it all as the tragedy unfolds.<br/><br/>We have seen slavery from this period depicted before, but this film brings home how entwined the lives of the slaves and their white masters were – there is no sense of separation of the whites in their mansion houses from the hundreds of slaves working in the fields and living in their ramshackle quarters. The plantations shown in the film seem smaller with fewer slaves, and the two groups seem to live cheek by jowl; they know each other well. <br/><br/>This is a film that will stay with me. Although it shows that not all the slave owners were cruel, ""12 Years a Slave"" demonstrates the truth of the old maxim that while power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely."

He had to experience a few harsh ""masters"", one of whom made them dance in the middle of the night while drunk even though a long day of work laid ahead.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful and honest movie, even made more so by Lupita Nyong'o's riveting performance as a tortured slave who comes to believe that death is more welcoming than life.

","There is not much I can really say about this movie. This is one of very few films that leaves me feeling neutral. The acting is very impressive throughout. However, even great acting can't save a movie from a faulty plot. The movie has a very narrow range of intensity. In order to excite, a movie needs to go from 0 to 100 and then back to 0 quickly, and repeatedly. This movie starts out at a good 30 and eventually gets to about 60. C'mon guys, its a slave movie; if you think whipping is going to feel intense in that context, you are mistaken. Overall, the whole film is predictable, even the resolution. All that said, I can move beyond that and get through it without feeling as if the time was truly wasted. The only intense criticism I have stems from a brief sex scene at the beginning. After reading up on the basis of this movie, I found that Northup's autobiography no where states that he violated his marriage by having sex with another slave. This modification, supposedly warranted by ""artistic license"", just feels like a cheap and distasteful stab at Northup's legacy, though probably not intentionally. Again, some really great acting, but nothing too special about the movie as a whole."
"jacobpatanellcc16","10","1","2","4 January 2015"," It was a great film, but...
","This movie was a great 134 minutes of my life, but it's tough to say that because of the topic of the movie which is slavery, and the graphic violence of the slaves getting whipped and almost hung to death. It's just amazing to think that with the treatment that Solomon or Platt went through for 12 years and separated from his family at the kidnapping and still fought through it for so long to get freed. The amount of courage that it takes and will to live to just take 100 lashes a week and basically be bullied severely every day for being black for 12 years is astounding, most of us don't have it. Overall, a great film, 2 thumbs up!"
"androgineus","9","1","2","18 August 2014"," Slavery is not yet annulled
","12 years a slave is a film adaptation of an autobiography by Solomon Northup, a freeborn African American, who was abducted and spent 12 years in slavery, working on plantations, before being set free. This a third feature film by director Steve McQueen after his much appraised Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011). All of them feature actor Michael Fassbender, who here appears in the role of one of the meanest characters in film history, that could be best compared to Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the plantation owner Calvin Candie in Tarantino's Django Unchained. Brad Pit's production company Plan B Entertainment supported the making of this film and he himself shortly appears as the person who helps Solomon to regain his freedom. Being based on a story of a firsthand experience, this film is one of the best films tackling the subject of slavery putting the cruelties of of those who have power over other people straight to our faces and bringing closer to our understanding the facts of the slaves' sufferings. The cast gives a brilliant performance, starting with Chiwetel Ejiofor in the role of Solomon, to whom an injustice has been done and is held captive as a slave on a plantation. He tries to attain some level of dignity in the given conditions, but all the things he survives during his slavery and all the things he sees that other slaves are subjected to, all the humiliation, leave him a broken men with traumas he won't be able to get over to the end of his life. Chiwetel Ejiofor very often manages to convey the character's emotions only through a face expression, almost like a silent movie actor. Michael Fassbender is also excellent in the role of the decadent cruel plantation owner Edwin Epps. He seems to be the sum of all evils in one, he is merciless, an alcoholic and an adulterer. He whips his slaves after they have spent all day picking cotton, if they have not picked the satisfactory weight, he wakes them at night and forces them to dance for his sheer amusement, but the worst of all is his relationship to Patsey (Lupita Myong'o), his favorite slave, or the queen of the fields, as he calls her. He is not an immune to the attraction to a black girl, and as his guilty conscience of being involved with, in his opinion, a lower kind of human, starts to torment him, he vents his fury by lashing her to exhaustion. This film is daring in representing Christianity as a tool for justifying slavery as depicted in the sermons read to the slaves by Epps and Master Ford (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). Although primarily a good man and a Christian, Ford does not let ""sentimentality"" overcome him and in his blindness he continues to abide to social settings. Paul Dano is always good playing the bad guy (since There will be Blood – 2007), in the role of the carpenter Tibeats, who is enraged by the fact that a slave can be smarter than him and who provokes Solomon's only attempt for resistance. And there is one more performance worthy of notice and that's of Alfre Woodard, playing Mistress Shaw. She portrays a former slave elevated to the rank of Mistress, by being the Master's object of affections. She resents her past life as a slave and enjoys all the luxuries of being a Mistress, even that of being served. Sound plays a great role in 12 years a slave, starting from the scene in which the slaves are being shipped to New Orleans, where the sound imitates a steamboat siren. Later we will hear this sound again in the scene where an attempt has been made by Tibeast to lynch Solomon, and the tension when he hangs on the rope standing tiptoe is intensified to unbearableness by the pitching sound of crickets. This film is even more valid today since the consequences of the slavery in America can be still felt and slavery in the world has not yet been annulled. Maybe it doesn't have the same form as then but it is present even in the so called democratic countries in the capitalist profiteers' treatment of their employees, who like the slaves have no right to speak up against injustice."
"DarylKMiddlebrook","9","1","2","12 August 2014"," A Film That Vividly Displays The Inhumanity of American Slavery
","I hesitated going to see this film because I couldn't wrap my mind around watching another slave film where there's that white character who is so understanding of the African slaves plight. I just couldn't fathom watching another film where there's that sadistic, over-acting white master, who it's so obvious we're suppose to hate that we cheer when he gets his in the end. I definitely didn't want to be subjected to that well-known sympathetic white wife or child, who battled his own soul to balance the Ol' South's tradition of slavery as opposed to its evil against mankind. Finally, I didn't want to see another Django Unchained, which, I'm well aware, many people found enjoyable. However, for me, Quentin Tarentino's grindhouse Blaxploitation rip-off left a bitter taste in my mouth, as I felt he dealt with slavery in an almost whimsical, comical manner. As an African American, I found this appalling since White America has never apologized, given restitution, nor accepted it's role in one of the most-inhumane periods in human history.<br/><br/>However, this is a film review, not a history lesson, so first off, let me say that 12 Years a Slave IS NOTHING LIKE DJANGO UNCHAINED! They are two different movies, two different genres, and two different directors. 12 years A Slave is the horrific journey of Solomon Northup, a black man born free who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. What transpires is one man's visual diary of the atrocity, hypocrisy and inhumane world of Southern American slavery. There are no heroes, no melodramatic Hollywood moments, only a man trying to find his way back home to his family. <br/><br/>What sets this film apart in my opinion, are the magnificent performances of its cast, in particular, Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ms. Lupita Nyong'o. Where there are no over-emotional moments, no grand Hollywood speeches to the white master, these two actors succeed in taking us back in time, and drawing us into the character's lives and pain. Ejiofor's Solomon Northrup tells us his internal pain with his eyes, as they seek out justice, but find only despair. His words are few, but when spoken, they convey his slipping grasp on his former freedom, something he will not, can not let go of, throughout his living nightmare. <br/><br/>Rising up with the same breathtaking performance is talented newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, who portrayal of Patsey is the counter opposite of Ejiofor's Solomon. Patsey has known nothing but slavery; her life consists of survival, doing what's necessary to keep the lash from her back. However, even that's not good enough, as she must also contend with the lust of her master, and the hatred of his wife and her mistress. Through Nyong'o performance, we're aware of Patsey's troubling slow-death. Hers is the coupling that connects the two worlds of the Negro in America. Solomon, born free, educated, providing for his family, and Patsey, uneducated, a workhorse who's known nothing but hard labor and the lust of her perverted master. Two separate lives, two separate existences, bound together because of one skin color.<br/><br/>Two significant scenes standout, the first being Solomon, after having been drugged, wakes up in a basement, chained to the floor. It's dark, we don't see much, but we hear the chains scraping against the concrete. Our heart's race as we realize that something dreadful has happened to this carefree violinist. The second haunting scene takes place after Solomon has a major setback in his attempt for freedom. Solomon stares out into space. There is no music for dramatic effect. We just watch for about thirty seconds, the face of a man whose faith has been totally washed away. <br/><br/>Accolades to director Steve McQueen for taking on a challenge he must have known would draw both critical and negative attention. McQueen succeeds in telling the story of Solomon Northrup and the horrors of slavery, without ""telling us"" the story. Whereas many directors must put their ""stamp"" on their work, McQueen allows us to graze through the scenery, the imagery and the emotions without force-feeding us. Letting us absorb the horrors the character's face on our own. I have to mention the excellent screenplay written by John Ridley, which garnered him a much-deserved Oscar. Also on point was Sean Bobbitt's cinematography, which creates a breathtaking painting of nineteenth century America."
"nicola-orofino","7","1","2","10 June 2014"," The worst title for a movie
","I understand that the original title is from a book on which the film is based, but it is one thing to read a book called ""12 years a slave"", another to watch a movie: you do not enjoy, nor the beginning, because you already know that will be captured, nor the middle, because you already know that will be released, nor the end, because you would expect from the entire movie. In practice, two and half hours of film ruined by a very wrong way. Then it is no true that the film has made me so enthusiastic. It seems built for very captatio benevolentiae, without much skill on the part of the director and screenwriter. The audience becomes attached to the protagonist, but can not forget the thousands of other slaves who were not already ""free men"" and therefore will never come to be. It has been chosen to tell the story from a heartbreaking point of view, too much personal; if that's okay for an autobiographical book, not the same can be said for a film nominated for an Oscar. The only ten minutes by Oscar are those in which he starred Brad Pitt; I also believe are the ten minutes the most interesting of the whole movie. For the rest, a recommended viewing, sure, but not a masterpiece."
"shaunridge1993","10","1","2","23 February 2014"," A detailed and historic tale of something that is very rarely discussed.
","I'd like to begin this review by stating that 12 Years A Slave is a film that is supposed to be analysed, watched carefully and witnessed rather than simply beheld. It educates the viewer on the horrific past of slavery during the 1840's in the Southern States. Many of the scenes were filmed with McQueen's particular direction and cinematography to emphasise the cruelty of the entire topic.<br/><br/>During one scene, Solomon is tied up with a slipknot, whilst the camera idly watches from a distance at him struggling on his tip-toes in order to stay alive. The camera casually shows the activity of the other slaves in the background during this one-shot getting on with their work. They are so afraid of their 'masters' that they can do nothing to help. This particular scene really magnifies the extremity of which the cruelty extended to their very will and human-instinct. <br/><br/>Following other successful slave films such as Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave is much more faithful to the details of the past, and this particular true story is like none other. This movie should not be watched for pleasure, but simply because it should just be seen. With great performances all round, the viewer gets a great insight into the past, and truly reveals the horror of which some of our white ancestors committed. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I believe the atmosphere in which you watch this film will determine how much you gain from the experience. I would recommend watching this alone, with a great deal of concentration, and a considerate and empathetic heart at the ready.<br/><br/>10/10"
"billcr12","8","1","2","22 February 2014"," Devastating
","Solomon Northrup was a man living in upstate New York in 1841 who was abducted by slave traders and brought south to work on various plantations. Chiwetel Ejiofor is spectacular in the lead role and deserving of an Oscar for best actor. The whippings and horrible conditions of the slaves is almost too much to watch. This is a long and draining experience for the entire two hours and fifteen minute running time. The entire cast is exceptional but be prepared to be emotionally exhausted in the end. Director McQueen has a keen eye for detail but sometimes lingers a bit longer then necessary at times. His previous efforts, Hunger and Shame were guilty of similar excesses. Overall, 12 Years a Slave is McQueen's best film."

It was midnight, I got up and looked at Facebook, then bits and pieces, I had 12 Years a Slave, it has moved me forward, as if pushed me from behind and slapped me in the face. Now it is morning, I started the film near midnight, alone, it held me like speaking right into me, I was not afraid of the self confrontation as the clock passed 0100am, I really engaged in a way that I could not have known. Now I have learnt and experienced and want to make more of me for my daughter who is 9. Slavery and exploitation are written into capitalism now, it is perhaps worth meditating on that. This is not a film, it is a testament to life as we all seek enlightenment."
"dndcullens","8","1","2","26 January 2014"," Good movie
","Having watched DJANGO UNCHAINED and LINCOLN, I was interested to see another film on slavery and like the two mentioned it did not disappoint. For most sane people the idea of slavery or a Holocaust is something unfathomable and the rational behind such horrors is something that should be included in any movie on such subjects. It isn't enough just showing slavery or the persecution of certain people there has to be a reason (albeit a stupid reason at best) as to why this is happening. Leaving aside the horrors of the Holocaust as that is death with elsewhere, slavery is one of those things which seems almost like an act of stupidy. Now there are no doubt reasons why such things happened and apparently it is also sanctioned in the bible but when you look at it you think to yourself what the hell is this happening. So it was that slavery happened for whatever reason and a civil war had to be fought to end it. Those that argue about states rights and the rest are totally missing the point that the civil war WAS fought because a President was elected on a no slavery ticket. So when it comes to movies about slavery the reasons for it are not properly explained. Nor are the plight of the slaves. The slaves were latterly treated like dogs. Sure you have a dog you like, sure some treat their dogs nice but in the end if they are no use to you or they cause trouble or get sick you get rid of 'em. And so in this case you get a man who was free suddenly thrown into a place where he didn't even have a voice and where death was just an insult away. In that way the movie strikes a cord and shows us all the arguments we would use to get out of such a situation to be useless. A really good movie and some excellent performances."
"NannonHarry","8","1","2","24 January 2014"," Vital
","12 Years a Slave may lack the unique boldness of Steve McQueen's previous films but it's still not the filmmaking you'd expect for such a biopic. From start to finish, the film borders on art house cinema and period flick. But McQueen's signature long takes are what reinforces the horror behind this particular part of history which Hollywood had once shunned away from for so long.<br/><br/>The film certainly doesn't shy away from the raw suffering and realism of the narrative with gruesome shots of the slaves open wounds and scars. One of the most memorable yet hard to watch scenes comes in the form of an agonising and never-ending wide shot of Northup's punishment of being forced to hang by the neck from a tree. Blatant evil and helplessness of an individual is spoken while children play in the background and other slaves turn a blind eye while Northup is on the brink of suffocation.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor shines as lead character Solomon Northup with a moving performance worthy of his many award wins and nominations. Michael Fassbender gives depth to his sadistic, self-loathing villain Edward Epps. You'll be on the edge of your seats whenever these actors share the screen. <br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o is a perfect example of the supporting cast standing out from the crowd. Nyong'o showcases one of the finest feature film debuts to date with her character Patsey. A brilliant Sarah Paulson encourages the biggest gasps and hisses from the audience. The most underrated performance definitely goes to Paul Dano - even though his character only appears in a select number of scenes during the films first hour - who is on remarkable form.<br/><br/>The films sound design is also an instant masterpiece. The amplified cracking of a whip will make your heart skip a beat while the soothing natural sounds of the plantations mixed with the slaves' songs provide enough emotion to make you wince. However, Hans Zimmer's score doesn't quite have the impact as expected.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen paints a vital and heartbreaking portrait of a shameful historic truth. 12 Years a Slave feels like a powerful history lesson told by some of the most genuine performances you will ever see from an immensely talented cast."
"evan_harvey","8","1","2","22 January 2014"," A great film
","I don't know whether 12 Years a Slave does anything more to shed light on the history of American slavery, but it's a well-made film. The acting is all top-notch, and the cinematography is great.<br/><br/>It's a film that deserves to be seen because it presents an honest (presumably) view of what slavery was like in the US. It has a few brutal scenes that will make people squeamish, but they're not gratuitous.<br/><br/>Some people have complained that the film doesn't present a perfect snapshot of slavery, and this is true. By all accounts there were, for example, many runaway slaves, and a noble legacy of resistance to slavery by slaves themselves. However, that's an argument that is unfair to both the filmmakers and Solomon Northup himself. Solomon chose to endure and try and survive, and to fault him for that is not right. That there were many developments in terms of slaves escaping, and resisting slavery, and no film can truly cover every aspect of a given historical time. The film is Solomon's story, and should be appreciated on those terms.<br/><br/>A great film, and a great story that needs to be seen, if only to gain a little understanding of the horrors that we do to ourselves."
"olastensson13","7","1","2","25 December 2013"," Dark history
","It's not part of a new trend, like some people say. The breakthrough for filming US slavery history was ""Roots"" in the 70s, but not even that was the first time. Fashion comes and fashion goes and that's the case also with subjects from the past.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen's film has got very good reviews and is destined to get many Oscars. But despite the brutal subject, the script is so traditional. McQueen sometimes uses long takes, he dares to let the camera focus on actors' faces for long, but the characters are all without complication. Like the audiences have to be underestimated.<br/><br/>Not that we don't need history lessons and sometimes in the film, there's a discussion embryo about owner's right in general. But not more than audiences are supposed to take."
"Dan_L","10","2","7","4 February 2014"," Most Important -- and Perhaps Best - Film of 2013
","It's one thing to have studied slavery way back when in college and another thing to see it so accurately portrayed on the silver screen. ""12 Years a Slave"" was certainly the most important movie of 2013 and the most difficult to watch film in decades thanks to its spot-on depiction of the horrors of slavery in the American South. Unlike slavery in South America, it was illegal in the U.S. to teach slaves reading or writing, they could not marry, they could not gather in groups except for religious services, they could not own anything, and they were nothing more than chattel. Manumission was generally impossible. The brilliant acting, directly, and writing of ""12 Years a Slave"" brought this all to life. It is impossible to watch this film and not ask how we could allow the South back into the Union without executing its leaders for treason and how we cannot allow the flag of the rebels, the Confederacy to be flown within our borders. I can't think of any other nation on earth that was so forgiving to those who engaged in high treason and rebellion.<br/><br/>That said, the acting was simply top notch. And the script -- there are not adequate words to praise the script enough. I was amazed at how the actors spoke in the manner of the day and never slipped into current styles of speech. You don't see that very often. While I think the film deserves the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Screen writing, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actress, I strongly suspect that like ""The Color Purple"" before it, the Academy will shut it out because we Caucasian folk just cannot deal with this stain on our nation. It would be a shame because this is a film that all Americans should see, especially those radical right wingers who continue to deny the horrors of American slavery."

It was a fantastic movie although, as expected, very difficult to watch. One very impressive aspect was the different layers it brought out. Someone was really on top of their game! What an amazing movie effort for all involved.<br/><br/>I think that African-Americans will definitely see this movie in an entirely different context from others. As I watched in the theater I noticed people kept getting up and then returning. I wondered if it was a ""nature break"" or if some of scenes were a bit too intense. Either way, this movie is not to be missed."
"bill_the_butcher7","10","2","7","1 January 2014"," '12 Years a Slave' Is Hauntingly Beautiful
","In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Given a new name of 'Platt', Solomon is beaten by anyone whom he told he was free. For twelve years, Solomon faces immense cruelty, such as from slave-owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), and struggles to keep hope, dignity, and his life.<br/><br/>Hollywood doesn't show many films on slavery often, yet we have managed to have two big ones in the last two years: Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained and now Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave. Django, last year's bloody southern-western, sets slavery as the backdrop with a fantastical narrative that features plenty of revenge and entertainment while still dealing with the dark time period. Slave, on the other hand, grabs your head and holds it toward the screen— forcing you to acknowledge the horrors of our past.<br/><br/>Slave is an emotionally exhausting experience due to the fact that McQueen never dares to let up behind the camera. He and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt frame each shot beautifully amidst the ugly actions in the scenes. McQueen's close-ups of Solomon—either singing, crying, or thinking —are immensely powerful visuals of a man who in his current situation has no power. In one heart rendering scene involving Epps forcing Solomon to whip a fellow slave, McQueen films it in one breathtaking continuous shot making the audience see every emotion on each actor's face uninterrupted.<br/><br/>The performances in Slave are all exemplary with standouts Ejiofor and Fassbender emitting such intensity in every scene. Fassbender makes Epps a man of true evil; he sees his slaves as ""his propertyno better than a dog."" He erupts into anger and violence at the drop of his hat, and his wife (Sarah Paulson) is just as masochistic as he is. Ejiofor is devastating as Solomon; the scenes where he is silent and alone are some of most commanding ones in all the film. He is changed from a loving family man into a beaten soul, but his eyes never lose the hope to once again be free.<br/><br/>Slave may be a harrowing experience, but it is an absolute crucial must-see. Not since Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List twenty years ago has a film shown history in such a haunting and unforgettable way. This film, while very brutal, is an incredible story of human spirit when it, as Solomon says, doesn't want to survive, but live."

I also didn't feel his family showed him enough compassion at the end so that seemed really unrealistic and sad."

","Acclaimed director Steve McQueen (Shame, Hunger) and writer John Ridley's depressingly fascinating adaptation of Solomon Northup's autobiography ""12 Years a Slave"", just as the title suggests, tells the story of a free man (Northup) who in 1841 was abducted, sold into slavery and would spend the next twelve years of his life as a slave.<br/><br/>As one would imagine, a lot of the imagery here is hard to watch due to the subject matter. So, aside from McQueen's habit of coaxing excellent performances from his actors, if you know McQueen's work, then you know that he loves his long takes; with intent always looking towards forcing audiences to gaze upon his subject(s) unblinkingly. Anyway, in this film he focuses the majority of his long takes on sequences of the most upsetting aspects of slavery.<br/><br/>But even more visually heartbreaking, and this is almost totally due to a powerhouse performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor (who plays Northup) is watching Northup's spirit slowly break, as he comes to the realization that with each passing moment the likelihood of him regaining his freedom becomes less and less of a reality.<br/><br/>What truly sets this film apart as one of the year's best, is both a script (which not only blueprints a realistic view of everyday life on a plantation, but also contains intriguing commentary on everything from the justifications for slavery found in Bible verses, to the fact that the moral values of plantation owners differed from man to man) and a cornucopia of incredible performances. In fact, ""12 Years a Slave"" is one that should be up for tons of awards; assuredly nominations for Ejiofor and co-stars Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o (and even though she will be forgotten in this ensemble, the great actress Adepero Oduye's performance should be noted as well) and hopefully an Oscar win for Ridley and his masterful screenplay.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Yes, if you're looking to see Django Unchained 2, ""12 Years a Slave"" (while still containing strong violence and brutality that will make you squirm in your seat) may be too meditative for your liking. And yes, if it wasn't for the title, the timeline in this movie would have been extremely unclear. And yes, from the looks of it, Brad Pitt will never change his hair style no matter what the role. But even at its most preachy, even at its most deliberately paced moments and even if Pitt's accent is distractingly similar to the one he used in ""The Counselor"" and ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""12 Years a Slave"" is still one of the most profoundly compelling movies to come out of 2013 and a must see for all of those poor misguided moviegoers who thought ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" was a brave piece of African American cinema."

","""12 Years a Slave"" is one of the favorite movies. I think it makes us think about discrimination both at that time and today. I knew black people worked in plantations as slaves, but this movie told me more about that serious situation. In each scene it was easy to understand their real life at that time. Moreover, this movie is nonfiction. I imagine if I were Solomon Northup. It's so terrible and I was sure I couldn't stand the life. He was actually a free black man, but he was kidnapped and forced to work on a plantation. Today the world still has multiple kind of discrimination from racial discrimination through sexual discrimination. It may be decreasing thanks to media coverage but will it ever end? If you watch 12 Years a Slave, you can consider our society's failing. I really recommend it."

","12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime – film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.<br/><br/>Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism. <br/><br/>Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsy - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.<br/><br/>Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet. <br/><br/>There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools. <br/><br/>All in all, if you get a chance to see 12 Years a Slave, don't miss it. Not everyone will be able to stomach it but it's an outstanding film that deserves and needs to be seen."
"lorraineesimpson","10","1","3","4 June 2016"," Great movie
","I resisted going to see this film at the cinema because, to be honest, it didn't particularly interest me. I'm not keen on Hollywood when it tries to be worthy and demonstrate a social conscience, and if I wanted to be preached at for a couple of hours I would still be a church goer. So, when the film came on TV I was a bit hesitant but there was nothing else worth watching so thought I would give it a try. So glad I did as this is a very good film which largely avoids sentiment or overstating any aspect of the disgrace that was slavery. <br/><br/>This film contains some fine acting, a great performance from the lead but also some excellent supporting performances. All Oscars were well deserved. It's a difficult subject to portray in a balanced way but I think McQueen succeeds in doing that, which makes it all the more powerful. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it."

"bryank-04844","10","1","3","22 August 2015"," '12 Years A Slave' receives my highest recommendation.
","There have been many films about slavery and the Civil War over the years. Only a couple have been good, and those have featured a big war in the storyline. But as far as a story strictly on slavery goes, the film count doesn't have a lot of marks for great movies. With the exception of Quentin Tarantino's 'Django Unchained', which was more a fantasy and revenge flick on slavery, British director Steve McQueen's '12 Years A Slave' is a phenomenal film from top to bottom, yet it's extremely rough to watch in certain parts due to the emotional content of the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor leads an all-star cast in one of the finest films in recent memory. One we won't soon forget and will discuss with friends, families, strangers, and others for months to come.<br/><br/>Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, a real life free black man who lived with his family in New York in 1841. He lived in a good neighborhood, in a good house, and was well respected in the community, whites and blacks alike. Solomon plays the violin very well and is highly educated. However, one day, a pair of white men take him to dinner and offer him a job for a few weeks for good pay. The guys drug him and Solomon wakes up in chains and is on a boat on his way to the South, particularly Louisiana, where he is sold into slavery for twelve years before his amazing rescue back to his family.<br/><br/>Northup actually wrote a book detailing his experiences as a slave and is still selling copies today. Once Solomon arrives in Louisiana, nobody will believe who he says he is and is renamed Platt by a slave trader (Paul Giamatti), who in then takes him and several other slaves to be sold. This scene is particularly rough to watch as we see Giamatti use these humans as products more than people to sell to his buyers. And when he separates children from their mothers, it particularly emotional. Several of the slaves including Northup/Platt are sold to a plantation owner named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who takes a liking to Northup's violin playing and higher education.<br/><br/>Ford actually seems like a good guy, but was put in the wrong time period and the wrong place, as he doesn't seem to enjoy the idea of slavery nor does he beat any of them. That can't be said for one of his underlings, Tibeats (Paul Dano), who is quite the opposite and enjoys punishing and abusing these slaves. He pushes Northup to far one time, which causes Northup to beat up Tibeats. And Ford fearing that Tibeats will retaliate harshly, sells Northup to cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).<br/><br/>Until now, Northup seems to be doing the best he can to stay alive and plays the helpless victim very well. But it isn't until Northup arrives on Epps plantation, to where things get even better film wise. Epps is in fact a real person and even read Northup's book. But Epps is truly an evil man, and not a one-note evil, but layers of it. Fassbender, who was the star in McQueens previous films, is indeed amazing once again here, if not on a grander scale. Epps' belief is that he can void any thought from his slaves, no matter what they might be in the form of physical harm. But he also reads scripture to his slaves on Sundays, and has them dance in his house for him. However, his marriage is constantly on the rocks with his wife (Sarah Paulson), who belittles him in front of the slaves on how he is not a real man, and how he drinks to0 much, which he does, and it doesn't bode well for anyone, especially the small slave girl named Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), who is raped repeatedly and beaten by Epps and his wife.<br/><br/>Towards the end, Epps hires a contractor to build a small gazebo on the plantation by the name of Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt), who is from Canada, and might just be the only way for Northup to escape from slavery as Bass doesn't believe in this slavery nonsense and will even argue with his employer.<br/><br/>There are many scenes of difficult watch moments, which include Northup's near death, lashings that show bone on several slaves, and brutal hangings that befall some poor individuals. The routines of the slaves is captured here and it is truly horrific. Even though this story about this particular man has a happy ending, this was not the case with most others. The outpour of emotion from the final scene as Northup looks upon his now older family and out into the open land will leave you in tears and take your breath away as Ejifor seems to go through all of his emotions with his two eyes. It's amazing.<br/><br/>The performances by everyone are at the highest level here with Ejiofor and Fassbender sticking out as the cream of the crop. For Ejiofor showing that he is never giving up and wanting to escape, but never says it, is truly remarkable. And McQueen's direction will surely earn him an Oscar nod for this is the most beautifully shot film on slavery ever made.<br/><br/>'12 Years A Slave' receives my highest recommendation."
"Desertman84","10","1","3","21 March 2015"," Provides A Brutal Look On The Evils Of Slavery
","Chiwetel Ejiofor stars in this movie entitled,""12 Years A Slave"" as Solomon Northup, a New York State citizen who was kidnapped and made to work on a plantation as a slave in New Orleans in the 1800's. It was based on his memoir that has the same title of the movie and apparently it was stated that he worked for 12 years as a slave before he was released. This movie has been honored with numerous Oscar nominations that includes the screenplay written by John Ridley and its director Steve McQueen aside from that of Best Actor for Ejiofor and winning the Best Picture during the year it was released.<br/><br/>Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, who lives with his wife, Anne Hampton, and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York.But in 1841,he was two men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him a two-week job as a musician if he will travel to Washington, D.C., with them. Once there, they drugged him and sold him as a slave to New Orleans along with others who have been captured. A slave trader named Freeman gives Northup the identity of ""Platt"", a runaway slave from Georgia and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. The movie presents the evils of slavery and the experiences Northup had in the next 12 years until he was released and regained his freedom.<br/><br/>The film won the Best Picture as stated earlier in the review.It greatly deserves this honor as it marvelously and excellently provides a brutal look at the evils of slavery during its existence in American history.Also,it was unsentimental and it clearly portrays bluntly how slavery could affect an individual.This is a powerful and compelling that one would definitely appreciate as the viewer gets to see the horrific experiences of Northup and the other slaves during the 1800's. In summary,it provides credence and great cinema translation of Northup's memoir. It is a film that viewers of great movies that would surely enjoy."
"happy_hangman","6","1","3","15 March 2015"," Great Cast
","12 Years A Slave', based upon Solomon Northup's 1853 autobiography is, as the subject matter would suggest - a freeborn black-man being kidnapped and sold into bondage as a 'Georgia Runaway - pretty grim. The underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor conveys the controlled fury of the hero as he struggles to survive in a society where he is solely considered a commodity. The only problem with the narrative - and this is something I first noticed when I first read the book, in my teens - is that many of the white characters seem like caricatures of Southern cruelty and disdain. This is, of course, an interesting inversion of the depiction of black characters in the literature of the day. It is to the credit of many of the supporting cast that they come convincingly to life. Benedict Comberbatch's Mr Ford is a study in kindness blighted by moral cowardice, and the paranoia and psychosis of Michael Fassbinder's Edwin Epps is a genuinely unsettling, and all too believable, real-life monster. A nicely understated and utterly heartbreaking performance by Lupita Nyong'o, as the molested slave Patsey, is worth the ticket price, alone. Well worth a look."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","15 September 2014"," Worth a watch for the performances and historic background
","Before I write a review, I usually make notes. Now it has been really long since I watched this movie and in my notes it says that this is likely gonna win Best Picture and possibly Best Actor (Ejiofor) and Supporting Actor (Fassbender) at the 2014 Academy Awards. And even if ""only"" Lupita Nyong'o won from the acting nominees, that should still not hurt the overall perception of this quality film. Even if I probably wouldn't put it anywhere near my top5 or probably top10, it still made for a good viewing experience.<br/><br/>Nyong'o gave a captivating performance and even if I probably would have preferred June Squibb to take it, I am pretty glad Lupita won the award as a complete newcomer to film roles in a very very close race over another very overrated performance by Jennifer Lawrence. ""12 Years a Slave"" is a biopic on a talented Black violinist who, before the Civil War, gets tricked, captivated and put into slavery. One thing I found fairly interesting was the role of the people who gave him that poisoned drink to make the physically clearly superior man unconscious and take him to his new master. As interesting as these men is Northup's state of mind and how it takes very long for him to realize what actually happened and that it was all a put-up affair.<br/><br/>There are not that many films about slavery as you may expect, so this topic was unsurprisingly right up the Academy's alley. Northup's liberation and following reunion with his family served as the emotional highlights of the movie, but did not get me as involved as I might have hoped. One thing that touched me more on an emotional level is when one of the female slaves is separated from her children as they went to a different slave owner than she did. The movie has, apart from Ejiofor, strong supporting performances from start to finish, the good, the bad and the very bad (special mention to Paul Dano).<br/><br/>This movie is particularly worth watching for the historical background as we see that, at this point in time, blacks were basically no more than cattle. And yet there were people who treated them with respect (Pitt's and Cumberbatch's characters). Also it teaches audiences some things they may not have known, for example that there were also white ""slaves"", such as the one who tries to betray Northup. One thing I did not like at all about this film, was Brad Pitt's performance. It's all so much holier-than-thou to an almost cringeworthy degree with Pitt never disappearing into character here like everybody else in the film, but just being a bit of a messiah who risks his life to save Northup's. It really made me chuckle. Shame that he got an Oscar for this, even if it was a producing Oscar as acting-wise this may very well be Pitt's most embarrassing performance so far.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I recommend watching ""12 Years a Slave"". It never starts to drag despite crossing the 2-hour-mark considerably."

","Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black family man living in Saratoga, New York. In 1841, he is lured by two men who hire him to play his violin. When they arrive in Washington, he is abducted and given the false identity of a runaway slave. He is smuggled back into the deep south to be sold to the somewhat kind William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). However he runs afoul of the jealous chief carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and Ford sells him to the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is the best cotton picker and she's constantly raped by Epps. His wife (Sarah Paulson) knows it and targets her anger on the helpless slave. It's a dangerous life and Northup must hide his identity from everyone. It's only until Canadian Bass (Brad Pitt) that he can truly rely on somebody to help him.<br/><br/>This is more than a slave movie. The fact that this is an educated man forced into slavery puts it closer to the audience. It's easier to see one's self in the Northup character in that he starts off as a regular family guy. His trials and tribulations are more compelling because of it. The performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor just reinforces that idea. He's not a superhero. He struggles. He's afraid. He's just a guy off the streets. The other performances are just as outstanding. Each one is as impressive as the next. Brad Pitt does stick out a little and I wish a smaller actor could play the part. This is the most impressive movie I've seen from Steve McQueen."

On 1841, two white men (Scoot McNairy and Taran Killam) offer him a job in the circus, but he has to travel to Washington D.C. and stay there for two weeks. Solomon takes the offer, but when they get to Washington D.C, the two men drug Solomon until he loses conscious. Solomon then wakes up trapped in chains and about to be sold into slavery; Solomon is shipped to New Orleans and renamed Platt. He is sold to different masters throughout the movie, but will he survive after the suffering he encounters?<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" takes us back to the slavery issue, and the very harsh conditions the African Americans lived in the past. It shows how the white master treated the slaves and why, and the inhumanity of one human being when treating another human being; it demonstrates the abuse and damnation of that life. This movie sends a message for us today to look at that time period differently, and to observe the past and the present very carefully to look at the future. I think that there is a message to Hollywood movie makers to stop doing fake, stupid movies about that time period, and convey the real awful picture to the world.<br/><br/>This movie is the best one to be done about slavery because there are many little details that keep us in the movie the whole time. The cast clothes are perfect and even the kitchen utilities are very accurate. Director Steve McQueen has done a great job in choosing the places for the film: the farms, old houses, trains, bars, restaurants, and barns make the spectators believe every single scene in the movie. The cast have done an excellent job in doing their parts; each character is very good, and they make us feel that those are real people and not actors.

It's great to see this movie winning best picture, because this one actually deserves it this time. Chiwetel Ejiofor does a great job and really makes the audience feel that they understand his plight. Every actor does their part, including Michael Fassbender returning as a villainous slave owner.<br/><br/>I have heard some talk about people not wanting to see this movie because it's just another slave movie. If you compare it to something like ""Lee Daniels the Butler"" we can see that this movie is far FAR better that that movie in practically every department. People aren't playing comical caricatures of historical figures, they are actually able to embody the characters. The soundtrack is fantastic and while the violence is brutal, it's never excessive or indulgent.

Emotionally difficult to endure and excellently acted, with not a single cast member holding the film back in any way. McQueen's trademark of long takes should put this one at the top of the list of any aspiring directors or cinematographers out there; however, there are a handful of shots that linger on close-ups with seemingly no other purpose than to force the characters' feelings on the audience even though it had already been successfully established moments earlier.

"metalrage666","9","1","3","29 April 2014"," An excellent, tragic & powerful movie.
","12 Years a Slave is another example of a movie that starkly shows the brutality of slavery as seen through the eyes of the person that lived to tell the tale.<br/><br/>I had never read the book that the movie is based on and with any movie that uses a book as it's source you have to go in with the foresight that not everything is going to be factual. Even if the movie was exactly as per the book, the story is still only going to be one sided as there can be no differing opinion to the same circumstance.<br/><br/>In any case, even if the story was only half true, it still makes for powerful viewing. <br/><br/>Free man Solomon Northup is a educated man living in Saratoga New York with his wife and 2 children. A chance meeting with 2 white traveling entertainers, has them convincing Solomon to travel to Washington with them as he can play the violin. During dinner, Solomon is drugged and when he awakes he finds himself in a cell in chains. So begins his descent into a nightmare of slavery.<br/><br/>It turns out that his 2 white ""friends"" were nothing more than con-men who drug black Americans and sell them into slavery. His name is suddenly no longer Solomon and instead he gets renamed ""Platt"" and is regarded as nothing more than a recaptured runaway slave.<br/><br/>The film is regarded by some as nothing more than a film that glorifies torture and sadism through exceptional and extreme methods of punishment, however this is an excellent portrayal of what innocent people went through on a daily basis for over a hundred years for no other reason than a difference in skin colour. If you were black you had no rights and were traded as cattle or property. Family's were often forcibly separated, with mothers having their children torn away from them never to be seen again.<br/><br/>While the violence and tones of despair throughout the movie are quite often very hard to take, it has been lauded as one of the most accurate accounts of what slavery for many was really like at that time. Even if you were free, you still needed papers to prove it and compared to the whites at the time you almost had no rights at all. <br/><br/>Too many reviews have cast this movie down for incidents and actions taken by Solomon as not making any sense. The questions posed by many such as ""why didn't he do this or that or the other"", are stupid when watching a movie and therefore being completely separated from whatever situation they are watching. Slavery was more than just oppression, there were ill fated consequences for any slave that was found to be educated, literate or was considered as a flight risk. Case in point, when Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o is brutally whipped, almost to death as the master believed she had run off. Constant fear can make a person do strange things and when seen in retrospect, a lot of what Solomon did throughout the movie makes quite a lot of sense.<br/><br/>The film has many tense and shocking moments and regardless of whether or not you believe the story to be factual, you'd have to be a robot to not run through a gamete of emotions while watching this film, particularly when he is reunited with his family after enduring so much. The film is not a documentary and it never claims to be, yet numerous scholars have researched the book and regard it as a true account of Solomon Northup's experience, despite it being largely ghost-written by a white person.<br/><br/>12 years a slave is a must see movie with outstanding performances done by pretty much everybody that's in it."

My second was in danger of never seeing the light of day. As I sat and watched 12 Years A Slave I was slowly overwhelmed by the sense of dread that no words I could possibly bring forth could do justice to what is a truly remarkable piece of cinema. I was then struck by the notion that there are probably very few people on Earth whose words could. But films like this exist to inspire and even if my words fail to capture the greatness of 12 Years A Slave, if even just one of you ventures to your local cinema to see it, then I will have accomplished what I set out to do.<br/><br/>Set in the mid 1800′s, 12 Years A Slave tells the story of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a man free born, living in up state New York with his family and earning a living as a carpenter and fiddle player. In 1841 Solomon is kidnapped and sold into slavery, forced to work on the cotton plantations of Louisiana. Initially in the service of the relatively benign William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), circumstance eventually sees him sold to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) a scripture quoting plantation master who believes it is his religious right to own and abuse those he considers his property. What follows is the most harrowing and heart breaking piece of film making since Schindlers List.<br/><br/>Helmed by British director Steve McQueen (Shame, Hunger), 12 Years A Slave has been rightly lauded as ""one of the best films ever made"", a sentiment with which I take no issue whatsoever. Everything about the film is inspired. The performances from the leads are breathtaking, Ejiofor and Fassbender quite rightly gaining Oscar nods for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Fassbender in Particular is immense. His portrayal of Edwin Epps is as terrifying as it is ultimately pathetic. The supporting cast all shine brilliantly in their cameos – Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Brad Pitt and Sarah Paulson being the most notable.<br/><br/>However special praise must be reserved for young Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o. Making her American film début she steals the film with her fleeting performance as Patsey, a young girl born into slavery and the target of Epps salacious intentions. An Oscar for Best Supporting Actress is surely inevitable. A tip of the hat must also go to the production design. The plantations of 12 Years A Slave are a far, far cry from the shining white mansions and lush green fields of other films of similar subject matter. Everything is drenched in a shroud of slow decay and stained with blood and sweat, a mirror into the souls of those who lived and died there.<br/><br/>As I reach these final lines, I am once again struck by the reality that these few paragraphs will in no way shape or form express the true greatness of 12 Years A Slave. I can only hope that once you have seen this film for yourself you will be at the same loss for truly fitting words to describe it as I have found myself.<br/><br/>RocknReelReviews.com"

","McQueen has, in my opinion, done a great service to the world in delivering '12 Years a Slave' to the big screen. It offers a quality which other films shy away from or never truly live up to; the harshness and brutality of the real world. <br/><br/>Where genre classics 'Roots' or 'Amistad' fell, '12 Years a Slave' picks up the pieces, forcing audiences to watch a disgustingly harsh and horrifyingly true two hours of rape, kidnapping and merciless punishment - a very real depiction of the slave trade.<br/><br/>The emotion McQueen is able to capture through uncomfortably extended shots is unmatched and, although a little too awkward for more passive viewers, highly appealing to the veteran movie guru. <br/><br/>If you're searching for the film to watch that will show you to the extreme the true conditions of the slave trade, without much hand- holding, '12 Years a Slave' will blow you away. However, I would not recommend this for the average passive viewer as some scenes may disturb you, beyond the point of appreciation."

","I will be reviewing Academy awarded and nominated films. The first in this series is ""12 Years A Slave.""<br/><br/>I watched it last night. An emotionally draining film. It was brutal and depressing. The acting was outstanding by the entire cast. I am not surprised that this film won 131 of the 137 nominations received. (Academy Awards, Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, Screen Actors Guild, and so on )12yearsaslave<br/><br/>Award winning director, Steve McQueen, has directed many short, and one other feature films. 12 Years A Slave should allow for this talented director to finally explode in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Solomon (portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor) tells about his need to Survive. As a FREE man once living in upstate New York, Solomon is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Although Solomon hid the fact he was educated, and could read and write — he oftentimes stood up for himself, (but rarely for others). The fear that filled him was powerful. His goal remained constant, and commendable  to stay alive and make it back home to his family. To Freedom.<br/><br/>While some of Solomon's encounters reveal. . .kindness, most of the slave owners and hired hands treat the slaves with less respect than what is shown to pigs in a stable. This is not an easy movie to watch. The violent and abusive physical, mental, and sexual treatment of human beings was more than enough to make my stomach churn. I had a constant knot in my gut, and oftentimes had to wipe tears from my eyes. There are countless scenes where people are whipped, hung, beaten, berated and raped.<br/><br/>However, this was a movie I am glad I saw. It was powerful and provoking. It made me angry and very sad. I find it difficult and horrifying to believe slavery was prevalent in our country, and even more shocking that it lasted as long as it did.<br/><br/>12 Years A Slave is an ""R"" rated, 134 minute long film that will hold you captive. It is the compelling story and the constant disgust that kept me from rarely so much as blinking. There are far too many actors and actresses to name. All deserve credit for their roles in the film. All deserve awards. It is only March 2014, but I believe I've just seen the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>Phillip Tomasso Author of The Vaccination Trilogy and other equally impressive novels! http://wwww.philliptomasso.com"
"cordenw","7","1","3","8 March 2014"," Pretty good but mediocre directorship in some scenes
","Better than most of the movies I've seen lately and the acting was superb from just about everyone. When big names like Brad Pitt and Paul Giamatti give you some of their best stuff, even though they're in minor parts, you know you're watching something good. It's hard to get your head around the fact that this is pretty recent history and it's still an open sore in America. The acceptance by the majority of white society at the time, of the concept of ownership of a human being , is something that still mystifies me. Mind you if you watch a few episodes of Downton Abbey and see how the staff were treated even up to the 1940s you will get a good idea where it came from. Can you believe that a Naval Architect from Liverpool was given an award for a design that allowed for more slaves to be jammed in at the prow of a slave ship? But I digress. This is raw and emotional stuff and it hits you right in the solar plexus. With that in mind, you don't really need to linger with shots of extreme anguish such as the scene with the rope, or the close up of Solomon Northup's despairing face. It's only a minor flaw but you would think that somebody would have whispered in the director's ear that these key scenes could have been shortened for more effect.<br/><br/>To say you enjoyed a movie like this doesn't seem right but there's redemption in the thought that those days are behind us in North America (only to be replaced by wage slavery in many cases.) It's important to remember too that real slavery still exists in many other countries and we shouldn't get too smug when we point out the shortcomings of other nations... we've still got a big bill to pay!"

"joetufano882","9","1","3","21 February 2014"," Worth watching at least once in your life
","I finally got the chance to view ""12 Years a Slave"", and I'm really glad I did because this is one of the most brutal and powerful films I've seen in my life including ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"".<br/><br/>Plot(Spoilers): Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man who's got it all living with his family in Saratoga, NY one day is tricked by two white men into believing he's going to play a music show in Washington D.C. and is sold into slavery on a plantation in Georgia. He then spends the next 12 years of his life (hence the title of the film) as a slave trying to survive everyday hoping for an opportunity to get a message back home or to get home himself and with the eventual help of Bass (Brad Pitt) finally returns to his family.<br/><br/>The acting all around is spot on: Chiwetel Ejiofor is very effective at playing a man who loses everything and there are a few scenes in this film that make you feel for his character and even shedding a tear for him. I've always known him as the bad guy from ""Four Brothers"" and thought of him as a good actor but he is definitely deserving of his Oscar nomination. Michael Fassbender's character (Edwin Epps) is one of the most despicable characters I've ever seen in a movie, and Fassbender knocks it out of park. His wife played by Sarah Paulson is arguably more of a monster than he is because of certain actions she commits and things she says in the film regarding a certain character. There is a scene which is shown in the trailer where she says (master brought you here to work, anything more will earn you a hundred lashes), and she says it with a look on her face that's as cold as ice. Newcomer Lupita Nyong'o as Patsy is very good at tugging at your heartstrings, Benedict Cumberbatch (KHAAAANNN! Sorry, couldn't resist) is good as the slave owner who is surprisingly a compassionate person but is ultimately a coward when given an opportunity to make the right choice. Paul Giamatti and Paul Dano do very commendable work with their roles and as for Brad Pitt: yeah when he first appeared on screen I knew what direction they would take with his character but that being said he did great playing the part.<br/><br/>Everything else about the film is as close to flawless as you can get. The cinematography is breathtaking, Hans Zimmer's score is excellent as usual considering his scores for other films like ""Inception"" and TDK trilogy. Lastly the direction by Steve McQueen is spot on. I haven't seen his other two films ""Hunger"" or ""Shame"" which both also star Michael Fassbender, but McQueen I have a feeling that he will rise as one of the best filmmakers working today. There's three particular shots he uses in the film that just astounded me as to how they were done all in one shot. Usually some directors will do multiple cuts or simply drag on with one shot that you just get bored, but with these three takes that he uses, it was very effective and jaw dropping. There were times where I couldn't look at the screen, but I appreciated how Steve McQueen was honest in his direction at showing the brutality of slaver in this time period. <br/><br/>A lot of people have accused this film of having the same old song and dance and while some of that is there, what makes this different in my book is that they show things like Paul Giamatti's character showing off slaves to slave owners like he's a car salesman, or how a slave could get lashes if he/she picked less than 200 lbs of cotton or even not intervening when another slave is getting theirs in order to spare themselves. All that right there shows the brutality of slaver and how it was considered the norm at the time. And at the core of the film, there's a story about this man must figure out how to survive this terrible ordeal that has been cast upon him.<br/><br/>But overall, this film is absolutely worth watching at least once in your life. Great performances all around, well executed story and directed beautifully by Steve McQueen. Anyone who loves film or is into history should definitely check this one out. Just be warned though because it's not easy at times to watch. I don't know if I can watch it again anytime soon, but I don't regret seeing it one bit."
"Avwillfan89","10","1","3","20 February 2014"," Painful, yet utterly rewarding...
","Steve McQueen's masterpiece 12 years a Slave is probably the most haunting, riveting, beautiful and unflinching depictions of human rights abuses of all time. This is not an easy watch at all, as it is not what a normal movie would do, which is to entertain. It left me with an impact that went beyond anything I'd seen in years. This is truly an accomplished work of art and an astonishing piece of storytelling.<br/><br/>What is truly disturbing about this film is that the issue of slavery itself is not not just a thing of the 1800s; it still goes on today. Even as we speak, people are enslaved, beaten, raped, psychologically abused and forced to work under appalling conditions. <br/><br/>As McQueen pointed out in his Bafta speech, there are 21 million people enslaved today, and that he wishes that no other director would, 150 years from now, have to make another film like this one. <br/><br/>This film explores the core of human suffering, and the basic nature of humans who want to be free more than anything else. There is no worse sound than the silence of the holocaust that is slavery.<br/><br/>10 out of 10, if I could give it more, I would."

","12 Years a Slave is a biopic about African American, Solomon Northup(Chiwetel Ejiofor) who was a free man in New York, until the day he was forcibly sold into slavery. After being treated in the most inhumane way for several years by his slave owners, Freeman(Paul Giamatti), Ford(Benedict Cumberbatch), Tibeats(Paul Dano) & the most brutal of them all, Edwin Epps(Michael Fassbender), Solomon tries to prove desperately that he is in fact, a free black man. <br/><br/>This film is flawless from start to finish. It can make you weep like you've never wept before. The viewer really feels the pain & suffering of Solomon & his fellow slaves like, Patsey(Lupita Nyong'o). One of the aspects that make the film what it is, is the cinematography. The American south of the olden days, has been captured beautifully. Some viewers may find this movie disturbing due to all the violence inflicted upon the slaves, especially by cruel cotton plantation owner, Edwin Epps. There is lots of gore but, it is not unnecessary. You might feel like some scenes are quite explicit however, this movie is worth sitting through all those difficult scenes. The reason is because, at the heart of the film is the heart wrenching story of a man who was happily married, with two children, who was a free man his whole life, had to go through such a horrifying experience. Another factor that makes this movie worth watching is the cast & their incredible performances. Although most of them have been given small roles, they all play their part to perfection. Chiwetel Ejiofor has given his career's best performance as Solomon Northup. The expression of pain & vulnerability on Northup's face has been portrayed by Ejiofor, flawlessly. Michael Fassbender is vicious & wicked as Edwin Epps. Fassbender's portrayal of the heartless slave owner shows no restraint or remorse. I'm sure this is Fassbender's career best turn too. Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant as Ford. The Sherlock star, transitions from a British accent to a Southern accent, effortlessly. Paul Dano is great as Tibeats. Paul Giamatti is outstanding as Freeman. Lupita Nyong'o shines in her debut film. Sarah Paulson is impressive as Epps' insecure wife, Mistress Epps. Alfre Woodard is good as Mistress Shaw. Last but not the least, Brad Pitt is mind blowing in his cameo as, Bass. The supporting characters are effective as well. All in all, 12 Years a Slave is a must watch & deserves all the accolades & awards that it's most probably going to get."

"cinematic_aficionado","8","1","3","29 January 2014"," Disturbing and didactic
","One thing that is certain about ""12 years a slave"" is that it is a disturbing and engrossing experience. If you are faint hearted, then this movie is certainly not for you. Nevertheless, its didactic prowess makes it a must see.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a black American born in New York early in the 19th century. Although slavery was still a fact of life in parts of the country, Solomon was born and raised a free man and it was through trickery that he travelled south to meet some supposed business partners who ended up selling him as a slave.<br/><br/>From that point on, his Odyssey begins. He experiences life through a prism that is worlds away from what he thus far knew. In the plantations of the Southern States being black equals not being human. You can call it property, pet, object of gratification or any other denigrating pseudonym. In the minds of their owner where this mentality was deeply ingrained this gave them the freedom to treat 'their' slaves in ways that was beyond inhuman. So great were their convictions, that they even quoted Bible verses as another affirmations to the appalling way they treated their fellow human beings.<br/><br/>Solomon, having experienced freedom was more affected that his counterparts who simply knew nothing else. What kept him going is a sense of hope that he would regain his freedom and return to his loved ones. Hope dies last.<br/><br/>This is a mighty historical and moral tale as well as a brave cinematic endeavour. Slavery still scars the United States and despite the distress this film will cause it ought to simultaneously serve as a source of edification to guide us in a direction of equality and acceptance. Inhumanity never pays off, only compassion."

","On first Impression I would liken this film to the movie 'A Girl Next Door.' Both movies were absolutely horrible to watch, but left me thinking deep questions about society,and my part in it. Sadism sells,you only have to look at the Saw Franchise to see this. Saw became so successful financially that it even has it's own fairground ride. To use violence in cinema effectively requires a great skill for not only the actors but the plot,the characters and direction, all have to remain very focused. Each slave in this film has their character developed so when they are objectified the viewer knows the slaves inner working, their humanity. 12 years a slave has excellent acting, extremely emotional performances from all it's cast. And with ironic thing , is there is a theme of suppressing one's emotions and intelligence in order to not draw a small minded society's wrath. The plot allows the gradual mental decline of a 'master.' to move with the mental discipline of a 'slave.'Like the raiders of the lost arc in poses the question of does absolute power drive people to mental and spiritual desolation? If you are ready for a film that will emotionally challenge you, then watch this film. It may make you build empathy towards black history. (this is a politically correct term in the uk! ) also dare I say it might remind you what potential ""immigrants"" are facing in syria and north Korea in this present day."
"take_the_cannolis","7","1","3","24 January 2014"," Good Movie but could have been better
","In my opinion, this movie certainly has many positives but unfortunately has also has many negatives. To start off the original story was both remarkable and compelling. There was plenty of material there to work from without much need for embellishment. Overall the acting throughout the film was generally quite good especially the acting of Chiwetal Ejiofor. I thought his performance in many ways kept the movie grounded and more realistically compelling. I also thought the cinematography and period set designs were also very good.<br/><br/>On the other hand there were several aspects of the film that for me just didn't work well which is why I could not rate the movie any higher than I did. Steve McQueen may end of being a great director but I feel he is just too reliant on gimmicks and cliché directorial techniques. For example, some the flash-back, flash-forward segments were confusing and unnecessary, especially the micro back and forth scenes where he was actually being abducted. I don't know what point he was trying to make there at a time when the continuity of the scene should have been clear and instead was unnecessarily fragmented and confusing.<br/><br/>Use of the long drawn out face shots and close-ups also seemed pointless and just served to slow the pace of the film down. There were also just too many things in the movie that were not explained either at all or well enough. Examples of such are: where did Brad Pitt's character come from? He just all of the sudden was there with very little if any character background information or purpose. The time element was also blurred. The film's title implied that this all took place over 12 years. You never got the feeling that 12 years had passed. The main characters appearance didn't seem to change much if at all until makeup people sprinkled some Gray dust on Solomon's head at very end. There are other examples. I thought Michael Fassbender's portrayal of a lunatic plantation owner was way over the top as the character would have more likely been committed to an insane asylum than a owner of a working farm.<br/><br/>The score by Hans Zimmer seemed rather strange at times as well. I am a big Hans Zimmer fan but there were moments where I felt the music would have been more appropriate for War of the Worlds than for 12 Years a Slave. I also felt that some of the costumes were a bit over the top and too formal.<br/><br/>In summary, I think the film would have much better if the director would have just gotten out of the way and let the very compelling and tragic story and great actors carry the load."

This scene was brutal to the extent that it delivered the pain personally to me.<br/><br/>Chiwetel has made the performance of his whole career.<br/><br/>Great cinematography and great customs.<br/><br/>And let's not discuss the religious part, you would see that this Scripture is what gives those in the greatest pain to believe that there's hope and one day justice will be done, but you would also feel the hatred towards the same Scripture that would allow people to go that far of abusing other human beings and do these inhumanly acts."

Making money through his trade as a skilled carpenter and talented musician, Northup was a free man accepted by the community of the upper class in Saratoga Springs. Two men then come into Northup's life under false pretences of a job opportunity, and instead drug and sell him into slavery. Solomon is sold to a number of different plantation owners and meets a number of different individuals along the way. These individuals include an impressive array of cameo performances by Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Gimatti, and Michael Fassbender (playing the heartless cotton plantation owner).<br/><br/>Although hosting an extraordinary cast, the true stars of the show were (somewhat unknown actor) Chiwetel Ejiofor and director Steve McQueen (Best known for Hunger (2008) & Shame (2011)). The combination of sharp close-ups and silent lingering shots allows Ejiofor to deliver the performance of a lifetime. This true story is remarkable and must not be ignored, conveyed with such beauty and passion the film is a must-see.<br/><br/>That being said, be warned it is not a film for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>***** 5 Stars<br/><br/>Currently nominated for 9 Oscars: 1.Best Motion Picture of the Year 2.Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role 3.Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role 4.Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role 5.Best Achievement in Costume Design 6.Best Achievement in Directing 7.Best Achievement in Film Editing 8.Best Achievement in Production Design 9.Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay"

","This is based on a true story about the writings of Solomon Northup. A freeman in 1841 who had a wife and family. He was a violin player who was tricked into the promise of a job by two men who drugged him and sold him into slavery for 12 years. Now this is not an easy film to watch. Some very harsh scenes on how slaves were treated on the south back then. Solomon played by Chewitel Ejifor in a great performance spent his time with 3 different slave owners. All treating him in different ways. The pain and suffering he had to endure was moving and very inspiring. Michael Fassbender plays the harshest owner he faced and he is amazing as a cruel human being who believes he can do what he wants with his property. Steve McQueen the director puts us in the thick of it and really shows the brutality of slavery. The music in the film is great as well as the performances and whole production looks great. This is a film that stays with you and can affect you with the harshness of the story. This film should win best picture at the Oscars in March. I highly recommend this great and very moving film."
"GrowMagicBeans","7","1","3","14 January 2014"," A harrowing story of a free man made slave
","When Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an African American violin player, wakes up in a cell, bound and chained, he finds he has been swindled by two traveling business men. The abducted Solomon, a northern sate freeman, is shipped off to the south and sold into slavery to a plantation owner. In a prejudice land governed by the harsh realities of economics and beliefs in white superiority, no one wants to hear the truth behind Solomon's incarceration. His bond is passed over to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) - a master who has the reputation for little leniency towards his slaves. Solomon quickly learns it is dangerous to reveal his true identity. The movie traces the twelve years Solomon must endure this incarceration, away from a wife and children.<br/><br/>It certainly is a strong and powerful narrative, one made all the more harrowing by the fact that it is based on a true story and works well as a reminder of our not so distant past. Chiwetel Ejiofor puts in a strong performance as the suffering Solomon and the director, Steve McQueen, is not afraid to let shots linger to create ambiance and feeling. It is a movie that certainly checks all the boxes for the Best Picture award it picked up in both the Oscars and Golden Globes.<br/><br/>For me though, in many ways 12 Years a Slave has very little to offer past being an interesting and intense narrative. I felt I've seen this theme before, played out in other movies. Yes, the movie is challenging in so far as it exposes some of the sadistic brutalities of our human condition, but I do like a movie that truly makes me look at a subject matter, physical or metaphysical, in a new light. 12 Years a Slave is a straight movie which tells a story that at best, can only reaffirm those beliefs and condemnations I already hold! I know that will probably prove a crowd pleaser for the mass, but to me, McQueen's other works (Shame and Hunger), perhaps delve deeper into the human psyche in so far as they ask visceral questions about ourselves through lead characters of greater ambivalence. I guess what I mean is, I felt strangely removed from the Solomon character, as if I could share in his indignation without ever having to get to know him truly.<br/><br/>That's not to say that 12 Years a Slave is not a fine piece of work and cannot hold a mirror up to expose the contradictions of the human soul in its own right. The villain, Michael Fassbender as the troubled master, Edwin Epps, is perhaps the most interesting and intense character. We get to see this conflicted man exposed though the relationships with his jealous and spiteful wife, his slave girl mistress, his twisted interpretations of bible and God, and his contempt, perhaps brought about through his own insecurities, for Solomon. A jigsaw of a man, who is the personification of injustice within a disquieted society struggling in conscience, in a changing world. <br/><br/>If you are one that enjoys a powerful and intense narrative, without distracting twists or meandering sub-plots, than this will be an enjoyable watch."

","This film is simply majestic. We have here a tortuous tale based on the book of the true story of a black man cheated and sold into slavery in 19th Century America.<br/><br/>A frightening tale, this film is unflinching in its portrayal of the fear and drudgery of the world of slaves on the deep south, from their trade to their dehumanising work & treatment, and their ultimate death in the case of the majority of them.<br/><br/>You will feel uncomfortable with this film and its subject, but you will remain riveted. We all know about the evils of slavery (or believe we do) but once in a while we need reminded and this film captures that perfectly.<br/><br/>The film avoids silly caricatures, and over dramatisation. Instead it revolves around a strongly written script, some powerful acting and some beautifully shot camera work.<br/><br/>Our leads will little better in the roles they undertake later on in their careers. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup who we see as the free man enforced into slavery is just immense, whilst Michael Fassbender as one of his slave owners is deliriously insane but believable and frightening. We see a whole set of characters throughout, with many thankfully not resorting to clichés. It truly is wonderful.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film highly enough. There is little if anything negative to say against this, it is simply a marvel, and all will feel educated and rewarded by a viewing of this harrowing tale."
"BeneCumb","7","1","3","10 January 2014"," Great performances and directing, moralizing plot
","Virtually every country has black spots in its history - some countries have them currently, too, including slavery (now hidden or under some other name/form). Depicting this together with understandings prevailing in the 19th century provides a good basis for dramatic events and intense human relations, where different races/genders/backgrounds approach or collide.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly gifted Steve McQueen has fully exploited those opportunities plus has managed to attract famous and talented cast even into short supporting roles (Benedict Cumberbatch as William Ford, Brad Pitt as Samuel Bass, Paul Dano as John Tibeats, Paul Giamatti as Theophilus Freeman). But the strongest and longer visible roles (with close-ups of faces) are performed by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup, Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey; I would not be surprised if any of those achievements is honored with Golden Globe and Academy Award.<br/><br/>As for the script, the beginning is protracted and confusing, and I felt an attempt to burden the white with additional guilt and shame for the past, for their forefathers, especially in case of those living in the Southern states. At the same time, all great nations have based their wealth on penal servitude, slaves, overseas natives etc.<br/><br/>I have to admit that Django Unchained by Quentin Tarantino impressed me more. And last but not least - I wonder why a panoramic movie about US history had to be accomplished by Brits mostly..."
"valadas","8","1","3","4 January 2014"," Explosive images and superb acting
","Black is beautiful. This is in my opinion the best movie about slavery ever made. Because it portrays the drama of slavery not only in the usual general terms but also the personal and individual drama of the main protagonists with great depth. A free black man who lives in the north with his wife and children is abducted and taken to Georgia where he is turned into a slave to work as a farm labourer in extremely hard conditions. Through the story dramatically very well told in images and scenes we are also aware of the process of slavery with all its course of violence and the severe violation of the most basic human rights of men and women. The images and scenes are powerful and extremely impressive. The acting by all performers is superb and there is a remarkable set of black performers who do an excellent job. This is in fact an unmissable movie."
"YJLcool","8","1","3","29 December 2013"," a powerful drama that shows the brutal practise of slavery in the past
","12 Years a Slave, based on 1853 autobiography book written by Solomon Northup himself, a New York born free African American who was kidnapped in 1841, sold into slavery, received harsh treatments when working on plantations for 12 years before his release. <br/><br/>The film painfully displayed the cruel and evil nature of humanity, performing hideous acts of racism to others...where people are treated as mere properties, not human beings.The hanging, raping, beating and whipping of the black slaves are heart-wrenching at times to watch. More specifically, the abuse and torture Patsey received are brutal and inhumane when she's done nothing wrong at all. It makes you constantly wonder what wrong they had done to deserve such brutal treatment from others...just because of different skin colour? It's actually despicable for the people to even dare to speak about God when they do sinful acts of cruelty themselves on others.Furthermore, the film also shows that not just white men at that time and age were evil, but the black slaves as well. They just choose to ignore the pain and sufferings of their fellow for fearing that they may receive a harsher punishment. <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor managed to deliver a convincing performance, successfully conveying his emotions during the sufferings.I find myself nearly in tears when he is finally returned to his family and he said sorry to his wife in tears.Other supporting actors (Paul Dano, John and particularly Fassbender, Epps) did a great job in making the audience hate them so much to the point we actually cheer Solomon as he hit Paul's character back with the whip and Solomon is finally free from Epps when Mr.Parker arrived to rescue him. <br/><br/>The downside of the movie is the lack of a great score to make the emotional scenes pack a punch. Although Hans Zimmer is hired as the composer, but it seems that he just reuse Inception's main theme for the film. As a result, it does hurts the film a little.<br/><br/>Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a powerful drama that shows the brutal practise of slavery in America of the past. It reminds us about men's cruelty to its own kind.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10"
"falcata_claymore","10","1","3","28 December 2013"," It's not just the best film of the year; it's the best film in years
","Approximately fifteen minutes into 12 Years a Slave, Solomon Northrop- having just been captured and about to be sold into slavery- receives a savage beating for daring to claim to be a free man from New York, and not a runaway slave from Georgia. It is a brutal scene, shot in one long, unflinching take. It is an important scene, setting the stage for the brutality to come. And midway through it- amidst gasps from the audience- three people stood up and left the theater I was in, never to return. I don't quite know what they were expecting, but whatever it was, Steve McQueen's savage film about a free man thrown into slavery was too much for them. And let this be a warning to similar moviegoers: 12 Years a Slave is graphic, unsettling, frightening, and incredibly disturbing. The film is full of shocking acts of intense violence, all of which are shot up close in very long takes. It is a hard movie to watch. It is unquestionably brutal.<br/><br/>It is also unquestionably best film of 2013. The year isn't over yet, and there are several buzz-worthy films yet to come out such as The Wolf of Wall Street or Dallas Buyers Club, but I can't see 12 Years a Slave being topped, because it's not just the best film I've seen this year, it might be the best film I've seen since 2006, when Pan's Labyrinth was released. It's also the closest I've come to crying during a film since then.<br/><br/>The film's concept- based on Northrop's own memoir- is the stuff that Oscar bait is made of. But unlike many of its genre peers- skirting by the heavy subject matter by merely hinting at the true evils of slavery- McQueen pulls no punches. He does not want to inspire you. He does not want to uplift you. He does not want to reaffirm any belief you might have that mankind is good and that justice will be served, because it never truly was. Northrop regained his freedom, but he was one of few who did, and his efforts to bring the force of the law upon his captors all failed. McQueen tells it like it is, showing every act of violence as clearly and slowly as he can. He does not want you to be entertained for two hours- he wants you, the audience, to feel like you are suffering along with our hero. And he is viciously effective at doing so.<br/><br/>And McQueen is a master craftsman, and his film is shot, edited, and scored in an unconventional but startlingly effective way. There is little to no expository dialogue, for everything you need to follow the story is present in the images he presents to you, and every emotion you need to feel is clearly conveyed by star Chiwetel Ejiofor's expressive face. Even the score is incredibly minimalist- especially by the standards of composer Hans Zimmer. Instead of his usual theatrics, Zimmer creates a loose weave of tonal colors; I would never have thought it was him had the credits not told me.<br/><br/>And McQueen surrounds himself with an incredible cast- Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Brad Pitt, Paul Dano, and Garrett Dillahunt all turn in wonderful performances, and Michael Fassbender gives a terrifying, fiery turn as a cruel and perverted plantation owner. But all of them- even Fassbender, who, as always, gives the film his all- are in the shadow of Chiwetel Ejiofor. Much of the film is carried by his body language, his expressions, and his powerful voice. If there is justice in the world, then he will take home the Academy Award for best actor this February, and McQueen will take the Oscar for Best Director. The film itself will win Best Picture. It has to. It simply has to.<br/><br/>As the film came to a close, much of the audience left in tears, and I sat in stunned silence as the credits rolled by, unable to move or speak. It is not only recommended that you see 12 Years a Slave, it is necessary that you do so. It is a masterpiece. Decades from now, people will speak of this film as a classic. And you need to see it now- on the big screen- so that you can say that you were there. I do not believe you- or I, for that matter- will ever forget it"
"jnelso19","10","1","3","1 December 2013"," A Necessary Film That'll Test You
","As an self-professed cinephile, I followed this film in it's pre-production days and at the least, knew it was going to have potential. The story itself is pretty self explanatory. A man living the perfect life (or as much as a black man can in the 1840's) gets screwed over in the worst way possible and gets sold into slavery. Of course, with a story like that, you need the right director to properly tell it. Enter Steve McQueen, a soon to be known director who before this film, was really known by film critics and fanatics for his some could argue Oscar snubbed work with Michael Fassbender (Shame and Hunger). Also, these groups of people knew exactly what was coming of it if they saw his films as well. With his history of showing the dark realities of the taboo, you knew this was going to be a Tour De Force. Then you watch the movie and everything changes.<br/><br/>When you get into the movie, everything changes. What was once a man living the dream (so to speak) turns into what can best be described as 1800's hell. In that hell comes the story of survival that is 12 Years A Slave and with it comes to the actors and incredible story telling that takes us on a ride that quite simply makes the work of Django Unchained soft and yes I use the word soft.<br/><br/>In this hell, are the participants in the world and each one makes an incredible impression. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who before this was more known for his brief performances in Inside Man and Children of Men, pulled the performance of a lifetime and through the directing, put yourself into the journey of Solomon Northup. Through each lashing, each tear, each moment of survival, you wanted him to live and for that Ejiofor will be marked down for a performance that should be in the ranks of the greats in the past. Then comes the supporting crew around him that wasn't Brad Pitt (who coincidentally was the only good white man in the movie). The brief performances by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano and even Benedict ""Khan"" ""Julian Assange"" ""Sherlock Holmes"" Cumberbatch were all incredible and with the highlight performance from Michael Fassbender (we'll get to his character later), they helped provide a perfect picture of how white's treated slaves without really pulling any punches (like anyone could anyway since quite simply, the treatments were all accurate). As for the slaves, each one played their part but the highlights come from the actress who played Patsey. As a hardworking slave who had the biggest interactions with Fassbender's character, she knocks it right out of the park. You have no choice but to sympathize for her character and what makes it worse is the ultimate knowledge that she'll never get out unless death follows. Then comes Fassbender and his role of Epps. His character was at the very least complicated and one that despite all the screwed up stuff he does, you somewhat sympathize with him. How is that? Watch his interactions with his wife, Patsey and his facial expressions throughout the film. It really goes beyond the Calvin Candie slave owner and the fact you could possibly sympathize with him (I did and I hated myself for it) shows the incredible job that was done by both McQueen and Fassbemder into making it happen. Then there's the work behind the scenes.<br/><br/>The work behind the scenes in this movie was the most remarkable part of this film. The way Steve McQueen tells the story with the assistance of his film editor and cameraman was nothing short but extraordinary. Each scene had you by the heart and was willing and able to pull it out at anytime and it's all because of them. With the noose scenes, the whippings, and the words spoken, all had an impact and because of it, lead to the amazing film that put every white man into a purgatory of sorts to reflect on this dark period in history. This was all credit to the people behind the scenes and if justice is truly just. They'll all win Oscars in the months ahead.<br/><br/>Overall, no more needs to be explained about the film and it was incredible work done by everyone involved. Saying that, the film is a lot bigger than just an incredible film and in a way, was more necessary than any movie regarding slavery ever. As a white man watching this film, I knew what was coming of it and even though I was prepared, I was tested. It dared me to watch the hell that was presented on screen and take it as a history lesson and because of it, I'm a better person before I entered the movie which comes to the Jerry Springer-esque rant that's coming (Giving you the heads up if you want to turn back now).<br/><br/>One universal truth that is accepted along with gravity and death is that we can never take the past back. What has happened happened and whether we want to change it or not, it's not going to change what was dealt. As for slavery, not until much recently, was a very taboo subject in American History other than just a section admitting that it happened. No one wanted to touch, no one felt entitled touch it, no one respectively had the guts to touch it.A modern take was not only needed, but required in a time of much change in this nation's history. With the death of Trayvon Martin and films released such as Django Unchained and the very liberally biased The Butler, a film really needed to bring the subject matter in the Mel Gibson style light that it deserved. In order to educate, you need an objective, realistic and in this case, a non-American (McQueen is British) look at the material so only the truth is shown. That's exactly what happened."

","Let me say it this way... rather than go into a more involved review: <br/><br/>I noticed part way into the movie that I hadn't been able to take a full breath since shortly after the movie began.<br/><br/>I also noticed that the people around me weren't, hadn't been fully breathing either.<br/><br/>I think I did not breathe, could not breathe deeply until I was outside in the theater parking lot.<br/><br/>What kind of movie produces such a powerful effect on viewers???<br/><br/>A damn fine movie.

"nazztrader","8","1","3","27 November 2013"," If you can't stand the heat... (slaves didn't have that choice).
","To those who don't like seeing what the reality was like, I advise you to just take a moment and imagine if you had been a slave: ""there but for the grace of God go I."" Or have you not heard of that one? If you have a legitimate criticism about the film, that's fine. I too was wondering about Solomon's ""back story,"" and it's certainly possible he was a bit of a ""sketchy character."" To cite that possibility as a reason to dismiss his ordeal, however, demonstrates a lack of humanity. Instead, I would like the director to have figured out a way to make that less conspicuous.<br/><br/>In fact, I would rather have seen a different ex-slave's account as the basis for this kind of film. Or what about the subject being one of the major slave rebellions? We could have been shown what plantation life was like first, and then the audience would have to ponder some intriguing questions. Tension could have been built up effectively, whereas here Solomon is rescued with little drama. While this doesn't detract from his account, it does suggest a more creative cinematic approach should have been employed. And while this film is actually not nearly as ""graphic"" as it could have been, in terms of what some slaves experienced, there isn't much in the way of ""sugar coating,"" and in a sense the brutality becomes the focus of the film. Perhaps because of this, it leaves a somewhat scattered impression.<br/><br/>Unlike some critics here, I like the nature shots, and wish there would have been a better use of the scenery. If you don't have an idea of what that might accomplish, I suggest watching ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God."" And while it's certainly true there wasn't 'much in the way of ""comic relief,"" there didn't need to be. Instead, a more documentary style could have been adopted, and if so, odd or ridiculous mannerisms or situations could have supplied some kind of a break to the brutality presented. Again, the best movie I've seen that succeeds with this approach is ""Aguirre..."" Some of the things I really liked about this film included the sort of psychodrama aspect to living in this kind of society, as well as the physical proximity that often existed between slave owners and the slaves. It's almost like the slave owners felt the need to think that they controlled the minds of their slaves, though they might say that the slaves did not possess fully human minds. This film does a good job on these accounts. If you want to learn more, I suggest the book, ""Honor and Violence in the Old South,"" though I am not claiming I agree with everything the author argues. And of course there are the primary sources (""slave narratives"").<br/><br/>Some of the things I really liked about this film included the sort of psychodrama aspect to living in this kind of society, as well as the physical proximity that often existed between slave owners and the slaves.

","A bit slow to start and yet a movie with a delivery unlike any other. The story seems to be simple and yet it pulls at your conscience. The outstanding performance of almost all the cast makes this a truly deep and realistic portrayal of the injustices that were an everyday way of life in the slavery states during the PreCivil War era. <br/><br/>I found the dialog all too often difficult to comprehend. Thus, I was lost and frustrated by the script that tried too hard to give the viewer a much too lengthy and confusing scene with language that made little sense to the average viewer.

The film is so raw and brutal with it's scenes that it may turn many off still director Steve McQueen went to great measures to show how brutal and savage that blacks were treated by rich spoiled white land owners in the deep south. Based on the true accounts of one Solomon Northup(in a raw and emotionally honest performance from new guy Chiwetel Ejiofor)who in 1841 is in the northeast in upstate New York working as an actor and stage play person when one night he is lured to a trip to Washington, D.C. and is kidnapped by two southern men and taken to the deep south and sold into slave labor. Here on the plantation the cotton fields life is tough with beatings and whippings and chains are a daily occurrence for all blacks especially with all the sadistic ways of the owner(in a wicked performance from Michael Fassbender)who even has sex with many female black slaves. Most supporting is the meeting that Solomon has with a Canadian abolitionist(in a fine performance from Brad Pitt)this propels Solomon to be set free emotionally and mentally to actual freedom. Overall ""12 Years a Slave"" is a brutal and somewhat sadistic film still it's one man's true story of courage and will to live as he faced the wicked and evil establishment for many lost and wrong years that he had to spend his life away from freedom and reality."

","I don't know whether someone planned it that way or whether it's pure coincidence but on Friday last, two high-profile new releases opened in London simultaneously and both share a single theme, the oppression of one race by another, and today I watched both of them one after the other. I saw first 12 Years A Slave, in which the oppressor is the White race (specifically 'Southern' White) and the oppressed the Black race. Perhpaps it has been over-hyped as is, of course, often the way, but once again I had difficulty in seeing what all the fuss was about. Yes, the lead actor gives a fine performance - as I have seen him do on the London stage several times - but how difficult is it to look noble and stoic? I had the same problem - as I have said on this site in the past - with Raging Bull; okay, so deNiro put on several pounds, big deal; a real actor could ACT being heavy. Nevertheless the film does tell a harrowing story and by and large the cast do well but the only time I found myself weeping was at the end, when the victim was reunited with his family. I accept that mine is a lone voice but not to worry, actor and director will probably cry all the way to the Oscars."
"thomas-e-louise","10","2","12","19 October 2013"," ""Lift not the painted veil...""
","Is Solomon a sambo? In the sense of a token black who goes to great extremes of foolishness to entertain and appease white observers and to protect his privileged social position. His fiddle playing enthusiasm, his constant claim at freedom while those like him are being held in bondage, and his unmerciful act of turning down Patsy's plea to take her life, though he's able to take the whip in his hand to beat her, and his constant begging of whites to perform favors for him. <br/><br/>Throughout the film two stories are being told. One story is the story of a free man who is thrown into slavery and makes it home in the end. The other is the story of a man who imagines that he is free. The veil is never lifted for Solomon, but for us, the viewer, it is. We have the opportunity to briefly see him in all the vanity of his individualism and selfishness. A man that will use his intelligence to follow the rules, and risk his life just to send a letter, rather than save a single soul.<br/><br/>We too like Solomon are complicit in our privilege. While the practice of slavery continues, we dare to use words like freedom and liberty. We turn our backs on cries for help, like Solomon did to Patsy, and like a fellow slave did to him. We fail to see that there is something more morally significant than our personal lives. <br/><br/>Interesting how the cover shows Solomon running when he never tried to run. Many of us know the stories of slaves who ran, escaped, rebelled, and refused to participate. Why did McQueen choose this story of a slave whose spirit no one had to break because it was already broken. Maybe it is more representative of the contemporary spirit of acquiescence.<br/><br/>Have ye leisure, comfort, calm, Shelter, food, love's gentle balm?

","Movies aren't just a source of entertainment and escapism. They can educate the viewer on culture, the history of society and how it has developed to lead us to how we are today, depicting distant lands and the hardships that people have endured to ensure that others can lead a better lifestyle, history that we may not have come across otherwise. The film industry has the ability to hold a mirror to an audience, unapologetically delving into the unspeakable truths of our ancestors transgressions.<br/><br/>All will know what to expect upon deciding to see 12 Years a Slave. The absence of basic human rights, the immorality and apathy that is a prevalent theme to many throughout it's run-time. When Solomon Northup, family man and professional violinist is wrongly uprooted from his life as a free man, he is forced to change or die. Leaving behind all identity he becomes Platt, forced to implement his skills in carpentry and music whilst later working in the cotton picking fields, all the while enduring constant physical and mental abuse. Fassbender's portrayal of a slaver may seem the films obvious antagonist however if you look deeper, you find not only more human flaws such as jealousy, but also other examples of compliance and blissful ignorance. Such is the role of Benedict Cumberbatch's, Ford. Whilst he was a man of the lord who respected his work force, he often overlooked the slander and abuse dealt out by his overseers. Although he had no hand in this abuse, I believe his acceptance for how things were was just as deplorable as he was too weak to challenge the status-quo.<br/><br/>TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE (Photo: Jaap Buitendijk/FOX Searchlight)<br/><br/>Gifted for his time with Ford, Solomon receives a Violin. Throughout his hellish existence in the Louisiana heat he finds it to be his only solace as he experiences the five stages of loss and grief; Denial and Isolation, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. Beat into submission, he experienced disturbing acts of cruelty until he broke, defending himself, leading to unwarranted ramifications as he is sent to work with the unforgiving, Epps.<br/><br/>12 YEARS A SLAVE<br/><br/>Not only does 12 Years a Slave have an incredible cast of renowned actors, it also displays new talent. Fresh from drama school, Lupita Nyong'o brings a fresh face to the big screen as the troubled gem of Ebb's workforce, Patsy. Her début is a tour de force as she brings the performance into her own, avoiding being overshadowed by the A-list cast. A period film of this nature could potentially crumble if it has a weak link within, however I commend all involved for honest, poignant performances. My only small gripe was with Pitt's accent. Reminiscent of the Southern drawl of Lieutenant Aldo Raine in Inglourious Basterds, I struggled to take him too seriously as I constantly thought of the unconventional lead in Tarantino's quirky perspective of the World War.<br/><br/>Regardless of all the sadness and brutality which this film purveys, it never ceases to show the beauty of the Virginian countryside. Shots of swamps and marshes teeming with insects and wildlife, cotton fields and woodland amidst the chirping of Crickets and the tweeting of birds all aid in immersing you in the experience.<br/><br/>Throughout, it is an intense and relevant viewing, delving into the murky waters of our ancestral past. Underlining our wrongs whilst perhaps provoking discussion on how to avoid similar modern failures after the viewing, it stays no longer than it needs to yet it will endure with viewers for the foreseeable future."
"sddavis63","7","1","4","7 March 2014"," I Found This Surprisingly Lacking In Passion - But Maybe That Was The Point
","""12 Years A Slave"" won the Oscar for Best Picture, and has been perhaps the most talked about movie of the year. It also deals with a subject matter that's long been of interest to me. So, perhaps my expectations were for something different. But the thing that really stood out for me as I watched this was that for the most part it was surprisingly lacking in anything that could be called passion. I won't deny that there were moments of great passion - and that in an overall sense the movie certainly tugs at your heart as you consider Solomon's plight, and the nightmare into which he was suddenly transported, but there was also just an overwhelming dryness to it for lack of a better word. And then it occurred to me - that could have been the point of the picture.<br/><br/>This is the story of Solomon Northup (a true story, told by Solomon Northup in a book he published about his experiences in the 1850's) - a free black man from New York State kidnapped and sold into slavery in the antebellum south. That was not at all a rare occurrence. Being a free black in the era before the Civil War - even in a northern state - carried with it inherent risks. Solomon was a happy man, comfortable and with a family. His life in New York came across as perhaps too idyllic, as if there was no racism in New York, which was certainly not the case. But that also might be a deliberate and exaggerated contrast. Solomon's life in New York must have been a paradise, compared to the horror he was about to be confronted with - a horror that seemed to have no escape. You can feel for the character and his plight, and perhaps that explains the relatively passionless nature of the movie. To survive, Solomon probably did have to shut off his feelings for the most part. He had to numb himself to reality. Perhaps that's the point - one made early in the movie, after his sale into slavery, when he lashes out at Eliza (sold with him) - who can't stop wailing over the children she had been forced to leave behind. She lashes back at him for showing no emotion about his wife and two children. It occurred to me afterward that that one scene may have explained the entire feel of the movie - for Solomon (and for many, both white and black) slavery was dehumanizing (obviously) but it also numbed everyone who was a part of the hideous institution, allowing everyone (both whites who treated blacks like cattle, and blacks who were treated that way) to endure the south's ""peculiar institution."" So maybe the overall feel of the movie fit the story well, and made a point about both slavery and its effects on humanity. Blacks could be slaves but still act with great dignity; whites - simply because they were slaveholders - lacked that dignity; even the kindest slaveholder - such as Ford, Solomon's first ""master"" - was still a slaveholder, participating in an inhuman institution. That's clearly too much of a generalization about both whites and blacks, but even if painted with a broad canvass, the point comes across.<br/><br/>There were moments of high drama. In many ways the central scene of the movie is the whipping of Patsie. Patsie had become close to Solomon. She was also the special ""love"" (in the very sick sense that only slavery could breed) interest of Master Epps, and as a result the object of jealousy and cruelty from his wife. It all comes together in one scene that is raw with emotion. After Patsie gets in trouble, she's stripped and tied to a tree to be whipped. At first Epps can't do it, in spite of the encouragement of his wife. He hands the whip to Solomon and orders him to flog Patsie. Solomon tries to go ""light"" but is finally ordered to whip her hard or other blacks will be punished. Solomon has no choice, but still Epps eventually takes over the job himself, leaving Patsie brutalized and bleeding, with her back torn apart, lying down, being tended to by female slaves while Solomon looks on in horror at what he'd been forced to participate in. That was a powerful scene that brought home the evils of slavery - in much the same way, for example, that the whipping of Kunta Kinte to force him to say that his name was ""Toby"" was for me the central part of the TV mini-series ""Roots.""<br/><br/>Solomon's eventual release is a very dignified portrayal, as he's finally rescued by northern friends who find him and force the law to intervene and have him freed. The scene, I thought, was deliberately underplayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who played Solomon. The emotion revolves around two hugs - one for the white man who finally came to get him, and one for Patsie - who he leaves behind to face this brutal life alone (because what choice does he have.) Otherwise, Solomon keeps a stiff upper lip, so to speak, and even his eventual reunion with his family is a dignified one, as he apologizes for his appearance, explaining to them that he's been through a difficult time for the last few years.<br/><br/>It is perhaps a surprisingly passionless movie - but once you think about it, that makes a point about the institution of slavery itself. As I said, it numbs those who participate in it - either as slaves or as slaveholders. The slaves perhaps have their humanity raised up as they endure what must be the unendurable, the slaveholders have their humanity stripped away simply by their attempt to dehumanize other human beings. ""12 Years A Slave"" doesn't make for especially exciting viewing, but it is thought-provoking and provides a worthwhile reflection on the institution of slavery and its effects on everyone involved."
"Jerghal","7","1","4","2 March 2014"," Worst case slave scenario
","Are they going to give Oscars to the subject (abolishment of slavery) or to the film itself for it's own merits? 'Based on a true story' and about black slaves - BAM! Oscar guaranteed. The same used to be the case when you made a film about mentally retarded people even when the film itself was also retarded. Those guilt ridden white suits dare NOT give it an Oscar right? Or maybe it's a trade-off: they get to use the word 'nigger' (otherwise known as the n-word) as much as they want in a movie and in return black people get an Oscar or two. 'The Help' which was nothing more than a polite regurgitation of an old sore and was hardly worth an Oscar so I wasn't expecting much from this one. Fortunately it's actually a good film with an A-list cast. But as movies are heightened reality we do get an overly racist and sadistic plantation owner (great performance by Michael Fassbender) just as every German in a WWII film is a jew-hating killing machine who deserves to die in the most horrible way. Hollywood just likes good and evil to be nicely separated. They gave an Oscar to Ralph Fiennes as a sadistic camp leader in Schindlers List, so I expect the same for Fassbender here folks. With all this being said, despite it's 134 min runtine, it will pass in no time as it is just incredibly well made and is worth your time. And it does give you a good idea what the worst case scenario could have been for a black slave in the 19th century."
"seaview1","9","1","4","1 March 2014"," 12 YEARS A SLAVE for the Ages
","Director Steve McQueen (no relation to the actor) has made a name for his personal, bold themes (Shame) and has come of age with his latest, most affecting film, 12 Years a Slave, adapted by John Ridley from the novel by Solomon Northrop. Perhaps no major studio film has portrayed slavery in America so honestly and directly.<br/><br/>Solomon Northrop (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man in New York in 1841 with a wife and two children. He is educated and blessed with a talent for playing the violin. A tempting offer of work leads him to Washington D.C. where two white men trick him into being mistaken for a slave. Helpless and unable to communicate with his family or anyone who can help him, Solomon is pulled into the world of torture and servitude as a slave to be auctioned as a commodity in the South. Northrop is witness to inhumanity by white slave owners as families are torn apart. He is sold from one plantation to another and finds one owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender, a standout), who is not only strong willed but cruel and immoral. Time goes by, and he always maintains a sense of dignity and hope while exhibiting compassion for his brethren. Northrop's desperate attempts to escape or get a letter to his family need the sympathetic ear of a good Samaritan for his salvation.<br/><br/>Imagine being held against your will and performing menial, backbreaking work at the behest of cruel masters who strike out with deadly violence at the drop of a hat. Now imagine that as an educated slave, he dares not reveal his intelligence lest he be executed. Silence means survival. Rebellion is met with severe punishment and death. All this goes on year after year with little or no hope.<br/><br/>That it took this long in cinema history to depict this stain of human intolerance is sobering especially in the post-Roots generation. McQueen depicts the horrors of oppression and outright sadism while getting the details such as the frightened reactions of slaves to mere sounds. He also has a firm sense of time and place with striking visuals. Cinematography is excellent, and the period recreation is authentically convincing with historic set design and costumes as well as the flavor of music. The film is similar to the lean narrative of Clint Eastwood's recent films without the emotional pathos of Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Ejiofor (Salt) has the best role of his career, and aside from the always impressive Fassbender (Prometheus), the surprise performance has to be Lupita Nyong'o as perhaps the most tragic of slaves. Benedict Cumberbatch (perhaps the busiest actor currently) has an effective role of a sympathetic slave owner. In an interesting bit role, Saturday Night Live's Taran Killam shows a brief glimpse of dramatic potential. There are several name actors who take supporting or bit roles including Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, and Alfre Woodard. Brad Pitt has a brief but significant moment that is a turning point in the story. He had a significant role as producer in bringing the book to the screen, and it shows just how shrewd he was to take a chance on a story that needed to be told.<br/><br/>It's a very sobering journey in American history that is harrowing and painful, and by the time the powerful ending arrives, you may find yourself not only thoroughly drained, but more appreciative of the life of one person (whose postscript is also noteworthy). It's a difficult subject matter handled by McQueen with compassion and unflinching realism. A moving chronicle of a family torn apart amid historical injustice, 12 Years a Slave is about the indomitable human spirit and its ultimate triumph amid intolerable adversity."

","I think it is a good movie but people should not see it as just a movie. It illustrates how hard it was living as a black people. So, the costing and actor were successful enough to give 8 out of 10.

In second part it was so realistic that even I get filled with tears for seconds. I can recommend this movie for who are willing to learn something about how black people had hard times for living.How people see them and treat against them.

","By the end of the film I didn't know whether to clap for the spectacular performances or to cry by the message of hope, despair, love. This film explores the hardships of slavery like no other and shows the impact it had on any civilized man. It gives you the dynamic of even how blacks viewed one another differently based on freedom. It explores the extremely difficult moral sacrifices people had to make in order to survive. It displays the psychological break down of even the strongest individuals by racism and bigotry.Solomon was not the same 12 years later even when everything was on his side (you'll see what I mean when you watch). The acting is phenomenal and the experience is tear jerking all through out. If you like movies which touch the core of slavery and racism this is a must watch but you must be warned it is a very difficult film to watch without closing your eyes but at the same time it is an eye opener. I am excited to explore more of Steve McQueen's past works after watching 12 years a Slave."
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","4","1 February 2014"," Worthy and highly recommendable, but not flawless.
","Everything about 12 Years screams Oscar: period setting, heavyweight cast, topical subject matter with historical context and, the cherry on top, a Hans Zimmer score. Much like Lincoln last year, this is the ""traditional"" (read: safe) Best Picture nominee which the Academy loves to dote on and, although I don't put it in the same league as Gravity or Captain Phillips, I can see why it's become the favourite to win the biggest award in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Firstly, the acting is nothing short of amazing from all involved. In his first major lead role, as Solomon Northup, a free African American who is kidnapped and sold into slavery, Chiwetel Ejiofor wisely opts against histrionics in favour of a subtler, more impactful blend of gritty determination and soul-destroying vulnerability. He's surrounded by a range of top-notch supporting turns - including Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Brad Pitt, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o – with Michael Fassbender delivering yet another tour de force performance as ruthless slave owner Edwin Epps. <br/><br/>Then there's Steve McQueen's unmistakable style behind the camera, which, after Hunger and Shame, has been subdued slightly to ensure this drama is his most accessible work yet. McQueen employs his trademark long, lingering shots to powerful effect, notably during two unrelenting scenes of a near-hanging and a lashing. McQueen's oblique camera work and point of focus was, for some, cause for frustration in his previous two films, but here it only emphasises the dire circumstances these slaves endured and adds to the bleak atmosphere. <br/><br/>Not quite as monumental as the awards buzz would suggest and certainly not without flaws, 12 Years is nevertheless a worthy and highly recommendable motion picture, which admirably and honestly tackles a shameful portion of America's history."

It's excellent from beginning to end and so true to history. This movie made you think. My heart broke many times in this movie at the treatment of the slaves. It was heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time. They lived in torment yet they bore it together. There is so much heart in this movie, both by slave owner and slave. I don't want to give much of this movie away because there is so much that the viewer needs to see. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I truly enjoyed it and I give it 5++++ stars.

"CobraLaLaLa","10","1","4","29 January 2014"," Astounding movie with enormous emotion.
","Saw this movie today, and it stirred up a string of emotions in me. I have seen movies dealing with slavery before, but it has never impacted me as this movie did. Number one, the acting was impeccable from all sides by all actors. Chiwetel Ejiofor is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He turned in a powerful performance, drawing in the emotions of the character Solomon Northup, a MAN, who was kidnapped and stripped away from his family and sold into Slavery. I could feel the emotion from the Character, but could not fathom being in that predicament. I will not make this review very long, simply because I could write an essay on all the good points of the film. The dialogue between Solomon (Pratt) and Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o was astounding, heart-breaking, and explicitly honest. The communication between the 2 characters capture the despair, misery, and hopelessness felt by my ancestors during that time of National injustice, moral decadence, and Godlessness in the Laws, behaviors, and attitudes by Slaver owners, and Slave smugglers. <br/><br/>Acting was superb! I could not have picked a better cast. By the end of the film, I was just about in tears at the resolution and the emotion that ensued. A man's most prized possession is his freedom. Rob any man of that unjustly, and soon his hope, spirit, and soul will follow. But Solomon, was a man who did not, and would not give let his soul, and his spirit fall into despair and hopelessness. <br/><br/>When I look back and think about all the evil, maniacal, heinous, hideous, and despicable things we did, I can't help but shake my head. It is not a man in a red suit with horns we need to be afraid of, it is us. We are the worse of the worse. Who is the judge of what's morally right and what's immoral? Us? You gotta be kidding!! We KNOW that things we do are immorally wrong, but use the ""Law"" as a safety net to continue in evil doings. As Brad Pitts Character said in the movie, ""there is State law, federal law, and then there is ""Universal Law"". The y may pass a law tomorrow saying it is lawful for a man to lay with a 10 yr old girl and marry. But because it's ""lawful"" does that mean I would partake?? Regardless of what that law says, that act is incomprehensible!! Christ Law super-cedes man's law every time. <br/><br/>One reviewer wrote he believes Solomon and the 2 men who sold him into slavery were trying to pull some ""scam"" to make money and Solomon got the short end of the stick. That's what I mean, freedom, the freedom to say something as idiotic as that."

","Okay folks, sorry for the ridiculous delay between posts. Things have been a little bit crazy with Christmas and now Chinese New Year just around the corner. So a lot of movies to review and very little time to do it in. Hope you enjoyed our year-end podcast special. Now let's get on with this review.<br/><br/>Unless you've been enslaved yourself over the last few months, chances are that you've heard of this movie. Winning the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama and now nominated for best motion picture Oscar 2014, it's not hard to see why.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor (don't ask me how that's pronounced) stars as Solomon Northup. A true story based on the memoirs of the real Solomon Northup set in 1841 when there was a very unusual dichotomy between different American states. Black people could be born free in New York, as indeed Solomon Northup was. <br/><br/>A respected, skilled carpenter and fiddle player, he was given an opportunity to make some good money performing with a circus while his wife and children were away. Drugged and double-crossed, he wakes to find him self in chains. It soon becomes apparent that he has been sold into slavery. We join Solomon Northup as he endures a living hell, made all the more unbearable given that he was once a free man. Many of the slaves he meets along the way know no better, they are born into a life of slavery. Having once known freedom to then have it taken away from you; Solomon's experience must have been all the more devastating.<br/><br/>Forced to work on cotton fields, under the permanent threat of violence and death, Solomon's soul is crushed repeatedly to a point where most men would have just given up and died. <br/><br/>His ownership changes hands several times during the course of the 12 years, Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch); the reluctant slave keeper is the first. It's obvious he is torn between his duty as a slave keeper and his moral compass of what is right and wrong. Things reach their lowest under the ownership of Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). An evil man who believes it is his god given right to keep slaves. Epps finds himself developing a perverted attraction one of his female slaves, Patsey played by the magnificent Lupita Nyong'O.<br/><br/>Will Solomon ever be reunited with his family, or will his memoires and story be all that manages to find its way out to the masses? Watch to find out.<br/><br/>Enjoyed is not the right word to use when talking about this movie. What I should say is that this is a good movie, compelling cinema about a time in history that we would rather forget. But don't forget, the beast that was slavery spanned a more than significant 400 years in the history of America.<br/><br/>I had heard all manner of things before I saw this movie. That audiences were sickened by the brutal displays of violence, even if they were toned down from the descriptions in Solomon's book. With a powerful story and reports of outstanding performances, of course I had high expectations. Were those expectations met? More or less I would say.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is a very good film and I would fully recommend it to anyone that is a fan of serious powerful cinema. But for whatever reason, it just fell shy of my expectations as did the impact it had on me. I tried to explore why this might be so. I think the answer lies in the fact that the movie depicts true events, not events manufactured and strategically crafted by Hollywood to evoke an emotional response, something which Hollywood is a true expert at. <br/><br/>I did wonder why Solomon never really tried to escape, would it be that hard? Over 12 years, was there really never an opportunity to escape? Watching 12 Years a Slave, you have to remind yourself that what you are watching is not just cinema but also history. Only then can you begin to comprehend the horror. This is also why Solomon never turns into Rambo, kills all the bad guys and fights his way to freedom. <br/><br/>I found the movie to be less affecting and haunting than Django Unchained or The Shawshank Redemption, two other movies about the limits of human suffering, perseverance and triumph against the odds. Whereas 12 Years is powerful because it's true, Django and Shawshank were powerful because of how they were written and directed. Django left me thinking for days. Some of the imagery that Tarantino managed to direct and capture, especially one specific scene towards the end featuring Christoph Waltz, really affected me and lingered on my mind uncomfortably for days. Shawshank also managed to more effectively portray the duration of suffering the lead protagonist had to endure. In 12 Years I never felt like 12 years had actually passed, it felt more like a terrible one year.<br/><br/>Django for me is a more haunting and affecting tale of slavery, with 12 Years a Slave coming in a close second. Shawshank, however, remains the ultimate tale of human endurance.<br/><br/>This is an excellent and powerful lesson in history, perhaps not the absolute best in terms of similarly themed movies, but essential cinema nonetheless.<br/><br/>Highly recommended despite Brad Pitt's presence. Almost forgot to mention him. Yes his character is a good one, but his performance is still wooden and by the numbers.<br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10<br/><br/>FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"

This is a very well-made film, complete with the soundtrack of the hot, sticky, insect-infested southern States, which draws you further into the scene.<br/><br/>What disturbed me most about this film, aside from the fact that it is based upon a true story, is how this movie dredges up old hatreds, pains and sufferings that are best left in the past, and allowed to heal. I cannot help but think that this movie was engineered to win Academy Awards - which it certainly will do. However, film-makers do have a responsibility to ensure their work does not cause harm, whether directly or implied. What this film does is inflame anger and hatred in a new generation of African-Americans where it did not exist before, thereby carrying forward divisive and destructive feelings for years to come.<br/><br/>In summary: An excellent movie, but the single-minded pursuit of Oscar glory may have blinded the Producers/Director to the negative effect it will have, and thus undoing the hard work of many since slavery was abolished; e.g. reversing the uplifting and uniting feelings brought by films such as Spielberg's 'Lincoln'."

At that time African American were treated like chattel property that owners can move and buy as they want, a kind of hereditary slavery rise, as children born of a slave mother were slave as well. They were born and raise to be slave. <br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is not an usual slave story, as Salomon knows freedom. He was living in the North with his family, he has a job. Then, he has to deny his name, his freedom, who he is in order not to live but to survive. How a man can have the strength to endure this promise lifelong servitude? Mr.Ford, his first owner appeared, on the one hand as the worst one of them all as far as a slave owners is concerned because he is saying one thing but doing another. He knows that Salomon is a free man, and what does he do? Nothing. On the other hand he is not pure evil, if he was born in different circumstances he may have been a more acceptable person. Nevertheless, female characters have a great part in this story, either in good and bad ways. Patsey depicts a sort of stereotypes of the black young woman slave, who try to escape her faith from an assured death. In contrary , her master's wife, Ms Epps came out to be worst than her husband (starring Michael Fassbender) when she beg him to beat their slaves or whipped Patsey to death. Even when a slave woman let her children behind, a mother seems to have no compassion for her, when she may be the only person on earth who can understand what she's going through. Thus, a religious pattern is enlightened along the film as if Faith was the last way for Salomon to find peace and Freedom. A very special care is given to breathing, once when Mr.Ford save Salomon from death and once again when Patsey's been raped by Michael Fassbender character. The violon which Mr.Ford give to Salomon at the beginning of the film is a symbol of his previous life as a free man, it represents hope. When all hopes are lost Salomon fall into darkness and despair, burn his letter to his family and broke his violon. he is not fighting his destiny anymore. Until his testimony to Bass, whom genuinely save his life. <br/><br/>This film was very profound and I'll certainly remember it for a very long time partly because it taught me a few things about Slavery that I didn't know already and it encouraged me to read the book. I encouraged you to do the same!"
"DominickJMcGee","10","1","4","23 January 2014"," Solomon Northup's Story is Full of Tension, Anxiety and Raw Emotion
","From the moment Steve McQueen's Solomon Northup biopic 12 Years a Slave begins, we get the uneasy feeling that the inevitable is going to occur. Solomon is introduced to what seems to be a lucrative offer from two D.C. Circus men. Naturally, Northup accepts the offer as an opportunity to travel and do what he loves—play the violin, and it's paid. What more could you ask?<br/><br/>Sooner than later he is eventually turned over to the South and handed to the Slave Trade, which unfortunately displaces him from anywhere relatively close to his home for twelve years. <br/><br/>The beauty of this film lies within the cinematography of Sean Bobbitt and the acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o as well as the entire cast and crew. With certain scenes, comes powerful narrative story telling through the art of editing and shot composition. When tension is high, and you are inherently uncomfortable, waiting for the scene or shot to cut or end; it doesn't. McQueen even manages to leave us hanging, literally, on a long take while Northup struggles to break free from the rope barred around his neck attempting to end his life.<br/><br/>The scenes continue to line up a sense of irony with beautiful landscapes and rich textures with predominately white houses, and earthly attires. Which is ironic because of the contradiction it creates against the characters—there is nothing pure about Fassbender's Edwin Epps character, in fact he is perhaps the epitome of evil. There is nothing beautiful or pure like the colors represent about slavery to begin with. It is a great device that shows how hypocritical the characters can be. <br/><br/>12 Years a Slave does a remarkable job at keeping you emotionally attached and hopeful that, eventually Northup will escape, and make it home. And when that moment finally arrives we sympathize with him in a way that allows us to feel just slightly what it was like to endure such a struggle in an America brazen with extraordinary racial tensions."

","Everyone should watch this movie. Not just because it is entertainment but because I feel it is important to know and understand part of where we as humans have been. It will help you truly understand what some sacrificed in the past so some of us can have a better quality of life today. This particular subject mater of slavery helped shape the USA not all that long ago. For those that say it may be too uncomfortable to watch, I heard a retort summed up perfectly by Lupita Nyong'o who plays the role of Patsey in the movie. "" It gave me more than It cost me."" As for Lupita Nyong'o acting, it was FIRST CLASS! Give her an Oscar please. Fassbender was awesome too, I would expect nothing less. Chiwetel Ejiofor did a great Job. It seems his role is uniquely challenging not just because of living and acting out such an emotional part but because he plays an educated man who then dumbs himself down to play a slave, he has to master playing a role within a role. Mcqueen makes a masterpiece, pulling out many well thought out scenes. He delivers maxim effect from shot to shot. Some scenes say so much, explaining what he is trying to get across even when there is no dialogue. This movie will give you the opportunity to be shocked, cry, smile and empathise. The viewers at the cinema I watched it in gave a brief ovation when it was over. This move reminded me of what man can be capable of. I am talking about negative capabilities and I am talking about positive capabilities despite negative treatment. The word negative is barely the tip of the iceberg in terms of a description of slavery, as is this glimpse into slavery told through the story of Solomon Northrop. Every painful and beautiful moment stirred thoughts in my mind. Some thoughts wider than the scope of this move. I was able to reflect of the world we live in now which is still full of its own forms of slavery in this modern age. I reviewed my understanding of man's accomplishments and recognised that we still have a long way to go. I am thankful to those that sacrificed and died to help bring slavery to an end allowing my life to be better than theirs. It is our tern to build on those advancements so that freedom continues and improves for those that will live after us. I happen to be mixed race. 50% White and 50% black. I have carefully stayed away from writing anything that could seem pro one race or another because for me this film is not about colour simply injustice. I would like to finish by acknowledging the excellent job done by all those involved in making this film. Thank you"

"alan-chan-158-451491","10","1","4","12 January 2014"," A cinematic masterpiece destined to be regarded as a modern classic.
","There is a scene in the film when a Louisana plantation owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), confronts one of his slaves, Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), about her disappearance. Despite her entreaties to explain her brief absence she is subjected to a whipping. As the lash flays the flesh from her back members of the audience gasp, some whimper, others cry silently, but all recoil back into their seat horrifyingly transfixed by the terror of the scene, as each crack of the whip spills forth a fine spray of blood. The whole scene is the dark heart of the film and indeed, the heart of darkness of the American slave trade. It is also the most powerful scene in thirty years of filmmaking in a film that is simply a masterpiece and destined to be regarded as a modern classic.<br/><br/>Therein lies a dichotomy because cinema is about entertainment and 12 Years a Slave is a gruelling watch – a harrowing, unflinching, unsentimental and absorbing examination of the barbarity of slavery. It is emotionally draining and not a film to be viewed for an evening's entertainment, light or otherwise. The director, Steve McQueen, first came to prominence in 1999 when he beat out Tracey Emin to win the Turner Prize and like his artwork, his three films so far – Hunger, Shame, 12 Years a Slave – reflect the same clarity of vision, emotional intensity and economy of thought. 12 Years a Slave is set up as a grim story of survival, the mood is sombre, the tone is dark and the music (Hans Zimmer's 'Time' from Inception) is perfectly suited to a piece that is a metaphor for a journey in hell.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, a freeman living in Saratoga, upstate New York in 1841 when he is persuaded to work for a travelling music show in Washington DC and then kidnapped and sold into slavery after a drunken night out. First into the relatively benign hands of a minister, William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), and then onto a drunken and violent plantation owner, Edwin Epps. This is where the film differs slightly from Northup's autobiographical account of the same name, because he had a second owner, John Tibeats, an irrational and violent man who nearly killed Northup on more than one occasion. Epps was his third owner but in the film, for the sake of economy, Tibeats is portrayed as William Ford's weasely carpenter (Paul Dano). This is the only detail in the film that differs from the book and astonishingly, the power of the scene in which Patsey is whipped has been diluted by the director, because Northup reports on brine being poured onto her back afterwards – a scene of suffering which even modern audiences would have found too hard to watch.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen is ably served by a fantastic cast and special mentions must be given to Sarah Paulson who plays the pitiless Mistress Epps, Lupita Nyong'O (Patsey) and above all, Michael Fassbender, who brings Edwin Epps to demonic life – a man who is a violent and sadistic bully – whose self loathing, rage and madness is agitated by his lust and abominable treatment of Patsey. A slew of awards including the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor surely beckon for Fassbender and both Ejiofor and Nyong'o will be strongly in the running for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. Ejiofor effectively portrays the grim determination and quiet dignity of a man struggling to keep hold of his sanity in order to survive his hellish nightmare, and his sense of discombobulation early in the film is palpable. Nyong'o is the touchstone upon which the cruelties, helplessness and capricious nature of slavery are revealed and you will be left wondering about Patsey's fate at the end credits. Sadly, you will be left disappointed consigned as a footnote in history. Both actors deserve the highest recognition for their work.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is the best film ever made about slavery and retrospect has shown that it needed a non-American to make it to avoid the mawkish, reverential and over-sentimental sensibilities that would have weighed the film down if say, Steven Spielberg, had made it (consider 'Amistad' as a case in point). The slave narrative has had a long and proud history in the canon of black literature from 'The Life of William Grimes' to 'The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano' to works by Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs and Harriet Beecher Stowe; even Margaret Mitchell's blockbuster book, 'Gone with the Wind', has slavery as its context although it is a shameless apologia to it and literally whitewashes the issue from its pages. I found it personally astonishing then that I had not heard of Solomon Northup's memoire before the film. The historians Sue Eakin and David Fiske have researched and verified the details of Northup's life and the minutiae of plantation slavery in his story, so there is no doubt that his ghost written autobiography is a truthful and accurate account of his ordeal. The film's veracity and honesty is a stark reminder that in America, the issue of slavery must be examined in all its excoriating and shameful detail in the light of day. My, and presumably, many people's ignorance of Northup's story is testimony to the fact that not enough is known or done about revealing the full history of slavery and the unfettered horrors, injustices and brutalities of the Atlantic Slave Trade. 12 Years a Slave is the best film ever made about slavery but there is no real competition to compare it to. The dearth of films about this subject is something that Hollywood should and needs to address. There are a million stories out there to be told. At the very least, it needs to make up for the racist and fallacious diatribe that was D.W. Griffith's 1915 'Birth of a Nation'."

","12 Years a Slave is Steve McQueen's latest movie, based on the movie's main character Solomon Northup's book of the same name. As the title suggests, it's a movie about slavery in the US, in the mid-1800s. Some people ask, why do we need another movie about slavery? We already know all there is to know about this subject! Well, I might be the only one, but this movie showed me at least one thing I didn't know used to happen – and that is the kidnapping of free black man, to be sold as slaves.<br/><br/>Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is an educated, free black man who lives in the 1841 Saratoga, New York, with his wife and two children, and plays the violin for a living. Two white man approach him one day, offering him a job: he accepts, and after he's done, the two men take him out to dinner to celebrate his good work. He gets drunk and feels sick, so the two carry him back to the hotel and put him to bed – but in the morning, he finds himself in a barn, chained, and realising he can't remember how he got there. A white man soon informs him that he's a slave who will soon be taken to the South and sold.<br/><br/>No matter the fact that you already know the life and suffering of black slaves in the States, 12 Years a Slave will still manage to shock and surprise you – starting from the kidnapping and stealing of Solomon's free papers, up to the horrid life and working conditions in cotton plantations. Chiwetel Ejiofor leads the movie masterfully: in the few scenes with his family in the beginning, it's easy to see that he loves his wife and kids very much; in the later scenes, when he doesn't accept the state he's been brought in and is therefore punished by his owners, we understand, better than ever, how hard it actually is for every human being to be forced into slavery; in his isolation from other slaves, we realise how different he is from them, because he never gives up the hope of some day being saved.<br/><br/>While Chiwetel Ejiofor obviously leads the story, the supporting characters are wonderful and complete him in such a way, that this movie can be compared to a beautiful painting, or a delicious dish – everyone does his part and everyone is important. Benedict Cumberbatch is great in portraying Ford, the ""good slave owner"" – if there ever was such a thing – who forms a nice relationship with Solomon but has to sell him eventually. Michael Fassbender is one of the best, if not the best villain I've seen this year: simply the presence of his character, Edwin Epps, is extremely intimidating, and the way he treats his slaves makes you wish you could personally enter the movie to strangle him. Add to all of this the beautiful and occasionally shocking cinematography, and the wonderful songs the slaves sing while working, and you get one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"

Those that are poisoned by such greed that they would rob people of their dignity are diseased and must be recognized as such.<br/><br/>I am grateful that this movie was made at this time.

"nessa6119","10","1","4","3 December 2013"," 12 Years A Slave
","12 Years A Slave was an extremely touching and inspirational movie. It definitely had a huge impact about the way I view slavery. This character Solomon was a man who was once free, but unfortunately due to sneaky and evil people he was sold back into slavery. I have never seen a movie based on a man who was a slave turned free man. Throughout the movie you see how he was living the good life with his wife and two kids, then things took a quick turn once he decided to go have dinner with these two men he thought were artists. They get him drunk to lure him into a cave like place. Eventually he gets sold to different people. He has many owners, until finally he met this one man who wrote a letter saying that a free man was being enslaved. Eventually he was able to be freed once again after several years of being a slave. The struggle that this man had to put up with was extremely heartbreaking Him and the rest of the slaves that were there. The way they were treated like property instead of actual human beings. The way they were whipped and had to endure scars from those lashes that would lasted forever. Overall my review on this movie is that it is definitely a must see. An extremely inspirational, tragic, and heartbreaking tale of a man who suffered so much injustice. Currently I am taking a Pan African course in school, and this movie actually reminded me of the first reading we had to read in class. There was a speech made my Henry Highland Garnett The National Negro Convention in which he encourages the slaves to take fight since they out number the owners. There was a line in the movie when Solomon was on the ship and one of the men on there told him they need to get together and retaliate and fight. As soon as he said that it made me think of that speech Garnett said to the slaves. It was very difficult for them to rebel during this particular time, but it was definitely something they tried to do, and most times did not succeed since more people were against them than for them. Oh and I must admit right after the movie I went to go buy the book, that is how good the movie was. I definitely didn't think I would be doing that. That concludes my review.."
"JackBateman","10","1","4","3 December 2013"," Horrifying but not without cause
","""12 Years A Slave"" is horrifying but not without cause. The film drives on it's sense of hopelessness and despair without letting the audience be blinded by it. Underneath all of the treachery there is thought provoking yet silent commentary delivered by a mix of emotional acting, score and well thought out pacing. This film places it's viewers in a harsh and realistic adaptation of 1850's America and reveals to it the stinging reality of race inequality and prejudice that was sewn into the culture of the time. One of the things that really helps sell the time period is the phenomenal performances given by the lead and supporting cast. Whether it be the overwhelmingly sad yet subtle acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor, the tyrannical insanity shown by Michael Fassbender or the sometimes unexpected range of Cumberbatch, Giamatti, Dano and many other actors makes everything feel authentic and uninhibited. All of this is set up against the backdrop of a beautiful score that, though simple, can manage to instill you with bursts of unbridled dread or overwhelming feelings of sorrow, it manages this without ever getting in the way of the storytelling. The music plays when it feels right and doesn't when it's not needed. The cinematography is fantastic. Using the lush natural environment as a transition between scenes is often very impactful due to the settings lack of conflict in a rather violent world set up for us by the filmmaker. There are many scenes which linger for a very long time forcing you to take in and contemplate what just happened, paving the way for larger emotional effect in following events, many of these scenes mainly focus on the turmoil of the protagonist in nearly complete silence even if these moments aren't very vicious or adrenaline inducing, they still exude a feeling of faint suspense while building an empathetic connection between the audience and the lead character. In conclusion, though this movie may be brutal, unforgiving and heart breaking there is an underlying beauty, sincerity and hopefulness that make this film one of the most thoughtful, eye opening and important films made in recent memory. this is a motion picture you simply must experience."

","A chilling story about American Slavery. Excellent performances and sets. I would have given it ten stars but as ghastly and graphic the film is it does not approach the book in the horror of American slavery. I'm not saying they should have made it closer to the book which was stomach churning and audiences have limits to what they can handle but since they didn't I'm downgrading the movie a little. Be prepared to be repelled by what you see. I was prepared, having read the book and studied this period, but my daughter was not. She cried in the car afterwards. She had no idea how brutal these subhumans actually were with their casual cruelties and dehumanizing treatment of helpless humans caught in a nightmare from which there was no escape. Lincoln saved a nation from a stain on its soul that will take generations to eradicate. Part of the horror for me is there are still people out there who celebrate this period of American history.

","It has been 16 hours since the end credits of 12 Years a Slave started scrolling, and I have yet to recuperate from this miraculous, horrifying, brutal film. I am not ashamed to admit that I cried several times throughout this movie, and every time I think about Solomon's story I start to sniffle a little bit. This film is a masterpiece. There's no other word to describe it. Simply a masterpiece. Not only is it the best film of the year, but it's arguably one of the best films ever made. Right up there with Schindler's LIst. The way this story is told, the brutality of it all, is mortifying. And yet, despite all the horror that is portrayed on the screen, I can call this film beautiful. It was so well shot, so well edited, so well acted, so well directed...it was simply, in a word, flawless. As an avid film-goer, I often watch films like this analytically and try to tear them apart and find every flaw I can. But I couldn't find one single flaw with this film. Some may argue that some shots lasted too long, but no. These shots were just meant to make you feel like an accomplice. For example, there is an excruciatingly long scene (I say excruciatingly not because it's bad, but because it's hard to watch), where Solomon is hung from a tree with his toes barely touching the ground, and if his feet leave the ground, you know he will choke and die. We see his struggle from every perspective. Close up, wide, medium, POV, OTS, everything. And every time, in the background, we see people meandering by, as if this were just a normal day on the plantation. People would argue that this scene could have been cut, but I say no. It had to be that long, because it makes you as a modern viewer want to jump up and help him, even though you know you can't do anything. That's what being on a plantation felt like. You wanted to help him, but you knew that wouldn't do anything. 12 Years a Slave is not for the faint of heart. It's a horrifying testament to what America once was, and how man used to treat fellow man. I would advise you to bring a tissue box and prepare to weep several times. It's easily the best film of the year and most definitely the Schindler's List of our generation."

","12 Years a Slave is that movie that I hear is currently the front runner for best picture of the year at the Academy Awards. I thought my expectations were to high going in to this movie, and that I might leave the theater disappointed, and I did end up a little disappointed when the movie ended. The cast is huge, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is the main lead, while Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender deserve special mentions. Many people will probably enjoy this film better than I did, but as a current student of American history, I did not find the violence to be very shocking or powerful to me. <br/><br/>In case you don't already know, the movie is about a free black man in New York who is kidnapped and sold into slavery for 12 years. This is by no means a bad movie, as a matter of fact, the good strongly outweighs the bad. First of all, the directing is excellent. There were many shots that stuck with me, but there are two in particular I would like to mention. There is one scene where Ejiofor's character is chained in a dungeon screaming for help, and the camera slowly moves up to reveal that he is close to the White House. I thought this was an excellent commentary on how political leaders made this legal in America. The second shot was where it shows Ejiofor's character struggling to survive a hanging for several minuets, which I thought was extremely well done. Also, the acting was beyond astounding, especially from Cumberbatch and Fassbender. Both of them should win Oscars, but sadly only one will. <br/><br/>It is also important to mention that many viewers found the violence in the movie to be sickening, brutal, and devastating, and not always in a good way. This makes the movie very controversial. Luckily for me, I am very desensitized to violence in movie, and I could handle everything the movie threw at me. I also found that the movie started to get a little boring half way through, which was depressing because The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby was over 3 hours about a relationship, and this movie was still more boring. The movie overall was pretty much just a bunch of bad things that were done to slaves, and then it was over. See this movie in theaters, because even though I found it pretty boring, the movie still gets a rating of 8.1/10 stars for being an excellently directed and acted picture, if not a fun one."

","This movie is one of the most remarkable I have seen in recent times. Slavery is a theme that has been approached in cinema, giving rise to such grandiose films as, for example, ""Amistad"", a film with which we can make comparisons, since both are close: they approach the same theme from a similar perspective, situate Its history roughly the same time and both start from true stories. However, this film has the added beauty of showing us the cruelty to which a slave was subjected by its owners. And I say the word beauty because we sometimes need to see in order to understand. From this point of view, this film, based on the memoirs of Solomon himself, is an interesting document that allows us to understand the history, the past, the cruelty of those acts. Needless to say, I loved the story and I think the script is great. I do not know to what extent he is faithful to the book, but it seems quite true to reality, to what really happened then. The sets and costumes were also well made and reliable. Chiwetel Ejiofor gave life to the main character and filled the screen with feelings, nostalgia, anguish and pungent pain, in an excellent interpretation. Dickie Gravois is the name, I think, of the actor who plays the foreman of the last plantation where Solomon worked, and I must congratulate this actor as he has made his character truly worthy of our hatred.<br/><br/>This is a precious film that hardly makes anyone indifferent. It is not for everyone. Children should not watch. It has some nudity and especially violence, which is needed in such a film. It's worth watching."

One morning he wakes up in chains and everything changes. This is the true story of Solomon Northup based on his biography of the same name. After being freed he campaigned to have the kidnappers jailed but the trial collapsed. Solomon disappeared 4 years after he was freed and nobody knows where he went to and where he is buried. Steve MacQueen, the director, managed to give us a lecture about how bad the conditions were for black people at that time.

","'Twelve Years a Slave' is a tightly written, well-crafted film that further explores Ingmar Bergman's assertion that Film has nothing to do with Literature, but shares greater affinities with Painting, Music and Photography. The film itself is beautiful to look at; owing to its Director Steve McQueen and its Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt as well as its Film Editor Joe Walker. While others I talked to found the film 'brutal', I found it remarkably restrained and its narrative compelling without being driven by the roller-coaster pyrotechnics of films post Indiana Jones. The film explores a set of issues with intelligence albeit going down a well-trodden road. The Three Laws of Fred Williamson are applied here for once with a subtle sophistication and a hint of profound implication rarely to be seen during the Blaxploitation Era.<br/><br/>The subject matter being as fulsome as it is, I was not exactly foaming at the mouth to see this one. After all, nobody needed to tell me who would be playing the Masters and who would be playing the Slaves. Just as toy dogs fly well when kicked, African Americans and sundry other people of color make great victims to pivot the story around in films such as 'Spartacus' and 'The Sting'. Here in a culture that glories in violence and falls in love so easily with death projected on the silver screen, Blacks make excellent fodder for the pigs in the slaughterhouse.<br/><br/>While I was watching 'Twelve Years a Slave', my mischievous imagination started itching me. There must be a parallel universe somewhere, I figured, where Blacks were herding Whites into waiting ships to be sent to distant lands and auctioned off for their strength, beauty and utility in a thousand and one ways as well as to be a supplementary source of energy more valuable than coal or oil. However, this was not to be that story, and 'Twelve Years a Slave' hews pretty close to the formula for this kind of fare.<br/><br/>The twist here is that Solomon Northrup starts out a free man privy to all the amenities of his times. That is before someone can whisper in his ear that the white man speaks with a forked tongue and he then finds himself waking up in chains. This turn of events comes after a night of revelry with new-found friends, who, unbeknownst to Northrup, are looking for another slave to log into the books. At this point, the gate begins to swing wide on the horrors of the antebellum South.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor's Solomon Northrup is a gifted and intelligent man able to postulate his own solutions to many problems and this becomes apparent throughout the narrative. But here in Slave Country his skills and talents win him no reward or empowerment, simply the inverse of such phenomena. This is heart-wrenching to watch and makes you want to grab something hard to hit somebody with. It is the age-old conundrum. How do you reason with someone who simply wants to control and dominate you for the thrill and empowering pleasure of it? Is feeling superior to someone or something really that valuable an experience?<br/><br/>Discuss amongst yourselves.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most troubling character is Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey. She is a woman born and bred into slavery. You see her producing two to two and a half times as much product picking cotton as any of the other slaves male or female. Today she would probably be working her way up the ladder to running her own company and eventually rubbing elbows with Oprah Winfrey. But here in this cultural context, her exceptional production wins her abuse, disfigurement and mutilation and the choice between cultural murder of the spirit and the body by degrees at the hands of slave owners or the death wish of the suicide.<br/><br/>I'll have to admit I was glad she won an Oscar for such an anguishing and haunting portrayal.<br/><br/>The flashbacks to Northrup's life prior to slavery are musically handled and the scene at the end of Northrup meditating upon his misery is one of the best interior monologues I have seen in Cinema. The cast is well rounded out with veterans like Alfre Woodard, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson and Paul Dano holding down supporting roles. Until that film comes out where whites are walking in chains seething with self hatred, I'll have to tip my hat to the elevated craft of 'Twelve Years a Slave'.<br/><br/>There are three additional thoughts of note that have come to mind. While I do not plan to be doing any slave owning any time soon, it seems to me Patsey's 'owners' might have been curious as to how she was outproducing all the other slaves in her party. Could it be possible she was using advanced techniques that could be shared with her other brethren, or was she simply exercising a higher level of manual dexterity due to her gender? The other thing that came to mind is that I was finally convinced due to the meditative quality of this film that the great Carter G. Woodson was right. The African mind is essentially an Oriental mind. Finally, it seems to me that 'Twelve Years a Slave' can be seen as a darker (no pun intended) version of 'Sullivan Travels'.<br/><br/>But, unlike the Butler in 'Sullivan's Travels', I do not advise you to shun the subject of slavery even for the purposes of study."

","A heavy, powerful watch if not in any way an enjoyable one. Similar to Schindler's List in a way, in that it's important material that's well-acted and deeply moving, but also very tough to get through in places. That comparison isn't completely fair, of course. Though Chiwetel Ejiofor serves well in the leading role and Lupita Nyong'o is memorable (if one-note) in support, there is no Liam Neeson-level central performance in this picture and the cast very quickly falls into camps of good and evil with little middle ground. Michael Fassbender fares best as the deeply troubled alcoholic slave-owner Epps, but he's present largely to be despised and as such his character lacks a thorough inspection. The other name actors, shoehorned in as bit roles, only serve to distract. We can slap an Amish beard on Brad Pitt and throw him onto a plantation, but it's still Brad Pitt in those suspenders and there's no getting around that. Well shot and expertly directed, it hammers predictably on the same point from start to finish. This is meaningful, often chilling work, but not something I'm going to feel compelled to revisit in the very near future."

","Based on the book by the same name penned by Solomon Northup whose biographical date is important to note: Born a free man in New York, Northup was drugged and kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery there. He was soon taken with other slaves by ship to New Orleans and sold into further slavery. He eventually came into contact with a Canadian abolitionist, who was able to notify his family of his whereabouts. In 1853, after the intervention of an official agent of the state of New York, he was freed. He filed charges against his kidnappers but after a long trial, the charges were dropped on legal technicalities and Northup was never compensated for his years in slavery. He orally related his story to a New York legislator, David Wilson, who published it in a book titled '12 Years A Slave.' The book was published less than a year after Northup's freedom and it sold over 30,000 copies. He is believed to have died in 1863. The original book was transformed into a screenplay by Ridley Scott for the Cinematic version directed by Steve McQueen.<br/><br/>The incredible true story of one man's fight for survival and freedom is disturbing to see and is a fine reminder of the horrors of man's inhumanity to man – slavery – that still exists today. In the pre-Civil War United States, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery. Facing cruelty (personified by a malevolent slave owner, portrayed by Michael Fassbender), as well as unexpected kindnesses, Solomon struggles not only to stay alive, but to retain his dignity. In the twelfth year of his unforgettable odyssey, Solomon's chance meeting with a Canadian abolitionist (Brad Pitt) will forever alter his life. The significant polar roles between evil and good are well played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Liza j. Bennet, Sarah Paulson, Lupita Nyong'o, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Garret Dillahunt among a cast of thousands.<br/><br/>The film is overly long, dwells on only the brutality to slaves, and fails to give us background on the most important characters – especially Solomon Northup. It is a very dark song, necessary to remand the world of the crime of slavery, but lacking in moments of light that allow the audience see the history clearly and to make the arc of the story more dramatic. Both Chiwetel Ejiofor ('I don't want to survive. I want to live') and Michael Fassbender are excellent. Grady Harp, March 14"
"classicsoncall","9","1","5","2 March 2014"," ""It's a fact, a plain and simple fact, that what is true and right is true and right for all.""
","Well tonight is Oscar night as I write this, and this picture will likely garner it's share of awards. It deserves it's accolades, but I have to say, it's tough picture to watch at times. The whipping scenes in particular are extremely brutal, and just as in ""The Passion of the Christ"", I have to wonder if any person's human body can stand up to that type of torture. It's too graphic even for words, and rending another person's flesh as depicted seems almost incomprehensible.<br/><br/>Which is the point I guess. The brutality of slavery is on display here in all it's horror, and in today's politically charged climate, this makes for exceptional Oscar fodder. Too bad it were not otherwise. The film could probably win on it's own merits without the politics of the Academy involved, and if it does win Best Picture, who will know for sure? Of course this all a few hours before the fact, so in a little while I guess all the guessing games can begin.<br/><br/>As well as the picture itself, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o are solid contenders for their respective categories. The scene where Patsey begs Solomon to end her misery was a standout for me, and spoke to the unbearable circumstances so often associated with slavery and it's horrors. Again, a tough picture to watch, but probably an important one if it helps bridge the atrocities of a past century with healing instead of divisiveness."

","12 Years a Slave, the new film by British director Steve McQueen is the latest in a series of filmic treatment of slavery, one of the darkest chapters in US history. After Quentin Tarantino's revenge tale Django Unchained and Lincoln, Steven Spielberg's political drama about slavery's official abolition, it leads us into the heart of human degradation and cruelty, and to the core of an American trauma that has not been properly dealt with in the past, that still lingers in all the unsolved issues plaguing US society today. Perhaps now the time is right. For the first time in history, a black man is holding the highest office in the land, living proof how far the country has come. A look at America today, however, shoes the long distance still ahead and maybe a film like 12 Years a Slave can serve as a reminder that the wounds that the system of treating humans as things, extending the principle of property to living souls, has created have not healed.<br/><br/>The film opens with a series of seemingly disconnected images: a group of slaves standing motionless in a field; a man and a woman turning towards each other in the night, a man in shackles. Not a word is spoken, past and present indistinguishable, a human life reduced to brief glimpses. 12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a father of two and skilled violinist, a respected member of the community of Saratoga Springs in upstate New York. He gets lured to Washington, DC, under a pretense, is kidnapped and sold as a slave to Louisiana. He first works for a relatively humane slaver before he, following a confrontation with his chief carpenter, is sold to a brutal and sadistic new ""master"". Only after twelve years he can, with much luck and help from his home community, regain his freedom. A rare exception that allows him to tell a story he shares with many but which most never lived to tell.<br/><br/>In other directors' hands, 12 Years a Slave might have turned into a sentimental, pathos drenched melodrama, drowning in a heavy musical score, driven by high drama and overblown emotions. Steve McQueen, a rising star among Hollywood directors, however, tells the story in an equally poetic as well as serious, unsentimental, unsparing way, accompanied by a surprisingly unassuming score by Hans Zimmer, that remains close to the protagonist throughout, that sets out to tell his unique story and to reach the universal strictly through the individual. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Solomon a man robbed of his life, his identity, his name, even his right to call himself human. His acting is subtle, as he moves from defiance through pragmatic survival to all the deformations this de-humanization enforces on body and soul. He is no hero but a man who wants to live, one who tries to stay low, who even allows to become an instrument of suppression only not to be its target.<br/><br/>McQueen rolls past and present into one, juxtaposes strikingly beautiful images of the Southern countryside with extreme and very graphic cruelty, continues a cynical racist song into the next scene when the seemingly kind master preaches from the bible, contrasts the everyday with the inhumane as in a long scene in which Solomon, following an interrupted hanging remains for hours dangling from the rope, his feet just touching the ground and groping to keep the body up, while in the background children play. In this world, normal life and the loss of all basic principles of humaneness are one, as are beauty and the turning of humans into objects, an upside down world in which time has stopped, an eternity of suffering in which past and present are the same because there is no future. But as much as these people are forced to play their roles, they cannot help but remain humans with their very own hopes and fears and characters and personalities. An involuntary defiance that is almost harder to bear for the oppressors as outright rebellion would be. Michael Fassbender is Ejiofor's counterpart, a sadistic slaveholder with no hint of true human feelings, yet a soul even more deformed by this unnatural economy that those of his victims. The agent of terror is no free man either, tortured by demons stronger than any whip. But there is no excuse, as haunted as he is, he remains culpable without limitation.<br/><br/>McQueen describes without excusing. No-one gets out of this unharmed, the coming home scene in which Solomon apologizes to his wife for his appearance is starkly shocking. The film's great strength is the combination of complex and poetic storytelling and relentless honesty, making it a poem of human suffering as well as a stark and relentless portrait of what man can do to man. And he does so by telling one man's story, the tale of an individual body and soul, a flawed human being who stands for himself – and through that for millions of others.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the film has its faults. Brad Pitt as the only good white man is unbearably bland, occasionally the film cannot avoid the trap of drifting into tear jerking territory, and even a little patronizing is not absent – after all, Solomon's freeing is the work of white men – but these are very minor flaws in what is otherwise a deeply disturbing, uncompromisingly honest depiction of humanity at its cruelest. When the academy Awards are handed out in late February, 13 Years a Slave is widely expected to be named ""Best Picture"". There hasn't been a more deserving winner in years.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"

","Hard to believe this story has not been shown in movies up to this date. A true story of a free man taken in to slavery and eventually escaping! A moving story, well played by all involved. The main actors are brilliant unknowns and the Director - Steve McQueen - has just captured my future attention. Brad Pitt even appears without his usual spastic moves. This movie is perhaps more worthy than Roots as the best depiction of the broken humanity that slavery caused. My odds-on favorite for several Oscars. One weak point - and I'm not sure if this is in the book: the ease which the main character appears to be 'captured'.

","Despite its relentlessly violent and disturbing content, the film is a must watch. The beauty of a film titled 12 Years A Slave, is it's straightforwardness and self-aware narration. Like so many movies before it, this remarkable tale of Solomon Northup's unbelievable journey of survival, may not be familiar from the character names, but the story shares many narrative arcs of other slavery driven melodramas. Fortunately for us, 12 Years a Slave breaks its cliché stigma thanks simply to one of the greatest living directors working today, Steve McQueen. McQueen, an enigmatic British story teller, has had indie success since his riveting Hunger and more importantly, the sadly overlooked Shame. Having an incredible visual understanding as well as dramatically perverse eye, McQueen captures an unapologetic and extraordinary film of the tackle of evil, and the eventual glory of justice.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is a film based heavily off of Solomon Northup's memoir Twelve Years A Slave. Gestating from Solomon's life as an acclaimed violinist, to the cruel unwilling insertion of Solomon to slavery in the Deep South, the film takes very little liberties of Northup's brave literary piece. Chronicling Solomon's decade plus of slavery, from plantation overseers to slave owners, and all the people that he meets in-between, Northup the man, and the character, is truly a testament to the extent of the human spirt and the marvel of selfishness and tolerance.<br/><br/>Slavery is a subject that cannot be ignored when flipping through the pages of history books, especially American history. As sad as it is to admit, slavery is just as much a part of learning of the past as glory and success is. The thing about the subject of slavery when it comes to the film medium is that audiences already know what to expect; lashings, whippings, lynching, sexual and physical abuse, injustice and unexplainable cruelty. The difference between knowing these facts and seeing them on the screen, is the emotional response the poetic visuals provide. Like any spectacular painting, this moving piece of art is like any paint-to-canvas product, more stunning and hypnotizing the longer you stare at it.<br/><br/>Many could argue that 12 Years A Slave is an overly dramatized, artsy recantation of a man's struggle to freedom. From grueling, neck-breaking long takes, to several extreme close ups, to musically laden chants, the film is a fine piece of cinematic showcasing for its director and many talented individuals involved. 12 Years A Slave is, without a doubt, McQueen's most commercial work. But do not get discouraged, because unlike so many talented directors in the past to substitute commercial success with artificial, flaky pieces of cinema, McQueen uses his talent to attract one of the film's most talented qualities, its cast.<br/><br/>Unflinching and naturally statuesque is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who will no doubt get some Oscar recognition, and perhaps even a win for his enslaving portrayal of Solomon Northup. Ejiofor inhabits a passion of previous confident actors in his role as Northup similar to that of Poiteir, Washington and Redford. From the start of McQueen's body of work, one of the most noticeable and gratifying similarity all three lead males share, is the control and power of their gaze. From Michael Fassbender in Hunger and Shame, and now to Ejiofor in 12 Years, Ejiofor and McQueen create a fiery, personal relationship of gazes and stares that act as another character for audience members to empathize with. Whether it be on a train, hungrily undressing a redhead in the opening scene of Shame, to a hopeful yet empty stare into the humid swamps of the South, it is in these simplistic stares and silent revelations where we weep, we cry, and we feel an immense sorrow for a man stripped of everything.<br/><br/>Along with Ejiofor and also destined for Oscar recognition is Lupita Nyong'o. Accepting and willing to succumb to death rather than live a life of slavey and the apple of her owner Edwin Epps' (Michael Fassbender) affection, Nyong'o delivers in a way that could only be best described as classical and timeless; a way that only Jane Eyre enthusiasts could comprehend.<br/><br/>Sharing in the glory of McQueen's amazing ability to retrieve the best performances from his actors, are of course, Michael Fassbender, frequent collaborator and McQueen's muse, as the epitome of evil Edwin Epps; to Paul Giamatti as the inhumane slave merchant; to Benedict Cumberbatch as the remorseful Master Ford; to Scoot McNairy as the deceitful Mr. Brown; to the always brilliant Paul Dano as the crippling Mr. Tibeats, and of course the ingenious Brad Pitt as the heroic Canadian carpenter Mr. Bass, this film will serve as a definite fine point in all the careers of these already talented acting forces.<br/><br/>12 Years A Slave is all around, a solid example of the fine points of collaboration. John Ridely's script is a brilliant literary work that excels most during the lyrical and doomed dialogues between slaves. Composer Hans Zimmer orchestrates a chilling score that, at moments, gives hope, and at other times, deepens one's sorrow. The film is a great, big authoritative film of the finest artists working in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Chances are, 12 Years A Slave will chill your warm heart and bury any previous empathy for the slaves in Tarantino's Django Unchained into the dirt. There is no silver lining here; McQueen's sprawling slavery epic is a depressing, death-filled account of past reality. In each blood- soaked, flesh-pealing, naturally cinematic scene, McQueen finds the beauty in torture, the art in tragedy and most of all, the passion of perseverance and hope, despite all. 12 Years A Slave will undoubtedly be one of my favourite films of the year. And rest assured, once its hold loosens and the chains drop, 12 Years A Slave will survive as one of the year's most memorable stories of hope, and will live on to be a modern American classic.<br/><br/>Night Film Reviews: 10/10 Stars."

","""12 Years A Slave"",is a true story based on a book written by Solomon Northup a ""free negro"" born in New York State in the early 1800's. The director of this film, Steve McQueen"" is also black. Perhaps one day there will no need to distinguish him professionally based on his race but I think it's necessary this time. If only we could look upon art for its own sake, not by the race of the person who wrote or directed it, but this time I believe it's necessary. Like only Elie Wiesel, a holocaust survivor, could have written ""Night"", only Steve McQueen could have directed this film. This film strips away anything that is cosmetic and shows, I believe, slavery as it really was, through constant brutality, you strip away anyone of their high-held beliefs in justice, and most importantly of all of our individual sense of right and wrong.<br/><br/>I think this film is a masterpiece, based on what I believe is true art: a true representation of the both the brutality and the humanity of us all. I watched this film with my husband, who is African American, he watched it in stoic silence. I was in tears. The profound difference with my reaction compared to his was so layered. His reaction is one coming from a deep well of oppression, going back to over 300 years. Passed on from generation to generation. My husband is a profoundly compassionate man, it was based on my urgings that he saw this film. Now I'm not sure so sure I should have subjected him to it. But perhaps his stoicism is something I, as a white person, will never understand. Some of the scenes were so difficult to watch, (oh, yeah? Difficult to watch? Trying living through them in real life) How desensitized these children were made to be. The scene in which Solomon was forced to whip ""Patsy"" a fellow slave was almost unbearable to watch. But perhaps what was worse was the scene in which Solomon, having a promise of freedom, is forced to leave Patsy behind on the plantation. I wonder what I would have done under similar circumstances, what I would have endured rather than being forced to betray a loved one. Big questions. And I guess we all hold the answers in our individual hearts"
"CEBaum","8","1","6","6 November 2013"," 12 Years a Slave's triumphs do more than make up for failures
","12 Years a Slave is a film that rights itself so powerfully that it manages to meet, and possibly surpass, its overwhelming hype.<br/><br/>When a movie has you doubting its quality for its first half hour, it tends to send up more than a few red flags. That was the experience I had with Steve McQueen's third feature film, 12 Years a Slave. All of the festival hype about this being a masterpiece didn't even seem remotely present. Yet over the course of its grueling duration, the movie has a way of getting under your skin long before you fully realize it.<br/><br/>Arriving nearly a year after Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, Slave is quick to position itself as a polar opposite. Tarantino's take on slavery was brutal, but so stylized that it quickly arrived at winking hyperbole. That tongue-in-cheek revisionism is nowhere to be found in McQueen's film, which sternly cements itself as one of the definitive cinematic portraits of the horrors of American slavery.<br/><br/>Yet for all of the brutality, emotional and physical, on display, 12 Years a Slave's approach is remarkably restrained. McQueen, working off of John Ridley's adaptation of the novel of the same title, has ample opportunity to bludgeon the viewer into numbing submission. As we follow Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man captured and sold into the southern slavery machine, we are witness to unspeakable violence, as expected. But rather than reflect Northrup's own horror, the film spends most of its time depicting its atrocities with quiet detachment. Rarely has the concept of the banality of evil been so maturely transferred to the silver screen.<br/><br/>The effect is distancing at first, and it can make 12 Years a Slave difficult to fully engage with at times. There are moments made to elicit gasps of horror, but also any number of scenes presented so matter-of-factly that they appear determined to keep the viewer at arm's length. It's a strategy that could have proved damning in the long run. Instead, it all builds to a finale that packs what has to be the biggest emotional wallop of the year, and by quite a wide margin.<br/><br/>The academically rigorous treatment that takes up most of the runtime is, secretly, the key to the film's success. By refusing to indulge in exploitation and wallowing in awfulness, the story clips along, capturing evil as ordinarily as possible, as though it were just another part of the day. The intelligence with which Ridley treats his characters, coupled with McQueen's vision, allow the film to work as an accessibly arty drama, as well as an honest and unflinching portrait of one of the biggest travesties in American history.<br/><br/>And as the glue holding the story together, Mr. Ejiofor is tremendous, infusing Solomon with hope, determination, and despair without mugging. The middle of the story sees Solomon – with a new name, and reduced to little more than a cotton picker – as an observer and occasional victim. Rather than slip into laziness, Ejiofor infuses Solomon's defeated passivity with a tragic grace that only becomes more impressive as time passes.<br/><br/>While Ejiofor carries the movie on his shoulders, he allows his co-stars the bulk of the film's flashier moments. As Mr. and Mrs. Epps, Michael Fassbender and Sarah Paulson make up one of the most despicable, yet frighteningly believable, couples in recent memory. Whatever their quarrels with each other, they have no problem abusing and manipulating the slaves as a means of attacking each other. As Mr. Epps watches, with mocking delight, his slaves dance, his wife catches him eying young Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o, also excellent). Her retaliation is to pick up a glass decanter and toss it at the girl's head, with all of the effort of tossing paper into a waste bin. It's a moment horrifying for its basic cruelty, the chillingly casual manner of its depiction, and implications it has about the Epps' world views. That the moment lasts but 10 seconds only magnifies the scene's blunt force.<br/><br/>At this point it almost seems pointless to point out the films flaws, considering how contained they are to the beginning of the movie. However, though the initial missteps don't undercut the power of the conclusion, they do start the film off in a puzzling manner that feels at odds with what follows.<br/><br/>Rather than proceed in strictly linear fashion, the opening begins with a few vignettes of Solomon already on the Epps' plantation. Later, the film inserts brief flashbacks to Northrup's time with his wife and two children as they go about their life as free and respected members of society. The ""payoff"" that this structure delivers is little more than a condensed repeat of the opening scenes in a bizarre attempt to generate a moment of psychological tension. Compared with the elegant frankness of the film's majority, these moments can't help but feel rough around the edges. Hans Zimmer's early scoring contributions don't help matters, and threaten to send certain scenes careening off of the rails with their horror movie intensity.<br/><br/>Thankfully, 12 Years a Slave's triumphs do more than make up for its failures. They absolutely demolish them. With all of the accumulated pain and suffering built up over the course of more than two hours, the film arrives at its shattering conclusion. It's an otherworldly combination of hopefulness about the story's end, as well as a cathartic end to a profoundly wrenching journey. McQueen's film could derisively be deemed his broadest and most accessible.

","A real life story of a man who was victim of the society of the times, a world where the color of your skin set you back in the eyes of many, and that allowed passions and injustice to rise to levels so dangerous, even those who knew right from wrong fear to speak up. Imagine what it must have felt for African Americans who were seen by many as the property of the rich, who had no rights, and who lived in constant fear of being killed, abused, or at least treated as a human being of the worst kind.<br/><br/>A ""free"" man is somehow kidnapped and taken back to the South for profit. Once he is outside of the safe haven where he has lived all his life, he has no resources as no one will offer him help of any kind. Soon, the audience become witness to different degrees of torture, abuse, rape, and the mistreatment of this man. He loses his voice and the ability to defend himself for any sort of belligerence and rebellion will result in more unjust punishment.<br/><br/>There are those masters who recognize the evil at the core of the whole concept of slavery, but money rules this world, and as long as these types of contract are produced, the humanity of the slaves disappears. If there is a way to lessen the level of disgrace is to transfer them into a similar type of hell; at least they won't be killed. Here is where the movie excels by presenting the different types of personalities who supported this society: from the coldhearted businessman who sees nothing but dollars to the tortured plantation owner who struggles with his position but does very little to end the situation. Then there is the indifferent types, and the conflicted simpletons who end up in positions of power and are subject to emotional conflicts and mood swings.<br/><br/>The cast is universally top notch, with strong support in the technical areas to evoke an era that has not been gone for too long. We see the recreations of plantations, both inside and outside, the reenactment of atmospheres where lack of tolerance takes a secondary spot to humiliation of the worst type.<br/><br/>You will have a front row seat to lashings and all sorts of unspeakable acts, of peeking at the soul of man in love with a slave and himself a slave of what society offers him: he's the master of his property and the slave of a world he doesn't understand but that he must serve.<br/><br/>The film is a work of art that sometimes asks too much from its audience. It is not perfect but close to it; yet it might be its power that is overwhelming or just a strong reminder of what we are capable to creating, enduring, and that we must struggle to resist and conquer."
"jboothmillard","9","2","22","27 January 2014"," 12 Years a Slave
","I heard about this film during it's release, I knew it had the star of Love Actually and The Shadow Line in it, and then awards season started, this was one of the most nominated, I had to see why, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame). Based on the autobiography of the real man, in the year 1841, Solomon Northup (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man living in the society of Saratoga Springs, New York with his wife Anne Northup (Kelsey Scott) and two children, and he makes a living as a violinist, but his life is snatched from him when two men, Brown (Scoot McNairy) and Hamilton (Taran Killam), take him out of town to what he believes will be a music gig, but he is drugged and chained up. Northup is sold into slavery, given the name of an escaped slave, Platt, and taken to the deep south of New Orleans, upscale but callous slave trader Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) sells him to good-willed plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), the master is kind to let him have a violin. Tension rise between him and racist carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano) who verbally abuses him, to the point when they fight, afterwards Northup endures hours of agony in a noose, Ford sees the only way to save him is to sell him to Edwin Epps (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michael Fassbender), Ford has a debt to pay so cannot listen to his pleas of his identity. Epps is a vicious master, believing he has the right to abuse his slaves according to pro-slavery verses in the Bible, both true and false ones, he encourages the slaves to accept whatever they endure, and they will be beaten unless they pick up to 200 pounds of cotton every day, one slave who is praised lustfully by Epps, picking up to 500 pounds a day, is Patsey (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Lupita Nyong'o), who Northup becomes close friends with as they endure their traumas. Patsey is violently abused by the envious and nasty wife Mistress Epps (Sarah Paulson) at many opportune moments, and Epps himself rapes the girl repeatedly, and Patsey feels so weak and horrified with her situation that she asks Northup to assist her suicide, but he refuses, he meanwhile along with other slaves are leased to a neighbouring plantation due to cotton worms, apparently a godly plague, and there he gains favour from the owner who lets him play his violin at a wedding anniversary celebration and keep his earnings. Northup wants to use his earnings to try and send a message home, he pays white field hand and former overseer Armsby (Garret Dillahunt) to send a letter to his friends in New York, the man takes the money but betrays him, Epps is informed but is just about convinced by Northup that the story is untrue, and he is tearfully forced to burn the letter, his only hope for freedom. Patsey one day goes missing from the plantation, she returns revealing that she was fetching soap as Epps' wife refuses to give her any to clean, and in anger Epps orders her stripped and tied to a tree, the wife encourages her husband to get Northup to whip her, he reluctantly agrees and does so, but Epps takes the whip wanting it done more savagely, and she is lashed until severely wounded and unconscious. While Patsey heals Northup starts building a gazebo with a fellow construction worker, white Canadian carpenter Bass (Brad Pitt, also producing), he is opposed to slavery which displeases Epps, but Northup confides in this man about his kidnapping and formerly being a free man, he once again asks for help sending a letter to New York, and Bass agrees to risk his life and do so. Eventually the local sheriff calls Northup over, he is asked a series of questions based on the letter of facts received, and he instantly recognises the shopkeeper with him, they have come to free him, Epps is angry at his slave being taken and Patsey is devastated to lose her friend, but he is taken away immediately. Having been enslaved for twelve years Northup returns to life as a free man and an emotional reunion with his wife, older children and a grandchild, the end text tells that the law could not convict those who forced Northup into slavery, and also that the details of his death and burial have never been found. Also starring Adepero Oduye as Eliza and Alfre Woodard as Mistress Shaw. Ejiofor is absolutely compelling as the black man who has his life stolen from him as he is forced into slavery, Fassbender is fantastic as the unsympathetic and malicious slave master, Nyong'o is magnificent as the female slave often hideously raped and beaten, and Cumberbatch, Giamatti and Pitt all do their supporting roles very well also. Apart from Django Unchained, this is one of the only films about slavery from the point of view of an enslaved person, the period detail is impeccable, the brutal and shocking material such as constant ""N"" words, torture and violence is poignant, and the emotions of suffering, misery, courage and hope seen throughout truly impress, McQueen is a true perfectionist and this film is absolute must see, a brilliant period drama based on a true story. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Hans Zimmer, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Very good!"
"bobsgrock","Null","1","9","13 November 2013"," A safe bet for audience satisfaction
","12 Years a Slave represents a late-flowering of Hollywood's attempt to continue the white-guilt trip regarding the American slave trade since Roots was an international hit in the 1970s. The exception, however, is that this film is far more superior in its technical qualities than nearly every other of its kind. It begins with the simple yet allegedly powerful statement ""This film is based on a true story."" Whether this is intended to get the audience to sit up and pay extra attention or simply to help prop up a rather deflated synopsis remains a unique element to singular films. Nevertheless, in this case, it seems to add nothing to the terror and brutality exhibited in the rest of the film. Herein lies a great discrepancy for the film's level of satisfaction: does a ""true story"" translate to a more powerful and effective experience, and if so, does this imply that fiction has no relevance left?<br/><br/>All this to say that, despite its misgivings about its audience's ability to absorb information, Steve McQueen's adaptation of Solomon Northupp's memoir of being kidnapped, sold as a slave despite previously being a freeman, and eventually brought back to his rightful position, does strike a powerful and memorable chord. This is helped in large part by the expansive, eclectic and effective cast which includes such diverse names as Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, and Brad Pitt. Yet, what struck me most about this film was the way in which it seemed to be so single-minded in its approach that it failed to see Northupp as a representative of American slavery in the decades prior to the Civil War. This is exhibited most apparently in the finale, which ends rather abruptly without any real sort of coda or satisfying cadence. This may very well be what McQueen intended, but it still diminishes the viewing experience as it limits the audience to experiencing only what Northupp wrote explicitly. In most cases, this would be fine, but the camera's ability to transcend its subjects and expand on its themes almost requires more than what the source material allows. In this sense, the film fails to live up to its billing. <br/><br/>It seems that this was done most likely to keep a safe awareness of its time and place in the box office. This film will most assuredly be a front-runner for the Oscars next year, yet it has the opportunity to go far beyond more conventional or even exploitative tales of slavery such as Mandingo and, to a lesser but more entertaining degree, Django Unchained. McQueen was well on his way to showing the most realistic, truthful and even sympathetic portrayal of the relationship between blacks and whites during the 19th century. It's a shame he seems to pull back and give us a book report just at the moment when more exposition could have benefited greatly."
"tadpole-596-918256","8","1","10","7 November 2013"," This movie and GONE WITH THE WIND can't BOTH be true . . .
",". . . so let's use some common sense to resolve this cinematic contradiction. Tempting as it may be to give the more recent ""history"" of slavery the ""benefit of the doubt,"" this fallacious mode of thinking gives in to the ""tyranny of the NOW."" In WIND, black workers in Georgia get room & board, are generally well treated, and are proud to fight side-by-side with their white owners to perpetuate the only civilization they've ever known during the U.S. Civil War. In 12, on the other hand, Peach State slaves frequently demean each other with the ""N-word,"" are mercilessly raped and flogged, and cower on run-down plantations devoid of ballroom dancing. Which of these pictures is more accurate: WIND's or 12's? WIND's vision, in which Blacks work patiently toward a better tomorrow, was given the Best Picture Oscar for 1939--a distinction that is re-validated each year it is not revoked (not to mention the fact that WIND set all-time box office records). In today's climate of Political Correctness, its dozen Oscars would be snatched away quicker than you could filch 200 victories from Joe Paterno if there were anything truly objectionable or inaccurate about it. By contrast, 12 has a much more meager musical score, and its lack of action scenes classify it as low-budget fare relegated to play only at so-called ""art houses"" to date. This probably is for the best. Whereas WIND was a stepping stone allowing Blacks to take home their first Oscar (presaging Jackie Robinson with the Dodgers, everyone with the NBA, and Obama in the White House), 12 seems Hell-bent on perpetuating racial conflict today by its implication that white American Southerners of the early 1800s were racist beasts (with the men looking so scruffy in their unkempt beards that they could fit right in with today's Boston Red Sox!). Just as documented anti-Semite director Mel Gibson's flogging ""torture porn"" was a widely perceived and obviously delusional attempt to besmirch American Jews a few years back in his PASSION OF THE CHR!ST, 12 director Steve McQueen's use of flogging torture porn (against the plantation's most compliant and best worker, no less!) may have a similar misguided ulterior motive. Draw your own conclusions."
"thesamarpanghosh","10","0","1","12 May 2020"," Freedom asks for its existence
","'12 Years A Slave' portrays a precise 1853 environment. The strong and serious vibes conveying the message of slave trade in 19th century points directly the presence of slavery sign in present era. Even in groups of 20 and 30 together, they're helpless to death's call. Slavery and racial discrimination although were in prime focus as shown in America during that era but that exist in other periods, including present day in many parts of world as well which can be conterminous to human trafficking, inequality and human rights violation as such.
The screenplay, the use of verbal skills were apt. Accents were spectacular. The songs in the farms and others scenes as shown were much needed. Solomon's continuous urge describing himself as 'freeman' make us realise what freedom actually means. The lynching of Patsey all over just a piece of soap was absolutely heart racking as the cruelty solely signifies how delirious a person can go for the obsession of totalitarian regimes. This movie puts humanity into an embarrassment, and why not!"

","When I applied into NYU I was given the prompt in the title, this was my response, I didn't get in but I hope you can enjoy it.<br/><br/>The relationship between imagery, sound and dialogue allow me to submerge
myself into the depths of meaning in a well-told story. I delight in looking through the
proverbial haystack for the movies that successfully tell an engaging story, stir
feelings and force me to reconsider aspects of my life. No other art form has the power to transcend the screen the way cinema does for me.<br/><br/>The last time I found a needle, was with the movie 12 Years a Slave. Based on the
1853 book that chronicles the slave memoirs of Solomon Northup, a freeborn African American who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. The vision the director, Steve McQueen, brings to the film manages to capture the full depth of emotions Solomon felt in his struggles. The viewer, sucked into the character, is forced to feel what the protagonist feels.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock famously said ""Always make the audience suffer as much as possible"", it seems that director Steve McQueen took that to heart. There is a scene in which Solomon's hanging is interrupted leaving him balancing for his life on the tip of his toes, ensuing the longest 85 seconds of my life. I felt trapped in this scene,
visibly stressed and holding my breath as if the noose was on my neck as well. This
scene holds the viewers, demanding emotions from them and it does not release its
grasp until the expected toll is paid.<br/><br/>This story and its' magnificent movie representation would have never existed if
Solomon had not been able to overcome his challenges. Consider the immeasurable
number of stories worth telling that will never have their time because they did not
survive their hanging. This inspires me to look for stories and tell them well to honor
all those that didn't make it."

","In the long history of mankind, people's understanding of freedom is completely different in different times. Step by step, people in each era traded huge sacrifices for the beginning of the next new stage, bringing a little freedom to the people. Now that human rights have been greatly respected, our understanding of freedom has become a need for a job you like, a life you want, and a home in a developed city. It seems incredible to people in any past era! I don't know how people in the future will think about the problems facing society today, but the problems must be solved well. The significance of history lies in letting people in the new era know the tremendous efforts of former people, and letting people in the new era believe that many things in this world will become reality, and our pursuit will surely be echoed! Looking back at the painful hurried and miserable past can also make people face the future positively.

","British director Steve McQueen (not that one) has made three movies, each being harder to watch than the last. He takes subjects that inherently feature as showcases of man's potential cruelty. His last film, Shame, featured Michael Fassbender as a man for whom the act of sex holds no appeal, no matter how he tried to rectify it. 12 Years a Slave, though not as painful, is no less powerful. As with Shame, it features an incredible lead performance, this time by Chiwetel Ejiofor. He plays Solomon Northup, a born-free black man who was kidnapped off the streets of Washington D.C. and sold into slavery. In addition to the performances, the main stars are the art direction and score. McQueen has a clear eye for striking imagery, but only when he finds time for it amidst the atrocity. Hans Zimmer, the composer who made his name with The Dark Knight and Inception, brings just the right amount of menace to the film's soundtrack, and ends up as one of his more understated works. So while 12 Years is certainly not for everyone, it's something everyone should see."

"williampsamuel","10","0","2","10 April 2019"," As Profound and Essential as it is Hard to Watch
","I will be honest. Twelve years a slave is not the easiest of movies to watch. Nor should it be, because its only goal is to cast an unflinching glare on the institution of slavery, perhaps the darkest stain on our nation's history.<br/><br/>At no point does it try to shield viewers from the horror it is exposing, but neither does it fall into the realm of sappy tear jerking. It simply shows the truth of slavery, which is that it was an inherently brutal and cruel institution base on fear and the complete control of another person. Solomon Northrop discovered this firsthand when he was lured from his comfortable life in New York and sold into bondage by men he thought were his friends.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays the horror and bewilderment Solomon felt upon the realization of his captivity and his grim determination never to accept his state with stoicism and restraint. At time it may seem that he- and by extension the film- lacks emotion, but this is represents not a lack of emotion, but rather numbness, alienation, and repression of his rage and anguish. It's only when you look closer that you see his despair, loneliness, and profound homesickness. Solomon's repeated maxim is that you cannot let yourself be consumed with despair; for then you are lost and your master has won.<br/><br/>Just as Ejofor shows great restraint in his acting, the film shows admirable restraint in not portraying all white Southerners or even all slave owners as vicious evil men, while still not apologizing for their actions or letting anyone off the hook. Master Ford is a decent and surprisingly kind man for a slaveholder and is clearly uncomfortable with the more inhumane aspects of the institution. Yet he paternalistically believes that it is enough to be a good master, and when Solomon's life is threatened the best he can do is to sell him off to a man with a notorious reputation for harshness and anger.<br/><br/>And Master Epps is a harsh and angry man. Played by Michael Fassbender with intensity, barely contained fury, and not a trace of mercy or humanity, he is every bit as hatable as Cotton Candy from Django Unchained, yet far more believable. A sadist and an inveterate racist, he believes that his every misfortune is the fault dark skinned chattel and that the lash is the solution to every problem. Besides his propensity for using his fist and the lash against his slaves, he also shows 'favor' to his favorite slave woman by directing his affections towards her. And his is the kind of affection that is not only imposed against her will but violently forced upon her. The kind of affection which fills his wife with jealousy and hatred the girl. The kind of affection which makes a woman wishes she was dead.<br/><br/>His cruelty is exceptional even by the standards of the time, but even when it not overtly brutal, the slave's life is one of toil and degradation. It's a life of long days working in the hot sun, of debasing yourself before any white man, of being subject to your master's every whim. To survive a man learns to keep his head down, to never stand up for himself or let on that he knows as much as he does. And he does it out of fear. Twelve years never lets the viewer forget that the entire institution of slavery is based on fear of violence and death. Fear so strong that it breaks a person, makes them go about their work while a man hangs from a tree, even whip their fellow slave lest they be in the same place.<br/><br/>Nor is only the slave who is affected by the evils of slavery, though he bears it the hardest by far. Seemingly gentle men are made callous by their participation in the peculiar institution, even as the suffering they cause, directly or not, eats at their conscience Even in the midst of hypocritical self pity, a white cotton picker shares a nugget of truth; whipping other men day in day out for a living doesn't sit well with a man's conscience. He either eases his guilt with excuses or numbs himself with drink, because any man with a heart knows deep down that slavery is a vile and inhumane practice.<br/><br/>This is a lesson that Twelve Years never lets the audience forget, though some may wish to. Even the happy ending is at best bittersweet, because when the nightmare is over and he's a free man again, it still doesn't make everything right. He will never get those twelve years back, so much has changed in his absence, and while he regained his freedom, the other slaves on the plantation don't have theirs. It's a depressing thought, but this was a depressing reality, and one we should all be aware of."
"senaoz","8","0","3","19 March 2019"," A very attractive story
","The storyline which is based on a true story is very attractive. Every single scene was gripping and the movie was reflecting successfully the era when the story happened. I also liked the scenario but the lead actor did not give me the impression of a man who was forcibly detached from his family. He was not complaining enough being away from his family, he was only trying to get used to be a slave and to survive. In my opinion, a person who left outside alone from his family had to suffer more. He did not worry about if his family was ok or still alive. This situation is 'vice versa' for Solomon Northup's family too. During the film, we could not figure out if the family tried to reach Solomon Northup. The last missing thing was that the movie had to show the time of Solomon Northup's slavery process too because we could not understand how many time passed and it made more difficult to follow the process."

","This film is beyond rating and discussion of technique. It is, simply put, a film every American, white Americans especially, needs to see. McQuee's commitment to show both the violence that was heaped upon black bodies and the degradation heaped upon black souls is a much needed correction to a lot of nonsense in American politics. Moreover, that the three most violent scenes are done in shot, and in long take contain the subtle point of we shouldn't look away. The film is a very hard watch as it should be.<br/><br/>The script does a remarkable job of shaping Northup's ordeal into a universal tale of African slavery. Each of the main points in the slave trad, i.e. the middle passage, being sold, so called ""kindly"" masters and sheer brutes, all have hearings in the film. The script largely avoids the issue of Northup's story, because he is rescued, being unrepresentative. This is done by always juxtaposing Northup's survival with a person who was so lucky, as most clearly scene in the Northup thinks about running away.<br/><br/>The film is accurate depiction of one of the greatest evils humankind commits. In that way it is a milestone."

"yasxrk","9","0","1","3 January 2019"," Brilliant yet disturbing
","Steve McQueen manages to create an unforgettable depiction of slavery in the 19th century with his latest work,12 Years A Slave.
The film's harrowing and emotional scenes makes for difficult viewing,however it is perhaps the first film to not shy away from portraying slavery in its pure,unadulterated form of atrocity and this is why the film is a unique,powerful experience.
Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers an utterly brilliant performance as the musician Solomon Northup,who was tricked into abduction, and consequently slavery.Ejiofor portrays the emotion and despondence of Northup to perfection,yet he always manages to maintain a sense of nobility,even though he is enduring an agnosising plight.In moments where he feels he cannot speak due to his position as a slave,Ejifor's uses his facial expressions to illustrate the anguish and pain of his ordeal,leaving an indelible effect on the audience of his sorrow and suffering.
Michael Fassbender gives a great performance as Edwynn Epps,the slaver of Northup.Fassbender embodies the character of Epps,and his internal struggle with sanity that drives him to barbarous cruelty and acts of random sadism, is portrayed by his pure malovence that leaves the audience terrified and disgusted.
Perhaps the most astonishing work by a actor/actress accomplished in this masterpiece is by Lupito Nyong'o. The young talent is the emotional core of the film;she displays the savagery of the slaves' ordeal with her anger and despair that rocks the audience to their core.
Furthermore,the cinematography achieved by Sean Bobbit is exquisite,creating a stark juxtaposition between the wondrous beauty of the natural world and the ugliness of humanity.
McQueen has produced a film that accurately depicts the history of enslavement,while creating a cinematic work of art that is greatly powerful and will leave a lasting effect on audiences for years to come."

1. when the hero was escaping from his master into the jungle that scene was really underpowered as it could have been great run and chase describing the hope of getting free and anxiety.
2. Other scene was when the hero was writing a letter to his family even then director has not put any effort to show the emotions of a slave writting to his family. That scene could also have given an additional dose to the viewers<br/><br/>3. scene where broken violin was shown by the hero, the director has missed to direct the frustration of a slave breaking the violin that's scene could have been much better.<br/><br/>4.

","This is an incredibly filmed movie, with stunning cinematography, superb acting, and a story so engaging it will heighten every emotion within the viewer. I highly recommend it. <br/><br/>My issues with the film are mainly its dissection of source material. The move movie is based on the title character's memoirs. Solomon is depicted, in the first scene of the movie, as being sexually provoked/molested-whatever-by another slave. This character was a strong Christian, and my issue is less about his response in the film than the actual scene. Why start a film off with sex between non-consenting adults, when such a scenario is never discussed in the book. Totally outside the source material, and obviously a director's choice. But it diminishes the religiosity of the character in my opinion. <br/><br/>Also, Brad Pitt's character is portrayed as far too much of a Jesus-figure than in the memoir. His detached ambience is appealing on the screen, but no true to what the book records. <br/><br/>All in all, fabulous film. A few minor issues."

","'12 Years A Salve' is a harrowing, yet brilliantly made film, that shakes it's viewers to the core. Screenwriter John Ridley adapts the real-life story of Solomon Northup in the most emotional and brutal way possible and has an effect on the audience in ways no other movie has. The story alone, movie or not, is something worth of praise and fortunately director Steven McQueen adapted it for the screen in the authentic and raw manner that it needed to be shown in. Leading actor Chiwetel Ejiofor immerses himself into the role of Solomon Northup exceptionally, and is supported by a talented cast all round, the standouts being Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o and Sarah Paulson. Nyong'o, in particular, steals every single scene she is in and is well-deserving of her Academy Award that she received for this role. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is also a standout in the film and contributes greatly to the emotional aspect of the film, and the overall atmosphere. While I've seen a lot of emotional and heart-wrenching films in my lifetime, I have never been so emotionally affected by this film. Every aspect of this film contributes to the overall greatness of this film that portrays the atrocities of the U.S. slave industry in a way that's never been done before. I never thought I'd cry from a movie, but '12 Years A Slave' has proved me wrong."

","12 Years A Slave is an remarkable true story that tells the life of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a free African American who lived in Saratoga, New York with his wife and two children. After he was convinced to travel to Washington for two weeks to work with two musicians who promised him work, he was drugged, chained, beaten, and stripped of his identity. He was then given the name Platt and sold into slavery in the deep south. Throughout his twelve years as a slave, he was owned by two men, Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) who treated him in diverse ways. Ford was a civil master who treated Solomon with kindness but was forced to sell him to Edwin Apps due to a violent situation that occurred between Solomon and one of the plantation managers who was jealous of his intelligence. This violent situation caused Solomon to live through fair during the remainder of his time as a slave. <br/><br/>Considering that this occurred during the pre-civil times in the United States, it is obvious to see that the film is based on slavery along with self-entitlement and self-gain. Justice was wrongly served to Solomon and even though his first master (Ford) was aware of this, he only cared to cover his debts and the investment that he had put into purchasing Solomon as a slave. The film easily maintained a repetitive theme of individuals who understood that what they were doing was wrong, but they did not care to correct it due to society and the current circumstances. A key example of this is shown when Solomon was bribed to travel with two men who promised to pay him for his performance, but instead, they drugged and sold him as a slave. Another film that represents the key elements of this theme is Selma as it also covers the roles of whites, whether it be as slave-owners or segregationist. Selma also focuses on the cruelty and violence against African Americans. <br/><br/>Overall, 12 Years A Slave is a great film and the director used great techniques to capture the horror that Solomon Northup encountered as a slave. Two great techniques that were used included the quality of images along with the angles and lighting. An example of this included the candlelight that was illuminating in the dark which resembled a time when Solomon was struggling with his sanity. Great angles were used to capture his emotions and the fear that he felt as he lived his life as a slave. Though Solomon struggled to survive due to the cruelty and hardships that he faced, through faith, and the willpower to survive, he managed to endure his twelve years as a slave."

The film is based upon the memoir of a free African-American who lived in NY in the 1840s. He was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the deep south. I read the memoir, and the film is true to it, As someone with a degree in US history, I understand that a primary source such as a memoir can be a valuable reflection of a period in time, particularly if it is measured against other primary sources for accuracy. The memoir is legitimate.

","I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was very moving and real unlike most movies that depict slavery. It is such a sad thing to see but I feel as if the director and producers did an amazing job with the delivery of the whole thing. I felt as if I were in the production myself. The scene where Patsey is tied to the tree and has to be whipped and the plantation owner makes Solomon do it is so heartbreaking, and even when the mother gets separated from her children I felt her pain. Solomon tries his best to survive in the conditions that he is subjected to, especially being a freeman that was captured into slavery. I think he does his best to try and keep his head up and towards the end of the movie it all pays off and the ending is somewhat joyous because he finally is reunited with his family, but the ending of the movie also reveals that the men that sold him into slavery faced no repercussions. Overall I enjoyed the movie very much."

","I believe this movie was done exceptionally well. This movie directed by Steve McQueen was almost perfect at depicting the true story of Solomon Northup acted by Chiwetel Ejiofor. It included vivid and real events such as when Solomon a free man of Upstate New York was recruited by two men who claimed to be circus performers and convinced Northup to travel with them to Washington D.C. where they would earn lots of money. Upon arriving to Washington D.C. the men treat Northup to drinks and dinner where he is drugged, and wakes from his unconscious state to find himself in shackles and chains in a cell. He was delivered by ship to New Orleans. In June he is sold in a slave market where he is known by alias name, Platt Hamilton. He is first sold to a man named Ford. Northup ends up running into trouble with a man named Tibeats who works on Ford's land who envies how strategic and smart Northup. Tibeats ends up getting Northup hung where the look out for the land spots Tibeats and tells him to scram before he shoots him and his friends. Ford ends up finding Northup and cuts him down. The next day he tells Northup that he has created a reputation for himself and was returned to the slave market. He then is sold to a man named Mr. Epps where he serves the rest of his years working on the plantation. This is where my favorite part occurs in which a Canadian man named Mr. Bass tells the Epps that Mr. Solomon is a free man by law and helps him to prove that he is free and returns him back to his family in Saratoga. This movie included great actors to portray as characters from the book 12 Years a Slave."

"pbeyene","10","0","1","2 January 2018"," A Must See!
","""12 Years a Slave"" has been a film I have planned to but never got around to watching. Instant regret hit me when I finally watched the film. Steve McQueen's juxtaposition of short and still shots made ""12 Years A Slave"" an emotional rollercoaster of a movie. For example, the 3 minutes of the main character, Solomon Northup, hanging on a noose from a tree was so much longer than the cut that lasted a split second when Northup was cut free by the slave master. McQueen utilizes the long, wide shot of Northup's hanging to symbolize the length of Northup's time enslaved. Despite the obvious strangulation of Northup, McQueen makes known that this inhumane act was a normality on slave plantations when children are shown playing around in the field in the background of the shot while other slaves continue to work and Northup continues to tiptoe to stay alive. Viewing this part of the film was both uncomfortable and scarring by seeing the both the pain of of Northup and the mistreatment of slaves in that time. ""12 Years A Slave"" is a must see film, it does not shy away from the gore and pain of slavery in the American south. It realistically portrays the life of a freeman turned slave, through its use of heavy music and painful long shots."
"kylelouisoncc","9","0","1","30 December 2017"," Wonderful Depiction of Life As A Slave
","This was a brilliant masterpiece composed by Steve McQueen which follows a freeman who is deceived and brought into slavery separating him from his family for twelve years.It's very vivid in portraying the daily life of a slave and captures many of the horrors that slaves experienced and cruel acts wrought upon them by slave owners like whipping, sexual assault, verbal abuse, and other forms of physical torture and punishment. If anything, the movie sends the clear message that to be a slave was the most horrific ordeal one could go through and it showed, in most cases, the short lifespan of a slave.Although the physical abuse is plain and present the emotional/mental trauma that results might be the worse shown through a mother crying hysterically nonstop for her children which were taken from her and, in the end, Solomon Northup's tearful reunion with his family which he hadn't seen for twelve years. Altogether this film captures how life was as a slave as well as capturing the attitudes of the south toward slavery (pro-slavery, prejudice, racial discrimination, etc.)."

","I can understand if this movie isn't some people's cup of tea. The way it's paced is a little jarring (although to me not ""boring"" as some have suggested). And I get that no one but the Marquis de Sade would enjoy watching so many scenes of harrowing brutality. Maybe you just don't find the subject matter interesting, or you like a different kind of storytelling. That's entirely valid.<br/><br/>But some of these reviews are downright offensive. Nothing is more irritating than reading reviews of white people who are pissy that ""there are no good white people"" in the film, or ""we get it - all white people are bad, all black people are good."" Yes, I know, it's uncomfortable to accept that slavery was that evil, that sadistic, and entirely motivated by race - BUT IT WAS. Even the ""nicest"" slave-owners were racist douchebags. It's a myth (started and perpetuated by racist confederate veterans, by the way) that slaves were treated as anything more than animals.<br/><br/>I'm glad that this movie is so graphic because judging from some of these reviews people need to be reminded that this wasn't just a few years of involuntary servitude for people. I say this as someone whose ancestors owned slaves 200 years ago - what is so difficult about admitting it was this bad? This attitude that ""it wasn't so black and white"" (pun intended) is a complete crock. White southerners viewed black people as inferior beings, semi-human, MERCHANDISE to do whatever they wished with. If you have a problem with honest history being depicted, then you're the problem, not the movie.<br/><br/>End rant. I personally think it's a beautiful film, and one that is obviously necessary in a time when some people want to believe the depicted events are exaggerated. Maybe that's because accepting the brutality and totality of our past crimes has implications for how we should behave moving forward, and people don't want to have to change their belief systems. But going down that rabbit-hole would take more words than this space allows."

This movie is a outstanding movie all around, definitely one of my favorite films from 2013. The movie captures Solomon's's frustrations brilliantly, that he is a freeman sold into slavery but nobody believes him because he is black, it can be compared to Shakespeare's 'comedy of errors' in the way the mistaken identity plays a major part. The story of the movie is excellent and very interesting, what makes it even better is that it's a true story. All of us no matter if we are black, white, Asian etc. we can all feel for Solomon and his hardship and when we put our minds into Solomon's situation we feel for him even more. Chiwetel Ejiofor does an excellent job of conveying to the audience the sheer pain that Solomon faces. Michael Fassbender just like in Queen's previous films: 'Shame' and 'Hunger' plays a really evocative character. Also just like in Queen's previous films the use of lighting plays a huge part in the play. The use of light in the film distinguishes between joyful scenes and joyless scenes. Overall I believe this is a very solid movie and I found it to be a very enjoyable watch."

Many slaves were beaten, raped, hung, and essentially stripped of all of their human rights. They were not even given the right to their own name or children.

This movie shows a free black man, Solomon, who was sold into slavery and after 12 years, he finally escaped the misery of a slave's life. Throughout Solomon's time as a slave he was sold to different masters, almost hanged to death, beat and whipped until he could barely move, and experienced other slave's hardships as well. Families were ripped apart, women were raped by their masters, and all slaves were treated inhumanely. <br/><br/>This movie was hard to watch at many parts, for example when slaves were whipped for not producing enough cotton or when one woman just wanted soap to clean herself showing how basic human necessities were denied to slaves. It was heartbreaking to watch and experience a mother's pain when her children were stolen from her by the slave system, and after crying constantly and mourning her loss, her owner decided to kill her. <br/><br/>The true horror of slavery was accurately shown in this film and the movie shows how horrible black people were really treated in this time period."

","The film 12 Years a Slave follows the story of Solomon Northrup, a free man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South. Throughout his twelve years of wrongful enslavement, he lives on two plantations, both cruel and brutal in their own ways.<br/><br/>While on the first plantation, owned by William Ford, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, he is treated fairly well by the owner. But the other overseers are brutal, beating and whipping him for no reason whatsoever. This leads to one of the most moving scenes in the movie, where Solomon is hanged from a tree. Solomon is hung, with his feet barely on the ground, as a punishment for retaliating against the cruel master. There was a big juxtaposition between Solomon, who was in agonizing pain, and the beautiful nature surrounding him, with children playing in the grass, which made the scene very difficult to watch. When Solomon was on the second plantation, it showed, even more, heart breaking cruelties, such as when he was forced to whip Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o, until her skin was raw. It also showed the raping and abuse that the women slaves suffered, which was truly difficult to watch. <br/><br/>Today, we will never be able to fully comprehend what it was like to go through life as a slave, this movie gives a lot of insight into it. It shows the realities of slavery, without sugarcoating it, or leaving the most important details out. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, as it's important to understand the realities of slavery and teach those who did not live through it, so we will not repeat this dark time of American history."

","12 Years A Slave tells the story of Solomon Northup who was abducted and made a slave. Through much pain and suffering Solomon is passed from slaver to slaver and attempts to regain his freedom. <br/><br/>Many of the camera angles draw parallels to Tarantino's 'Django Unchained' with close-up shots as well as the ""protagonist in front of a tree"" shot (or in this films case- tied to it). Though other than this the story is dark, it does very well to show the emotions of the characters and makes the whole thing seem very authentic. This is aided by the very talented acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor (Solomon), Lupita Nyong'o (Patsey) and Michael Fassbender (Epps).<br/><br/>The clear message the film was trying to convey was of course to treat our fellow human being with respect and dignity. The brutality of many of the scenes (Patsey whipping scene, Solomon hanging scene- to name a few) really draws in how cruel the slavers were to the slaves and allows us to see the errors of the past. The most shocking part for me personally is that the slavers had no full control over their ""property"", this is shocking seeing as though they can treat them so poorly and also have sex with any of them at any time and they didn't seem to think that any of it was wrong. <br/><br/>Much of the self belief that the slavers are entitled to property is from the Bible and it is quoted many times, in fact God is mentioned very frequently throughout the film. While the Bible did support slavery, it was not cruel or brutal slavery as that shown in the film, it would be servitude for a small defined time not a lifetime and would not usually involve such barbarous acts.<br/><br/>This film is an excellent show of what happened not too long ago in the past in the modern ""western world"". At helps us to learn from our past mistakes and also does not shy away from violent and upsetting scenes/shots but shows them in their true, accurate and unforgivable form."

Some of them are rather astounding. The hanging scene, with no music, just hanging there while others walk around pretending to not notice really hit home. As, well, the whipping scene of the girl was a real masterpiece. I had to rewind the film again to make sure it was one long take. Super well done for sure.

","12 Years a Slave, directed by Steve McQueen, is, if not a perfect film, among the very important pieces of modern cinema. It's based on a true story of a man named Solomon Northup, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, a free black man in New York state, who one day is tricked and kidnapped and sold down south into slavery in the early 1840's. Seeing his life, and then seeing it suddenly ripped away is truly disturbing and heart-wrenching. It's not that we should feel worse for him than those who were born into slavery, who treated as bad or in many cases much worse; but telling the tale through the contrast highlights, extremely effectively, how inhumane this slave culture was.<br/><br/>Northup, after the terrifying transition into confinement, is shuttled from his kidnappers to slave traders to a plantation, and when that doesn't turn out so well to another plantation, the last where the majority of the movie takes place. All parts of the journey tell the struggle he goes through in different ways, and show the injustices of the era—all obviously awful—came in a variety, not a picture that can be drawn with a broad brush. It's unflinching in its brutality, to a critical and real purpose. Ejiofor is outstanding, as is Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson, and the host of supporting roles; included are some well-known actors who never come across as cameos but as very human pieces of this story that fit exceptionally well into the history, and never distract. Good and bad guys and those in-between, no one is typified by clichés or with complete simplicity.<br/><br/>Slavery is the United States' greatest sin. It's unfortunate it took nearly 100 years for our cinema to get from Birth of Nation to 12 Years a Slave, but now that it's here it's something that must be watched—watched by all Americans to further understand their history as this movie forthrightly displays; watched all film lovers for its powerful, exquisite craft on screen; and watched by all people to stress what can occur when a group of people is dehumanized in a culture. Slavery, or things not that far from slavery, still occur in too many corners of the world, we as a species are not past this completely still, and that is something we can be reminded of with this informative, tough and quite masterful drama on the subject."

","First i have to say, i went into this film blind. And i don't mean i'm blind, i mean i didn't know anything about this film before watching it. No trailers, no images, no summaries, no reviews, no nothing. Apart from the title of the movie. And to say the leas, i was quite surprised.<br/><br/>I knew it was about slavery, but what exactly, could have been anyone's guess. I never expected such an amazing story. A free man born in New York, gets kidnapped and sold into slavery. And so, he is stuck a slave for 12 years up until the day he finds a way to go back home. A good thing to note about this is that this is a real story. This actually happened to this man, he even wrote a book about it five years before the civil war.<br/><br/>Here's a quote from him about the book: "" What it may be in other States, I do not profess to know; what it is in the region of Red River, is truly and faithfully delineated in these pages. This is no fiction, no exaggeration."" -Solomon Northup<br/><br/>This movie was amazing. The actors, the writing, the atmosphere and the story, a story doesn't get any better than a real story.<br/><br/>Of course its not completely correct, and rightfully so, they must save up on time. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, for a movie with a short runtime of 1 hour and 34 minutes, it felt extremely long (in a good way).<br/><br/>A perfect movie in every aspect. A must watch film."

","12 YEARS A SLAVE is the third film in a row I've seen by director Steve McQueen with a 'worthy' theme (the first two were HUNGER and SHAME). This is by far his biggest production to date, with an enhanced budget and some of an epic feel to the true-life tale of a 19th century man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Solomon Northrup's life story is harrowing indeed although the only outcome of such a production is for the viewer to feel depressed.<br/><br/>The film is a bit like Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED but without the feel-good escapist stuff. Instead this is a dark movie that just gets darker and darker. It's a very well made production, featuring top-tier acting from a huge cast presided over by the great Chiwetel Ejiofor who I've had my eye on for a long time ever since he impressed me in CHILDREN OF MEN. Michael Fassbender is particularly outstanding as the ruthless slave owner although Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt also do well with their lesser roles. Most of the disturbing stuff involves newcomer Lupita Nyong'o and very convincing she is too.<br/><br/>The real star of the show is McQueen himself, whose direction is often breathtaking. The cinematography is really exceptional and contrasts the beauty of the natural surroundings with the ugliness of the human activity taking place within them. I liked the way McQueen took time out for some slow, lingering moments which are worthy of Herzog. Personally I'm a fan of escapism myself so this isn't the kind of film I could force myself to sit through again, as important as it is; it's depressing and heartbreaking in equal measure, but a film that everyone should watch once."
"eshwarmail","7","0","1","21 June 2016"," Uncomfortable viewing experience but it falls short on achieving its ambition. Watch it for Michael Fassbender!!
","Set in some of the darkest days of American history tells a remarkable story full of horrors, brutality, courage, hope, helpnessness and longing. It is exceptionally cast, beautifully acted, perfectly paced and filled with strong moments. At the risk of contradicting myself, the only weak link seems to be Chiwetel Ejiofor's one dimensional acting that further oversimplifies the one dimensional character he plays.<br/><br/>While the movie establishes a powerful connection with its above said strong moments, looking back at it might seem a little exploitative which tries too hard to add a sentimental value around every possible scene. However the movie is elevated with a near perfect performance by Michael Fassbender who epitomizes all the evils associated to slavery with his hellish expressions and some of his actions adding to uncomfortable viewing.<br/><br/>Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man in the north who has a bumbling career, a comfortable home, loving wife and kids and respect in the society. His world turns upside down when he gets abducted, shipped away to the south and pushed to slavery without a means to contact his family or friends. He gets crushed into his own shell as his identity, skills and education becomes a threat to his life. His misery gets compounded when an unavoidable circumstance leads him to sadistic and volatile 'Master' Epps (Michael Fassbender) leaving his empathizing current 'Master' Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). He is now called Platt, a cotton farmer and an occasional fiddle player who cries to sleep everyday ruing his fate and missing his family.<br/><br/>While the movie succeeds in presenting the horrors and brutality of slavery, the USP of this movie lies in projecting the upliftment of human spirit where I think it failed to an extent especially with Ejiofor's single expression throughout. Another powerful performance of a tormented slave between her master's lust and mistress's jealousy as Patsey by Lupita Nyong'o commands a mention. But the showstopper performance is by Michael Fassbender as he evokes ""Daniel Plainview"" from ""There will be blood"" filled with ego, unpredictability and violent tendencies. The authenticity factor also take a beating a little bit with some 'A' list actors making a cameo around every corner.<br/><br/>Uncomfortable viewing experience but it falls short on achieving its ambition.

","THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is a 1853 memoir by an African-American man named Solomon Northup. Since then, his story has been adapted twice. One being a PBS special, the second being an amazing, all star cast, winner of 3 Academy Awards, and a Oscar winning 2013 film. You do not have all of these combinations, and have a poor film to show. 12 Years a Slave, is a harsh, but a sadly true subject we've seen, and read before. But I believe, 12 Years a Slave is probably the most brutal, realistic view, evil, nightmarish, heart pounding tale of American slavery since the original Roots. American slavery was awful, and Solomon Northup goes through Hell in this film. Even though this film, and its subject matter can be harsh. It is a film to view, learn from, and understand the cruelty that happened to Africans in America. I believe this is a film for everyone to see and learn from, no matter what race, religion, or region you may be from. Director Steve McQueen (Shame, Hunger, uses the best filmmaking techniques, to demonstrate the unimaginable cruelty, our main character has to through, and how our main character has to not only survive but truly live. The acting in this film is so well done. In this movie, Michael Fassbender (X-Men First Class, Jobs)is the devil. Brad Pitt (Fight Club, Oceans 12) is a good man in a cruel world. Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story)really gets under your skin, and comes off as a bully. You really feel sad for Lupita Nyong'o, and our lead, Chiwetel Ejiofor (4 Brothers, Salt) truly is an amazing actor. There are numerous scenes, when he can literally tell he has been through Hell, with just looking in his eyes. In addition, the scenery of the South is very beautiful. On the other hand, the ugliness of slavery makes the film have a very interesting contrast. Overall, I believe 12 Years a Slave is a movie everyone should see. It is a good film, that conveys a nightmarish, evil period in American history. It feels real, organic, and it is an amazing film. I am more than proud to give this film a rating of 10/10. This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember don't just get down, but get boogie. Thank you so much for reading, and have an amazing day as always. :)<br/><br/>P.S., Gil Scott-Heron came out with a great song, titled ""The Revolution Will not be Televised"". Well it's more than just televised, it's in the theaters, homes, streaming, etc. We should all be proud."
"s_b_jackson","8","0","1","13 June 2016"," A movie that polarises opinions......
","I am not sure whether I have ever seen a film on here that has attracted such a wide range of strongly-held opinions. On one hand there are those that feel that it is well-made and acted, powerfully conveying an important message; conversely, those are others who consider it to be a boring, misleading political rant.<br/><br/>Clearly, there is nobody now alive who actually witnessed the reality of slavery in the USA in the nineteenth century, but there is sufficient documented evidence to show how incredibly significant it was in terms of its effect upon the lives of millions of people, both black and white. Not being either black nor American, I do not have the 'cutural background' that might lead me to hold any strong political views on this issue, which I feel may have influenced the opinions of this film by some reviewers.<br/><br/>My small contribution to this discussion is as follows: to me this is a horror movie as difficult to watch as most any conventional slasher / haunted house films. The plot in a horror film works most effectively when a normal person is put into what appears to be a normal situation, but is, in fact, a condition of extreme danger which they are helpless to do anything about. This is precisely the situation that faces Solomon Northup in this film; he is a normal man (unusual in that he is black and free, but that was clearly shown as normal where and when he lived) who is suddenly put into a situation that he is unable to escape from. The horror of his situation is exacerbated by the fact that the extreme brutality around him is treated as normality; two examples being how the children play in the background when Northup is hanging standing on his tip-toes and how the runaway slaves are casually strung up by (presumably) 'pattyrollers' when Northup is contemplating escape. It is truly shocking, to me at least, how the 'average' white person - not just the psychotic Epps and his wife, but also the slave dealers - treat the black characters; not only do they treat them as less than human (because they consider them to be less than human), but they treat them worse than I would consider that they should treat any living thing, such as a dog or horse or cow. The casual way that Epps arranges for cotton pickers who failed to collect below a certain (arbitarily decided by him) mass of cotton in a day to be savagely whipped is gut-ravishingly nauseating.<br/><br/>Films have a number of purposes, including entertainment, excitement and stimulation, but these are not the only purposes of movie-making. There is also the purpose of education and the provocation of consideration and discussion, and this film sits in that category. In my view, it is important to remember significant aspects of human history, and films make an important contribution to this. It is possible that Northup's book was not necessarily a faithful report, given that slavery was a very 'hot' political potato at the time of its publication, it is possible to speculate that the publishers may have distorted the truth to push their own agenda. Furthermore, the movie does not faithfully reproduce the plot of the book, but that does not mean that it misrepresents the conditions that the slaves had to undergo as a consequence.<br/><br/>My view, for what it is worth, is that this is a well-made and powerful film that makes an important contribution to the public perception of a significant aspect of human history. I believe that it should be mandatory viewing for young people in their teens, in order to make them aware of man's potential inhumanity to his fellow man, and - hopefully - improve their tolerance of the world around them."

","Film review – 12 Years a Slave<br/><br/>The movie 12 years a slave gives us the story of a slave called Salomon Northup. Salomon is a free man in the beginning, but he gets kidnapped and ends up in a southern state as a slave. The setting is set in southern USA in the 19th century, and is telling the story of a slave.<br/><br/>Salomon starts as a free man in New York City. He has a wife and kids. Then he is going to Washington D.C, but gets kidnapped when he arrives. He was sold on a slave market before he ends up on a plantation. Salomon's first owner is a person who is open to hear what Salomon has to say. They are cooperating to find out how to use the river for their advantages. Sadly, a man called John Tibeats is working there too. He is an overseer and his job is to make sure all the slaves are working properly. He gets in a fight with Salomon, and even though the slave owner is on Salomon's side, he was sold to another slave owner. When he arrives here, he was put to work in a cotton plantation. Every day they had to have at least 200 pounds with cotton. One of the slaves that improved the most was the woman Patsey. She gathered 500 pounds every day. Edwin, the owner wants to protect Patsey, even though his wife Mary wants to sell her. One day Patsey use her Sunday to visit the neighbor plantation. When he come back home with a piece of soap, she gets whipped. At the end of the film, a missionary called Samuel Bass arrives. He want to help Salomon get his freedom back. Salomon writes a letter to his friends back in New York City, to send a proof of his freedom in return. At the end a man with a wagon arrives to drive Salomon back to his freedom. When he comes home to his family, he discover that his wife has a new husband. The movie ends here with everyone embracing each other. <br/><br/>This film is discussing important themes, which was important then as it is today. The film is told from a slave's angel. It is describing a normal day at a plantation, and what the white slave owners did to them. They are serving us the dark USA, and are telling us how much racism it was before. It also remind us that this must never happen again. A lot of this can be compared with the world today. There are still a lot of racism and discriminating. Not just in the USA, but in the whole world. <br/><br/>This film includes interesting characters and dialogue. The story is good, and is taking us into the slave era. We are following Salomon during the whole movie, and the way it is told is very good. We know what he is thinking without being inside his head. The characters is well described and we know who is the bad guys when we see them and hear their first sentence. One of the negative sides is that the story is only told from one angel. To be a complete trustworthy story, they should have included at least one angel from the white people. This film is recommended for everyone, telling an important story. Score: 8/10"
"Mobithailand","10","0","3","10 April 2016"," it is one of those movies that not only Americans, but all the movie-going public needs to see.
","A true story provides the background for this tragic, and incredibly thought-provoking film. As many have already stated, there is a surprising dearth of feature films that deal with this most uncomfortable of subjects – slavery in the USA. Even more surprising – or maybe predictable, depending on your point of view – is that it has taken an English Director and largely European actors, to bring to the silver screen the tale of Solomon Northrup; a free black man living in upstate New York in the 1840's, who was kidnapped and sold into southern slavery. Director Steve McQueen, writer John Ridley, (an American), actors Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the stellar cast have, without any doubt, produced an immensely moving and highly watchable film.<br/><br/>Although there is much suffering, violence and cruelty depicted in the film, some say that the violence has been played down and that the reality of American slavery was much, much worse. Having recently Read Toni Morrison's ""Beloved"", I don't doubt it. The Director and writer also acknowledge that this may be so, but clearly they had to ask themselves what exactly would be achieved by endless violence, brutality and death, except to provide personal gratification to some sections of the audience.<br/><br/>Few films have been made on this subject, and by general consensus, none have been definitive. This being the case, the film-makers owed it to themselves – and their audience – to produce something that caught the essence of that troubled period of American history. They needed to show us what it was all about, without overwhelming the audience with an unremitting catalogue of unspeakable violence and depravity.<br/><br/>What they did show us is that there was no such thing as 'good' white slavers, even though some may have seemed 'less bad' than others; and that there were plenty of really evil slavers whose behaviour was unspeakably monstrous. Then there were the hapless slaves themselves. The women were raped, their children were split up and sold away from their families and they were all kept in line by brutal intimidation and the fear of summary execution for even the slightest infraction. All the above – and more – is shown in this film. For some reason, the horrors of slavery seem even more real when seen through the terrified eyes of an educated black man who was once lucky enough to have known a different life.<br/><br/>Twelve Years A Slave should be seen by every living American, just to remind them of how some of their not so distant ancestors behaved and to know about the unspeakable horrors that took place in their own country. They need to realise that this true event only happened a mere 150 years ago, and that slavery in their country still has ramifications within the social structure of present day USA. Even in my own lifetime, blacks in much of America were often abused, occasionally lynched and always treated as strictly second-class citizens.<br/><br/>If I was a black man living in today's America, how would I feel about my slave ancestors? Would I feel that it was another time and another place and life had moved on since then? Or would I wonder what manner of humanity sought to subjugate my race, and as recently as fifty years ago, I wouldn't have been permitted to sleep in the same hotel, or sit on the same bus seat or eat in the same restaurant or attend the same school as my white, fellow-citizens.<br/><br/>This is not a particularly easy film to watch, but it is one of those movies that not only Americans but all the movie-going public needs to see, as one way or another, it is all part of our shared history. Certainly us Brits - from where so many of the southern slavers' ancestors originated - have little to crow about, having been one of the main participants in the African slave trade for the best part of 300 years.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and contains some towering, inspirational performances from the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, and Michael Fassbender. It received 9 Oscar nominations and won for Best Picture, Best Supporting actress, and best-adapted screenplay. And it does have a happy ending, of sorts.<br/><br/>Read more about this reviewer at mobithailand.com"

","This film really was the film of the year. I don't know a person who didn't like this film and, unflinching as it was when dealing with such an emotive subject as slavery in 1800's Deep South America, Steve McQueen's brilliance in composing an unforgettable piece of film making was assured. The acting was first-class, the main cast and more lesser cast actors, alike. The cinematography was beautiful, thanks to the genius of Sean Bobbit. The moss hanging from the trees and the glorious sunsets almost became a juxtaposition for the examination into one of the most disturbing periods in human history and all of the evil, cruel ownership and treatment which one privileged human being was allowed to convey towards another, just because of their race. Steve is known as an ""artist-director"" having spent most of his early years directing videos and it shows in the sheer quality of the way he has crafted this superb film together.

","Steve McQueen's 2012 Best Picture winner, 12 Years a Slave provides an unflinching gaze into being black in the pre-Civil War United States. A film that touches so many levels of our nation's history, politics, economics, and morality; the film exists as a cornerstone for attempting to understand the struggle. One can never study too much, or gain too much of an understanding of something that shaped a nation and still contributes to today's understandings of individuals. If this year's presidential election is any indication, we need to be weary of the dark spots of our history so we avoid repeating them. 12 Years is a good place to start to gain a sense of that understanding.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor's Solomon Northup was an African American man living in upstate New York, where his relations with others were far from perfect, but he enjoyed his freedom. He was a free man in the time of slavery, working as a violinist. Solomon has a wife and two children and, considering their unfortunate place in history, live a good life. That good life is destroyed the day Solomon is abducted and sold into slavery. Initially vehement about his status as a free man to anyone he comes into contact with, Soloman eventually decides that cooperation is paramount to his survival. Sold as property to several landowners, Solomon is subjected to cruel working conditions including backbreaking labor under the harsh sun, whippings, and other forms of abuse. He is also demoralized by being forced to take communal showers and endless verbal abuse; all with the expectation of being responded with obedience. Twelve years pass with Solomon enduring these conditions, all the while his spirit and heartbroken over the family he left behind.<br/><br/>Powerful doesn't even begin to describe this film. The lengths McQueen went to ensure realism translated through the film. Much of this film's success is owed to a wonderful sound design team. The sounds the whips made as they struck flesh, namely in the scene in which Solomon is forced to beat fellow slave Patsey, (Lupita Nyong'o). The scene itself is gut-wrenching; Solomon's life was threatened if he refused to beat Patsey, or if he beat her too softly, leaving the slave-owner to enjoy a sadistic laugh with each strike to Patsey. Each release of the whip gave audience members a sting to the back it was so real. The acting was impeccable, with Ejiofor and Nyong'o both taking home Oscar's gold statuette for their performances. The aspect that made the film perhaps was the incredible direction by Steve McQueen. McQueen's ability to tell the story of the real-life Solomon Northup with such stark realism yet careful clarity proves him deserving of the Best Director Oscar he earned for this film. 12 Years a Slave was Academy's big winner for 2012, after seeing the film, it's no wonder why."

","Summery ​ The movie '12years a slave' , directed by the British director Steve McQueen in 2013, is a racism-related and civil rights' story. This movie is based on the true story that happened in 1880s' southern part of the States before the Civil Rights' War had broken up. Everybody will be watching it concerned with what a tragedy truly happened to a black man. A free black man Solomon Northup, who had a family and lived in a small town in a northeast State peacefully, was abducted and sold by fake merchants in Washington DC, and then brought to the white owners of the cotton farm in a southern state. In the movie, you can see what horrible treatment he had to suffer. After he worked for a couple of years, he decided to escape from there. Although he tried to do anything he could do at that time, and he made innumerable attempts, such as trying to ask a friend or a reliable man to help him become free and so on, everything failed A decade later, a Canadian carpenter, played by Brad Pitt, travelled there and was asked to repair the wall of a small hut. Meanwhile, Northup found that it's the last chance he would get to be free and then asked him for help. At first, the carpenter wasn't willing to help him because he didn't believe the slave, but he thought that maybe that slave had really been a freeman before. He called the police and some friends, and they let Northup be free from slavery. After his release he went home and could meet his grown-up family again. It's a rare case to get to be a free man again. Almost all the slaves captured by the fake merchants could not be free and return home. They mostly lived as slaves to the end of their life.<br/><br/>Review This movie is particularly focused on the American slavery age while Hollywood has been focusing on the topic. I'm surprised that the director also suffered from the discrimination because of his black skin since childhood, and his works aren't estimated fairly in the Hollywood world. Actually this movie may remind us that McQueen is to the movie world what Northup is to the slavery age."

I don't know why a movie like this needs an actor like him for such a small part, while there are no other big names in it.

","12 Years a Slave, which is directed by Steve McQueen and stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup, a free man from the state of New York, who in just one day loses his freedom and becomes a slave in the southern states. The movie will take you on a emotional journey, because the movie doesn't restrain itself from showing a lot of graphic violence. The violence depicted in the movie is not the only factor that causes emotional distress, Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance is also a huge contributor, probably this is his most memorable performance yet, he is really absorbed into the character, the best example for this are his eyes, on which you can notice a lot of sorrow. His performance receives a lot of help from the supporting cast, which also does a terrific job, especially Michael Fassbender as a slave owner, named Edwin Epps and Lupita Nyong'o as a slave, named Patsy. Both of them play an important role in the emotional journey of Solomon. Fassbender is simply terrifying in his role, the character's dementia is clearly visible. The supporting cast also helps Ejiofor to capture the passing of time, the change of mentality of his character is totally visible, owing to their help. Steve McQueen's direction is also brilliant, he captures some tough moments, where he shows that how easily life went on for some despite living in a hell. He also finds a lot of beauty in this hell, the movie having a huge amount of breathtaking imagery, which in my opinions shows that, earth is not hell, but we the humans make it to seem so. The movie has a minor problem too, Solomon Northup's life before the slavery is not shown enough, if it had been shown more, it would've given the viewers more to absorb and the motivation of the character, would've been even more visible. Overall the movie is a masterpiece, that sometimes is pretty hard to follow owing to its graphic nature, but after someone succeeds in sitting through the whole movie, he'll have a lot to think of and things are just worsened by its haunting score, that will remain deeply graved in your memory after leaving your seat."

","12 Years a Slave is the story of Solomon Northup, a northern abolitionist who was taken from the free north into the enslaved south, and for the next 12 years he spent his time waiting for the opportunity to reunite with his family. One aspect of the film that I found Intriguing was when Solomon was drugged and taken back to the deep south. This fascinated me in many ways. One being how easily a free black man could have been taken back to the south. The brutality of how slaves were treated horrified me. What scares me the most was not the whippings or the punishments, but how one man can brainwash himself into doing unimaginable acts of cruelty towards another human. What also piqued my interest was Solomon's determination to live and find his family. His faith that he will return to his family was the only thing that kept him alive.

","Solomon Northup, a well off, free and intelligent black man finds himself being kidnapped and sold into slavery. This movie not only explicitly takes you into the 1840s, it brings you to follow around the inhumanity of slavery itself. While watching, although I wanted so badly to look away and cry it completely keeps you attached to the screen and makes you feel uncomfortable every step of the way; I had expected a movie that would have been full on Hollywood romanticized, however this was not the case. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, and I think that he was the perfect person to do so. As a black actor, playing this part would seem to be unimaginably difficult (emotionally). He must put himself in the position that many of his people have faced, communicate with body language and sheer expressions to show his suppressed emotions as a slave with no rights, no humanity. <br/><br/>Moreover, I found this movie to be so incredible not only because of the reality but the accuracy. It not only almost identically followed the true accounts of Solomon Northup himself, but included all other historical accuracies of the 1800s. The way slavery is portrayed in the movie truly shows how vile and grim it was. It unsettles you, it makes you feel sick, but as a viewer it is impossible for you to look away. After watching, you feel as though you have seen a true form of our history and it only brings it to a bigger reality. This movie allows viewers to be educated of the true happenings without anything being sugarcoated. It brings history books to a swallow-able image.<br/><br/>Not only are the actors amazing, but the camera work as well. There is a scene in the movie, Solomon is about to be hung by Tibeats (the perfect image for white supremacy, minus the wealth, but he truly is scum). After he is saved from being hung, he stays barely touching the ground, rope around his neck. The camera stays on Solomon for about a good few minutes. This doesn't seem like a huge deal, but it wholeheartedly weighs you down just watching. He is hanging there, people on the plantation walking around him in the background, no sounds, no one doing a thing. This is only one scene that accurately displays how low, how dehumanized black slaves were seen during this time. I truly believe that out of anything I have seen or read of slavery, this scene and others from the movie made me REALLY realize that it had happened. In all of its atrocities. We, as white Americans, committed these things. We shouldn't forget about it."

Never have I personally felt so subjectively placed among the people who endured it first hand. Understandably, teachers try their hardest to explain the true horrors of the slavery period, but this film successfully tied up any possible loose ends that the textbooks could have failed to subject us to. The abduction of free northern men to serve Southern slavers is a literal black market, but 12 Years A Slave emphasizes that it's part of a larger business, where bodies are sold to work in the fields and traded to settle debts, and white men are allowed to handle their ""property"" any way they wish. Whatever moral misgivings they might have can be justified by the legitimacy of paperwork, both legal and Biblical. It's just business, and Solomon is no more or less significant than a cog in the machine."

","Sure, almost all of us have been informed about the cruelties of slavery. All of us have been told of the horrors. All of us have acknowledged the tremendous things one human have done to one another. But not a single person alive today has been able to experience and fully understand WHY it must have been horrible. Films and novels like this are one of the few sources we can use to get as close as we can to this full understanding. Many cannot even comprehend what society as a whole was like during the era of slavery. 12 Years a Slave paints a broad spectrum of the current society in America at the time. It touches on the mentality of these people and allows us to see why the people are doing what they're doing. Not just scratching our head like the common person saying ""Why would you do such a horrible thing."" Although enslaving the blacks is not likely to occur ever again in America, this film is necessary in understanding not to make similar mistakes and not to fall into the wrong mentality based on personal bias. Seeing things level headed such as Bass and Solomon do is an important skill that can be learned after careful analysis of this movie and similar movies."

","12 Years a Slave details the life of Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays Solomon Northup very well, capturing the classy man before slavery as well as the man that was put into slavery. The horrors of slavery were shown to be life-changing, turning Northup into a completely different man than he was before his kidnapping. He was forced to witness many atrocities in his 12 years as a slave. One such atrocity was from Master Epps and his treatment of his slave Patsey. I won't go into details, but these sorts of atrocities very clearly affected Solomon. Master Epps was a horrifying character in the way he acted towards his slaves, and Michael Fassbender did an excellent job portraying him. One problem that I had with this movie was its portrayal of race. Although it is a movie about slavery, that doesn't mean that every white person (except for Brad Pitt of course) has to be so evil, and likewise, not every black person is as nice. Despite this I thought that 12 Years a Slave was a very good movie, and I would give it a 9 out of 10."

","12 Years A Slave follows the documented experiences of Solomon Northup, a free African- American who is wrongfully kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South. The film is based off of Northup's autobiography published in 1853. <br/><br/>The film begins with Northup (portrayed by Ejiofor) living in Saratoga, New York with his family. After being offered a job by two men for his talents with the violin, he travels to Washington, D.C. with the pair. Shortly after arriving, he is drugged and taken to a slave pen. He finds that he is being referred to as an escaped slave from Georgia named Platt. When Northup exclaims that he is indeed a free man, he is beaten and told to never say such words again. <br/><br/>Throughout his twelve years, Northup is bound to two plantations. His first being owned by William Ford (Cumberbatch) who purchases him alongside a woman named Eliza (Oduye). She is separated from her children and is consumed by her misery. She has a significant exchange with Northup. When he tells her to quiet her weeping, she questions if he is going to assume the role of Platt from then on to which he replies, ""I survive! I will not fall into despair! I will offer my talents to Master Ford! I will keep myself hardy until freedom is opportune!"" This is a perfect example of his perseverance which is a common theme throughout the film. <br/><br/>After a confrontation with Tibeats (Dano), Northup is sold to the plantation of Edwin Epps (Fassbender). Unlike Ford, Epps is a sadistic man who enjoys the pain of his slaves. He is the only plantation owner who would agree to take in Northup. Life on Epps' plantation differs greatly from that on Ford's. Here he forms a bond with a slave named Patsey (Nyong'o). She is recognized for her ability to pick significant amounts of cotton in one sitting. Mistress Epps (Paulson) takes a disliking to her out of jealousy from the attention her husband gives the young slave. <br/><br/>Here Northup continues to work until his opportunity for freedom arrives. After he is leased to another plantation due to cotton worm, he meets Judge Turner (Batt). Later on, he receives money for using his experience with the fiddle to play for the neighbor of the Judge's wedding anniversary. With the money, he employs a former overseer to deliver a letter for him. This being an effort to reach his friends in New York to free him. However, he is betrayed and sold out to Epps. Northup avoids the wrath of the brutal slave owner by lying. <br/><br/>The opportunity for freedom rises again in the form of a gazebo. Northup is ordered to work on one with that of Samuel Bass (Pitt), a white man from Canada. Bass diverges from Epps' ideals. He does not understand how one could treat their slaves how he does. In a way, he opposes slavery all together. This mindset alone earns the trust of Northup. He asks the man to deliver his letter to which although he is worried by the risk involved, accepts the request. <br/><br/>Some time after this exchange, the sheriff arrives at the plantation. When Northup answers questions regarding his identity correctly, he is taken by the sheriff and returned to his family in the North. There, he is met by his now grown children, wife, and one grandchild. The movie closes with the family embracing each other for the first time in twelve years. <br/><br/>The film itself presents a significant principle; that each generation must not forget the events of those preceding theirs. There is much to learn from those who lived before you. One must know the past so that the rotten parts of it cannot be repeated. We, as a civilization, learn with growth. This message is delivered with aged offensive language, scenes of horrific practices, and ideals of those who believed in such customs. Captivating scenes of nature greatly juxtapose what occurs around it. Moments that deeply disturb the viewer are implemented as a teaching tool. The film displays gruesome conventions of the past to present the viewer with one idea; this must not be repeated. Inferiority among the races does not exist; we are all equal."

One of the things I appreciate about 12 years a slave is that the producers didn't sugar coat the horrors of slavery. Although we will never truly understand the adversities that slaves faced, this movie allows us to comprehend even a fraction of the pains that they had to live with. It was nearly painful to watch some of the more horrendous scenes such as when Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was forced to whip Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o).

","The art depicted in this movie perfectly captures this dark era of slavery. The viewers are constantly exposed to the harsh reality of what once was accepted. <br/><br/>One out of many important scenes was when the protagonist, Â¨Platt,Â¨ was being hanged after he had lashed out against one of the slave owners who regulated him and countless other slaves. His consequence was to be hanged in a long, drooling scene where he is shown being hanged while around beautiful nature scenery. The scene lasted around two to five minutes and in doing this the movie really amplified the idea of suffering these enslaved people were having to endure.<br/><br/>Another example of this would be the scene where the mother was forced away from her two children, never to see them again. She was placed in an auction house with her son and daughter and, if asked, would have to show their physical ability like the son had to by running in place doing high knee exercises. This showed how this enslaved race was viewed as mere objects and it really hit home with the idea that these white slave owners were soulless beings who can just rip a family apart and destroy lives in order to make some money. <br/><br/>The moral of the story is these white slave owners neglect to remember that the lives of others are truly priceless and there is no amount of money or possessions that the human experience can be valued with."

"brookeafisher","10","0","1","20 December 2015"," 12 Years a Slave takes viewers through a journey of the South during the Civil War, including the harsh reality of life as a slave.
","Based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free citizen of New York who is sold into slavery, comes a provocative film which represents the cruelties of slavery in a captivating fashion. Viewers see for themselves what the life of a slave entailed, including unjust whippings, desperation, and fierce racism which was completely accepted at the time. This adaptation of the South during the Civil War is unsettling to say the least. We see slaves stripped of all of their dignity and treated like they are less than human, slaves separated from their families to be worked to death on plantations, and the lack of resolution when it comes to slavery. At the end of the film, we read that Northup was unable to bring justice to the situation as he was unable to testify in court against his kidnappers.<br/><br/>The most startling scenes of the film include raw crimes of humanity, such as lynchings, rape, and whipping of slaves. Solomon Northup, who assumes the slave name ""Platt,"" is almost hanged himself after Tibeats, a plantation over looker, accuses him of not following instructions. Tibeats attempts to hang Platt, but is stopped because he does not own Platt and therefore would be doing a disservice to the plantation owner. Instead of letting Platt return to his work, Platt is kept in the noose holding himself up by his tiptoes for what must have been hours until his Master returns and cuts him down. After this, Platt tells his owner that he is actually a free citizen and not a slave. His owner is unable to listen to this, and Platt is sold to Master Epps and taken to his plantation.<br/><br/>At Master Epps plantation, we are introduced to Patsey, a female slave who picks upwards of 500 pounds of cotton a day without fail. Patsey is the main recipient of Master Epps angered affection, which we see in an extremely unnerving scene where Patsey lies lifeless as Master Epps rapes, slaps, and chokes her. Later on, Mistress Epps refuses to give Patsey soap because she is jealous of the relationship between she and her husband. When Patsey returns, Master Epps makes Platt brutally whip Patsey as he and his wife look on in sadistic pleasure. <br/><br/>More aspects of slave society that we see first hand are slaves inability to read or write, as well as their work and mourning songs. When Mistress Epps asks Platt if he learned to read from his previous owner, he tells her that he was only taught a few words here or there. In response, she says ""Don't trouble yourself with it... Any more will earn you a hundred lashes."" In one of the most moving scenes of the film, we see a group of slaves singing 'Roll Jordan Roll' to mourn a fellow slave who died working in the cotton fields. We see that the hope for slaves to ever experience anything other than cruelty is so weak that their only hope is for salvation in the afterlife. <br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is an evocative film that represents slavery in its purest form- in a way that all people can understand its brutality. The film is successful in making viewers extremely uncomfortable and sometimes forcing them to look away because it is hard for us now to envision a world where something like this actually occurred."

The characters in the movie do an amazing job portraying the injustice of the time period and provide insight to the fact that slaves were considered nothing more than property. Plantation owners justified their acts by telling themselves they had the, ""right to do as they pleased with their property,"" and they never received any repercussions for their actions. <br/><br/>On top of the great portrayal of the hostilities of the slave owners, the movie also is also successful representing the time period. The movie shows the unlawful acts that took place under the Fugitive Slave Acts in 1850. African Americans, free or runaway, were captured and put into slavery.

"dave-mcclain","8","0","1","3 December 2015"," ""12 Years a Slave"" offers a fresh and very human perspective on slavery.
","One problem with movies about slavery is that, in order to portray its dehumanizing evils, there seems to be no way around dehumanizing its characters. ""12 Years a Slave"" (R, 2:14) manages to solve this problem. While making the lives of slaves look and feel more real than most portrayals of the subject, this film also manages to humanize the slaves' suffering â€“ and underlying dignity â€“ more effectively than I've ever seen it done before. Besides all this, the film educates its audience about a topic as well-known as slavery by showing a permutation of its injustice that has rarely, if ever, appeared on screen before.<br/><br/>This film tells the true story of Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an educated, black middle-class family man who lived in upstate New York, until he was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South. He ends up serving two different masters (Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender). The former is relatively kind and the latter is very cruel (but, interestingly, both are seen using the Bible â€“ in different ways â€“ to keep their slaves under control, one of the many ways in which this film smartly puts slavery's injustices and contradictions on full display). Solomon encounters a variety of other people who are party to his confinement and occupy various spots on the morality continuum (including brief but powerful performances by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano and Brad Pitt). Solomon's intelligence helps him to survive, but does little to solve the problem of his captivity. It's not that he doesn't try to regain his freedom, but the system is so stacked against him that every idea he considers and every plan he hatches crumbles before his eyes, steadily eating away at his remaining hope of freedom.<br/><br/>The film's title makes it obvious that Solomon isn't still a slave at the movie's end. How that freedom comes about is the question (for those of us previously unfamiliar with the history on which the film is based). Does Solomon escape? Is he freed by a sympathetic master? Is he discovered in captivity by someone who knows that he was a free man? Does his freedom come as naturally as it did for millions of other slaves in the Antebellum South - by death? Whether you know the ending, figure it out during the course of the movie or just sit back and absorb the story as it unfolds, Solomon's experiences in his brutal and tragic enslavement, offer plenty to watch as we wait to see how these 12 Years will end.<br/><br/>This film's uniqueness in its depiction of slavery is brilliantly executed by screenwriter John Ridley and director Steve McQueen. Ridley's dialog effectively portrays the relative intelligence of his disparate characters and reminds us of the eloquence with which many Americans used to speak, sounding almost Shakespearean at times. McQueen makes the audience feel like they're part of the action by bringing his camera in very close at certain carefully chosen moments, and pacing the film in such a way that the characters' emotions become our own, including the very uncomfortable feeling of being off balance, not knowing what's coming next. The star's performance was so strong that, when the 2013-2014 awards season arrived, we all had to learn to pronounce Chiwetel Ejiofor, much as, one year earlier, we had to learn the name of the young ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" star QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis (who, interestingly, is also in this film). Although ""12 Years a Slave"" drags at times and stages its final scene rather awkwardly, overall, the film is a masterwork of story-telling and emotional resonance. ""A-"""

","The movie was sensational. It has some of the best acting I've seen in a long time. The setting and horrors of what slavery was like in the 1800 is excellent. The story was very interesting and good. A freed slave and his wife moved to a free state. He from their was educated and started his own family. He was very successful in educating him self and his wife. He was then captured and brought back to a plantation.<br/><br/>He was trapped their for years has his family grew and got older.

","12 years a slave is a very powerful and moving epic story. It's obviously a stain on the collective history of humankind that such barbaric slavery as depicted in this movie was allowed to be carried out. I could feel shame just watching it. What this movie does is really highlights the stupidity and futility of such slavery. The people captured and forced to be slaves are naturally exasperated, hopeless and diminished. They rightfully cannot understand such inexplicable cruelty. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o give stellar performances as they confront the horror and depravity of slavery. The land owners who control the slaves are depicted as bullies, but we also see their human side. Their blinded, twisted take on gospel scriptures that enables them to manipulate their own minds and feelings. Their false sense of entitlement spurred by financial motivation. And for me the most important part of their depiction - their equal confusion to deal with the effects of such brutal slavery. Paul Dano's short but impressive depiction of the blind anger created by fear. Paul Giamatti's educated man turning a blind eye. Benedict Cumberbatch's blushing exploitation. This movie enables us to study those who took part in the enslaving of others. Why did they? How could they? And we see from religion to blind rage how some were able to suppress any feelings that this was a great wrong they were committing. None more so than Michael Fassbender who for me stole the show with his depiction. It should have been Chiwetel Ejiofor but Fassbender was so honest in his portrayal. So blinded, desperate and flawed. So confused in his feelings. He held absolutely nothing back and in doing so created an unforgettable movie character. The scene that captured this most for me was at night with his lantern confronting Solomon. He was utterly manic. We're not impressed by his character. We are disgusted. But Fassbenders portrayal of this character is so impressive that it helps us to see the human behind this monster. Which helps to remind us that it was humans that did this. Whatever their reasoning and thought processes - human beings committed such atrocities. And for me this is a very sobering thought."

","After watching Steve McQueen's Shame (2011) my expectations from 12 Years a Slave were rather low. The heist surrounding it during the Academy Awards didn't help. Well, i must admit i was wrong. 12 Years a Slave is an excellent movie.<br/><br/>From what i knew about the period and circumstances, i'd say tat 12 Years a Slave offers a reasonable level of historical and factual accuracy. The story of slavery is hopefully well known, but what makes this movie even more horrific is the fact the main protagonist has been kidnapped as a free man and sold to slavery.<br/><br/>There were two things, though, that disturbed me slightly.<br/><br/>One is the depiction of violence. I understood that this as merely a depiction of reality. Yet it felt as if 12 Years a Slave followed a trend in contemporary cinema where graphic violence seems to be a regular staple in every movie with artistic aspirations.<br/><br/>The other thing was a rather superficial case against the legal system of the era. It allowed the slavery to flourish and the violence against slaves was merely its byproduct. Just as an example, the main protagonist failed to achieve anything through legal action against the people who kidnapped him. And this happened in those ""progressive"" parts of USA.<br/><br/>However, these two things were small in comparison with the rest of the movie."

","Once in a while, a film comes along, which is so intense and dramatic in its content, that watching it once is enough in your lifetime. ' 12 years of Slave' directed by Steve Mccqueen, is one such very rare film, it is movies at its disturbing and brutal best. It is that kind of a movie which is brilliant in all aspects, but however it may never make it your list of personal favourite films,just because of the fact that you may never want to see it again,go through that emotionally draining experience again,but as i mentioned at the start, therein lies the film's success, given it is about slavery, which is not meant to be enjoyed at all. '12 years a Slave' is based on the biography of Solomon Northup,who was abducted and sold as a slave, despite being a freeman. The movie illustrates his journey from one plantation to another, his experiences, the characters he meets, his longing to get back to his family. Ejiofor plays Solomon, in what can definitely be the role of his lifetime,and he is excellent throughout.His eyes which truly reflect the horror all around him,gives the movie its emotional weight.He is particularly excellent in scenes in which he does not speak, and there are a whole lot scattered throughout. The plantation owners are Ford (Cumberbatch),who is good at heart, but cannot gift his freedom to Solomon, and Epps (Fassbender),a sadistic and alcholic, a 'nig*** breaker'. Cumberbatch is good as always, but it Fassbender who is extremely menacing throughout, which makes the movie all the more disturbing and terrifying, the movie would never been the same without Fassbender. Lupita Nyong'o as 'Patsy' is good too, Brad Pitt,one of the producers plays a heroic cameo too. Hans Zimmer's musical score and picturesque locations which contrasts with the disturbing scenes, only elevate the film. Do watch ' 12 years a Slave', as Pitt's Bass puts it to Solomon in the film after hearing his story "" It is amazing....not in a good way"". I double that. Rating:10/10"

","This movie was a beautifully rendered piece of history. Showing how Solomon Northup was thrown into the life of a slave from a life of which had both comfort and the opportunity that showed itself everyday- the opportunity to live. Throughout his struggles, Soloman never gives up hope, and that's an important lesson for us all. He trusted few and although he tried, regularly failed to keep his head down and mouth shut. Finally, his faith and devotion to being free again pays off, bringing him home to what he once had, 12 years later. Symbolism used in this movie was subtle, however beyond amazing. When he hangs from the rope when one man decides that he can take his life, however wrong he is, time passes slowly for the viewer, showing just how unimaginably long it is for Solomon, having to take the slow way around, one day at a time."

No it should be seen to remember how we, the human kind can be so monstrous and evil towards each other.<br/><br/>Unfortunately still today, slavery is still present and this is a shame in this world today that such evil practice is still going on.<br/><br/>It is also making you feel ashamed of being American, a citizen of a country which ways of life and thinking is based on freedom and equality. Knowing that we needed a bloody war which tore us apart for 4 years to end Slavery is really giving you chills.<br/><br/>Through Solomon Northup, Steve McQueen is telling us the story of hundred of thousands men, women and children who saw their freedom and dignity brutally taken away by evil men who considered them as property and never as human beings. There are scenes who will literally break your hearts and hurt your feelings like the one where Solomon and other black people were sold to their future masters. When you see this woman getting separated of her children then checked and treated like a beast is sickening but it was the truth and it needed to be shown. Or this poor young woman who is whipped and tortured by the jealous wife of her owner.<br/><br/>Slavery is evil and it is hard to understand how we could be such despicable monsters.<br/><br/>So yes this movie is necessary for memory and to make sure that such evil will never be practiced again.

","It has become my practice to review any movie that I see that deserves to be reviewed. Sometimes, I face this task with trepidation or boredom. I will not deny it. But for the second time (The Wind Rises being the first), I face the prospect with not just excitement but downright glee. I suppose since it won Best Picture, any quote-unquote 'serious film-goer' in America has seen it already. But it still should be said that this is a movie that deserves to be seen. Though this film may not have been my choice for Best Picture, it is my honor and pleasure to say that it is a worthy best picture winner. For once, I don't think anyone could reasonably believe that the Academy got it wholly wrong.<br/><br/>Let me say that I did not come into this movie thinking I would wholeheartedly like it. I have been worn down by a lot of slavery movies, not all of them good. I don't quite know how to explain it to you non-Americans because while I am exposed to many of the great films from other countries, I am only rarely exposed to the mediocre ones. I suppose the closest comparison I can come to is Holocaust Films, which pop up internationally.<br/><br/>Like the Holocaust, slavery is a painful but important chapter that needs to be talked about. But also like the Holocaust, there are a glut of mediocre films about slavery. And they have no passion in them, no sense of purpose or motive. It's like people thought, ""Hey Jimmy, we need a movie that's not too controversial, has a simple narrative so that people will know who to cheer for, and will get us some Oscar cred along the way. Let's make it about the Holocaust/slavery."" And many of these movies just come down to shoving how awful slavery/Holocaust is in our face. We know already. We're not idiots, no matter what Trans4mers' box office receipts may say.<br/><br/>It disgusts me. It really does. These people have no idea what they're talking about. I am offended as a history-lover, a cinemaphile, and a person.<br/><br/>This film is the cure. But it's so much more than all that. It's a cinematic epic. It's the kind of movie that will hold its place in cinematic history and be watched time and time again. Grand in its vision and nuanced in its execution, it is one of the best movies of year and one that will rightfully end up on many best of the decade lists. There have been good movies about slavery before this. There have been important movies about slavery before this. But until this film, there has not been a film about slavery that I would put in the highest echelon of film (top 100). In that way, it is the Schindler's List of slavery movies.<br/><br/>For about fifteen minutes, I thought this was going to be merely an above-average slavery film. Then I thought it was going to be great slavery film. Then I just let go of my expectations and let this film consume me, fully. The cinematography is as elegant as it is humble. There are some stunning shots of sunlit trees or caterpillars, but there is nothing ridiculously artsy. Not that I hate ridiculously artsy... but this movie didn't need that and it knew it didn't need that. Some films pound you with their style. This one serenades you with it.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is how well of a storyteller it is. In writing circles, we say that there are two kinds of writers: stylists and storytellers. Many of the first kind are world-renowned. But people keep coming back to the work made by the second kind and for good reason... it is more fulfilling. I do not take back the glowing review I gave to Birdman last week, but I knew that there was something missing in that movie. It was this... an absence of storytelling at its highest level.<br/><br/>This movie gets right one of the often-overlooked aspects of making a film like this: the realism. I don't use that word like some do: I don't mean that it doesn't sugarcoat, though for the most part it doesn't. I mean that it shows it like it was, with all the nuance and peaks and valleys. I also don't mean that it is perfect in accuracy to reality. It knows that dramatic license isn't something to fall back on... it's a tool to communicate the feel of a film. And no other film could so capture the essence of this period and, more importantly, the essence of this man's life. One doesn't need to rely on sugarcoated clichÃ©s to inject passion in a film. Steve McQueen and his crew know how to do this.<br/><br/>They are helped by great acting. I don't have the space to list the nuances of all the great performances. I'll just say that this is, all-around, one of the best-acted films ever. Everyone who got a Oscar nom or nod deserved it. They are fiery, vulnerable, complex without being diluted. Simply superb.<br/><br/>This is not the best movie ever. The first act drags a bit and there are times when something seems a little off and there are some scenes that should have been added for grand or intimate effect and some that should have been cut to tighten the film. But all in all, this is a film that deserves to be called great and a landmark and stunning and oh so much more. Perhaps above all else, it lifts in a real way (not the fake, simple quotey way) out of despair."

","12 Years A Slave (2013): Dir: Steve McQueen / Cast: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt: Emotionally powerful film about a life torn from its normality and thrust into extreme oppression. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, a carpenter and fiddle player who is sold into slavery after being misled into another gig. Away from his family he keeps to himself yet still receives brutal treatment by those whom see him as property to do with as will. Set in 1841 director Steve McQueen addresses individuals who were freed and taken from their lives in the name of greed and corruption. He previously directed Shame another film about an individual trapped in a lifestyle with hopes of escape. Ejiofor holds strong during the tough times yet striving with the hope of eventually regaining his freedom. Michael Fassbender plays a racist plantation owner named Edwin Epps whose wife is jealous with his constant sexual flings with Patsey, one of the slave girls. Lupita Nyong'o plays Patsey, in constant pain with several sexual assaults as well as abuse from Epps's wife. She is eventually whipped nearly to death with Epps forcing Solomon to do the deed. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Solomon's first owner who tries to protect his interest but eventually has to sell him to Epps. Brad Pitt plays a listening and sympathetic ear that results in him taking a risk to do what is right. Director McQueen creates an emotionally draining film that really captures the era and one man's strong hold of twelve years before his hope becomes a reality. Score: 10 / 10"
"carter-47153","10","0","1","24 August 2015"," The Legacy of America
","Slavery. This distinctly human invention has built empires, maintained economies and has allowed the destruction of empires and society. Slavery has made it's appearance in every corner of the Earth in one form or another. For some it has been brief while others it has lasted longer and some have changed a society; even affecting social and economic growth. Throughout history, slavery has occurred in order to expand territories and governments, harvest natural resources and provide soldiers. In some cases, slavery was so prevalent that there were more slaves than citizens referred to as masters. This was the case with Ancient Rome and eventually led to their downfall.<br/><br/>The North American continent was founded as a means to find freedom from persecution, religion and other parts of life that were not being fulfilled within an already established government. Once a foothold was established in the beginning colonies it become apparent that in order to tame the land, provide a boost to the fledgling economy and defend themselves from the new dangers that the continent held; the ""Americans"" would need to establish a slave trade in the New World.<br/><br/>This decision had the expected impact as there was an entire continent of available slaves that could be sent to America as part of an economic trade. This would eventually make an entire half of a new nation completely dependent upon a property-based labor system.<br/><br/>It is during this time period that the film, 12 Years a Slave takes place. The events follow a free African American man who is abducted and sold into slavery and must find a way to persevere until his freedom is regained. The American film industry has a history of producing movies that focus on the American Civil War, and other films that investigate the themes that are created in a situation such as the one described above. The previously produced themes have focused on freed African Americans serving in the army without recognition, or brother fighting brother in the war and the brutality of the life of a slave. Never has a film captured the raw cruelty, barbarism and natural crimes that had taken place during this period.<br/><br/>In this film, there is no salvation for these slaves. Only moving from one slave owner to another do their terms of life change. The cruelty and punishments that they endure simply as a consequence of living can be difficult to watch. The shame and sorrow that the audience may feel during this film is undeniable. The most important thing to take away from that can be taken away from the journey that one has to face during the course of this film is how the enduring legacy of America continues to this day and it is a legacy that has changed the world and continues to ruin people's lives no matter the culture."

","English is not my mother tongue, please excuse any errors on my part.<br/><br/>I haven't watched a lot of movies about slavery, but this one is definitely my favorite. A mixture of a talented cast, a compelling plot and a wonderful cinematographer created a highlighted sense of reality. I am not a black, therefore I can't say I totally understand what slavery can do to humanity. But when Soloman struggles to keep his footing while being hanged by Tibeats, my breath was totally taken away. Along with nearly five minutes of that long, stead shot, I felt I was experiencing slavery from the first-person perspective. In this sense, both Solomon's pain and hope became mine. I came to realize slavery is evil in a sense that it not only brings pain and misery to the slave, but also brings out the bad side and dark nature in the slaver.<br/><br/>From my point of view, the best performance came from Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyon'o and Michael Fassbender, their wonderful performance and wholehearted dedication took us on an emotional journey through the dark history of slavery.<br/><br/>Though it is a great movie, but it still shares some shortcomings with other movies of the same genre. This movie took too much time to illustrate the cruelty of slavery which keeps people on their toes, but the problem is that the tension never lets up since Solomon gets kidnapped. It would serve me better if once in a while, we can get a moment of light relief away from all the depression and sadness, so we can better identify with Solomon's plight. After numerous representations, the incessant miseries almost become expected. During watching this movie, I actually felt a short moment of boredom.<br/><br/>Is it just me or does the movie end too abruptly? It could have provided more details to describe how Solomon finally escaped slavery. Because after almost two hours of watching Solomon endure all the pain and hardship, it is difficult to convince me that he can regain freedom in only 15 minutes. I understand the difference between the time in movie and the time in real life, however it still gives me a feeling that Solomon's freedom comes at a cheap price.<br/><br/>Despite all the disadvantages , watching the movie still gives me great pleasure.<br/><br/>Once again, I apologize for any mistake in my English."

","It strikes me that one of the best movies of last year was Tarantino's exploitation, revenge flick 'Django Unchained' revolving around slavery in a brutal yet stylized way. Arguably one of the best movies of this year '12 Years' is another brutal exploration of slavery in the pre-Civil War south yet it's brutality comes from the very realistic aspect of its presentation. The story surrounds a free black man living in upstate New York who gets duped, kidnapped and sold into slavery. From there the audience is continually presented with a myriad of archetypes illustrating the harsh reality of this institution that we as a nation allowed to exist and stain our soul for a hundreds of years from the establishment of the colonies through the birth of the nation. The film is simply shot allowing for the gravitas of what's occurring on the screen, the character interaction and the depth of the performances to truly sink in. The performances as a whole are impeccable and amazing to behold. To watch this and understand it is to imagine a world without hope; a world where men are not created equal; a world in this day and age seems foreign and strange although we still fought civil rights battles well into the 1960's and 70's. More than anything watching something like this gives true appreciation to those who fought so hard and so long and laid down their lives to bring us to a place where we could understand slavery for the abomination that it is."

","I have seen many movies about slavery but none of them have explored it to this extent. Some of the parts of the movie that really touched me were the one in which the slaves sang the song ""Roll Jordan Roll"" and the part in which Solomon was reunited with his family, the score composed by Hans Zimmer playing in the background almost made me cry. I've seen two previous movies of Steve McQueen ""Hunger"" and ""Shame"", both of them explore struggles of men at a critical level, the first one is about the Irish hunger strike in the prisons of Ireland a.k.a ""The Troubles"" and the latter being the exploration of the sex addiction of an New York executive who is later joined by his sister who is also struggling in life from being unemployed and other social factors. McQueen went on to win the CamÃ©ra d'Or which is like a best director award for first time filmmakers for Hunger. <br/><br/>The way this movie was made was another factor which touched me. The way McQueen edited the movie by showing the audience how Solomon went on from being a free man to a slave just like that by shifting between a very few scenes which affected the audience by putting them in that situation. Because most of the black people were slaves they were considered inferior by whites, they felt that it was alright for them to be enslaved. The truth is that Black people didn't have a chance to do anything because the whites wouldn't let them do anything like no schooling, no voting rights. Whites had an advantage because none of them had to work, all of their wealth was inherited from their parents and their parents before them. The acting of Micheal Fassbender in this movie was worthy of being awarded the best actor, I really don't understand why he wasn't awarded for his performance. The only bad cast member for this movie was Brad Pitt. McQueen had to cast him because he was the main producer and he wouldn't disrespect him by not casting him in that movie. Slavery is an important part of history of not only African-Americans but also Africans because wherever went they were treated like dirt and second class citizens. I hope that every person who sees this movie will realize that when they look at Africans as inferior they are forgetting a large era of their suffering.

","Slavery is a subject that Hollywood doesn't touch enough. It was one of the most grim periods in American history. Slavery, however, is realistically demonstrated in this historical drama, based on a novel and real-life tale. Chiwetel Eijofor plays Solomon Northup, a free African-American husband and father of two, who is devastatingly stripped of his innocence when he betrayed by white men and sold into slavery. There, Northup struggles trying to survive the harsh reality of slavery in the Louisiania plantation, run by William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). <br/><br/>Set in the 1850-60s, this film pulls absolutely no punches when depicting an image of slavery. The film is quite difficult to watch at times, especially since it is based on a true story. It is harrowing to watch how African Americans were treated so brutally, and how they were helpless against how these plantation owners deal with them with such callous attitude. It was painful to watch these innocent people being tied to trees, being whipped repeatedly with tremendous force, and being strangled to death. It is also harsh to see how the main character is psychologically torture by these men to the point where he gets forced to hurt some of his own people. Nonetheless, I was fascinated by how beautifully this was filmed, and the performances the actors give. Chiwetel Eijofor gave a mesmerizing performance as Solomon Northup, and the way he shows his emotions in many scenes gives his character a powerful feel. Michael Fassbender also showed some good talent as the plantation owner, Edwin Epps. We are also offered a brief, but memorable cameo by Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Yes, this film is very brutal but that is what makes it powerful. This film is not only the best film dealing with slavery, or perhaps one of the films of the decade so far. If you happen to come across this film, you definitely need to watch it."

","12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime – film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.<br/><br/>Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism.<br/><br/>Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.<br/><br/>Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet.<br/><br/>There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools.<br/><br/>To watch 12 Years a Slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. To say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial, as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like Gone With the Wind or silly exploitation from something like Django Unchained. Both of which serve to make the topic digestible. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. It's a film of such ugliness, such blunt emotional trauma, that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. So why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? Because, it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time."

","I rarely ever give extraordinary notes but this must the be by far the most difficult movie I've had to watch in a long time. Many times I was speechless and even had to avoid watching certain sequences of the movie by turning my head away in front on the rough strong reality - ; especially the one where Lupita was flogged to blood ; of the strong ambiguous period of the US when the southern states continued slavery when the northern ones had already done about it.<br/><br/>What made this film difficult for me is the fact that there was no escape, no hope [...] throughout the whole movie when you wished, you begged, you thought that they would somehow revolt and run away. Even if when he escapes through the help of one of his friends and that letter he sent, the others were still continuously made slaves.<br/><br/>This film is really one of many reality check to some of these societies about how they were able to treat fellow human beings as animals for so many years without feeling any remorse.<br/><br/>It's really difficult to put words on this masterpiece. It's really difficult to explain the feelings after watching such a movie - a mix of pain, sadness, crying, silence, anger [...] damn. It's been long since a movie made me feel like that. And, I'm not even certain I would watch it for a second time with a straight face. 12 years a slave is though on you in a brilliant way no doubt about it."

","So I finally got around to seeing 12 Years a Slave, and now that I've wiped the tears from my face, I can tell you I was a little disappointed! Don't get me wrong. I'm glad I watched it. I liked certain things about the directing (like the fact that McQueen didn't plaster the movie with music) but the whole thing, the whole production, struck me as somewhat empty. There weren't those little details that bring a story, and especially a time period, to life. Life in the slave quarters, in particular, was lifeless. You can argue that that's because all the slaves were reduced to zombies, but I think it might be more a lack of imagination on the writer's part. In general I felt that where the source material didn't give any information, the movie-makers failed to fill in the gaps without resorting to cliché. I definitely want to read the autobiography now, though.<br/><br/>In a weird way it was like a melding of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto (or however you spell it). 12 Years had the lingering sadomasochism of the Passion (Polansky proved you don't need to dwell on torture to make an audience feel it), at the same time it was a rousing survival story like Apocalypto. How can you not root for Platt! Every time he got his hands on some sneering racist villain I cheered! But I was disappointed in the end, because say what you will about Mel Gibson, he knows how to conjure up the weirdness of a different world.<br/><br/>Also, you gotta love how Brad Pitt, who produced the movie, gave himself the best white role."

It had me crying at the end when Solomon returns to his family to see them 12 years older, I couldn't imagine what that would be like.

","I feel that the movie really portrays the feelings of the time period and its hardships. The detail in the movie was so moving and vividly showed the pain slaves had to endure in the time period. If you do not enjoy violent and graphic movies I do not suggest this movie. Even though it was great it was pretty graphic in showing what the slaves went through. I got chills and felt horrible during the movie because it was graphic. Because it is based on a real event and book written by Solomon Northrup, I was really able to realize how these harsh things were a reality for African Americans at that time period.

","One thing I have learnt about film making is that if you can make your audience feel then you have a winner, whether that be by laughter, sadness, grief it doesn't matter, all that matters is you make them feel. I have seen many films that have made me feel something but the ones that have stuck with me over the years are the films I consider to be some of my all-time favourites. I'm still undecided whether 12 Years a Slave will fall into one of my favourites of all time but if it does it will only because of one reason<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is based on a true story told by Solomon Northup the year is 1841 Solomon Northup is a free African American who makes a living by being a great violinist, he is well educated and what is very rare for that time he knows how to write and spell. Solomon is married and has two young children. One day he is approached by two men who ask him to join them in a trip to Washington DC to play a two week gig with his violin. Not long into the trip the two men drug Solomon and sell him into slavery. Solomon's name is changed to Platt by the slaver as well as where he is from which is now Georgia, he is sold to a plantation owner named Ford who looks after Platt quite well once he learns that he is a smarter than he lets on, unfortunately though there others who feel that it is their God given write to treat ""niggers"" as animals and go about doing just that. Platt is eventually sold on to protect himself to a malicious man Edwin Epps from here it's about Platt surviving anyway he can.<br/><br/>As I stated earlier this is a film designed to make you feel, and it does It so well, I guarantee you have a mix of emotions running through you from the opening to the credits and for me that is what makes an amazing film. The director Steve McQueen has only a few films under his belt but a whole lot of shorts and I fell he has done an amazing job, he hasn't done anything over the top its actually a very simple shoot. What he has done well is keep it simple, easy to follow, edgy and brutally honest. The beatings in this film can only be compared to ""The Passion of the Christ"" in their brutality and severity. The true heroes though are the actors, which I think every one of them have done an amazing job. Chiwetel Ejiofor (2012, Children of Men) is outstanding as Solomon Northup/Pratt, I can't help but imagine what the guy must have felt shooting some of those scenes he had to endeavour but either way he was amazing. Michael Fassbender (X-Men, Inglorious Bastards) was equally as amazing in his role, again I honestly believe he would have had nightmares after portraying his character he was very intense and so brutal. There are many other actors who all deserve recognition I think the entire cast should hold their heads up high for what they have accomplished here. I found it a little slow in places but not enough to worry really especially the first 10mins.<br/><br/>This isn't a feel good for humanity film, this is a film that will make you hate yourself, it'll make you think about that last joke you told, it'll make you appreciate everything you have today. It is a film that will make you heart ache; so get the tissues ready. To sum it up it is an amazing film for all the wrong reasons."

The movie begins with him already in slavery, and within the first half hour, we watch as Solomon is deceived and drugged into slavery, and beaten. We watch as he is nearly hanged, as he is traded from a kinder master to one so despicable he is known as a ""slave breaker"". The movie follows his dark journey marvelously, and displays it amazingly. I can not remember the last time I watched a historical film as interesting or as captivating as this one. My eyes were glued to the screen, and I could not tear myself away from the movie. This film delivered a difficult topic without beating around the bush, and for that it should be applauded."

Many people think that you should hide from this sort of exposure. That we shouldn't have to ""relive"" this time. But what happens if you don't show people how ugly and disgusting it was? We can't blind people from the past or history could end up repeating itself. This movie is definitely not for younger viewers. It is a good movie for older teenagers and adults. It is raunchy and is not shameful with showing how slave owners harmed the slaves. I really liked how it had an owner in the movie that was a good man and protected his slaves. Even though slavery was horribly wrong, it shows the other point of view by the owners that they were taking care of their slaves, so it was okay. One thing I totally did not understand is why slave owners would kill their slaves. Most of them had the attitude that they were their ""property"" and that they ""paid good money for them"" so no one should take them. They just have way too much pride and even if one of the slaves breathed the wrong way they would get whipped. I recommend this movie to older high school classrooms and to all adults. It is a completely true story so it is great exposure to the horrible nature of that time."
"quyennguyencc16","10","0","1","5 January 2015"," A great story being told to the world.
","12 Years a Slave is a true story about a man named Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man, who lived in Saratoga, New York. During the 1840's, he was abducted and shipped to the south to be sold for slavery. The movie entails an emotional and thoughtful insight to the idea of slavery, before it ended.<br/><br/>In almost every scene of 12 Years a Slave, it conveys some sort of the truth of America's sin... Slavery. To this day of the film world, it, in my opinion, is one of the best movies to portray the life of slaves during the 1800's. It had brought out intense feelings and thoughts throughout the film. Those feelings and thought carried a sense of dignity and uncertainty as no one has really approached a something anything similar to this. <br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, who at one point was a free man from Saratoga, enjoying the company by his children and wife. Then a kidnapped slave sent to Washington D.C. to be passed on by masters the next. He fell into the life he never expected to see happen to him again.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is more than a story about a slave waiting to see his family once again, but a story about shame and terror to see the next day. Slaves were to be slapped, whipped, and hung if they were to disobey their new masters, in which many did. The film is the complete opposite to the average slavery film of them trying to escape, but about refusing to accept a failure, as if they have given up on their life because they don't see an end to what they have been brought to. <br/><br/>Between each of Solomon's masters, you can see the different types of slave owners there may be in the world of slavery. For example, Master Ford wasn't the typical slave owner, he cared for the safety of his slaves.Like when Soloman/Platt has started trouble by fighting one of the white men. Ford had two choices, to allow them to kill Solomon or sell him out to another Master in secret. Then there was Master Epps, who would torture and was downright evil. He was your typical slave owner, who didn't seem to care for others feelings but only if the work is to be done. Within both Masters, you may see the differences in which slave owners were in the past. <br/><br/>All in all, 12 Years a Slave was a tremendous film and was very deep in thought with the idea of slavery. The entire cast did an exceptional performance and I hope to see more from Chiwetel Ejiofor."

","Prior to watching 12 Years A Slave, I figured I knew what to expect. Talking about slavery in history, you hear over and over again about the brutal past of those persecuted by their race. However, listening is not the same as experiencing. 12 Years A Slave embarks the audience alongside Solomon's journey from being a free African man, kidnapped and sold into slavery and experiencing the cruelty faced upon him. With talented and sympathetic actors portraying the lives of those who unfortunately fell victim to the bitter side of humanity, makes this biographical film come to life.

","I thought that this film was excellent. The top notch acting as well as the way they present it and tell the truthful story of Soloman Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, who is abducted and sold into slavery. This film portrays the cruel treatment of slaves in such a realistic and gruesome manner. Watching the film almost makes it as if you were there with the slaves and watching them suffer, can be just as bad as how they are suffering. It's also intriguing as we follow Soloman along his journey through an array of ruthless and evil slave-owners how Soloman adapts to his life and how he changes through it. Although it can also be insulting to some as to how it portrays the white folk as the evil in the lives of the black, as that can be a hasty generalization to the majority of Caucasian race. However, the manner in which it is portrayed in really lets us feel what the slaves had to go through. Including this one extended scene in which a black girl is whipped over and over until her flesh begins to show for stealing a bar of soap. The director of this film really drives home his true intentions for what he wanted the film to be, by including several long and gruesome scenes or torture and rape. However the historical accuracy of this film makes it a must watch for those old enough to understand its content."
"Kaelgrant","9","0","1","4 January 2015"," Phenomenal Depiction of the Horrors during the Era of Slavery
","Throughout the film, many horrific scenes were portrayed to reflect on atrocities during the period of 1800's slavery. From the brutality of southern slave-owners to the treatment of once freemen. Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was once a freeman living in peace and happiness with his family, until being tricked and deceived and eventually being sent to a southern plantation. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender play two very different personalities of white slave-owners. This shows that while it is evident slavery was not a controversy in the south, some slave-owners took it upon themselves to make the task of slaves more manageable. <br/><br/>I am personally astounded by the level of mistreatment of slaves shown in the film. Slavery is thought of as a bad, morally bankrupt way of life, but 12 Years a Slave really opens up the eyes of the viewer by embedding pictures of true and accurate brutality done to humans no different than ourselves. I viewed slavery as what we are taught to view it as, but I never realized the level of horrors met by slaves in their everyday lives."

","Solomon's story being told and reenacted was a powerful way to show what slavery was like. The fact that it was a true story almost made you not want to watch it but I am glad that I did. You are able to see the struggles that really needed to be overcome in order to even have a chance to fight for liberation. The main character, Solomon, was a free man who was betrayed and sold into slavery. No one would ever believe him when he said that he was a free man with a family in Saratoga, and in some cases he was even punished for saying such. His luck turned when he met a white man (Brad Pitt) who was working for money at his masters house. Brad Pitt was able to contact the people on his hometown and they were able to take Solomon home. It was really interesting that he was a free man all that time, but it took 12 years for someone to believe him. It also was significant that he started working with the Underground Railroad after and very interesting that the time and cause of his death was unknown. Overall, the movie was intense and jaw- dropping. You will not believe this mans fight for the liberty he already has."

It was an awful thing, slavery, and the way this movie so accurately showed what these people went through for many years was incredible.

This movie does have a bit of nudity and sexual content. My main problem with this movie is that it's hard to tell when and where the events occur. After saying the year and area in the beginning (Saratoga NY, 1841), you never know when things are happening afterwords.

","12 Years a Slave is one of those films that will leave you shocked and teary-eyed. It's the sort of film that will have you talking about it for days. The film may be Oscar-bait, but that doesn't stop the film from being a powerful, unflinching take on the brutality of slavery in the Antebellum Period. The film is very hard to watch and some scenes, especially the violent whipping scenes, I had to turn away. But the film tells the dark side to American history in such a cold, unforgiving manner. That makes the film even more powerful and emotional as we view the exploits of the main character, Solomon Northup.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen's film chronologizes the twelve years that Solomon Northup, a free man from New York, spent in slavery. Northup is guided to Washington D.C under false pretenses and is wrongfully kidnapped and is forced to spend the next twelve years amongst many plantations and abusive overseers. This is the story of one man who tries to fight slavery while being forced to work as a slave.<br/><br/>The film has a great cast and while many of the actors don't have large parts, they are effective parts. Chiwetel Ejiofer finally has the chance to shine as a leading man and in turn, he delivers the best performance of his career. Other defining performances are Michael Fassbender as the malicious plantation owner, Paul Dano as an abusive overseer, and Lupita N'yongo as Fassbender's slave love interest. She is hardly in the film, but her last scenes are incredible and quite frankly, tortuous to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a brutal film to watch. It's hard to take about how people in this country suffered this way only a few centuries ago. Slavery is immoral and the film makes a that a big point. The film is brutal to watch because of the violent, disturbing content which features a good amount of blood. We currently live in turbulent times here in America, and this is a good film to watch as blacks are our equals and even 170 years after the events of the film, we still don't hold true to those standards. This is a fantastic film and one of the best, if not the best film of 2013. I rate this film 10/10."

"jennyyaucc16","9","0","1","22 December 2014"," An Atrocious Reality
","McQueen did an excellent job at demonstrating the true horrors of slavery. Based on a true story written by the protagonist, many appalling truths unknown to the world about slavery were uncovered in the movie. The protagonist, Solomon Northup, was a free man living in Saratoga, NY with his wife, Anne, and two children, Margaret and Alonzo. Defrauded by two travelers who invites him to go to Washington D.C, he is drugged and sold into slavery. Solomon wakes up in a cell and is told he is Platt, a runaway slave from Georgia. Despite his protests of being a free man, he doesn't have any papers to prove it. The movie then shows his first brutal beating. Along with him, there are numerous others sold into slavery from the North into the South. Eliza, a mother, was separated from her children. Solomon was first bought by Ford, a southerner that was kind to some extent compared to other slave owners. Although Ford was sympathetic, Platt still didn't escape being sold to another plantation owner. His new owners get worst and worst with increasing cruelness. His last stop was Edwin Epps, a plantation owner known for his cruel and brutal whippings and physical punishments. Rape, whippings, and lynchings were frequent appearances in the show. After being a slave for 12 years, he eventually regained his freedom through the help of a abolitionist.<br/><br/>Slavery has and always will be the stigma of American history. Although America was established as the nation of liberty and happiness, African Americans received anything but those. Being discriminated against due to the sole reason of their skin color, African Americans were ripped of their rights as human and even the bare minimum of food, shelter and life. The movie showed that the evils are everywhere and even under the eyes of the government in the north right at the capital. There are slave cells right in sight of the White House. Solomon represented the unforgotten hope that will always cling to the least bit of opportunity to freedom. During the 12 years of slavery, there was not one moment he didn't want yearn for liberty. How could one country declare themselves the land of the free when people are oppressed under the name of slavery? How could they enjoy the natural right to property when they are considered property themselves? How could one country fight for representation to taxation when their own people are stripped of the privilege to earn money and be taxed?<br/><br/>Two extremely compelling scenes that affected me the most were Patsey's beating and when Solomon finally reunited with his family 12 years later he was kidnapped. As much as Epps favored Patsey, he still didn't respect her at all to give her the basic right to explain and believe her or not beat her like any other slave. He declared whole right to her and treated her a strong possessive that exploded when she did anything with another guy. The struggle of Solomon whipping her himself was portrayed effectively and the image of her back just kind of shoved in my face how strong the pain was. Everyone can talk about slavery and all the horrors but until something's displayed, it's hard to imagine the clear image of human brutality. When Solomon saw his family again, the look was of disbelieve. He couldn't believe he actually saw them again after all the experiences he's gone through. That face he had when he had to ask his daughter about their lives that he missed out. He was stolen the precious time that he had from two fraudulent greedy men. Due to their selfishness and desire, Solomon loss 4,383 days from his priceless life and suffered an enormous amount of brutal and inhumane conditions."
"Cakepugsart","10","0","1","22 December 2014"," An amazing portrayal of a slave's life.
","This movie does an excellent job of showing what it was really like to be a slave. The main character, Solomon Northup, is originally a freeman until he is tricked by two men who sell him into slavery. All of his rights are taken away from him as he is sold into what will be the worst years of his life. He is forced to leave his family and friends behind, not knowing if he will ever see them again. His previous lifestyle and identity are to remain a secret in order for him to survive. Throughout his years as a slave he is sold from master to master, who continually get harsher. Beatings and death of other slaves are common, and he too experiences the pain of a whipping. An experience that scares him for life. To us freedom may not mean anything, we do not live with the risk of all of our rights being taken away suddenly. However, during the 1800's, freedom was a miraculous thing. It was the difference between a safe and good lifestyle, or one with pain and suffering. Solomon Northup lost his freedom, and was unable to gain it back again for 12 years. The only thing he wanted was his freedom, it meant everything in the world to him. Everyday that passed without his freedom, meant another day of hard labor, and another day away from his family. Ultimately McQueen does an amazing job portraying the life of slave. The actors and actresses make it feel like you are right there, and deliver a very emotional and moving performance.

","It's hard to review a movie like 12 Years A Slave, considering the amount of love this movie has gotten. It's the Best Picture winner for 2013. It's sitting at a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, among the highest rated movies by critics and audiences. What more can be said, other than the fact that all of these accolades are not only well deserved, but completely justified?<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is a phenomenal piece of work. It's captivating, compelling, frightening, often hard to watch, but in the end completely rewarding. It shows slavery in its true form and never sugarcoats or turns its back on the message it is trying to deliver.<br/><br/>There are some great performances here, many of which were nominated for and one of which won the acting Oscars. Chiwetel Ejiofor completely carries this movie and you long so much for him to get out of the situation he is in. Michael Fassbender plays the role of a sadistic slave owner, who you loathe every single time he is present on screen. One of the biggest surprises comes from Lupita N'Yongo, who at only 16 minutes of screen time becomes one of the most memorable characters in the whole story and proves that she deserved the Oscar she won. There are many other actors who show up briefly, such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt, and others, and they all do fantastic as well.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, 12 Years a Slave is a really realistic portrayal of slavery. As a result, many scenes are hard to watch. There is no holding back. The two whipping scenes in this movie are tough, the latter all captured in one take lasting about 4 minutes, and almost reach a ""Passion of the Christ"" level. There is also a lot of other horrific moments, such as hangings and rape, that will definitely be hard for the viewer to experience. However, at the same time, they are powerful and really puts you in that experience.<br/><br/>And everything technical about this movie is fantastic as well. Steve McQueen really impressed me with ""Shame"" back in 2011, and continues to show his potential of becoming one of this generation's best filmmakers. The camera work is excellent, sometimes going on long takes that submerge you into the setting. The production and costume designs look authentic, the writing is great, the musical score is engrossing and moving; 12 Years a Slave really excels in its technicality. However, it still keeps us rooted in its story which keeps up invested and looking for resolution until the very end.<br/><br/>Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a fantastic and powerful film, and could easily be this decade's ""Schindler's List."" It examines slavery in a realistic, albeit graphic approach, has great actors that keep you invested in the characters, and is structured and directed perfectly. It's a wonderful and moving movie, and while some may not be able to handle it, this will no doubt go down as one of the most powerful and thought-provoking movies to come out in a long time."

","Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave is one of those movies where you are not supposed to be entertained, but instead for you to get pulverized. The movie tells the true story of Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor in an Oscar nominated performance) a free citizen, and is a musician is having a normal life at his home in Saratoga New York, until the year 1841 where he is in the process of looking for a job in Washington D.C. and then then he gets drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery for a horrific 12 year period of time of torture, horror, and misery. But the good thing is only one of his slave masters was actually good t him and his name was Ford (played by Benedict Cumberbatch.) but too bad Solomon only has him as a slave master for only two years>) and Solomon was sold to Ford by a guy named Freeman (played by Paul Giamatti) in which Solomon is sold along with a girl named Patsey (played by Lupita Nyong'o in an Oscar winning performance.) Then after two years pass by Solomon and Patsey are sold to cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps (played by Michael Fassbender in an Oscar nominated performance.) along with his wife (played by a mean but brilliant Sarah Paulson) where they both get tortured, beat up, and Patsey gets raped in one scene. The way McQueen directs this movie is kind of like the way that Spielberg directed Schindler's List (1993), or Amistad (1997) (but to me this film is much better than Amistad.) but totally different. The movie is arguably the best movie of 2013 that really showed how horrible it was for black people who were enslaved by white people all because of their skin color, and fortunately none of that happens anymore even though there is still some racial prejudice going on the world a lot of times without even realizing it."
"brchthethird","7","0","2","14 November 2014"," Uncomfortable, but necessary viewing
","12 YEARS A SLAVE is one of the most uncomfortable viewing experiences I've had in recent memory. It wasn't because I felt guilty for something my ancestors may (or may not) have had responsibility for, but because occasionally I felt that the movie wallowed in its own misery. It also felt exploitative and emotionally manipulative at times. That said, if one does not come away from this absolutely detesting slavery as an institution, there is something truly wrong with you. Fortunately, this story has a happy(ish) ending. Otherwise, the oppressive atmosphere might have choked all the life out of the story. On a technical level, the movie is astounding. Steve McQueen is an auteur to watch, now having three critically praised films under his belt. I also loved the score by Hans Zimmer, which was stark when it needed to be, but also filled with tenderness and longing. There are also several Negro spirituals peppered throughout which were also uplifting. Overall, this is a must-see film, not just because it's won a lot of awards, but because it treats a touchy subject with the honesty it deserves. However, I wouldn't watch it more than once unless you're a glutton for punishment."

","The power of the adaptation of Solomon Northrup's memoir, directed by Steve McQueen and written by John Ridley, is time. Not just the time Northrup spent, or the time that slaves were already there for generations by this point of the 1840's, and that it was an institution completely set in its place, but in cinema. Case in point is when Solomon - aka 'Platt' by the slave-trader who put him away - is strung up following a fight with one of the 'masters' played by Paul Dano, and he would be hung but there's a problem with doing that without the main master on hand. So, Solomon is just left to hang. For hours. And McQueen fixes his camera on him hung up with a little dirt under his feet to keep him up... and people behind him, slaves, children, go on about their concerns and things. Only one dares come up to him, but only to give a quick drink of water.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave explores not only the wholly immorality and evil of slavery, but its pervasiveness in modern culture. It features some of the greatest cinematic metaphors, without any overbearance. Or, maybe, it IS over-bearing, like 'LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON!' and no one doing anything. In a sense Solomon up on the noose is a metaphor for racism in general, that it's such a common occurrence that people get used to it. The institution of enslavement and imprisonment is not too dissimilar here to that shown in The Shawshank Redemption - also about a man put falsely in bondage. The difference this time is that it's not for any wrongfully accused crime. Simply put, if Solomon wasn't black, this wouldn't have happened to him. Or to anyone.<br/><br/>Of course this story of a man being taken away from freedom and a family and an artistically nourishing life is inherently compelling n(he works as a fiddler, and music is made as a great point of reference in the film as far as being free or not in doing it). And it works for an audience as well; people can put themselves in those shoes, what if that happened to me? If this was from the perspective of, say, the character Patsy (Oscar winner Lupita Nyongo) then it would be too much for any audience outside of the those who could take relentless punishment. There may be some who watch the movie as it is and find it to be too much. Indeed the first time Solomon gets whipped is almost there, and is so harsh, to get the audience primed for what's to come. ""This ain't no joke,"" is missing in subtitles on the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/>This might make the movie sound too hammer-on-the-head about its message, but McQueen is a filmmaker in love with classical style. He doesn't cut too much, and every shot and length has its purpose. When he keeps a shot going for a while, like when the whipping of a particular character goes on for a while and to such a manic extent (including a pan to see the results) and it goes on for minutes, it's really about putting us there and the morality of it. If you cut, you lose the tension, you lose the realistic nature of what's going on in the drama. Adding to that the performers - and damn if Ejiofor, Fassbender, Nyongo and everyone else puts in their all, even in roles of limited screen time - are in those long takes and have to play all the emotions of these people, which are on land that once had slave plantations at that.<br/><br/>It's nothing short of harrowing, and by the end (spoiler, not really since, again, Northrup wrote a best-selling book about his time in bondage) real tears can be shed when he reunites with his family because there's no false sentiment. This guy went through hell. And we're put there for the catharsis, and for how it relates to today. What do we do if we look away from racism and aggression and horrors across the world? Up on the noose it's about that situation, but it could be anyone at any time. That's the power of the art on display here."

Second, hearing people say a movie is ""powerful"" has always been one of my major pet-peeves, but this expression has become the only way that I can justifiably summarize this film.

","12 Years A Slave tells the story of a free black man who was sold into slavery and remained a slave for 12 years before a chance encounter freed him. I love going to the cinema and in general it's a happy experience but this is easily the most depressing trip to the cinema I've ever had. 12YAS, which is in many ways even more depressing than Schindler's List, is a relentlessly unflinching and harrowing look at slavery which is crafted with great skill and brilliantly acted. Perhaps it is Oscar bait, but it genuinely deserved the awards attention it got. It's not a masterpiece or an all time classic though. It's slow and long, and there are various times when nothing is really happening and those scenes feel pointless as a result. Overall, it is a worthy film on a very depressing but important and rarely explored in cinema topic that gets most stuff right. Steve McQueen used to be an artist and it shows as his direction is excellent with a lot of stunning cinematography and effective long takes.<br/><br/>The acting is great, with all of the actors delivering loads of emotional power with only facial expressions. Although Chiwetel Ejofor and Michael Fassbender are great, Lupita Nyong'o steals the show and very deservedly won the best supporting actress Oscar. The script doesn't veer into pointless sentimentality and stays true to the source material. Although dull at times, 12YAS remains disturbing and brutally honest throughout. I wouldn't be able to face a second viewing, but I'm very glad I got the chance to see it. The ending is genuinely tear jerking and while it may have several viewers in tears, its tear jerking moments feels genuine and truthful. In many ways Gravity and Her were better movies and this may not be seen as a great classic in future but unlike other Oscar nominated films (Crash, Zero Dark Thirty I'm looking at you) this takes an important subject and actually turns it into excellent filmmaking instead of just delivering a message in a bland and manipulative way. Just don't expect any rays of sunshine. At all.<br/><br/>9/10"

","12 Years a Slave is an outstanding movie with an extremely well developed and beautifully written storyline and a fantastic cast.It is very dramatic and intense but it makes you aware of the cruelty that people had to go through in the 1800's just because they had a different skin colour,which is just awful and this movie shows what terrible torture these poor souls had to put up with from these racist people that sadly had a lot of power and wealth.The performances are without a doubt the highlight,Chiwetel Ejiofor was unbelievable in the lead role,he had to go through an awful lot playing this character but he stuck with it all the way through,and of course the Oscar winning performance of Lupita Nyong'o is brilliant,her characters scenes were the hardest to watch and she certainly deserved the award,and also Michael Fassbender is great,this was my first time seeing him play a character that wasn't any bit likable,we feel no sentimentality for him from the minute he enters the film to the minute he leaves,which is what made it such an incredible performance.Not for the faint of heart or anyone under the age of at least sixteen,but other than that 12 Years a Slave is really a work of art that I would recommend to all moviegoers. <br/><br/>Follows the twelve years of slavery Solomon Northup was put through after being abducted by white men. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Chiwetel Ejiofor Worst Performance: Scoot McNairy"

","It's the curse of almost any American movie about race relations to instantly become a political football. I usually ignore the outrage, because in general, these are message movies exploiting furor to distract from dearth of artistry—but 12 Years a Slave is a startling exception.<br/><br/>Indeed, my overall impression was one of restraint, with many long shots, silent but for the sounds of crickets.<br/><br/>And it's a true story.<br/><br/>Solomon Northup was a free man, an immensely identifiable middle-class husband and father, played in this film by empathetic, self-possessed Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br/><br/>In 1841, Solomon is persuaded by a pair of circus-men to travel to Washington D.C., there displaying his talents on the violin. While there, he is kidnapped by the ""Reverse Underground Railroad,"" and shipped to Mississippi, where he is sold as a slave, twice, working on two plantations. The first of these is owned by an indecisive Baptist preacher, Henry Ford, and the second by a sadistic psychopath, Edwin Epps.<br/><br/>Like most of us, Solomon takes freedom for granted. He presents his name and status like a badge of freedom, and expects to be heard, because he has lived in a free society all his life. An early beating beneath the streets of D.C. is the first of many indignities which begin to strip away this innocence. He has no rights. He has no freedom of speech, freedom to learn, freedom to travel.<br/><br/>Seldom have I seen a better representation of what it really means to be a slave. It's far beyond the pettiness of snubs about skin-color, or ""offensive"" football team names. Coming into this state of being so swiftly, and from a position of such prosperity, is traumatizing. The closest modern-day equivalent is when an American, about the freest of all citizens on this earth, takes a wrong turn and ends up in North Korea. ""Oh, sorry, I'll just turn around, shall I?""<br/><br/>Solomon does not identify as a black man, but as a free man. The distinction is important. At the deepest level, it's made clear that this oppression is not a result of shallow prejudices (or evil confined to any one race), but of power gone mad, and God's law discarded in a struggle for survival. Late in the film, an abolitionist makes this startlingly clear, contrasting a larger vision of scripture with the twisted fragments used by slavers to justify their actions. <br/><br/>When men are not seen as souls, they become property. This desecration of person-hood has taken place all over the world, and has led to holocausts and genocide in many nations. What is specific to this story is its ability to tap into our cultural and physical history, taking advantage of sumptuous Mississippi locations captured in gorgeous cinematography, and glorious African music (contrasting with Hans Zimmer's Inception-warmed- over score). To my delight, the visuals were a highlight of the film.<br/><br/>It isn't a documentary on the entirety of slavery, nor does it pretend to be—it is almost completely a first-person experience. To that effect, it sometimes glosses history to provide mood. A slave is stabbed, when he actually died of smallpox. Henry Ford is far more ambiguous as a character than the decent, though ideologically confused, preacher that Northup painted. Both of these things go towards intensifying the all-encompassing feeling of an unfair system. Even good men like Ford are crushed in the gears of the massive machine of survival, forced to horrific actions. Human action or vengeance is utterly, utterly futile in the face of such institutionalized cruelty. <br/><br/>And grace goes the other way. While never going so far as sympathy, we are shown that slavery has a terrible effect on oppressors, just as it has on oppressed: ""no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in, and day out without shredding at his own self."" It's a rare film that lets me see myself in both the slave and master.<br/><br/>It does have its flaws, many of which I have mentioned. Once again, it is a very brutal film, and not for the faint of heart. Lupita Nyong'o (who I, somehow, have gotten all the way through this post and not mentioned) is phenomenal. It is an Important Film, but not in the Boring Info-Dump sense, but in the sense that I am glad I have seen it, because it has permanently affected how I view slavery. I have never seen a movie that makes me value freedom this much, or feel despair at this level.<br/><br/>Full review posted here: http://www.longview95.blogspot.com/2014/06/12-years-slave-movie- review.html"
"andyreynolds-1","9","0","2","7 October 2014"," Comedy??????
","Let me start by saying this is not the comedy I was expecting..no, I know it's not a comedy.<br/><br/>Several months ago my wife and I were going to the movies and had a choice of seeing this film or a light comedy. I opted for the comedy offering that ""I didn't feel like seeing black Americans being beaten for 2 hours"". Well the other night I guess I did feel like watching said beatings because we chose to watch this amazing film on DVD in the comfort of our home.<br/><br/>What an amazing, unrelenting story writer & director Steve McQueen created bringing to life the dozen years the unfortunate Solomon Northup experienced as a slave in the deep south of America. Beginning with his reasonably comfortable life with his family we follow Solomon to Washington then Louisiana after he is illegally sold into bondage and does his best to exist in a world where he has no more value than livestock.<br/><br/>The role of Northup (or Pratt, his slave name) was very ably portrayed by British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. His role could have easily boiled down to simple outrage and hate but Chiwetel's journey is one of survival and he learned very early on that if he was to ever return to his family he would have to swallow his pride, hide his ability to read & write and exist as just another ""dumb slave"". In fact that's quite the life lesson for everyone watching this film; when the morons are in charge you have to act dumber than them to survive.<br/><br/>If I have a complaint about the film its that all but one white person in the south is portrayed as a sadistic maniac. Surely they couldn't have all been this way? One owner, Ford played by another Englishman Benedict Cumberbatch appears decent but he still employs psychopaths who enjoy terrorising the innocent blacks in their care.<br/><br/>The worst of the white slave owners however is the truly despicable Edwin Epps played by Irishman Michael Fassbender. A man drunk in all senses of the term; drunk with alcohol constantly and drunk with his power over the poor human beings he owns as slaves. He tortures them mentally and physically only because he can. Pushing them to the point where death comes as a welcome relief for the departed and as a result to be envied by those left behind.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet taken the opportunity you should watch 12 Years a Slave. It's well written, beautifully directed and the performances are outstanding. with the only exception of one big name Hollywood star who appeared to be reading his lines from cue cards and offered very little emotion in what was a pivotal role. That being said, without said actors support the film wouldn't have been made and that would have been an endearing tragedy.<br/><br/>I rank this movie in the same category as Schindlers List in that it moved me to such a degree I'm not sure I can watch it again. Not because of the horror and depiction of man's inhumanity against his fellow man but because I don't want to dilute the power of this film."

","Arguably the most remarkable movie ever made on the freedom of human soul along with Schindler's List, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and The Shawshank Redemption. If this piece of cinema can not make one respect and value one's freedom more, only actual loss of freedom will. It is hard to watch and harder to ignore.It is unflinching and provocative. <br/><br/>Steve McQueen has surpassed his previous works by miles when it comes to the scope of the theme, story telling, making the audience part of his vision, detailing, replicating costumes, tenor, sensibilities of a period dating more than 150 years back. At times, when he has juxtaposed silence, motion, sound and beauty of nature with the actions of characters/situations in the movie, he reminds you of Terence Malick, just that the message here is equally beautiful yet less ambiguous and more purposeful.McQueen has not for once held himself back and as a result created some absolutely unforgettable scenes and it is impossible for the viewer to not get absorbed by those. <br/><br/>​The casting couldn't have been better. McQueen sticks with Michael Fassbender for the powerhouse character of the movie, the ruthless slave owner. Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt are all cast almost perfectly. And with the superlative performance that Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor has delivered, there is no doubt that we have 3 top contenders for the Oscars with Matthew McConaughey and Leonardo DiCaprio filling the other two spots. It would be completely unfair to not mention the young actor, Lupita Nyong'o for playing probably the most difficult role in the movie. <br/><br/>​The background score is minimalistic but even with limited scope only Hans Zimmer could have communicated the emotions of the scenes as powerfully as they have been depicted through the visual medium.This one is a must for everyone to have in their personal library because you will surely want to watch it again"

"rayrodgpa","8","0","2","20 September 2014"," Slavery's Schindler's List, and deserving of all the appreciation and praise.
","From Steve McQueen, director of one-word, underrated masterpieces such as Hunger and Shame, comes this slavery epic starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender. The film follows Solomon Northup, a free man living with his family in New York, after he is tricked, kidnapped, and then sold into slavery. For 12 years he was degraded and tortured- both physically and mentally. His terrifying journey begins with working for Master Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a kind slave owner; as kind as a slave holder can be. Solomon's journey then leads to him to owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), a crazed, overly-religious, cruel owner. Solomon must muster up all the strength he has and never give up hope, for if he surrenders and accepts the position he is in, even if he survives he will never live. Back in 1993, Steven Spielberg directed the cinematic masterpiece Schindler's List. The incredible film took an unflinching look at the Holocaust and the sheer brutality of the Nazis. The film took home 7 Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Film of the Year. Since then, many movies have taken a realistic, terrifying look at the Holocaust; for instance, The Boy with the Stripped Pajamas and Inglourious Bastards. However, no Holocaust film has lived up to the unwavering storytelling of Schindler's List. 12 Years a Slave is not about the Holocaust, but it's aggressive look at slavery is just as awe-inspiring. I have been somewhat of a fan of director Steven McQueen for a while now, even since I experienced Hunger. His directing is unlike anything I've ever seen, the stillness and steadiness of some of his movies is hauntingly beautiful. The best thing about McQueen is that he can really get amazing, realistic performances from his actors. From the extremely underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor, to a cameo performance from Brad Pitt, the ensemble in this film was phenomenal. Everyone had an important part to play and everyone did an outstanding job, particularly Ejiofor. Before watching this movie, I had quite the conundrum when it came to who should win best actor. Tom Hanks did an amazing job as Captain Phillips in Captain Phillips, it looked like Matthew Mcaughnahy is continuing his incredible career improvement in Dallas Buyer's Club, and I'm one of those people who thinks it's absolutely ridiculous that Leonardo DiCaprio hasn't won an Academy Award yet, so I was hoping for the best with The Wolf of Wall Street. I had no idea who should win, now I do. Chiwetel's performance as Solomon Northup was undoubtedly the best this whole year. He is incredibly powerful and sympathetic, and he makes you hope and pray the character will survive this horrific ordeal. The amount of fear and turmoil he can convey with just a single look is mesmerizing. And I highly doubt he is the only actor who will bring home the golden statue for this movie. Michael Fassbender, playing the ruthless Edwin Epps, also delivers one of the best performances this year. He's a villain who lacks any sort of redemption, much like Ralph Fienne's performance in Schindler's List. His purpose in the movie is for the audience to hate and despise him, and it's safe to say they achieved their objective. Then there is novice actress Lupita Nyong'o, playing Patesy, a slave on the Epps plantation that Edwin has an attraction towards. Her performance, even though she only shows up half way through the movie, is one of the most memorable. Every single actor did an astonishing job, and they all deserve to be recognized for it. Then we get to the writing, one of the most crucial parts of any motion picture. At first, when I heard that the screenwriter was going to be the same writer of Red Tails and Undercover Brother, I was terrified. Both films were terribly written and it would be unfortunate for a movie with this amount of potential to fall apart due to an inconsistent script. Luckily, the writing was superb as well. The characters were well fleshed out and the pacing was hauntingly realistic. Solomon Northup's true story is an incredible one full of courage and strength, it's nice to see the film adaptation does it justice. Overall, 12 Years A Slave is the quintessential slavery epic. Thanks to Steve McQueen's harrowing, realistic direction, the lead actor's powerful and heart wrenching performance, 12 Years A Slave is, without a doubt, the most incredible film of 2013, and one of the best ever made. It's fair to say it more than deserves such a prestigious title."

","This film deservedly won several Oscars. It is beautifully shot, daring, intense and poignant to boot. It's inspired by a real person and a real event, so that makes it have even more of an impact. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a free African American black man, Solomon Northup, who gets sold to slavery, by a couple of scheming opportunist. It's about how he survives. He often has to compromise his ethics and morals and do some pretty crazy and brave things to get through it all. Some of the scenes are just heart breaking. Some people walked out on it when we saw it at the theater. I don't think they thought it was a bad movie per-say. I think they just couldn't take it anymore. I mean, I don't think I'm giving anything away, since it's about slavery, but there are whipping scenes in it that are disturbing. The acting by everyone from Brad Putt to Lupita Nyong'o and especially Michael Fassbender are just superb. Steve McQueen, as I said has an interesting style to get a point across. There's one scene that is an uncomfortably extended single camera shot for, what would be to long if any other director tackled it, but he plays it off perfectly and it really hits home. I would definitely recommend this one, but prepare yourself, it ain't pretty."

She had one big seen about her soap and that wins awards. I though the main guy, Solomon was really good and if any one should have won awards for acting it should have been him.

","I went into 12 Years A Slave with a lot of reluctance after immensely disliking director Steve McQueen's previous two films, especially Shame which I found reached hysterical heights of such inane drama that I shuttered at the thought of him tackling this subject matter. From the opening until the very last shot, McQueen has a masterful command of his craft and his film doesn't have a false note - he made a great picture. Chiwetel Ejiofor does fine work as an educated man from New York who gets kidnapped and sent down south to be sold into slavery. What he endures over the next 12 years is a degrading nightmare that makes your blood boil at such wretched humanity. Fassbender is a particular standout amongst a strong cast, as a grotesque slave owner who brings many layers to this villainous role that easily could have fallen into a one note archetype in a lesser actor's hands. Pitt shows up in a small role that doesn't require much from him and in what could have been a throwaway day player role, Giamatte makes the most of his slimy character. McQueen never over sells the drama and while scenes show humanity at its worst and most cruel, the film is surprisingly not grueling to sit through. One of the best films of 2013 for sure."

","(92%) Any movie that makes me feel angry at my own race is doing something right. Without a doubt this is a film everyone should watch, and I can only guess why this story is not as well known as it should be (hopefully thanks to this movie it now will be) is purely down to white guilt. The direction here is sublimely good throughout, the writing is perfect and never manipulative or forced, the characters believable and Ejiofor couldn't be any better in the lead role. It's not an easy watch at times, just as it should be, but it's so worthy of a look as an overall finely-made and important piece of cinema. And as such this comes highly recommended."
"jmillerdp","9","0","1","6 September 2014"," Brutal, But Beautifully Made
","Excellent, brutal, very well made film about the horrors of slavery. To me, this film has parallels with Spielberg's ""Schindler's List,"" that film depicting the horrors of The Holocaust, this film depicting the horrors of slavery.<br/><br/>But, Spielberg basically just hammers away at the audience for three hours to pound the horror into their heads. The only character we get to know is a Nazi, Oscar Schindler. The Jews are just there to be lined up for the slaughter. That movie is more blunt object than film. It is fairly inartful, and shows little of Spielberg's former talents as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>But, here, Steve McQueen offers a dramatic, dynamic film that enthralls the audience. It is brutal, yes. But, it is about the central character, Solomon Northrup, who is a free black, abducted and sold into slavery.<br/><br/>We truly get to know him and those others who have been enslaved. They aren't just unknown victims.<br/><br/>The artistic qualities are masterful, especially Sean Bobbitt's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's film score. The performances are very good all around, and show how McQueen and his cast were able to create an excellent working relationship.<br/><br/>It is a tough film to watch, but I believe it is a film that should be seen.<br/><br/>********* (9 Out of 10 Stars)"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","1","31 August 2014"," An outstanding adaptation
","This book has just been adapted into a film. In fact it is the second time. . .<br/><br/>There could be a third side to the question reflecting a change among the Blacks themselves. Since the beginning of this century the Blacks influenced by the mostly Christian NAACP and those influenced by the Nation of Islam have developed an approach of their heritage as Post Traumatic Stress. They have two names for this. The First group calls it Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome and they are essentially centered on the concept of reparations, hence a collective approach, neglecting the psychological individual problem and hence admitting more or less, like Booker T. Washington, that they have no knowledge of their ancestry. The second group calls it Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder and they are centering their approach on an individual procedure within group processing to help each individual and his group to understand and step out of the problem by re-assessing and revalorizing their past generations and their heritage going as far as possible within slavery itself.<br/><br/>The recent adaptation of the book (first published in 1853) is outstanding in spite of the fact that it cuts a lot of stuff from it. It shortens the legal battle at the end for example but it gives a clear vision of what the Trauma of slavery was and how the Blacks managed to go through it. Never did they really drop their belief that surviving was not worth suffering for. The film gives some fundamental elements that enabled the Black to survive under the worst possible duress and violence. First of all the very planters and slave owners for reasons that have not yet been explained on the Anglo-Saxon side of slavery actually preached their slaves the Bible and Christianity. In the film one planter uses it to elevate their morals and ethical vision, and another uses it to justify his violence against them. But in a way or another they transmitted to them, more nilly than willy, willy-nilly anyway a religious vision that claimed hope and that eternal life was won by suffering in this world. The slaves turned this belief around into a clandestine and underground call for rebellion (openly stated in the next world) in the name of freedom doubled with a tremendous patience in front of the real situation that was a sign of some complicity with God himself. One song, in front of the grave of an old slave, is just that double message. Booker T. Washington explains in his autobiography Up From Slavery:<br/><br/>""Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom. True, they had sung those same verses before (emancipation and the end of the Civil War), but they had been careful to explain that the ""freedom"" in these songs referred to the next world, and had no connection with this life in the world. Now (after the full emancipation after the Civil War) they gradually threw off the mask, and were not afraid to let it be known that the ""freedom"" in their songs meant freedom of the body in this world."" (p. 21-22)<br/><br/>The other elements that enabled the slaves to keep their sanity for one and their dignity in their survival for two is the direct negation of what Willie Lynch had said: deprive them of their language, deprive them of their culture, deprive them of their religion. He thought that by doing that he would be able to negate their humanity. The Slaves just had to learn another language (the interest of their own masters), English, French or Spanish, and then this new language enabled them to retain and develop their mental power and intelligence. They replaced their old religions with Christianity though they often invested in this Christianity some old beliefs and myths producing Voodoo, for example and other local Africanized version of Christianity. They retained their rhythmic culture and nature and they transformed any task performed on the plantation under duress and violent overseeing into a singing class, a rhythmic experience, a unique cultural survival (enabling them to keep the rhythm of the work, hence satisfying the interest of the planter and escaping whipping in the evening). Actually it is this cultural survival that has produced the music of the Blacks in America and that music has become the polyrhythmic music of the world today. It is a shame the film does not five a full experience of a ""Christmas vacation"" all planters provided their slaves with. That was one of these moments (present in the book) when the Black slaves were mostly reviving and re-energizing their own African heritage, even five or ten generations after the Middle Passage. <br/><br/>The film shows that mental survival, at the cost of psychological trauma, and we can thus understand that even when a slave wanted to die in order to escape his or her suffering, the survival instinct, multiplied by their own survival experience, will be stronger and will take over and enable him or her to go on one more step or two. The main character, Solomon Northup, is the acme of that survival attitude in how he manages to never forget who he was and still is, in spite of his having to hide his real nature and identity behind the imposed name and identity of Platt.<br/><br/>After the lethal selection of the Middle Passage, the Africans who had survived crossing the Atlantic had managed to develop this survival stance that will enable them to enrich our world today with one of the greatest African heritage we all share in music. . . <br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Only once in a decade do you feel that a film has truly opened its soul to you; we have had the likes of Apocalypse Now in the 70's and its brutal honesty about the destructive power of war. Shindlers List in the 90's and its personification of mans remarkable ability to change and self sacrifice. Now in the 2010's we have 12 Years a Slave, which I consider to be a Pandora Box story at its centre, showing that hope can often be the only thing left strong enough to guide you through some of the most unspeakable cruelties. <br/><br/>Director Steve McQueen's 12 Years of a Slave is a historical drama based on real life accounts of Solomon Northup, a Free African American family man with a beautiful musical gift (Chitwetel Ejiofor) who in 1841 who was wrongly sold into slavery for 12 years. During that long struggle, his every turn was fraught with pain of being kept away from his family and the pain of watching his fellow people subjugated to stomach turning horror. But unlike on TV, when the horror gets too scary and real, you can't change channels. During those years of being sold and moved, he encounters a wide spectrum of different people and masters; on one side he comes under the ownership of Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) one the very few slave masters who seem to have some semblances of a moral compass as he tries in vain to keep a family together instead of allowing them to be sold separately. Then later on we have a cameo from Brad Pitt playing Samuel Bass, a builder who seems to be the only white person in the film who voices adamant objections to the treatment of the slaves. While on the offer more sinister side there is Tibeats Paul Dano a man who is clearly threatened by the far more intelligent Solomon who is fast becoming a favourite of Ford, which causes Tibeat to seek to humiliate Solomon and punish him at his every whim. But the real villain is Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) who starts off as the most ambiguous of the other slave masters encountered. In the beginning he seems passive and submissive to his wife, but as the film progresses he grows more and more deranged and insane fueled by his predilection bordering on obsession with Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), a cotton picking slave girl. This truth infuriates his wife (Sarah Paulson), causing tension between the two of them, especially when the wife is faced with the crushing blow that she will always play second fiddle to Patsey. Just to play devils advocate, from four amazing actors who brought you Tyler Durden, Eli Sunday, Magneto and Sherlock, one of my few criticisms on 12 Year of Slave is that I would have wanted to see a little more of these fine actors and the characters I felt remained largely unexplored in the film. On a film diet consisting of emotional drenched Marlon Brando ramblings and big resounding Al Pacino speeches, initially it perplexed me how Nyong'o's and Ejiofor 's more subtle and less extravagant performances were able to garner a Oscar win and nomination. However upon reflection I realized that the performances were perfectly suitable to express both characters systematic beating down, the time and era and the emotional stress each was under throughout. And because Nyong'o and Ejiofor were able to evoke and encompass such difficult hardship in natural understated manners, it showed their deep understandings of the text as a whole and the unique turmoil of each character. <br/><br/>In terms of an overall response to 12 Years of a Slave; I initially didn't know much about this subject because back in school I always felt that the slave trade was a segment of history that was always underexplored. But this film sought to correct that, as it offered a great educational experience teaching me a lot about the plight and hardship unfairly thrust on to these innocent people.12 Years also reminded me again that cinema has the ability to transcend from shackles of just being about entertainment and the spectacle, when in fact it can be so much more than that. It can be a way to hold to our society a mirror reflecting only unflinching sincerity exposing the truth of humanity, from our compassionate nature too our darkest and sinister capacity for evil. While at other times a single film can teach you a lot more than an entire library of textbooks, because while a good book asks you to engage your mind, a great film asks you to engage your entire being and soul . Another thing about 12 Years that I enjoyed was Patricia Norris's good enough to put Downton Abbey to shame costume design certainly which caught my eye. At times it was like watching a beautiful 1900's painting of the bourgeoisie coming to life. 12 Years of Slave remain on the fine light between the arguments of; is it is important to constantly remind ourselves of the past so to ensure that it never happens again? Or does such reflection only ensure that the past is repeated because by continuing to look at the despicable atrocity of the history, you only succeed in adding more timbre to the blaze of hostility and breed more mistrust. But my stance on the subject is rather cleaner cut; by ignoring of the past is denying the essences of these good people the solace of allowing their suffering to act as a reminder to all future generations of how not to treat people, because whilst the slaves lost their bodies to the slave trade, the masters and owners lost more in the way of their souls and humanity."

","actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance."

","I watch the movie after hearing all the Oscar buzz and well, it won the best picture eventually. Most reviewer will consider this movie is the best one of 2013/2014 but as for me, it lacks something. Everything is there, the cast, the plot, the setting, the (controversial) theme. However, it needs something that you can remember even after 10 years watching it. There's nothing to converse, but it's perfect. Maybe that's the problem, it's too perfect. It's like having the best chocolate cake (forgive the pun) , but what you crave is probably a cheesecake or apple pie. You will say it's the best one but it's maybe not what you enjoy the most. <br/><br/>But if i have to applaud, it's definitely the cast. They are very memorable in their own different way. Michael Fassbender did a fantastic job in it. He is my definitely new one-to-watch after the movie and as for 2014/2015, you will see a lot more from him. Overall, the movie is flawless but you probably need to sleep after you finish it."
"MacTheMovieguy","10","0","1","23 July 2014"," ""A near flawless effort that is definitely one of the best movies of the year""
","I'm sure you've heard a lot about 12 Years A Slave this year. It's the predestined winner of the Oscar, and apparently ""ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE"" if you've seen the TV ads. But, is it? Really? The problem with overhyping a film is that sometimes you raise the bar so high that the audience never reaches it. The interesting thing about 12 Years A Slave is that it is a near flawless effort that is definitely one of the best movies of the year. You can scroll down later and see that I'm giving it an A, or you can read why.<br/><br/>12 Years A Slave is adapted from the book of the same name about the true story of Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the deep south. This movie is as much about him as it is the people he meets along the way. There's a mother (Adepero Oduye) who is sold separately from her children. There's the first slave owner (Cumberbatch), who isn't bad when put in perspective, and gives Solomon some decent treatment. The second one, Edwin Epps (Fassbender) is a monster who lusts after one of his slaves, Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o). This causes Edwin's wife (Sarah Paulson) to treat her horribly.<br/><br/>You will see things in the film that will move you. It is an incredibly hard movie to watch. There are hangings, and lynchings, and they are quite extended and director Steve McQueen makes you feel every moment of them. For me, the film doesn't succeed as much because of the directing of McQueen, or because of the script, but because Chiwetel Ejiofor is literally groundbreaking here. I have yet to see some of the other great performances this year (Redford, McConaughey), but I can't imagine Ejiofor not winning the Oscar. He's a revelation, and he's the main reason to watch the film.<br/><br/>The second reason would be the game changing performance by Michael Fassbender. Fassbender has turned in a few noteworthy performances in the past (just missing out on an Oscar nod for Shame), but he can't be ignored here. Anyone who sees this film will vote for Fassbender. His slave owner is everything it needed to be. He's angry, he's insane, and he's the perfect counterpoint for Solomon Northrup. He is evil that hides behind the word of the bible. There's a lynching scene in the film that Fassbender just dominates.<br/><br/>The third reason would be the breakthrough performance from Lupita Nyong'o. Her character calmly enters the film, and works her way into your heart. You break for her. You ache for her. What was so interesting is how when we first see her character on the screen, you don't sense that anything major will come from her character. You think that she's just another face in Solomon's story, but Lupita crafts such a beautiful arc that when she comes to Solomon and begs him to take her life, you want him to. Her struggle is so well defined by the end of the film, topped off by a heartbreaking moment at the end of the film. Solomon can't save her. No one can.<br/><br/>The movie isn't profound because of the directing or the storytelling, but because a handful of actors are bright shining lights. While I am giving this film an A, it is not my #1 film of the year. I know, that's shocking. I can't imagine ever being able to watch this film again, because it is a really difficult film to watch. But, I am grateful that I saw it. I saw the great performances on screen, and experienced everything Solomon's story had to offer. Will it win Best Picture? Probably. Is it? Well, it's in my Top 5. I guess you can say, I'm still rooting for Gravity."

"brando647","9","0","1","19 July 2014"," An Exceptional Film; the Best of 2013
","I can't remember the last time I've watched a movie as powerful as Steve McQueen's 12 YEARS A SLAVE. It's an epic film bringing to life the horrors of American slavery in the nineteenth century. We learn about the atrocities in school but it doesn't quite deliver the message as well as witnessing them with our own eyes. The plight of early African Americans has been covered in countless other films but McQueen's film has a level of authenticity I don't know that I've seen before. It's a period piece that spared no expense in bringing the plantation-era South to life and it's filled to the brim with brilliant cast. It's based on the true story of Solomon Northup (portrayed in the film by Chiwetel Ejiofor) though, as is the case with any true-life film stories, I couldn't tell you how accurate the events might be. Solomon was born a free man in the North and was living a successful life with his wife and children in New York when he was kidnapped and smuggled to New Orleans to be sold as a slave. Over the course of the next twelve years, Solomon would experience horrors no man should endure and fight to maintain his humanity when treated as nothing more than personal property. He starts on a plantation with the kind-hearted Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) but circumstances force him into the employ of the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Epps and his wife are evil incarnate with total disregard for the lives of their slaves, frequently utilizing humiliation and brutal punishment to crush their spirits. With hopes of reunification with his family in the North, Solomon must scheme to regain his freedom while remaining under the nose of his violent, alcoholic owner.<br/><br/>The production value in this film is phenomenal. I seriously hope the production team won a bundle of awards for their work on this film. Everything feels so authentic, from the costumes to the set design. And the cinematography of Sean Bobbitt is absolutely gorgeous, giving an element of beauty to a world filled with pain and suffering. I can't believe this movie was made for a mere $20 million. There are movies that cost four times as much and don't look half as good as this one. There was a tremendous amount of respect infused into the creation of 12 YEARS A SLAVE and it shines through. Respect is probably the most important trait a filmmaker needs when covering a subject as delicate as slavery in the United States. Remember, relatively speaking, it hasn't been that long since slavery was abolished in America and the ripples of the severe mistreatment of African Americans continues to affect our society even now. You don't want to overindulge in the wrong aspects of the subject matter for fear of becoming an exploitation film (unless you're Quentin Tarantino and you're directing DJANGO UNCHAINED, but that man's a master of revenge exploitation films). If you aim to break the audiences' hearts with tales of real-life cruelty, I imagine it's a fine balance of presenting the brutal violence and juxtaposing it with the unwavering strength of the protagonist in the face of it all without going overboard on one of the other out of fear that the film might a) exploit the suffering of others or b) preach a message as opposed to giving the audience an emotional experience.<br/><br/>I can't imagine the nerve it requires to accept a role in a film such as this one. There are no good roles here, but they're all fantastic performances. No one wants to be the whip-cracking slave owner or the poor soul on the receiving end. I'm sure there was nothing easy about of it and the experience of creating this film will probably remain with its cast for a good long time. Everyone was exceptional here. Chitewel Ejiofor gave the performance of his lifetime with the role of Solomon Northup. Solomon is a strong soul and, while he wavers at times, he never loses hope that he might some day return to his normal life. He witnesses the most horrific acts of violence against his fellow slaves, and falls victim a few times himself, and he does so each time knowing that he's helpless to stop it. I agree that Matthew McConaughey did a fantastic job in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB but Ejiofor was robbed of the Academy Award for this film. The man deserved it. Recognition was given to Lupita Nyong'o for her supporting role as Patsey, Epp's prized possession. Ejiofor had it rough as Solomon but no one had it as bad as Nyong'o. Her character is the most tragic in the film. Patsey is the object of Epp's desires (to the resentment of his wife) and he's also the target for the most horrific abuse as a result. She's a broken woman and you know once the credits roll that her character would not have a happy ending. Michael Fassbender gives another standout performance as Epps and you nearly don't recognize him. It was hard to imagine Fassbender in such a hate-fueled performance but, man, he delivers. He's scary good.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is populated with exceptional talent. Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Alfre Woodard, Brad Pitt, and more fill out the expansive cast and everyone delivers their A-game. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is an exceptional film and the best of the year. It's engaging and powerful and sure to have an effect on even the hardest of hearts. Considering the subject matter, you should know to be mindful that this film can be painful to watch but it's an easy recommendation from me."

Not having read any reviews for 12 Years A Slave, I only knew it was fearlessly honest about the story of a free man from the North, kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana.<br/><br/>Such clear purpose and vision could only produce a story of unwavering fortitude such as this. Steve McQueen, the director, is an artist and true visionary for his unflinching portrayal of Mr. Solomon Northup's story and the unending brutalities and injustices encountered by those in slavery. The knot that persisted in my stomach from start to finish is a direct result of his firm ability to never look away. I felt compelled to honor those who had endured such unspeakable horrors that were once their life by watching and also not looking away, likely Mr. McQueen's goal. <br/><br/>From the moment Mr. Northup is sold, as Platt, you hopelessly seek out for some person to be a refuge as he fights to survive. The story is beautifully told, never allowing you to fully become immersed in the slave's life, never truly forgetting the freedom that was once had – with the use of flashbacks and remarks reminiscent of a previous life. <br/><br/>No scene is wasted, no filler, no false emotions spurred from music, just the hard truth of one man's life. The saddest truth is Mr. Northup's story is unremarkable in comparison to thousands of other men, women and children forced and born into slavery.<br/><br/>Every actor deserves not just a nomination, but an award, to honor their brave and ultimately successful choice to take on such an insurmountable task of each role. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye and the countless actors who I failed to list or those who played minor roles were impeccable and steadfast and a direct contributor to the movie's achievement.<br/><br/>If you are emotionally mature enough to endure such a dramatic, honest and truthful story then I implore you to set apart a day and watch 12 Years A Slave. A day is necessary to allow yourself to process such a magnificent film that is truly in a class of its own surpassing all other films released this year.<br/><br/>I do understand if you do not, as the movie was incredibly difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Find all our reviews at our website!"

","When I mentioned 12 Years a Slave to my Dad, he said, ""I hear that's great but depressing.""<br/><br/>An apt analysis, some may agree. But I would de-emphasize the depression aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>There are quite a few more tears than I am used to relinquishing, however, the majority are triggered by the happiness of the ending.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it's desensitization or a function of my age, but I would not describe the material as specifically ""depressing.""<br/><br/>Horrifying? Sure.<br/><br/>Moving? Riveting? Absolutely.<br/><br/>But I don't believe it induces a sad darkness that hitchhikes upon your brain for a number of days. We're all aware slavery happened, right?<br/><br/>I do not mean this to be critical towards the specificity of my father's diction. It's more to discourage a certain mindset.<br/><br/>If you want to see a great movie, no matter how often you see them, 12 Years a Slave is easily worth the two hours and fourteen minutes. It's shot remarkably well, edited masterfully, and retells the true story of the novel by Solomon Northup.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor is spectacular in this role. Perhaps it's the lack of theatricality in his performance, but it's just stunning. It's the perfect mix of reserved and outspoken.<br/><br/>Towards the beginning, when the man breaks two separate paddles over his back, how does he prepare for that sort of acting? Seriously, it baffles me. I'm so thoroughly convinced by Chiwetel's performance that I'm more focused on what the other actor is actually breaking the paddles over.<br/><br/>(I shouldn't think like that during first viewings, but can't help myself sometimes.)<br/><br/>According to IMDb, Chiwy learned to play the violin for this role! Could he be any more of a boss?<br/><br/>When he starts to sing with the other cotton-picking slaves is a wonderful transformative moment. But the whole movie is great; each scene is so beautiful and the conflicts running beneath are palpable.<br/><br/>You can feel the very value of his life diminishing as a product; a piece of human property. The film explores the themes of slavery so efficiently; that I wonder how much of the material actually came from the book.<br/><br/>The thing is, either way, the film takes place over the course of twelve years. I'm certain all of these things could have happened to him throughout that period. It seems like there are mostly only cruel white men in this world. Or at least, only slightly sympathetic Caucasians.<br/><br/>Which, as a side note, is perhaps the only loose thread in the screenplay's quilt. Perhaps the only white slave depicted in the film shouldn't be the one to betray Chiwetel to Fassbender. But that's semantics, because it only further reinforces his apprehension when Brad Pitt rolls around.<br/><br/>So the weakness of that criticism is illustrative of any others I might have with this film – mild and without any real footing.<br/><br/>Like Eliza's crying. It went on a touch too long, but perhaps that's exemplary of the lifestyle Solomon had to endure. Perhaps there were times the crying went on much longer for him.<br/><br/>So overall, I give 12 Years a Slave two big thumbs up. It's #4 on my 'Best Films of 2013' list.<br/><br/>It's a visual masterpiece and tells an exhilarating narrative"

","This is amazing. McQueen did an amazing job in the masterpiece. The hanging scenes were very graphic. This movie does include nudity so that is a warning for parents watching this with their kids. However, there's a reason this is Rated R. There is very frequent use of ""nigger"" and a few uses of ""negro"" but that is common in movies about black rights and slavery. <br/><br/>Now about the movie: The movie is a very amazing work of art. You can tell there's great detail in the skill put into this film. Amazing acting, and Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>What I found annoying about this movie is Brad Pitt playing the ""hero"" of this movie. Brad Pitt plays a man who frees the slave from the plantation which isn't surprising since it's Brad Pitt. He goes around the world for protesting human rights. So once you saw him talking to the slaves you knew he'd have something to do with freeing them. That is kind of a spoiler when you're watching the movie!<br/><br/>I rate it 10/10. Ignoring Brad Pitt, he still did an excellent job. It is graphic but that's why we love these movies. It make you hate your own race (if you're white) for doing such an evil thing to people. They do bring up biblical points which is not to be taken against religion at all. <br/><br/>To sum is all up, great job! 10 stars!"

"TxMike","Null","0","2","12 June 2014"," Based on a true story of a man wrongly enslaved for 12 years.
","It was 1841 and black slavery was still going strong in the USA, particularly in the South. Much of the story here is set in Southern Louisiana and was actually filmed there, including in New Orleans proper. A street was even blocked off and dirt brought in to simulate an old upstate New York town in one scene. Several of the old plantation homes in surrounding areas were used for filming.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor, who received an Oscar nomination for his role, is Solomon Northup, a free black man with a wife and two small children in upstate New York. He plays violin and during one period when his wife was gone away for a few weeks to work as a cook, he is befriended by two men who say they are with a traveling troupe, a circus of sorts, and Solomon can make good money with his violin playing. He goes with them and, after a night of too much drinking, awakes to find himself shackled. <br/><br/>He had been kidnapped and then put on a boat down to New Orleans. He ended up having to work as a slave, and also to conceal his true identity, for black men who could read and write were a threat and would likely be hanged to their death.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story of the real Solomon Northup who was forced into illegal slavery for 12 years. It is a good story, it shows probably very accurately what slavery was like. I do have objections, many scenes move very slowly, and scenes of beatings or near hangings dwell on the horror of it a bit too long. We know it was evil and wrong, we don't need to see so much graphic gore.<br/><br/>But overall it is a well-told story, and of course it won the Oscar for best picture. To me the best actor here was Brit Michael Fassbender as the cruel slave owner.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: After 12 years Solomon was working on a project when he came across an abolitionist from Canada (Brad Pitt), and told him his story, asking him to contact people he knew in New York. Later someone came for him with law enforcement, Solomon was able to return to his home and family in New York. Historically, it isn't totally clear what his fate was after that."

"cleary-joshua","9","0","1","5 June 2014"," This is one of the most difficult films I've had to watch, but is filled with phenomenal performances...
","Some films have subject matters which are tricky to watch but important to know about. ""Schindler's List"" is by no means a film that you come out of and think ""I really loved that"", but it gets its message across effectively and is emotionally rewarding. In that film particularly, realism is key, and Spielberg doesn't hold back in images of brutality. ""12 Years a Slave"" is even more horrific at times and one of the most difficult films I've had to watch in a while, but it conveys important messages about racism and slavery, and thanks to its phenomenal performances, makes you relate so much to its characters.<br/><br/>The film follows Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free man who is kidnapped and taken into slavery. He fights for years to prove his innocence, while working under numerous cruel masters, including those played by Paul Dano and Michael Fassbender. One of the film's successes is in not creating a clear divide between black and white, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt both playing characters who support and are kind to Solomon. But under Fassbender's character, Edwin Epps, he is beaten often, as is Patsey, played by Lupita Nyong'o.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are all brilliant, especially those of Ejiofor and Nyong'o, who convey pain and suffering like I have never seen before on screen. They are both convincing and don't overstate it, which is what makes the characters so successful. You feel every minute of Solomon's journey, and he makes you root for him so much. The film's brutality is one of its most important parts, and occasionally you have to look away due to the sheer extremity of it all, but the fact that nothing is held back adds a sense of reality to it. The scars on Patsey's back after she has been lashed repeatedly are horrible to see, but send such an important message.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen shoots the film in a very artistic way, with lots of lingering shots on the beauty of the New Orleans country side. However he knows where to focus his camera during the more painful scenes to make them even stronger. A single extended shot, which runs for probably 2 minutes but feels like ages, shows Solomon tiptoeing around in some mud while hung up by his neck. The camera does not move, and you just hear the sounds of his throat clicking as he gasps for breath. It's difficult to witness, and goes on just a bit too long, but again this cruelty is important to the story, because it makes the audience think. It also makes the ending, which is filled with so much emotion, a whole lot more rewarding because we have seen and can understand everything that these characters have been through.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" is an utterly unique movie. It has moments which are so difficult to watch, and perhaps it is important for audiences to know what they're getting in for before they watch this, but the stunning performances and breathtaking cinematography help to make it a rewarding and thought provoking experience."

","This movie is very encouraging and inspirational. Solomon is an American citizen with freedom and has a happy family. But one day they took away his freedom and he became a slave and he experienced two masters. One of the masters was very terrible and treat slave as property if they did not achieve the target, he whipped them. It's the most infuriating part in the plot. Solomon has never forgotten that he is a free man. One of plot lines was that Patsey was physically abused. She made a request that Solomon and her life. She does not have any other hope in her eyes. Solomon does not agree to it. Her ideas and Solomon's are not the same, he say "" I am not just surviving, I want myself a life; I will not fall into despair; I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune."" I feel very animate by this plot. Last, Solomon meets Bass who advocates freedom. Solomon begs him to write his friends and acquaint them with his situation. His friends take free papers and he gets the freedom. We can the actor who is very calm and patient and he is temporarily down but wants himself a life. And we can see that he is very frustrated on his face. This is very deep in his heart. So this is why the film won 3 Oscars and I love for that reason."

","When looking back at America's disturbing past of holding slavery to be righteous, you become moved by films like this. '12 Years a Slave' is a strong story about Solomon Northup, a once violinist from New York turned slave in the south. The film shows how he went from kidnapped to sold to moved in a powerful and sickening way. Chiwetel Ejofer plays Solomon excellently, delivery strong emotions and fear. As the film progresses you get to observe just how hard being a slave truly is, and Chiwitel nails it. Every scene he is full of artistic talent that makes the audience moved into feeling for his character. Michael Fassbender gives the best performance as Edwin Epps, a brutal Louisiana slave master who owns Solomon Northup. The fear he gives to the audiences makes every scene he's in go still and chill. Fassbender's southern accent and yelling scenes along with brutality make his character come to life, and cause a sense of hatred towards his character. Lupita Nyong'o plays Patsy, a physically and emotionally abused slave who is the best at picking cotton. The horrendous things done to poor Patsy are sickening and show you how slaves were treated ion a very vivid and graphic manner. This is a film that should be shown in schools while learning about American history due to the superb historical relevance and accuracy. John Ridley's story is filled with detail that makes you see how slavery was like for the poor slaves. He adds excellent dialogue and chilling scenes that leave you speechless and moved. Steve Mcqueen's directing is outstanding as he captures spectacular footage about the hardships of slavery in the 1800's. The other film aspects such as costume and production design, editing, cinematography and score put together the powerful puzzle and bring you a strong film that will hit hard and hopefully make you feel lucky to be free."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>The true life tale of Solomon Northrup (Chweitel Ejiofor), a respectable black member of high society, who nonetheless finds himself thrust in to the world of slavery in 1841, America. The film follows his transfer from the more subdued slave-owner Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) to the more ferocious, unscrupulous Epps (Michael Fassbender), through to his eventual salvation when he is rescued by those who knew him.<br/><br/>Possibly one of the strongest contenders at the Oscars this year, Brit director Steve McQueen once again brings the historical shame that is slavery to the forefront with this adaptation of the titular character's account of his degeneration from a high position in the world, to his degradation as a servant to the whims of his various twisted masters. Such strong, emotionally driven material is a natural shue-in for the highest honours, and does indeed provide an enthralling production all the way. Rather than having a central protagonist from a poor, impoverished background, this is a shattering highlight of how even an esteemed, respectable black man from those times was prone to being rounded up and forced against his will to serve at his master's feet. If the premise of the story isn't harrowing enough, the film is visually, graphically unflinching also when it comes to depicting the vicious, scarring whippings and beatings the captives were given to keep them in order.<br/><br/>A strong, commanding central performance is a must here, and Ejiofor more than fails to disappoint, in what will probably be one of, if not the most, high profile leading role of his career, with current Brit super talents Cumberbatch and Fassbender in respective roles as Solomon's owners, along with a colourful supporting cast that includes Paul Dano, Brad Pitt and Paul Giamatti in roles that don't get the most screen time, but make no less impact. It's a testament to the human spirit that it's a true life story that has that rarest of real life things, a happy ending, unneeded for a manufactured one to be dreamed up by Hollywood that would probably have produced less of an emotional pay off.<br/><br/>This is still powerful, dynamic film making, charged along with strong performances and a stirring emotional theme. *****"

May Allah bless those souls that have suffered such an horrible horrible fate. Over thousands of years mankind has not yet learned that we have been created equal. Even today slavery torment exists whether it is the diamond mines in Africa, a man on minimum wage who has to sustain his family, or a professional white collar worker in the wall-streets who is a slave to debt, greed and materialistic possession. Or a soldier in an army who goes to war believing he is doing this for the freedom of the people of this country. This movie should be watched by the whole world.

"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","1","19 May 2014"," At times this is a very tough film to watch, but it is a film that you really should watch
","There's no questioning the emotional impact that 12 years a slave had on me. It is quite simply an emotional punch to the stomach. The reason why I generally enjoy films that are based on true stories is that if done right they will either entertain me or move me (or sometimes both). 12 years a slave didn't entertain me (as the title of the film implies), but it was incredibly moving. This is largely down to the performances of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o who were both convincing in their respective roles - I really felt for them and found myself trying to empathise with how much they must have suffered, but I feel it's impossible to truly appreciate the appalling treatment that these slaves must have suffered back in the 1840's.<br/><br/>This brings me neatly on to my next point; I've noticed that some people have criticised this film for the degree of violence that has been portrayed - I'm confused the film is about black people that are sold into slavery and the slaves were badly treated so why would you not expect it to be violent? McQueen and co have not held back and yes there are quite a number of scenes that are tough to watch, but I believe that this was done to give the audience a true understanding of how awful these black slaves were treated. Some may argue that the violence should have been toned down, but I personally feel that this would have made it feel less realistic.<br/><br/>There were minor problems with this film; I felt that the narrative was a bit messy - characters were introduced and then disappeared without much development. I also struggled to understand who did what - overseers, masters, debtors. All these characters were introduced with very little explanation as to what they all did. I haven't read the book but I would wager money that all this was explained better in the book. I also felt for this reason that some of the characters weren't developed quite as well as I would have hoped.<br/><br/>Aside from Ejiofor and Nyong'o, we also get strong performances from Fassbender and Dano. Dano doesn't get much screen time, but makes good use of the time that he's given. I personally think he's an excellent actor. Fassbender's character is the personification of evil and really gets into his character - another brilliant performance. Brad Pitt shows up towards the end, but Pitt merely goes through the motions (although in fairness he isn't called upon to do much else). Although he is only in the film for a short period of time his character proves to be very important to the plot - I won't spoil why though.<br/><br/>This is a great film that certainly isn't an easy film to watch. If you're the sort of person that gets upset by violent scenes then I'm not sure that this will be the film for you - which is a shame as it is very good. I myself am not keen on violence in films if it is violence just for the sake of violence - i.e it serves no purpose. In 12 years a slave the violence does serve a purpose and that's the big difference. The ending of the film is particularly moving and I suspect that it will leave quite a few people with teary eyes. A wonderful film that is essential viewing."

","This was a film with an extraordinary story to tell, that was as a central pivot around slavery well known, but the sub plot to that and how Solomon Northrop came to be a slave, was most definitely not as known in popular culture (until this film anyway!). <br/><br/>Whilst not always the easiest watch, Steve McQueen handled bringing that to the screen really rather well and probably should have got a lot more kudos himself than his film seems to have been getting. He didn't do in a judgmental way but let Solomon's story flow...and almost tell itself. There wasn't any condescending type scenes over burdened with script, rather a lot of 'we'll display it and let you judge for yourself' type ones (the hanging scene springs to mind) & the story depicted on screen was the richer for it. <br/><br/>Not being a filmmaker, I cannot go too in depth on the technicalities but it looked beautifully shot too...I have heard some bemoan his style of filming, but having seen a couple of his other films I was familiar with this and comfortable with... although it felt more expensive (if that's the right word) than his previous offerings... the film was still suitably confronting...which given the topic it was always going to be. That said it was depicted in a way where you weren't looking to take sides, even though it was obvious where your sympathies should lie...but was telling that it was apparent that the more tragic figures were the slave owners and those associated to it, rather than the victims themselves. From Paul Giamatti's boorish seller to Paul Dano's unsure underhand, & Benedict Cumerbatch's sympathetic plantation owner (all superbly played) - then of course there was Mcqueen's male muse, the always excellent Fassbender (can someone just go ahead & script a film where he & Daniel day Lewis are brothers or rivals or something!) portraying the most villainous yet clearly troubled and tragic figure...battling with his feelings for Patsy whilst trying to remain stoic to how things should be in that day and age. Thinking his superiority was real when it was clearly betrayed by his mind and no more than a virtue of timing and geography...(the latter points much like Solomon's misfortune that gave the known yet unknown sub-plot of the wider theme of slavery it's arc). <br/><br/>The film reached its peaks around scenes involving Mr Fassbender and the incredible Lupita (fully deserving of her accolades since) but the films constant and bedrock was clearly Chiwetel Ejifor...he portrayed Solomon's anguish admirably and really captured that sense of 'why has this happened to me' that allowed the viewers to transcend the more accepted tales of slavery that have perhaps been captured before. That in itself means the film will be revered for quite some time, 8/10"

","I have always said that the viewing of Schindler's List is necessary, it is perhaps the most realistic interpretation of the holocaust and educated me for one about the holocaust far more than any history class did. The point of saying this is because 12 years a slave is to slavery what Schindler's List was to the holocaust. It is necessary viewing and as far as I can tell from my relatively uneducated view point the most realistic interpretation of slavery ever put to celluloid. This is due to the incredible central performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor along with the fantastic supporting cast. Special mention to Michael Fassbender for producing in my opinion one of the most terrifying and brutal characters villains in a movie. The way the film is shot is also incredible, there are several very long takes with steady cams, and you are just watching thinking this is all the one shot. Perhaps the most brilliant thing about the film in my opinion is how the main character visibly loses hope, and this could be seen simply through his posture and the camera work. He starts the film with a straight back and is filmed with steady cams always with wide angle shots, however as the film goes on his shoulders slouch, and sequences of him are shot with hand-held cameras and are shot much closer to him, this portrays so well the intense situation that he has been put in and the complete loss of hope and acceptance of his life of slavery. This is an incredible film that everyone should watch, it is not easy a lot of the time and can be quite brutal, but this is absolutely necessary."

","During the first few minutes is an infuriatingly common editing choice: showing scenes that we reach later in the film. Putting these as the first scenes in the film, they are entirely out of context, and fail to elicit emotion. Playing in the background of these opening shots, the (otherwise magnificent) soundtrack sounds hammy and forced; and the accompanying visuals look artificial and constructed. Later in the film, when these exact same shots appear a second time, within the proper context, they are captivating.<br/><br/>By the time the credits rolled I was a statue. Overcome, hand pressing chest, I was near tears. I mean yes, during the first few minutes I thought my eyes might become lodged in the back of my head because I couldn't stop rolling them. The film got off to a weak start. But the further it ran the better it got. The performances were devastating, in the best way possible. Only two complaints about the picture come to mind. One, the terrible makeup and costumes. Even though this was a movie rather than a film... the costumes and makeup were still too movie-ish; not natural enough, not realistic enough. At more than one point I was aware that the actors were walking around in costumes.<br/><br/>My second qualm is the title card stating that the film is based on a true story. The phrase is a dumb fad, and I am so sick of seeing this imbecilic claim in, like, every second film made now. The fact is that every movie is inspired by life. Yes, the story in ""12 Years"" does come from the memoir Twelve Years A Slave (1853) by the real Solomon Northup. But not only is the ""based on"" annotate redundant; it is inaccurate. McQueen can call his character Solomon... but on the plantations the real Solomon Northup was on, the people probably didn't have a constant orchestra concerto playing in the background, and they probably didn't speak in such perfectly succinct, articulate sentences. And in his memoir, Solomon doesn't mention having his life saved by Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>""12 Years A Slave"" is not a masterpiece, but it is a great film. With slavery being abolished, hopefully the film will not only inspire critical thought, but critical action against current persecutions; the most pressing being the barbaric attitudes toward homosexuality.<br/><br/>screenplayisles.blogspot"
"daniel-cutlass","9","0","1","10 May 2014"," Breaking the silence
","Solomon Northup had his own little slice of heaven: a devoted wife, two lovely children, and his agile mind and talent with the violin had earned him a modest prosperity. But because he lived in 1841, and because he was African-American, his own skin made him a target for the thugs who kidnapped him and sold him into slavery. ""I don't want to survive. I want to live,"" he tells his fellow slaves as a steamship chugs them southward to their fate. But living is not an option for a slave; survival and death are the only alternatives, and there really isn't much else to the story but to watch how Solomon survives for the next twelve years, until freedom finally gives him the chance to live again.<br/><br/>Before I watched this movie, if you asked me ""What is slavery?"" I would probably have answered something like ""Being forced to work without pay."" But I think Steve McQueen, director of 12 Years A Slave, would answer quite differently. He deliberately de-emphasizes the raw sweat and pain involved in cutting lumber, hacking sugarcane, and picking cotton. Indeed, Solomon and his fellow slaves' work, and the singing that goes with it, is shown as the least of the horrors they must face. In McQueen's eyes, the essential fact of slavery is being at the absolute mercy of another human being, and you are blessedly lucky if all that human being does to you is make you work without pay. Your master can rape you, whip you, hang you, rob you of your parents or children, or cut up your face to placate whatever inner demons he or she has. He may even force you to do any of these things to your best friend. You can be the hardest-working, most productive slave on a plantation, and still have your back cut to bloody shreds merely because you procured the soap to wash yourself like a human being.<br/><br/>Above all, your master can and will silence you. Forced silence is one of the major themes of 12 Years A Slave. When we first meet Solomon Northup as he cuts sugarcane for a Louisiana judge, neither he nor his fellow slaves ever speak a word. We see an entire scene of seduction and sex where neither person says anything. Then we flash back to Solomon's life in New York, and finally hear his voice, bantering with friends and intoning endearments to his family. Solomon's first encounter with whipping is his punishment for insisting on the truth that he is a free man, not a runaway slave. His next owner slaps him for saying his name is Solomon, not the runaway Platt that his white owner claims he is. Eventually, Solomon absorbs the lesson, and even tries to silence his fellow slave Eliza, who cannot stop crying for her lost children. This is one of the few victories that Solomon wins in this story. He never secures the release of his fellow slaves, and he loses all of his battles in court to recover the twelve years of wages stolen from him and to punish the criminals who kidnapped him. It is not even clear whether he died a free man or not. But he does break free from silence; he writes the story of what happened to him, and we can still hear it today if we listen. <br/><br/>12 Years A Slave, like Toni Morrison's Beloved, avoids the temptation to show all the white slave-owners as evil. As important as it is to recognize the cruelty and sadism of men like Epps and Morrison's Schoolteacher; important as it is to recognize the horrible consequences they caused; still, overemphasizing these sorts of human scum leads to the dangerous and wrong conclusion that slavery would have been all right if only the white masters had been better people. That's the importance of men like Ford, or Morrison's Garners; they show that even when a slave owner is an ordinary decent person, slavery will still degrade and dehumanize his slaves, and corrupt all human warmth and friendship between him and his chattels. One of the most poignant moments in the movie is when Ford rewards Solomon for a clever idea by presenting him with an expensive new violin. We know that Ford thinks he has done the right thing; we can see that Solomon knows and appreciates this, and yet we can also see that Solomon is crushingly disappointed. What he really wanted was his freedom.<br/><br/>Not that 12 Years A Slave is perfect. Like most ""issue"" movies, it tends to lose its characters in its social and political points. Despite a tour-de-force performance by Chiwete Ejiofor, we never really get to know Solomon Northup very well. He's a sort of Everyman, none of his pre-slavery life or his reactions to his new life of bondage are idiosyncratic or distinctive. This maximizes sympathy at the expense of empathy. Less importantly, but also less excusably, the antebellum New York Solomon lives in appears completely free of all racial prejudice, which is hardly an accurate description of the city even now, much less then. It hardly seems likely that Solomon Northup would have been welcome as a customer at a high-class Washington DC restaurant, when (as the movie points out) black men were not even permitted to testify in Washington courts at that time. While the South certainly did more than its share of dirt to African-Americans during this country's history, I wouldn't blame white Southerners for being sick of bearing the blame alone while the North's own history of discrimination and violence is ignored.<br/><br/>But, unlike many ""issue"" movies, 12 Years A Slave avoids superficiality and banality. It is not, by any means, the first American movie to take on slavery; all the more impressive, then, that it has something new to say about it."

But overall, I felt the movie was over- hyped and did little-to-nothing to contribute to commentary on the era."
"eshaines","6","0","1","26 April 2014"," Unbelievable!
","The eloquent manner with which Steve McQueen conveys the injustice of slavery, a mere microcosm of centuries of endemic cowardice and brutality, can truly only be compared to the emotional depths of Amistad, the acclaimed film from the 1990's. I don't presume to know about slavery beyond what films and novels have provided in terms of storytelling, or beyond the scope of the university classroom; but I cannot imagine a more brutal, cruel intensity than this film manages to grasp for. <br/><br/>The story, recorded to be true, follows twelve years in the life of Solomon Northup, a free man from New York state who is kidnapped and sold into slavery in Georgia. He is removed from his family, savagely beaten, betrayed, condescended to, and reduced from an educated, prosperous livelihood to one of unspoken nothingness to which his kidnappers and ""masters"" have devalued him and forced him to work inhumanely. He witnesses and is forced to participate in the deaths and beatings of many fellow slaves, and is driven to the point of an inner turmoil that, despite Ejiofor's breathtaking portrayal, even the most empathetic of us cannot fully fathom. Eventually, toward the end of his twelve years of forced servitude, he meets a free man from Canada (played by the always refreshing talent, Brad Pitt) who is hired as a paid laborer to work alongside Solomon--or Platt, as he is referred to during those twelve years; upon hearing Solomon's story- -and God knows how Solomon was able to trust anyone after the series of betrayals he fell victim to--this man decides to help liberate him by finding Solomon's friends in the North and having them provide documentation of his freedom. Then one day, one of Solomon's old friends appears to cart him off back home, and does, threatening upon leaving to counter-sue Mr. Northup's now-former ""master"" if he tries to claim legal rights to him ever again. This is one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film, although there are many: the resolution with which Northup walks into the carriage to finally accept his rightful freedom, the brief burst of fervor with which his friend stands up for him to show that Epps no longer holds Northup's life in his hands, the despair Patsey expresses watching her friend disappear, all translate to an emotionally charged denouement. Northup cleans up, his hair now graying, arrives home for the first time in twelve years, walks into the front door of his old house where his wife, two children, son-in-law, and grandson who was named after him are all awaiting him to receive a much needed recompense for years spent apart and wondering. The burden of guilt he feels for leaving his family without him for so long is assuaged by his wife, who comforts him by saying that no apology is necessary on his part.<br/><br/>Incredible. All the awards this film garnered are fully justified, and I think it deserves even more than it received. Lupita Nyong'o, in her three or four scenes in which she speaks, steals the show effortlessly and with poignancy and grace; everyone can already tell, as evidenced by her Oscar win, that she does not take acting lightly, and has talent and staying power that will keep her career, and our viewing experience, in continuance. <br/><br/>Watching Chiwetel Ejiofor in the title role in this film is an emotional roller-coaster, a visual treat, and highly necessary to for the completion of our obviously fragmented understanding of any suffering endured long ago. The stories of slavery are so few and far between, because the unsavory nature of it all, the fact that fellow human beings were capable of such willful ignorance, somehow turns us off to their reality. But I find stories like these (and apparently there were many, though few with equally resolute and ""just"" endings) highly necessary to our historical understanding of cruelty and what to do when laws are so driven by greed that the human component is outrightly forgotten. Unfortunately, slavery continues today all over the world, though it has morphed from plantation slavery to sweatshops, illegal sex trades, farm cruelty, and unjust, monopolized corporate work conditions. For many people, slavery is not only a memory passed down by one's ancestors or history books, but a very present reality that still requires legal and philanthropic action in order to change. <br/><br/>Watching this film has a bittersweet quality: on the one hand, the United States has come so far, legally speaking, and in terms of racial equality, from the era about which this account was written, nearly 200 years ago; yet, the tragedy, other than that any of this cruelty or suffering had to be endured by anyone at all, is that those whom Solomon eventually prosecuted more or less went unpunished, since a black man was unable to bring a white man to justice in the nation's capital at the time. The beauty is the publicity and acclaim that Northup's story has received since the book's publication, and now, in climax, the film's release and subsequent Oscar attention. It serves as a monument to endurance in the face of extreme adversity, stolen identity, and prolonged despair, as well as to the work which still needs to be done to continually preserve and redefine equality to include all living, breathing, and feeling beings.<br/><br/>Let us not forget the amazing gift that Northup has given by sharing his story--not only in using his voice to bring poetic justice to his former ""owners"" and further freedom to himself--but because in using art as a medium for conveying his struggle, he has created a chain reaction of concern and insight into the depths of human cowardice and greed among his ever-growing audience.<br/><br/>Here's to a life well-lived, and the hope that it was not lived in vain. Thank you for your story, Solomon, and thank you to all who made its portrayal on the big screen possible."

"Buddy-51","9","0","2","24 April 2014"," A movie every American must see
","Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning masterpiece ""12 Years a Slave"" is one of the first movies about slavery to actually be told from the viewpoint of the slaves. I know that seems an odd thing to say, but Hollywood's past is littered with well-intentioned dramas that, driven by the need to appeal to the widest possible audience, have filtered their racially- charged stories through the eyes of sympathetic white characters, who are there not merely to right moral wrongs and to alleviate the sufferings of the afflicted, but to make the audience feel better about themselves, secure in the knowledge that THEY would surely never have participated in anything so vile or unjust had they been there at the time. Not that that aren't a few ""decent"" slave owners around - ""decent"" being but a relative term here - but those who made ""12 Years a Slave"" have no intention of letting the audience off the hook so easily. As Eliza - a woman who has had her two children cruelly ripped away from her and sold to someone else - points out to a fellow slave when he begins to describe the plantation master as a decent man, no person who buys and sells other human beings as property can ever be described as decent or good.<br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" is based on the experiences of Solomon Northrup, a freeman living in New York who literally woke up one day in 1841 to find himself kidnapped, shackled and sold into slavery in the South. Northrup was an educated man, a farmer, a violinist, a husband and a father of two, but none of that was enough to protect him from the scourge of slavery that had imprisoned so many of his fellow black men and women in the country. Upon his eventual release, Northrup wrote a memoir entitled ""12 Years a Slave,"" chronicling his years in captivity, which has now been adapted into an Oscar-winning screenplay by John Ridley. <br/><br/>Among other things, ""12 Years a Slave"" is probably the most honest and unflinching portrayal of the realities of slavery ever captured on film, a reality that regularly included rapes, lashings, lynchings, the rending of families, and the non-stop degradation and de-humanization - all sanctioned by society and codified into law - of a whole race of people. <br/><br/>On a broader scale, the movie also conveys what it was like having to live in a constant state of fear that a mere look, word or gesture - or even the slightest hint of self-defense or standing up for oneself or others - could result in a beating, a flogging or perhaps even death. It also shows what it was like being constantly at the mercy of some racist overseer's mood or whim, with no legal recourse or hope for justice - and the despairing belief that it would forever be thus. That is the world McQueen brings so vividly to life in ""12 Years a Slave.""<br/><br/>The movie also portrays how slaves were often forced to turn on each other to alleviate their own suffering or perhaps improve their own chances of survival.<br/><br/>In a highly risky but ultimately effective move, Ridley has chosen to provide dialogue whose elevated diction and syntactic complexity sounds vaguely strange to the modern ear. Even the uneducated slaves talk in this manner. It's a bit unsettling at first, but it underlines just how dedicated these filmmakers are to exploring the truth. Also unsettling is the harsh discordant horn that blares at various moments of intense suffering or high drama throughout the film.<br/><br/>As Solomon, Chiwetel Ejiofor has the difficult task of bringing depth and wisdom to a character who is forced by circumstances to be reticent and passive. Yet, Ejiofor, in many small and subtle ways, allows us to see the man of strength and determination lurking behind the servile exterior. In a relatively small role, Lupita Nyong'o made enough of an impression on the Academy to walk off with the Best Supporting Actress Oscar portraying a young slave named Patsey, who may have found ""favor"" with the plantation master but who's life has become a living hell as a result. There are excellent performances as well by Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye, Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Because the movie IS so faithful to the brutal realities of slavery, it has earned the rather unfair reputation of being ""too difficult to watch,"" a fact that may have limited the size of its potential audience both in theaters and at home. Let me just say that, for all its harshness, ""12 Years a Slave"" is no more violent or ""unwatchable"" than any number of movies or TV shows from now or the recent past. Not by a long shot. In fact, I can think of at least a half a dozen shows currently running on cable TV that are far more violent than ""12 Years a Slave"" is. So if this is the reason why you may have been avoiding checking out one of the finest films of recent years, you might want to rethink that decision and at least give it a try. You won't regret it."

","Director Roman Polanski once said that when making a film, ""you have to show violence the way it is. If you don't show it realistically, then that's immoral and harmful. If you don't upset people, then that's obscenity"". His quotes applies to Steve McQueen's honest and terrifying indie film in every way. This film doesn't sugar coat the brutality of slavery by using quick cuts or flashy editing, and thus we the audience are forced to see everything from whippings to lynchings and even the rape of a slave.<br/><br/>Compared to other larger, more mainstream Hollywood films, this film does not take pride in its violence and has something that many modern films, especially if they are aimed at a larger audience, lack... humanity. The depictions of cruelty hit much harder than an average Hollywood film where the violence would normally be edited or shown off screen or even be shown in a glorifying manner, and through these images the audience is able to feel for the characters. To experience the pain and hardships that Solomon Northup endured in a dark time in American history firsthand is emotionally draining but at the same time it awakens us to the reality of an evil that still occurs today in many countries. We want him to succeed and we feel his pain.<br/><br/>Within all of the film's depictions of intolerance and cruelty, there is also a strong message of the perseverance of the human spirit. Solomon Northup maintains his will to live despite all of the horrors that he is forced to endure and remains a strong character throughout the film. It is a relatable message, that one can survive the most grueling odds through the force of willpower, and it is one that rings true even today. Whether it be poverty, illness, bullying, or any other obstacle, one can survive and conquer the odds through their will to live and succeed.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is a harrowing, masterfully crafted film that should be viewed by everyone at least once. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important film because of its emotional, humane, and even educational values. I greatly admire this film because of its messages of perseverance and humanity. This is one of the greatest films of all time."

","I get the feeling that Steve McQueen is still more of a visual artist than a storyteller, so that, for all the talent and craftsmanship on display, ""Twelve Years"" seems surprisingly detached and uninvolving. In the only scene that did connect for me, Solomon joins in, with increasing fervor, as his fellow slaves sing ""Roll, Jordan, Roll"" beside the grave of an old man who collapsed in the cottonfields, and here, I think, the effect may be the opposite of what McQueen intended as Solomon's steely stoicism gives way to something like Christian resignation. A low-key episode in which Solomon's logistic skills as a lumberman and raftsman, acquired as a free man in the North, excite the murderous envy of a white plantation carpenter seemed more effective than the expected lashings and lynchings and sexual exploitation. <br/><br/>As with ""Argo,"" another Oscar winner with ""true story"" origins, I was surprised by the way the script makes room for routine invented scenes (like the one in which a defiant Michael K. Williams is summarily killed off on board the steamship) while overlooking what seems like sure-fire plot material (the real Solomon was able to get a letter to his family from New Orleans, so they knew he'd been kidnapped but had no idea where he was). Later there's a scene in which Solomon takes a few steps off the path to the general store and immediately runs into the dreaded ""paterollers"" about to lynch two suspected runaways...Seems a bit coincidental; anyone know if that was in the book as well? Great performances, great cinematography, but in the end McQueen's chilly filmmaking style and John Ridley's uneven screenplay really blunt the impact of this powerful material."

This movie turns an empathetic eye to the struggles of our hero as he gets chewed up, swallowed, and (thankfully) spit back out by the machine that is slavery.<br/><br/>Now, the phrase 'based on a true story' is one of the most blatant abuses in Hollywood today and it's refreshing to see such a powerful real-life story take such advantage of that much-abused concept.<br/><br/>And powerful it is.<br/><br/>Now, the story of Slavery is probably the single largest mark of shame in all of American history (with some competition of course) and 12 Years a Slave treats it as the inhumane atrocity that it is without sensationalizing it or making it a cliché-ridden melodrama like it could have become. In fact, this movie's willingness to stray away from being a cliché and trite pity-fest is what sets it apart as a cinematic recounting of historical events.<br/><br/>Every single time this movie appears to drift into the territory of audience-pleasing it takes a sharp-left turn by mercilessly subjecting the audience to one atrocity after another. From the excruciatingly dragged-out attempted lynching scene to the bold and challenging whipping scene, this movie pulls no punches in its quest to examine the evils of institutionalized abuse.<br/><br/>While the brutality of the on-screen violence does wonders, what 12 Years a Slave does to be classified as the best movie about slavery instead of an excellent movie about slavery is how, instead of focusing on how 'being a slave is bad,' it takes its time to develop that thesis into the much more all-encompassing 'slavery is bad.' Any hackneyed director can show a slave being tortured and say to the audience that ""see, all of the atrocities committed as a part of slavery is bad!"" 12 Years a Slave, with its wonderful direction by Steve McQueen (the not-dead one), makes it go one step further by saying that the very idea of slavery (saying that a person is not a person and therefore another man's property) is fundamentally wrong.<br/><br/>It is this commitment to an ideological critique of slavery that makes this one of the smartest movies in recent memory. That is, not to say that this movie is complicated or obfuscatory like other so-called 'smart' movies (We'll get to some of those soon enough), it is that it is an extremely focused critique that can genuinely enlighten a viewer to a new way of seeing things (instead of a movie that makes the viewer think they're enlightened).<br/><br/>Everyone always talks about a few things about this movie especially the top-notch acting (note: I stand by my statement that Chiwetel Ejiofor was robbed at the Oscars), I noticed something that very few critics didn't: the excellent score. Much like how it steers away from being a cliché historical piece, the soundtrack doesn't want to be cliché either. Instead of a grand, sweeping score that evokes the feelings of time gone by, this soundtrack is wonderfully minimalist, perfectly fitting every scene it appears in and not appearing in any scenes where it wouldn't. The oft-repeated string motif that appears all throughout the film is perhaps the perfect representation of Solomon's unfounded hope for escape even in the darkest of times and sounds as if it wouldn't be out-of-place on a Godspeed You! Black Emperor album, showing how good a movie soundtrack could be when it deviates from the norm.<br/><br/>Just as Schindler's List has become the best cinematic representation of the Holocaust, 12 Years a Slave will go down in history as one of the best portrayals of Slavery. Thanks to a pointed ideological critique of the darkest times of American history and a audience-crushing sense of despair, 12 Years a Slave is one of the best movies in the last several years and should be required watching for any American citizen.<br/><br/>originally posted on http://cinemacountdown.wordpress.com/"

","Sometimes, I just have to stop my brain in the middle of a film and just admire its exceptional craftsmanship. I found myself doing that time and time again during this film. Perhaps I was more open to admiring the shot compositions and acting choices because, as I cynically told myself before the film, it's not like I needed much convincing that slavery was bad. Or perhaps it was because I was shielding myself from the honest brutalities the film convincingly portrayed. Nonetheless, I was reminded of the film ""Children of Men,"" because when I watched that, I was struck by how easily I could imagine a less engaging, more dumbed-down version of the same film. I haven't seen enough films about slavery to know this for certain, but I suspect that because many of this film's principals are British, telling a story about a free man who was forced into slavery, as opposed to one born into it, they were able to be gain some valuable distance from the subject and craft something that's both beautiful and feels true to life. And even though I thought I could not have been made to feel worse than I already did about slavery, the post-scripts on the lack of justice Solomon received for his kidnapping and the unknown causes of his death, helped keep the film from lapsing into a kind of ""triumph of the spirit"" happy ending others might have imposed."

","Oppression, Slavery and the likes had always carved its niche in Hollywood and it has undoubtedly earned its position so, thanks to wonderful movies like Amistad, Glory, Lincoln and the more recent Django Unchained. Often coming off as powerful dramas, it was never a subject to be taken lightly unless its something from Quentin Tarantino where he injected his own style in Django Unchained. Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, based on the memoir of the same name, tells the story of Solomon Northup, a respected freeman who gets tricked, drugged and kidnapped into being a slave for 12 years.<br/><br/>Unlike McQueen's previous movies, 12 Years a Slave can be enjoyed by a casual moviegoer. Its a straight to the point drama; something I had not expected from McQueen. I do enjoy his movies, and although not a huge fan, both Hunger and Shame had its own place in my best movies of the year list. Handling racism and other sensitive issues, 12 Years a Slave could have gone too crazy and some sequences had too but it is the hard truth and 12 Years a Slave doesn't shy away from showing you how gruesome and cruel things really were. If you can't tolerate a representation of things that comes close to genuine history then this isn't for you either. Previously in movies we were introduced characters who were born-slaves but here in 12 Years a Slave we get to see a freeman circumstantially becoming a slave and we get to see the contrast clearly. It is shocking at times, a constant air of dread suspended from start to end and yet making you wonder there'd be something pleasant at the end of that dark tunnel.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave stars a wide array of AAA stars. Chiwetel Ejiofor is inexplicably good as Solomon, his helplessness, his craving to get back to his family, everything had been acted out perfect. Michael Fassbender plays Edwin Epps and this guy is really becoming one of the most dynamic actors of our times. Already a McQueen favorite and having acted in both Hunger and Shame, Fassbender's Epps is one of the most spiteful characters I've seen on screen and to imagine the character was indeed real, just EVIL. Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt also livens up the screen although their screentimes, debatable. I was so impressed with Lupita Nyong'o performance, it almost felt like she wasn't even acting; arguably one of the best debut performances of 2013.<br/><br/>McQueens trademark extended scenes makes a comeback. I was amused to see Michael Fassbender jog for a good 2 minutes in Shame, while at the time it felt both odd and intriguing, it's one of the scenes I remember even now. 12 Years a Slave packs a number of memorable scenes and one among them: an extended sequence of ""the protagonist left hanging on a rope and dearly clinging on for his life"" will be remembered the same way the jogging scene from Shame. Brownie points goes for the cinematography where certain visual cues were left to tell a lot. For most times Hans Zimmer's score does wonders but I felt it a bit misplaced here nonetheless the title theme reminded me of 'Time' from Inception.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave's inevitable and imminent comparison would be to Django Unchained but believe me when I say both of them are poles apart. Of course the sheer dread of slavery has been portrayed in both but its the scenes in 12 Years a Slave that'll stick with you years from now than Django's. While Django Unchained entertained me, 12 Years a Slave made me uncomfortably shrug in my seat that makes it one of last year's powerful dramas."

","I have every Best Picture on DVD so was awaiting the release of ""12 Years as a Slave"" to disk. I had already seen how highly awarded this movie was, so expected great things from this film. OK, I'll give that the acting was superb, from the title character to the lowliest of bit players. The story was both compelling and horrific. So with great acting and story, how could this fail but to be superb. Well, it drug in places. I thought maybe the excruciation of having the story move along so slowly was intentional, to give one a sense of the passage of time under evil tyranny, but it didn't work. The 60ish, psychedelic scene transitions: the paddle wheel and water reflections quite nearly and literally gave me a headache. Am I glad I watched it? Yes! In portions, I both was entranced and wholly appalled at the brutal treatment of an enslaved group of humans. In other parts, I was so bored that I felt like turning it off. I hate to say it, but Steve McQueen is a great actor, but not such a great director. See it, but prepare to be somewhat disappointed at what was deemed as the best picture of 2013 by so very many."
"AlTheReviewer","9","0","1","13 April 2014"," 12 Years A Slave
","12 Years a Slave is based on an incredible true story of one man's fight for survival and freedom. It is gripping and brutal, a typical Steve McQueen film. It is a film that reveals the pain and torture slaves were put through in pre-civil war United States. The film has a terrific acting cast,Brad Pitt, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch are a few of the names among them. Again for me, the performance of Michael Fassbender stands out. He plays the part of Edwin Epps, a malevolent slave owner who gets pleasure from abusing the slaves he owns. Fassbender is known for playing very complex and what I consider very difficult roles in his acting career and for me, this is one of the most difficult. However, as usual he pulls off the part perfectly and makes it believable that he is the person he is playing, that is why he is my favourite actor of all time. Visually the film is stunning with great colours and great shots which is typical of a Steve McQueen film. It is a film that makes you flinch because of the brutality, but it is extremely impressive in the way that it reveals the truth, however harsh it is, it must be realised and remembered."
"doug_park2001","9","0","1","12 April 2014"," ""I simply ask that you use all of your senses before rendering judgment""
","Directed by Steve McQueen and crew, this is definitely one of the very best films to come out in recent years. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is expertly filmed and gives an immediate recreation of the antebellum South. The acting by just about everyone is similarly outstanding, with special kudos going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northrup, Sara Paulson as Mistress Ebs, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, and Paul Dano as Tibeats. This film truly captures the barbarity of slavery in America and slavery in general: The empathy with its victims is disturbingly keen. Scenes such as that of the mother being separated from her young children at the auction are realistically heartrending. This film is also revealing of the Biblical justifications that slaveholders often used and the frequency with which female slaves were raped by plantation owners and overseers. At the same time, however, all of the characters are well-rounded. Without sugarcoating anything, 12 YEARS A SLAVE portrays even the cruelest of its subjects as eminently human and shows the varying degrees of humanity and inhumanity among slaveholders. Plenty happens, with a number of reversals and surprises, but, as in many intelligent dramas, there isn't any one defining climactic moment. There are one or two vague spots, and the sheer number of characters can be confusing. Nevertheless, I cannot imagine anyone with a normal attention span and interest in the subject matter failing to be engrossed by 12 YEARS A SLAVE. Yes, this subject has been done before in a number of earlier films, but it's still done very well here.<br/><br/>As important as its subject may be, however, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is not just a film about slavery in America during the 1800s. It's about the will to power and the will to survive, human greed, human dignity, human guile and deception, and many other complications that occur between members of the human race. While it never stops to preach, the psychology of it all is powerful stuff, and there are characters in whom any modern person will find her/himself. As odd as this may sound, anyone who's ever worked at a job where they were treated disparagingly or been pressured to downplay their level of education and intelligence in order to avoid offending their ""superiors"" should immediately identify with the plights of Solomon Northrup and the other slave characters.<br/><br/>Still, if you want to just watch it for the story and don't feel like analyzing its many themes, you may easily do so. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is just a very fine, perhaps even great drama, the sort that can be watched again and again. If you enjoy this film, I might also recommend 1997's ARMISTAD."
"nina_xue","8","0","1","10 April 2014"," 12 Years a Slave: Oscar-worthy or Overrated?
","With all the Oscar buzz surrounding this film you just know '12 Years a Slave' cannot possibly disappoint. And most of it doesn't. Even though the issues explored are confronting as hell, they are explored in such a raw and yet strangely beautiful way by director Steve McQueen. One such example of this was his use of off centre close-ups with the camera lingering just long enough for us to process and reflect on what had just happened in the scene.<br/><br/>The film briefly touched on the contrast between Solomon as a free man and a black slave he passed on the street. However I felt that this could have been explored further by delving into the backstories of the other 'real' slaves. After all is Solomon's case any more unfair than the other slaves just because he was once a free man? Shouldn't we as the audience feel even more sympathy towards those who have been the property of white men for as long as they could remember? Or is Solomon's situation different because he had a proper education and was a learned man?<br/><br/>I never thought the day would come where a film could actually be improved by taking out Brad Pitt but sadly he was just too 'Brad Pitt' in this movie and really did not belong in this world at all. Brad Pitt's character really hammers the viewer over the head with the themes of the film. While he famously opted not to play Fassbender's brutal character because of his children, the rest of us probably would have lived without ""and the moral of the story is""<br/><br/>Having said that, Fassbender's character was in my opinion the most interesting and complex character. The fact that he was not completely demonised as the cruel white slave owner but was faced with an inner struggle of his own between his attraction to Patsey despite the expectations of society, including his wife.<br/><br/>For me one of the most powerful scenes in the film was the rape scene which treated such a sensitive issue with almost a sense of respect to the victim. Unlike rape scenes in other movies, there was very little physical struggle evident but her emotional barrier gave her a sense of empowerment over her attacker.<br/><br/>All in all I must say the storyline did not surprise me in any major way but the redeeming factor in this film was the hauntingly beautiful cinematography and the excellent performances by the cast ensemble (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti and Paul Dano).<br/><br/>IMDb: 8.3/10<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes: 97%<br/><br/>(From projectreel: http://projectreel.wordpress.com)"
"bob-rutzel-1","8","0","1","6 April 2014"," Well Told. Gripping.
","This is based upon a true story. <br/><br/>In 1841, freeman Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), married with children, in New York is kidnapped and sold into Slavery in Louisiana. He is given the name of Platt.<br/><br/>Watching this you may ask yourself: how can people treat people this way? There is a lot of cruelty in here and I think the point is to show us that Slavery was indeed cruel and brutal. White Slave-owners took the claim of Slaves as their property way too seriously. True, there were good Slave-owners and we see one with Benedict Cumberbatch as Ford, but that time didn't last long and even Ford was wary of his Overseers and sells his debt (Platt) to a very cruel Slave-owner: Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).<br/><br/>We see a lot of beatings and we cringe a lot. Yes, this is only a movie, but consider back in those days that things were probably much worse than what we see on the big screen. So think ""much worse"" when you watch. If you think the beatings were overdone, think again. <br/><br/>The acting all around is good. I thought the best performances in here were by Benedict Cumberbatch as Ford and by Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps. Fassbender was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and should have gotten it. Ejiofor was nominated for Best Actor and he was okay, but Matthew McConaughey was the buzz saw in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB and it was no contest within this category. <br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey won the award for Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>The picture itself won for Best Picture. Did I think it should have won Best Picture? Glad you asked. No it shouldn't have. I thought CAPTAIN PHILLIPS was the better movie. Seems that true, almost true or based upon actual events stories get the nod for an Oscar Nomination. My other choices would have been DALLAS BUYERS CLUB or THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, both based upon true stories. Maybe there should be a True Story category as they seem to have the edge. Hmmm<br/><br/>Sometimes the dialogues reminded me of the TV show DEADWOOD when we heard an almost poetic and most annoying cadence by all the characters all the time. At times in here, the dialogues were too convoluted (read cadenced) especially when a character went on explaining something as when Brad Pitt as Bass talked about coming changes in society. I am saying sometimes the dialogues did not ring true to me. People didn't talk like that. There were other times - and too often - these annoying cadence-laced dialogues were spewed out by other characters.<br/><br/>The Ending (thought you would never get to it) was okay. I mean what else could be expected? He was gone for 12-years and believed dead, and his family had moved on. So no brass band celebration. I thought this Ending was the right touch. (8/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: yes, male and female. Language: No, soft stuff only and not much of it."

Oscar deservedly went to the right movie, but it depends on the competition too. You will be glued all the way through the movie, you will feel angry and emotional at the same time, it will keep you in your seat for sure. Other than Mr. Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender did a fantastic job in my honest opinion, playing the role of Mr. Epps. That's about it. You see what happened in the land of the 'free', and you will remember it. It clearly says the world was confined by some petty nonsense, and what a disgrace of human being some of us are, and still is. It gives a clear message to that we all are equal, regardless of our differentiation in colours, religion and place. I enjoyed it thoroughly, some parts were definitely disheartening and touchy, some fine acting and direction, strong story telling, but that's about it. If you expect a masterpiece or some epic show, I can't really say you will be game. It deserves a 7.5 out of 10 from me, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading, Saurav."

","""12 Years a Slave"" follows Solomon Northup, a free black man at the middle of the 18th century in New York, who is kidnapped and sold as a slave and transported to the southern states. For the next 12 years he works in the fields, while slowly losing hope that he will ever regain his freedom. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivers a beautiful performance as Solomon, but is completely upstaged by the debuting Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o, playing the very unfortunate Patsey who suffers under constant abuse from the farm owner Edwin Epps, played by Michael Fassbender. The slavery is a big part of the American history, yet popular movies about this subject can be counted on one hand. Therefore this story is an important one to be told, and the director does so very honestly and true to History. What could easily have turned out to be a classic sob story about the pitiable black slaves turns out to be the story of an internal fight of the main character against his own destiny. The movie is very naturalistic, and virtually nothing is left to the imagination of the viewer; the movie contains brutal beating scenes and subsequent shots of completely torn-up and destroyed bodies. The movie was scored by Nicholas Britell, and he added to the movie original African working chants and the sound of Solomon's violin, furthering the very authentic feel of the movie. <br/><br/>The ending, however, does leave some to be desired. The writing is beautiful and fantastically simple (especially the line ""I apologize for my appearance. But I have had a difficult time these past several years"" is absolutely genius), and the entire situation is heart-breaking, but it seems to clash with the rest of the movie, and it really bothers me that Solomon's family seemingly have been sitting at home waiting for him for 12 years. The movie is about telling the story of the lives of slaves, and Solomon's family relations are secondary to the plot. Therefore it would have been cinematically a cleaner cut if the movie had ended with Solomon being on his way home. But the movie also has to appeal to the Hollywood audience who expect an emotional climax of the movie, so it is unfortunate, but not unexpected, to have such an over- emotional ending. <br/><br/>""12 Years a Slave"" takes a lot of brain power to watch. It is full of extremely long, static cuts and excruciatingly raw cinematography. It is exceptionally realistic, heart-wrenching and definitely not for the squeamish. But it's also beautiful, awe-inspiring, tremendously well- written and very deserving of the Academy Awards it has won (Best writing for adapted screenplay, Best performance by leading actress to Lupita Nyong'o and Best Motion Picture). The movie tells an important story to be remembered by humanity, and it deserves and needs to be seen."
"dongquan110296","8","0","1","19 March 2014"," Slave or Survivor ?
","Platt or Solomon Northup? The movie reflects a dark side of society. God evidently created mankind equally. But this sense of equality was once tremendously altered by human's sinful nature, selfishness, hatred. The main character choose to be submissive in order to survive. He never gives up despite the reality of being considered a slave and the pressure from the other hopelessly lost and pessimistic slaves. The story itself is extremely depressed with all the realistic struggling and hatreds. One of the most amazing fragments of the movie is its demonstration of spiritual hope in Lord, in a better place. Received an Oscar for playing Patsey, Lupita Nyong'o manages to bring out the best performance of a young, smart, hard working woman but sadly, lost. It is so sad to see this young girl who believes in heaven, in God also passionately believes in death that directly bring her back to where she first created. Michael Fassbender's performance is so monumental. He reflects a typical slaver: brutal, arrogant, hypocrite. Not only a historical memoir, 12 Years a Slave is a reminder to people how the evil and good parallel and stratify the society."

","I won't try and deny the impact ""12 Years a Slave"" has. The unblinking way the film looked at the torture, horror and torment that was slavery is brutal, hard to watch and leaves an emotional mark on the viewer. The film tells a great, powerful story (and interesting too since it's based on a true story) and the performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender are truly fantastichowever, I can't help but feel the movie is overrated.<br/><br/>While the film is good and it definitely made me cry at the end when Solomon Northup was finally found and set free, the movie had a very messy plot that really failed at expressing that it really was 12 years that Northup had to go through after being kidnapped and sold into slavery. I understand that director Steve McQueen and the screen writer wanted to solely show the horrors of this journey from Northup's perspective but this ended up making the film feel like it was incomplete. It jumps from scene to scene and there was no real sense of time passing. The entire film felt like it took place over a few weeks or a month or two but, suddenly as Northup is being set free, I see he has gray hair and I found myself saying, ""Well, I guess 12 years have passed."" I couldn't help but feel it would have been nice to see how his family was handling it or the progress of finding him. Without this and only seeing what Northup was going through, the movie felt like stuff was left on the editing room floor and just gave an overall sloppy appearance of the plot.<br/><br/>Did I dislike ""12 Years a Slave?"" Absolutely not. Did it feel like it wasn't living up to what it could have been? Absolutely. The film told a fantastically emotional and powerful story but it presented it in a way that looked like it was more concerned with getting as many big name actors attached to it than it was telling a complete tale.

","12 Years a Slave introduces us to Solomon Northup as a slave, unknown as to what year, before giving us a flashback to the free life he had as a family man in New York and earning a living as a violinist, who is then hired by two men for a job trip to play in Washington, to only then be drugged, kidnapped and sold into slavery, heading to New Orleans.<br/><br/>For the duration of the film we then go through the time line of Solomon's time in slavery, going through a few slave owners, from actually he isn't that bad for a slave owner in William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) to you have just enter a place where you'd rather be dead than end up here in the Epps household (Michael Fassbender and Sarah Poulson). Things take a turn for the worst at the Ford household as John Tibeats (Paul Dano) resents Solomon for being on good terms with William and for some of his ideas (like the transporting logs on the river) and begins to verbally abuse him at every opportunity, till it escalates to a beat down, with Solomon whipping Tibeats. Then Tibeats and his friends lynch Solomon, who is then rescued by Ford after a lengthy time (and a lengthy one shot take) and for his own safety, is sold off to Edwin Epps.<br/><br/>Epps sees Solomon and every other black person at his household as his property and believes he has the right to do whatever he pleases with him, be it making then dance for him to provide entertainment or whip them for not providing a certain amount of weight gathered from cotton picking. Just as horrible as drunkard Edwin is his wife (Sarah Poulson) who is envious of her husbands attentions and praise at their slave named Patsey, which leads down to one of the most brutal moments in the film.<br/><br/>12 Years a Slave is a film that will be discussed about for a long time to come, in particular in certain scenes. Them certain scenes will be the one between William Ford and slave salesman Freeman (Paul Giamatti) as Eliza's children are taken away from her to go to separate owners, to the brutal moment of Solomon having to lash Patsey in front of the Epps.<br/><br/>The film is unapologetic in its approach to the story as after all, it is based on a true story and mostly what you see is what happened. So for the same reasons as The Wolf of Wall Street, some people may find certain moments in 12 Years a Slave to have a similar repetitive pattern (Solomon stands up for himself, gets abused verbally/physically, moves to different slave owner) and, this could be just me or the years of the gore horror genre we've been treated to the last decade, you are just numb for some of the beatings, till you get to that pivotal one with Patsey getting one of the most visually brutal lashes captured on camera. It's a very good film but you could argue that it is too true to the source material in that you aren't as emotionally invested as you should be (didn't really care for the majority of the other slaves, even with them being played by talented actors such as Chris Chalk and Michael Kenneth Williams as they are literally come and go in minutes), the only other two that last longer than ten minutes are Patsey and Eliza. Agreed partially with it being one of the best films ever made with the way it is shot but in terms of story, it's brutal and in your face but all the while lacking development for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>Everyone though does a terrific job in their roles. Chiwetel Ejiofor gave everything in his role as Solomon Northup and deserved his Oscar nomination, showing us a man with pride and dignity slowly deteriorate away as the years go by till you see it in his eyes, that one moment where he accepts that he is going to be 'Platt' forever. Michael Fassbender gives in to his role as Edwin Epps with such menace and terrifying portrayal of one of the many slave owners that caused such pain. Lupita Nyong'o deserves that Oscar over Jennifer Lawrence. You cannot honestly tell me that Lawrence gave a better presence in American Hustle than Nyong'o did in this film. She brought the emotion and then some.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen was always going to be around for some time as a filmmaker after Hunger and Shamed, but now this will be the film be potentially the most discussed that he will ever do.<br/><br/>A brutal, honest portrayal of Solomon's memoirs with great performances from the main cast, though the hype may have ruined my expectations for the film. It was very good but not a bona fide classic for me. The film is at least worth the two hours of your time."

","There's no real surprise that 12 years a slave waltzed off with the best film Oscar. The plot plays perfectly for the academy. Solomon Northup (Ejiofor) is a black free man living in the New York area in the 19th Century. He is kidnapped and sold as a slave to the south and the film focuses on his life as a(n educated) slave over the next 12 years. It is based on a true story.<br/><br/>The film is always likely to be a tough watch and that was certainly true. I wasn't especially engaged by the main character, but the supporting role of Patsy (Nyongo) is very watchable. The direction of Steve McQueen is certainly good and a couple of the scenes are likely to stay with you for a long time. Definitely not for the feint hearted!"

","I wish Brad Pitt had not been in this movie. It was a very small part and there were probably hundreds of actors who could have done it better without the big name distraction. This was not a Woody Allen satire to pepper with cameos. This wasn't an actor portraying Bass, it was Brad Pitt espousing the injustice of racism. He even had a bit of a smirk as he spoke, when it would have been far more appropriate to be solemn and sincere. It was disrespectful to the 'message', selfish of Mr Pitt, disruptive to the viewing experience. Really? Is that the best you could have done?? <br/><br/>Otherwise, a great movie about a horrible subject, hard to watch, the brutality that we are capable of when we are afraid."

I was prepared for the brutality, almost over-prepared, as I thought it would be akin to Schindler's List, but it is a much different movie. I noticed Chiwetel Ejiofor in ""Serendipity"" a while ago, and it's good to see him in a meaningful movie doing an excellent acting job. He acts his character as dignified yet confused and vulnerable, and still hopeful. Director McQueen also deserves praise for attention to detail. Being almost 150 years since Slavery's abolition, the oldest person in the world is still likely 2 generations removed from it. There is no-one left to give 1st person accounts of it. This story helps to try to bring it front and center to remind us that it was real and a bold stain on America's young History. Indeed Slavery's roots though are much older. (spoiler) The graphic lashing scene conjured up thoughts of Roman times and protected barbarism. From the story, you can see how many wretched, greedy, ignorant and uneducated people might have truly indulged in the diseased power of it, and likewise the rampant fear as a result. I liked the depth that the movie brought the abuse to light. 8/10"

","Before watching 12 Years a Slave, I feared it to be too depressing, and on some way, it ended up being like that. However, screenwriter John Ridley and director Steve McQueen show us the most terrible sufferings of the slaves without losing of sight the main character's internal fortitude, avoiding the film to degenerate into a hollow parade of pain capable of desensitizing the audience. The excellent performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor (one of my favorite actors, by the way) is focused on keeping the hope alive despite the adversity, and he achieved it with an amazing subtleness in the use of his expressions. The supporting cast also made a solid work, highlighting Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and Paul Giamatti in characters which must have been incredibly difficult to play. On the negative side from 12 Years a Slave, a few scenes feel too sentimental, while other ones feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend 12 Years a Slave as a very solid drama."

Credits also should be given to three main casts (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o) who steals attention with their unbelievable performance.

","12YAS is the most powerful film among the Best Picture nominees this year, at least when it comes to emotional terms. In fact emotion runs the show in this Steve McQueen directed film. Chiwetej Ejiofor fits the leading man's shoes perfectly and he is the heart and soul of the movie. In a year where Leo DiCaprio and Matthew McConuaghey gave enormous performances, Chiwetel may have to settle for the nomination. This is also an actors movie by excellence, so much that I highlight from the large cast Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o, both Oscar nominated performances. McQueen's take on this tale is one of a very dark nature, one that is not for everybody. One particular scene is terrifically cringe worthy as you see a sight too horrible to behold. While it may not feel as fresh as other contenders, 12 Years A Slave is a wonderful film that depicts a dark time in American history. Recent movies about slavery have been getting a little backlash as they are becoming far too insistent. I believe that when well done, like in this case, it's no problem that this topic is presented. In fact I encourage it.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"
"natashabowiepinky","7","0","2","21 February 2014"," A sobering depiction of a tragic time...
","Yes, this is the film that'll sweep the Oscars... it's already guaranteed. You see, Hollywood loves 'meaningful' films, so how could it possibly turn it's nose up at a drama which depicts just over a decade of suffering of a black man at the hands of those nasty whites? I may sound cynical, but if there's one thing I've learnt you can never be TOO skeptical as far as cinema politics are concerned. Movies frequently win prizes because of the 'issues' surrounding them, not due to any specific quality. It's Tinseltown's way of proving it can still connect with the people on one hand, while burning money to light their cigars with the other. Don't fall for it. Anyway, onto the review...<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiofor (In the 40's they would have made him change it to Charlie Smith on the film poster) stars as a free man back when slavery was still rampant. He lives in quite a plush house with his family, and he makes a living playing musical instruments. One day, under the guise of hiring him for a job, two white men kidnap him and transport him to a plantation for manual labour. All his protestations that he's not a slave fall on deaf ears, and soon he finds himself being worked to within an inch of his life, and beaten on a regular basis. Friends are few and far between, and the ones he think he has made have a nasty habit of betraying him. Will he ever get back to his old life? Well, watch it and find out! <br/><br/>I was most surprised at the end when it emerged that this is actually based on a book written by a former slave, when the practice was still legal in the 19th century. How on Earth did he managed to find a publisher willing to take the risk of putting it out there, at a time of such hostility to ethnic minorities? It just goes to show, that not everyone was as colour blind back then as you'd believe. He even managed to have his abductors arrested in court and charged, along with his slavemaster... but needless to say, the case soon collapsed. At least his example must have blazed a trail for all future enforced captives, which helped to see an end to this disgusting operation.<br/><br/>It feels more like a documentary than a film, as we observe our lead's suffering at the hands of his captors, while all around him are similarly under the yoke of a brutal regime. Children are separated from their mothers, women are abused by unscrupulous men, whippings are dished out for the most mild of infractions... it was a harsh, cruel world out there. There are periods where not very much happens though, this might be realistic to the original text, but it does drag proceedings down in patches. Fortunately, for the most part it is a thought-provoking, moving experience... Ejiofor is hugely sympathetic as the lead, and everyone else successfully sinks into their respective parts, to provide us with a reminder of a time we don't wanna go back to, thank you very much.<br/><br/>So the movie might actually be worth sweeping the board at the Academy Awards on it's own merits. I don't know... I haven't seem many of the nominees. Well, apart from Gravity. And don't get me started on THAT again... 7/10"

Starting for the great set of actor who took part in this project to the beautiful world we used to live in, this film has potential to become a big winner in the Oscars and my personal vote is for Michael Fassbender. His hideous character was done perfectly. My only complain is that they repeated a song perhaps 6 times which had a strange resemble to Hanz Zimmmer's ""Time"" (Inception).

Not only is Chiwetel Ejiofor a British man playing an American, he portrays his role consistently well and convincingly. Other great performances from Fassbender, Cumberbatch and Lupita Nyong'O. There are some scenes that are hard to watch, but you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs, and to be fair what would a film about the evil of slavery be without a little gore?

At one point my girlfriend asked me to it off, I refused.<br/><br/>12 years a slave tells the story of Solomon Northup a free black man living in the north of America who gets kidnapped and forced into slavery in the south for as you can guess 12 years.

It wont be the last time you see Nyong'o nominated for an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender. wherever a Steve McQueen masterpiece is found Fassbenders not far behind.

","I finally got around to watching 12 Years A Slave after hearing all these great things about it. I have to say I was a little bit disappointed, I was expecting more from the film. It is brutal to watch. Its graphic in its brutality, violence and de- humanization of slaves. The movie goes there and a lot of the scenes were hard to watch both because of the honest performances and the fact that this is a part of our history. I will never be able to understand how people could side with slavery in the free world much less with the horrible treatment of blacks during this time. Its disgusting. On the technical side, this is a fantastic movie. The direction, acting, cinematography and set design was beautifully done. The actors were all committed to telling this story and everyone gave commendable performances. For me the standout was Michael Fassbender, who played the sadistic slave owner Epps with such abhorrent charisma. But the story was lacking, it simply wasn't that strong. It took me a while to get used to the erratic timeline of the film that flips between the past and present. To me this is a story that exists as a showcase for the hardships of Solomon and the slaves. It was as if the film was solely focused on emphasizing the horrors of that time and it didn't pay much attention to clever writing tropes, which is understandable given the subject matter. Though it succeeded in bringing to life the disgusting treatment of blacks by whites during slavery, it was lacking in something more. 12 Years A Slave is a movie that everyone should watch, excluding young kids unless they want to be traumatized, because it is history and its something that people need to remember especially given the fact that racism still exists. But in my opinion it just isn't that amazing of a film. Maybe if the script was better, tighter, then I think I would love this film more. But to me its just a lesser version of Schindler's List."

"hkauteur","9","0","2","14 February 2014"," HK Auteur film review - 12 Years A Slave
","Based on the memoirs of Solomon Northup, it recounts the story of Northup, a free black carpenter and musician living in upstate New York, who gets kidnapped and illegally sold as a slave to the south for twelve years.<br/><br/>Solomon Northup is the role of a lifetime and Chiwitel Ejiofor delivers it in full, leaving the viewer in moments of shock, fear and awe. Solomon's inner conflict between resisting his new slave identity to the sad eventual acceptance is all communicated through Ejiofor's face and body, as he is forbidden to speak. And it is in witness of terrible things, we see Solomon grasping tight onto his own values and dignity that makes his situation all the more endearing. It is impressive how we can see what Ejiofor is thinking in every moment. There is noteworthy long take where Solomon quietly contemplates his own fate, his eyes slowly look towards the camera and it struck me dead still. Even though Matthew McConaughey is still my pick for the Oscar this year, it's going to be ultimately between McConaughey and Chiwitel Ejiofor. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender's Edwin Epps is one of the most despicable evil on screen characters in recent memory and probably for the ages. Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Sarah Paulson and Benedict Cumberbatch all give fine supporting performances. What dark nether place the Caucasian actors are going mentally to breathe life into playing slavers is unfathomable. It is quite a sight to behold that level of evil being performed.<br/><br/>As producer, Brad Pitt didactically shows up in a small part to say the entire point of the story. While good in the part, Pitt's appearance seems for more political reasons than purely for story reasons. It is not big enough of a problem to say he is miscast, but some may find it hokey or jarring. <br/><br/>Newcomer Lupita Nyong'o is spectacular as Epp's most prized slave Patsy, capable of picking five hundred pounds of cotton per day, but the achievement brings her more harm than relief. What happens to Patsy is even more heartbreaking than Solomon's situation. Because of this, Nyong'o becomes the heart of the story in the latter half, as she represents the majority of slaves who were never free to begin with and never will be. Nyong'o is my pick for the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. <br/><br/>The physical violence is hard to watch. However, the non-violent scenes offer an insight not prevalent in other slave films, answering Quentin Tarantino's proposed question ""Why don't slaves just kill their masters and escape in the middle of the night?"" from Django Unchained. Steve McQueen gets beneath of how slavery works psychologically and shows its emotional violence. The way the slaves are sold posed completely naked, shower in groups outdoors like animals, and dance and sing in the middle of the night to amuse their masters, the power of slavery is not the threat of the whip but the overwhelming sense of human degradation that weighs them to the eventual surrender of one's humanity.<br/><br/>Needless to say, 12 Years A Slave is an intense and upsetting experience. The story is masterfully visualized by McQueen, showing the horror of slavery through how society deemed it normal and acceptable. The awards recognition it has gained is well deserved and has nothing to do with the fact that it is a film about slavery or playing to the white guilt in Oscar voters. The majority of audiences will probably only be able to stomach the experience once, as the gut-wrenching nature of it may not be friendly to watching it again. My suggestion: go see it once, but see it in full with your eyes wide open and soak it all in for what it is. It is a work of social and historical significance."
"jtindahouse","8","0","2","14 February 2014"," Where is Django when you need him?
","'12 Years a Slave' is a hard-hitting, honest film told passionately through the eyes of director Steve McQueen. It tells the true story of a free black man, Solomon Northup, who is abducted and sold into slavery. It is engaging and captivating and never relents for a second. It is very difficult to watch at times and never for the faint-hearted.<br/><br/>The only real issue it has is that it's rather unsatisfying. Unlike 2012's 'Django Unchained' this film doesn't circle back and wrap things up nice and neatly for us at the end. We are shown our main character, Northup, returned to his family, but never get any vengeance on the evil characters we have come to know and hate during the course of the film. In fact, text is even shown at the end of the film before the credits to confirm that no justice whatsoever was attained against the abductors or the slave owners. This is historically accurate and how the film needed to be told, there's no doubt about that. But it doesn't change the fact that it is unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The two choices for ending a film like this are either a win-win or a lose-lose for a director, depending on how you choose to look at it. Quentin Tarantino's approach of giving the audience an extremely gratifying ending, was much appreciated by his audiences and fit the narrative. But he was never going to win Best Picture with his film. McQueen takes the gritty approach, and whilst I know that I'd much rather watch 'Django Unchained' again over this any day of the week (for the above reasons), he's quite likely to get the most coveted prize of all, a Best Picture win at the Oscars. I'm not entirely sure which approach I'd prefer to take given the opportunity.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o were all outstanding and deserve their respective Oscar nominations. Nyong'o was probably the best of the lot for me and fittingly has the best chance of taking home the award. Ejiofor carries the film excellently and his final scene is exceedingly moving.<br/><br/>'12 Years a Slave' is quite likely to win Best Picture at the Oscars next month. As always there will be divided opinion over whether that should be the case. Personally, I don't think it is the best film out of the nominees, but it may just be the most important. There are a lot of 'based on a true story' nominees up for Best Picture this year, but it's safe to say none of those stories will hit you anywhere near as hard as this one will."

","I had my doubts when the film first started. It was a little slow, the different time sequences were a little bit confusing but as the film went on, the plot line and imagery became vastly emotional and intense. The sheer brutality and bigotry portrayed in this film are so disgustingly real that the viewer wishes it wasn't true. The symbolism and cinematography are also beautiful. This is one of those films you can watch multiple times and get different perspectives out of it. Some of the scenes, I'll grant, are very hard to watch - kudos to McQueen for exploring this dark part of American history.

","Very occasionally, a movie comes along that outshines anything else released. This is one of those movies. 12 Years A Slave is in a different class from any other films I have seen in a very long time. The storytelling is rich in characterisation and emotion, and once again, Steve McQueen pushes the viewer (and cast) beyond their comfort zones. But it is with such great directorial skill, he compels us to watch even the most brutal of sequences. People find it hard to watch, and some find it impossible to watch, but I challenge you to watch it without becoming emotionally attached and to ignore the beauty of this modern masterpiece. Once again, McQueen brings out the very best of Michael Fassbender like no other director has yet achieved, and he produces equally performances by all the cast, especially Lupita Nyong'o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano and Paul Giamatti (I could easily go on to name most of them!). But it is Chiwetel Ejiofor who steals your attention and forces you uncomfortably deep into the depths of your seat as he turns in the best performance of his career so far - by far. He is a revelation on screen that makes me want to watch Dirty Pretty Things, Kinky Boots and American Gangster all over again.

","Steve McQueen's '12 Years A Slave' tells the story of accomplished cellist Solomon Northopp who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. The film grabs your attention from the very start, involving you into the nightmare that Ejiofor's Solomon goes through. The viewer feels for Solomon right away but when his fellow victims are introduced, he/she is further horrified seeing how much worse off these people, including a mother and her two children sold off separately and a young woman forced to becoming a sex slave and forced laborer, are than Northopp and that there's no hope for them.<br/><br/>'12 Years a Slave' is craftfully made. There's some fine cinematography and lighting. Music is used efficiently. In my opinion the best scenes are the ones that had no music or dialogue. For example, the scene where poor Solomon is hang to a tree and left there with his toes barely touching the earth. No dialogue, no music but the rawness of that scene and the 'bystanders' getting along with their day-to-day life in the background is brutally effective.<br/><br/>Chiwetel Ejiorfor is sensational and hopefully this film gives him the recognition he deserves. Lupita Ngong'o is equally stunning and raw. Michael Fassbender and Sarah Paulsen are wonderful. Brad Pitt is the weakest link. The actor doesn't impress and his role should have been cut down. Moreover, it doesn't help that hes given preachy dialogue.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little uneven. Some shots just focus too much on faces, for no apparent reasons (nor does this add anything except more running time) and it's rather distracting.

","True history accounts don't necessarily make for good art, especially for the heavy themed ones, as they tend to be too seeded in reality and consistently emphasize contrived emotions that are basically inescapable. the whole premise of the thing is the hint of authenticity and narrative authority. it now seems disingenuous to me to sell a film with such a tagline that says 'based on a true story'.<br/><br/>like most art forms, the value of a film lies in two things: the subject and the style. the subject is the recorded experience, taken independently by itself; it's the motif that drives the narrative. the style is the means by which a subject is presented and explored by the filmmakers. i don't suppose the subject is to be original in any sort, since pretty much everything is a rehash of past human experience. as such, i'm much more interested in the style and form. the thing with 12 Years a Slave is that its form doesn't quite prevail against the problems related to this type of films.<br/><br/>i probably shouldn't care that a moving, oppressive drama is most likely going to sway and affect its audience a great deal. that is not to say that the film is bad. far from it; i thought the film did good in preparing complex characters, and giving them to some of the best actors of today, producing great performances. Steve McQueen's gritty and realistic direction makes sure to keep the intensity going. another thing i admired is that McQueen never tries to make a hero out of Solomon, despite the temptations that can conquer a lesser filmmaker. in the end, i was moved but not totally satisfied; i prefer Hunger and Shame."
"caseymoviemania","7","0","3","3 February 2014"," First-class acting ensemble dominates in this harrowing but slack slavery drama.
","Long before 12 YEARS A SLAVE reaches to our local cinemas (scheduled for release on 26 December 2013), this acclaimed slavery drama has been (almost) universally praised by critics and even garnered a number of accolades from various film festivals when it first landed in the US. Not only that, it has also been positioned as one of the frontrunners for 2014 Oscar. And now, here lies the biggest question: does 12 YEARS A SLAVE really worth such a high praise? Upon finally watching it, I admit the movie was good but hardly the kind of cinematic masterpiece I was hoping for in the first place.<br/><br/>WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/><br/>Based on the 1853 autobiography Twelve Years A Slave by Solomon Northup, Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, a free and well-educated black man who lives with his beloved wife and two children in New York. One day he is enticed by a pair of professional illusionists Brown (Scoot McNairy) and Hamilton (Taran Killam) to travel with them to Washington, DC for a lucrative circus gig. But things goes wrong after he's been drugged by the two illusionists and finds himself awakens being chained to a floor. He is subsequently sold into slavery by a slave trader Freeman (Paul Giamatti), and later finds himself being laboured away by the kind-hearted plantation owner Mr. Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). Northup's life as a slave turns uglier when Mr. Ford sells him to Mr. Epps (Michael Fassbender), a drunken sadist who owns a cotton plantation.<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>As in previous two features, HUNGER (2008) and SHAME (2011), director Steve McQueen applies the same unflinching approach in 12 YEARS A SLAVE with some worthwhile moments here and there that makes you cringe.<br/><br/>However, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is best remembered for its top-notch acting showcase. Chiwetel Ejiofor achieves his career-best as Solomon Northup, who is particularly memorable the way he uses his expressive eyes to convey his varied emotions. This is the kind of performance that I seriously hoped he will lands an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. As the spiteful Mr. Epps, Michael Fassbender is similarly impressive while newcomer Lupita Nyong'o almost steals the show with her heartbreaking performance as the sympathetic slave, Patsey. The rest of the supporting actors, ranging from Benedict Cumberbatch to Brad Pitt, have equally prove their worthy talents here.<br/><br/>MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)<br/><br/>The long uninterrupted take where Northup is seen struggling to stay alive with a noose dangling around his neck, and a painful scene where Patsey ends up being lashed after trying to reason with Mr. Epps over a bar of soap.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF<br/><br/>Despite the agonising subject matter, McQueen's direction is somehow too restrained to fulfill the impact for the horror of slavery. Sometimes the movie feels overly melodramatic and other times the pace slackens a lot, particularly in the climactic finale which could have been trimmed shorter. John Ridley's adapted screenplay, though captivating, is unnecessarily overlong that doesn't justify its 134-minute running time.<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS<br/><br/>While 12 YEARS A SLAVE misses the opportunity for becoming the great movie it aims to be, it remains a worthwhile effort that deserved to be seen at least once.<br/><br/>caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"
"davidgee","7","0","2","2 February 2014"," Brutal and harrowing, but ----
","Steve McQueen spares the audience no detail of the appalling brutality of the plantation owners. Michael Fassbender's flogging of the slave he's been regularly raping (Lupita Nyong'o) is as savage as anything Mel Gibson has put on screen, and Paul Dano's psychopathic overseer is almost more disturbing than Fassbender. Chiwetel Ejiofor's solid performance as Solomon anchors the film, but compared to Spielberg's epic AMISTAD and more recently Tarantino's vivid DJANGO UNCHAINED, there isn't a great deal of story here. At the end we're told what happened to Solomon, but the fate of his fellow slaves, like poor pathetic Patsey, is left for us to conjecture. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a harrowing 19th-century prison drama (OK, a false imprisonment drama) but it doesn't actually add anything to our knowledge of the inhuman evil that was slavery (and still is in parts of the world we're not encouraged to mention)."
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","0","2","29 January 2014"," In its portrayal of violence and spectatorship, it stays in the mind
","12 Years a Slave is a pre-American Civil War film that makes us question how we were capable of treating humanity with such disdain and why little has changed. Hollywood tapped into a number of films exploring African American suffering in 2013 (Lincoln, Fruitvale Station, The Butler), but this particular film's examination of violence and the submissive character reactions has a timeless quality. It could mirror how after September 11 political prisoners were detained without legal rights and physically and mentally abused under the suspicion of not sharing the same political and religious values: such is the film's contemporary relevance and power, which is pertinent and unforgettable.<br/><br/>The director of the film was Steve McQueen, a British filmmaker and visual artist whose last two films Shame and Hunger have been social and politically attuned projects. To confront the subject of slavery in the most brutal uncompromising manner, McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley have drawn from the memoir of Solomon Northup, a New York-born musician kidnapped in 1841 and enslaved for twelve years before being freed. Northup, renamed Platt by a slave trader, is played with unwavering conviction by British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. He excels in expressing Northup's external deterioration, particularly the physical pain he suffers through, while also embodying the conflicted emotions of his powerlessness as others perish around him. Northup is overseen by several different slave masters (played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano and Michael Fassbender) on a cotton plantation. Their justification for slavery is either financial or religious based. Two of them enforce their rule by heinous bullying and intimidation tactics and barbaric physical abuse. <br/><br/>The film's achievement is that by employing a restrained and naturalistic visual aesthetic, the portrayal of violence is authenticated and sidesteps exploitative sentimentality. Beautifully photographed in New Orleans by cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, there are powerful, confronting images, like locked slave facial masks and a severed limb, which are specified but not dwelled upon. Some scenes in this film are so confronting and violent that they would make Django Unchained look like a cartoon. The film though uses this violence purposely as a critique of passivity and the way that people are forced to become submissive in the face of repression. A man tells Northup that ""survival is about keeping your head down"", which means becoming a powerless spectator of one's race. In one powerful moment Northup is strung up and left hanging by his neck from a tree branch. Steve McQueen frames this image from a static wide shot, upholding the scene for an age, so that we see people walking past, unable to help or free him. The scene is an example of how the director uses an image and prolonged shot duration to impose a moral compass onto the story, reflecting the divide between a slave's self-preservation or the risk of selflessness and aiding others. <br/><br/>Another complex and sometimes convoluted layer to the script is the economic factor, where slaves are protected because they become a form of currency and a debt between one master and another. In a terrible scene where Black families are showcased like cattle, based on their strength and health before being sold into slavery, Paul Giamatti makes a brief but immensely powerful impression as a slaver trader, who has no qualms about pulling families apart. It is in his eyes another profitable capitalist venture. The film overlaps capitalism with religious fundamentalism courtesy of Michael Fassbender's awful character Edwin Epps, a preacher who continually misinterprets scripture to suit his own prejudices and evil behaviour. He punishes people when they don't work hard enough but is also fixated on a young black girl named Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) that he sexually assaults by night. His inner life is a surprising but often bizarre power struggle between himself and his jealous white partner (Sarah Paulson). Fassbender's character is played with high intensity and vivid madness, starting with a tight close-up on his red beard, but sometimes I found the character hard to access. Perhaps the contradiction in his behaviour is born from the Christian belief that man has power over animals as his dialogue makes reference to the slaves being comparable to baboons.<br/><br/>Where the film slips is in the pacing but also the geography and location of the characters. As this is set over a decade in time, the characters in the film (like a Brad Pitt cameo) appear and disappear at will. I also found that some of the authentic dialogue, though extremely well written at times with a theatrical ear (""My sentiments extend the length of a coin""), was hard to understand due to the different dialects and accents. These quibbles are noticeable because it is such a brave and moving film and at times impeccably detailed. I'm not sure it's the masterpiece some are saying it is, but in its portrayal of violence and spectatorship, it stays in the mind. Its brutality forces us to ask if slavery really has ended as we look at how imprisonment today is still justified by both religious and political rhetoric."

I saw recently other movies about slavery, wrote about Good Morning, Vietnam, so I can not ask something the movie industry across the ocean. When you became so big to whip yourselves like this, to make fun of you and to show on what ground your culture is build? Can we expect in fifty years such movies about the actions in middle and south-east Asia? I think that it is impudence doing so. To make profit showing yourself disgusting.

"johnnymurphy15","7","0","2","27 January 2014"," A glossy veneer, but still undeniably powerful viewing.
","The hype surrounding this film has been colossal to the point were it was difficult to not have very high expectations. When seeing the trailer, I thought it ticked the boxes for 'Oscar Porn' with the rousing score and the subject of slavery in which films like Django Unchained and Lincoln both won Oscars last year. I thought the film was slightly over-hyped as it admittedly had a veneer of Hollywood gloss added into the mix, but it could have been a lot worse. Having said that, there was much to admire about it too.<br/><br/>The story follows Solomon Northup, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is a free man living in Saratoga with his wife and children. He is suddenly kidnapped and sold into slavery. He is first sold to a man named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who is a slave owner, but seems to have a conscience and treats his slaves relatively well. After a serious confrontation with Ford's chief carpenter Tibeats (Paul Dano), a comparatively cruel man who cannot stand Solomons intelligence, Ford decides to sell Solomon to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) for his own safety. Edwin Epps turns out to be inhumane and psychotic possessing a strange and twisted obsession with Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), a female slave who receives much of Epps's cruelty. What Solomon encounters is horrifying to the point were he is almost broken. He has to pretend he is not a learn-ed man and has to never reveal his true identity otherwise he will be killed.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, there is a lot to admire about this film. Firstly, the music. Solomon Northup is a competent fiddle player and is sometimes asked to play under duress by Epps for a bit of entertainment for himself and the slaves. It shows that music acts as a distraction, not only for the slaves, but hiding Epp's own insecurities. We also see many shots of the slaves working in the plantations and how they sing to get through the day. 'Roll Jordan Roll' is a great scene were the slaves get together and sing this song to lift their spirits after the death of a slave during a routine days work. Solomon eventually joins in and sings along emotionally, making this a memorable scene, and a song which stayed in my head. Also, when Paul Dano sings 'Run N****r Run' to the slaves as a means of introduction and how the soundtrack continues over subsequent scenes which shows how the fear perpetuated by this character continues in their daily lives as he watches them.<br/><br/>The acting is also very good by the first rate cast. Chiwetel Ejiofor is admirable as Solomon Northup. We see the sorrow in his eyes and the changing body language and facial expressions as he endures these awful events. We also see his determination and hope as he stays silent, but constantly looking for any opportunity to tell someone about who he really is. Although the characters played by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano and Michael Fassbender seem like cliché villains, there is no denying how good the performances were especially by Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps. His character is unpredictable. I could never tell when he will fly into a bout of psychotic rage. When it happens, it's scary. The best thing about the film for me was Lupita Nyong'o who plays the ill fated Patsey. What she has to endure from Epps is a horrifying and shocking journey. She will win best supporting actress for her courageous performance I think.<br/><br/>The film was very beautifully shot. The surroundings were the slaves live are beautiful. They are constantly surrounded by the beauty of nature which is an intentional thing as Director Steve McQueen is trying to capture the co-existence of natural beauty and brutality. There are some lingering shots, most notably, a long shot of Solomon hanging from a rope. The audience have to endure his suffering as he spends hours staying on his tip toes to slacken the rope. The slaves continue their everyday life in the background as if they are impervious to this sort of brutality. It is a scene which tells the viewer a lot about mans inhumanity to man and the subservience of the slaves, made all the more palpable by the fact that some of the overseers are former field workers.<br/><br/>The film does come with a few flaws. The deception happens too quickly at the beginning of the film that we do not get to know much of his family life. The afore mentioned Hollywood gloss takes away some of the heartfelt honesty I felt it should have portrayed, but it is still undeniably powerful and upsetting. Some scenes are still shocking, especially the treatment of Patsey by both Edwin Epps and his jealous and controlling wife, played with a subtle and menacingly unfeeling demeanour by Sarah Poulson. The passage of time is a problem as it does not seem like he has spent 12 years being a slave. It could have been called '12 Months a slave'. The abolitionist character 'Bass' is noticeably distracting as he is played by Brad Pitt in this small part.<br/><br/>It seemed convenient that Brad Pitt was one of the producers and wanted to cast himself as the hero. <br/><br/>Despite it's flaws, it may still remain as one of the more memorable films of the year. I feel the film was made in a way that was palatable to a wide audience, but still remained shocking and moving to the many that saw it. There are many strong views expressed about the film, some interesting, most very over-the-top. It is best to view it as a unique eyewitness account of a dark time in American History.<br/><br/>See my review at (www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com)."
"herbqedi","8","0","2","27 January 2014"," A Compelling Experience with Excellent Acting
","I found the story compelling and the acting excellent with perhaps two exceptions. Ejiofor and N'yongo both delivered breath-taking and heart- wrenching performances that deserve their many accolades and then some. The supporting work from Woodard, Oduye, Brown, and especially Topsy Chapman who does more with her face, body movements, and singing than anyone else does with dialog also kept the film poignant. Cumberbatch and Dano deserve the credit they have gotten for solid supporting performances of characters with layered dimensions. Brad Pitt also executes well the plum supporting role he gave himself. Berry, Chalk, Giamatti, McConnell, Dilahunt, Evermore, and Dylan all score in the one or two scenes in which they are featured. The cinematography and score are both terrific and give the film vitality to take us through the torturous moments. The costume design also deserved its Oscar nomination. I found McQueen's direction compelling throughout save two scenes I found extraneous just showing weary facial expressions.<br/><br/>Unlike others, I was less than impressed with the performances by Michael Fassbender & Sarah Paulson (an actor whose accolades I've never understood) as Mr. & Mrs. Epps. They seemed jarringly out-of-era to me in all expressions and mannerisms. Owners of large and profitable plantations of that era, even evil ones, would have more of an air of dignity - especially when dealing with the Judge and the Sheriff. Instead, Epps makes no apologies for being rough-hewn, petty, cynical, and bitter in front of the Judge and others. Evil, believing his slaves to be no more human than baboons, sure. Displaying less couth than an overseer with his fellow planters and in front of other whites? Not a chance. His biblical interpretation for his slaves was probably his best scene. But he is just too banal and vulgar ""in public"" in the others. <br/><br/>And you'd have to comb deep and far to find a planter's wife as emaciated and as publicly shrill as Sarah Paulson. Her bearing is just all wrong. I also would have liked to have seen some speculation on what Northrup's family was doing during those 12 years. That may not be covered in the memoir but this is a work of fiction based on a true incident - not a documentary (Why the sudden critics of the excellent MOVIE Captain Phillips could not see that and why they got to wield so much influence, I'll never understand - as good as McQueen's direction is here, Greengrass surpasses it in Phillips). <br/><br/>Anyway, 12 Years a Slave is a worthy enough candidate in its own right. Not perfect but certainly very good, possibly excellent."
"FugitiveAmoeba","8","0","2","27 January 2014"," A visceral film
","Steve McQueen returns with ""12 Years a Slave"" after the masterful ""Shame"" and while it is not as complex a subject matter as the latter, it is just as visceral nonetheless.<br/><br/>The film narrates the harrowing story of Solomon Northup portrayed adeptly by Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Red Belt"") who is kidnapped and forced into slavery. His trials and tribulations of 12 long years as a slave are just about enough to strip a man of all that remains of him to identify himself with the person he was before. Reduced to the lowest form of existence at the behest of scriptures in the name of imaginary deities and inhumanity perhaps only surpassed by likes of Auschwitz, the story deals with one man's struggle to not to give in to despair when a single act of perceived insolence could result in a swift death, or worse still, an unbearable existence.<br/><br/>The film is an all too painful reminder of the darker times that humanity as a species has overcome, but still has many ways to go before we can claim to be truly civilized. Oppression and abject subjugation comes naturally to the powerful, especially when armed with the purported word of a barbaric god and this is truer now than ever.<br/><br/>Steve McQueen's directorial style is bereft of any gimmickry and relies heavily on his actors to bring the characters to life by cutting to long close-up shots. This works thanks to some magnificent performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender, the latter with each performance turning out to be one of the finest actors of our generation. This film is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for those who take the world as it is for granted, and forget what it takes to overcome our intrinsic barbarism to earn our humanity. 8/10"
"bm2759","8","0","2","26 January 2014"," A very memorable tale
","Chiwetel Ejiofor is an actor I've been a fan of for some time now. I first took notice of him in Serenity, then was quite pleased with his performances in Children of Men, Redbelt, and Salt. 12 Years a Slave shows us just how talent his is. Through him we see joy, contentment, fear, horror, hate, anger, reluctance, hopelessness, and gratitude. He will be remembered as one of the greats.<br/><br/>Like many have said this is a very brutally honest depiction of life as a slave. It's truly horrible and Solomon's journey shows us a range of different he encounters. Amongst those who 'own' him we see truly evil people, opportunists, kind-hearted slavers and cruel slavers. Amongst his fellow slaves we see people who are helpful, selfish, indifferent, and traumatised. Through him we experience the worst of human nature and indifference to the suffering of others.<br/><br/>Solomon's ordeal shows us that even as a slave not everyone (but almost) enjoyed treating African slaves as property to do with as they wished, and were barely human. This story serves as a reminder of how far Western civilisation has come today, when compared to the rapid industrialist expansion which caused slavery of Africans to begin. Through this story we're able to see that social justice is of utmost importance"
"l_rawjalaurence","7","0","2","26 January 2014"," No-Holds-Barred Depiction of Slavery's Iniquities
","12 YEARS A SLAVE doesn't pull its punches as far as the depiction of the sufferings of slavery is concerned. There are several harrowing sequences showing the ways in which the white masters exert their authority, especially at Edwin Epps' (Michael Fassbender's) plantation, where slaves and whites look on as Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) is whipped for little or no reason. In Steve McQueen's film, there is no such thing as a 'good' master: although Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) understands Solomon's (Chiwetel Ejofor's) suffering, he feels unable to intervene; as a slave, Solomon is part of a debt that Ford has had to pass on to Epps. The one 'good' white, Bass (Brad Pitt) is not an American, but a Canadian immigrant and therefore 'untainted' by the whites' creed during the antebellum era. The film is not without its questionable elements: one wonders whether a slave would be forced to whip a fellow-slave (most slave-owners had white overseers to undertake that task); and the issue of Solomon's release is perfunctorily handled (Bass delivers a letter which leads to Solomon's release from servitude, despite Epps' justifiable objections. Surely Epps, as the legal owner of Solomon/Platt, would have been able to challenge the decision in court. Nonetheless, it is a vivid dramatization of Northup's 1853 autobiography, reminding us that, even in the post-civil rights era, there are still people doomed to a life of penury with little hope of redress."
"rubenm","7","0","2","26 January 2014"," Intolerable cruelty
","'12 Years a Slave' hits you hard, like a powerful punch in the stomach. Director Steve McQueen shows the atrocities of the southern slave-owners without mercy. He lingers over the humiliations, the whippings, the rapes, the lynchings. There are almost no limits to the cruelty and the sadism shown. <br/><br/>If this wasn't based on a true story, you'd think it was exaggerated. Can a society be so cruel and relentless? Yes, because everything in this film is based on the book by Solomon Northup, an ordinary citizen in 19th century New England, who was abducted and sold as a slave in Louisiana. <br/><br/>The long takes and the explicit display of violence are Steve McQueen's trademarks. Where other directors would turn the camera away and suggest what's happening, McQueen shows it all. The scars, the blood, the pain. This is what made his earlier film 'Hunger' such a remarkable movie. McQueen showed IRA-fighter Bobby Sands' hunger strike in its purest, rawest form. <br/><br/>This approach works just as well to show the cruelty of slavery. McQueen's long takes, his close-ups and his camera angles are great to watch and give this movie an artistic quality that's missing in most Hollywood productions. Also, the soundtrack contributes wonderfully to the terrifying atmosphere of the movie. As do the sound effects in general. When Northup is locked up for the first time, the sound of his chains is almost more harrowing than the sight of his body lying on the floor. <br/><br/>But in spite of its many qualities, this film is essentially a very one-dimensional one. White slave-owners are sadistic (some more so than others), violent and ruthless. This is the message that McQueen keeps on repeating, in increasingly powerful scenes. Even the white women show no pity for the slaves. And the white cotton pickers, who work together with the slaves, are not to be trusted either. This is a typical good guys-bad guys film. There's nothing in between. But that's probably how it was back then."
"The_moan_of_all_moans","7","0","2","19 January 2014"," Another bulging bandwagon.
","When hearing and seeing the reviews for this film flooding in i anxiously awaited it's looming arrival to UK Cinema. I mean the impact it had made on critics was incredible. All sorts of praise; it had to live up to the hype; surely it had to.....even despite the painfully premature proclamation of ""film of the year""; it is only January is it not? Or the pretentious pedestal it had placed itself upon as ""One of the greatest films EVER"". Surely these bold statements had to be backed up.<br/><br/>Well for me it wasn't. And boy was i confused. A film that garnered such acclaim, i mean the Academy Award for (at least)the Best Film Category must already have the title ""12 years a slave"" etched on it. We are in January and already critics have basically flushed all upcoming movies down the toilet as they seemingly have no chance of competing against such a film. Well i'm sorry but i'm not buying it. I get the topic is one that is heartbreaking and no other event in history could have you shaking your head in absolute disbelief, in horror, at what occurred in the past. Some of the scenes are sickening to watch; to think that human beings could do this to another just because of the color of ones skin is despicable, but it happened; and it is films like this that should be spotlighted, should be applauded for bringing such shameful events to light. To educate people on what happened. But it was missing something. And it is hard to criticise a film based on such events, but for me it was slow, there where many scenes that tried to encapsulate emotion, and have someone just stare into the distance for minutes at a time. And a lot of the scenes where repetitive. As the film was based on a factual story i get that the things that happened are mainly through the eyes of Solomon Northup, but i felt like it didn't fully put across how brutal life was as a slave. Yes there where several scenes that showed brutality; volatile brutality, and i truly do not mean to sound narcissistic but i felt there could have been more examples; there was obviously a lot worse that happened. And i felt it held back;again i must repeat i don't say this as someone who would have loved to have seen more abysmal displays of sadism; i say it at as someone who would have liked history to be shown for what it was. <br/><br/>The acting is great by all; real passion involved with the whole cast...well apart from Brad Pitt; he basically took the accent from his role as Lt. Aldo Raine from ""Inglorious Basterds"" and unfortunately stapled it onto his role as Bass. But he's not in it for long thankfully. They really all do well. Only thing that seemed out of sync was that sometimes the acting came across very theatrical, like it where a Shakespeare play. Maybe it was meant to be like that; but it didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>One thing that does bug me however, is the publics acceptance of the film. Now last year with the release of ""Django Unchained"" came a hurricane of unhappiness; people offended by the use of the derogatory and racist dialogue throughout. But now, that a story that is about the same events is based on a true story, I have not heard or seen one disparaging remark on the language that is used in this film. Somehow because it is based on real events it is acceptable to have a film that is full of use of the N word? <br/><br/>That aside, the film for me is not as good as i had been led to believe it was. I think the topic of the film has won more fans than the actual film. I much preferred Django; it may not have been based on real people and had its typical Tarantino-esque madness. But it was also based on the reality of the cruelty of History.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","I sure did get in trouble once. I'm not saying where, but let's just say it was at one of my employments. I entered into a conversation on where people were talking about a certain group of individuals that were oppressed. I casually mentioned that gays have been mistreated and even killed by bigots.<br/><br/>One person, in particular, blew up and I should've predicted the HR call coming a couple of days following. I was not – neither back then nor now – stating African Americans had it worse or the same as gay people.

Well, in today's time, I hear the same thing: People using the Bible as a weapon against humans, specifically the homosexual community.

The originality on the WHITE MAN BAD, SLAVERY/OPPRESSION WORSE genre of film as of late was refreshing and the lead actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor and his character of Solomon Northup was incredibly invigorating. Hell, the movie itself was great, but he and his character alone, is worth watching the whole film.<br/><br/>In probably the most original story of slavery I've seen, 12 Years a Slave tells the ""true"" tale of Northern/free man Solomon Northup who was deceived, kidnapped and sold to the South as a slave for __ years. Now this movie is only 134 minutes long or just past two hours, but I wanted more. I wanted to hear, or read more of this man's plight. (Luckily, this was based on his novel, so I will have to check that out.)<br/><br/>Aside from one clichéd and obvious character – I won't spoil who this was, but let's just say: he's one of the producers, I got a clean prospective on this topic (again: WHITE MAN BAD, SLAVERY/OPPRESSION WORSE) than I've seen in the countless movies of the past couple of years.<br/><br/>Absolutely recommended. This story of this man, this incredibly bright, talented and loving man, should reach your heart, too.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Sorry, Chiwetel. Any other year, I might vote for you to be Best Actor at the Oscars. This year, I vote for Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club, his best performance to date. And this is coming from someone who loved him in the same year's Mud. But you were still great, Chiwetel!"

","There is much to like about McQueens film, an amazingly talented film maker if ever there was one. Some people hated 'Shame', I thought it was amazingly brave and so relevant to the world today. The story of 12 Years a Slave is well known so I won't regurgitate it here or debate the veracity of the truth of the details. I am sure the story is true and almost certainly even worse than we got to see on screen.<br/><br/>The performances are all first rate with the plaudits going to newcomer Lupita Nyong'o who plays another fellow slave in a truly awful position of the subject of desire and torment which she must endure almost daily. Chiwetel Ejiofor anchors the whole piece nicely and Michael Fassbender and Sarah Poulson epitomise total evil as the last white slavers that host our protagonists life. The camera-work is beautiful and haunting at the same time, lingering as it often does on nature and light to set the tone and mood. The films display of brutality that slaves went through in the American South is relentless. This is 'Roots', with all the gore and its totally uncompromising in its delivery. I've heard the critical view that the whites here are too one dimensional. Some are kind slavers, but still slavers none the less, while others are just the worst people alive with Brad Pitts cameo being the only decent person among them. I can't argue with this depiction as unfair, because I am sure its not, the focus is after all on the Cotton Farms which were not a nice place to live and grow up. The film ticks all the boxes and will win lots of awards and I am sure will get rave after rave review. I am something of an connoisseur of the true story drama, I must have over 200 in my DVD collection. I think they're the heart and soul of what makes great cinema, real stories about real people that should tackle real issues and give a real response of emotion form the audience. It is what make films such as these rank as master pieces alongside Star Wars and The Godfather. It should rank as one of my favourites in this genre, up there with Schindlers List, The Murder Of Stephen Lawrence, Wall Of Silence, Hillsborough and so on. So why didn't I like this film? Films such as these are not films you can always enjoy watching, their an experience to digest, sometimes not easily and that's fine I can still digest such a film and say its a good film, and it is, its an outstanding piece of cinema in many respects and its the job of the film maker to challenge, educate, shock and teach us. This film does all of these things. Now I personally didn't learn too much that was new about the American south as I am well educated and while I wasn't familiar with Northup's personal story I was fully aware of what went on and have digested a great deal of other work on this subject. Though I don't live in America I have been there many times and I am acutely aware of the great racial divide that still exists between the communities over there and its primarily because of this great history of slave culture that they have that such division which was never as strong in the UK. While I applaud any film that tackles such a tough subject and seeks to expose it for all it was, I found here that this film felt a little too late. When Mississippi Burning was released in the late 1980's its release was marred by a number of outbursts of violence in cinemas across America. These were caused by reactions to the film, by the reality of the racism in the south of the 60s being exposed for the younger 80s generation, and so this film does the same on a topic that has been covered extensively before but rarely with such gore and brutality. It felt at times to me I was almost watching horror porn but in different genre and while one can rightly say this is realistic and we should see it, I fear for the divide that this will continue to cause among the communities in the USA. A recent visit there has only confirmed for me how little has changed and how little the black and white communities, on the East Coast especially interact with each other and how racial tensions run higher than ever before. I feel certain this film will do nothing but add to those tensions and that is what truly disturbs me more than the film itself. I see no hope offered in the film to bridge our communities and our races in a film of this type and while the film is an amazing work I think the wider implications of it should be considered. There is this great personal story sure, and on that level its an amazing and draining experience but in a wider a context I fear for the reaction it might cause and the attitudes it will only seek to exacerbate. I wish this film had been made at the same time as Cry Freedom, when I feel it was the time to ram these messages home but now it feels like its rammed down my throat and at the wrong time when the world really does need to unite as a people and not divide. This will be a controversial view I know, yes Slavery was bloody awful, people associated with it were evil, I think we all know this already, but just in case you don't here is a film that will really upset about the subject. After viewing it, where will you direct that anger? See it and decide for yourself."
"arranbordi","10","0","2","12 January 2014"," One of the best films I have ever seen.
","There are many, many things I could say to praise this film, here is just a few. Steve McQueen has engineered a masterpiece with moments of pure horror, acted with such conviction the true story comes to life as if you were standing there next to them. There are times where McQueen deliberately prolongs the scenes of daydream to such an extent you truly feel the stories pain. This film is definitely one to watch, I would not be surprised if it won a golden globe for best film. I would also not be surprised if Chiwetel Ejiofor won a golden globe for best actor & Michael Fassbender won a golden globe for best supporting actor. A stellar casting matched with a truly unbelievable story, ultimately resulting in the best film I have ever seen. Well, maybe on par with the Shawshank Redemption & Gladiator"

","Solomon Northup is a free black man from New York until he is kidnapped and sold into slavery. The film follows Solomon's shocking story and what he and other slaves actually went through in the 1800's.<br/><br/>When walking into a noisy packed cinema I was a little concerned about people munching popcorn and intermittent chatter, however for 134 minutes 352 people observed in fascination, shock and terror. <br/><br/>After being disappointed with both American Hustle and Gravity I was really hoping for a film that could live up to the expectation. 12 Years a Slave did not fail in any way. I always new that the acting was going to be great but I can honestly say that I was not expecting every other aspect to be so good. From the beautiful cinematography, to the menacing soundtrack, excellent editing and script, to the stunning yet frightening mise en scene. <br/><br/>Yes the film is shocking but this is a real depiction of a true and harrowing story. Chiwetel Ejiofor is simply brilliant as Solomon but what Steve McQueen does so well, is to get the supporting cast to not only be so convincing yet never upstage or appear to fight for screen time.<br/><br/>In particular Michael Fassbender who plays Edwin Epps is terrifying as Solomons slave master and so convincing that you despise him every time he acts out a scene. Also Lupita Nyong'o who plays a fellow slave is absolutely brilliant in the supporting role. <br/><br/>Overall this film is set to become a classic. It's how films of this genre should be made and must be seen."
"petarmatic","7","0","2","9 January 2014"," Excellent story of pre civil war America!
","What is amazing to me about this film is that it is based on a true story. I guess they had the people during those times who did abduct free black men from the northern states and brought them to the deep South to be resold into slavery. It is probably something that helped start the civil war in 1861.<br/><br/>Story is fantastic, especially because it was based on a true story. I was amazed about that.<br/><br/>Acting is really great and of course who will be the liberator but Brad Pitt, THE MAN! Scenery of DEEP South is also nice, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Does it deserve all those Oscars it will get, I guess it does. After all the President is good nigge* ;) from Harvard. I guess we have to mark his time."
"jeanpaul51","8","0","3","2 January 2014"," One Word To Describe This Movie: Masterpiece
","This Oscar contender (and it shows) is by far one of the best experiences I've had watching a movie even though the experience might of been shocking to say the least it was extremely realistic and thought provoking making you think every step of the way ''what would I have done?'' and it feels as if you were actually in his place seeing all of the things he has seen and you feel this way because of the masterful direction of Steve McQueen but not all the credit can be given to him when surprising appearances by Brad Pitt, Paul Giamatti and Benedict Cumberbatch and the also masterful performances by Michael Fassbender and Chiwetel Ejiofor who should most likely win it at the Oscars for best Supporting Actor and Best Actor."
"flikemedia","10","0","2","2 January 2014"," What a great film!
","So much to praise about this film. <br/><br/>It's not too often you come across a film like this. When a film really makes you sit back and think about how easily everything in life can be taken away from you (and all the people it's happened to), it changes your outlook on life. I don't think I've ever felt despair for a character in a film the way I did for Solomon. <br/><br/>Haven't seen a film this powerful since the first time I watched City of God. Though I would not put the two films in the same category, they both portray an intense image of how cruel a place the world can be. <br/><br/>Great acting, powerful story and superb direction. This movie will stand the test of time."
"jonathan_lh95","8","0","3","14 November 2013"," Brutally honest film which tells a story of slavery from a unique perspective.
","By Jonathan L Hermitt<br/><br/>Another courageous effort made by Steve McQueen and John Ridley as they take the true and painful story of Solomon Northup to the big screen. Hollywood is carefully pulling the curtains aside- revealing the dark anecdotes built by their four fathers but also the western culture as a whole. Finally! More bold moves are being taken in mainstream feature film- and McQueen and Ridley are contributing.<br/><br/>Based on a true story and extracted from the book written by Solomon Northup himself- tells the emotionally harsh tale of a free black man who lives with his wife and children in Saratoga, New York and is deceived, kidnapped and sold as a slave in Washington D.C. There begins to tell and show the suffering, fear, cruelty of the slave trade, the cold, malice actions of the slavers but also the struggle of hope for Solomon's return home.<br/><br/>The honesty of the narrative was so strong it elevated the emotive response and the connection with the characters. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Solomon Northup) offered a riveting and grasping performance in each stage of his development; accompanied by the dramatic irony of the entire story, the audience remains empathetic to his betrayal. Sarah Paulson and Michael Fassbender outstanding work also have to be recognised due to not shying away from their character's persona but furthermore, understanding them- creating a tense ambiance by only entering the scene. <br/><br/>This may appear surprising or outlandish although I think that it could have been more honest in terms of the brutality of the violence. <br/><br/>In such harsh scenes Tarantino would have been well suited. Exploring more into the ""slave-making"" and punishment techniques apart from the cracking of the whip and bat would have truly opened our eyes in the struggle of the Africans. As I feel as a generation we are becoming desensitised by the generic whipping of slaves to a point where we've almost forgetting what these people actually went through and the monumental, ongoing fight to get where we are today. I mention this because the arc of the story felt a little rushed, and missed some substance that one might have received from the actual book.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the only way this film can be described is honest, hurtful but necessary. It tells the story of slavery from different perspective which to some extent is refreshing. I think this film deserves a lot of credit and criticism and it would be anticipated to be an Oscar nominee or winning film."
