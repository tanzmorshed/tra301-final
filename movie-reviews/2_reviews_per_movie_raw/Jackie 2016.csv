"blanche-2","9","66","79","10 March 2017"," what is the problem?
","I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews of this film on IMDb. I would be interested to know how many of them came from people who are too young to remember the Kennedy assassination or much about Mrs. Kennedy.<br/><br/>Okay, several people were angry that John-John in the movie didn't salute the casket.<br/><br/>One review referred to the story as ""horrible and morbid."" Guess what - it is.<br/><br/>One review said Jackie was a ""housewife."" I won't dignify that with a response.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was criticized for doing a ""cringe-worthy"" imitation. Her voice and accent were found hilarious.<br/><br/>And it was called ""boring"" over and over again.<br/><br/>I understand that to each his own, and I respect that. I'm just surprised. <br/><br/>I first of all did not find this film at all boring. I found it emotional, compelling, and interesting - and despite what someone said here, I did find out things I never knew.<br/><br/>I thought Natalie Portman did a brilliant job and, while the role didn't offer as much as Viola Davis' did in Fences, I would not have been upset to see her win another Oscar. There was nothing wrong with her accent, that's how Mrs. Kennedy talked. If you don't believe me, go to youtube and listen to the tapes.<br/><br/>The film focused on Jackie after the assassination, but it was shown, as were earlier times, such as her televised tour of the White House. I thought the film mixed with the actual footage was excellent. <br/><br/>The clothes were perfection. Like others, I did not care for the music and what I really did not care for was the music at the end.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast did an admirable job - John Hurt, Greta Gerwig, and Billy Crudup. I was disappointed in Peter Sarsgaard, but I think he was trying to convey Bobby's shock and grief. He's a good actor normally but not very successful here.<br/><br/>I found this a poignant film and a stunning portrait of Jackie Kennedy and what she suffered as a result of the assassination."
"spencergrande6","8","24","31","24 February 2017"," An exploration of grief, grace and mythmaking
","I mostly fell for this exploration of grief, grace and mythmaking. Even when it was a bit too on the nose (the faults mostly lie in the wraparound story). It's concerned with how someone copes in the spotlight, how someone can make a legacy from the idea of a thing, how a person is more important than their legend but also how their legend shapes how that person is forever perceived.<br/><br/>It's telling in the universe of the film that Jackie herself is first obsessed with redesigning the White House in what is ostensibly a superficial act of decorating, but then is revealed to be, in reality, attempting to reflect more than the legends of past presidents but also the men who shaped them. A reminder that all legends start with a simple human being doing things only a person can do. A grandiloquent gesture of political humanity for a house full of ghosts.<br/><br/>There's a lot else to like here. Natalie Portman's performance does indeed capture Jackie Kennedy's persona, but also the legend of her and the real woman behind it all. Watching the real White House tour video on YouTube showed me how accurate Portman's breathy accent and meticulous demeanor really were. Beautifully composed, with notes of elegance and grotesqueness in equal measure. And a wonderful, tragic, near other-worldly score by Mica Levi."
"shola-35818","5","188","299","21 January 2017"," Disappointed
","As the film is titled 'Jackie' you expect to learn more about her through the film, it should have been called 'JFK's widow one week following his assassination'. This is a woman who was powerful and had a background, a life, buried two babies. All we get from this film is a portrayal of a grieving, often selfish and self absorbed woman who smokes and drinks too much. Who wouldn't fall to that after something as traumatic? The film is flat and bland, it gives us no indication of the type of woman she was, her role in white house (aside from her expensive renovations and insistence on a huge funeral for her husband) We see nothing of her personal achievements. Natalie Portman and the excellent cast's acting skills are the only interesting thing to watch. Disappointing and does 'Jackie O' no justice at all."
"velvetcrowbar91","10","123","194","17 September 2016"," A Stunning, Psychological Portrait of Glamorous Trama
","Throughout the history of cinema, there have been countless biopics of famous figures that deify their subjects and disregard faults in fear of tainting the idol they have so perfectly sculpted. In Jackie, however, Pablo Larrain subverts genre expectations in favor of a haunting psychological portrait of a woman caught in a terrifying piece of history. Famous images of Jacqueline Kennedy in her pink Chanel suit have lingered in the public's collective memory for years, but here, Larrain allows viewers to experience the week following JFK's assassination from the perspective of the woman who held his dying body in her arms. It's shot in an episodic, frantic format that replicates the psychological turmoil of post-traumatic stress as the line between past and present blurs. One ghostly scene in particular - soundtracked by Mica Levi's eerie score - follows Jackie as she wanders the White House in isolation, exploring various rooms and eventually falling asleep alone as a widow for the first time. The film's central performance by Natalie Portman will no doubt gain great attention for its dedication to every last nuance of Jackie Kennedy's mannerisms and voice, but the real success rests in Portman's relentless and layered conveyance of emotion throughout the film. She does not allow the iconic figure to become a one-dimensional reflection of the public's memory, but allows viewers to witness the conflicted feelings of nostalgia, grief, isolation, and tenacity that Kennedy experienced. The film successful solidifies the lingering of Kennedy's melancholic face as a fleeting vision set across the 60s horizon, luminous and bruised at once, but enduring through history."
"Red_Identity","Null","65","99","25 December 2016"," Mesmerizing, dreamlike, and powerful.
","I'm not really familiar with Pablo Larraín's work. I hadn't seen any of his other films prior to watching Jackie. And yet I was still very excited for it because it sounded like something that was absolutely my cup of tea. Hearing reports that Academy members weren't liking it very much, and then hearing exactly why (because it wasn't your usual biopic and seemed to be more ""out there"" than most biopics) just got me more excited. It didn't disappoint at all. It was basically everything I wanted it to be. One of the finest, truest character studies of the year, completely driven by explorations into Jackie Kennedy's psyche. That sounds kind of pretentious, but I do think this film more than any other of the year deserves to be described that way. I would absolutely not be surprised if the Academy doesn't go for this at all, but I do wish it was popping up in more critic awards than it has been. More than any other film of the year it rests completely on its lead actress. Portman is just completely engaging and mesmerizing, and she adds to the film's poetry-like storytelling. Having seen both Portman and Emma Stone, I would be surprised if they gave the Oscar to Stone simply because Portman is basically her entire film and she's also completely immersed into the character in a way that Stone doesn't need to be. The latter's role may just be too light. Regardless, it's a performance to be talked about and remembered. <br/><br/>I appreciate when I leave a film feeling as though there's still so much left to unpack and to uncover about it, meaning that I wasn't able to completely discover all of its aims and goals in one viewing. To me that's the sign of a very well thought out film, a film that will leave a lingering impact. That's exactly how I came out of this. I'm sure not everyone here will take to it, but count me as one of its fans."
"namashi_1","9","14","18","27 January 2017"," Natalie Portman is Mesmerizing in this Stunning Biopic!
","If you ever doubted the credibility of Natalie Portman as a performer, watch 'Jackie' right away & dump your thoughts away. In this stunning biopic, where Portman flexes her acting muscles as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, proves to be a testament of her incredible talent. Its a film driven by a lead performance, that is anchored by sheer power.<br/><br/>'Jackie' Synopsis: Following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy fights through grief and trauma to regain her faith, console her children, and define her husband's historic legacy.<br/><br/>Director Pablo Larraín brings a disturbing true-story on celluloid, that covers theme of love, loss & power. We watch Jackie struggle with the surroundings around her, following the assassination of her President Husband. And I must tell you, the journey has been told with gut-wrenching bleakness. The narrative is no-holds-barred & what we see throughout the film, is a women in deep pain.<br/><br/>Noah Oppenheim's Screenplay is top-notch. Its arresting as well as its disturbing. Pablo Larraín's Direction is fantastic. He has handled this biographical-drama with precision. Cinematography is brilliant. Editing is razor-crisp, keeping the narrative tight in its 99-minutes running-time. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Mica Levi's Score is super.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: As mentioned right from my summary, Portman is Mesmerizing. Its a tour-de-force performance, that ranks amongst the best of 2016. Of the supporting cast, Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy & Greta Gerwig as Nancy Tuckerman, are first-rate, yet again. And John Hurt as Father Richard McSorley, is remarkable in a cameo. Others lend good support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Jackie' is definitely a must see. It finds one of the most talented actresses of our times, at her finest hour. Go watch!"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","5","84","137","4 January 2017"," More of an indulgent fantasy than a biopic
","I've seen many critics and commentators praise Jackie for being an accurate, intelligent, and insightful depiction of Jackie Kennedy and I'm a bit flabbergasted by this. This film came across to me as highly speculative, overly melodramatic, and distant all at the same time. Many of the film's techniques are praiseworthy, but this ultimately doesn't reach the level of a biopic like Patton or Malcolm X.<br/><br/>Jackie follows the life of Jackie Kennedy (played by Natalie Portman) during the days after her husband's assassination. The film's framing device is an interview of Jackie with a journalist (Billy Crudup) at her home after the assassination. She imparts her story to the journalist to set the record straight about her life and her family's legacy. She is extremely controlling during the interview, telling the reporter what he can and can't write about her (even at one point saying she doesn't smoke while smoking a cigarette). The film flashes back and forth between the interview and the days after the assassination, focusing on Jackie's grieving. After showing the initial events after the assassination, Jackie tries to stave off a nervous breakdown while grappling with what her life means without her husband. Without him, she almost feels like her life is a waste. To handle this, she becomes obsessed with building the Camelot myth around the Kennedy family. She wants the Kennedys to be remembered as a grand, romantic family with a good legacy. She accomplishes this in part by planning a grand funeral for her husband against the wishes of the secret service, who desire a more modest ceremony for safety reasons.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that Jackie was instrumental in building the mythology around JFK, and it's not a stretch to believe that she wanted to validate her own life in some way by doing this. Finally, she must have went through some kind of PTSD after the assassination. But the film attempts to show all of these things in ways that are indulgent, exploitative, and melodramatic. Take a scene where Jackie listens to Richard Burton's performance of Camelot while trying on various stylish dresses she had worn in the White House, all while sobbing hysterically. Or a scene where she admits to a priest that she might have planned all of the pomp and circumstance during the funeral to make her feel good about herself. These scenes feel like they came out of a National Enquirer article rather than a decent biography. Just five minutes of research will show that Jackie didn't even plan the funeral – it was planned by Robert Sargent Shriver. This film is all about mood, not accuracy. Needless to say, Jackie's vanity in this film is probably a tad bit exaggerated, and I question the veracity of pretty much every scene in the film. <br/><br/>These flaws may have been somewhat forgivable if I felt like the character Jackie really came to life at any point, but I don't think she did. Using the interview as the framing device was a bit clumsy, and it's one of the many elements that really prevented me from being fully absorbed in the film. While the film is clearly trying to make points about Jackie's character, I feel like I'm being told about them. I don't feel them. But the cold distance between Jackie and the audience is partially because of Natalie Portman's performance. While her performance has been praised left and right, I found it to be overly rehearsed, almost mimicry. In a good biopic, there has to come a moment where the actor becomes the historical figure, and I don't think that happened here. I could say the same for the film's second largest part, Robert Kennedy. Peter Sarsgaard does not look or sound a thing like RFK. <br/><br/>The movie isn't all bad. For all the flak I've given Portman, her performance is good overall, just not as good as her Black Swan performance in my opinion. The director Pablo Larrain uses close ups very effectively (in some of Portman's best moments), and he seamlessly blends archival footage with reenactments. There is a scene where Jackie looks out the window of the limousine at her husband's funeral, and the reflections of the people watching the funeral motorcade on the window looked an awful lot like archival footage to me. Real archival footage or not, it was an impressive effect. The score by Mica Levy is also haunting.<br/><br/>Jackie was a pretty disappointing experience for me. It's more like an exercise in artistic filmmaking than a good story. Ideally you get both from a film. Not so here. I would wait for video if you want to see this film."
"salker12","10","87","144","18 October 2016"," Both Portman and Jackie Beautiful in Subtlety
","I saw this movie at TIFF and haven't been able to get it off my mind since. Natalie Portman is brilliant in her portrayal of someone who is both uniquely strong-minded and painfully insecure. The portrayal of this type of personality at a time (the 2-3 days following JFK's death) where personal and national perception was everything is unlike anything I have seen in film.<br/><br/>Between script, art direction and cinematography, this movie is equally brilliant in its ability to say everything without saying anything. I can't recommend this movie enough. I don't doubt that we will be talking about it come Oscar season."
"zohal1999","7","13","18","28 January 2017"," A simple historical film with great acting by Natalie Portman
","As someone who loves history, I thoroughly enjoyed Jackie. For the most part, the facts were historically accurate as far as I am aware. I also really liked the score, I thought it was very refreshing and simply different. The film was slow-paced but I find that's to be expected with historical films. I liked that the cinematography was simple to give a real sense of the era, and the costume design was great. I also liked the ending. <br/><br/>Essentially this is a film where I liked everything, but didn't love much. The only things that I absolutely loved was Natalie Portman's acting as Jackie Kennedy. She really exuded her character and became Jackie Kennedy. it was great! The other thing I loved was John Hurt as the priest which was a lovely surprise. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a simple film but it wasn't daring. It didn't risk take like other films would and therefore in that regard may be a bore for some."
"Spring15","3","72","126","11 January 2017"," Disappointing and Overrated
","I went to see this movie mainly because I had read rave reviews of Natalie Portman's performance, which according to some, will certainly win her her second Oscar.<br/><br/>I cannot adequately express my disappointment in the movie and in Portman's performance. The first thing that bothered me was the horrible accent she had put on. I don't know if Jackie Kennedy really spoke this way but it felt forced, artificial. She was good at expressing grief, but I was unable to feel any sympathy. This is shocking, considering how devastating the event - JFK assassination- was to the whole country.<br/><br/>In this movie Jackie came across as self centered, which can be forgiven, considering the magnitude of her loss. Natalie Portman couldn't touch me emotionally. The frequent close ups were annoying. We know she was devastated, but it was unnecessary to show closeups if her blood stained face, crying and tears again and again. <br/><br/>The worst part of the movie was the interview which went into the past, in segments, asking how she felt, and Portman's acting in those scenes was way below her ability. Natalie Portman is a good actress, but in thus movie she felt artificial. It was totally unnecessary to create the interviews. If the point of the movie was to show Jackie Kennedy's feelings and courage at the worst time of her life, a more direct approach might have worked better. The screenplay, background score, direction were all deficient in putting life into this tragic story. I couldn't wait for the movie to end.<br/><br/>The saving grace was the costumes and the White House interior at that time. They were wonderful. Acting wise no one other than 'Jackie' had much room. The screenplay certainly didn't help.<br/><br/>The whole movie felt like someone wanted to create a movie that would show Natalie Portman on the screen all the time. Sadly she remained Natalie Portman to me. She never felt like Jackie Kennedy."
"terhitapiainen","4","69","121","10 January 2017"," Surprisingly boring and cold
","We went to the theater expecting interesting but sad biopic of an enigmatic woman. Well... my husband and at least a couple of other men in the theater fell asleep, at least when the noisy and creepy score did not keep them awake. It is difficult to tell what explains the discrepancy of the overall positive reviews and our clearly disappointing experience. We felt that the reason why the story was told was not clear to the writers and director. It is difficult to understand how the movie was so boring when everything you read about the Kennedys is interesting. Natalie Portman really tried to be convincing but the acting was forced and you could smell the hours of training. The accent of Jackie Kennedy was really weird even though it tried to resemble the original way of her talking. I overheard one couple discussing when we walked back to the parking lot:"" It was rather static. - Yes, and psychotic."" I am not sure if they understood the meaning of the words but weirdly it made sense. Overall the photography and costumes were beautiful and all other actors were convincing. In conclusion, the lack of connection with the viewers was evident despite the overall high quality."
"bob-the-movie-man","9","36","62","22 January 2017"," ""And the Oscar goes to... Natalie Portman""
","""Jackie"" tells the story of the spiralling grief, loss and anger of Jackie Kennedy driven by the assassination of JFK in Dallas in November 1963. Hopping backwards and forwards in flashback, the film centres on the first interview given by Jackie (Natalie Portman, ""Black Swan"") to a 'Time' journalist (Billy Crudup, ""Watchmen"", ""Spotlight"").<br/><br/>Through this interview we flashback to see Jackie as the young First Lady engaged in recording a TV special for a tour of the White House: nervous, unsure of herself and with a 'baby girl' voice. This contrasts with her demeanour in the interview which – although subject to emotional outburst and grief – is assured, confident and above all extremely assertive. We live the film through Jackie's eyes as she experiences the arrival in Dallas, the traumatic events of November 22nd in Dealey Plaza, the return home to Washington and the complicated arrangement of the President's funeral.<br/><br/>This is an acting tour de force for Natalie Portman, who is astonishingly emotional as the grief-stricken ex-first lady. She nails this role utterly and completely. Having already won the Golden Globe for an actress in a dramatic role, you would be a foolish man to bet against her not taking the Oscar.<br/><br/>In a key supporting role is Peter Sarsgaard (""The Magnificent Seven"") as Bobby Kennedy (although his lookalike is not one of the best: that accolade I would give to Gaspard Koenig, in an un-speaking role, as the young Ted Kennedy).<br/><br/>Also providing interesting support as Jackie's priest is John Hurt (""Alien"", ""Dr Who"") and, as Jackie's close friend, the artist Bill Walton, is Richard E Grant (""Withnail and I"", who as he grows older is looking more and more like Geoffrey Rush – I was sure it was him!).<br/><br/>Director Pablo Larraín (whose previous work I am not familiar with) automatically assumes that EVERYONE has the background history to understand the narrative without further explanation: perhaps as this happened 54 years ago, this is a bit of a presumption for younger viewers? Naturally for people of my advanced years, these events are as burned into our collective psyches as the images in the Zapruder film.<br/><br/>While the film focuses predominantly, and brilliantly, on Jackie's mental state, the film does gently question (via an outburst from Bobby) as to what JFK actually achieved in his all too short presidency – 'Will he be remembered for resolving the Cuban missile crisis: something he originally created?' rants Bobby. In reality, JFK is remembered in history for this assassination and the lost potential for what he might have done. I would have liked the script to have delved a little bit further into that collective soul-searching.<br/><br/>This is a very sombre movie in tone, from the bleak opening, with a soundtrack of sonorous strings, to the bleak weather-swept scenes at Arlington cemetery. The cinematography (by Stéphane Fontaine, ""Rust and Bone"") cleverly contrasts between the vibrant hues of Jackie's ""Camelot"" to the washed-out blueish tones of the post-assassination events. If you don't feel depressed going into this film, you probably will be coming out! But the journey is a satisfying one nonetheless, and the script by Noah Oppenheim – in a SIGNIFICANT departure from his previous teen-flick screenplays for ""Allegiant"" and ""The Maze Runner"" – is both tight and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Overall, a recommended watch.<br/><br/>Finally, note that for those of a squeamish disposition, there is a very graphic depiction of the assassination from Jackie's point-of-view. but this is not until nearly the end of the film, so you are reasonably safe until then! Also as a final general whinge, could directors PLEASE place an embargo on the logos of more than two production companies coming up at the start of a film? This has about six of them and is farcical, aping the (very amusing) parody in ""Family Guy"" (google ""family guy logos"").<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)"
"seamcg","1","146","284","3 January 2017"," Overrated Oscar Bait
","I've never taken the time to write a review for the site. But this movie... is just too overrated. <br/><br/>The struggle with this movie is based around the character. I am not totally familiar with the actual personality of Jackie Kennedy, but I walked out of the theater absolutely despising her. She acts as if she is in the toughest position in the world, and as if nobody has ever lost a family member before. Consistently, she displays a lack of understanding that others just lost someone they knew as well. I understand that we are supposed to feel compassion for her, but I just do not.<br/><br/>The film is a genuine trudge, with a cacophony of minor chords making up what could be called the ""theme."" The soundtrack is grating, and so is the rest of the movie. The only redeeming qualities of the movie is a very solid performance by Peter Saarsgard, and an appearance by John Hurt. <br/><br/>Portman's performance is genuinely overrated, with small flashes of quality and an overwhelming amount of ""cry face"". <br/><br/>Overall, just not worth the hype, and a trudge through 90 minutes that felt much longer."

Starting like an interview style of a film told by flashback flashback the movie takes place after the death of ""JFK"", as Jackie is interviewed about the experience and the memories of the death and the impact of the administration, all of this brings out sorrow and emotions from Jackie(as Natalie showed the grief and anger on screen so well)it's just like you as the viewer feel the pain of the first lady.

","Admittedly I have never been much of a Natalie Portman fan. That being said, I think it was pretty ballsy of her taking on an American icon, and her work, particularly in trying to get Jackie's ""breathless"" voice, is commendable though NOT Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>Just too many long camera shots - five minutes to watch her from behind walking through rooms of the White House...several times I caught myself yawning. The expressionless face of Billy Crudup as the interviewer - yawn again - and absolutely abysmal minor chords pretending to be a movie musical score, more jarring than anything on screen.<br/><br/>Having just watched The American Experience's terrific RFK documentary a week or so ago, I was struck by why the director would chose a fifty-something, tall, heavy-set actor to play a 34 or 35 year old slim-ish, not very tall Bobby Kennedy - the actor showing almost no emotion at all when Bobby was known to flair up, shout, and when moved, express his emotions.<br/><br/>The reason I give this a 3 instead of a 2 is the lovely performance by John Hurt as the priest. I did not recognize him until the last scene."

","Venice Reports by Alex Immediate reaction to Portman's JACKIE<br/><br/>Alex Deleon {}. Premiere at 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Natalie Portman simply Astonishing as the Grieving First Lady. Viewedon Thursday morning, Venice Day 8, at the massive Aerdrome hangar-like Sala Biennale. Incredible Natalie Portman as Newly widowed wife of JFK is a shoo-in for Best Actress Oscar in Feb. 2017. She had the accent (fey debuttantish speech style during White House tour) absolutely down pat to the point where it was eerie -- but also the supreme dignity and composure after the shooting. All nails hit squarely on the head by Chilean director Pablo Larrain backed up by American Producer Daran Aronofsky. This incredible film gave me the shivers at several points -- Shivers of historical recognition reviving my own reactions to the events at the time. Portman is just unbelievable!! -- She got so deep into Jackie's skin that physical resemblance or lack of it was totally by-passed and rendered irrelevant. She captured the Soul! ~~ After this she stands alone as the Next Big Hollywood Diva. All backup roles also perfect, notably Billy Crudupp as the respectful but in-digging reporter whose interview with Jackie frames the story. A clever scenario device that provides a Kane-ish touch. Ends with the feeling that Ms. Kennedy will do anything to preserve the White House as Camelot legend. This picture preserves the Jacqueline Bouvier-Kennedy legend in spades. <br/><br/>PS: Noah Oppenheim was awarded a Best Scenario Silver Lion on Venice awards night."
"Art Snob","8","49","90","19 September 2016"," One major caveat, but this is an Oscar sure-thing for Natalie Portman
","I saw this at one of my rare non-balcony screenings at this year's TIFF with Chilean director Pablo Larrain (who had another film at the festival, the Spanish language NERUDA) present and available for a post-screening Q & A.<br/><br/>First things first. If you thought Helen Mirren as THE QUEEN, Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf, and Meryl Streep as THE IRON LADY gave great, deservedly Oscar-winning performances in biopics, know that Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy gives a performance here that's every bit in their league. This almost makes you wince at the thought of how much talent was going underutilized in all those Star Wars and Thor movies, but I'm glad that they made it possible for her to play a role like this one. Truly out of the park.<br/><br/>I can't see this film not picking up multiple nominations. Pablo and the picture should both be nominated, but they'll have a tough time taking home the prizes over Damien Chazelle and LA LA LAND (which I also saw and am sure will be a big hit). The cinematography, editing, set design, and ESPECIALLY the makeup are all first-rate and deserving.<br/><br/>There may be a nomination among the supporting players: Peter Sarsgaard is excellent as the thoroughly-broken Bobby Kennedy, and his consideration should benefit from the contrast with his highly-visible role as the head baddie in the remake of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (also seen at TIFF) which is certainly destined for commercial success. (BTW, he's just adequate in that role – no match for Eli Wallach in the original.)<br/><br/>About that caveat: The film leaves the impression that there was a national day of mourning the day of the Kennedy funeral, so I inquired of Larrain (who speaks only limited English) why the film didn't address the controversy about the NFL playing a full schedule on the same day. It turned out that he didn't know what the NFL was and had to be informed by the moderator. I didn't really catch his reply, something about things having to go on.<br/><br/>Another quibble: The framing device is an interview Jackie gave to Theodore White a week after the assassination, but White is not identified and is played by Billy Cruddup, who looks nothing like him. The familiarity Jackie had with him is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>Misimpressions aside, this is a must-see for anyone with a taste for great acting. Let the aforementioned performances be your guide -- that or a desire to see Portman one-up her Oscar turn in BLACK SWAN."

Whether it was the material that defeated him or simply working in English from a script that was never that good in the first place, Pablo Larrain's ""Jackie"" is a classic example of how not to attempt a biopic but then, of course, this isn't really a biopic at all but an account of the Kennedy assassination and the events immediately following it as told to a journalist by Jackie herself.<br/><br/>In the title role Natalie Portman does bear some physical resemblance to her character but she, too, is defeated by the demands of the part; this isn't acting but mimicry and other fine actors follow suit. People who really ought to know better approach their roles as if this were sacred text and as if to compound the miserableness we have to endure a ponderous, yet Oscar-nominated by Mica Levi.

Natalie Portman's acting is absolutely horrible with the worst part being her attempt at trying to sound like or speak like Jacqueline Kennedy. <br/><br/>The cinematography, horrible, again the worst I've seen as it tries to incorporate historical film footage into the movie and also attempts to create black and white film footage or inserted Natalie into historical film footage, looked amateurish.<br/><br/>The soundtrack gave you 1 hour and 40 minutes of depressing boring music as the producer attempts to make a 1 hour movie at best into an hour and 40 minutes.<br/><br/>The script, horrible, any 10 year could have done a better job. <br/><br/>The reporter, that was interviewing Jackie during the movie, tie was too thick for the time period and his shirt collar too big for that time period, how could anyone get that wrong. I fell asleep for 40 minutes of the movie, as I was with my wife and one of her girlfriends or I would have gotten up and left, but woke up and felt as if I hadn't missed anything. <br/><br/>Lastly, how can someone make a movie about this event in America's history and NOT include one of the most enduring and iconic images of all time of little John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his father's casket as it passes by. There is really nothing good to say about this movie, it's horrible."

","I was excited to watch this film given the hype about it and the fact Portman was playing the lead role. but something was missing? story, narrative or context? who knows all I know I was 45 min into this and I was wondering what the hell was going on. I get it, Jackie Kennedy has just lost her husband and the world doesn't seem to give a toss as it puts in a new president to replace him even before she has washed her dead husbands brains out of her hair. they are planning the funeral and all she can do is look for a great place to bury him, some where nice where he will be able to take in the sights at Arlington, news flash Jackie he is dead, I don't think he really cares!. The main problem with this film is the restrained nature of it, is this really how this woman acted after her husband was killed in such a horrific manner? its all to clinical and held together with Vicodin and upper class grace. I understand this movie is touted for Oscar nominations, I understand the nature of Portman's portal of Jackie Kennedy it was amazing given the limitations of what she must have had to work with. I just don't think she had the mindset of Jackie at all, I was not convinced, all I saw was Portman struggling, if this was meant to convey an aspect of Jackie's character then I'm sorry I missed the memo. someone else can love this movie for me it was a part of my life I would like back a long with my $25."
"p-seed-889-188469","1","12","20","19 August 2017"," Stunningly bad
","I feel sorry for the people who made this movie, I really do. I have no doubt their intentions were noble and that they thought, or hoped, they were creating a masterpiece. But alas, it was not to be. It is difficult to imagine that anyone involved in this movie could possibly be happy with the final result for it is not just not a great movie, it is not even a good movie, it is an excruciatingly bad one.<br/><br/>It is difficult to know to know where to start, so let's go straight to the acting. While many reviewers are waxing lyrical about Natalie Portman's portrayal I would disagree. Firstly it is a miscasting of epic proportions. It is forgivable that she is not the perfect physical incarnation of Jackie but it is not forgivable that the casting people chose someone who's physical stature is nowhere near that of her subject. The real Jackie was a whole 4 inches taller than Portman and while most people would call Jackie beautiful I don't think anyone would call her petite. Natalie Portman is petite, elfin even, and it is difficult for a petite person to satisfactorily play someone who has completely different body type. It is not her fault, she is just not physically built that way. Furthermore, look at any photo of Jackie and you will see a person who exudes strength and natural charisma. Natalie Portman never achieves this and how could she possibly do so given that she just does not have that gravitas, once again, not her fault but a fault of casting. Jackie's hair was iconic and integral to her look and image.<br/><br/>While it is unreasonable to expect any actress to have a face that looks like Jackie's it is not unreasonable for a hairdresser or wigmaker to reproduce her hair. So why do we have Natalie Portman in a hairdo that is nothing like Jackie's? While the makers go to extreme lengths to insert NP into historical footage, apparently they can't be bothered to give her the same haircut that Jackie had in the original footage.<br/><br/>And that ""accent"", if that is what it was. When she first opens the door to the reporter, given that here was a lady who looked nothing Jackie, and spoke what seemed to be some sort of Balkan language, I thought that she must be the Hungarian housemaid. Thank goodness for subtitles. If you listen to the real Jackie she spoke nothing like this. While she had a slightly exotic voice she did not have the effected, whiney, barely intelligible voice that Portman gives us. This is important, because the impression it gives of Jackie is she is an annoying, pretentious bimbo who it is impossible to empathise with and who you wish would just go away.<br/><br/>Finally the luckless Natalie is given the most excruciating script I have ever encountered - to call it a second rate soap opera script would be high praise for it. It is a string of clichés connected together with clichés, with more ham than a spam factory. See brave Jackie stride purposely through the mud at Arlington. See brave Jackie comfort her children - ""mummy, when is Daddy coming home"" - I almost laughed out loud at that. See Bobby Kennedy berate himself for not achieving enough. Hear a priest tell us why bad things happen. Hear a reporter praise Jackie. Hear Jackie make witty remarks about General De Gaulle. See Jackie wipe the blood off her face and arrive home alone in Washington from Texas still wearing her bloodstained clothes. Hear Jackie listen to Camelot. Oh lordy, please make it stop, I surrender.<br/><br/>I have no idea what the filmmakers intended. Was this supposed to be a hagiography or a hatchet job? Did they make her appear such a buffoon to bring her place in history down a peg? Or did they actually believe the way they portrayed her would cause anyone to think better of her or venerate her?<br/><br/>Of course neither I, nor most people, have any idea what Jackie was really like. All I know is that the script is such a complete fantasy that nothing in this film can be trusted. It has added absolutely nothing to our knowledge of Jackie and distorted history a bit more. Poor Jackie, I just hope they don't have movie theatres where she is now, she has suffered enough."

Long self indulgent shots. <br/><br/>Pointless ""narrative"". <br/><br/>Perhaps I was just in the wrong place for this film. Or perhaps it was just a very, very, VERY boring film. <br/><br/>That critics like.<br/><br/>Like ""Tree of Life"". {Shudders}<br/><br/>What is it with critics and boring, pretentious films?"
"Turfseer","2","24","46","4 February 2017"," Portman's ""Jackie"" is much more neurotic than poised
","There are few films that I question the necessity of making in the first place. Jackie, a historical drama chronicling our former first lady's practical and emotional reactions to the events leading up to and during the funeral of our 35th president, is one such film. What possibly can be learned about someone's life chronicling the time period leading up to a funeral—an event where any person would be most vulnerable? <br/><br/>Instead of perhaps imagining what kind of relationship Jackie had with Jack Kennedy when he was alive, director Pablo Larrain prefers to bring us pale imitations of historical TV broadcasts (such as Jackie's famed 1962 televised tour of the White House) or the more salacious exploding head of JFK when he's hit by the assassin's bullet (haven't we seen enough of that on Youtube in clip after clip of the Zapruder film?).<br/><br/>Larrain, utilizing a screenplay by Noah Oppenheim, creates a fictional framing device, an imagined interview between Jackie Kennedy and a fictional reporter (played by a somewhat unkempt Billy Crudup) at Hyannisport, asking a slew of inappropriate questions of Jackie regarding her recent recollection as to the the events leading up to JFK's funeral.<br/><br/>Even if one concedes there is a necessity in presenting such a behind the scenes look, there has to be a determined verisimilitude in the presentation. Actors have to look and sound like the historical personages they're playing; otherwise, the events won't seem real at all, and one will get the impression that we're looking at a mere imitation of the events as opposed to the real McCoy.<br/><br/>The number one offender here is of course Natalie Portman, who does fairly well in re-creating Jackie's way of speaking which reminds one of a muted Carol Channing, but is unable to convey any of her poise or gravitas. Instead, she aims to present Jackie as a neurotic, perhaps made more unhinged by the assassination. Mick LaSalle, writing in the SF Chronicle, hits the nail on the head when he writes: ""But no insight can be gleaned or arrived at through a portrayal of Jackie Kennedy as having been a fragile, emotional cripple at the height of her influence and popularity. Once that happens, we're just not talking about the same woman anymore, and all that's left is an actress playing dress-up in a bloodstained pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat.""<br/><br/>Worse than Portman is Peter Sarsgaard as Bobby Kennedy. In perhaps the worst casting choice in a few decades, Sarasgaard doesn't look or sound like Bobby in the least and appears as a strange interloper opposite Portman. John Carroll Lynch as LBJ also doesn't feel like he inhabits the body of our former president but Beth Grant is great as Lady Bird and Caspar Phillipson is decent enough as JFK, during the brief scenes in which he appears.<br/><br/>In addition to the salacious moments of the assassination itself, the Jackie ""plot"" mainly focuses on her indecision as to whether the participants at the funeral should walk with the casket, causing security concerns. There are more effective moments where Jackie must explain JFK's death to Caroline and John Jr., but even those somehow feel intrusive, even after all these years. Speaking of intrusive, director Larrain is determined to inject Mica Levi's overly mournful music into almost scene, reminding us that we're continually in the midst of a funeral.<br/><br/>Only the late John Hurt as a consoling priest to Jackie brings any true gravitas to the overall proceedings. <br/><br/>If you wish to learn about Jackie Kennedy there are many documentaries and features that are way better than this one. Kyle Smith writing in the NY Post perhaps provides the most efficient benediction for this hapless project: ""Jackie"" does more than a disservice — bordering on an insult — to its subject: It's so obtuse about the history of mores that it's the equivalent of showing Abraham Lincoln reading the Gettysburg Address off a teleprompter."""
"ptone-93207","1","21","40","23 April 2017"," Hopefully this is not the future of American cinema
","I've given this my harshest rating yet. One wonders how something like this abomination gets greenlighted. Although the overall concept of focusing on Jackie in the immediate aftermath of the assassination isn't a poor concept in theory (although one wonders what greater understanding of the public would result, or of what value that would actually be), in practice the film fails to convey much more than to purport a great deal of alternating anger and helplessness (but not grief) by JFK's widow.<br/><br/>It uses a device throughout the film, that of showing Jackie's performance in a televised tour of the White House, juxtaposed with those feelings I have mentioned. The intent may be to show that Jackie was just a phony, a hard bitch that chainsmoked and stomped around ranting when she wasn't alone, walking zombielike around the West Wing (but was not so self-absorbed that she didn't completely ignore her children). If this is indeed the intent, it's an especially mean-spirited way of doing it, as we are given only brief glimpses of a living JFK.<br/><br/>But what makes this a truly awful film is the script and the directing. It's difficult to direct from a bad script, of course, but the protracted use of extreme closeups with an accompanying ominous, repetitious, pounding musical score makes the bad dialogue cringeworthy. The most egregious examples of this occur in the scenes with RFK and the priest. The words written for Bobby are particularly unbelievable and out of character, and both Peter Sarsgaard and Natalie Portman deliver their poorly-written lines with the effort one would expect in a film that just represents a payday for everyone involved.<br/><br/>It's unclear if any of the events and conversations depicted are factual; but I have some real suspicions that the film makers just made this stuff up. It's a soulless film that doesn't get or seem to want any emotional investment from the audience, and once it's over with, you just think, why spend all this time and effort on such a dismal project?"

I must admit there were about 3 interesting shots but the only bit that actually grabbed my attention was the very short clip of JFK's head being dismantled. Disappointed because Natalie was amazing in Black Swan and I was hoping for a more interesting take on the story. in conclusion; this is my opinion and I know people have different tastes in films but if you thought this film was amazing you've clearly never seen an above average film in your life."

","I had heard a lot of positive reviews for this film and have always been interested in the Kennedy assassination, had a respect for Jackie Kennedy, and had been a big fan of a majority of the cast including Portman, John Hurt, Peter Sarsgaard, and Billy Crudup. I went into this film with high hopes and left wondering why it was made in the first place.<br/><br/>I hate to question why films are made and I think it's cliché but this is a great example of a film that lacks purpose. I think that a film should have at least some aspect of entertainment value. Whether it's a film that makes you think for days afterwards or it simply provides campy thrills, there should be something that makes you feel differently. <br/><br/>The acting in Jackie is fantastic, as I expected, but it lacks cohesiveness and an overall story. The music is jarring, Jackie Kennedy is not a likable character (surprisingly), and the storyline is not cohesive. I understand that the storyline represents the 'blur' that the days following JFK's assassination were, but it doesn't make the film more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is very good with the exception of her bizarre and unfortunate accent. This is compounded by the fact that she is the main character and speaks throughout the film. Her portrayal makes Jackie Kennedy come off as mean, mercurial, and elitist. I believe that is more the fault of writing than Portman. <br/><br/>Each scene seemed more depressing than the next and the jarring and overly loud soundtrack did not help. I found myself questioning the purpose of many scenes which seemed to contain no dialogue or plot progression. At the end, I found myself wishing that 'Jackie' would have at least ended up to be a heavy-handed 'women's empowerment' film which would have at least given me something to ponder during the walk to my car in the parking lot."

","Film biographies that can be called a masterpiece are rare. Sadly, this is not one of them. <br/><br/>From the first second that I pressed play on the the projector machine at the cinema I am working I could tell this movie was going to be hard to view. <br/><br/>The mood they are trying to pass with the black screen and the series of production logos in silence is that a masterpiece is about to unfold. But there are too many logos involved for a 99 minutes film and it tires the viewer even before the movie has started. Then after some painfully seconds waiting in the dark the music begins. Or at least what you could call music. I can understand they were going for sad music but all they use is the same 2-3 notes for the duration of the film. <br/><br/>And don't get me started on the film's image placement on the screen. First time in my 15 years career that the image of a movie was so out of place. I had to pan it to the left, widen it and raise it up so people could read the subtitltes without leaning left and right. <br/><br/>Now as a viewer I can say what a lot of other people criticize. Firstly: the annoying voice Natalie Portman went with. OK you wanted to sound authentic but since you missed that goal everywhere else at least try to be pleasant on this one. <br/><br/>2nd. The 60's mood comes and goes depending on the scene. 3rd. the documentary inside the biography is so out of place and clearly there just to fill in movie duration and bore viewers more. 4th. Billy Crudup as the journalist couldn't be more emotionless. <br/><br/>All in all while it gets artistic some times its a movie that fails its goal. And the acting of Natalie Portman maybe got her to an Oscar Nominee but sadly its just that. Oscar nominee material and not Oscar material. Living in Greece we regret we actually thought we would have people interested to see this movie. I am sure in cinemas all over the globe outside the U.S. it went as poorly as ours."

"Quinoa1984","10","15","29","18 December 2016"," goes beyond a 'biopic' and into the realm of epic, deeply-felt tragedy
","This may not be directed by Darren Aronofsky, only produced - kudos of course goes to Pablo Larrain - but it has the texture and 16mm feel of one of Aronofsky's low budget, hard-edged and cripplingly emotional gems, and Natalie Portman gives every ounce of EVERYTHING she's learned as an actress and puts it all into this performance. This is like Raging Bull great. You hear the term 'tour de force' bandied about by critics looking to wag themselves off, but this is legitimately one of those. It's also an acutely aware film about politics and perception, that even in the face of one of the massive national tragedies in the US history, it's important to remember what to (or not to) say to the press, to conform to an attire, to show or not show off the kids, and to hide the tears or let go when necessary.<br/><br/>But more than that, this is a completely devastating study of hu,man grief and sudden, nerve-shattering and paralyzing loss, and what to do in the face of that when things have to get done and decisions made; in that sense this makes for the ""biopic"" cousin of this year's Manchester by the Sea, though that's almost doing a disservice to use the 'b' word. The task that Larrain and Aronofsky and Portman have is simple but complex: strip away all of the cultural bark off the tree so we're left with human beings up there on the screen. Again, sounds like it should be obvious, but so many filmmaker pump up their characters full of importance so we can't see what is the real tragedies going on (for a comparison, watch something like 2006's Bobby and then come to this).<br/><br/>It's not that the filmmakers don't point out the importance of Jackie Kennedy Onassis or the Kennedys in general, but actually it's that they do that AND comment on it in a genuinely intelligent way. It's seeing a woman, a mother, a wife, who has seen her husband's brains blasted out right next to her while in a car, having to deal with that which would be one thing (and man what a thing, like the most WTF thing in a lifetime), but then also having to be a figurehead of the WORLD and being in this big cavernous place like the White House (history is often called into question, from Lincoln of course to the presidents killed that people seem to tend to forget like Garfield and McKinley). So Larrain and Oppenheim just make this a person, first and foremost, and Portman shows both Jackie's sharp intelligence, ability to quickly read a situation, with a little shallowness to image, which is not a complaint, it's to her advantage. <br/><br/>So it becomes an intimate, uncomfortable at times (in a good way), deeply felt, sometimes too hard to take, look at what a person, any person, has to do when a loved one is taken away, while there can be little escape from the crushing public image (this often brought into conflict with Bobby Kennedy, a also excellent Peter Sarsgard - he has one of the key scenes questioning what his brother actually *did* that people will remember, ala Lincoln, which, frankly, I sometimes think about myself, that is to say if, I dunno, what if JFK was... overrated perhaps?) This was a shocking and stunning dramatic experience, and the sort of turn from a major star that puts Portman past being a very good, often, terrific, actress and into arguably the major actors of her time. Seeing what she does here is one of the high-points of cinema in a decade - that's how bold this is."
"castingsamparker","3","14","27","5 January 2017"," Tedious Style Over Substance
","There's nothing groundbreaking about using the camera to express the point of view of a character, and using movement and cutting to express the mind state of that character can hardly be considered novel. Occasionally an auteur furthers this idea into a more all-encompassing subjective style, where every filmmaking element pulls the viewer deeper into the psyche of a character.<br/><br/>This more rare movie-jazz sometimes works, as it did in Don Cheadle's staccato Miles Ahead, or in Adam McKay's rapid fire The Big Short, or with amazing fluidity in Iñárritu's Birdman. Sometimes however, it fails spectacularly, as it does is in Pablo Larraín's tedious Jackie. In depicting one of America's most devastating events and reopening one of its least healed wounds, one would think it nearly impossible to not elicit sympathy, but this is exactly where Larraín flops.<br/><br/>While Natalie Portman's portrayal of the dethroned queen of Camelot is convincingly in shock, it never rises to the level of genuine empathy, even in what could've been heartbreaking moments with her children. Instead, Jacquline is forever at arm's length - distant, cold, and calculating. Peter Sarsgaard is disastrously cast as Bobby Kennedy, and he plays the role without a drop of compassion. The film is bookended with an absurdly static and unnecessary interview between Jackie and a journalist, played by Billy Crudup, during which neither could be more opaque.<br/><br/>One gets the feeling that within Noah Oppenheim's script, there may have been an opportunity to make a movie full of heart, but instead Larraín obsessively chooses style over substance, technique over humanity. Jump cuts here, repetition there make me care, he did not."

But it seems that her later performances became frustratingly ""spotty,"" culminating in her shockingly amateurish star turn in ""Star Wars,"" with an equally bad Hayden Christensen. It seemed that Portman did not live up to the early potential of her blazing childhood debut. But in this biopic, she hit a home run with the bases loaded, in the bottom of the ninth. She was flat-out amazing. She didn't merely PLAY the role, she INHABITED IT. Many actors have tackled the role of this enduring American icon—many with a stronger physical similarity—but she owned the part, all of her past work leading to this singular performance. When the Oscars are given out at year's end, look for Portman to be a front runner.

","This must be the umpteenth version of Jacks by now? I think they were full of bravado agreeing to do this yet again. For those of us who are old enough to have lived through it, nothing new here. I have to say that I have difficulty historically dealing with impersonators in general because I tend to become harsher than usual. I'm a stickler for small details. For instance, her hair is incorrect--Jackie had more of it and a lower hairline which gave her a distinctive look. Natalie's hair comes and goes throughout the film as though she either has extensions going on or a wig and then not a wig. Her hairline is so high that she almost looks like she's balding. Then there's the accent--at times it does evoke Jackie but mostly there's a distinctive annoying lisp that Jackie never had. Then there's the miscasting of almost everyone else in the film The only people who 'look' like they might be Kennedys are the actors for JFK and Teddy whom we barely see or hear. Bobby is played by one of those Swedish boys from that huge Scarsgaard family. He too has an unbearable lisp. Jackie was tall for a female of that time; Ms. Portman barely reaches anyone's shoulders. Jacks was famous for wearing low cut heels. Natalie is on stilts and even then she can't outgrow Tucky or Rose Kennedy (who was a shrimp). The clothing looks bought from a Catholic charities shop downtown--work,cheap and completely wrong. The children are pathetically incorrect, no comment (Some producers' kids no doubt?)! A fine Brit actor plays the priest but hardly has a line worth mentioning. Portman gives good grief but adds a snippy , cranky sarcastic edge to everything she says (very unlike ladies who were taught manners from Miss Porters). A 'rush to production' is obvious . It does perhaps show Jackie's complete experience of the time but hardly and unfairly all sides of the woman. Watch documentaries and skip this one."

The camera work is shaky hand held and unprofessional looking. The majority of shots are significantly over zoomed so that you are often looking at part of a human face rather than an entire scene. As if you were standing one inch from the persons nose. Its idiotic. The color spectrum has been compressed to look drab, depressing and unappealing. One has to assume that the director did all this in an attempt to create a realistic and somber mood but instead it comes off looking cheap.

","Perhaps the idea was to make a movie in the style of a funeral cortege, as one long, slow lament. If so, writer Noah Oppenheim and director Pablo Larraín have succeeded. The result, though, is a ponderous, portentous, heavy-handed film, illuminated by Nathalie Portman's star turn as Jackie Kennedy. She is stunning, and is ably supported by Peter Skarsgaard, Billy Crudup, John Hurt and Greta Gerwig, among others. But when a cast like this, with a central performance as good as that, can't prevent the enterprise from sinking under the weight of its pretensions, there's not a lot to be said in mitigation. Mica Levy's Oscar-nominated score is among the casualties: beautiful music, which will sound great on an album I've no doubt, but it doesn't help the film escape its weary slog towards the end credits. Madeline Fontaine's costume designs, which also got an Oscar nod, are fortunately free from the obsequies."
"drednm","1","8","15","15 April 2017"," Music is So Bad, My Dog Fled the Room
","OK, yes, Natalie Portman gives a good performance as Jackie Kennedy. But everything else in this long, boring film is badly done. The worst two examples are the actors playing JFK and RFK. The actor playing JFK is way too short for the role, has his voice dubbed by actual JFK audio footage, and prances around like a gay munchkin. Peter Sarsgaard is a good actor, but make no effort at all to look or sound like RFK. It's as if you're watching a version of history with pod people taking over the roles of these famous men.<br/><br/>From the first awful note, the music of Mica Levi is intrusive, jarring, and totally wrong for this type of film. It even drowns out dialog it's so loud. Aside from the clip of Richard Burton singing ""Camelot,"" the film seems to exist in a time warp, with zero cultural references allowed to intrude other than old news footage.<br/><br/>We are told Jackie is being interviewed in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, but the house and surrounding grounds look nothing like the famous Kennedy compound or Cape Cod. Even footage filmed in Washington, DC looks oddly phony since the city has changed so much since 1963.<br/><br/>The scenes where Jackie spars intellectually with the journalist (Sarsgaard as Theodore H. White, but they never use his name) and the priest (John Hurt) are so foolish they almost seem like comedy skits. There's also a long and needless scene with Richard E. Grant as a designer working with Jackie as she obsesses over interior decoration for the White House.<br/><br/>During the long screen time devoted to recreating Jackie's famous televised tour of the White House in 1961, she talks about the stage that was built in the music room when Pablo Casals played there, but the following scene shows him seated and playing not on a stage.<br/><br/>Other historical characters from the Johnsons to Jack Valenti are glimpsed as being generally unfriendly and outrightly evil, but nothing is developed. It's as if all this history is just a vague backdrop for Jackie to emote in front of. Perhaps it's an accurate comment about a woman who is so self-obsessed, her hours after the assassination are spent worrying about what will become of her and where she will live.<br/><br/>And that's the main issue here. We're shown a Jackie who is constantly self-obsessed rather than self-assured. She's a heroine for the selfie generation rather than a real and accurate product of her time."

","Natalie Portman is a great actress, but this character does not represent her strongest performance. If the goal of the picture was to focus on conflicts between the US establishment and the Kennedy family, then it succeeds. However, the film does not express Jackie in her various roles as mother, sister, benefactor, stylist, designer, and editor. The movie ""Jackie"" mainly explores the tragic moments of JFK's assassination. The movie shows only one side of her behavior in this stressful and shocking situation. The movie was edited in a non-sequential order. The makeup department seemed to do a disservice to Natalie Portman if their purpose was to achieve some semblance to Jackie. Casting was highlighted by the choice of Caspar Phillipson as JFK. The music frames the movie in one long burial process. Granted, much material of the assignation of JFK and the events surrounding the tragedy are sill sealed, but the filmmakers could have used more of the available details to show more aspects of Jackie's character. Example, mentioning Ann Lowe and other underrepresented a key figures related to the Kennedy family in the cinema."
"lavatch","Null","3","4","21 April 2017"," Epic Story Reduced to the Size of a Postage Stamp
","While it was a noble idea to attempt to depict the JFK assassination through the perspective of the widowed First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, the film came up short due to an overly complex layering of timeframes and flashbacks, plus the absence of careful research into assassination of President Kennedy.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" made use of the technique of the interview to recall a range of perspectives on its larger-than-life protagonist. But ""Jackie"" does not rise to the same level in the mundane sequences between Mrs. Kennedy and the historian, who may be a mélange of William Manchester and Theodore White. Their scenes together seemed flat, and the historian never truly drew the subject into his confidence. Even when the historian bids farewell to Mrs. Kennedy after the final interview, they do not even shake hands.<br/><br/>The film was also untidy with historical details, such as a dramatic moment when Mrs. Kennedy tries to enter the autopsy room at Bethesda Navel Hospital. There is no evidence that such a scene occurred. At this moment, Mrs. Kennedy, still in shock, was being sedated and was on a different floor of the hospital with her brother-in-law Robert Kennedy.<br/><br/>For most viewers, the principal interest of the film will be Natalie Portman in the role of Mrs. Kennedy. While there was good feeling in her interpretation of the role, Portman never came close to depicting Mrs. Kennedy's breathy voice. Despite work with a dialect coach, the East Coast accent was not right either. Physically, Portman was far too thin for the role, and she never conveyed the often statuesque carriage of the public Jacqueline Kennedy.<br/><br/>Some of the design work of the filmmakers was admirable, especially the recreation of the interior of the White House and the street scenes in Washington, D.C. during the assassination weekend. Unfortunately, the design values were not enough to compensate for the inability to truly capture history as it was unfolding from November 22-25, 1963.<br/><br/>The most interesting concept entertained by the filmmakers was the dynamic of how Mrs. Kennedy personally shaped history during the assassination weekend. In one of her interviews, she states that history is what is written, and the final discursive appraisal of history may have little bearing on the truth. The film posits that Mrs. Kennedy placed a carefully designed spin on the way that history would remember her husband, his idealized coterie of Camelot, and, above all, her own image. The theme of how history may be transformed into a myth had unlimited potential for exploration in this film. But results were lackluster.<br/><br/>In the ""extra"" track of the DVD version of ""Jackie,"" the director Pablo Larraín explained how he diced up his film footage in the editing room to make a complicated cinematic mosaic. But it was unfortunate that the writer and director of ""Jackie"" did not take an interest in the broader scope of how history was being rewritten in the murder in Dealey Plaza, the Bethesda autopsy, and the machinations that were occurring in the halls of power in Washington, D.C. in the murder of our thirty-fifth president."

There are millions of woman around the world grieving, but this movie deems one of them more important than the rest. Is it justified? Well, the movie certainly didn't lead me to believe so.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman has been nominated for Best Actress in a Lead Role at the Academy Awards. She is the only good thing about this film. She nailed her portrayal and plays all the emotional scenes very well. Had the film been stronger I think she could have been a genuine chance of winning the award. I think she was stronger in her performance than Emma Stone, however the film itself will be seen as significantly weaker, and that will hurt her chances.<br/><br/>The only people I can see getting any enjoyment out of this film are people who have a personal interest in the Kennedy family and the events surrounding that terrible time.

That's about it. <br/><br/>The first thing one notices is the jarring, 70s-thriller musical tones. It's as if they lifted the soundtrack right from ""The Shining"", and it's totally out of place. <br/><br/>With a handful of exceptions, the scenes and dialogue range from banal to bizarre. I think my college roommate's sophomore-year movie had better dialogue. Jackie comes off as completely spaced-out and rather dimwitted, which may of course be accurate. The viewer gets glimpses of things happening in the world (Johnson sworn in; Oswald found and shot; etc.) as Jackie paces back and forth across the White House wringing her hands, having pointless conversations with random third-parties which don't advance the story at all. Much of this is shown to the viewer through strange, drawn-out closeups. Eventually, she spends a good hour of screen time obsessing over the funeral arrangements (seriously?), to the point where I wanted to scream ""MAKE UP YOUR DAMN MIND!!!!!"" at the screen. <br/><br/>Ultimately there is no plot development, no narrative tension, no surprises for the viewer.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","6","11","23 January 2017"," Portman Steals the Show with a Wonderful Performance
","Jackie (2016) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Pablo Larrain directed this fascinating look at the hours, days and weeks in the life of Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) after the assassination of her husband. We see her try to cope with his murder as well as trying to stay strong for the nation as well as comforting her children.<br/><br/>If you're expecting a straight-forward bio-pic then you'll probably be disappointed with this because director Larrain doesn't deliver anything like that. Instead of a straight drama we're given a rather bleak and depressing character study that tries to show how strong Jackie Kennedy was but at the same time show the horrors that she was battling. Not only do we see her wiping her husband's blood off of her face but also her having to plan for a funeral, deal with the political business as well as try to explain to their children why daddy won't be coming home again.<br/><br/>The film is certainly a very well-made one and I want to point that out right from the start. The film bounces around in regards to its story because we go from moments after the assassination to a set-up, which involves Jackie telling her story to a reporter (Billy Crudup). While that segment takes place weeks after the assassination, another side of the story deal with her questioning God to a Priest. The story even takes place before the assassination as she hosts a television show that she takes on a tour throughout the White House. I must admit that the director held everything together quite well but at the same time I think some of the character drama is lost by bouncing around so much.<br/><br/>There's certainly a style going on here and it's even more clear with the loud and sweeping music score. In a lot of ways the film wants to tell its story with the score as well as the interesting cinematography. Again, all of it is extremely well-done but at the same time I think we lose some of the drama from what is going on with Kennedy. As for Portman, clearly she's the reason to watch the movie as she digs into this role and there's not a single second in the film where you feel as if you're watching an actress. Portman really nails this character to the point where you feel as if you're watching the real woman and a woman having to deal with the shock and horror of what has happened. The supporting cast fit their roles quite nicely as well but there's no question that Portman is the jewel.<br/><br/>As well-made as the film is, one can't help but wonder what it would have been like had the director told a more straight version. The film is so well-made that it's hard to really bash the director for how he decided to tell the story but either way, JACKIE is certainly an interesting take on the material and Portman clearly shines."

There is no story, no plot, no intrigue, no new info, nothing to keep you interested. It's scene after one-dimensional scene depicting various pre and post assassination snapshots. Well-done snapshots but it gets old quick. Natalie Portman is excellent. But it's not enough to save this movie. It's as though the whole movie is just a platform to show off Portman's acting skills. Still, whether it's Portman's fault or another's, Jackie comes off as too cold and haughty and uncomfortable. Tense and stone-faced. You don't get a sense of her personality. All the other characters are way underdeveloped and seem to exist only so there is someone else in the scene for Portman to talk to. What is very well-done is the recreation of familiar historical scenes, clothing, famous iconic film clips and photos. A big exception is Hyannis Port. The summer home in the movie looks absolutely nothing like the real Hyannis Port Kennedy homes.

Nothing in this movie empowers this poor woman, even her repeated salty remarks to the journalist aren't given respect by him. She is portrayed as vain, boring, predictable. I was expecting a movie that bears her name to show her full complexities, instead it simplifies her. There really isn't a plot, it's extremely straight linear, no falls, no lifts. This whole movie is basically closeups of sad face and crying. Nothing happens that we aren't already aware of, it deals with drawn-out moments before the assassination, the assassination, and the burial. Also, the soundtrack is a minor form of torture.

"asifahsankhan","8","4","7","6 March 2017"," Natalie Portman's show! She is the MAN here (that's right!)
","The murder of JFK has become, to many (not only Americans), a parable of our time. Not as legendary as a Shakespearian tragedy but nevertheless, soaked in conspiracy and oozing with interest and a thing for the internet. His brief tenure in the White House has been scrutinised and dissected like no other, nevertheless, the legacy of this once idolised figure remains largely intact. That legacy and its elaborate construction stems from a number of sources; Pablo Larrain's film focuses its attention on one in particular, Jackie Kennedy. The film follows the beloved first lady through the week following her husband's murder, chronicling her attempt to build a legacy not only for him, but for herself as well.<br/><br/>The biopic (a contentious term when describing the film) uses a well-tested framing device, with an interview between a reporter and Mrs Kennedy serving as the springboard into recounting the events of the past week. The film does falter slightly here, trying too hard to create conflict between the two characters, which appears to be wholly unnecessary. It does however, provide Natalie Portman with the opportunity to add more complexity to her character, playing two roles: the grieving wife and the political spin-doctor.<br/><br/>The flashbacks are told in a non-linear fashion, cutting between events throughout her time in the White House. The choppy and shattered nature of the film helps to capture Jackie Kennedy's psyche; the murder of her husband is juxtaposed with a re-staging of a 1962 White House documentary as this broken woman tries to piece together her legacy whilst in a deep state of mourning. The unique presentation of the film will be what divides cinema-goers, it's lack of cohesion means that at points it becomes episodic in nature and prevents it from offering a broad enough character study. However, for those of us worn-out by conventional biopics, Jackie should be absorbed and lauded as a diamond in the rough.<br/><br/>The film's study of grief is captured with unflattering close-ups of Natalie Portman, shot in grainy 16mm and presented in a tight 1.66 : 1 aspect ratio. Cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine aptly captures the period and the bleakness of the situation. In the interview scenes, the Kennedy home carries a certain clinical quality, shots are overexposed and the home lacks character, mirroring the facade Jackie attempts to create. The stunning work of Fontaine is complimented by an ever- more stunning score by Meca Levi which seeps into your skin and haunts you, creating a surreal atmosphere that perfectly complements the chaotic nature of the film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is astonishing in the lead role, worthy of the many accolades currently being thrown her way. The wispy and delicate voice is just one of the many components of this exquisite portrayal. Portman and Larrain synthesise the suffering, fear and conviction of Jackie Kennedy with single close-ups, capturing everything in such minute detail. The film rests solely on her performance and she delivers in abundance. ""Not another Camelot"" she utters, words that, regardless of their meaning or intention, haunt this ghost story and its audience.<br/><br/>The subject-matter may appear alienating for some, especially younger audiences unfamiliar with the first lady and her work. However, this isn't a character study in as much as an exploration of grief. This theme has the ability to resonate with anyone and everyone. It's an intensely intimate look at death, the heartbreak it causes and the lives it shatters.<br/><br/>'Jackie' is a remarkably interesting film; its broken structure gives it a dreamlike quality drawing you into a world so entwined with myth and conspiracy and holding onto you like a vice. Levi's score will stick with you and Fontaine's beautiful work will captivate you, but its Portman's spectacular portrayal that will haunt you, much like the story itself."
"LloydBayer","10","7","15","28 December 2016"," Jackie is a bone crushing account of grief and Natalie Portman's best lead role ever.
","It takes a few minutes to get used to Natalie Portman mimicking Jacqueline Kennedy's voice, but once you do, it becomes hypnotic like everything else in this film. Starting with those wailing violins followed by unflattering close-up cinematography, Jackie becomes a haunting experience and ultimately a crushing story about grief. <br/><br/>As an English debut from Chilean director Pablo Larraín, Jackie is a revelatory character study on one of the most iconic personalities in US history. Yet until now, little has been made public about Jacqueline Kennedy other than her glamorous demeanor. Detailing the minutes and hours following her husband and President John F Kennedy's assassination, this film dwells deep into the newly widowed First Lady's psyche and it's a mangled mess from the get go. Between anger and anguish, she wants answers even as the transition of power flows from her dead husband to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn in as the new President. This is happening on board Air Force One, just two hours after the assassination in Dallas and on route to Washington DC. This scene would turn out to be one of the most iconic images (by White House photographer Cecil Stoughton) in political history yet one of the most powerful scenes in this film. We see Jackie with blood stains on her iconic pink suit, standing inches away from Johnson with his right arm raised in solemn oath of office. She is in a daze; the world spinning around her; her future intangible; and the traumatic thought that her husband was snuffed out without a legacy to the world. <br/><br/>Bone-deep and harrowing, Jackie has a lot of these mesmerizing moments and right from the opening scene Larraín wastes no time in portraying the devastating aftermath of the assassination. This is seen in two perspectives – hers and a nation in shock, and takes place in time shifts that converge towards the end. From her perspective, the film is told as an interview with an unnamed journalist (Billy Crudup) that reveals her life as the First Lady, her opulent lifestyle at the White House, some background into the Kennedy family history including feisty exchanges with Bobby (Peter Sarsgaard as brother-in-law Robert Kennedy), that fateful day in the motorcade, being elbowed to the sidelines by the new administration, and the obsession with State level funeral preparations to match that of Abraham Lincoln. This is another fascinating part of the biopic that screenwriter Noah Oppenheim gets right – the strange coincidences linking slain Presidents John and Abraham, and even First Ladies Mary Todd and Jacqueline. <br/><br/>While the interview itself is meant to be an exposé on who Jacqueline Kennedy was, it is also a revelation on how she wanted the world to remember her and her world often referred to as 'Camelot'. It is everything that was perfect to her and although she would reveal to a priest (John Hurt) that her husband was no saint, it was still a fairytale she could not let go of, not even when her children asked her about their father's death, not even when she loses her composure behind closed doors. These sequences are as dream-like for Jackie as it us for us, moving in and out of reality, back and forth between the interview and a fairytale gone terribly wrong, until we see her as an individual capable of bearing infinite pain. <br/><br/>Driven by meticulous characterization, Portman is unmatched by any other role she has played before. While her role could have easily drowned in melodrama, Portman's grasp is the perfect balance in portraying a woman who has lost everything yet will not relinquish her dignity. With several long shots filling the screen with her face, there was no margin for error either yet cinematographer Stephane Fontaine captures every ounce of her emotional trauma flawlessly. Add to that a gut-wrenching score from Mica Levi (who also created that haunting score for Under the Skin) and era specific aesthetics, Jackie turns out to be a powerfully assembled collage of facts, feelings and fiction. But most of all, it's a version of Jacqueline Kennedy that we have never seen before, and perhaps a version that we were never meant to see."

Sarsgaard is just kinda... there, bringing nothing into the mix but a bland presence that seems so forced and uncomfortable it borders on cringeworthy. Gerwig's character? Pointless and completely out of place.<br/><br/>'Jackie' is not about politics. Nor grief. It's not about the public eye, not about love, not about turmoil.

Her public image and the sights and sounds that surrounded her are indelible for so many Americans – and people all around the world – but how much do we really know about her as a person? How much do we really understand? Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was a very public person, with a very private sensibility, best known for being at the center of one of the most traumatic moments in American history. ""Jackie"" (R, 1:40), directed by Pablo Larrain, written by Noah Oppenheim and starring Oscar-winner Natalie Portman as the title character do their best to help us peak behind the curtain and learn more about the woman behind that famous face.<br/><br/>""Life"" Magazine writer Theodore H. White (Billy Crudup) arrives at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts for his appointment to interview Jackie Kennedy, one of the most famous women in the world. Just one week after her husband's assassination, Mrs. Kennedy, who invited the Pulitzer Prize winner to do this interview, is already very concerned that her husband may be forgotten – or misunderstood by history. White, who is deferential, but firm and professional, finds a woman who is clearly still grieving her horrible loss, but who is also very much in control of herself – and very much in control regarding her husband's legacy – even to the point of editing White's notes during the interview.<br/><br/>While returning periodically to the scenes of the interview, most of Jackie's story is told in flashback scenes of her as First Lady – especially on that fateful day in November of 1963 – and the four days that followed. We get a sense of who she was as First Lady from a look at the filming (no, not taping – not in 1962) of Jackie Kennedy's famous televised tour of the White House, during which she showed and discussed her historic and artistic changes to ""The People's House"", as she calls it, while she receives help and support from her close aide, Nancy Tuckerman (Greta Gerwig). But most of ""Jackie"" revolves around the assassination, its immediate aftermath and the funeral preparations.<br/><br/>In spite of being traumatized by the shooting, Jackie ""keeps it together"" as well as anyone in those circumstances could, cradling her husband's fatally-wounded head in her lap on the way to the hospital and desperately hoping that he might survive, dutifully standing with the new First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson (Beth Grant), beside Vice President Lyndon Johnson (John Carroll Lynch), as he takes the oath of office and becomes President of the United States, and then, after sitting motionless beside her husband's casket during the flight back to Washington, D.C., refusing to change her blood-stained suit before exiting the plane and being photographed by the press, ""so they can see what they did to Jack"".<br/><br/>While caring for her children and making plans for their future, Jackie becomes intimately involved with the planning of her husband's funeral. President Johnson and his new administration, including Special Assistant Jack Valenti (Max Casella), respectfully defer to Jackie's wishes regarding every detail, even when she changes her mind. She uses the funeral of Abraham Lincoln as a template for her plans, including insisting on an open procession through the streets of Washington, in spite of the well-founded security concerns that are raised. Alternately sharing their grief and having stress-fueled clashes, Jackie and her brother-in-law, Robert F. Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) work together on these plans, including choosing JFK's grave site in Arlington National Cemetery. As much as we learn about Jackie from watching her during those four days in November, we gain even more insight into her private thoughts during scenes of a conversation with an elderly priest (John Hurt) at the cemetery.<br/><br/>""Jackie"" is fascinating and compelling, but includes elements which damage its overall quality. The script and direction shed a lot of light on what happened (and might have happened) during the private moments of this very public national nightmare, while painting a very personal portrait of Jackie Kennedy, but the editing harms the film's potential effectiveness. The chronology of events, while not very difficult to follow, simply jumps around too much, and the choices of which bits of archival footage to use and where to use them, distracts from and even contradicts the film's own cinematography. Meanwhile, the score is overwhelming and unnecessarily melodramatic.<br/><br/>The primary strength of this film is Portman, who nails Jackie Kennedy's voice and mannerisms, while infusing her with a complex combination of vulnerability, tenacity and grace under pressure. Some of the other casting is shaky. Two of the major players in this historical drama, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and President Lyndon Johnson, are played by actors who look virtually nothing like the real-life men, and make little attempt to act or even sound like them. Fortunately, strong supporting turns by Casella, Hurt, Gerwig and Richard E. Grant (as chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts) pick up the slack. Overall, ""Jackie"" is a valuable and satisfying addition to the long list of cinematic portrayals of the Kennedy family and their tragic, but resilient history. Movie Fans will likely end this film feeling they know and understand more about the Kennedy assassination, its impact on the country and, most importantly, the woman most affected by it all: Jackie.

Jackie came across in very poor light; sorry to say this, but she appeared to be a complete ditz (if that is a word, but you probably know what I mean). The music was like listening to someone scratching their nails on a blackboard. It was very slow and very depressing. I garnered no enjoyment from any part of the movie. I was always waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. Near the end, I was expecting the funeral to have a resemblance of the real thing, which it didn't. I'm pretty generous with my rating scores, but a 5 out of 10 was the best I could offer for this movie.

"zanecoker15","10","6","14","23 January 2017"," Cataclysmic Elegance
","JACKIE is the story of Jackie Kennedy, the well-known First Lady and husband to President John F. Kennedy. The story follows its title character through the series of days following the assassination of her husband, told mainly through Jackie's own words in an interview with a reporter.<br/><br/>Biopics are churned out every year, and every year, like with any film, there are good ones and there are bad ones. These types of films are difficult to make. They usually beg the questions: Haven't we heard this before? What makes this interesting? Why do we care?<br/><br/>Well, JACKIE is one you should care about. <br/><br/>Pablo Larrain, the director, is able to draw the audience into its inner state of Mrs. Kennedy during a period in her life where everything is falling to pieces. From the murder, the new First Family, the moving, her children, the funeral, and countless other things; Jackie is in turmoil. But Jackie is no ordinary woman, yet she could have been made out to be one in this film. JACKIE might have wound up in the pile of melodramatic, one-beat, and bland biopics we see every Oscar season. And thank God Jackie Kennedy's personality was strong enough to crush that possibility into the ground, even long after her death.<br/><br/>Back to the director: Larrain is capable of emphasizing the tragedy of this woman's life, while also pairing it with her enormous sense of elegance she maintained throughout it. The quiet switch of camera-work from steady to hand-held is an excellent way of showing the different states Jackie is in at the moment. During the interview scenes, the camera is constantly set. It never flows, shakes, or moves; showing how Jackie, in that moment, is determined to maintain her image with this reporter who is set on gaining personal insight or tragic emotion from her, but she refuses to budge; just like the camera. But even when the camera does turn over to the hand-held style, it's held with grace and beauty, capturing the sunlight shining through the hair of a character, or the flow of the black veil covering the face of a grieving widow. One of my favorite moments in the film are the ones of the camera slowly trailing Jackie's back as she walks seemingly nowhere, even if she is in the White House, a graveyard, or a park. This highlights the fact that she does not know where she is going, what she is doing, or what she will do. This is the only life she has known, and it's being taken away; even while it was short, it was what made her Jackie. All of this is told simply through the directing and camera-work of Pablo Lorrain. It's simple, yet powerful; quiet, yet speaks volumes. You might not even notice the change if you weren't looking, which is reminiscent of Jackie herself, who was able to silently slip in and out of the costumes she wore for the people and for herself. The use of camera-work alone in this film is astounding.<br/><br/>While the camera was able to portray the complex personality of Jackie, there would be no point in doing that if the actress playing the title part wasn't up to par as well, and Natalie Portman is. We see slight glimpses on Portman's face that indicate discomfort or annoyance, but in less than a second, she is bright and cheery for the people who love her and her husband. While many may argue BLACK SWAN holds Portman's best performance, she wears the face of confidence yet self-conscious at the same exact moment with such talent in JACKIE that her role as Nina Sayers, who has an abrupt change from meek to malevolent (which is expertly acted as well) rather than a simultaneous coexistence, pales in comparison. A woman like Jackie Kennedy had many shades to her, and Natalie Portman is able to distinguish them better than anyone else could. Her moments of weakness in the interview are effortlessly brushed aside in favor for a composed and hardened demeanor that's intent on continuing her husband's legacy. Natalie shows the battle Jackie is having within herself on whether to break down or to hold the image she so perfectly crafted; and Natalie does this without even saying a word.<br/><br/>And finally, the score. My God, Mica Levi has done it once again. Her score for UNDER THE SKIN is the most unsettling and horrifying pieces of music for a film you might ever hear. But does her score for JACKIE top that? Maybe not, but it still is excellent. Levi stays in the field of eerie and chilling, but in a much more classical and grand sense. Many of the songs start off as if they are about to soar into the heavens with beautiful and sweeping violins and harps; but they soon turn sour and dark. What once was extravagant for a brief moment is now tainted, much like the life Jackie had up until everything crumbled. Levi's score has a beautiful despair to it. It encapsulates the tone of the story and its lead, and that makes for a fantastic score.<br/><br/>The Kennedy's were the closest thing to modern American royalty. And the assassination of JFK led to the fall from grace that is so immaculately shown in JACKIE. The top-notch and nuanced lead performance, powerful directing, and haunting score all combine to depict the exquisite tragedy that Jackie Kennedy endured in 1963. JACKIE never feels sorry for itself, and it never asks its audience to feel sorry for it either; just like Mrs. Kennedy would have wanted it."
"MikeyB1793","8","5","11","24 January 2017"," Mesmerizing
","Natalie Portman is mesmerizing in the role of Jackie. We feel her presence and she encompasses the mystic and the aura of Jacqueline Kennedy. Also the tremendous tragedy of this era – namely the unresolved assassination of a world leader at the apex of world power – is at the forefront of this film. The impact of those bullets on the motorcade is felt throughout this film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman simply overpowers all the scenes she is in. She tosses out zingers – a la Jacqueline Kennedy – that are only noticed after – as in I think she just insulted the interviewer, the state senator...<br/><br/>As an additional caveat - if one is not familiar with this time period –if you are under 30 years of age this film may not affect you emotionally. Also the film somewhat slows towards the ending – I felt the conversations with her priest (Played by William Hurt) to be tedious and overly theological/philosophical sagging the overall impact."

"wilcinema","9","3","6","2 March 2017"," Jackie, or the search for meaning and redemption
","Jackie Kennedy is one of the symbols of the 20th century. Her magical aura has struck many, for decades past, and for many decades to come. Elegant, refined, graceful. This has always been her public persona. But what lies behind that facade? Pablo Larrain's extraordinary English-language debut explores the behind the scenes of what was the aftermath of America's most shocking political event of the century. And it does in a way that involves each and every one of the viewers into a psychological character study that is bound to haunt for days. Larrain's and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim's questions directly delve into our own role in history. What do we want to be remembered for? What kind of image do we want to leave to society? Jackie Kennedy had made her stunning elegance her trade-mark, so much so that she's still regarded as the prime example of it. Yet, like a fatal and hypnotizing witch, she lures many a character into a dark, soul-searching journey. She questions her role as a woman, wife, widow, mother, confessing her trauma and her inner conflicts first to a priest, then to a journalist. It feels like a long psychoanalytical session, where we finally discover the true feelings of a character that, more often than not, history has shown as some sort of front-page drawing. We finally see the soul behind the mannerism, the hurt beneath her voice, the world beyond her eyes.<br/><br/>None of this would be possible without the haunting performance given by Natalie Portman. She completely disappears into her role, giving Jackie an incredibly complex and chilling portrayal. She breathes life into the somewhat doll-like remembrance that we've inherited from history, and at the same time she doesn't lose any of the legendary magic of the original Jackie Kennedy.<br/><br/>In what seems almost like an ode to an age past, where people were still humbled by the mission of serving people and purposely guiding them to a better future, Pablo Larrain puts Jackie the bloody rite of passage, making her an icon for a whole people that lost its innocence overnight, pushing it to come to terms with the stark reality of finiteness, of the breaking of dreams, of a Camelot that only exists for one brief shining moment before it's gone forever."

","""We're just the beautiful people."" Robert Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard)<br/><br/>Although the Kennedys were indeed that, Bobby has caught the spirit of director Pablo Larrain and writer Noah Oppenheim's close-to-perfect biodrama of Jacqueline Kennedy in Jackie, set during the week after her husband's assassination. This evocation of a relatively-recent catastrophe for the American people catches the irony of ""beautiful people"" caught in the cross hairs of a careless and malevolent populace that rebels against too much beauty in the hands of the few.<br/><br/>So finely tuned is this meticulous history that while she smokes during a reporter's (Billy Crudup) interview, she tells him, ""I don't smoke."" The smoke and mirrors of ""Camelot"" are carefully tended to by the former first lady, maybe the first first lady to understand the power of image and the portal, television, for making that legacy immortal.<br/><br/>Jackie is a serious exploration of a widow's grief and her understanding of her role in history, despite any misgivings she has about myths that were already forming about her husband and that she was enhancing by playing a regal role in front of millions, a girl who doesn't like crowds. Mrs. Kennedy presented her world to the world through an early TV trek through the changes she had made in the White House décor. Although her husband disliked the expenditure, she knew the show would be a way of establishing the kingdom she would tend even after his death.<br/><br/>To see Natalie Portman become Jackie with the strange accent and debutante's poise is to see an understated tour de force of acting, worthy of the role for which she has won an Oscar nomination. She remains poised, even right after the murder, not with her seeming self-serving but rather intimations of the immortality she can foster in front of the world.<br/><br/>The film, surprisingly candid with the principals' discussion of Kennedy's meager contributions during his two years' tenure, shows how gradually a woman of exceptional intelligence and beauty can become an historical treasure as she assures her husband of the same legacy."
"lralbright1","10","5","13","31 December 2016"," Moving portrait of grief
","Jackie Kennedy is possibly the most famous first lady to have entered the public consciousness in recent history. Even her name conjures up the image of her pink suit and matching pill box hat. The media's representation of her is fixated on the upper crust side of her; the fashionable woman with the affected accent. Jackie, however, offers a rare glimpse at the woman underneath the myth.<br/><br/>Jackie begins after the events that make up the meat of the story. It's after the assassination, after the burial, that Jackie gets a visit from a reporter (played by Billy Crudup) who wants to interview her about John F. Kennedy's murder. This interview provides Jackie its framework as it crosses back and forth through time.Throughout the interview, Jackie is often seen telling the interviewer dark truths but quickly saying, her bitterness rising after the reveal, ""You can't write that."" Jackie knows that the only hope that her husband has left now is what history will write so she uses words and uses imagery to spin a fairy tale that people will believe.<br/><br/>Though much has been said about Natalie Portman's performance, deservedly so, I think Pablo Larrain's direction is extraordinary here. I haven't seen his prior work, but he is one to keep an eye on. He uses 16mm film to give Jackie a grainy, almost documentary-like look that's coupled with breathtaking hand-held tracking shots for lengthy periods of the film that makes it feel as though the audience is a part of the surrounding chaos.<br/><br/>Jackie, however, wouldn't work at all if it wasn't for Natalie Portman's performance. She is in virtually every frame of the movie, bristling with anger, a few moments of crying all while walking in a haze of grief. To call it, or the film, 'Oscar-bait', is reductive and ridiculous; her performance is undeniably great. Yes, her mannerisms, movements and voice are all near exact but it isn't a performance built on a bag of hollow tricks; it's the very definition of embodiment.<br/><br/>Jackie maybe about a public figure in our recent history but if you strip away the Kennedy myth and name, the movie's beating heart, its very core, is the story of how grief feels and how it's handled. It's tumult seeming to never end, like a hazy bad dream. Jackie captures every moment of that bad dream."
"mharah","6","4","10","3 December 2016"," Creepy, or just detached?
","This film shows a Jackie Kennedy that we did not know. While there is nothing revealed of which we weren't already aware, albeit in fits and starts over the years, assembling it all as ""Jackie"" does is certainly a fresh approach. One must decide if we are watching a dissection or a hit job, for in many ways, it is not flattering. Natalie Portman's acting chops are well displayed. Her portrayal is certainly not a mirror image. She actually looks less like Jackie than many of the actresses who have preceded her. But since many other actors in the film only vaguely resemble their actual characters, a look-alike image was probably not intended. Her voice suggests Jackie's very unique sound and speech pattern, but it is not the same. Again, probably not intended to be. The film's scenario covers the week following the President's assassination with strategic flashbacks interspersed. It is difficult to discern whether the actual dialogue can be confirmed, or if it has simply been re-imagined with some degree of hoped-for accuracy. Director Pablo Larrain is Chilean. Reportedly, he speaks little English. This isn't necessarily a handicap, but it certainly could make for some very unusual choices - Among them: Vice-President Lyndon Johnson was surely not the hapless bystander that he is portrayed here; Attorney General Bobby Kennedy did not defer so eloquently to Jackie (we know that from several sources; they didn't even like each other very much); the Kennedy children couldn't possibly have been so detached from the proceedings. The script may have allowed for that interpretation, but the director would have needed to secure it. And where were the rest of the Kennedy clan? They barely appear in the film, and this is not at all like them. Writer Noah Oppenheim's two previous scripts - Allegiant and The Maze Runner - are nothing like Jackie. It had been on the Hollywood Black List (well-regarded screenplays which can't seem to get a green-light) as early as 2010. Darren Aronofsky, to direct and/or produce, had been attached early on; he is hardly a mainstream choice. Portman herself had been approached as early 2012. (Rachel Weisz, the earlier choice, dropped out when she and Aronofsky split up.) She wouldn't even commit until knowing who would direct. Larrain was chosen even though he didn't like doing bio-pics and had no experience as a women's director, to say nothing about never having directed an American film. Aronofsky stayed on as the producer. The main interiors were shot on a soundstage in Paris. The designers and crew mostly Europeans. In short, Jackie is a non-traditional package -- and it comes off that way. It is beautifully done in exquisite detail. Virtually nothing is out of place. The score, from Mica Levi whose previous film credits are eerie, makes a very intense statement. And it is relentless. As a bio-pic, Jackie is an outlying member of the Jacqueline Kennedy canon. As a mainstream film, it is unsettling... even creepy. It will be interesting to see how the Kennedy partisans receive it. My guess is.. not well."

","""For one brief shining moment there was Camelot."" Jackie Kennedy (Portman) has just lost her husband. When a reporter shows up at her house to interview her he isn't sure what to expect. She begins to relate to him the events after the assassination, how she was feeling and how she planned the funeral. This is a movie I was really looking forward to. I am huge into history and specifically into the Kennedy Assassination events. The only problem with movies about JFK is that they tend to keep repeating themselves without adding all that much to what has already been discussed. There have been three that stand out as being different and actually different. One is JFK, dealing with the court case. Recently, Parkland added a whole new dimension as it focused on the peripheral players and not the assassination itself. This one is added to that list. This movie deals with a subject not covered before. The movie follows Jackie from the time of the shooting through the funeral. How and why she planned it the way she did, and other emotional aspects that I never really thought about. Portman absolutely owns this roll and I am really shocked she didn't win the Oscar. The movie is about an event everyone knows about, but her performance is so perfect that it makes it feel real and more emotional than any other movie I have seen about this subject. There are a few technical aspects I don't think were accurate but that aside this is a movie that I can not recommend more. Overall, Portman is amazing in this movie and this film really adds a rarely discussed aspect about this story. This is not your typical JFK movie. I loved it. I give this an A+."

","For those seeking a warts and all biopic of Jackie Kennedy, Pablo Larrain's Oscar nominated drama Jackie may not be the film you seek but this haunting and unique look at grief, celebrity and a nation defining moment in American history is a film worthy of your attention.<br/><br/>Featuring what is arguable a career best turn by Natalie Portman as the titular one-time first lady, a stunning score by Mica Levi and a noteworthy American debut by Chilean director Larrain, Jackie is a transfixing experience that offers both an intriguing look at the assassination of JFK and the immediate effect it had on both the White House and more importantly Jackie Kennedy's life as we are shown brief glimpses of the couples time in office and Jackie's life as she recounts the fateful day of her husbands death to Billy Crudup's news reporter.<br/><br/>The attention Larrain and his team pay to this time period and detail is impeccable as we follow Jackie along her way through the hallways and rooms of the White House or tragically in the Air Force One bathroom as Jackie cleans her blood splattered face or cradles her dead husband in her arms in the back seat of the presidential motorcade.<br/><br/>Throughout these scenes it's Portman that remains the focus; she's the driving force of the film as Robert merely appears briefly in key moments and Larrain's camera often lingers on his leading lady in close up or for extended periods of time and we as an audience end up feeling like a fly on the wall as Jackie goes about the heartbreaking task of telling her two young children about their dad's passing or plans for JFK's funeral procession.<br/><br/>It's all done and shown in an untypical yet effective manner, we feel Jackie's pain even if it's all very far from the usual Hollywood mode of biopics or similar politically tinged dramas. There are no big outlandish moments for Portman to attention grab and no over-dramatized awards baiting moments, while Larrain refrains from big set-pieces, instead focusing on the smaller scale moments with only a relatively misjudged extended White House tour showcase feeling like an overused plot device in a film that's otherwise plotted out at a neat pace.<br/><br/>A mostly fascinating experience featuring one of 2016's most fully formed central performances, Jackie is a must watch for political aficionado's or those that seek their drama with a healthy dose of intensity as Jackie ends up being a shining of the light on a terrible, yet history making time in the life of one of America's most impressive first ladies.<br/><br/>4 cello recitals out of 5"

Then more is revealed, and finally, late in the movie, we get a good look at her husband's shattered head in her lap.<br/><br/>Trauma. We see her alone, horridly alone, in the living quarters of the White house. The movie, before all else, is one of the most moving depictions of bereavement I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I will acknowledge here that this cinema will, alas, be boring to those unable or not inclined to empathize with her in this passage.<br/><br/>The other theme is recovery, and the beginning of Jackie's emergence as the social icon she became, and the intentional creation of history. She was never unaware of image--her insistence on letting the world see the blood-spattered suit was the first public presentation decision shown. In the following days, Jackie begins more thoughtfully to lay her hands on the levers of media power, to create the historical image of President Kennedy, and herself, and the lost 'Camelot.' Lightly but evocatively, the movie raises the question of the relation of history and truth, making clear they are not the same thing, any more than the dozens of Jackie-look mannequins suddenly appearing in store windows were a representation of her as a real person.<br/><br/>An afterward--it is clear that distribution of this movie was strangled in December 2016. There was apparently a non-public struggle over this--much publicity was done in anticipation of a wide release that ultimately never happened. Across 99% of the country, the film got only art-house distribution, and only later, at Oscar-time. I suspect the decision was ultimately made that a film showing a close look at a president being assassinated was not a good thing now."

","It's never a good sign when I am watching a film, that I start checking IMDb to see ""how long is this thing going to last"".  The good news for me is that JACKIE comes in at a tidy 1 hour, 40 minutes and, if you skip the credits, you can escape the theater after about an hour, thirty-five.<br/><br/>And, escape I did, for - apart from Natalie Portman, John Hurt and Greta Gerwig's performances - there is not much else worth mentioning in this film.  And that is too bad for the subject matter - the days from JFK's assassination to his funeral as shown through the eyes of his widow - is intriguing, if only the filmmakers made an intriguing film.<br/><br/>Let's start with what works. Natalie Portman does a terrific job as the haunted, lost Jackie.  She is nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress and she deserves it.  Portman/Jackie is trying to make sense of what just happened, how her ""Camelot"" life has been upended, what does it mean, how does she go on - all the while putting on a good face to a nation that needed her.  She also has to be a comforting mother to her children, who just lost a father.  Jackie spends much of the movie in a fog and Portman's performance of this is interesting and works, for the most part, and I really liked the supporting turns of Greta Gerwig (as Jackie's assistant) and the recently departed John Hurt as a priest Jackie talks to in her time of crisis.  Their scenes with Portman have some sort of spark that could have (should have) jump started this film.<br/><br/>But it's just not enough.<br/><br/>As I mention, Portman - as Jackie - spends much of this film lost in a fog and, unfortunately, Director Pablo Larrain pulls the audience into this fog as well.  It was interesting - maybe even intriguing, at the beginning of the film, but, eventually, I started wondering ""what's the point"" and ""let's get on with it"".  His point, I think, was to have the audience lost in the same fog as Jackie and that might sound like a good idea for a film on paper, but it just didn't work as it was played out over time.<br/><br/>Adding to this is the intrusive score by Mica Levi (UNDER THE SKIN).  The continuous hard punctuation of sound pulling Jackie back from the fog (most of the time) was jarring to me and, after a while, gave me a headache.  Again, I think I get what he is going for, it just was CONSTANT and annoying after awhile.<br/><br/>Which, ultimately, is my complaint with this film.  There is a wealth of avenues to explore with this subject, but focusing on, basically, one thing does not for a good movie make.  It gets redundant and boring and, ultimately, fails as a film.<br/><br/>Go to JACKIE for Portman's (and Gerwig's and Hurt's) strong performances.  Endure the rest.<br/><br/>Letter Grade B- (for the performances)<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","Jackie isn't so much a movie as it is a travelogue of Natalie Portman's face. It's a good face and she looks like Jackie, and Ms Portman is a good actress, but she isn't required to do much here except weep and be sad with a movie camera stuck to her face. The audience isn't really given much more to think about or look at except this ever-present very tight shot of Jackie's face. Strangely given this intimate style of film making, I never felt anything for any of the characters or their problems including Jackie. To say the movie moves along at a very slow pace is not entirely true: I don't think there is any pace to this film other than jump cuts from past to present. Another big problem with the film is that much of the dialogue and conversations would have been very private and unless this script has been exhaustively researched, it all adds up to a pile of fiction and a camera in someone's face. Attempts were made by the writer and director to include sub plots - assassination and what that means for the Kenndedy's as well as America, Communist plots at taking over the government - but they were half hearted attempts at best. Likewise, references to the sensationalist media, expectations of elected officials and their families, life in the public eye, struggles for a legacy, public versus private grief, all these are dropped as quickly as they are raised. Even ""Camelot"" gets only passing reference in the last five minutes of the film as if to throw yet another bit of gravitas into this one note movie. For me, I wonder why this film was even made."

And I think I was right. As I expected, the movie is not something captivating. There's no action, tension or drama. Natalie is great, but even her great acting can't make the movie enough interesting to keep the viewer's attention for a long time. It's also quite monotone. On the other hand, it seemed like it was put a lot of work to make the movie the best it can be. I think the mistake they made is that they only focused on her point of view about Kennedy's death. I mean, a little documentary that is about 30 minutes is enough to tell her story about her husband being murdered. But this movie is about her and they could have shown more aspects of her life and more about her work. Something that's not just connected to the White House. I see the movie much better if they included more about her as a person, an individual, maybe this way people could see her not only as the wife's president but like a talented and intelligent human being that had creative mind and showed people more than they had expected."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>First, let me qualify my review title. The MOVIE as a whole was ""Just Okay"" - but I felt that Natalie Portman's portrayal of Jackie Kennedy was outstanding. The thing I did really like about this movie was that it stayed true to it's theme ... that of looking through Jackie's eyes, and not another conspiracy theory.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a journalist arriving to interview Jackie one week after JFK's assassination. The story is presented in flashbacks as she tells her story to the journalist - the hours leading up to her husband's death, the hours afterwards, the decisions she had to make concerning her children, the funeral and what direction she would have to take once leaving the White House (which she had spent so much time and effort in renovating). How important it was to her that his legacy as the President was left in tact and how that the ""Camelot"" they enjoyed for the short time they were there would never come to be again.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman has come a long way. She was cast perfectly here as the grieving First Lady, convincing in her look, style and mannerisms. And yet, as fine a performance as this was, the movie still fell a little flat with me. It does a good job in its history aspects, but wasn't really very entertaining. I know this sounds like a contradiction in terms - but as I was watching it, I wondered if I would ever watch it again and I decided that, No, I probably wouldn't. As good as it was, I still felt like it could've been better. Don't ask me how, because I don't really know what they could've done to make it any better.<br/><br/>I'm a little bit split here between the acting and the final product. I am giving it 6 stars with a recommend to watch it for the performance of Natalie Portman and a visit back to Jackie's time and the history of her part in this tragedy. I cannot, however, say that this is a memorable film, or re-watchable - even though it was well made."

","Jackie was not a film I wanted to see but gave in to the curiously of what they might do with it.

I'm sure there's much speculation involved in certain elements of this telling of Jackie Kennedy's confused state of mind during this terrible time in her life and our modern history. Direction, cinematography, and music, combine with impressive performances to bring to life this challenging project. In family matters I'm sure Jackie suffered much more than this script ventures to reveal - through her husband's shameless sexual exploits (only hinted at here) but grief for her children at being deprived of their famous father at such a young age must have added heavily to her own. <br/><br/>I could well imagine that some of the behind the scenes actions within the Whitehouse at this crucial time might be rather accurate, in both the positive and negative departments.

Jackie was portrayed as a rather vain, course, and defensive person who smokes and drinks a lot, all of which could be due to the recent circumstances in her life. Portman's performance was also interesting in that she didn't treat the role with awe and gave it to us straight, which I appreciate. I actually really enjoyed the score quite a bit, but didn't think it was a great match for this specific project. Like I said, it was interesting but as a whole a little disappointing. This is the part in a film review of this type where I would usually mention that only if you're a big Jackie fan should you take the time to see this film. However, I will change that to read that if you're a real Jackie fan you probably shouldn't see this film because it does not portray her in the elevated, glamorous light so many want to think of her in, and you will likely be disappointed.

I'm not sure that an in depth knowledge of JFKs assassination is essential here, but it probably wouldn't hurt, as this is looking very much at the aftermath and as the title suggests, this is Jackie Onassis' story, with Natalie Portman representing her very well. She's hurt, aggressive, defiant, all at odds with the character shown before the events in Dallas and certainly how she's depicted to the public. Mica Levi's score is sombre and powerful, it's thick and haunting almost dragging some scenes along in its wake. These two elements make this a very heavy 90 minutes. Not much needs to be said of the motorcade, but needless to say that the way it's dealt with here is visceral. She's bitter and rightly so, there are some heart wrenching scenes that punch through all the formality, but I'm left with admiration for how she coped and to Pablo LarraÃ­n for this retelling. It's honest, addressing her husbands flaws, her fears, but always with an air of feeling wronged and a building tension to want to pick a fight. There's nothing of conspiracy theories or anything to make sense of events. There's no light, no let up in the hopelessness. Still despite all this, it's compelling viewing."

Jackie replied that she wanted to show them her pain to let them know what ""they"" had done. LBJ then opened the borders, gave civil rights to drug dealers, split up families with welfare incentives and pushed every agenda the communists had. He was all in.

","Based on the life of Jacqueline Kennedy (played by Natalie Portman), this film portrays her response after the 1963 assassination of her husband John via an interview for Life magazine and flashbacks.<br/><br/>The movie's first half is superb. The re-enactment of the most remembered moments during that period are chilling and even frightening in their authenticity. Portman (who is consistently solid throughout the film) is moving during an emotional outburst during the interview.<br/><br/>The second half is still good though less strong than the first. There are too many timelines happening simultaneously. While this is never confusing, this approach prevents the viewer from getting emotionally involved in what is happening. As soon as things build up, we are switched to another timeline. Among the more moving scenes in this half are those where Kennedy expresses a loss in faith with her priest.<br/><br/>While Portman is always riveting as the main character (she even impersonates Kennedy's voice), the film spends too much time on her and her alone. A little more exposure of other characters might have added some necessary variety. One such character is Rose Kennedy, JFK's mother. At the time of the tragedy, Rose would have been experiencing the enormous grief of outliving a child for the third time (she would experience it again five years later). In ""Jackie"", she is seen only briefly as a mother-in-law with conflicting views of John's burial. More depth could have been explored here.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Jackie"" has its flaws but they are thankfully outnumbered by its riches. Director Pablo Larrain succeeds in creating a somber mood throughout the film aided by the haunting music of Mica Levi."

The bad thing about biopics nowadays is that they tend to encompass someone's whole biography, whereas this one ceoncentrates merely on the episode during and immediately after JFK's assasination in Dallas.
The portrayal of the Jackie is unique because it evolves into a trifold story of a first lady, a wife and a woman. The director succeeds in giving each one of them enough space, and along the way pulls down a part of the usual glamourous facade exposing Jackie as a character shattered by her trauma, drowning her insecurities in alcohol.

Clearly Jackie Kennedy was an empowering individual and rather admirable. She could've easily snapped and had a complete breakdown, but her classy demeanour exceeded this. She was constantly in control of herself. She had to be, for her children and for herself. With such a powerful and emotive individual, we needed one of the best actresses working today. Yes! Bring in Natalie Portman. Absolutely phenomenal. I haven't seen La La Land at the time of this review, but I honestly doubt Emma Stone was able to better this. Portman became Jackie Kennedy. It wasn't just copying her and mimicking her personality. I wasn't watching Portman, I was watching Kennedy. It's a film that is entirely dependant on that central character, thankfully it works. Fortunately the film's runtime is short and sweet so it rarely drags. There are a few scenes that are perhaps prolonged too much, including the funeral procession itself. For the most part, the pacing is good. Not a big fan of the typical biopic setup of the character being interviewed in order to create the narrative. Slightly uninspired. The supporting cast assisted in boosting Portman's performance. Sarsgaard and the late John Hurt being the standouts. I adored the inclusion of real footage and recordings, made the experience far more authentic. The usage of traditional film cameras also felt vintage, no need for IMAX or anything like that. It's a personal and intimate story that doesn't require advanced technology. One of Portman's best."

","Overrated movie: Jackie (on Amazon Prime). Comparing Portman's tour of the White House to the real thing on YouTube, she's a truly incredible mimic - but not sure her acting skills are really demonstrated here.<br/><br/>I get that the semi-random flicking back and forth between present and past is a deliberate attempt to convey her mental state, but it still feels random.<br/><br/>Disappointing that we learn so little of the woman beyond her entirely understandable state in the immediate aftermath of the assassination. The blood-stained dress was really thrown in your face in scene after scene (we got it the first time, thanks).

","John F. Kennedy was the first president elected in an age where imagine often trumps the reality of experience, ability, and policy. Jacqueline Kennedy likewise was a photogenic First Lady who ingratiated herself with the American public. Their popularity was not universal -- JFK won the presidential election of 1960 by one of the most narrow margins in American history (some believe the winning ballots were purchased with Kennedy money). As president, JFK's approval rating started out one of the highest ever, but by the time of his murder in Dallas had declined to about average for most US presidents. <br/><br/>Predictably, this film tries to portray the Kennedy years in the White House as the mythical ""Camelot"" that Jacqueline compared to it only AFTER the assassination. There are very few scenes depicting Jacqueline with her husband, yet we are supposed to believe there was a close, loving relationship. There is no direct mention of JFK's barely concealed, nearly blatant philandering in the White House with wives of friends, secretaries, and even prostitutes. <br/><br/>The portrayal of Robert Kennedy particularly missed the mark. RFK was the ""bad cop"" to JFK's ""good cop"" and was widely despised. The actor portraying him was far too mellow and soft to accurately reflect the razor-sharp wit and temper of the real RFK. The real RFK was hawkish on Cuba, and was involved in many of the early errant decisions on US involvement in Vietnam. The scene in which he laments over lost opportunities (civil rights, the space program) is particularly misleading since JFK cared or did little for civil rights unless forced by events, and RFK seemingly only championed civil rights later when he was preparing for a run at the presidency himself and it was politically expedient to do so. Neither did JFK see the space program as anything more than a Cold War challenge to Soviet technological prowess.<br/><br/>Finally, Natalie Portman's portrayal as Jacqueline Kennedy unconvincing. The actress was too short (5'3"", about average for women in 1963), while the real Jackie was 5'7"", far above average. The real Jacqueline's height was no doubt part of her dignified, well-poised physical image (much as runway models are chosen for height, among other physical aspects). Portman's makeup and hairstyles vary widely from shot to shot, and often the wigs she wears sit awkwardly and huge atop her small head.<br/><br/>In summary, the film is a thick coating of theatrical paint over a thin substrate of history, portrayed by a cast that fail to evoke the mystique and create the hold that that the real Kennedy clan had upon the American people for decades."
"jrarichards","9","0","0","21 November 2017"," A shocked and appalled widow in a shocked and appalled nation
","First to say what the rather play-like ""Jackie"" from Chilean Director Pablo Larrain IS NOT. It is not the full story of its heroine, whose life extended from 1929 to 1994 and DID continue in some fashion after JFK's death. It is not the story of her husband either - while his death almost entirely dominates the piece, he appears in acted form for just a matter of seconds. This film is not even a retelling of the assassination or the circumstances behind it, though these are, it is true, hinted at.<br/><br/>What we do have here - for a start - is a bit of an explanation of one of the rawest, most shocking and heart-rending real-life sequences ever filmed - you remember that bit where the First Lady, having at first somehow cuddled her husband, then suddenly starts standing up in the open limo and scrabbling about for something on the trunk part of the car (what we in Britain would call the boot)? <br/><br/>For a lengthy first part of the film, Jackie (as played by Natalie Portman) is still covered with her husband's blood, and we see her numbness, anger and embitterment played out step by step in the hours after the assassination, but also in a colder, more contemplative, more calculating, but still angry version, as she is interviewed some time after by a journalist (here played by Billy Crudup). The Crudup-Portman cat-and-mouse interaction in the course of this interview (in part based on a real one) is quite electric, and contrasts with the step-by-step scenes from history in which our star feels abruptly and awkwardly eclipsed by Lyndon and Ladybird Johnson, and tos and fros with the ideas regarding just how stately - or safely dull - the funeral should be. Just how many different emotions must the First Lady have felt at that time? A plethora - and this is made divertingly clear here. <br/><br/>We in fact also see a third version of our lead character, as she appears in a sweeter, more naive version showing TV viewers around the White House when everything was still looking normal and OK.<br/><br/>It is true that Portman produces some kind of near-mimicked version of Jackie, which I know has proved annoying to many, but for me was entirely OK. Indeed a strong performance. A few other actors have interesting/telling parts to play here, and notably Peter Sarsgaard as Bobby Kennedy and John Hurt as the family priest.<br/><br/>So why else to watch this film? <br/><br/>Well, those who want to get a full-life view of Jackie Kennedy Onassis will get nowhere with this work, so this is not the motivation. But for me there is a powerful and genuine reason. As the film makes plain (and all the more so as it lacks the warts-and-all portrayal of JFK that we now know), the assassination, its circumstances and all that came after were a violation of the mandate given to Kennedy by the American people, who never got to see how his full term (conceivably also a second term) would be. They were denied this by a crude, brutal act that created a perhaps-unwarranted legend (Kennedy was elected by 49.7% of the vote on a 62.8% turnout - so nothing special at all). But of course it was utterly wrong, a violation, a breach of the most precious contract between leader and people. And the shock and fear and disgust America rightly felt is what this film has to convey, also through Jackie herself, and that is something worthwhile, something that should forever be recalled.<br/><br/>A new generation should watch to learn of those awful days, those with longer memories should watch to be reminded just how dreadful historical events prone to fading with time actually were."

The expressions and her interactions between other character, again, just feels so real. All the other characters have pretty minor roles since the whole film is based around Jackie Kennedy but the acting from everyone is fantastic. The cinematography/the was it's shot looks beautiful. The scenes where Jackie Kennedy is outside looks great and inside as well. The thing I have to complain about regarding the cinematography is that it got a little bit shaky at times. The costumes/character designs in this movie are fantastic, t looks like they were ripped right out of the early 1960s. No wonder Jackie was nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar) for best costumes and in my opinion they should've won it. The sets in this movie looks absolutely beautiful, especially the ones outside. The ones inside (mainly in the White House) look so elegant and luxurious. The story in this movie isn't a story, its 100% REAL! That's what makes Jackie so great because they history, which is something that isn't all that interesting, AMAZING!

","It's hard to find people who haven't heard about the assassination of JFK. This traumatic event had been shown in so many different ways for so many different reasons ranging from a minor flashback to a historical point in time to a major plot line of movies over the years. Perhaps this assassination of JFK has been more famous than other presidents triumphs in silver screens. But before this I've never seen this event from the viewpoint of the first lady who without any doubt was at the very center of this horrifying experience. To be completely honest I was not at all familiar with Mrs Kennedy prior to this movie. So this was a pretty interesting experience throughout.<br/><br/>The story the director told was undoubtedly a slow one yet it seemed fitting. This was not about the gunshot or the LBJ's getting on the chair. It was about a woman's grief for her husband. It's right not to be flashy or full of twist and turns, the typical excitements.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman did a stellar job portraying the grieving first lady. The trauma Jackie had been through,the contempt she might have felt, her fear of JFK not being remembered as a great leader came out of the screen beautifully through the amazing acting of Portman. The Oscar nomination was well deserved.<br/><br/>The costume, set decoration and the overall sad musical tone was on the spot.<br/><br/>Some might say this is boring and slow but i would say....this is the proper way to tell this sad story on the first place."

","Part of the appeal of watching a biopic about a famous figure is the opportunity to see behind the veneer and into the real life and psychology of that person, and what could be more intriguing than an intimate look into the life of one of the original modern American icons, Jacqueline Kennedy? Director Pablo Larrain and writer Noah Oppenheim's portrait of the First Lady in the immediate aftermath of President John F. Kennedy's assassination presents a rare opportunity to experience a woman known for her grace, beauty and dignity in her most traumatic moment.<br/><br/>""Jackie"" approaches this almost mythic figure in a way that keeps her legend intact Larrain's films exudes artistry and Oppenheim's script paints Jackie as a fierce, dynamic force of a woman, almost to the point that you could be certain there's another layer hidden behind Natalie Portman's stunning portrayal. To some extent ""Jackie"" is frustrating in how clean and crisp it is that it doesn't reach a deeply penetrating level of intimacy, but it's an absolutely striking production in every facet.<br/><br/>The film portrays events as recalled by Jackie to a reporter (Billy Crudup), an imagining of the interview that led to the famous ""LIFE"" magazine piece in which Jackie recalled JFK's love of the musical ""Camelot"" and used it as a metaphor for his presidency. These scenes present Jackie as rather cold and methodical, but the more scenes we see of the hours and days following the assignation enlighten us to the roots of her disposition.<br/><br/>Obviously everything is tied together by Portman's performance. No other actor possesses the intangibles required to become Jackie Kennedy, and it helps that Portman also has the chops to craft a compelling portrayal. Jackie's distinctive way of speaking seems unnatural off Portman's lips, but it's a spot-on impression and the voice doesn't throw the film off balance. She's as fascinating to watch as Jackie was.<br/><br/>The film captures Jackie as whip-smart, devoted to history and preoccupied with her husband's legacy and that of his presidency. Throughout the course of the movie, however, she's a woman in mourning, and it's debatable whether her behavior can be attributed to how she's processing this loss or who she truly was. Nevertheless, Oppenheim's script brings her toughness to the forefront; she always seems to have the clever, pithy, thought- provoking thing to say. He definitely mythologizes her a bit too much with the dialogue, but in doing so he keeps the conversation as stimulating as the costumes and scenery.<br/><br/>Larrain's devotion to costume and setting, in combination with a camera that isn't afraid of cutting all of it out to get a striking close- up, gives the film its elegance yet keeps it from becoming too refined of a depiction. The costumes, the White House décor, the scenes interspersed throughout the film that recreate Kennedy's famous TV tour of the White House create an overwhelming tone of classiness, both echoed and yet torn apart by Mica Levi's moody, strings-heavy score. ""Jackie"" possesses a strong and confident artistic vision with a strong performance as its centerpiece, and that alone makes it a very good film.<br/><br/>Something about ""Jackie"" still feels distant and untouchable, however, which prevents it from growing anywhere beyond the realm of a great artistic success. Moments that could connect on a more emotional level (Jackie dealing with her children John Jr. and Caroline, for example) don't, as if all the behind the scenes moments of the film are also being beautifully staged for us as opposed to feeling messy and vulnerable. We do get some raw, personal moments with Jackie, but her shoes are difficult to walk in – once a legend, always a legend.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","The Kennedy assassination was one of the defining moments of history, probably the most internationally shocking one until 9/11. Pablo Larraín's ""Jackie"" focuses on the widowed Jackie Kennedy during the few days after the assassination, as she tries to cement her late husband's legacy. I wasn't alive then, so I don't know what Jackie's voice sounded like, but Natalie Portman affects a breathy mid-Atlantic accent to play the stylish first lady. Quite an impressive performance.<br/><br/>We could make the argument that JFK didn't have much of a positive legacy, given his poor record on civil rights (upon which Johnson sought to improve) and an undeclared war on Cuba. Even so, the era was seen as the culmination of the possible. I recommend the movie.<br/><br/>Larraín also directed 2012's ""No"", about the TV campaign that led to Augusto Pinochet's defeat in the 1988 election."

","An unsettling and introspective look at the days from when JFK was shot through the funeral and how Jackie Kennedy responded. The film flashes back to the 1961 TV tour of the redecorated White House rising as Camelot and ends with its death. The recreation of the period is excellent and the confusion and indecision portrayed by the jump cutting between rooms in the White House is effective.<br/><br/>In the main, the casting is good. Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy is excellent. She looks enough like Jackie to carry it off. Her scenes in the blood stained pink Chanel suit she wore in Dallas are particularly well done. She has enough of Jackie's accent to convince - though I think she actually lip syncs to the real Jackie for the TV broadcast parts. John Carroll Lynch as President Lyndon B. Johnson is a little portly but he carries off the mannerisms in a minimalist way when needed and the recreation of the hurried swearing in aboard Air Force One is prototypical to the photos of the day. Caspar Phillipson as John F. Kennedy is very convincing. Beth Grant as Lady Bird Johnson is a drop dead 100% perfect look-a-like. A lot less convincing is Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy. He is too tall and doesn't get the Boston accent right which is a shame as he is a pivotal figure alongside Jackie in the movie. John Hurt playing her confessor priest Father McSorley is sublime.<br/><br/>This is not a comfortable film. Going from being ""First Lady"" to an undefined limbo while still inhabiting the White House. It is certainly an interesting examination of how she had to portray her grief and maintain her dignity in a very public spotlight.<br/><br/>Is it a good film? Yes. Oscar material? Probably not.

","This was such a wasted opportunity. Natalie Portman's performance was superb. No one can detract from that, but it needed something more to make this into a film. You kept waiting for it to get started, but it never did. Things just plodded on for the full length of the movie. As Jackie was the centre of the story, only 2 dimensional cyphers seem to have been recruited to pad out the rest of the cast. Many only had first names. So we played 'spot the historical character' as Bob, Bill, Jack, Dave etc were introduced. Some captions for the uninitiated would have been useful. I have studied the period for 30 years and I was confused. What the casual viewer was supposed to make of this I do not know. Also some characters were unnamed, yet played by totally miscast actors. So I'm only guessing that Clint Hill and Godfrey McHugh were who I supposed they were. There was also a coterie of unnamed women, who were completely unrecognisable. They had about one line each. One may have been Eunice Kennedy. Who knows? Attempts were made to reproduce some historical scenes. Such as the LBJ swearing in. But for some reason some details were omitted. Why was Albert Thomas's sly wink to LBJ deleted? It happened. It's clearly in all the photographs. This raises questions about the whole idea of verisimilitude. What do you keep in, and what do you keep out? Perhaps whole people. Poor Edward Kennedy was deleted again. (Just like in the Kennedy's TV series) For most of the film. Until, someone realised he had to be shown marching in the parade with Jackie and Bobby. Then a mute, unintroduced actor was included. Who was never seen again afterwards. Other people, who Jackie had poor relationships with, like Katzenbach and Hoover were also conspicuous by their absence. Lots of dialogue could have resulted by their inclusion. The real people who were included, Bobby and LBJ, were so lacklustre and unlike themselves that it also did a disservice to history. I get it. This was supposed to be all about one woman. The title said as much. But she did not exist in a vacuum. She interacted with strong ego driven people who made history. Surely they should have been shown doing that. The Director was hell bent on showing her as 'alone' so everyone else had had to be downplayed, silenced, or in some cases erased. One surprise was the first ever correct representation of the effects of the bullets on JFK. This has been misrepresented so many times before that I've lost count. So kudos for that."

The assassination only served to give the media an excuse to deify, and cast him in a King Arthur role, and this movie still tries to do the same. Natalie Portman gave a surprisingly good performance, but the ending did a disservice to her portrayal by pandering to a propaganda myth. Is it worth the watch? Yes, if only for seeing Portman pull off the seeming impossible in her portrayal. But unless you like to be preached to, ignore the ending or turn off the video."

","Chilean filmmaker's second feature film—also Hollywood debut—in this same year is ambivalent. Due to his ambitions and wills based on national politics, he has irrevocably consolidated as one of the most sumptuous, subversive and intransigent du jour; an individual inmost influenced by the issues of his unstable country, nation having the time to clean such opacity confined in his past. It isn't a great heroic deed detect why Larraín selected the annals of one of the most conspicuous ladies of the 20th century, having as reference his exclusive insights and previous film, ""Neruda"", work deserving of diverse opinions, which corresponds in the making of its pith with the film concordances such as the right rupture to common narrative skeleton for a biopic,the materialization of a public political personality's chiaroscuro, start from the most excruciating adversity in order to put together a wide real-life report or give a good-condition appearance to global people denoting part of what we are today. Independent of the opportune or extemporaneous, Larraín works with leading characters who set contemporary society origins up in exquisite form, allowing with his works that a vast compilation of filmic constituents reflect bravery, vigor, and authenticity.Authenticity, that's the convincing motive that the movie has, scrutinizing and exposing the frustrated true fairy tale of Jacqueline Lee ""Jackie"" Kennedy Onassis, the First Lady, and also the first widow.<br/><br/>The story has a double-edged sword to concoct cardinal narrative arc throughout the feature film with full complacency, given that it's through American political journalist and historian Theodore White (Billy Crudup) from LIFE magazine that the film gets its main motor to start a glorious infernal and quasi-emulated lineup about what came up before, during and following to the assassination of the 35th President of the United States of America: John F. Kennedy, however, it's appropriate to clarify that the plot isn't deposited in the rhetoric of the contingency, but it emphasizes social, political, sentimental and widely personal trauma falling on the shoulders of his spouse, who faced the mourning, for her beloved deceased husband, wearing a pink tweed in front of the media, while she punished herself for the ruined yearnings and dreams wearing a pristine black dress.Jackie was a first lady who neither did philanthropy, donated exaggerated monetary amounts nor meddled in political affairs of tinsel, she was a traditionalist housewife, who spent her time with the children and the ornamentation of the White House, because of this, the shock generated in her was vastly bigger than each American thought.They say that the more miserable tragedies are which emerge without warning, for this New Yorker the worst tragedy just germinated on November 22, 1963.<br/><br/>Here magnanimity works like a Swiss watch, there is no room for blunders, despite there are a few blunders; the film is a unit, but can also be dissected. For example, Larraín vivisects this woman at his whim, playing with the chronology like a time-space logogriph, goes from glorious moments to heart-rending memories. While he connects cathartic circumstances, shapes the leitmotiv; He manipulates a composed timing where Portman contemplates undaunted the euphonic melody of a violin or contemplates undaunted her husband's shattered skull on her lap, and then an agonizing dance unfolds which boasts of the scarlet stuff going down her legs or those spoils of the dura mater of the former President which viciously settled on her spotless face, a broad grin to fragility of every human being.In addition to superb English-language directional debut in the mecca of cinema made by Paul, the celluloid treasures an optimal and outstanding female lead, a woman who has cleared out everything in prestigious film festivals, she's Natalie Portman. Portman has retained a record quite high in roles that have been granted nominations and awards for her throughout her great acting life (""Black Swan""), nevertheless, this year she has raised up such mark with one of the roles more demanding, complex and laborious due to the impending restrictions of improvisation in this character. It's illogically sensational how she leads emotions of her character by a roller coaster, moves dazzle majestically with beautiful closeups of Stéphane Fontaine, which tempt us with power cocktails, tarnished colors, shadows and lights cinematic.<br/><br/>It seems that Larraín neither creates a film for money nor elates litigants critics, he manufactures film because he has a defined purpose to spread with his stories, communicating a sweet or bitter truth, to produce awakenings or merely to dispel inane realities. Starkness, accuracy, viscerally and irregularity, that's what delivers the Chilean filmmaker's ""Jackie"", a feature film is assiduously degraded due to a few screenplay disorientation, abrupt pace changes, and wrong narrative elections. It gives the impression that ""Jackie"" is a resource for a mass of photographers, cinematographers, composers, actors, sound editors... etc. show all their potential, their ideas and their powers with the story of the First Lady. At any rate, Jacqueline entrusted us her legacy as well as her spouse, a legacy which is collapsing with the passing of the years, and to name one example: who's the current President of America?<br/><br/>It's about time someone replaced the banal pink tweed by Jackie's real powerful story, an idol who became universal at the expense of her own joy."

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library.<br/><br/>Maybe it was different in the theater, but on the DVD the sound mix is annoying, the musical score is often ponderous and way too loud, detracting quite seriously from enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>Regarding the actual story, I remember Jackie Kennedy quite well, I was a freshman in college when JFK was murdered, and I remember the later years when Jackie married Aristotle Onassis, everyone assumed because he was wealthy. So watching any movie of Jackie, for me, is a pale imitation of having lived through it.<br/><br/>Still, Natalie Portman is credible as Jackie Kennedy, who was only 31 when she became First Lady, and only 34 when the events of 1963 occurred, pretty close to the actual age of Portman. I don't recall it seeming so young back then but today it seems very young.<br/><br/>When you listen closely to Jackie Kennedy you hear a slight speech impediment, a trait her daughter Caroline inherited. Portman clearly spent lots of time studying and practicing because she pretty much gets it right. <br/><br/>This movie focuses almost entirely on the events right before, during, and right after JFK's murder in the streets of Dallas, showing how Jackie reacted to what was going on, what demands she made, how she (and others) compared their almost 3 years as President and First Lady to ""Camelot."" <br/><br/>The storytelling technique is to use a fictional journalist, played by Billy Crudup, doing an in depth interview of Jackie in her residence after leaving the White House. For those who have grown up in more modern times this is a good movie to give a glimpse of this complex and often mysterious former First Lady."

","Jackie (2016) tells the story of Jacquelyn Kennedy and how she copes with the tragic loss of her husband, President John F Kennedy. Natalie Portman plays Jacquelyn, and she does a wonderful job portraying this historical woman and showing her trying her best to cope with the pain and grief of her husbands assassination. Peter Sarsagard plays bobby, JFK's brother, I think he did a good job at portraying him as accurately as possible. Suffice to say that the acting is wonderful all around by every single member of the cast in this film. I loved the writing too, the dialogue all throughout, especially by Portman, is all so well written and well delivered by the actors. The script focuses completely on Jackie and those around her reacting and attempting to deal with the presidents sudden and shocking death. The movie actually does show JFK's shooting (WARNING, which is kind of graphic), but it needed to be graphic in order to be completely authentic. You don't have to be interested in American history or politics to enjoy this very well made film. Anyone and everyone can and will enjoy this great movie. I encourage all to view it at least once, it's definitely worth it! 9/10 for Jackie."

","If you already know a lot about Jackie Kennedy and what made the woman tick (which I don't), this film named after her and chronicling the days surrounding the assassination of her husband and our nation's president might be fascinating. Those looking to this film to teach them something about the former first lady will be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>""Jackie"" is a tone poem of moods, one that remains frustratingly superficial when one wants it to delve deeper into the psyche of this woman who made such a deep impression on American popular culture. Natalie Portman, who received an Oscar nomination for bringing Jackie Kennedy back to life, is pretty good I guess, but she's really only asked to convey a procession of emotions that exist independently of one another rather than create a complete character. ""Jackie"" is about all of the things in relation to JFK's assassination that I didn't care much about (Jackie wandering around the White House trying on gowns while chain smoking) and about none of the things that I would have found interesting (like the actual impact the event had on her and her legacy).<br/><br/>Billy Crudup appears as an interviewer, Greta Gerwig is on hand as Jackie's right-hand woman, and Peter Sarsgaard makes no attempt to look or sound like Bobby Kennedy. But this is Portman's film all the way.<br/><br/>The film received two additional Oscar nods, one for Best Costume Design, which went to Madeleine Fontaine for recreating Jackie's signature period style (including the famous pink suit) and the other for Best Original Score, for Mica Levi's sparse music.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"dbcint","7","0","0","3 May 2017"," Life after death
","Biopics can be a tricky subject. If you try and cover the full life of a remarkable person, you're likely to end up glossing over some important events, or missing them completely. If you choose to focus on just a single event in the life of a real person, you can often lose some characterisation. <br/><br/>Jackie is basically a snapshot of the week after JFK was killed, and shows how Jacqueline Kennedy reacts to the loss of her husband, and how she has to present herself to the outside world. The death of JFK was certainly one of those moments that shocked the world, and I imagine would have turned everyone's focus to the White House for days or even weeks afterwards. (It was before my time, but I do remember the death of Princess Diana, and in a similar example from the entertainment world, Michael Jackson.)<br/><br/>Played by Natalie Portman, Jackie Kennedy spends the majority of the movie talking to either a reporter (Billy Crudup), or her priest (John Hurt) – neither of which, for some reason, are given names. These conversations often trigger Kennedy's memories and other moments from the week between her husband's passing and his funeral, with a focus given to the way Kennedy balances life as the now former First Lady with life as a new widow. In that, we also see how she breaks the news to her children, and copes with being a newly single mother – one who has to explain to very young children that their father isn't coming home.<br/><br/>Portman has a lot to do here. I can't tell you how well she does portraying Kennedy specifically, but as far as showing the balance the pressures of all aspects of the life of someone in this situation, she does remarkably well. The problem is her accent.<br/><br/>During Kennedy's presidency, Jackie opened the doors of the White House to a camera crew, showcasing some of the building's features for the public to see. Kennedy herself, with the help of a host / interviewer, narrated this series of videos, and the movie recreates several of them. In these, Kennedy is doing what she sees as a public duty, and her performance comes across as very stoic. She answers questions very simply, and on occasion points out some of her favourite pieces in terms of furniture and artwork. Portman's voice in these scenes is entirely different to her voice in the more natural scenes, where she's simply speaking to the reporter or the priest, and the difference between these voices is not only jarring, but her attempt at a native US accent is baffling, given that Portman moved to the US at age three, and her natural voice likely would have been fine here. Instead she tries to sound like she's a person of importance or distinction. Granted, the character she's playing most certainly is, but that's far better showcased through the film's wardrobe and the fact that Kennedy – at several points – must verbally go toe-to-toe with not only the reporter, but also White House officials and other politicians over arrangements for JFK's funeral, and not once does she back down or let herself be talked over simply because she's a woman and all the other power players at the time were men.<br/><br/>Kennedy does change her mind a couple of times, but it's implied that this is more about doing what the public would want versus what her husband would want, and trying to find some sense of privacy and normalcy for her family. But when she has to speak up and deal with the rest of said power players, Portman does indeed bring across an air of authority.<br/><br/>The central conflict of the film deals with whether or not Kennedy should accompany the car carrying her husband's body in the funeral procession. The film goes back and forth on this – which seems realistic, as making important decisions after the death of a loved one can be trying, with people changing their minds several times over – and one particularly dark moment in Kennedy's discussion with her priest gives some insight as to why she might want to accompany her husband's body.<br/><br/>Jackie is a difficult film to review or really talk about at all, as it doesn't really have a story. In other movies, I'd likely criticise that quite harshly. Here, a story isn't the point. It's a ""day in the life"" feature, and deals more with characters than it does plot points. The conflict mentioned above drives what little story there is, but even that serves as a way to give us insight into the way Kennedy was thinking in the days following her husband's death, and how that event affected her overall. In that, Jackie does a fine job, and for people who are particularly interested in this as a historical event, or who remember the assassination of JFK and wanted a more personal look at how that affected the people closest to him, Jackie is probably a film they'll want to check out, and I can even see it becoming a favourite of people's collections. For me, there were several interesting parts, and I particularly liked John Hurt as the priest, but most of the movie is probably lost on me simply due to age. <br/><br/>For what Jackie seemed like it was trying to accomplish, it does remarkably well. It's a shame Portman's voice was so grating in places, as that takes away from what was really a very good performance overall. While the story is practically non-existent, the character study does a great job of demonstrating why a movie like this doesn't necessarily need a story. <br/><br/>For my full review of this and other movies, visit my website at theblogfather.co.nz"

","For me, the image of November 22, 1963 forever opens with the bright pink of Jackie Kennedy's suit. Believe me when I say that America had a love affair with its First Family. Our First Lady was glamorous and cultured and opened the White House to us as never before. They were our extended family and we were proud of them, in love with Caroline and John-John, and happily hopeful with the future of our country. And when the President was killed, their loss was ours as well. I remember at age ten wanting to go to Washington and hug Jackie and Caroline and John-John and hold their hands. I remember watching every step of Jackie's brave walk, leading the world from the capital to the cemetery, all of us walking right beside her in spirit. Reading in retrospect I have learned so much more about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, what a complex and interesting character she really was. This film, though dark and depressing, has finally allowed me to share Jackie's personal turmoil in those first days. Natalie Portman's Jackie extends her hand and invites us into her head and heart. Deeply satisfying."

","I was born one day before JFK's assassination. I obviously have no memory of the event, and only the most limited memories of Jackie - and I remember her mostly as Jackie Onassis and not as the First Lady of the United States. I was interested in this movie for historical reasons. The Kennedy assassination is still one that intrigues people. There is, however, little about the actual shooting, aside from a pretty graphic portrayal of the impact of the bullet that hit JFK in the head near the end of the movie. As the title suggests (so it should come as no surprise) the movie is more about Jackie and her response to the shooting. Natalie Portman seemed to do a decent job as the title character, but somehow she just failed to connect with me. Something seemed off to me; something seemed missing. Certainly she captured the shock Jackie must have felt. In a whirlwind of a few days she went from being First Lady of the United States to the president's young widow, having to move out of the White House to make way for Lyndon and Ladybird Johnson, with no real plan for where to go or what to do with the rest of her life. All that came through, but Portman just didn't ""connect"" with me. I didn't find myself emotionally drawn in with Jackie, and in this kind of movie that's a definite problem. It's sombre and dark - as it should be. It shows scenes like Jackie wiping JFK's blood off her face. I should have ""felt"" something for her plight. And I didn't. That was a problem.<br/><br/>I also found it strange that the story kept coming back to the famous 1961 TV tour of the White House that Jackie gave. I didn't think that was a particularly effective means of moving the story along, nor did it reveal much to me about Jackie. <br/><br/>It's hard to say exactly what the problem was. Something just seemed missing here. I can't explain it any better than that, but this movie failed to make much of a connection with me. (5/10)"

In my opinion, she was even better than in the ""Black Swan"" (2010); expressing feelings of anger, sadness, happiness, and encouragement; even to a point of no feelings at all. The director of this film, is from Chile, the way he made the whole was incredible, specially because is very adaptable and relatable, cinematographycally speaking, to the 60's, the image is centered the whole film, also the cinematography is antique, the way the played with the colors was very pleasant, the custom design was a challenge that they overcome and turned into perfection.

Coupled with an unsuccessful attempt to mimic Jackie O's mannerisms, Ann says that Natalie gave off the air of ""Acting, with a capital A!"" Portman sounded more like a breathy finishing-school girl like Marilyn Monroe than a Kennedy. Although Portman attempted the right mannerisms, she never truly disappeared into the character she was portraying, so she was a distraction the entire film.<br/><br/>Les & Ann also DETESTED the director's interpretation of this woman. Ann adores the real Jackie O. because of her strength in leading the country during her most trying hours, but this film makes her look weak and powerless.

"Kingslaay","Null","0","0","21 March 2017"," Interesting look at an iconic figure but passable
","I have been a fan and intrigued by the Kennedy family for years. It is a dynasty full of great personalities that many people admire. So when Jackie was advertised I was eager to watch it and interested to see how Portman would pull it off. <br/><br/>Jackie is a film where certain elements or parts are better on their own then the film as a whole. The filming techniques and soundtrack stand apart as being extremely well done. Director Pablo Larrain wonderfully merges some scenes with archival footage such as the motorcade and Jackie shown staring at the actual crowds from the car. The music was powerful and matched the seriousness and drama that was shown. Perhaps the biggest flaw is Jackie herself played by Natalie Portman. She was not convincing in her portrayal and sadly failed to rise to the occasion. Her performance was safe at best where she looked the part and emulated Jackie but she was never Jackie. The audience was alienated from her throughout the film especially when we were supposed to relate to it. At the time of the assassination the world related to her and felt great respect for the real Jackie via a television or radio. Yet we find it hard to connect with Jackie from a more personal and private viewpoint. Even the scene where she changes her dress and listened to Camelot acted to show a childish and immature side to her. I am unsure whether this actually happened. Pablo also goes for moments or stills where he focuses on a shocked Jackie but the problem here is that the film hasn't built up towards those scenes and Portman hasn't won us over so these moments fall flat. Perhaps the film would have benefited if it cast somebody else, a great performance would have made this a great film perhaps in the same league as the Kings Speech and Oscar worthy. <br/><br/>I do not agree with the other critics who pointed out her one sided outlook during the film and how her loss and feelings were heightened compared to those around her. Might I remind viewers that this is Jackie's story and the film is centred around her and not the Kennedy family. In fact it makes it clear at the start because the story is told by Jackie to a Journalist about her account. If the acting was up to scratch you would have connected with Jackie rather than see a grown up throw a tantrum. Peter Sarsgaard was unimpressive and badly cast as Robert Kennedy. He looked nothing like him, sounded nothing like him, looked older than JFK his older brother and was even taller than JFK. In real life JFK was older, broader and taller than his brother.<br/><br/>Jackie mainly looks at a certain period in Jackie Kennedy's life, the aftermath of JFK's assassination and funeral. It has parallels to Spielberg's Lincoln released a few years ago that also looks at a certain part of his life. Based on the title one could easily assume it was about her life or parts of her life however if done right it could be impressive. 13 days is an example of a great film about a small period in the Kennedy's lives. <br/><br/>Overall Jackie is a passable film. For all the criticism of Portman she has done a safe job and is passable as Jackie. We have to acknowledge that she had very big shoes to fill. Don't be in such a rush to watch this one in theatres or even video, it can act as a good pastime one day."

But the real winner was Emma Stone in La La Land"" of course. You know, just saying.<br/><br/>""Jackie"" is the kind of project which makes you doubt yourself as a movie lover. You see all the quality work on screen and wonder why actually you're not liking it more. It must be you, right, not being able to cherish all the good movies, right? <br/><br/>Well, no.

","November 22, 1963 is a day everyone remembers as one of the more devastating moments in our history. That day that JFK was murdered was a hole in time and it is not likely anyone will ever be able to recreate that national and global sensitive loss, Writer Noah Oppenheim and Chilean director Pablo Larraín have tried and have shifted the national grief to a micro study of how that incident affected Jacqueline Kennedy. It works to a degree and to a degree it flounders in superfluous details – minor distractions such as Jackie's excessive smoking and the often-whiny timing that replaces her grief.<br/><br/>Opening the film with a journalist (Billy Crudup) interviewing Jackie (Natalie Portman) sets the pace for a re-run of the brief Kennedy time in the Whitehouse and Jackie's important role in restoring the history of the living space of many Presidents before JFK. Footage (re-enacted in black and white with Portman) reminds us of the extent of that renovation and pride in our history. The close relationship with her 'secretary' Nancy (Greta Gerwig), and her protection by Bobby Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) play a key role, but the impressive decision for Jackie to walk with the funeral cortege is matched only by her prolonged, sensitive discussion with her priest (John Hurt). Much of the rest of the overly long film is tedious and burdened with one of the weakest and most intrusive musical soundtracks ever written.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's performance is fine – whether the viewer can accept her interpretation of this difficult role is a personal decision. Despite the over-stressed Camelot plagiarism the film does take us back to that fateful day and how we all deal with that is again a personal matter."
"solidsteeler","6","0","0","9 March 2017"," What it might have been?
","Several aspects to this film were very well done. The casting of Portman as Jackie was very good, the actor chosen to play President Kennedy, Caspar Phillipson, was a great look-a-like, though lacked the physical size of JFK. The film is done as an interview that relies on a flashback element. These flashbacks are not done in a linear manner however, the very nature of the well known subject does not require it to be done that way. I have always wondered what Jackie must have endured during that horror, & how she remembered it. She had given a detailed interview that included her experience setting next to her husband, our President, but it was not given over for publication. One wonders how much of this was true to that interview, but I do not recall seeing anything that says if it was directly taken from that interview. It was presented in a fashion that one could reasonably presume that it did. The various events & circumstances after the assassination that the public was not privy to added to the tumult that Jackie was thrust into & which she had to deal with as grieving widow, mother & first lady. For those who question her strength, you must consider the man JFK was, the overbearing nature of the Kennedy family, the repressive nature of those people that surround the Presidency, the unrelenting intrusiveness of the press. It's not a stretch to imagine for Jackie to function in that environment she had to be a person of formidable inner strength. Also, if one recalls how she guarded her children for many years following the assassination, and throughout her life that followed, you also see a woman of great resolve. I thought this aspect of the portrayal of Jackie was more likely true than not & is fairly well presented in this film.<br/><br/>The question throughout this picture is how much of it is creative license of filmmakers, and how much is based on actual knowledge & record from those who would have witnessed these events that the public did not. One such event presented in the film was the confrontation Jackie has with RFK/Bobby after she discovers that he withheld from her the killing of Oswald. This is a powerful scene partly because it followed an equally powerful scene in which RFK takes control of a room that included the then President, LBJ, and other key members of the Presidents staff & family, essentially ordering them to do as he instructs, which was to not reveal to Jackie the killing of Oswald that they had just witnessed on television. This also succinctly told of the tensions between LBJ & RFK. Follow that with this scene in which Jackie reproaches the powerful Bobby for his attempt to control the information Jackie needs in making her decisions. As an act of creative license by the filmmakers it was a powerful scene, if it is indeed an event that truly occurred then it is all the more powerful and revealing as to Jackie's strength.<br/><br/>Further commenting on casting, Peter Sarsgaard is a fine actor and has an impressive portfolio. His work here as RFK some how falls short. There are well written moments throughout the film for him, and he doesn't exactly botch them, but I was left with the feeling that they could have been better. The effort to make Portman as much like Jackie in appearance, in vocal style as well as physical likeness, coupled with the physical resemblance that one has to feel was of the utmost importance in the casting of Caspar Phillipson as JFK would have naturally lifted expectations that the casting of other crucial people, such as RFK, would have been equally emphasized. But it was not, especially with Sarsgaard as RFK. I don't generally require actors to be dead-on look-a-likes and/or sound-a-likes, but if you set that standard with other casting, it becomes noticeable if others are not. I'll also mention that aside from this, the portrayal of the priest by John Hurt was very good and the lines he had were well written & of course well delivered. The question again arises, were these created or were they included from some true record? There is a lack of involvement within the story line of the children, Caroline & John F. Kennedy Jr. Given how guarded Jackie always was regarding her children, it is no surprise. It's to bad because that would have been an element that would have been very interesting & perhaps would have made Jackie seem less distant as has been suggested. I do not agree with that assessment, but I admit there is some quality lacking here that serves as an injustice to her memory. I can not quite grasp what it is, but it is a feeling that one is left with. That is a true shame since so many people who lived during this tragic time so admired her courage and how she gave strength to a stunned & deeply saddened nation. One other little bit that was missed in this film was the scene so many recall of John Jr. saluting his Father as his coffin passes by. It would have been a good piece to these events to have been included & to have also had some insight as to how it came about or the reaction to it by Jackie.<br/><br/>Why What Might Have Been? Because of some missed opportunities & omissions. Also because in the DVD special features it mentions that other filmmakers had optioned at various times to make this picture. One of those was Steven Spielberg, & I was left wondering how this film would have been presented if he had been at the helm. I have no experience with Pablo Larraín, and I am sure he has made some quality films. I just feel he missed some elements to this story line that perhaps some one such as Spielberg would not have."

I expected it would show us that Jackie was more than just the President's wife, whose only job was to look good at state occasions. Unfortunately, Jackie portrays Jackie as nothing without Jack.<br/><br/>Jackie shows the events that took place in the week that followed the assassination of JFK, with few flashbacks of Jackie's tour of the White House and of her marriage. It is all presented as a modern-day fairy tale of a woman that got married to a powerful man and lived in a big white castle as a princess. JFK's numerous infidelities, Jackie's friendship with Aristotle Onassis, the cracks the two of them had in their marriage, the Cold War - it is nowhere to be found. The Cuban missile crisis is only barely mentioned.<br/><br/>I also think that the writer should have included more of the other members of the Kennedy family. Bobby and Rose Kennedy are the only one that have lines. Jack, Ethel, Ted, Joan, Joseph Kennedy - I don't think they are even presented to us. As if they didn't play any parts in this story. Bobby is shown as Jackie's biggest support after JFK's death, but their relationships is dealt with in a very superficial way.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gives an amazing performance as Jackie, and she deserved her Oscar nomination. John Hurt, Greta Gerwig and Billy Cudrup all do their characters justice. Peter Sarsgaard was, in my opinion, completely miscast as Bobby.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching only for Natalie Portman's performance, nice visuals, pretty costumes and settings. If you want to find it more about the Kennedy family, watch Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot (2001)."

","Biopics are a thorny undertaking. The usual old-school and conventional films attempted to re-count the subject's whole life ticking every required box both narratively and artistically. The proliferation of biopics or TV series, despite making the genre and the approach tiresome and unimaginative never really determined its disappearance or decline. In recent years however biopics are offered in different clothing, a characterization of the figure, focusing on a single defining event.<br/><br/>The film depicts Jackie Kennedy's four days following husband and then President John F. Kennedy's assassination in Dallas in 1963. The film's biggest strength is however what might pull away most: it's very personal, circumspect, sombre and emotionally violent approach. As the film unfolds, you realise that there would be no better way of telling this story, of defining this figure and this event. Larraín's firm, precise and artistic lens doesn't leave Portman for a minute, catching Jackie's every emotion, from the most contained glare to every discomposure. Despite being an almost one-woman-show it is not Portman's competent yet slightly caricatural performance that defines Jackie; it's the amalgamation of comprehensive talent, from the spotless art direction and costume design, to the elegant cinematography and overbearing yet appropriate score that altogether elevate the work."

","If there is a peg to hang this movie on, it would be the immortal musical number ""Camelot"" from the immortal musical with the same title. The emphasis however would be just on that one song, and not the entire context of the musical. After all, there is no Lancelot (this is Jackie, not Diana). Nor is there a really meaningful parallel in Marilyn Monroe (Anya cannot truly be compared with Monroe in that context). I digress. But I will come back to Camelot, again and again.<br/><br/>This is not a biopic but focuses mostly on the two weeks after JFK's assassination, with some flashback on the Kennedys' early days at the White House. There is considerable juxtaposition between the three main lines of narrative, even to the extents of flashbacks within flashbacks. But it is not confusing in the sense that we all know only too well what had happened (even those in the audience born way after the Kennedy era, because of the publicity).<br/><br/>First, there is straightforward narration, occasionally from Jackie's own POV. Secondly, there is the interview with a nameless ""the journalist"" (Billy Crudup with cool, contained aggression) that is quite obviously the real-life interview with Theodore H. White. Finally, there are broken yet connected confession-like talks with yet another nameless ""the priest"" played by John Hurt. As this great actor who passed away at the beginning of this year still has three yet-to-be-released movies, ""Jackie"" is unlikely to be his final gift to the cinematic world.<br/><br/>This movie attempts to portray Jackie from many different angles: myth, historical icon, celebrity at her height, devastated widow, mother, glamorous goodwill ambassador, unyielding figure of dignity with icy determination. Natalie Portman's work has been recognized by critics in awarding her with the ""Critics' Choice"" Best Actress award. There have also been a proliferation of nominations and wins in relatively minor awards. In view of Emma Stone's seemingly unstoppable momentum, Portman's odds at winning Oscar does not look too hopeful.<br/><br/>Different people will be drawn by different depictions of Jackie. One thing however that would be felt across a wide spectrum of audience is Jackie's aloneness and the pressure she constantly endures. The single most memorable scene is one showing Jackie doing various mundane routines in her room before the funeral. There were all kind of people around her but in a way, she was absolutely alone. Playing at the background is Richard Burton's singing of ""Camelot"" in the original sound track of the musical. As many will remember, to the Kennedys, Camelot is synonymous with The White House, a dream-come-true, a fairy tale. This scene is poignancy personified. This scene is at around the midpoint of the movie.<br/><br/>Towards the end, quietly seeping into the background are a few lines of ""Camelot"" that Burton chose to deliver as spoken lines, exquisitely beautifully. As I have listened to the soundtrack for countless times over a few decades since I acquired it, I became clairvoyant and immediately saw the grand finale of the movie two minutes before it came: the resplendent, rousing chorus picking up the lyrics, bringing it to a soaring height ""That once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known As Camelot"", and the screen darks on cue, exactly as the music ends."

"CineMuseFilms","8","3","9","16 January 2017"," Natalie Portman gives a memorable performance about an unforgettable event.
","History and drama often make awkward bedfellows, as you might find in the bio-pic Jackie (2016). The assassination of JFK is one of the defining moments of the 20th century and any dramatization of the immediate aftermath is a risky venture. History buffs may fault it and others may struggle with its melodramatic interpretation of Jaqueline Kennedy's life-defining event. But look beyond the cinematic limitations and you find a complex portrait of a remarkable person who endured an unimaginable horror with rare strength and dignity.<br/><br/>The film's starts with the motorcade in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated and ends with his funeral. The narrative is framed around a journalist's interview conducted a week after the event and a confessional talk with a priest at the funeral. It uses their questions and comments to trigger flashbacks to the short JFK presidency, with dramatisations that craft together archival footage and historical photographs. The title of the film makes it clear that this is a portrait of Jackie (played by Natalie Portman) so her words, her emotions, and her actions are the primary focus. The film's narrative tension comes entirely from the depiction of her inner world of private trauma and her struggles with the political and public reaction to the event.<br/><br/>The most striking aspect of Portman's portrayal is her ability to present several sides of the one persona as if she and Jackie shared multiple personalities. Once you recover from the distraction that Portman barely resembles Jaqueline Kennedy, she takes you on an emotional roller-coaster, from terror, anger, hate, confusion, mental vacillation and disorientation to calm resolve about her role in history. Throughout it all she remains committed to turning a tragedy into national mythology based on political heroism, the Kennedy legend, and the Camelot fairy tale. While there is a commendable support cast, this is a one-woman performance and Portman's portrayal is a tour de force.<br/><br/>Some will find this film an unflattering interpretation of Jaqueline Kennedy while others will find that it helps them to sympathetically understand the person behind the mask. The film steers a fine line in avoiding judgement and it is Portman's dramatic ability to step into Jackie's soul and to capture her mental trauma that ultimately shines. No bio-pic is perfect and you need to overlook scenes where the film struggles with period authenticity. Set this aside and you will be rewarded with a memorable performance about an unforgettable event. AUTHOR: cinemusefilms.com"

","""Jackie"" is one of, if not the most scatterbrained movie I have ever watched in my life. It is so incoherently put together and flawed in almost every department of its making that I'm convinced the person who made this might not have even a rudimentary understanding of filmmaking.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) mere days after her husband's assassination as she explains what happened over the following days to a reporter (Billy Crudup).<br/><br/>Almost everything about this movie is off and fundamentally flawed. The cinematography is obviously trying to be stylistic, but it does not fit and makes some scenes look downright atrocious. The editing in this movie is awful. The sound editing does not blend well with the movie, and a number of scenes are edited to have jump cuts that negatively affect the scene. Natalie Portman's acting is better than it has been in other roles, but she is still not believable, and she can't pull off Jackie Kennedy's accent. The story is about an interesting and iconic individual, and is based completely around her planning her husband's funeral. The movie is told non chronologically, but the order of the scenes and how flashbacks are set up really don't have much correlation with one another and were just arbitrarily placed throughout the movie's story line.<br/><br/>The only good things I can really say about the movie is that the writing was decent, it included a few interesting details about Jackie Kennedy and the events following JFK's assassination, and there was great attention to the film's aesthetics."

","First of all, the sound track was so distracting, far too loud, too long, too dramatic and frankly, ugly. Portman is an incredible actress but her characterization of Jacqueline Kennedy was just that. Unreal, exaggerated and exhausting. Perhaps there was some of the real Jackie in there somewhere but I doubt any viewers will believe it possible when the odd voice and mannerisms and drama just go on and on and on. And on. And on. I feel rather sorry for Caroline and the grandchildren that this is how their mother and grandmother is being represented. Yes, she was far too much of an icon, an idol even, but is it necessary to destroy our memories in such an over-realistic way? Especially for those who remember 'where they were' on that unforgettable November day, for those whose pain was somewhat assuaged by the beauty and dignity of Jacqueline Kennedy, I would nt recommend trying to sit through this unworthy movie."

The film begins with Jackie being interviewed by a reporter from 'Life' magazine, he is exploring life in The Whitehouse and a minute by minute account of the assassination.<br/><br/>The film is a character study, it compares Jackie 'The First Lady' vs Jackie 'the woman/wife'. It doesn't focus on the assassination but more on the way Jackie deals with the consequences and the public reaction.<br/><br/>One scene that really stuck in my mind was where Jackie is travelling in the hearse, she is speaking to the driver, she names other presidents who were also assassinated and she asks what they remember about their achievements. Jackie realises her husband hadn't achieved very much during his half term, so she decides that she needs to desperately create an important legacy! My wife strangely disliked this film, everything about the actual character which makes me think Natalie Portman must have really nailed it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is convincing as the grief stricken widow, and this film is a good showcase for her acting talents.

"vittorio-parri","6","2","5","22 January 2017"," The Myth behind the Man
","There is so much to say about Jackie Kennedy, a woman, a pioneer, an Icon, and a first lady that more than anyone else stayed behind the Man and the Myth of her own husband. There is so much to say that certainly a movie cannot contain it all. For this reason the choice of focusing on the days after the death of JFK, and the consequent creation of the Myth of her husband, are certainly the most obvious for the portrait of this woman that worked elegantly through history. Choosing one of the Two interviews that Jackie Kennedy had made after her husband death, the film narrates the first moments after J.F. Kennedy assassination and the consequent creation of his Myth due to his state funeral. Although the double sided interpretation of Natalie Portman, clearly focused on the continuous switch between the Jackie-Persona and the private-Jackie, that gives the audience some brilliant moment of lucid madness, and a performance that hardly can be forgotten (especially for the close resemble of movement and gestures, and the drastic change of voice and character in every different occasions), the movie itself is too revealing and seems to be more focused on the creation of the myth of the man, more than the one of the woman. For instance it is certainly lacking of that aura of discretion and elegance that permitted this woman to became herself The Myth. The directing is interesting, with some brave decisions such as the recreation of the assassination and the first open doors of the white house, and some quick cuts that surely revealed an extended amount of material that didn't fit in the time limit but has to be shown anyway. In Conclusion is a movie that can be easily watch to have another point of view of a recent history, but certainly it doesn't give us those answers that we might have look for and we undoubtedly still have about this great woman that with her elegance and her class charmed not just one man, but the entire world."
"quinimdb","7","2","5","25 December 2016"," Jackie
","""Jackie"" is a nuanced portrayal of Jackie Kennedy in the days surrounding JFK's assassination. We see her calm composure in the days before and her struggle to maintain this in the days after. It dies show the assassination itself, but each time it shows a little bit more, and each time it's a bit more intense and disturbing. The film is done entirely from the perspective of Jackie herself, and the film jumps around through time in such a way as if we are looking into her mind ourselves. The cinematography shows this through constantly being intimately close to Jackie's face. Considering this is a film driven by the central character of Jackie Kennedy (and her alone), this film required a great central performance, and Natalie Portman gives one. It goes further than the fact that she talked with the same voice as Jackie Kennedy. Perhaps the most visceral and emotionally resonant part of the film, was her performance. Even in this horrible, terrifying situation, Natalie Portman never resorts to overacting. The soundtrack is fantastic and conveys a sense of dread throughout the film.<br/><br/>Through her political dealings, her first interview after the assassination, and, most of all, several meetings with a Priest, we learn much about this important historical figure. Jackie Kennedy is humanized through this film. We learn about her conflicts during the aftermath of the assassination, and despite constantly depicting herself as strong and resilient to the public, we see that she was absolutely confused, lonely, and terrified underneath. She clearly loved her husband and wanted badly to honor him, but she also romanticized him to the point where he was no longer a real human in her mind, but instead a perfect legend. It is insinuated several times that she didn't have a perfect relationship with her husband. Her children were all that she had left and she wanted to protect them, but she mentions she wants to be assassinated like her husband, not just for the fame, but just to be with him. It seems she felt that she lost potential with JFK, and I think that's why she tried so hard to make sure she and her husband went down in history. More than anything, it seems Jackie just felt lonely.<br/><br/>This film is a bit cluttered in its narrative structure, but since this is primarily a character study, I didn't mind. The film isn't about the historical figure, but the human being behind that facade. The film is simply an intimate and personal portrayal of a conflicted woman in horrible circumstances."
"meeza","8","2","5","22 December 2016"," Mica Levy and Natalie Portman were quite a hit in ""Jackie""
","Jacqueline Kennedy was probably one of the most famed female figures of the 20th Century. Director Pablo Larrian's ""Jackie"" focuses on Kennedy's grief period after her infamous President husband John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Oscar-winner Natalie Portman stars as the former First Lady and marvels in a performance that is quite very presidential and should garner her lots of movie award love. Peter Sarsgaard co-stars in a subtle performance as Bobby Kennedy. One up on Billy Crudup for his fine performance as ""the Reporter"" who interviews Kennedy a few weeks after the murder of her husband. It was great to see John Hurt back on the silver screen here playing an advising priest to Mrs. Kennedy. Larrian's directorial effort here was sound & solid and stood up more as an experimental independent piece than a overexposed Oscar-bait delivery. Noah Oppenheim's script was credible but not sensational. Mica Levi's pounding score of the movie was probably its resounding feature; yes, even more than Portman's outstanding performance, that is how brilliant it was. In all, ""Jackie"" deserves a viewing. **** Good"

","Even at this incredible, ever-changing, unprecedented moment in our country's history, we are still living in the aftermath of the assassination of the beloved 35th president, John F. Kennedy. What we lost in him was a beautiful, prosperous America that would've sent us all into a golden age. His death sent us spiraling into an age of cynicism and rage. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the streets of Newark, NJ. Our country hasn't missed an opportunity to honor him, especially through film. But what about his beloved, Jackie O? What is her side of this tragic story?<br/><br/>Pablo Larrain directs a visually striking, and beautifully acted portrait of our most treasured of FLOTUS's, complete with another career defining performance from Natalie Portman. She blows the doors off the hinges as Jackie. What a stunning, breathtaking portrayal. I kept forgetting that she was only in a movie. I wasn't watching archival footage. But that's the real strength of the film. It's made to look and feel like a fluid piece of American history, complete with cinematography that looks like it was shot on Super 16mm film. Many moments of the film caught my eye and many others broke my heart. I will always remember the long shot of Jackie, in Air Force One shortly after the assassination, cleaning the blood of her husband off of her face, weeping. Or perhaps what the song ""Camelot"" meant to her husband, as they danced to it in the very last scene of the film. You feel her agony, and her loss.<br/><br/>But despite all of this well deserved praise, Jackie isn't a film I'd watch ever again. It's extremely slow paced for it's 99 minutes, and that perhaps is deliberate. But it makes for a sleepy time at the movies. Also, Peter Sarsgaard was not convincing as RFK, and neither was John Carroll Lynch as LBJ. Portman's performance as Jackie is so monumental, that the other lackluster performances do not contribute much at all by comparison."
"ferguson-6","8","3","10","10 December 2016"," behind Camelot
","Greetings again from the darkness. There will be two distinct groups that erroneously presume this is a traditional biopic of the glamorous former first lady: those who wave it off as Lifetime Channel fare, and those who excitedly walk in thinking they are going to be swept away in the pink Chanel suit from that fateful day in November 1963. Instead, the first English language feature from director Pablo Larrain (No, 2012) offers up a what-might-have-been look behind the scenes and takes a stab at the psychological make-up of the often underestimated and complex woman known even today as simply Jackie.<br/><br/>The opening scene provides the first of countless close-ups of Natalie Portman as Jackie. Different than the usual movie close-ups, these are somehow closer – more intimate and more intrusive. The shots make us uncomfortable, as if we are intruding on her personal space. This is by design, as the film takes us to a surreal place where we see Jackie the person, rather than Jackie the icon. The framing device used is an interview she granted to Life Magazine reporter Thomas H White (Billy Crudup billed only as ""the journalist"") at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, merely a week after the assassination.<br/><br/>To grasp the concept here from director Larrain and writer Noah Oppenheim (in a big stretch from The Maze Runner), it's imperative to understand that, at the time, Jackie was the personification of a nation's grief and the ultimate example of dignity and grace (yes, Seinfeld fans, she had grace). We quickly witness the power and control she wielded. ""Don't think for a second I'm going to allow you to publish that""  she states after exposing her most vulnerable and personal thoughts. Later, she puffs on a cigarette and tells the reporter, ""I don't smoke"". It's in these moments that we begin to realize the point – Jackie was a master at generating the ""proper"" public perception from even the harshest personal realities (many of which the film politely ignores).<br/><br/>Much of the film deals with her dogged pursuit of creating a lasting legacy for her husband. The idea of Camelot was meant to provide hope and idealism to the public who so wanted to idolize and romanticize the first couple. The symmetry with Lincoln – the portrait, the bedroom and the meticulously planned elaborate funeral procession – were meant to establish heft and substance for an all-too-brief administration that even had brother Robert (Peter Sarsgaard) lamenting how little was accomplished. These were the calculated strategies of a woman who was much more than the charming and slightly nervous host who took America on a televised tour of The White House on CBS in 1962.<br/><br/>The film utilizes flashbacks to the Lincoln Continental with the Texas Schoolbook Depository in the background, as well as detailed recreations of The White House, Parkland Hospital, Air Force One, St. Matthew's Cathedral, and of course, the pink Chanel dress. That said, this is certainly not a movie designed to solve the case or disprove one of the conspiracy theories  it remains steadfast as a close-up of Jackie.<br/><br/>Others in supporting roles include a nearly unrecognizable (and minus her usual ticks) Greta Gerwig as Nancy Tuckerman (Jackie's social secretary and friend), John Carroll Lynch and Beth Grant as LBJ and Lady Bird, Max Casella as Jack Valenti, stunning lookalike Caspar Phillipson as JFK, and a remarkable John Hurt as the Priest helping Jackie through her spiritual crisis. But of course this is Natalie Portman's movie. She captures the breathy vocals and the contrasting strong directness when dealing with Bobby and Lyndon. Her movements mirror those from the actual footage of the White House tour  it's really a performance to behold.<br/><br/>Many original images, videos, and clips are blended/spliced into the re-enactments to add a touch of sentimentality and prove how close to reality the film holds. One thing to brace for is the most unique score you'll likely hear in a film this year. Mica Levi's unusual sound brilliantly complements the many moods of Jackie, and even manages to remain strong around Richard Burton's blasting of ""Camelot"". Ms. Portman's performance and the behind-the-curtain approach work well in reminding us that these were real people  not just Kennedys."

","Jackie tells the story of former First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, as she struggles to cope with the assassination of her husband, John F. Kennedy. While many people are concerned with the magic bullet theory, Jackie is concerned with the life of the woman behind the 35th President of the United States after she endures having to watch her husband die in that now infamous car ride in Dallas. There is no room for macho-ism here. This film is a singular burst of estrogen on screen as we follow Portman's Jackie navigate through the days after her husband's death. This isn't a film in which a woman discovers herself through a man. This is a film about a strong woman put in a near impossible situation and how she coped with that impossible situation to become exactly what she was known to most of the world as: the strongest woman alive.<br/><br/>First off, this film is a brilliant character study. Running at a brisk 96 minutes, the film is relentless in showing every facet of Jackie's life both before and after the assassination. Natalie Portman is astounding as the titular character. She plays Mrs. Kennedy with such honesty and tenacity that it is almost impossible to look away. This is a performance for the ages and definitely Portman's best performance since her Oscar winning performance in Black Swan. While the film features an amazing performance from Portman and the rest of the cast, including an impressive turn from Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy along with Billy Crudup and Greta Gerwig, it fails to captivate the audience past the phenomenal performances.<br/><br/>The film, despite being a brisk 96 minutes, doesn't allow for anything other than the performances to speak. The cinematography, while very nice and well done, doesn't really work like it should. It never feels as grand or as sweeping as it should for such an amazing subject matter. It hits the familiar beats of a character study and walks to the tune of a standard biopic. But no matter how familiar this film ends up feeling, for every standard point to it, there's an extraordinary performance to off set it.<br/><br/>Overall, Jackie is a film that was made for heavy hitting actors that can give breathtaking performances and our cast doesn't disappoint even if the film sometimes does. It hits every familiar beat that the biopic formula has created over the years. While this may sound like a negative, it does fit this film and does wonders for Natalie Portman's searing and commanding performance."

","Natalie Portman can't really act. I don't understand why everyone's so enamored with her. She was good in Black swan because she only had to play that 'always on the verge of tears, I don't know what's going on' kinda character that she ALWAYS and can ONLY play. Everything with her seems forced and akward. Rehearsed. She doesn't make me feel like I'm watching Jackie she makes me feel like I'm watching a hohum actress play Jackie. Sure she can memorize and recite the lines. She can cry on Q Yadda yadda but she never really takes on her characters persona. In fact that's the case with quiet a few of the characters in this. With all the liberties they took for this movies story lines they failed to really tell me anything honest about this woman. Anything that would make her endearing or even any more memorable than she already was....or wasn't. Maybe that was the point? That she wasn't so great after all? I dunno, didn't make me believe that either, being that a lot of what they did in this never actually happened that way. I just don't understand why people rave over Portman's acting?? Let's be honest, she's been the worst part of most of movies she's in. Far more bad than good in my opinion. Someday I'd love to see this done with actors that can make me believe the roles they are playing. Give us a story line that is factual and has some interesting and relevant history in it. Show us the real Jackie that we never got to see. The one from behind the doors. The woman behind the man. The real Jackie was way more than just a fashion icon and wife that had a crappy week. She was a lovely, interesting, powerful woman for her time and she deserves to have her actual story told. The good AND the bad. This is basically ""the week after"" staring a make believe version of Jackie O, not a true biography of Jackie or her life."
"Moviespot","2","2","6","25 February 2017"," Focussing on Hilarious & fake Jackie Kennedy voice spoiled the movie for me
","Now this is one boooring movie. Why is it that if one plays an historical figure..the actor needs to present itself as close as possible to the original but with the focus on the wrong details? The most terrible aspect of this film is the fact that Portman has to speak, master the same dixie, as Jackie Kennedy. If one hears Jackie Kennedy speak on old footage it sounds natural...it's her. But listening to Portman is tiresome..she sounds sooo artificial and unnatural..and that's because she isn't speaking with her own voice. All that matter's is the character portrayal isn't it? even if the voice is different. or not so articulate....i't like when in those war movies an actor playing a German has to speak English with a 'German'accent.Sounds crazy ass hell. We'll...the only thing i could enjoy a bit in watching this was the music score, but that 's about it! Portman should'v given the voice a subtler input ( a director thing) and really present Jackie through the effect of her portrayal of the character."
"pamma09","8","2","6","21 January 2017"," Camelot told again
","Two main reasons for watching this film for me - I was a freshman in college when JFK was killed and I wanted to see how Natalie Portman portrayed her. That is a day I will never forget - yes the Kennedys were the royalty of the United States - a handsome President, A beautiful wife and young children. The sudden change in her life had to have been incredibly hard for her to endure and all in the public eye. The nation was mourning but nothing could compare with HER grief. Portman's portrayal is so good - the grief, the mothering, the trying to have her husband honored, and of course there is the Kennedy family wishes and then she is homeless. She was not able to grieve alone and that would have been so hard. Everything she did was so public. I like the way the story is presented - an interview with a reporter and of course she had control of how it would be presented. The usage of old film to help tell the story was done well - soon the young will not know the story as I do. The White House must hold so many secrets - wish the wall could talk."

","I knew I needed to see this film in the theater. Thank God I followed my gut on that. What I saw would not be translated watching it on TV the first time. I'm sure I will watch it again and again.<br/><br/>For those of us who lived through that day, that time, that moment of finding out that our President was assassinated, and watching all the events that followed after would appreciate this film. We truly got an intimate view of what it was like to be Jackie at that time.<br/><br/>After leaving the theater I had to air out so to speak. Get myself to the place where I wasn't going to burst into tears. I felt this film deep in my core. It was real. I have my own memories that have been imprinted upon me. I remember, as clear as sitting here now, watching the procession to Arlington Cemetery. I looked up at my dad, and for the first time I saw him cry. Ever since that day many Americans have been haunted by unanswered questions. Many of us know the answer, however we want to think that our country is better than that. So we ignore that voice. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman gave a chilling, and deeply emotional performance as Jackie. For me, she is the very best Jackie ever. Natalie gave us everything we did not see. Inside Jacqueline Kennedy. I will tell everyone that adored her, and that loved the Kennedy's to see this film. There was nothing boring about it. You had to really watch to see what was taking place. I didn't know what I was going to see, and I was pleasantly surprised. The best way to see films is to know what you like, and not have any expectations. Be open. The film may not be about the character as much as it may be about you. If your going to see this film with comparisons in your mind, don't go. Film is recreational art. It's entertainment, It's getting away, and relaxing into another world, another time in some instances. It is learning about others, and history. Our film makers are doing their homework better than they use to so we are very fortunate to be educated by this medium."

"Lewis_Heather787","8","1","2","17 November 2017"," Stunning Performance and a surprisingly interesting film!
","To be honest I wasn't expecting much with this film, especially considering that I didn't bother to go to the cinema and watch it. However this film is surprisingly good, due to a number of key and important parts to it that work on many levels. <br/><br/>The Performances. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman is a fantastic actress, I'm pretty sure we all knew that by now but I don't think or can't remember a film where she embodies a character more than this film. She is utterly fantastic in the film showing a wide range of heavy emotions that are carried throughout the film, in a number of different time periods the film touches on. No wonder that she got awards nominations, I'm actually surprised that she didn't win because this is probably the best performance of her career to date. There are so many great aspects to the performance, starting with the incredible voice that Portman is able to achieve, it is almost exactly the same as Jackie Kennedy. In some way it is quite creepy how good it actually is especially when you then listen to the real Jackie from old videos. As well as the voice its the walk and the attitude changes from before the assassination to the funeral that are so believable. Absolute terrific from start to finish.<br/><br/>It should also be said that the other main actors in the film are good as well, Peter Sarsgaard, Billy Crudup, Greta Gerwig and John Hurt round out the main cast of the film. They are fine additions to the film when sprinkled throughout. <br/><br/>The Story.<br/><br/>Somehow the writers behind the film have made an incredibly interesting, complex and historic story blend seamlessly together in a really neat film. There are four parts to the story of the film that are woven throughout, 1) Reporter interview with Jackie after Assassination 2) The White House Tour documentary 3) 22nd November 1963 4) The Funeral. These four parts are executed very well and show new insights into what happened on the fateful day in 1963 and the personal ramifications after, leading up to the funeral. Each part was given its own time to breath and develop as individual stories, eventually combining together to give a fulfilling narrative of Jackie Kennedy's story throughout this period. Another positive of this type of story telling is the fact it makes the film more interesting and gives and nice flow and change of pace when needed. For example when one part of the story has been going on for a while the film will then break away to a different area, which is refreshing and moves the film along nicely. <br/><br/>The Directing.<br/><br/>Honestly Id never heard of Pablo Larrain before this film but now he is definitely on my radar as a director, this film is brilliantly made from start to finish and the credit has to go to him for his vision for this film. There are a number of key issues that he gets completed right in the film, if not done right they could have been glaring holes personally for me anyway. Firstly he handles the time period and the subject matter with great respect because it is very sensitive and is one of the most important parts of not only the United States history but of the world as well. Larrain doesn't glorify the assassination in anyway which easily could have been done which this film is not about, its about the personally and emotional journey of Jackie Kennedy after the event. Obviously the assassination is shown respectively in the film but very briefly and is actually talked about more by the characters rather than shown which was an interesting idea. Overall he has made an extremely interesting film which is shot beautifully and directing perfectly. <br/><br/>The Score.<br/><br/>What an interesting choice for the score of the film but personally for me it is one of the standouts of the film. It is strangely haunting and sombre at the same time which is a interesting contrast, this is due to the event and the emotional mood of the main character Jackie Kennedy. Its as if the score is an extension of Jackie's emotions and heartbreak throughout the film, and it definitely delivers in that regard.<br/><br/>Overall this film is 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10, I was actually surprised in how much I enjoyed this film, yes its not the most lighthearted film you could watch but its very good from start to finish with barely any flaws. Natalie Portman is fantastic in the role, the woven story threads throughout the film are really good, great directing from Pablo Larrain and lastly the film has good pace and re-watchability factor to it. Yeah I personally think that this is underrated and is one of the best Biopics I've seen in a while."
"iquine","8","1","2","1 November 2017"," Jackie's Raw Emotions
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Bang! JFK has just been shot and the audience is thrust into the mind of Jackie Kennedy as she deals with the infamous event. The film's foundation is Jackie being interviewed calmly at her home. The interview is interspersed between the few days immediately after the shooting and gets into raw detail of her state of mind, shock, lonesomeness and beginning to say farewell. Portman IS the film as many scenes are her face in close-up as she powerfully portrays a myriad of emotions. From what I can recall, the score is often a somber violin softly complementing her frequent moments of grief. Great cinematography with many muted colors aside from Jackie's red dress. A very interesting and effective approach to this historical event."
"Hawkensian","7","1","2","18 October 2017"," The deliberate pacing may test your patience, but Jackie remains an authentically personal account of an infamous crime
","It doesn't matter who you are or how much privilege you enjoy, having your spouse murdered so brutally beside you is a monstrous tragedy. Jackie captures the pain, both sharp and bleak, that the First Lady must have experienced during and after her husband's assassination. A particularly poignant moment is when Jackie sobs as she wipes the blood from her face; it is her first moment alone since the horrific shock of her life-changing trauma. However, her character becomes less sympathetic as she reveals a prickly demeanour with a tendency to be difficult. Not a diva by any means, just a bit unnecessary.<br/><br/>The performances and period detailing are excellent, but Pablo Larrain's deliberate pacing is just a little bit too slow. It gets to the point where the repeated shots of Jackie's withdrawn doe-eyed face elicit annoyance rather than pathos. At 1hr 40 minutes, Jackie is not a long film, yet it could have and perhaps should have been even shorter. Perhaps the editor's scissors could have been taken to the sequences with Jackie's priest (John Hurt), which consist largely of asinine religious musings. Then again, Catholicism was more important to the Kennedys than it is to me.<br/><br/>Even with the pacing issues, Jackie remains an authentically personal account of an infamous crime."
"BoomerDT","8","1","2","10 October 2017"," Creating the myth of JFK and ""Camelot""
","There is a scene about 1/3 of the way through ""Jackie"" where she and RFK are riding in the back of a hearse with the casket carrying the body of the slain President, after arriving at Andrews AFB, now proceeding to Bethesda Naval Hospital for the autopsy. She and RFK had briefly discussed funeral plans, security issues, etc. She opens the glass partition and asks the driver and the other attendant what they remember about President Garfield and McKinley (who had both been assassinated in office) and neither knew anything about either. (I guess they skipped American History in HS) Jackie asked about President Lincoln and got this response-""Didn't he win the Civil War?""<br/><br/>So Mrs. Kennedy would decide to have a funeral that America and world would remember, to hopefully forever preserve a positive legacy of JFK's Presidency so he didn't merely end a footnote to history, like Garfield and McKinley and one must give her a A in this respect. In most polls from the public and historians JFK is rated as one of the great Presidents, even though by any true critical analysis his Presidency should be given an ""I"" for incomplete as his Presidency didn't even complete 3 full years, about 2 months shy, barely longer than such notables as Millard Fillmore and Gerald Ford. His most remembered accomplishment, the Cuban Missile Crisis, occurred partly because JFK had botched the Bay of Pigs invasion a year earlier which may have taken Castro out of power. So what has become most remembered about JFK was his horrific murder in a motorcade in downtown Dallas, leaving a young widow with 2 small children and the subsequent state funeral. I was in 3rd grade at the time and it's the first vivid historical memory I and millions have.<br/><br/>To be interested in ""Jackie"" I think you either have to be a JFK assassination history buff, a Kennedy devotee or someone old enough to have a memory of watching this on TV 50 some years ago. The film is going to sink or swim on Natalie Portman's portrayal, I think she does a good job despite some silly moments in the script. Like after she gets back to the WH alone in her bedroom, when she plays the soundtrack album from ""Camelot"" and between chain smoking, drinking vodka and taking pills, decides to play dress up, alternating between trying on various black funeral attire and some of her favorite gowns she wore at balls hosted at the WH, which we get to see in various flashback scenes. There is some fascinating behind the scenes type of stuff dealing with the political factions of the JFK and LBJ administrations but as I said, you have to have an interest in this sort of thing. The metaphor for JFK's reign as President and ""Camelot"" gets a bit overboard, something which is based on a false illusion promoted by a sympathetic press as ""Camelot"" debuted on Broadway, by absolute sheer coincidence, 1 month after JFK's election. Not sure, but I don't think the Camelot comparisons began till after his death."

White of the former first lady,Jacqueline Kennedy after the assassination of President John F.Kennedy.It stars Natalie Portman who portrays the role of Jackie Kennedy together with Peter Sarsgaard, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup and John Hurt.<br/><br/>The film starts when Jackie was interviewed by a journalist who happens to be Theodore White and takes us to the many events that have transpired during her and her husband's stay in the White House that ended in JFK's assassination. It presents us a peek on the private life of Jackie particularly the sorrow and misery that she has experienced and undergone when her husband was shot in Dallas,Texas and how different people around her tried to comfort her from her brother-in-law Robert Kennedy,President Lyndon Johnson and many others.<br/><br/>Too bad that the film does really nothing to tell her full story realistically as possible as it only tries to recaptures the events that took place and it does not explain what Jackie is all about as a person.Watching this film will not allow the viewers to learn more about her as her character is presented as we know her in documentaries about her for all it does is to recreate the persona and stays away to explore who the person really is. As she would say during the interview,""I maintain the right as to what comes out to the press"",I felt that the movie makers felt the pressure of these words too while shooting this film as we practically know nothing new about her as it does not fully explore her humanity.<br/><br/>What saved it from being a bad movie is Natalie Portman's portrayal.She acted excellently in it.Too bad that she is conformed with a tight script that is too scared to fully tell her character's story and humanity to the viewers.Apparently,a lawsuit from the Kennedy family was probably not a good motivation at all.That is why the viewer is treated to an underwhelming and lifeless film."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","2","24 August 2017"," An exceptional performance from Portman
","Israeli-born actress Natalie Portman has come a long way since her amazing performance as a young girl in the thriller ""Leon"", winning an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in ""Black Swan"". <br/><br/>In this film, she portrays Jacqueline Kennedy in the days between the assassination and funeral of her husband, US President John F Kennedy, in 1963. It is an exceptional representation, affecting the unusual voice of her subject and communicating the horror and pain of the First Lady's experience and her determination to have the funeral she thought appropriate.<br/><br/>This is the first English-language film from Chilean director Pablo Larrain and it is a respectful if, ultimately (and perhaps inevitably), cold work with Mica Levi's discordant score adding to the sense of alienation. As Jackie tells the reporter whose interview is the framing device for the film: ""Don't let it be forgot, that for one brief, shining moment there was a Camelot."""
"barryrd","Null","1","2","5 August 2017"," A behind the scenes look at a great moment in American history
","I recently caught the movie Jackie on Netflix and couldn't take my eyes off the TV screen as it moved from a series of post-assassination interviews to the events that lasted from a Friday to Monday back in November 1963. It took me back to those days as a 15 year old and showed what could have happened behind the scenes as the assassination of President Kennedy and its aftermath unfolded on our television sets. Nicole Portman as Jackie, the President's wife, is totally believable as a woman overcome with the emotion of a sudden family tragedy who planned and executed a nationally televised wake and funeral. She managed to get what she wanted--a funeral where she, JFK's brothers and a hundred heads of state walked in a procession; a suitable location for a grave site; a role for herself and her orphaned children; and a funeral template used a hundred years earlier for Abraham Lincoln. I was impressed with how the movie showed a young woman of 34 who was able to immortalize, against all odds, her love for her 46-year old husband and do justice to the office he held. The solemn and dignified woman we saw on television at the time was going through a living hell in private and we see this in one powerful performance. John Hurt as the elderly and wise priest, who counselled Jackie in her darkest moments was splendid. (The only cleric I had ever associated with the Kennedy assassination was Boston's Cardinal Cushing.) I was impressed with the performance of Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy, the President's confidante and brother, who comforted, restrained and supported Jackie while his own world lay in ruins. Caspar Phillipson seemed a good double for John Kennedy in a short but key role. I was disappointed John Carroll Lynch wasn't given more scope. His performance as Lyndon Johnson didn't show the softer side of this formidable president. Beth Grant as Lady Bird Johnson, a great First Lady, also seemed rather stern. Max Casella as Jack Valenti was Lyndon Johnson's pit bull toward the Kennedys. Billy Crudup as the journalist who wrote Jackie's story for Life Magazine was forceful but fair as he occasionally sparred with Jackie over the story she wanted and which she would carefully control for her public image. At the end, as he loosened up, he admitted the funeral was a great spectacle. This movie adds to our appreciation of that great spectacle."

Well this film offers a fresh interpretation. The acting and direction are all well done, as are capturing the look of the early 1960s.

"TheLittleSongbird","5","1","2","25 June 2017"," Didn't do much for me
","'Jackie' had a great story on paper going for it, based on the aftermath and impact on Jackie Kennedy of one of the most interesting and shocking events in history.<br/><br/>While it does have some great merits, 'Jackie' didn't do much for me, instead leaving me rather lukewarm. On the whole it doesn't do a good job doing a potentially great story justice, feeling rather Cliff Notes and overwrought with very little insight. The best thing about it is the performance of Natalie Portman which is brilliant and was deserving of its acclaim. Portman has never looked lovelier and clearly did her homework, with her performance seeming much more real than just a mere imitation or caricature.<br/><br/>Other members of the cast also fare well, with good performances from Beth Grant and Greta Gerwig and Casper Phillipson does well in his limited screen time. Faring best is the sincere and quite poignant (when reminded that he took this role not long before succumbing to pancreatic cancer) performance of John Hurt.<br/><br/>There are a few good scenes. The footage scenes of the Kennedys is where 'Jackie' is at its most interesting, while the air-plane, mannequin and shopping windows and Malick reference scenes (as agreed with a previous reviewer) are powerful moments. The other most impressive assets are the production and costume design and make-up, beautiful to look at and evocative.<br/><br/>However, not all the casting works. Billy Crudup is stiff and lifeless as a pointless character in scenes that are out of place and confuse the structure of the story. Peter Sarsgaard, normally a reliable actor, is aside from being physically wrong for Bobby at his most wooden. Richard E Grant was odd casting as well.<br/><br/>A big problem was agreed the music score. Too intrusive, far too loud (drowning out the dialogue), dirge-like and repetitive. The only good part was the Cassals piece, speaking as a lover of the cello and having it as my second instrument (singing is my passion). Even my dad (a cellist and conductor) said ""I can most likely write better music than that and I can't even compose!"" For all the work that went into most of the production values, it was cheapened somewhat by some sloppy and haphazard editing with shots that didn't flow that well from scene to scene. Too many close ups too, some serving no point. The direction is pretty insipid, as is the overwrought and half-baked dialogue that is masked by sound quality that vastly favours the music over the dialogue.<br/><br/>Sadly, the slight story also didn't grip. Intimacy is mistaken for tedium and there is very little that's illuminating or new, nothing that we don't know already and the film fails to make the characters interesting (while one cannot fault Portman's performance even Jackie was written in a shallow way).<br/><br/>The interview scenes don't belong and confuse the story structure in the earlier parts of the film. Some other scenes are pointless, especially an overlong and weird scene with Jackie looking very glamorous and behaving neurotically accompanied by the very ill-fitting ""Camelot"", that belonged in a completely different film altogether. Could have done without Jackie being covered in blood, that was far too melodramatic and gratuitous, at least to me. All this felt like padding and dragged the film down.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not awful but didn't do much for me, very mixed feelings. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

You might appreciate the movie just for its bravery, going into material that is by necessity subtle. And uncertain. <br/><br/>What really did Jackie say in that week after her husband's assassination? And more importantly, how did she say it?<br/><br/>This brings us to Natalie Portman, who is everything here. She tires, she gives a difficult role a lot of focus. And it's not completely her fault that the performance ends up being stilted, or unconvincing, or you might say incomplete. She must have studied Jackie's mannerisms, but that's not really a way to excuse their exaggerations here. Slight exaggerations, but this is a movie about subtlety and conviction.<br/><br/>The other historical figures are oddly cast—and I know it's an impossible job trying to cast JFK or Bobby, or even Johnson (who is more convincing when Bryan Cranston does it). And where was Ted? All of these things wear the movie down.<br/><br/>The writing and direction raise questions. They are solid here, for sure, but they also contribute to a slightly lugubrious feeling. It's slow. It forced its obvious weight on us. Chilean director Pablo Larraín may have the disadvantage of not having lived through it (and not being from the U.S., even). Yes, there was a Camelot, and maybe it was created deliberately, but idealism doesn't come in cans. <br/><br/>But back to point one—this is moving, important, amazing material.

They used a smudge pot for the eternal flame until the gas lines were installed IRL.<br/><br/>Very little of this film is historically correct. It evokes sadness because of the subject. Not due to the film efforts. Even worse was the extreme graphic of Kennedy's head wound. Far worse than IRL.<br/><br/>Not recommended.<br/><br/>Any other film on Jackie would be better than this one."

","This movie paints Jackie as prickly and controlling. Her particular hostility toward the writer at Hyannisport is never explained. I didn't find this movie to be as boring as it was hard to watch. Not because of the horrible and sad subject matter but because of the lack of any warmth or empathy in the treatment of it. Also, the overly loud musical score grated on my nerves within the first minute and never let up. It went on far too long in most scenes and was mostly a heavy handed collection of strings that didn't enhance anything. Peter Sarrsgaard couldn't have looked less like RFK and gave such a one-note and muted performance without even attempting a Boston accent. After seeing this movie, if anyone is still interested in the subject, I recommend ""The Kennedys"" a miniseries made in Canada a few years back. It's better that this movie and Katie Holmes as Jackie is WAY better than Natalie Portman."

","A disclaimer, this reviewer's unforgivably limited knowledge pertaining to Jackie Kennedy before watching this biopic only encompasses that she was the wife of JFK and a poised portrait evinces an uncanny physical resemblance of a Jeanne Tripplehorn in her prime. <br/><br/>Under the rein of Chilean director Pablo Larraín, his first venture in wrestling with an American historical figure, his outsider status lends JACKIE a rapier-like sobriety in balancing between a complaisant hagiography and a demythologizing sensationalist. An unconventional approach is the time-frame, unlike most fares of that ilk which often adopt a blanket method to encapsulate its subject's life trajectory within a sweeping time-span, JACKIE revolves only around JFK's assassination, the tragedy precipitates a switcheroo which starts to disintegrate Jackie's composure, she is beleaguered with mounting and daunting personal corollaries (moving out of the White House, arranging the funeral particulars, informing her tots of their father's death, etc.) and emotional aftermath (a bereavement so unexpected and would completely shatter her status quo), not to mention the shock imposed by the grisly horror which she has experienced right before her own eyes. <br/><br/>Noah Oppenheim's trenchant script delves profoundly into Jackie's frame-of-mind during that particular period, and peels off her stately, comely bearing to lay bare the essences, a human being undermined by the post-trauma complex, both rationally and emotionally, for example, more than once, she backtracks on the decision of a grand parade for the cortège, and battles with her own conscience, is that pageantry a right move to preserve JFK's legacy or a vanity project for herself when she still can, since the aureole is doomed to fade after her status delegates from the First Lady to a famed widow.<br/><br/>Setting the film with a frame story of Jackie (Portman) interviewed by a journalist (Crudup) a week after the tragedy, then piecing together the narrative from various fragments before-and-after, Larraín treads light on flashbacks which precede the central snafu, the preponderance of which consists of the black-and-white recreation work where Jackie making an introduction tour of the White House for a television program, her diffident yet elegant, but essentially very much calculated public veneer. Also Larraín, as one might expect if familiar with his oeuvre, doesn't flinch from showing us the brutal violence with utter verisimilitude and has no intention to aggrandize the lovey-dovey schmaltz between a married couple, Jackie barely makes any remarks on JFK in a personal way in the wake of his death, guilt has a knock-on effect on her though, ""I could have shielded for him"" Jackie confesses, but surprisingly, we don't get the feeling it is because her deep love for him other than an onus she fails to commit, because it comes at a point when she ponders upon death by bravely walking side by side with JFK's casket in broad daylight, yet the irony is that after her husband is out of the picture, her collateral position doesn't have enough leverage to put herself on that slate as a worthwhile assassination target. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman, does go off the beaten track to gird herself for a role (that distinguished accent alone is quite an achievement for its own sake) which will stand cheek by jowl with BLACK SWAN (2010) as top feathers in her cup, a full-bodied incarnation deserves every honor she receives, she magically combines Jackie's allure with sophistication, wits with wiles, vulnerability with moxie, never shies away from the ever-dominant close-ups trying to elicit and convey every single shift of Jackie's emotional niceties. Among the support group, Peter Sargaard gets his shine as Robert F. Kennedy, who takes on a contradicting role both as Jackie's consoler and her competitive griever; the late John Hurt strobes in one of his final works to pass wisdom and guidance as the priest and Billy Crudup brilliantly plays against a barnstorming Portman in their battling tête-à-tête. But let's not forget Greta Gerwig, who plays Jackie's confidant Nancy Tuckerman against her usual type of hipster, provides the sole shoulder for her to cry on, and they crystallize a beautiful friendship between women which is not tainted by any venom of the world. <br/><br/>Indie musician Mica Levi's predominantly eerie and spasmodically strident string score is another distinction of this off-kilter biopic, like its reference of Camelot in the story, which brings something earthy and in-congruent in the rarefied air of political import, makes up as an indispensable constituent of Lorraîn's sterling team, which allows JACKIE exude a rare stirring frisson that eludes most biopics of recent years, even for those who are not familiar with its real- life subject."

","I went into this pretty blind, and in hindsight, what a strange concept. I had done no research, and just knew it was a Natalie Portman lead ""biopic"" of sorts. Only once the movie started did I realize this was produced by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream/Black Swan), and I immediately tempered my expectation from ""Classic Jackie O Retrospective"" to ""Dark Post-Assassination Character Study"". Natalie had the mannerisms and accent down pat, and I always love to see Billy Crudup in anything. One thing that I was not as enamored with as much as others, was the score. I found it a little heavy handed and leading, and at many points I found myself inundated with a combo of brash instrumentals and brain matter that was more than unsettling. But it was jarring, and that is often Aronofsky's aesthetic. 7.0/10"

","I am so glad I won a ticket to see this as I would have greatly regretted paying cash to suffer through it. Firstly from my memory of Jackie Kennedy in tele news etc I think Natalie Portman played her perfectly. I'd forgotten how annoying that voice and manner were, but there it was on screen totally brought back to life. The low rating I've given this is for the utterly depressing look at a major moment and person in history. Yes Jackie was annoying but surely there was something positive about her, if so we don't get to see it. This flatness of character was as depressing as the funereal music and the faithless depressed priest (what a lack of comfort for a grieving woman). No-one in this portrayal, even her children, seem to like Jackie, everyone appears to tolerate her, surely there was more to her than that. I feel sorry that for Jackie it seems she was totally defined by her husband in life and in this portrayal at least she is defined by his death and her coping with it. It would have been such a better movie if we had seen beyond this one small moment in her life, it would have been then more worthy of the title Jackie."

"ReganRebecca","7","1","2","27 February 2017"," A cut above
","Jackie is a film that is right on trend with the latest convention of abandoning cradle-to-the- grave biopics for intimate slice-of-life ones. In this case the titular Jackie is Jacqueline Kennedy and the slice of her life we are treated to are the days following the assassination of her husband, president John F. Kennedy. A woman smart enough to know that image is everything, Jackie manages to gather her wits about her enough to fight through her grief and put into place the structure that will ensure that her husband and her own legend, will live on. <br/><br/>The thing that immediately elevates this movie is Pablo Larraín's direction which is frankly excellent. He gets a great performance out of Natalie Portman as Jackie, who's surreal version of the real Jackie Kennedy's voice is jarring at first, but becomes less so as the film goes on. The shots he gets are really, unnecessarily beautiful, and by that I mean that a lesser director wouldn't see the drama of the moment or wouldn't use camera-work as inventive, but Larraín always finds a way. His choice for the scorer, Mica Levin, is pitch perfect. It's not the usual staid sort of music but something quite sinister and nauseating, music that unsettles but never takes over. <br/><br/>All that said, while the techs were all a cut above the usual biopic the more the film went on, the less I enjoyed it and that was down to the script. It's not terrible by any means, but it goes back and forth and back and forth between a handful of settings/conversations. It's very circular (Jackie wants to do something for the funeral, she faces mild opposition, then whoever opposes her gives in). After awhile this formula begins to sag. Also ironically the fact that Jackie was so successful at keeping her husband's legend alive is what undercuts any tension in the film. We may see Jackie furrow her brow at the thought of her husband being forgotten and worry that she'll end up penniless but we know none of that happened. <br/><br/>Still, it's a beautiful film. And though it tries to scratch the surface to give us a little of the woman behind the legend what it really does is further her legend still by reminding us how beautiful, how clever, how poised and how perfect she seemed."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","25 February 2017"," An Enigmatic Rendition Of The Titular First Lady And An Interesting Portrait Of Loss, Grief, Trauma & Legacy
","Powered by an enigmatic performance from Natalie Portman, Jackie paints an interesting portrait of the former First Lady of the United States and is a skilfully envisioned biographical drama that's emotionally dense & involving at times but it is unfortunately marred by its filmmaker's inability to provide a proper structure & uniform flow to its storyline, thus resulting in a fragmented narrative.<br/><br/>Jackie tells the story of Jacqueline Kennedy and covers the ordeal she goes through following the assassination of her husband & then US President, John F. Kennedy. The plot offers a rare glimpse into her well-guarded personality by focusing on events before & after the tragic incident, like her much publicised tour of the White House, JFK's funeral arrangements, and an attempt to establish her husband's legacy.<br/><br/>Directed by Pablo Larraín, Jackie is his first English-language film and although he presents some neat ideas regarding what part to include & which direction to take the story in, he messes it all up by trying to juggle too many subplots at once, thus resulting in unexpected tonal shifts and jarring scenes. The script packs a solid premise but could've used more refinement in order to streamline the whole narrative flow.<br/><br/>The technical department showcase an extensive amount of research in each n every aspect, for all its set pieces & costumes are in tune with the historical accounts plus the grainy camera-work & seamless integration of archived footages do bring an added authenticity to its depicted timeline. And last but not the least, the stinging score from Mica Levi is chilling at first but it turns repetitive after a while and doesn't leave much of an impact.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Jackie features a reliable cast in Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup & John Hurt in what turned out to be his final role. Most impressive of them all is Portman who delivers a truly knockout performance in the role of the iconic First Lady and captures the different shades of her character with panache. The rest do well in their given roles but are easily eclipsed by Portman's stellar rendition.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Jackie had all the ingredients to finish as a thoroughly compelling biopic and works as a powerful vignette of loss, grief, trauma & legacy but all of it might have resonated more had it opted for a simpler plot line instead of jumping from flashbacks to present to flashforwards without any sense of direction. Admirable for its meticulous attention to period-specific details & saved by Natalie Portman's beautifully layered performance, Jackie is nevertheless worth a shot."
"zkonedog","4","1","2","25 February 2017"," Hits A Number Of Great Beats, But Doesn't Add Up To Anything In The End
","As generally a fan of biopics, I was intrigued by the notion of profiling Jackie Kennedy. This film sets about to do that task with aplomb, featuring a quirky soundtrack, great acting, and a few great character beats. However, while watching the credits roll, I was disappointed that the overall experience didn't seem to add up to anything. I really never understood what the movie was supposed to be all about.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Jackie"" is structured around an interview given by Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) to a reporter (Billy Crudup) not too long after JFK's assassination. During the interview, the film flashes back to key points as Jackie is talking about them, from her iconic televised tour of the White House to the day of the assassination, and finally its aftermath with Jackie steadfastly planning the funeral arrangements.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good: -Portman was wonderful as Jackie. There were definitely some very emotional moments in this movie, and they worked for me due to Portman's ability to pull them off. -Some great scenes where the movie re-creates their historical counterpart, like the White House TV tour and the JFK funeral. Almost uncanny how the effects can look so much like the original. -A quirky soundtrack that I felt really worked, including some great tunes from the ""Camelot"" musical.<br/><br/>The big problem with ""Jackie"", however, is that I didn't really understand what the film was all about, or what message was trying to be conveyed. Most of the time, it just felt like a bunch of disconnected scenes instead of a coherent whole. While some of those scenes ""work"" (are emotional/investing), others do not and feel odd.<br/><br/>My exact rating for ""Jackie"" would be 2.5 stars, but I can't even bump it up to an ""okay"" 3 because it was such an odd viewing experience. The acting was solid, the music was interesting enough to rattle around in my brain for awhile, and it even emotionally moved me a couple of times, but everything felt so disconnected and nothing ""took"" in the sense that it made me think about Jackie or the other issues in the film in any new light.<br/><br/>Simply put: I want to like ""Jackie"" more than I actually do, but when it comes right down to it the film just isn't all that good."
"diand_","7","1","2","22 February 2017"," Image and reality
","Here's a director that really grows with every movie he is making and it is very interesting to follow these steps as a moviegoer: Post Mortem was so idiosyncratic that my interest started, In No he explored the technical side of movie-making only to further advance his technical and storytelling skills in the seriously underrated El Club. And after Neruda Jackie can now be seen as his best work to date, for the first time directing a big production with US actors, producers and staff attached. The result is highly interesting, offering exactly what most mainstream movies are missing nowadays: courage and cinematic exploration.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning the impression starts to dawn that something special is done here, combining images of Jackie with reality. What Larraín also does is to make the hand-held camera entering and moving into the personal space around Jackie, to a point where it almost feels inappropriate for the viewer. Jackie's shifting states of mind are in this way well-documented and can be internalized by us, while Portman's outstanding preparation and acting makes this approach work, in collaboration with the cinematography by Stéphane Fontaine, creating what he called ""the sneaky intimacy"". The score by Mica Levi (Under the Skin) creates the eerie, detached atmosphere the movie intends to display.<br/><br/>There are many interesting scenes in this movie, but three stand out for me: The airplane scene just brings over the feeling of loss, desperation, solitude and detachment so well I have never seen anything like this in a movie. In the end, the shots of Jackie watching mannequins and shop windows from the car enhances the idea of her public and private image and is rather powerful. And the Malick reference filmed during golden hour in the end is apt here. Downsides are the Camelot musical and priest parts (not the acting itself by John Hurt BTW), they are overlong and start to undo the unsettling effect of the movie. The more graphic parts in effect also detract some of the power of the movie and were unnecessary additions in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie does a great job by mixing movie shots with real footage of the 1962 White House tour; this game is rather effective. Portman now effectively interprets a performance by a character she is playing, creating the basis for the multi-levelled acting performances she is renowned for. For recreating the tour footage in the movie vintage cameras from the 60s were used, comparable to what Larraín did in No, so the scenes shot in 16 mm could be mingled with the documentary footage."
"Hellmant","8","1","2","17 February 2017"," I've missed seeing Natalie Portman like this in recent years!
","'JACKIE': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The critically acclaimed biopic starring Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy, arguably America's most beloved First Lady ever. The film depicts her life, following the assassination of her husband, John F. Kennedy, in 1963. It was directed by Pablo Larrain (a Chilean director, with little former knowledge on the movie's subject) and it was written by Noah Oppenheim (who also scripted the YA fantasy flicks 'ALLEGIANT' and 'THE MAZE RUNNER'). It was co-produced by Darren Aronofsky, who was originally set to direct the film (and he also courted his replacement). The movie costars Peter Sarsgaard, Billy Crudup, Greta Gerwig, John Carroll Lynch and John Hurt (in one of his final film roles, before his death). It's one of the best reviewed movies of 2016, and it's been nominated for three Oscars (including Best Actress, for Natalie Portman). I found it to be extremely slow-paced, but at the same time it's also very involving and effective. <br/><br/>The film begins shortly after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy (Caspar Phillipson); which is depicted in flashbacks. Jacqueline 'Jackie' Kennedy (Portman) is being interviewed by a journalist (Crudup) about it. Throughout the movie we see two sides of the First Lady; a more elegant and feminine persona, she presented to the public, as well as her more witty and dominant side, that she only showed people in private. We also see how strong she was, in dealing with such a historical tragedy. <br/><br/>The movie is only about 100 minutes long, but it feels like it's a lot longer. It definitely takes it's time developing it's characters, primarily Jackie Kennedy, but in that time I think we really feel like we get to know her. Portman is absolutely amazing in the title role, and I've missed seeing her like this in recent years. She's still one of the greatest actresses in film today, and I think this movie definitely shows why. The film is worth seeing just for her, but it's also an important, and very valuable, history lesson.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ZNHDah5M"

","I saw this movie in total amazement.<br/><br/>The camera is in love with Natalie P., and so are we, as soon as we see her. And she's not without flaws, neither are the Kennedys.<br/><br/>Photography, music and settings are perfect. The haunting music is obsessive, so is this film.<br/><br/>I thought this film would be well made but maybe a tad boring, ""the official story"" but probably having the Chilean star director Pablo Larrain made it more ""alive"". <br/><br/>At times it's tough to watch, Jackie doesn't seem to be doing well, her stiff entourage knows it, sometimes a helping hand helps her out, most of the time she's alone.<br/><br/>My favourite character is the journalist, played with gusto by Billy Crudrup. He knows from the start Jackie will be a tough case, but subsequently, he makes her melt, she is probably looking for a confident, and he gets more that what he came for. His last scene tells a story that will not and cannot unfold. How we want him to ""get the girl"" ;). The journalist is a gentleman, doesn't profit from a damsel in distress. He ""does what he's got to do"". <br/><br/>I thought this would be a film about a historical character, but I feel now it's about the distress of a fragile woman, who doubts, complains to the priest about where God is ""is it in the bullet that hit my husband's brain?"", is vain and stubborn, and wonders what would have been her life had she married an ""ugly, simple man"".<br/><br/>As one of J's greatest quotes, ""people want to hear fairy tales"". This is not, and we are so much the better after having watched it.<br/><br/>The priest gets the best lines, the ones that I'll try to remember for a long time. About the meaning of life, on how much can we expect from it, on how we ALL doubt at dark nights but yet wake up again fulfilling life's routines. <br/><br/>You may want to watch a sunset with your loved ones afterwards. Or dance like J does with her red dress. Or bully somebody with power like Bobby does to Lyndon J. I guess.<br/><br/>Every person is different, yet life is a mystery.

"bilinguru","4","2","7","23 January 2017"," Affectation - NOT Acting
","I should say at the outset that I have enjoyed virtually everything Natalie Portman has done up until this role, but her portrayal as Jackie Kennedy is without soul. The hair, makeup and clothes are perfect, but her breathless attempt to sound like Jackie fails a) because it is so affected and b) because the audience is so distracted by the 'performance' that we are unable to relate to the woman. Not sure who to blame here; but the fault must rest with Portman and the Director for squandering such a long overdue subject for the screen - Too bad. Naturally, an actress as talented as Ms. Portman will have some fine moments here and there, but if you are truly interested in understanding the former first lady, you would be better served watching documentary footage. She was a uniquely humble and graceful person who found herself at one of America's most tumultuous times. It is sad that this production fell into the trap of vanity and lost the grace."
"ThousandsOfFilms","9","2","7","18 January 2017"," Natalie Gives One of the Best Performances of All Time
","This is not a great adventure film or great romance, etc. so some of the reviews have found it boring. However, for myself, who has watched thousands of films spanning the whole history of cinema, Portman's performance is the best and most powerful I have ever seen. The rest of this review references the content of the movie, but is NOT a ""spoiler"" as the more you know about this famous, historic sequence, the more the film will be enhanced – especially Portman's performance. <br/><br/>Jackie was brought up in a wealthy East Coast family and was sheltered from harshness for much of her early life, was very refined, stylish, charming and intelligent – she married into an even wealthier East Coast family. Then as she sat beside her husband in an open car driving through Dallas Texas, a bullet blasted off part of her husband's skull soaking her in blood as her husband lay dying in her lap. <br/><br/>This is dramatic and traumatic enough, but there were many more layers of emotional complexity. Her husband, JFK, was the President of the United States of America. The event was being televised and watched by millions and would be front page news and on TV being watched by 100 million people - mesmerized by and in shock over the assassination of the President. This was also a profound moment in history. I was in my junior year of college at JFK's alma mater and I remember exactly where I was when I heard the news as does most of that generation. <br/><br/>In addition, JFK was the father of her two very young children and he was now gone and they were now fatherless (She had lost two prior children, one to miscarriage and one was stillborn). Jackie's life was completely changed and destroyed in an instant. She and Jack had great dreams about what they could accomplish in office – that also was now gone. She had to plan the funeral of the assassinated President and do it in the context of history and have it be the right legacy for him (and for her). She had to stand and witness LBJ, the consummate Texan, be sworn in as the new president. JFK and LBJ had been bitter opponents during the primaries and they were completely different, but these strong feelings, including LBJ's resentment of Bobby, had to be repressed. <br/><br/>Scene after scene entailed in this incredible period of trauma had many layers of evolving and, different for every scene, strong emotional complexity. The whole Jackie experience is told by Portman's face, her tone, her carriage, etc. and is on target and powerful and amazing. But it helps to know the history. <br/><br/>We tend to forget that Jackie was inherently very shy and reserved. However, it was discovered that when she was on the campaign trail, the crowds would swell so she became a fixture on the campaign and was loved and besieged by the media and more in the media focus, viewed by millions, than any other celebrity except JFK himself - just another layer to be added to Jackie's portrayal. It was her style and charm that inspired the specific, iconic image of Camelot. <br/><br/>She was being forced, by law, to pack up her and her children's things and vacate her home (the White House) to make way for LBJ and Lady Bird. In a way, she had made it her own home as she had orchestrated an extensive renovation of the White House to fully reflect its rich history – her being ""pushed out"" was just another layer of loss and abandonment. <br/><br/>I have seen virtually every Best Actor and Best Actress performance except, ironically, Portman's role in Black Swan. Portman was the center of every scene for 90% of Jackie, much of that was done in close-up or semi close-up and virtually every scene was uniquely demanding and very challenging. In a normal script, it's usually clear that an actor has to portray some specific emotion or even a conflict of emotions and a skilled actor is needed to pull this off. However, this was a real life script with unprecedented complexity and special challenges as described above. I was mesmerized by and riveted to watching Jackie - not even aware it was a great performance until the film ended. I gave the film less than 10 because it was not an epic like Dr. Zhivago, but I would tend to give Portman's performance more than 10."

","It seems whenever December rolls around there comes a usual glut of Oscar contenders which, for better or worse end up dominating your local cineplex, just around the time you're in the mall doing some last minute shopping. These pretty ponies are almost always saddled up with tried-and-true story elements sure to grab some Academy attention whether they be, harrowing true life tragedies, soporifically obvious vanity projects and/or exercises in Hollywood navel-gazing.<br/><br/>Jackie certainly tics a few of those boxes off, bringing you a virtuoso performance by an established American actress playing a real life person, in this case Jackie Kennedy Onassis. Yet Jackie isn't just satisfied giving audiences the Epcot version of what you'd expect. No this movie piles a whole other layer of insight and poise to the Oscar procession this year.<br/><br/>Jackie jumps around, over, and in-between the weeks following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Stoked with uncomfortable closeups and a discordant soundtrack, Jackie's (Portman) POV is exhaustively recounted whilst talking to an unnamed journalist (Crudup). Piece by piece, we cobble together Jackie's mindset after the assassination. The mindset of a bereaved wife and mother complicated by the duties of a public servant, the social pressures of family and administers and her own desire to preserve what became known as Camelot.<br/><br/>The film variegates in a few key scenes, with Jackie introducing a film crew (and the country) to new White House renovations she oversaw years prior. She displays an uncomfortable poise with all the fuss and attention; laboring to make her points clear amid interrupting questions and her own Long Island lockjaw. People who remember the Kennedy Administration no doubt remember her interview/tour of the White House as an introduction - Camelot as a place of legend. Jackie builds, forges and maintains this legend; first during the tour, then during the funeral and presumably at every point in-between.<br/><br/>Yet Jackie is not the story of a callous woman looking to save face - or at least not just to save face. Her controversial plan for a funeral procession through D.C. and burial at Arlington National Cemetery is imbued with a swirl of sorrow and regret which she tries and fails to avoid. ""I could have saved him,"" she says finally. Her grief seems etched in her face like wrinkles of scar tissue. Through Natalie Portman's performance alone, it's easy to make comparisons to the quiet dignity of The Queen (2006) or the dilettantism of The Iron Lady (2011).<br/><br/>Yet Jackie isn't just a solo act. It's a delicate dance between Portman and director Pablo Larrain who's camera invades her world with the intensity of a gadfly. We're close, so close to Jackie and to a lesser extent Robert Kennedy (Sarsgaard) that the walls of gold she builds as protection can't help but depress under the weight of her sorrow and the director's prodding. Larrain, whose previous work includes the fiery docudrama No (2012) uses some of the same techniques here to pierce through the veil of the Kennedy legend. Yet while the events of No were personal to the director, Jackie feels more like a curiosity. A movie whose subject is just out of reach and in some cases being exploited for the sake of good cinema.<br/><br/>What results is a movie that feels like we're an outsider, briefly and suddenly given access to a person's most trying moments. We wade into the wells of sadness, we peek into the bitterness and gasp at the trauma all the while Jackie struggles everyday to find the strength to carry on. She eventually finds such strength, largely through being a keeper of the flame to a complicated political dynasty."

Kennedy (Caspar Phillipson) is on screen, the camera's focus is Jackie. We are following her, and seeing through her eyes. And, in that sense, it never feels like a traditional biopic. Instead, it is a character study of a person who witnesses their husband die in front of them, except that husband also happens to be the President of the United States. We live through her stages of grief, as well as her moments of strength. But what was more fascinating to me was to see her obsession with preserving her husband's legacy. She doesn't want him to fade away into obscurity, and instead actively works to make sure that he will be remembered. It was a really interesting direction to go in, and it made for really compelling character moments."

","It must take some doing the assassination of JFK and reduce to the level of boredom the viewer has to endure for one and a half hours. I really struggled to find a reason the film was made it just seemed to drift along and then end, my wife asked ""Is that it?"" sadly yes. I think Natalie Portman did an OK job with a awful script and the soundtrack was too loud and dreary. I am trying to understand what they wanted to convey, was it that Jackie was pretty much self absorbed? The whole thing just plods along a bit like the scene were she plods through the Arlington cemetery mud. They also missed the moving scene were the son salutes the coffin, this film unfortunately is not worth your wasted time watching it."

Whoa - I was wrong. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman speaks and it's like someone is scratching their nails down a chalkboard. Some have said that her impersonation is pretty good... ugh.

"bert-huys-242-355755","9","1","3","24 February 2017"," Fantastic Natalie Portman
","Wow. Natalie Portman does it again. After The Black Swan she must receive another Oscar for her breathtaking role as Jacqueline Kennedy. Together with Rachel Weisz she is, in my mind, the best actress of the last ten years. And the storyline is also daring, but beautiful. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. Director Pablo Larrain from Chile is an innovative moviemaker (No, El Club, Neruda, ...) After Moonlight this is the best movie I have seen in 2017. You will not be disappointed if you are going to see this movie at the cinema."
"humsp-68802","10","1","3","23 February 2017"," Multiple layers beautifully portrayed by one of Portman's best performances
","Natalie Portman makes us shiver with all the layers of her character portrayed so passionately. Larrain's raw, complex vision of Jacqueline Kennedy is enough to humanize and disclose her as a woman, first lady, mother, wife, public figure, widow. All the closeups captured by the camera bring us closer to the pain, suffering, and disarray that Jackie went through in such a realistic way that we almost forget the presence of the actress in every scene.<br/><br/>The non-chronological sequence of the narrative is clearly purposeful, playing with the mixed feelings Jackie experiences and that end up helping her build the multiple parts she's forced to play during the tragic assassination of her husband, John F. Kennedy. A chronological screenplay would probably destroy that level of depth, even though that's something we see in most of the historical biopics, at least the ones that hold a traditional, outdated narrative structure."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","3","9 February 2017"," Behind every great man, there's a woman... that's not to say she'll always have to stay behind...
","If you asked anyone about the most influential First Ladies, the likelihood that the Top three includes Eleanor Roosevelt, Jackie Kennedy and Hillary Clinton will be fairly strong. But isn't it odd that Jackie was the only one not to be a preeminent political figure? That she stayed only 1000 days in the White House and was mostly remembered for her youth, good looks and taste for fashion? But it's misunderstanding the power of fate to believe it takes historically significant achievements to achieve historical significance. So, on a sunny day of November 1963, Jackie made the acquaintance with destiny when a bullet did the same with her husband's skull.<br/><br/>Pable Larrain's ""Jackie"" is an intimate portrait showing JFK's assassination from Jackie's standpoint and the aftermath from her perspective. It is a short time-line but enough to measure the greatness this frail and delicate woman could reach. Indeed, the film belongs to that category of intelligent biography pictures that don't go all ""once upon a time"" but choose the right period to emphasize the emotional struggles of their protagonists, like Diana's funeral in ""The Queen"" or Nixon's interview in ""Frost/Nixon"". Not all the biography movies need the time spans of ""Gandhi"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"", so Larrain doesn't care much about Jackeline Bouvier or Jackie Onassis, this is the story of Mrs. Kennedy and how she went from that brunette concerned about showing her most dashing smile during the televised White House tour in 1962 to the confident woman who helped American people to get through their most difficult mourning time.<br/><br/>But ""Jackie"" can't do without a few flashbacks, so thanks to a clever editing (although sometimes a little awkward), the film is told in flashback through the infamous interview from Life Magazine one week after the assassination and conducted by a journalist played by Billy Crudup. The interview allows to swing back and forth in a rather elastic time-line and it raises the immediate awareness that this film, of bland and austere look, will be enhanced by the flashy performance of Natalie Portman. Watching the first ten minutes of the film, I understand why her performance was deemed Oscar-worthy right at the release. I had my reservations because she doesn't exactly look like Jackie and being four inches shorter added to her physical vulnerability, but when she's in close-ups and she asserts her doubts and her certitudes, when she shares her pain or sweeps all the rumors and falsehoods with chain-smoking confidence, she's believable.<br/><br/>As Jackie, there are even some 'Black Swan' vibes exuding from the performance as if Portman had an unconscious predisposition for dual and complex personas. And by juxtaposing scenes that take place before, during and after the assassination, you can see the evolution of Jackie without any obligatory narrative-serving transition. First, she's that timid woman with an catching smile, her youth and beauty doing the rest of the job. The day of the assassination, she's in a state of mental confusion, realizing that everyone is already in post-Kennedy mood, obviously Johnson and his wife have other things in mind than the funeral protocol and the only support Jackie can find is from Bobby (played by Peter Saargard). The emotional state of Jackie is conveyed by the very particular score of Mica Levy, which I would qualify as hit-or-miss, the kind to either adore or hate. It didn't bother me, but I don't really get what the fuss is all about.<br/><br/>But I loved every minute of the film when it dealt with Jackie's existential crisis, driven by her husband's terminated existence. The truth is that she never really measured his stature as a leader until he was killed, JFK entered history through his death, and then Jackie probably realized that like Lincoln, or in a lesser measure, McKinley and Garfield, his historical magnitude had deepened and it was her task to befit this greatness she felt like the only one to perceive. And the value of the movie is to show how hasty the funerals were to be, had it not be for Jackie's involvement. And as the process evolves, you can also feel the evolution and the gain in confidence that also transcended her all-smiling aura. The shocked woman with the pink outfit became a solemn, dignified, black-clad widow and mother aware of her responsibilities, among them, transitioning her husband to his new historical status... and herself in the process (albeit, involuntarily).<br/><br/>Larrain's film is less a biopic than a character study and through this portrait of Jackie Kennedy, we realize that sometimes, a shock can build a person. When it comes to history, what kills you can make you more iconic, that's for JFK, but what didn't kill Jackie made her enter history, by contributing to her husband's sanctification. One of the film's leitmotifs is a song JFK used to love, named ""Camelot"" a hymn about the loss and the exhilaration of great achievements. Not that I suspect this was the indirect commentary on our era ""Jackie"" tried to make, nor that there is a point in discussing the accuracy related events since most of the elements of the movie seem to be plausible and the performance of Natalie Portman makes the film all worth to watch.<br/><br/>There are also very captivating dialogues, especially with the late John Hurt, delivering one of his last performances as the priest who'll give a few hints to Jackie about the impenetrable ways of God. The heavy omen incarnated by his frail and declining health gives one disturbing but emotional edge to ""Jackie"". I only wish the film wouldn't have eliminated the one scene I waited for: John John saluting his Dad's coffin, that could have been a real emotional pinnacle, but it seems that the focus on Jackie confined to obsession and developing peripheral characters could have highlighted her personality in a more objective, then efficient, way. Still, within its modest budget and short run-time, this was a captivating movie."

","The audience I saw this film with were mesmerized. they sat still and silent in their seats until well into the credits. I know a lot of people won't like this film because it is slow, and the music is not a 1963 soundtrack (but for one song), and its not a sweeping biopic. It is about one very famous woman's life during three horrific days - with a few flashbacks. This is an intimate portrayal of Jackie's reaction and response to the events of JFK's death and burial.<br/><br/>Jackie is a masterpiece. Sarsgaard may not have been the best choice for Bobby and the music was tedious at times... but Portman captured the essence of Jackie. She showed how Jackie was trying to say and do the right things according to her role as the bereaved widow of the president, but simultaneously showed her as a grief stricken widow who wanted to crumble and hide away. I thought the film captured Jackie as a complex vulnerable, controlling, heartbroken, dutiful, drama queen (and I mean that in the best possible way!) She lost her husband, her job, her home - and all in front of cameras for posterity. <br/><br/>The director made some smart choices - rather than duplicating the scene of John John saluting (in that very studied, coaxed way), there is a scene where Jackie is bringing in a cake for his third birthday - the same day as his father's funeral. This is happening as her home is being packed up around her to make way for President Johnson. It is in screen shots like that, and in the extreme close-up of her in the back of the convertible in the moments after the shots were fired that the viewer is left spellbound. <br/><br/>We all know this story from an outside point of view, but this is the first time we see it from the inside."

","There have been a good number of films about one of the most famous assassinations in history, JFK (1991) and Parkland (2013) are the best examples, but this one I knew was going to interesting, from the perspective of the victim's wife, and it was getting attention during Awards Season. Basically Jacqueline Kennedy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Natalie Portman) is the beautiful First Lady, wife of President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy (Caspar Phillipson). The film follows her trauma and the struggles of Jackie, in her personal and political life, in the days immediately after the assassination of her husband. Jackie not only has to cope with her own loss, including consoling their two young children, but the world has been completely shattered by the tragic news, she has to carry the weight of his legacy on her shoulders, and remain dignified and poised. Following the murder of JFK, Jackie watches Lyndon B. Johnson (John Carroll Lynch) sworn in as the new President, makes arrangements for the state funeral, having conversations with John's brother Bobby Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) and the Priest (John Hurt, who tragically died of cancer five days after the film's release), and will have to plan for her departure from the White House. These events are seen in flashback, Jackie is living in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, she is telling her story, her memories of her husband and the murder, becoming a widow and leaving her former home, in an interview with journalist Theodore H. White (Billy Crudup) for Life magazine. Also starring Greta Gerwig as Nancy Tuckerman, Richard E. Grant as Bill Walton, Beth Grant as Lady Bird Johnson, Max Casella as Jack Valenti, Sunnie Pelant as Caroline Kennedy, Aidan O'Hare as Kenny O'Donnell, David Caves as Clint Hill, Penny Downie as Janet Lee and Ralph Brown as Dave Powers. Portman is the perfect choice to play the iconic former First Lady, she is very similar looking to the real woman, and is very convincing with all her emotions, there are some good supporting performances also. It is an interesting choice of editing, for the story to be told through an interview, the graphic death of JFK is left until near the end, there are many close-up shots of the title character which certainly get your attention, the events following the death are engaging, and the attention to detail with the costumes is splendid, it is a most watchable biographical historical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Original Score for Mica Levi, and it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Original Music. Very good!"

","Chilean director Pablo Larraín filming practically back to back with Naruda, filmed on his native country about another historical figure. It can't be easy to tackle such famous people as topics, possibly attacking viewers already made up opinions of them. But to do it twice at the same time, and to do it well is quite a feat for any director. <br/><br/>As a director, Larraín is quite political, coming from a political family that doesn't actually agree with his ideology. He short but impressive list of films are very political indeed, especially his most well known being his film, No. This is his first film made in English, and I had an intriguing question as to why a brilliant Chilean director would decide to direct a film about Jackie Kennedy. <br/><br/>He was approached by producer Darren Aronofsky after Larraín's film, The Club took the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival in 2015 and though initially shocked at the idea, after some thought he was eager to make the film about the first most iconic and influential First Lady. <br/><br/>It's covers the following week from the tragic assassination, ignoring very much of the main man himself and being totally focused on the titular First Lady. It displays her courage and vanity, whilst channeling not just hers, but the nation's and beyond's grief for the lost of a great man and husband. Seeing her not just as the First Lady, but as a wife, a widow, and a grieving mother, who, at that moment of grief had to more from the White House, their home, console their two children and organise a funeral worthy of her Husband's legacy showing her love and devotion to her late husband. All of this while dealing with the new and all too eager Lyndon B. Johnson administration and the rest of Kennedy's grieving family, namely Bobby Kennedy played by Peter Sarsgaard. <br/><br/>Were introduced right at the time after the assassination, with who I can only imagine is LIFE magazine's journalist Theodore H. White (Billy Crudup who interviewed Mrs Kennedy at this different time. Larraín brilliantly fleshes out the story with balanced flashbacks of the tragic, horrid moment and Mrs Kennedy's vintage tour of the White House before the event which displays the importance of public image and relations, her fashion and her flamboyant taste and style which done with strong expressionism, using vibrant colour yet still retaining maximum authenticity. <br/><br/>Madeline Fontaine, costume design certain deserves the nomination at the very least, the production as a whole is amazingly executed and put together. Even Mica Levi resonating score is masterful, being quite different, or unexpected, being both sinister and beautiful at the same time using a glissando. Another well deserved Oscar nomination and hopefully a win on both counts.<br/><br/>The casting of Natalie Portman as Jackie was actually a demanded condition of Larraín when accepting to direct the film, and you can see why. Larraín stating that they had to look like the prominent lady. Portman is simply incredible, would be very surprised if she does not receive the Oscar for best leading actress. You can tell she's done her homework studying what footage must have been available to her, giving a performance showing an unknown humanity, a sternness and vanity of Jackie Kennedy. <br/><br/>It does question the state of today's States but without getting political. It's not going to be to everyone's taste, being captivating but not necessarily a riveting drama, however what must be appreciated about this film is the craftsmanship, a visual masterpiece from Larraín coupled with Levi's score and Portman's incredible performance. <br/><br/>The American Camelot: ""a brief shining moment."" <br/><br/>Mention John Hurt <br/><br/>Running Time: 7 The Cast: 9 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 8 Script: 9 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 0<br/><br/>81% 8/10"

A truly laudable international film when you add the parts.<br/><br/>The choice of Richard Burton singing ""Camelot"" from his stage appearances added value to the film ( I found myself comparing the singing to Richard Harris in the film version, which was so colorless in comparison!)<br/><br/>I am also getting to like Greta Gerwig as a minor actress--she was so good in ""Frances Ha.""<br/><br/>Hurt, Sepulveda and Levi ought to have been nominated for the Oscars for their contributions in this film."

","There are more movies about the assassination of JFK than stars. Well, maybe there are not so many but there are indeed quite a few and on the other hand there are not that many focused on his wife, which this film does.<br/><br/>This movie follows Jackie Kennedy in the aftermath of her husband's assassination. We follow her story through flashbacks in an interview she gave to a journalist. It's an interesting way to show the story, instead of going in a linear way you see her giving the interview and then see watch she explain in images. There are some scenes that they look like they were taken of the original tapes made at that time, specially when Natalie Portman is on-screen.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is the movie. She is the actor of this movie and she is absolutely brilliant. At some point you might start thinking if you are watching Natalie or the real Jackie. Her performance is flawless and she is the main to watch this movie. To be a witness of her brilliance. Then there are two important actors in this movie: the outfits that they wear, which are exact replicas of the real ones, and then, of course, the music. The music is what gives you goosebumps when nothing else can. Absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>A good movie to watch with the sole purpose to enjoy a good true story and what we didn't see on TV at that time, the other side of the coin, the other half.

","We have different ways of feeling affinity for stories, and how those stories are remembered beyond one's lifetime is the core of this film. Jackie Kennedy has a sharp, perhaps unprecedented sense of legacy. During the week of her husband's death we see her dealing with grief and a responsibility to her children, but above all, a responsibility to protect her husband's legacy as President and historical figure in the making. She knows that how his is remembered is now up to her. He didn't have time to be Abraham Lincoln. This theme of history pervades, weaving in footage from her Tour of the White House, revealing her efforts to preserve its history and artifacts. Her understanding for the value of the past in the present and future, for the role of the arts in this remembrance, is clear from the start, haunted foreshadowing of what is to come."

","Recreating history: from her home in Hyannis Port, Mass. in 1963--one week after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas--grieving widow Jacqueline Kennedy tells her side of the story to a reporter. But what is the story? Pill-popping, chain-smoking Jackie is angry at God and her in-laws, she's bitter about having to leave her home in the White House for the in-coming Johnsons (whom she is portrayed to feel cold towards), she's confused about her place in the world and her identity, and she is feeling no reverence to her own legacy--she is more concerned with her husband's (when she sees department store mannequins done up in her image, you have to read your own thoughts in Jackie's benumbed expression). It's never easy for a project such as this to completely erase our memories of this era--as well our TV memories, since most of this historical chapter was well-documented on film and has been running on television ever since 1963. Still, director Pablo Larraín, doing careful, fluid work, has done an excellent job setting the stage for Camelot's tragic fall, using quick glimpses of actual newsreel footage to compliment his visual narrative. Star Natalie Portman obviously studied the real Jacqueline Kennedy (her style, her mannerisms, her cadence of speech), and she's successful at conveying the character's inner-turmoil, although nobody on-screen appears to give Jackie much sympathy (was she that much of an outcast in Washington?). Portman and Larrain attempt to give this woman a soul; however, no one knows what really went on behind closed doors, and so scene after scene of Jackie walking through rooms in a daze, drinking heavily and counting out pain pills on the coffee table, have a masochistic feel. When Jackie catches a glimpse of her haggard self in the mirror and freezes, we have no idea what she's thinking--nor how Larrain wants us to respond. This is a beautifully and meticulously designed picture, but an impersonal one--and yet I doubt it could be improved upon. Many filmmakers throughout the years have tried separating the real Jacqueline Kennedy from the image, but she was a fiercely private and enigmatic person. Unless someone comes up with a purely fictionalized characterization (and Mort Fine came close with his screenplay for 1978's ""The Greek Tycoon""), a detached, look-but-don't-touch portrait such as this must suffice. **1/2 from ****"

","I'd intended to pass on this, assuming it would be another soap- opera version of history, like the dire DIANA movie four years ago. But with Natalie Portman Oscar-nominated, it seemed worth seeing – and it is. The scenes recreating JFK's assassination and the state funeral are as harrowing to view now as they were in 1963, and the moments Jackie shares with the children, John Junior and Caroline, are exquisitely poignant. The movie's other main focus is on an interview between the First Lady and a reporter (Billy Crudup) in which she intends to secure her husband's historical legacy. To hammer home the inextricable link between the Kennedy White House and Camelot (Jackie demands the credit for this), we get to hear Richard Burton singing the show's title song – twice (a musical treat!).<br/><br/>Portman's portrayal of the widow in the historical scenes is flawless, a woman forced to share her grief with the cameras and the Johnson Administration staff. In the interview scenes Portman alternates between insecurity and a kind of imperiousness that made me think she was channelling Helen Mirren channelling Elizabeth II. The tour of the White House renovations she did for television in 1961 is reconstructed, with Jackie all nervy and breathless and reminding me (how ironical) of Marilyn Monroe. Peter Sarsgaard makes a believable Bobby Kennedy, mainly required to be a shoulder to cry on. Caspar Phillipson is a good look-alike for Jack in the historical scenes, although Billy Crudup also has a degree of resemblance to the President, which I found disconcerting.<br/><br/>I'm going to be the Grinch of the Season and say that, although this film does considerable justice to its subject, I don't think it deserves to win awards, but then I feel the same way about LA LA LAND, which is clearly heading for glory."

","""As you have heard, and/or expected, Natalie Portman is sensational as Jackie Kennedy, nailing the former First Lady's mannerism, characteristics and accent to the point where you have to double- take whether moments are archive footage of the real Jackie or filmed as part of Portman's performance. It's commanding and engaging at all times, translating into a moving and sometimes harrowing performance that demonstrates the struggles of being both a mother, wife and figure of inspiration to many; essentially, she plays a lady who has, for a good part of her life, put on a performance, meaning this gives Portman an opportunity to showcase a more personal side to Jackie, including her relationships with a variety of people, be that her family, friends or government officials. It's carefully crafted and finely tuned with a strong possibility that this will go down as one of her career-defining performances, Oscar trophy or not. Surrounding supporting players, despite being incomparable to the name-above-the-title, help round the picture off with solid performances that support the emotional journey the film takes us on; Greta Gerwig is an terrific choice as Nancy Tuckerman, Social Secretary and friend to Jackie, as if Peter Sarsgaard's Robert Kennedy, including one pivotal scene in which he mediates on whether JFK's legacy will simply be that of an assassin's bullet.

"sol-","Null","1","3","17 January 2017"," Iron Lady
","As per 'The Iron Lady', this is not a straightforward biographical drama but rather a stream of consciousness style movie that flips between timelines while examining Jackie Kennedy with a particular focus on the events immediately preceding and following her husband's assassination. While the narrative is framed by an interview with a reporter, all other time periods are very much blurred. This approach occasionally makes the film difficult to follow, but it certainly gets inside the title character's mind as she processes both the aftermath of the assassination and the event itself, questioning and self-doubting whether she could have done more to help her husband and prevent him dying. Clocking in at around 100 minutes though, the film feels incredibly long for what it is and rather repetitive with much of the screen time dedicated to Jackie's decisions regarding funeral procession arrangements for her husband. Whatever the case, Natalie Portman hardly ever hits a false note in the lead role. Some have criticised her performance as very mannered, but that seems very much on point: she is a public figure, constantly forced to put on a certain face with the smallest of moments (wiping JFK's blood off her clothes and face) all that is needed to suggest depth beyond the mask. The film also benefits from another haunting, moody score by 'Under the Skin' composer Mica Levi and archive footage is well spliced throughout. 'Jackie' is not an easy film to sit through and may have worked better at half its length, but it definitely resonates in the mind afterwards."
"gbill-74877","1","1","4","11 September 2017"," Awful
","Ugh. What a disappointing movie this was. The storytelling is awful. The script, which has Jackie and Bobby saying ridiculous and vain things shortly after the assassination, alternates between inauthenticity and cliché. The movie's scope is so narrow – it's titled 'Jackie' but we learn very little about her, since it focuses on her redecoration of the White House and the assassination and its aftermath. That's it! And even then, director Pablo Larrain somehow manages to botch it. He gets Jackie's spirit wrong, and manages to take one of the most dramatic events in American history and make it feel melodramatic. He doesn't give us anything about the larger context of her life, Kennedy's Presidency, or America at the time, and even in trying to tell us what he does, inexplicably leaves out the indelible image of JKF Jr. saluting his father at the funeral.<br/><br/>As for the film's vaunted acting, I found Natalie Portman uninspired as Jackie, and Peter Sarsgaard insipid as Bobby. Neither comes close to pulling off what are admittedly difficult roles. The dialog between Jackie and the priest (John Hurt) is banal and cringe-inducing. The interview with reporter (Billy Crudup) is as well. I am loathe to write extreme reviews particularly when on this site you see maximum ratings for simply good or mediocre movies, or the reverse, decent films getting trashed. I am also into historical films such as this and frankly, normally adore Natalie Portman. And yet here I am, utterly annoyed and giving 'Jackie' an extremely low rating. This could (and should) have been a far, far better movie. How insulting to the Kennedys, and to history."

","This movie received 3 Oscar nominations, and I am having a hard time finding another actress who gives us the kind of performance that Natalie Portman does here. I was also very impressed with the movie's score by Mica Levi which really set the grime tone of the story in the movie. What we have here is something that may be unique movie-making. It takes a well-known and well-covered story of the Kennedys and focuses it on Jackie, herself. <br/><br/>As one watches this movie, one realizes that--after 50 years with countless articles, movies, and documentaries about John F. Kennedy, his family, his administration, and his assassination--we still didn't have anything that focused in on Jackie and what she had to suddenly endure in front of the whole world. Here, we see Jackie striped bare and alone. Accented by the dysphoric chords of the movie's score, we see Jackie as a famous person with no one to really lean on. The camera constantly shows Jackie as an isolated, often silly, figure trying hopelessly to make sense of her role in the drama unfolding around her. What should she do? How can she help to make the Kennedy legacy last and be understood in the most positive way? <br/><br/>While Bobby (Peter Sarsgaard), does make an appearance in the movie, he does not seem to always understand what SHE is going through: packing up the belongings of the White House so that the Johnsons can movie in; taking care of the children; and making decisions about the funeral. <br/><br/>This is clearly Natalie Postman's movie, and although you may not like her vocal cadence and tone, you see and hear a person trying to maintain a sense of dignity in a private world of chaos. As Jack Valenti (Max Casella) moves into the White House, Jackie becomes a stranger in a strange world. <br/><br/>The late John Hurt is also featured in this movie as Jackie's priest who tries to help her makes sense of life. Although his part is small, it is important to the story."

","I've always had a huge interest in history, and remember being so enamored with learning about American history. One of the events that have always captivated me was the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and all the circumstances surrounding the event. I always try to watch whatever I can related to JFK and the Kennedy's. As soon as I saw the trailer for this film and heard Natalie Portman would be portraying the lead, I had a great interest to see it. I love Natalie Portman and always will try to see whatever she is in. I enjoyed hearing how she was garnering Oscar buzz and had to see the performance myself.<br/><br/>Having seen bits and bobs of Jackie Kennedy giving the White House tour, I'd say Portman does quite a good job and portraying Jackie's accent and the way that she speaks. I'm pretty sure she did her homework and it showed, as at times she just disappears into the role. I've seen most of the Oscar nominated films of the year and I'd say Portman may be very close to a lock for her second Oscar. What I really liked about the film is that its scope is limited to just a few days after the death of JFK. Thus you get to view Jackie at her most pained and vulnerable. Once again, I think Portman's portrayal makes the film. As Jackie walks around aimlessly in the halls of the White House you can she how disheveled and exposed she is (although she still must maintain appearances).<br/><br/>The first thing you will notice about the film is the score, which opens the film. Its hard to describe, but the score is a mix of dissonance and something of harmony. Its almost like an instrument trying to play a cheerful tune despite being broken, and its really powerful. Its a truly wonderful and pained score. The films narrative is interjected with events of the assassination, Jackie's White house tour, the events after the assassination and her transition out of the White House, and the interview by Theodore H. White. I didn't care how or when it was done but I thought it was vital to show the shooting and the events with JFK on Jackie's lap while the car was rushing away. I'm happy to say Pablo Larrain does not shy away from this event and its shown in its brutality (which is necessary).<br/><br/>There's a lack of things going on as the film has a limited time frame but the intention is to place the microscope on one of the most beloved figures in American history during the toughest transition of her life. It feels like a whirlwind at times because you get to see Jackie's life as the first lady and how quickly things changed and how her life turns upside down. I thought Peter Sarsgaard had the look of Bobby Kennedy but not really the speech or mannerisms. I thought Barry Pepper was great at Bobby in that Kennedy miniseries and I was hoping for something of that sort. Had no idea it was Greta Gerwig portraying Nancy Tuckerman until after googling the films cast. Caspar Phillipson looked a lot like JFK in the doses that we seem him.<br/><br/>I'm quite pleased that a film about Jackie Kennedy was made, its a biopic I can get behind, especially with an actress like Portman at the helm. I don't think the film is perfect but it gets key elements right. It was vital to portray Jackie faithfully, show the events of the motorcade, and portray Jackie's vulnerability. The film succeeds on those fronts. In the film Jackie wonders what JFK's short legacy as President would be remembered as and tries to remind everyone that for a brief moment ""it was Camelot"". Its important to see the positives in one of the ugliest events of American history. The film has to go through a lot of sad and ugly moments but is balanced by the grace of Portman's Jackie.<br/><br/>7/10"

","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A magnifcent performance gets sidelined with weak storytelling.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Jackie Kennedy's days immediately following the assassination of her husband.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: There is much to admire in Pablo Larrain's insightful docudrama, Jackie, just as there is much to disapprove of. We focus on the tragic last days of one of as America's most popular and sophisticated First Ladies, Jacqueline Kennedy (Onassis). We follow her ordeal and witness her grief over the assassination of her husband and our country's 35th president. <br/><br/>November 22, 1963. Always fashionably attired, Jackie prepares for that fateful drive in Dallas, dressing in that soon-to-be iconic pink and black Chanel outfit and matching pillbox hat. It signals to the movie-going audience what is to be, as we are helplessly drawn into the series of events leading up to her husband's untimely murder. <br/><br/>Through flashbacks and using her interview with a journalist from Life Magazine as its plot device, the film depicts Jackie as mother, wife, and political figure. It addresses her personal struggles: her philandering husband, Jack (an underused Caspar Phillipson as a perfect doppelganger), her well-to-do marriage of convenience, her stalwart devotion to her children, her image as part of America's royal family, her political savvy and desperation to preserve her husband's legacy.<br/><br/>Jackie Kennedy became an American legend, a symbol of strength and grace. She also led a most uncommon life filled with its share of highs (fashion icon and trendsetter, Emmy winner, advocate of the arts, a successful book editor, a millionaire's wife) and lows (an indifferent marriage, the premature death of both her husband, two of her children, and a stepson, the violent death of her brother-in-law, a fall from grace due to a second marriage and her reincarnation as Jackie O., the target of the paparazzi). In this film, some of this is alluded to, most is ignored due to the director and his screenwriter, Noah Oppenheim, and their decision to limit the scope of this character study. <br/><br/>￼As a docudrama, the film takes numerous liberties in its telling of the tale. Yet the script repeatedly overplays the melodrama. Its non-linear aspects of the narrative structure do not help matters, nor does the choppy editing by Sebastián Sepúlveda which includes archival footage that never seamlessly blends with Mr. Larrain's actual reenactments.<br/><br/>While this bio-pic establishes Jackie's anguish and grief succinctly, there are many missed opportunities. The exposition and details needed to flesh out her relationship to Jack Kennedy just are not there. Much of the supporting characters are underdeveloped. More time is spent on her relationship with her brother-in-law, Bobby, who comes across more kindly and positive than corrupt and malicious as history has indicated. Her adversarial run-ins with LBJ are MIA. <br/><br/>￼In general, the acting is a mixed bag of strong and weak performances, mostly due to the sketchiness of the written supporting characters. Greta Gerwig and Bill Crudup offer fine work while Peter Sarsgaard and John Carroll Lynch are less successful with their impersonations of Robert Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. John Hurt's role as Jackie fictitious spiritual adviser seems to be only a writer's prop into Jackie's state of mind and never is remotely a believable character.<br/><br/>So the film's success rests entirely on Ms. Portman's vivid portrayal as Jackie Kennedy and the actress is a revelation. Ms. Portman's voice modulates from breathy precise diction for the general public and a deeper timbre in her everyday speech patterns behind closed doors. The actress captures her quiet inflections and public mannerism while investing in all of the emotional upheaval of a woman in mourning. It is a remarkable achievement in acting and deserves to be recognized.<br/><br/>￼What makes this film so riveting, besides the towering performance of Natalie Portman in the title role, is the behind-the-scenes feel of the film. Perhaps the film's most telling concept is the tell-all depiction of Jackie herself and her calculating desperation to control her private and personal world. The actress daringly allows her character to be unlikable. Her obsession to create a Camelot existence and its dreamlike quest for an Utopian fantasy becomes the thing dreams are made of. It not only legitimizes her husband's fame and historical gravitas, but hers as well and the film brings off this aspect very well.<br/><br/>￼Great care has also been taken by the director to replicate the real life characters and events of the era. Mr. Larrain gives his film style and substance, convincingly echoing the personas of the Kennedy clan. The hair and make-up design and period costumes by Madeline Fontaine are meticulously rendered and make Mr. Larrain's images more recognizable for any moviegoer. The production design by Jean Rabasse completes the overall effect. However, Stéphane Fontaine's photography becomes too artfully heavy-handed with severe in-your-face close-ups. Even more off-putting is Mica Levi's score which is made up of loud dissonant high-pitched chords that produce a strangely eerie sound that would be more appropriate in a science fiction / horror movie genre than in a historical biography.<br/><br/>￼Jackie is a flawed but literate retelling of a woman of the edge, trying to make sense of the chaos spinning around her. It boasts of the the best performance of the year. See it to appreciate two great women as one, Ms. Portman and Mrs. Jacquelyn Kennedy. It is well worth the visit."

","A person who goes to great lengths to create a myth is probably not going to be very thrilled when the veil on that myth is lifted. Not even when it's speculation.<br/><br/>The lifting of the veil itself can be either true or false  accurate or inaccurate  that ultimately doesn't matter. It's the fact that someone lifted the veil that's the issue.<br/><br/>In short, most myth makers don't like to be exposed.<br/><br/>But Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died quite some time ago, so no one has to worry about her anger or possible retribution.<br/><br/>Given that, let's talk about Pablo Larrain's film ""Jackie,"" shall we? The Chilean director does a masterful job of looking at what might have been Jackie Kennedy's experience during the days of and immediately following the assassination of her husband, President John F. Kennedy.<br/><br/>It's a flashback, fast-forward treatment of Mrs. Kennedy and how she crafted the whole ""Camelot"" image of their time in the White House.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is absolutely brilliant in the role of Jackie Kennedy. She nails all of the nuances, emotions and conflicts of what Mrs. Kennedy likely experienced during that time. <br/><br/>Of course, we don't know for certain because Jackie Kennedy didn't write an autobiography and she's the ultimate creator - and editor - of the Camelot thing.<br/><br/>But back to Portman. Without question, this is an absolute Oscar-worthy performance. In fact, Portman's performance is an interpretation of Kennedy's stiff and studied performance as First Lady. It's inspired, human and heroic. <br/><br/>May the force be with any future actress who aspires to play Jackie Kennedy. Why?<br/><br/>Not only has Portman totally raised the bar on this role, she has literally shut it down. Her performance soars high above the mere fashion and beauty work of past actresses who simply don't have the chops to pull off this kind of portrayal.<br/><br/>I also love the way screenwriter Noah Oppenheim explores the issues of life and death, love and betrayal and our overall search for meaning. There's plenty of juicy dialogue and skillful layering here aided greatly by Composer Mica Levi's mesmerizing score. The music itself is almost a character in the film.<br/><br/>Also, big shout outs to Peter Sarsgaard who delivers a strong performance as Bobbie Kennedy, Greta Gerwig who is charming as Jackie Kennedy's secretary Nancy Tuckerman, John Hurt who is especially profound as the priest, Caspar Phillipson who is great in what amount to a few JFK cameos and Billy Crudup who is careful and tactful as the journalist.<br/><br/>Finally  you know  we're living during a time when everyone is so image-conscious. We're spending way too much time crafting and honing our exteriors and almost no time at all working on our inner cores. <br/><br/>If you work on improving your character, your image and legacy will take care of themselves. Despite your adversity, everyone will know the truth.<br/><br/>The vast majority of journalists out there merely want to get to the truth of things. It's not our job to help you craft ""your image"" or create a myth for you. That's the job of your publicist. It's our job to crack through the nonsense.<br/><br/>Many people these days don't like journalists because they want journalists to be ""on their side."" That's NOT the job of any good journalist  although granted, these days, that's getting harder and harder to believe. A good journalist tells a truthful, objective, fair and balanced story  come what may.<br/><br/>In this film, Jackie knows the truth all too well, but she was so busy crafting the image of Camelot along with keeping the nation emotionally afloat. This film itself sort of plays the role of journalist by lifting the veil on Jackie and getting closer to what was probably the truth about her during those days.<br/><br/>When you reveal the messy, sloppy, dirty, muddy, bloody, trouble-filled truth about your life, believe it or not, you actually put yourself on the fast track to martyrdom. <br/><br/>Ironic isn't it? I mean, who on this earth can't relate to a trouble- plagued life? Nobody gets out of this unscathed.

"tye1138","8","1","5","22 December 2016"," 'Jackie' is far better then a normal bio pic.
","'Jackie' is far better then a normal bio pic. <br/><br/>The story of Jackie Kennedy during the days after the presidents assassination, isn't exactly the kind of movie I'd normally be interested in. However, Natalie Portman playing Jackie Kennedy, french filmmaker Pablo Larraín and the stunning use of Super 16 to bring the audience back to 1963, were enough to peak my interest. 'Jackie' in of itself is a very simple story and from what I can tell, is completely true and told mostly in her own words. The filmmakers used many devices to tell the story, all of them pretty unique and interesting like the re-creation of old live broadcasts and the use of original 16mm footage from events around the capitol post assassination. The filmmakers did a brilliant job showing the confusion and depression that followed the assassination, making it realistic and heartfelt. Natalie Portman was outstanding in her (hopefully) Oscar-winning performance portraying Jackie. It's been years since I've seen someone play a person in history so well. Not only did she talk just like her, but she even looked like her. I was convinced from the first frame to the last frame, which is very impressive. <br/><br/>Technically, the film was just brilliant. The use of S16 (retaining the formats 1.67:1 aspect ratio) was fantastic. The film wasn't very grainy/noisy, but it did look as if the film was underexposed slightly because it looked very flat, without a lot of dynamics. The filmmakers were obsessed with the ""single"" shot during any dialog scenes. This technique helped them get right into the emotion of whoever was talking. I felt the lens choices were also spot-on, using a lot of the same focal length except for some well-placed zooms that worked so well. At one point, with the very unique score whaling in the background with a long zoom shot, 'Jackie' felt almost like a Kubrick film. The sparse score felt like something out of 'There Will be Blood' rather then a normal bio pic. This was to intensify the confusion and it worked very well, I just loved the score. <br/><br/>As my analytical mind chewed on the film I noticed, there wasn't a single scene that felt out of place or unwanted, every frame was necessary to tell the story and the use of ""floating"" time, helped keep it interesting. I was impressed the filmmakers re-created much of the White House on a soundstage somewhere in Europe, rather then use the sets here in the states. Most of the film was shot in France, which seems like an exorbitant expense, but I gather it was necessary for some reason, maybe due to financing. Filmmaking wise, 'Jackie' was a lesson in how to tell a very simple story without letting it bore the audience. It's a character study and unfortunately, it's about someone don't even know about. The film itself is about Jackie trying to make the American people remember John Kennedy and in a lot of ways, the film exists to remind people who Jackie was. <br/><br/>I loved 'Jackie' and not because I'm some film snob, it's because the filmmaking within the movie was so well done. It's rare to see such GOOD filmmaking in main stream theatrical movies. Portman has two hands on the Golden Globe and Oscar for her role, nobody can touch her heartfelt and perfect performance. It's sad because there are so many great performances this year, but I think she's got it in the bag. <br/><br/>8.5/10 4 stars out of 5."
"tajacob-11716","9","1","5","14 December 2016"," Natalie Portman will win for best actress at Oscars!
","Natalie Portman easily gives a performance that is just as nuanced and in depth as her black swan performance. In all of the Oscar baity movies I have seen thus far, she has given the best performance of any actress this year and will mostly likely go on to win her second academy award for best actress. The film itself was terrific and haunting all at the same time. My only fear is that the film will only be acclaimed at the awards times for the lead performance and nothing else.Greta Gerwig's performance must be noticed for its commanded resonance. Pablo Larraín's tight direction also adds to the feature. The film also carries striking cinematography. The deft script penned by Noah Oppenheim who was previously a producer for the today show will hopefully score some points this year. Overall, I must admit I had no expectations going into the film, mostly because I had never seen any of other work for this filmmaker, and because Natalie Portman is rather iffy for me. I loved her in Black Swan and love her in this movie. Overall definitely worth someone's time who loves beautiful period dramas with outstanding performances."

","""Jackie"" leaves a mark, yet it might not be what the film makers expected. It feels like a passionate project, with pretty impressive depictions of the era, with cinematography that gives you the feel of the era, or at times, a documentary, realistic look. This is a positive. Also, we have a remarkable movie score which is going to haunt you there and for days after you attend the film. The best part of the film is probably Portman's turn, a much better turn than the one in ""Black Swan"". Although she looks very little like the first lady, she conveys with much passion the turmoil and insecurities after the tragic day. To balance and put some light in the film, we're treated to a ""tour"" of the White House, and how it became a type of Camelot while the Kennedy's lived there. Still, we see the film, understand, and appreciate it; however, I'm not sure that I really enjoyed the experience. I wasn't touched, as much as I was jolted by the recreation of that day, and there's very little subtlety in the film. After a while, we feel like we are being pounded, and we end up a bit drained.<br/><br/>Natalie does a very good job with her intimate approach. She's intense and able to give us an idea of what it feels to be a public figure in good and bad times. She's after all a human being who was apparently a contradiction to herself. Since she appears to love the spotlight and benefits of the good times, it's quite a shock to learn that she doesn't want much of what comes with the position. When the reporter comes to learn about her point of view, she taunts him with lines and appears to know what he expects only to kill much of what he needs from her. Alternatively, breaking down and regaining her composure, we see her human side, and the manipulative touches that are not exactly something we expected. She's a smart woman, with professional ties to this reporter, and we wonder what her motivations are for sharing the experiences with him.<br/><br/>For a while, I was deeply engaged by the film, but it started getting monotonous. It didn't lose any quality, but it remained a steady delivery of information, and it began to feel like a boring documentary. It was rescued by some particular moments when the leading actors brought back some intensity to the performances; however, it was not enough to invigorate it and give it the punch it needed.<br/><br/>As a movie, it is a different portrayal of an event, something that has been discussed and analyzed quite a bit. The director managed to put together an artistic piece, a dark immersion into a sad time in history that aimed for more intimacy but never quite got there. In the end, it will be considered a good film. Whether it touched us, it is still debatable."
"classicsoncall","7","1","6","24 January 2017"," ""I never wanted fame. I just became a Kennedy.""
","Oh my, there are two different movies going on here. Millennials watching this picture will by far hail it as a masterful Oscar contender, in particular noting the performance of Natalie Portman. However if you're a baby boomer like myself who was aware of the events as they unfolded on November 22nd, 1963, the movie, dare I say it, is almost a sinful revision of history. I'll get into that in a minute.<br/><br/>I wasn't particularly in favor of the story's framing device using the interview format between the journalist (Peter Saarsgard) and Jacqueline Kennedy (Portman). If this is the way it happened, it would have been a good idea to reveal the journalist's name. But be that as it may, Saarsgard's character seemed almost hostile to me, or at the very least, unsympathetic. A half century ago, a member of the press would have been much more deferential to the former First Lady, and I found some of the reporter's remarks to be crude. For her part, Jackie's domineering attitude was off putting to say the least. In fact, I thought Natalie Portman's portrayal early in the picture came off as forced.<br/><br/>One thing the picture didn't shy away from was Jackie's knowledge of her husband's affairs, but if one isn't aware of his transgressions, the subtlety of those nuances will be lost on the viewer. Stay attentive to her remark about Jack walking into the desert to be tempted by the devil, but always he would return to his family. That's followed by Jackie's rueful response about her husband frequently going astray.<br/><br/>Where I really fell out with the movie was in those parts of the story dealing with the actual events surrounding the day John F. Kennedy (Caspar Phillipson) was assassinated. I mean, even as a kid when it happened, I was aware that the Connolly's were in the same car with the Kennedy's in the Dallas motorcade; in this picture they weren't. During the final leg of the funeral procession with the caisson carrying the casket of the president, young John-John saluted and brought a grief stricken nation to tears with his innocence. It wasn't in here. And where oh where was Ted Kennedy when all of this was going on? Checking the cast list just for the heck of it, I see there was an actor credited as the younger brother, but if he was in the picture, I didn't notice. Pretty poor.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and the grotesque imagery of the President being shot was probably even more graphic than the real deal as depicted in the quite famous Zapruder film of the assassination. Go to Slide #313 of ""Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film"" and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>So to my mind, the negatives regarding the actual history dealt with here outweigh any other consideration I might have regarding the acting and cinematography. With the announcement just today of the year's Oscar contenders made public, I feel some justification there with the film not nominated for a Best Picture. I don't necessarily disagree with Natalie Portman up for Best Actress, but I think she faces a hurdle."
"gingerrdriley","8","1","6","14 January 2017"," Starring Natalie Harborman! Sorry.
","Some films simply embody one emotional state that they explore for the duration of their run time. For Jackie, that emotional state is grief. What does grief look like? How does it change a someone? What does it reveal about who they are as a person? The dual function of this film is to both serve as a study of an emotion and the study of a character. That character of course being Jackie Kennedy. <br/><br/>Since it is a character study and a biopic, much of the quality of the film is dependent on Natalie Portman's performance. No need to worry though, she's excellent. She so completely becomes her character. There are so many quirks and nuances in her performance which compliment her scenes of heightened emotional state, that she completely subverts the sort of caricature typical of the genre. <br/><br/>This is only the second Pablo Larraín film I've seen, the first being No. Larraín clearly has a knack for biopics and the way he merges his own footage with original documentary material so seamlessly is an absolute joy to behold. The extra effort to include shots which mirrors film from the sixties does a lot to bridge the gap between rote history lesson of the Kennedy family and the reality of a suffering of a newly widowed mother.<br/><br/>As much praise as I would like to heap on Larraín, the execution isn't perfect. Some shots have a sort of shaky quality to them which is frankly annoying. I understand that in many ways this film is meant to resemble a documentary, and I wouldn't mind it if this sort of thing was only present in the older looking footage, but there are certain instances in which it feels totally inappropriate and purposeless. This sort of decision was a bit more appropriate for No, where the entirety of the film seems to be meant to resemble a documentary. For this type of narrative however, I think that it would have served the film better to be a bit more deliberate about when the camera is going to shake. <br/><br/>Honestly for the amount of space my grievances took up in this review, the issues I have are eclipsed by the accomplishments of this film. This film is methodical in its exploration of a character and what is perhaps the most difficult time in their lives. The raw emotion on display is heartbreaking and the performance is awe inspiring. If you like great acting, check it out. If you're some kind of Kennedy enthusiast, check it out. Mostly everyone should check it out."

","Natalie Portman may very well win her second Oscar at the age of 35, which has to be close to the age Meryl Streep won her second. Her performance in Jackie is astounding and completely transforming. The movie as a whole is solid, but Portman is the biggest reason to see this in theaters.<br/><br/>Similar to Steve Jobs & Carol last year, Pablo Larraín used 16mm and 35mm film to transport you back to the 60's and give it that grainy stylish feel. And much like those aforementioned films, you are most certainly taken back to that time period. The movie isn't flawless but it succeeds immensely in Larraín's ability to establish the right production design, costumes, dialogue, and cinematography for that time period.<br/><br/>But let's talk about Portman. Sure, she's incredible in Black Swan and everyone loves her in her debut, Leon The Professional among other things, but she's not always the actress I gravitate towards when deciding to watch a movie or not. But Jackie once again establishes her as one of the best actresses working today. The way she commits to Jackie Kennedy's voice and mannerisms is unprecedented. That wasn't Natalie Portman acting, that was Jackie Kennedy. This film focuses solely on her husband's assassination and the events directly following, but it's absolutely Jackie's story. The whole movie rests on Portman's shoulders, and she delivers.<br/><br/>I think my only flaw I had was that at one point the film decides to take a graphically unnecessary approach to the real-life events. It's one thing if the whole film had taken that approach, but it doesn't. It's a relatively calm film, and they all of a sudden throw in some gratuitous gore. I had already felt Jackie's grief and sorrow, & was already invested in every scene up until that point. I didn't need to be shown The President's head be in pieces to be present in the car with Jackie.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is world class acting on display. Portman never veers into an over-the-top performance, which can happen with biopics, and the film is tightly written and directed. It knew what it wanted to tell and it succeeded in doing so. As much as I would love to see Emma Stone or Amy Adams take home the hardware, I think this is once again Portman's year.<br/><br/>+Complete transformation from Portman<br/><br/>+Larraín's visual aesthetic<br/><br/>+Poignancy<br/><br/>-Slightly gratuitous scene<br/><br/>8.3/10"

I thought this was a good movie focusing almost entirely on how Jackie handled herself the day of the assassination. What so many people don't realize is that after the bullet hit, Jackie had blood all over her for the rest of the day. We see the scene at the end of the day where she finally peels off her blood soaked clothes and washes the blood out of her hair. The movie also shows Jackie and how she felt super sad and panic stricken yet she had to pull herself together act ""poised"". She essentially felt lost. She kept thinking she would go to the poor house like Abe Lincoln's wife did. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes that era and has an interest in the Kennedy's. You never see ANY scenes of the rest of the nation mourning and freaking out. You only see what's going on in Jackie's immediate world, in the quiet emptiness of the Whitehouse."

The many contradictions of Mrs. Kennedy are brought to the screen by Chilean director Pablo Larraín (""No"") in his somber, impressionistic portrait of the First Lady known simply as Jackie. <br/><br/>Notably performed by Natalie Portman (""A Tale of Love and Darkness""), Mrs. Kennedy was seen as a tower of strength by a nation in mourning following her husband's assassination in Dallas in November, 1963, but beneath the steely facade, the film shows a woman in considerable psychological distress who was given to bitterness, drinking, sleepless nights wracked by nightmares, and thoughts of suicide. She herself said that she was ""not in any condition to make much sense of anything,"" but still had to take care of two young children, plan for the funeral procession, and be ready to move out of the White House. <br/><br/>The film takes us into the mind of the First Lady, providing a haunting portrayal of a woman in conflict with herself and the usurpers of her husband's legacy. Jackie's guilt feelings about how she could have saved her husband (Caspar Phillipson, ""Love and Other Catastrophes"") from the assassin's bullet, prevent her from feeling like a heroine, yet she is expected to show emotional control and magical powers of inner strength at a time of overwhelming national trauma. Written by Noah Oppenheim (""Allegiant"") and photographed by cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine (""Captain Fantastic""), close-ups of her troubled face bring the viewer closer to her feelings of isolation, the mood of disconnect enhanced by the dissonant score of Mica Levi (""Under the Skin""). <br/><br/>The film moves back and forth between events, opening with an interview with an unnamed journalist (Billy Crudup, ""Spotlight"") modeled after Theodore White. It is the first time we see Jackie asserting control over what history will record. When asked how she would like her husband to be remembered, she pointedly tells him, ""You understand that I will be editing this conversation just in case I don't say exactly what I mean."" The film also depicts her televised tour of the White House in 1961, her talks with a priest (John Hurt, ""The Journey"") who offers her some unpriest-like comments, and her participation in planning the state funeral, modeled on the funeral of Abraham Lincoln in 1865.<br/><br/>Though conflicts arise because of security concerns, Jackie insists that her two children, Carolyn (Sunni Pelant) and John John (Aiden and Brody Weinberg), be at her side during the procession to emphasize the scope of her loss. Through it all the myth of the JFK years begins to take shape and still dominates after more than fifty years. Though Jackie is in every frame, also featured in the film are Peter Sarsgaard (""The Magnificent Seven"") as Robert Kennedy, Greta Gerwig (""Maggie's Plan"") as Jackie's personal secretary, and John Carroll Lynch (The Architect"") as the new President, Lyndon Johnson, whose interaction with Mrs. Kennedy is notable for its coolness. <br/><br/>Jackie is a compelling film that provides an insight into Jackie Kennedy's state of mind and events that are not generally well known, yet does not always reach us on an emotional level. Though Portman delivers a strong performance, perfectly recreating the inflections in Jackie's voice and conveying the elegance of her demeanor, it is often mannered and her authenticity only shows up sporadically. Ultimately, the human being behind the icon remains elusive."
"Hbarker-32233","7","1","6","19 December 2016"," Great, if a bit redundant, showcase of performance and atmosphere
","It begins on a black screen with the keening strings of Mica Levi's score falling precipitously, catching themselves, and then plummeting further – almost an aural equivalent of that pit in your stomach when you get bad news. Director Pablo Larrain's fragmented, stubbornly artsy-fartsy Jackie keeps the off-kilter, seasick feeling going for most of its slim ninety-nine minutes, which stagger around unstuck in time over a few traumatic weeks like a Slaughterhouse-Five adaptation starring the former First Lady. Though this film is being heavily promoted in the end-of-the-year awards derby, Jackie is defiantly not your mother's Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis biopic. I'm pretty sure most people are going to hate it.<br/><br/>For starters, there's not a lot of biographical information in this biopic, which is framed by the recently widowed Jackie's unpleasant interview with an incredulous magazine reporter (Billy Crudup) and immediately launches into larger themes of tradition, storytelling and legacy. Natalie Portman seems to be laying it on a bit thick at first, super-studiously replicating the subject's breathy voice and over-elocutions, until you figure out that this is a performance of a woman giving a performance – which is where Portman always excels. (No surprise that her Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky is on board here as a producer. Both films spin the actress' sometimes crippling self-consciousness into a virtue.) Jackie is only talking to this boor in order to formally present her officially-sanctioned party line about her husband, continually reminding the hack that she'll be the one editing his piece and stubbing out endless cigarettes while adding, ""and I don't smoke."" Chilean bad-boy auteur Pablo Larrain is never as interested in the story he's telling than he is in the stories we need to tell ourselves. His cunningly clever 2013 breakthrough No starred Gael Garcia Bernal as a diet cola pitchman brought in to sell the public on a referendum that eventually freed Chile's people from Pinochet. Larrain's soon-to-be released Neruda also stars Bernal, this time as a hilariously self-mythologizing fed on the trail of the iconic Commie poet of the title, both of them so preoccupied with spinning their own legends they barely get anywhere at all. Most foreign directors have to sell out a little bit and play by the rules when they come to America and work with big movie stars, so I was pleasantly shocked to see how much of a Pablo Larrain movie Jackie turned out to be.<br/><br/>""We've got to get this right, Bobby"" insists Portman to Peter Sarsgaard –probably the least convincing RFK ever seen on film, but hardly a deal-breaker as the movie's already so woozy and impressionistic. A fair amount of the running time is devoted to them planning Jack's funeral, not just logistical matters regarding the size and the scale of it, but also deciding what messages must be conveyed. Typical of Larrain films, appearances determine what becomes history. ""Brookline is hardly a place to bury the President of the United States,"" zings one of the better lines in Noah Oppenheim's too often on-the-nose screenplay.<br/><br/>But first Jackie needs to figure out how to tell Caroline and John-John why their father isn't coming home, and then she has to symbolically do the same for the nation. She's taking on all these responsibilities in a state of unimaginable shock, and the film's traumatized, shattered structure reaches an early climax when Portman returns to the White House in that iconic pink dress spattered with blood. Cinematographer Stephane Fontaine shoots her endless walk down distorted, wide-angle hallways as if it were an outtake from The Shining, all the precious historical artifacts Jackie painstakingly restored now stretched out as a vulgar taunt, with Levi's droning, hypnotic music belching flute sounds like emissions from the Close Encounters starship. (What a bizarre, magnificent score!) Mercifully brief by Awards Season standards, the film still feels like it's spinning wheels sometimes, spelling out the subtext during a long, unnecessary talk with a priest played by John Hurt. Portman's performance conveys so much more between the lines than it does when she's actually reading them (which she's never been great at) and the insistence on shaky, extreme close-ups for dialogue scenes grows repetitive, not to mention aesthetically ugly.<br/><br/>Much smarter and better-engineered is Larrain continually returning to the First Lady's 1962 White House tour broadcast, re-staged on old film stock and smeary early television resolution, eventually intercut with the funeral procession and thereafter, reminding us of all the careful ways in which narratives are crafted, and how important and comforting they can be to our visions of ourselves and the world. Jackie Kennedy learned quickly, on the biggest stage imaginable how to become brilliant at playing her part, and she had to get even better when the story turned into a tragedy."
"IMDB-ReviewerofMovies","1","1","7","1 October 2017"," Racist & Offensive Scene and Awful Movie
","There is a distasteful quick scene whereby the Kennedy children (Caroline & John, Jr.) are in their playroom, at The White House, and there is a rag doll, on a sofa, which is comparable, in look, to a little black sambo rag doll (which is very racist and offensive). Even if that was true and the children had this type of doll, this should not have been placed in the movie because it's a doll and could easily have been edited out without causing a raucous among historians. Other than this, Natalie Portman's portrayal, of Jacqueline Kennedy, was awful as well as the actor who portrayed Bobby Kennedy. The movie did not flow well at all. As other reviewers have mentioned, the attention to many pertinent details, which would have required adequate research, was ignored. Simple things such as the accurate names of buildings, in Washington, DC, during that time period should never be incorrect particularly for a movie depicting the historical events of a President and their family. With the convenience of the internet, much of this research is easily at your fingertips! This movie ""Jackie"" is an epic fail! Truthfully speaking, the Reelz TV Channel series, in which Katie Holmes portrayed Mrs. Kennedy, was far better in every way and Katie really surprised me with her acting abilities in nailing Mrs. Kennedy's mannerisms, look, finesse, emotions, etc. All the other actors were also really good in the TV series and the series flowed very well with great writing."

"VikiLauda","4","0","1","24 January 2020"," Faux Pearls....
","Firstly I must say Natalie Portman is a superb actress, but this certanly was not the roll for her. The problem is that the real Jackie Kennedy was tall & had ooddles of elegance & grace. She spoke American ""Recieved Pronounciation"" (Queens English) which Portman trys so hard to emulate, but fails at every attempt. JK also had gorgeous womanly curves & Portman does not. Portman is far to thin & has ""angles"" rather than curves. The infamous pink Chanel suit almost buries her! However Portman does ""grief & tears"" in character, excellently & she has the most expressive eyebrows in Hollywood. Some scenes were long, down out, boring & in some cases not needed, making the pacing far too slow. The music was also awfull, with an ear-splitting depressive drone used several times, perhaps to remind us ""Hay kids be depressed!"" or something...<br/><br/>In my view this movie falls flat at trying perhaps too hard to replicate those hellish & deeply mournful days after the Assassination of JFK. JK was a strong, willful determained & intelligent woman who had just lost her husband & was absolutely terrified for the safety of her children. Non of this comes across in this film, which is a shame. The only part that had some semblence of accuracy was the Jackie dressing, & drinking heavily to the song ""Camelot"" perhaps as she remembers when they had their White House ""Camelot""...this was relatable, the costumes were good & the 60's period setting was done very well.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is not brilliant, but it is certainly worth a watch as it is not that bad either."

","This movie is about the 3 days after JFK was assassinated, what it was like for Jacqueline Kennedy to lose a husband and the White House.<br/><br/>While watching it I remembered 3 specific TV shows.<br/><br/>-The inside of the White House was very closely rendered as to how the show 'House of Cards' depicted its own version.<br/><br/>-The scene where Jackie realized she was being replaced as the First Lady reminded me of the episode of 'The Crown' where the Queen Mother was struggling with the notion that she doesn't have a say any more after being replaced by her daughter Queen Elizabeth as head of the family.<br/><br/>-The scene where for a brief moment Jackie realized that she herself wanted to hold on to power reminded me of 'Scandal's' Millie Fitzgerald. Even to a certain degree, she might remind of you of Cersei in 'Game of Thrones.' Or Taylor Swift, as to how she is in tune with using her public image to further her own agenda.<br/><br/>Co-actor Billy Crudup confessed that whenever they shared a scene, he was partly acting and the other part watching in awe as Natalie delivered her lines.<br/><br/>Another impressive thing about the film is the use of some actual footage during that time, seamlessly interwoven within the movie. It added to the genuineness the filmmakers worked hard for.<br/><br/>Overall though, I'm not sure if it was intentional that they just wanted to tell a story and be a vehicle for the lead star's acting. Either that or they wanted to remain faithful to how things really played out, opting to keep things simple and not going overboard for the sake of drama and impact. Maybe that's why in the 73rd Venice International Film festival this movie was up for contention for the Golden Lion award but lost out to Lav Diaz's Ang Babaeng Humayo.<br/><br/>Maybe it feels like they fell a little short because they opted to stick to the 3 days of her life when they have an opportunity to tell the life of an icon, but this is definitely a good template to start with for future retelling of the life and times of Jackie Kennedy."

"smoran1968","2","0","1","23 September 2018"," Disappointing on many levels
","As a baby boomer, I watched the JFK assassination unfold on national television. I remember visiting the White House before JFK's assassination. DC felt alive, vibrant, and full of hope. After the assassination, DC was a city in mourning, a cold, wet place in winter. I visited the President's grave site, staring at the ""Eternal Flame"" as servicemen in their Class A's laid their dress uniform caps on the grave. It is difficult to convey to a younger audience how jarring and scary that period of time was.<br/><br/>It is difficult to convey the courage and dignity Jacqueline Kennedy exemplified during that crucial period of time. Her decision to walk the 8 blocks through DC in the funeral procession made us all think, if she can hold it together, we can. <br/><br/>The film ""Jackie"" manages to defecate all over that history. Regardless of what took place behind closed doors, the composure that Mrs. Kennedy maintained through that time, her protection of her children's privacy thereafter, and her decision all through JFK's presidency to keep his extramarital affairs out of the public eye, all speak to her strength of character in protecting the interests of the American public and her family.<br/><br/>In the film, however, she is portrayed as a spoiled dilettante more concerned with her loss of status than the loss of her husband of its effect on her children. She is erratic and irrational, chain smoking as she washes down handfulls of prescription pills with whatever bottle of booze is handy.<br/><br/>Her famous televised tour of the White house is characterized as a vanity project, in which she is made to appear lacking in confidence or poise, repeatedly being coached on camera by her aide to smile, look up, stay on task. <br/><br/>With respect to the film's writers, I watched the televised tour of the White House. You can too -- look it up on You Tube. Make up your own mind about whether Mrs. Kennedy was poised and articulate, or the deer-in-the-headlights, materially obsessed debutante portrayed in the film, whose most significant commentary on the renovation of the White house was ""as long as it's the best.""<br/><br/>There is so much that could have been said or shown about what Mrs. Kennedy endured before, during, or after that horrible week in November of 1963 that would have made this an intriguing and informative film. Sadly, none of it made it to the screen, which might explain the film's lukewarm reception and dwindling viewership.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen ""Jackie,"" don't bother."

","One of my favourite things about watching 60s-era Jacqueline Kennedy giving a tour of the White House, is that the audience is being addressed respectfully. Mrs. Kennedy comes off as an intelligent, thinking human being who warmly expresses her interest in the things she is describing. Watching her speak, I return the warmth and respect.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman manages to parrot Mrs. Kennedy's accent, but conveys little of the intelligence and sophistication. The script, moreover, seems to require one to think Mrs. Kennedy a cold, manipulative narcissist of a woman. Her outbursts throughout the movie are juvenile. She wishes she had become a stenographer, and had married a ""lazy, ugly man"" - apparently because ordinary folks with ordinary jobs are beneath the Kennedys, and never feel grief or pain? <br/><br/>Ms. Portman's character is sly, and reveals that everything she says and does is duplicitous. She evidently has no personality, and neither do any of the supporting characters. They are mere filler, as the camera is otherwise glued to Ms. Portman's face through the five stages of grief: shock, crying, smoking, lying, and self-righteousness.<br/><br/>There was no reason for this story to be re-told in this flaccid way. It is a shallowly written melodrama, bleak and lifeless, at worst exploiting a real tragedy involving real people for a bit of speculative celebrity gossip. <br/><br/>The two stars is for John Hurt's talent - and the soundtrack, which was well done and added some interest."

","Review: Although Natalie Portman put in an outstanding performance, I did find this movie quite boring, and I didn't understand what point the director was trying to get across. I know that Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) had to deal with quite a lot after her husband, John F. Kennedy, was sadly assassinated, and that her emotions were all over the place but this film made it look like she was making irrational decisions, without the guidance and help from others. The whole interview part of the movie, was also slightly annoying because half of what she was saying, wasn't allowed to be published, so I didn't see the point of it. With that aside, the director captured the period very well, and the costumes and cinematography was quite impressive but from an entertainment point of view, it could have been much better. It did show how much Jackie loved her husband, and how the funeral was so important to the American public and his loved ones but I personal think that the movie could have covered different elements which would have been more interesting. I have to commend Portman for taking on such an iconic role, which would have been a disaster if she got it wrong, and she brought deep emotion and intensity to her performance, which made it watchable. I did find her voice slightly annoying and the jumpy scenes, which go back and forth in time, were a bad choice by the director but you do get to see how it was for the first lady, before and after she lost her husband. Average! <br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie was directed by Pablo Larrain, 41, who has made most of his movies for a Chilean market, which is were be was born. He directed Neruda, The Club, No, Post Mortem, Tony Manero and Fuga, which have all gone under the radar, in terms of box office hits. I personally think that he should have called this movie ""How To Plan A Funeral For A President"", because you don't get an in depth look into Jackie Kennedy, who had many different aspects to her life. It was good to see John Hurt, in one of his final roles before his passing, and Peter Sarsgaard (Bobby Kennedy) put in a decent performance but there was way too many elements missing from the film. It doesn't touch the Oliver Stone classic, JFK, which gave a deep insight into the assassination, so I think they need to go back to the drawing board for this one.<br/><br/>Budget: $9million Worldwide Gross: $25million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas, starring Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup, John Hurt, Richard E. Grant, John Carroll Lynch and Corey Johnson. 4/10"

Though I apologize now for that last sentence may make you think the film is more interesting than it actually is. It's just camera shake and awkward moments where a women cries in a pink suit. Though it's not surprising that it counts as entertainment as of 2017, what's sad is it seems to be what some some people actually think is deep.

Moreover, this movie gives the impression to support the silly explanation of Kennedy's death by the only crazy Oswald, which is a bit confusing and surprising given that nowadays, nobody can buy this version anymore.

Never makes you bored but, at the same time, I can't remember a minute where I was enthusiastically watching.<br/><br/>It left me thinking the Kennedy family were so much more than the front they showed - but in a bad way. Jackie was materialistic, and more interested in how she and her husband would be viewed than anything else - sometimes even to the point of exploiting or ignoring her children as she thought fitted the mood.<br/><br/>In clips thought the portrayal looked as if it Oscar flavour but it was the same acting for 90 minutes. And the casting irritated me - Jackie Kennedy was NOT a skinny stick-lady. She was thin. She was a normally shaped woman as was the norm in the 60s. Not skinny or boney. There are plenty of non-skinny women that could have pulled this off. Casting was off.<br/><br/>On the plus side the directing was good considering the lack of real content. 'Jackie' does seem to be different with her kids. But pre-assassination she sometimes seems to be as distant as if he was dead already. Maybe that was planned.<br/><br/>Disappointing film. Alround, to be honest... No special cinematography when it could have made it better. Blame the director I suppose but I'd ask why the producers bothered making this screenplay."
"raydrogers","7","0","1","24 April 2017"," Jackie brings the Queen of Camelot back to life.
","In November of 1963, the nation faced the horror of John F. Kennedy's assassination. The country was left shocked and unsure of what the charismatic and idealistic leader's death would mean for the future. No one was more effected by the assassination than JFK's wife, Jacqueline. She literally held him in her arms; was covered in his blood. It was left to her to define her husband's legacy. Jackie, starring Natalie Portman in the title role, is a film that seems to be centered on the question of what a legacy truly is. While still on Air Force One, leaving Dallas, Mrs. Kennedy is already contemplating the tone that will be set for her husband's final touchdown in Washington D.C. From her choice of burial site at Arlington, to the flip-flop on whether to walk with the casket in a procession through the D.C. streets, Jackie is determined to give her husband the honored place in America's history she feels he deserved. Natalie Portman gives a wonderful performance. Her tireless study of Jacqueline Kennedy's speech, posture and movement pay off in a truly inspired likeness. Portman's work reaches a level of nuance this reviewer feels we've yet seen from the young actress. Portman is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast as well. Peter Sarsgaard portrays a complicated, yet steadfast Robert Kennedy. Greta Gerwig gives great heart to Jackie's life-long friend Nancy Tuckerman. The late John Hurt is rock solid in the small role of The Priest. Expertly directed by Pablo Larrain, the film captures the grace that can rise out of tragedy. Jackie is worth a viewing for any of those interested in knowing arguably our most interesting First Lady."

","Jackie is a biopic about Jackie Kennedy, the former First Lady of the United States. Starring Natalie Portman in the title role, the film is an interesting look into the life of an iconic woman who was something more than the mere wife of the American President.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of her husband President John F. Kennedy's assassination, former First Lady Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) agrees to an interview with a magazine journalist. Throughout the interview, the mourning Mrs. Kennedy discusses how she deals with the grief of losing her husband, the consoling of her children in their time of need, her own faith in God, and the impact her husband's Presidency will leave on history.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman embodies the role of the First Lady with just as much dignity and poise as the real person. This is easily her best acting performance since Black Swan. However, the film's sub par production values and script make it seem more like a History Channel docudrama rather than an actual Hollywood movie. I just wish the film would have explored more of Jackie's life after she had overcome her bereavement rather than just this one moment.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10"
"christian94","9","0","2","7 April 2017"," Pablo Larraín and Nathalie Portman make Jackie emotional, complex and real
","Jackalie portmanteau could be used to describe the results of the tremendous skill Portman put into portraying the iconic Jackie Kennedy. Director Pablo Larraín takes a strong script which focuses on a compelling and complex individual faced with a drama-intense week at the highest level of personal, family and state/world turmoil and makes it visceral with his vision. Portman is pitch perfect and although La La Land is probably my favourite movie of the decade, I am not certain I can say Stone deserved the Best Actress award more than this nuanced controlled breakdown and bravery in face of adversity acting tour de force.<br/><br/>Inventive and risky editing (Sebastián Sepúlveda)and music (Mica Lei) are other key elements to tell this story emotionally and immerse the viewer in the near meltdown. The supporting cast shines on occasion even though Nathalie casts shadows on everyone with her brilliant role. Acting legend John Hurt delivers some soothing and straightforward philosophy as the priest who gets to hear Jackie's deepest fears and secrets - while we see some of the best cinematography from Stéphane Fontaine who has many other great visual pleasers and shockers in this and did marvels in French productions A Prophet (2009), Rust and Bones (2012) and Elle (2016). This will be one of his last role before his death at age 77 two months ago. Peter Sarsgaard who shined in The Experimenter (2015) gives a few good counterpoints and delivers some well-written lines as Bobby concerning his brother's possible legacy.<br/><br/>Watch Bobby (2006) for the rest of the Kennedy story five years later. A completely different but equally captivating multi-layer narrative by Emilio Estevez."
"jcjs333","5","0","1","6 April 2017"," The rating of 6.9 is about right.
","I was blown away by the extraordinary job Natalie Portman did. I put off seeing Jackie because i didn't think Natalie could 'do' Jackie Kennedy. Wow, she had the voice, cadence, movements, gestures, EVERYTHING, down perfectly. Of course , the whole show is a fantasy. Movies are fantasies put on the screen. This show isn't a documentary or even approaching such. John Kennedy was beautifully cast and wasn't heard of much as it should be since the flick is about Jackie. The whole smoking bit was overdone. Bobby Kennedy was poorly cast but he did a good job. A critic here said 'cold' as describing the show. That's good word to describe the whole fiasco. I don't know who the director is but i'm sure he's a 'kid'. Nobody, in the film is 'old enough' to capture the times or people of the times just like the Iraq War generation has no clue what the Vietnam War was like. The Vietnam era has passed and nobody who wasn't alive during that period can feel or understand what we had going then. Youth, and oldsters alike who are 'observing' the Iraq stuff and Afghan stuff are 'far removed' from 'getting involved. The cell phone, Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, digital generation just can't 'feel' and 'think' with 'insight'. They can't even communicate on a 'real level'. I'm so glad i lived in the Bill Halley and the Comets, Chuck Berry times. Back then we 'tuned in and dropped out'. Nowadays, people have 'tuned out and dropped out' and don't even know they are 'out of it'. On one level 'Jackie' is a joke. There's little 'real' about it other than Portman's acting is 'real good'. I didn't even come close to shedding a tear and there was no humor in the flick. The show was a dry , stilted view of the whole time. The walk with the priest was ludicrous. The show honed in a time of Jackie's life we can't come close to acting out on screen. None of us knew what she was like nor will we. Michelle Williams portrayal of Marylin Monroe was awesome but not reality. I love shows about people who we cherished or hated but have always wondered if we don't do them a disservice by trying to 'capture them on screen' by creating this 'unreal' creature planting the idea in others mind that the person, in reality, was anything like their portrayal. Movies are fantasy , made up stories. There's , presently , a boom in Winston Churchill portrayals. I guess i sound sour and old but, wow, from this old duffer's point of view this is a narrow, restricted view of Jackie's life. I wanted the show to be about 'Jackie's life not this one tiny segment of her life where she wasn't herself but showing her when they first got together and her getting together with Onasis. I think Tycoon was a fun romp at what Jackie may have been like. She makes a comment about women and power and 'going to bed' with men which was cute. Gees, the acting by Portman was a great exercise , great self indulgence , a romp , an escape from reality. Only those who lived through those times can understand. Youth nowadays would rather play video games than do anything important such as getting off their bottoms and protesting risking getting hit in the head with a belly club. If during the Vietnam War, we had the same young generation we have now, we'd still be at War. 'Jackie' was fine acting but limited in scope."

","There have been lots of TV series and films about The Kennedy's and Jackie herself, but while this film doesn't cover any new ground it does feature a strong performance from Natalie Portman, who I often think of as an underrated actress, possibly because of her involvement in those 'Star Wars' prequels.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that this film is perfect. There are a few slow moments, and it's crying out for someone else to take the pressure off of Portman, but for the most part this is a good film that deserved the plaudits it gained upon release.<br/><br/>If there were more films like this, I'd go to the cinema more often."
"st-shot","5","0","2","2 March 2017"," Funereal pace, erratic performance buries Jackie.
","With nearly the entire world privy to this historical display of collective grief the film Jackie attempts to get underneath the moment and images burned into the memories of all who lived through those days as well as the countless re-tellings over the last half century. It is not a pleasant portrait of an icon who showed remarkable courage and dignity in the midst of a mind numbing tragedy but it is an uncharted angle that is daring in theory but mealy and imbalanced in the telling.<br/><br/>Centered around that dark day in Dallas and the period of national mourning following, Jackie presents a varied portrait of the President's widow both weak and strong, sober and medicated, profound and petty. As Mrs. Kennedy, Natalie Portman does not shirk from painting the ideal First Lady beyond the public facade as bitter and understandably disoriented much of the time resembling a more dictatorial Nancy Reagan as she stage manages the funeral plans and the legacy of her husband arguing in hush tones with brother in law Bobby and officials while the shady Johnson people get ready to set up shop. Portman's performance sways from perfect to strident displaying the grace and poise she was famed for while mimicking at times the breathy Jackie with lines meant to emphasize the famous voice that gave us a tour of the White House. It is an undeniably interesting take on a fascinating figure but the film relies on how well we are informed of this event and the films most emotionally powerful moment is to be found in the eyes of Caroline being told of her father's death. <br/><br/>Pablo Lorraine's direction remains low key most of the way, milking the assassination a little more than he should but understandable given it is the film's only chaotic moment with the rest of the film submerged in stoicism and deep melancholy. Along with writer Noah Oppenheim he infers that JFK would have saved the world while the Johnson's with few words are visually portrayed as evil, particularly a dour calcified looking Lady Bird played by an actress 20 years her senior at the time. Whether the creators were attempting to draw a comparison between the vitality of the outgoing administration or make a smug comparison to Lansbury's Manchurian Candidate it is an unwarranted cheap shot. <br/><br/>Lorraine is to be commended for not taking the easier highly admired general view of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, instead making her human with the same petty foibles we possess. But in his sober telling he moves too slowly as Portman presents us with an icon that perhaps is impossible to define or want to humanize by replacing deification with speculation. They should have ""printed the legend"" instead."
"Semisonic","6","0","1","1 March 2017"," Not so curious case of one gigantic ego
","Good cinema is not bound to entertain, that's the popcorn movies' lot. Good cinema is, however, bound to fascinate. And not necessarily in a pleasing way. Well, Jackie is definitely not an entertaining movie. But is it at least fascinating? That depends on what you personally expect from the films you watch.<br/><br/>If you expect to experience some strong emotions towards the film characters then Jackie will be the right thing for you. Because the one emotion it is definitely capable of drawing is the mix of disgust and bitter pity for the protagonist. Whether or not the film's portrayal of Jacqueline Kennedy is accurate is not for us to judge, and it's not even important because the only Jackie we have a chance to know is the media icon carved in stone of history. What's important, however, is that such icon, no matter how glamorous, is beyond ugly due to the obsession with her own self. Over and over again, this film makes that painfully obvious. If that was the goal then it's been brilliantly achieved.<br/><br/>But if you expect a true drama, a story that touches you and keeps you enthralled, this film is probably not the right place to look at. That's the paradox of Jackie, because, despite the profound historical depth of the tragedy of JFK's life and death, this film is about something else. John Kennedy is merely a stage for the main performer, the white swan of the White House. But that star is so busy with trying to impress the world and live up to the image of the First Lady of the greatest president who ever lived, that she fails to notice how false those claims are and how stale she is in that never-ending search of her own perfection.<br/><br/>It could've been different. It could've been better if we could see multiple Jackies, one for the public eyes and one more genuine and for the closest ones only. But maybe there never was a genuine Jacqueline Kennedy, and her whole life, day after day, from the morning till the night, was one huge play called ""The First Lady"". If that's true then the film's fault is that it chose an obviously boring person to tell us about. And if it's not so, and there was actually some versatility in that woman, then the film's fault is in a complete failure to grasp it.<br/><br/>Either way, we're left with 100 minutes of a painfully slow showcase of one person's endless ego, wrapped in multiple layers of fake self-loathing and real self-adoration. And, of course, the masturbation to the past and its greatness. Because, if the present was shot down half-fledged, without anything to show for itself, but you already have gotten your hopes so high and your pride even higher, it's the past that your only hope for indulgence lies in. And while we know that the life of the true Jacqueline Kennedy was far from over when that glorious play of hers ended, and that she'd have many more years of glamorous life ahead, there's never a hint at that in this movie. Never a hint at a mere hope for a change. And that inherent staleness, no matter how chic and pompous, is the film's true and only taste. Stale and still, like the air in a crypt the past is buried in, the past we might want to honor but don't really want to recall."
"scott-gregg111","6","0","1","1 March 2017"," Both arresting and odd
","When making a movie, book, etc. about the Kennedy White House you are traveling over a well beaten path. It is almost hubristic to even attempt yet another movie about Kennedy. Yet this movie, in spite of flaws, manages to pull it off. It is not really a biopic. It is not history. As a person who has read ad nauseum about the political working of this Administration, it's triumphs and pratfalls, and it's conclusion in such a tragedy that the nation itself is still dealing with it 50 years later, I found the film hard to handle. ""That did not happen that way."" I would find myself thinking. Or ""He would never have asked that question, nor would she have ever answered it."" <br/><br/>Performances were mediocre with the exception of Portman and John Hurt. Jacki K. had a very difficult voice to hit. She had a public voice and a private voice. She had to control her accent in public like her husband. Listen to the recordings of Jakie giving her 1964 interview to A.M. Schlesinger. I think Portman nailed it. Jaqueline Kennedy was more enigmatic than her husband. She was nearly hermit like in her personal privacy and has left very few clues about her own state in the days right after her husband's murder.<br/><br/>I guess the best way I can summarize this film is that it is a grainy, glaring glimpse, like the Zapruder film, into the creation of the myth of Camelot. It took about 72 hours to create that myth and one interview to codify it into the ongoing mythos of America."

","The assassination of JFK is one of those mythical events in American history on which an infinite number of movies can be based. 'Jackie' is at least the fourth, after JFK, Love Field and Parkland. The viewpoint is original: not so much the assassination itself is the subject, but the way Jacqueline Kennedy handles it.<br/><br/>Pablo Larrain shows many sides of the First Lady, most of which are not very flattering. The movie jumps between different time frames: an interview with a newspaper reporter, a conversation with the family priest, the recording of a televised tour of the White House, and the period between the actual assassination and the funeral.<br/><br/>In all of the viewpoints, Jackie Kennedy is shown mostly as a very vain, self-centred and outright unsympathetic woman. There's no doubt her grief is genuine, but you wonder if Jackie cares more about the loss of her husband or about the loss of her position as First Lady. Immediately after the events, she seems to prepare for her next image: that of the First Widow.<br/><br/>The film shows how she starts organizing the funeral and insists on making it a huge show. Her demands drive the presidential staff crazy, she doesn't hesitate for one moment to put her children on display and her sadness doesn't prevent her to make one cynical remark after another.<br/><br/>Sometimes you wonder how historically accurate everything is. Did Jackie really ask the ambulance driver who takes her and her dead husband to the hospital if he knows who James Garfield and William McKinley are? Are those names of murdered presidents really what bothered her, minutes after her husband was shot in the head? <br/><br/>The film contains some very strong and chilling scenes. The close-up of a tearful Jackie slowly wiping her husband's blood from her face in front of a mirror is extremely intense. So is the scene in which she slowly removes her bloody clothes in one of the posh rooms of the White House. And the scene in which she, days after the tragic events, had to put on a happy face for her son's birthday is also very strong.<br/><br/>One thing that makes this film really stand out is Natalie Portman's acting. Initially I thought she had overdone the accent, but after viewing the historical footage of the televised White House tour on YouTube, I know it's spot on."

It was really good and almost up there with Daniel Day Lewis' Run as Abraham Lincoln in the movie Lincoln and Meryl Streep in her run as Margaret Thatcher in the Iron Lady.<br/><br/>Unlike the Iron Lady, Portman has to give her performance in a film that was actually pretty good. It's amazing what we can do with technology these days as the filmmakers used it wisely to put us in the early 60s during the Kennedy assassination.<br/><br/>What I also liked about the movie was how the music set the tone of the stage the performers were playing in.

The rest of the cast was fantastic, though: Greta Gerwig kind of steals every scene she's in, and Peter Sarsgaard was good as RFK. John Hurt delivers the film's best lines, in truth, befitting his stature as an actor. Beth Grant and John Carroll Lynch did very well as the LBJs. The pacing was just unbearable, though, as the film just moves really slowly, and the editing was mediocre. The scenes are all jumbled out of order (purposefully?), and it takes away from the storytelling on an emotional level.

I haven't ever had the want or urge to learn about that period of American history and as such I didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>First things first; This is not a movie about the killing of JFK (Everyone knows that happened - right?). This is not a movie about Jackie the women (although I do now know a little more about her than what I did). It is a movie about Jackie the Widow and the week or so following JFK's killing.<br/><br/>The movie is unsurprisingly melancholic. I found myself time and again being reminded of Lars Von Trier's film - Melancholia.<br/><br/>The same despair is prevalent, of course it would be given the circumstances surrounding the theme of the movie. But, that is not for me, where the similarities end... The music throughout tells the story on it's own and is used in the same way to set the mood and feeling throughout the film. It is the second best part of the movie...<br/><br/>That brings me on to the best part of the movie, which is Natalie Portman's performance. Now, I have to say, I have never been a big fan of her work, however in this movie she captures what I now believe to be Jackie Kennedy in the immediate aftermath of JFK's death. She has been nominated for an Oscar this year and must be up their with the favourites. Her performance is riveting.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie although slow is apt as it seems to correlate to that time period and again captures the mood of the movie. Stick with it if you are finding it a little tedious, there was a point where I wanted to get up and leave the movie alone.<br/><br/>With that being said, I'm glad I didn't, I'm happy i've seen it - although I'm not sure I'll watch it again. I appreciate the movie, the way the music is used and the Performance of Portman, but at the end of the day, I was bored half way through and not sad when the film ended.<br/><br/>I do now know a little more about the story in general, however I'm not going to go and pick up a book to learn more about any of this period.<br/><br/>It isn't a bad movie, there isn't really a lot you can do with it as it is framed around Jackie the widow in the aftermath of JFK's murder - as mentioned above. It is executed in the best possible way I believe it could have been. Would I have been more interested in the story of Jackie the women - probably. Would I have been more interested in JFK's life with Jackie - I would say so.<br/><br/>If you are interested in this very important bit of American history, then this film is for you.

The writer is Noah Oppenheim and for him it is his third work as a screen writer after ""The Maze Runner"" and ""Allegiant"". More big names worked on this one, such as producer Darren Aronofsky. This 100-minute film is among the bigger awards players this season. Natalie Portman, who plays the title character, has won a lot for her performance and until her loss at the Golden Globes (to Huppert), she was a true contender in the Best Actress category. Even now, a win is still possible, her second Oscar win. The movie is nominated for 2 more Oscars, which shows that the Academy is fond of it. The cast includes other known names like Peter Sarsgaard, Greta Gerwig (in an unusual role compared to what I have seen her in), Billy Crudup and the late John Hurt in one of his final performances. First of all, it needs to be said that this is no Jackie Kennedy biopic. This is a movie that deal with the woman's life in the hours before her husband was murdered and in the weeks after. It is not about her husband. of course, there are scenes that relate more to him than to her, but overall the focus is much more on Jackie. These scenes would be the killing of course (the emotional highlight of the film), the way how his killer gets killed or also some of the political context, like Johnson taking over and references about the Cold War.<br/><br/>But the fact that there are also references about Jackie's two dead children and that she is basically in every single scene of the film show who is the central character here. The movie also really only focuses on what happened after the assassination. Chapters of her like like Onassis are not included. About Portman, I think she was pretty good. I am sometimes a bit undecided when it comes to her if I like her or not, but she deserves the Oscar nomination I think. Not too sure about a possible win though. Looking at how the action depicted in here is already more than half a century old and how all the characters (except the kids perhaps) have died, you can certainly call it a biopic. I think the movie really scores more through informational value and helps you to learn and understand new things instead of really making an emotional impact which also would have been possible. It is as bleak as Jackie's clothes transformation from pink to black in the face of what has already happened. Some parts work very well, some not so much. I am still a bit undecided about a certain historical/mythical reference Jackie keeps making on several occasions about Kennedy's presidency, even in terms of music (""Camelot""). I guess you have to decide for yourself. I myself recommend this movie especially to people old enough that they did not only live in the 1960s when this happened, but were at an age where they still remember it today. These are probably the ones who this film may have the biggest impact on. All in all, I am not wowed by the outcome here, but I am convinced and I think it is worth seeing."
"dierregi","3","0","1","12 February 2017"," Good interpreter, horrible storytelling
","This is a good example of why chronological storytelling sometimes is the best option. The film covers a short time-frame, a single week from the assassination of Kennedy to Jackie moving out of the White House after the funeral. To add some ""breathing space"", the film is interspersed with images from the documentary of the ""guided tour"" of the White House made by Jackie in 1962. <br/><br/>To establish and maintain a proper mood, the story could have followed the events, opening with a short introduction from the first happy days of the presidency, to the making of the documentary. The landing in Dallas, the shock of the assassination, and the nightmarish week of the funeral would have made Jackie's fall from the grace even more poignant.<br/><br/>The film could have been wrapped up by the interview she gave a week after JFK funeral, when she regained a glacial composure. What we have instead is the interview opening the film, with a snobbish Jackie icily answering impertinent questions from a report she herself invited, followed by an endless jumping back and forward in time. Despite of this, the story feels claustrophobic and drags along at snail pace.<br/><br/>Further ruining the film are: too many close-ups of Portman's face; a very long scene of Jackie drinking, smoking and popping pills all alone in a chilling White House that resembles the bedroom in ""2001: a Space Odyssey""; the overbearing, funereal music to underscore the obvious (an assassination and organizing a funeral are hardly happy occasions) and the useless scenes with the religious counselor. Poor John Hurt is given lines of utter triviality, that offers no comfort at all.<br/><br/>It could have been a decent movie, but the editing destroyed it for me. Maybe filmmakers assume that tangled time-lines are the only way to go in contemporary cinema or maybe there is a law I am not aware of against chronological storytelling."
"dsalouk","6","0","1","9 February 2017"," Over ambitious and over glamorised
","Jackie is a straightforward film on Jackie Kennedy's life shortly after the death of her husband, the president of the United States of America. Using snippets of real footage, it delves into her life prior, during, and post the death, and how she thinks, and what she does.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman portrays Jackie Kennedy with incredible gusto, going to great lengths to evoke the trauma that Jackie would have suffered. It is sorrow and pain that Portman paints through her portrayal, and the resulting actions, whether for better or worse. <br/><br/>Jackie is filmed in a very interesting manner; using a lot of close- ups, eerie music, dry and dreary-coloured scenes, and picturesque still moments. Pablo Larrain used music and silence to really drive the concept of death and its affects on all involved. Larrain has brought his own style to an American film that no other director could do without coming across too campy or patriotic. However, Larrain manages a tasteful style that brings elegance, poise, and deliberateness to the role of presidency, and to those who are intimately involved. <br/><br/>However, with all that is said, the film has no clear message or point by the end, and feels needless and unnecessary. The concept of Jackie Kennedy is glamorised and put on a pedestal with no aim. Whilst interesting, by film's end, a feeling of disappointment and emptiness can't be helped. And no lingering affect of any shape is felt by the film, with no poignant message; contrary to the expectation."
"agmoldham","7","0","1","9 February 2017"," Another great Natalie Portman performance
","I have to confess to being a huge fan of Natalie Portman. Ever since Leon I have always been impressed with her acting and choice of movies.<br/><br/>In Jackie she plays Jackie Kennedy reliving the JFK assassination. There is a section of the movie which revisits the TV tour of the White House with Jackie from 1961. After watching the movie I took a look at the real life Jackie and it was amazing just how closely Portman got to the real Jackie. Obviously acting a real life person isn't just about impersonation and Portman brings a whole lot more to the role.<br/><br/>The movie isn't exactly a bunch of fun, so if you are after watching something uplifting you should definitely not watch Jackie. If you are after an insight into Jackie Kennedy and a great acting performance then you should definitely give it a watch."
"archiecm","8","0","1","7 February 2017"," I was very moved by revisiting this tragic event but I wish they hadn't left out the drums.
","I DO remember where I was when I heard of JFK's assassination: sleeping in my dorm bed at University of California, my freshman year at Riverside, CA. Someone woke me up with the news. Seeing the events again brought back sadness. Seeing it from Jackie's perspective gave me a new respect for her. <br/><br/>I have a vivid recollection of the march and the coffin. The drum unit followed with this incredible beat that I never forgot: thump - thump - thump - rolllllllllllllllllllll - thump - thump - thump - rollllllllllllllllllllll - thump - thump - thump - rolllllllllllllllllllll - thump - thump - thump/thump. I am a musician and that beat pattern has stayed with me for fifty-three years. So when they left the drumming out of the funeral march I was very disappointed. I wanted to yell out in the theater, ""They left out the drums!"" Something told me that would have ruined the experience for most of the audience so I restrained that impulse. I wish Lee Oswald had shown a similar amount of control. (If he is the one -- I think I'll research that by reading, ""Ultimate Sacrifice"" by Lamar Waldron and T Hartmann.)"
"manders_steve","6","0","1","5 February 2017"," Natalie Portman is terrific in a thin one dimensional film
","This film tackles how Jackie Kennedy struggled, coped and ultimately survived the days between John F Kennedy's assassination and funeral, with honour and public persona intact, if not enhanced. A few, but intense days, full of conflicting directional pulls from family, politicians, public servants and her own sense of the obligations of her role in US history. <br/><br/>I can't begin to imagine how ghastly this time must have been for her, with the wildly differing needs of her young children, the political machine now headed by Lyndon Johnston, her sense of obligation to instill a sense of the historic significance of the events and the desires of the political influencers, both elected and salaried.<br/><br/>The film implies it is historically accurate, and I think is plausibly so, but some vintage footage (such as of the walked procession, against security staff advice) would have strengthened that claim. A lot of time was devoted to Jackie's then revolutionary openness in the televised tour of the White House, including the agreement of JFK for her leading role, unusual at that time for a woman. This provided substance supporting her acts seeking to provide a sense of historical context for the highest office of the US of A, which is challenging in a sequence of mostly biologically unrelated presidents who serve up to one or two, four year terms.<br/><br/>I heard an interview with a producer or similar of this film just recently who said that if Natalie Portman had said 'no', the film would not have been made. This seems an insightful comment, because without Portman's performance, I don't think we'd have much to talk about. The story period is so short, the role of all other characters so insignificant, and the general level of knowledge of events portrayed so well known that it really reveals little you wouldn't know or guess.<br/><br/>This in my view is the great weakness of this film – despite a leading actress that might just win this year's best actress Oscar, it is a thin, one trick pony."
"Lejink","5","0","1","4 February 2017"," Jackie Woe
","This up-close-and-personal movie wasn't the conventional bio-pic my wife and I were expecting to see. Instead it focuses only on the key moments in the married life of Jackie Kennedy, ex-First Lady of the USA taking as its obvious fulcrum the assassination of JFK by her side on November 22nd 1963 in Dallas.<br/><br/>The narrative employs a well-used Hollywood framing device, that of an interviewing reporter writing a post-assassination article on her, which allows the grieving widow to speak out loud her struggles to handle her own grief, break the news to their two young children, fight for her husband's legacy and determination to live on, even after having to leave the White House with her family under such awful circumstances - in one scene we see her in the White House, even before her husband's funeral witnessing Ladybird Johnson unfeelingly picking out new drapes for when she moves in.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the movie mixes long-range archive footage of the real President and Jackie with jump-cuts to the modern day actors, sometimes shot in sympathetic blurry-TV black and white. Similarly, the non-linear narrative mixes in other pivotal events during her time as the president's wife, most notably the TV special in 1961 where she gives a guided tour of the refurbished White House interiors she personally oversaw, but also her being made to stand next to LBJ in her blood-spattered clothes while he's being sworn in on Airforce One and her determined walk to the Arlington Cemetery from the White House for the funeral. Interestingly, we don't get to see the famous moment when their young son walks up to his slain father's coffin and salutes it.<br/><br/>Less a history lesson than a study in grief, Natalie Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in the title role. She's in virtually every scene, most often in extensive close-up and convincingly portrays the different emotions Jackie Kennedy must have gone through on the day, from shock, through grief, to determination. Although she interacts most with Robert Kennedy (played by an actor who looks and sounds nothing like the original) while organising the funeral what comes through most is her sense of alone-ness as she drifts zombie-like through the seemingly cavernous White House, playing the record of the contemporary musical ""Camelot"" in the background as she struggles to keep herself together.<br/><br/>That said, it is a slow film and it can be awkward for the viewer to look in on such private trauma, plus there's a graphically horrific recreation of the moment of her husband's death. I also felt the background music was far too funereal and overbearing in the extreme. <br/><br/>Nevertheless it's worth seeing for Portman's remarkable performance even if ultimately the film itself suffers from its narrowness and over-intensity."
"TramMatrix3001","2","0","2","4 February 2017"," Only the obvious
","I'm trying to find a word stronger than 'boring'. Indeed, I almost went ni-ni after the first two minutes.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no idea what the movie was trying to say other than that Jackie Kennedy was a dignified, intelligent woman who was beautiful, rich, wore nice clothes, was married to the free world's memorable, handsome young leader in dangerous times, and therefore idolized. But we knew that didn't we?<br/><br/>Oh yes, she's a bit down in the dumps because her husband was gruesomely murdered in public by a brutal killer who was never positively identified. No surprises there.<br/><br/>We've also received a rundown on the management of public funerals with some commentary about how the bereaved can be pushed aside. Or even ignored. Again, no surprises there.<br/><br/>This unnecessary movie had no message of any kind other than what we already know, or could easily imagine, about the effect on the lives of loved ones caused by this murder; this monstrous attack on America.<br/><br/>As for Natalie Portman, who knows how good was her acting? The script was appalling, actually crushingly boring, killing any chance of an Oscar for her, or indeed a half reasonable story."
"phd_travel","6","0","3","24 January 2017"," Natalie is quite right but the movie has some faults
","This voyeuristic but fascinating biopic is worth a watch. This movie is pretty intimate. It shows a lot of detail not shown before in depictions of the assassination and the aftermath.<br/><br/>A more linear sequences of events would have been better. The flashbacks weren't good for the momentum of the story.<br/><br/>Of all the actresses to play her Natalie actually is pretty acceptable. She imitates the whisper like voice but sometimes too much so couldn't make out the dialog. Some actresses in recent years eg Katie Holmes and Ginnifer Goodwin were glaringly out of place. Natalie captures her elegance and her small stature is camouflaged well. The actor wo plays JFK doesn't figure much but looks like him. Something about Peter Sarsgaard isn't right for Bobby - not wiry enough.<br/><br/>One major fault is the film score is loud and obtrusive. Something classical would have been better."
"NDbportmanfan","7","0","4","17 January 2017"," Though Dry at Times, This is Still an Entertaining Biopic
","Jackie is about the the events Jackie Kennedy went through following her husband's assassination. All of this is being written down by a reporter who is getting this first-hand from Jackie in one of her first interviews since JFK's death.<br/><br/>I felt the story had many dry spots in it. I say that because JFK is a well discussed president so the events that associate with him are trivial at this point. What kept me watching were the actors performances. Obviously Natalie Portman is nominated for her role which is well deserved, but the less talked about performance was Peter Sarsgaard. Although I can't say I know much about the Kennedy family; I thought Peter played a great Bobby Kennedy. I felt worse for him than I did Jackie when the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Although the pacing was a bit slow for my liking. I did appreciate some of the longer camera shots especially what transpired immediately after and how she tried to stay together. The sets and costumes were also gorgeous to say the least as everything just fit the time period. <br/><br/>This isn't a movie that you have to go see in the theater, unless your big into 1960's history, or a fan of Natalie Portman (like myself). Jackie seems to be a movie, like most biopic movies, that you would rent and after watching say ""that was rather interesting and compelling"" but wouldn't be willing to watch a second time."
"artmania90","6","0","4","16 January 2017"," The only reason to go is for Natalie
","I feel compelled to begin making bets on this year's Oscar ceremony, particularly in the Best Actress race. In my mind's eye, there can't be a performance that will top Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy. It's calculated and convincing in a way that is undeniable. From looks to voice, what we see on screen is far and away Portman's crowning achievement. The buzz has been entirely around this performance, and having now seen the film, it's easy to understand that it's really a one-woman show.<br/><br/>The story is told in flashbacks (as many historical films do) as an unnamed reporter (Billy Crudup) comes to meet with the elusive Jackie in the weeks after her husband's assassination and her relocation away from the White House. With a temperament that is already biased against publishers that have elaborated about her life to more closely resemble a tabloid, she negotiates the basis for their dialogue and what will and will not be included. Her voice is deep, calm, and her face never breaks from the reporter's eyes. This is not a happy meeting.<br/><br/>""Jackie"" is certainly a slow-paced story, focusing more on character than plot. Through flashbacks, we essentially see the breakdown within the First Family of the immediate aftermath of the shooting. There isn't an 'Oliver Stone-like' scene in which the assassination is played out in graphic detail, and in fact it is shown in barely a few seconds of terror. The story is on Jackie, her inner torments... There are many scenes of her and Bobby Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) speaking in private, debating on the ways to handle funeral arrangements. Jackie researches the funeral procession of Abraham Lincoln, a man who was remembered after his murder in the public's eye. With barely 2 years under his belt, there is worry that JFK will go down in history like James A Garfield or William McKinley, 2 presidents also assassinated and now forgotten.<br/><br/>From 'Black Swan' and now to 'Jackie,' it's easy to recognize the growth and maturation of Natalie Portman the performer. This is a full role, full of nuance and fragility. Within the film, there are contrasting cuts to her famous television tour of the White House, illustrating the renovation and complete overhaul of the famous home's historical artifacts. Portman is never better than these scenes, not only capturing the walk and mannerisms of the famous First Lady, but also her weaknesses and fear of the public's perception of her. Her voice is airy and outwardly 'fake,' but as the film demonstrates, she was a well-researched woman with tact and brain power much beyond those around her. Another moment captures her washing the blood off her face just before Johnson is sworn in. The camera is so close that we can barely see both her eyes in frame. The grief that explodes off the screen is horrifying.<br/><br/>Pablo Larrain, the director who makes his English-language film debut, frames the story as though a dream. Rarely is the camera locked down, and oftentimes we float along with Jackie through the halls of the White House as she realizes that this quite literally the end of one side of her life. Coupled with an almost-experimental film score that so perfectly pinpoints emotional cues, there is certainly skill at a production level that shouldn't be forgotten come Oscar season.<br/><br/>Is the film great? I don't think so. This is a movie made almost exclusively to highlight the skills of our leading actress, pushing story, pace, and drama to the side. The ending itself slowly drags along, scene after scene, almost as though the director doesn't want to look away from such an amazing performance. I can hardly blame him. It analyzes a woman that is so famous throughout America and yet most people probably don't know the first thing about her. There is so much more to this woman than a blood-stained pink suit."
"bellomona","7","0","4","10 January 2017"," Really Interesting Film Depicting Epic Nightmare
","This movie is psychologically difficult from the first jarring notes of the music, which evokes a nightmare throughout. Events told in flashback to a reporter. I didn't buy Natalie Portman as Jackie at first, but she quickly became very convincing as a stand in. Really made you think about the horror she experienced in all the little, practical details -- washing the blood off her face and clothes, being in the White House alone, trying not to lose it, facing her kids, dealing with the stupid things that people say, planning a funeral for the ages. Editing in real film was well done. Brief, graphic depiction of the shooting. It showed how fragile she was as a woman who's facing raising her kids alone, questioning her faith in God with a priest, and how she stepped up on a hero level to be a dignified example for the nation. You leave thinking that if JFK was a special (if flawed) man, he married a woman even more extraordinary."
"ChetXBuck","Null","0","4","6 January 2017"," Great acting. Important subject. Too dark at times. RFK is all wrong.
","Natalie Portman is very good in the lead role and will get lots of acting recognition. The JFK story is amazingly compelling and still has many nuances to his story even though it has been told many times. This is a very different portrait of the era focused on Jackie and Natalie Portman draws an amazing portrait. Peter Sarsgaard is a bit sloppy as RFK and does not attempt the accent nor the charm that RFK is known for. This film paints a brilliant picture, but if differs so much from other known accounts of RFK and the other family members that it seems jaded against telling the real story of the Kennedy's. The film centers around dialogue between Jackie and a reporter narrative that is often awkward, flawed and beyond belief. The film is largely devoid of ""warm"" characters and many of the relationships feel false and plastic beyond reason. Many things are implied here about LBJ, Lee Harvey Oswald and others that leaves you a bit confused about where the film wants you to focus. This could have been a great film, but I will say it was misguided in the way it told the story... too dark, too foreboding and too many dry characters."
"brooks250","7","0","3","5 January 2017"," Not What You expect from a Bio Pic
","Without repeating what others have noted, this is not a sweeping nor insightful biography into Jackie O's life (no pre-First Lady debutante nightlife or Aristotle Onassis aftermath). Instead, we are dropped into an impressionistic swirl of events right before, during and after JFK's Nov '63 assassination. The moodiness and weight of the tragedy are palpable, but the story drags and teases--giving us glimpses of other historical context, then pulling us back to Jackie's chain smoking grief.<br/><br/>Today, Natalie Portman was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance here. And a great performance it is. But be warned that she has a good 60 - 70% of the lines and the ponderous pace makes this one a challenge to stay awake for during a late night showing. However, I'm giving this film a 7 because to his credit, the director does pick up the pace somewhat in the last 15 minutes and tries to tie this emotional endurance test into some kind of meaningful, memorable package."
"monstermayhem32","6","0","8","5 January 2017"," A great performance by Natalie Portman despite flaws
","I will say despite the fact Natalie Portman does some of her finest work as Jackie Kennedy but I felt the film was lacking something, at only 100 minutes, I felt that the film suffered from pacing issues and a weak script, I would have liked tot have seen how Jackie and John meet and how she struggled to cope with her husband death after the assassination and what became of her later on in life. While it was nice to see a different side of Jackie particularly when he attempts to give her children John Jr and Caroline a normal life after Thieir fathers death but I felt like I wanted something more in terms what is about her that people don't know."

","Jackie has looked interesting to me since I first watched the trailer, so I was pretty excited walking into the theater. I was most excited to see Natalie Portman take on the role of Jackie Kennedy, as it looked like some of her best work in quite a while. As I was watching the movie, I forgot overtime that I was watching Natalie Portman play Jackie, instead I really felt that she embodied Jackie. Her performance was amazing, most likely grabbing her a nomination at the Oscars. While this film provides a good story showing what Jackie did after the death of John F. Kennedy, it drags on and has major pacing issues. At times I caught myself checking my watch to see how much time was left in the film. Overall, this is a great historical film with fantastic acting and an in-depth story. With a fix of the pacing, this good film could've been a great one."

","Jackie (2016/V) was directed by Pablo Larraín. This film is about the first few hours and first few days after the assassination of President John Kennedy. His wife, Jacqueline, is faced with the fact that she is now a widow with two young children. Beyond that, the immense authority that she had as First Lady is gone. The best she can do is protect her children, and plan her husband's funeral to be exactly as she wants it to be. Her hope is that the nation will remember his presidency as a time when Camelot was real. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman portrays Jackie Kennedy, and she demonstrates what an excellent actor she is. She doesn't really look like Jacqueline Kennedy, but she's equally slender and she wears her designer clothing with a sense of fashion and dignity, just as Mrs. Kennedy did.<br/><br/>This is, naturally, a sad and discouraging movie. Camelot disappeared and the memory of Camelot was tarnished by later events. The music utilizes the dark sounds of cello or bass--very sad indeed. (Of course, it reflects a very sad time for those of us who lived through it.)<br/><br/>This movie will work well enough on the small screen. However, we saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Note that on December 25th, 2016, The Little was showing Jackie, Manchester by the Sea, Lion, and Fences.

"paul-allaer","8","0","3","25 December 2016"," ""I didn't want fame. I just became a Kennedy""
","""Jackie"" (2016 release; 100 min.) is a movie about Jackie Kennedy. As the movie opens, we are told this is ""Hyannus Port, MA, 1963"", and in fact it's one week after JFK's assassination. Jackie is hosting a report of Life Magazine to talk about her life as the First Lady and what things may be in store for her going forward. From there the movie looks in a non-linear line at various events, not just surrounding the assassination and the subsequent funeral, but also at Jackie's time in the White House (such as when she hosted a TV special in 1961).<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie is the latest from Chilean director Pablo Larraín, previously best known for the Oscar-nominated movie ""No"" a few years ago. Here he tackles the delicate task as a non-America to being us a look at an American icon, and I do mean Jackie Kennedy. As she plans for the elaborate procession and funeral, who is she really doing it for: Jack's legacy? the public at large? herself? When pressed by the reporter, Jackie simply answers ""I didn't want fame. I just became a Kennedy"", wow. The movie is shouldered by the brilliant performance of Natalie Portman, who is in virtually every scene. I found myself pretty much mesmerized by this film, and the outstanding soundtrack, courtesy of UK composer Mika Levi (a/k/a/ Mikachu), only contributed to that feeling. Greta Gerwig is barely recognizable as Jackie's aide Nancy. Peter Sarsgaard plays Bobby Kennedy very effectively. Also kudos to John Hurt as Jackie's priest. The movie's script comes from Noah Oppenheim (""Maze Runner""), and it seems to me he captured the essence of Jackie's delicate personality in the days following the assassination. Portman is already whispered as being the front runner for the Best Actress Oscar, and it certainly wouldn't be stolen if she wins for this.<br/><br/>Jackie has been slowly but steadily getting a wider release, It is now playing on 3 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at on Christmas Day was attended nicely but frankly I had expected a sell-out or something close to it, which it surely wasn't. I've seen quite a few JFK assassination-related movies over the years (including 2013's ""Parkland""), and I can honestly say that ""Jackie"" is truly a new experience of what happened in those days. If you have a chance to catch ""Jackie"", be it in the theater, or on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it. ""Jackie"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","Like many people, I saw this movie at TIFF and have not been able to shake it from my mind. Natalie Portman is just brilliant in this role. She's nuanced, subtle, and completely vanishes into Jackie. Her role in Black Swan is a cake walk compared to the hurdles she had to make it through to pull this one off. Bravura job! Now here's the issue, I think the filmmaking is decent. It's broad and glosses over some very interesting incidents that could have taken the film as a whole to another level. This, of course, is due to the writing. But the performance, art direction, cinematography, and wardrobe really rise above its flaws to create something special."
