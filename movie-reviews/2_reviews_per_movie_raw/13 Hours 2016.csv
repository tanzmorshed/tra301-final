","For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.<br/><br/>I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the facts.<br/><br/>1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require spotters to assist with any corrections.<br/><br/>2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.<br/><br/>3. Hillary's statement that, ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?"" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11.<br/><br/>4. All UAS aircraft are armed. As stated in the movie could have assisted in the defense of the embassy or the CIA compound.<br/><br/>5. General Ham, AfricaCom CC is someone I worked with in Mosul in 2004 for 6-months. Good guy and I know from my experience he would not hesitate to act if allowed. One day he'll give an interview and get his whole story. Can't wait...<br/><br/>Rick274 Colonel (Retired) 274ASOS/CC"

","Benghazi.<br/><br/>In this age of bitter rhetoric, the name conjures all manner of furor and blame. A small stinging wound to honor and prestige - a name to carry hate and zealotry.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, OF ALL PEOPLE, was able to peer into the 2012 attack on US diplomatic and intelligence resources, and capture one hell of a war story. Going into this movie, I expected a number of things. Among them were gratuitous explosions, jingoistic flag waving, and tough-guy tired clichés. I did not get what I was expecting.<br/><br/>Instead, Bay, his cast, and his filmmaking team have brought out a solid, technically informed, faithfully rendered account of those who were caught in the conflagration - how they found themselves there, how they fought for their lives, and how they made it out...or didn't. There's no political agenda here. The only agenda is to show warriors (who are also real people, with cares, and hopes and flaws) engaged in struggle, with all the courage, and luck, horror, and terrible splendor that is timeless.<br/><br/>And in the end, there's no war worship - only somber reflection on the nature of struggle, and what it does to these warriors. This is a clear and worthy work for that. Bravo."
"phd_travel","10","130","177","18 February 2016"," Just put politics aside and watch it
","As polarizing as this movie is just put your politics aside and watch it. The attack is a part of history that deserves to be put on screen in as grand and well produced manner as can be. And in that sense it succeeds. The filming in Morocco and Malta captures a really on location feel. <br/><br/>The battles are well done and engaging, not over the top. It was a bit confusing at times distinguishing the main characters. Maybe they shouldn't have had beards for the movie because it made them look alike. Jon Krasinski and James Badge Dale, Max Martini and Dominic Fumusa are all good as the heroes. There is just enough background with kids and wives shown to put a human element to the people. Whatever your politics is, they were brave. Liked Jon Krasinki's characters statement about dying over there at the end.<br/><br/>The journey under fire from the embassy to the annex was gripping. The prolonged gunfire and mortar attack on the annex was quite scary too. It was chaotic but as long as you kept the 2 compounds separate in your mind it was okay. Initially, a little bit less back and forth between scenarios would have been better. <br/><br/>There are the ""bad"" good guys - the incompetent CIA people especially the chief who gives the infamous and disputed ""Stand down"" order. Wish they had shown a bit more of the Ambassador's death and recovery of his body but maybe it was just too disheartening for the screen. <br/><br/>Some people against the movie are probably just unhappy it was made in the first place. Apart from the stand down and request for air support it isn't too directly critical of the administration. There might not be a way to make a movie about Benghazi that actually could make the haters happy. <br/><br/>Watch this movie."
"dlevans-52743","9","262","376","13 January 2016"," Intense movie, that raises almost as many questions as the answers that it provides.
","I found this movie to be very intense and riveting. The audience seemed to have a need to make an unusual number of trips to the snack bar and rest room and I found myself becoming frustrated by the number of interruptions. The movie is not for the faint of heart, as there are a number of scenes with graphic depiction of injuries. Regardless of your political affiliation, if you have any thoughts about what happened at Benghazi, you need to see this movie. Michael Bay does a great job of portraying what happened. Additionally, with the exception of one individual who s portrayed as not wanting to take action, he does not take the obvious opportunity to lay blame at any single individual in the US government. He clearly portrays a small group of men as heroes. Without their courage and willingness to fight against what appears to be an overwhelming force many more lives would have been lost. I do not often see movies twice, but this movie is likely to be an exception... In closing, if Michael Bay is 90% accurate in his depiction of what happened, our government (the US government), owes a huge debt of gratitude and an apology for their lack of action to 6 very brave men."
"cosmo_tiger","8","82","113","4 June 2016"," The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to.
","""Things change fast here in Benghazi."" Jack Silva (Krasinski) has just been reassigned as a guard for the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. What starts off as a routine assignment changes on September 11, 2012. When a group of insurgents breach the Embassy and attempt to kill the US Ambassador, Jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision. Follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help their fellow soldiers. I was looking forward to watching this, but I was also a little worried at the same time. The story is interesting and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it was directed by Michael Bay. For that reason I was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to. Overall, not just a surprisingly good Michael Bay movie, a good movie period. I give this a high B+."
"ram3973-375-130487","7","32","42","16 February 2019"," Don't Pay Attention to the One-Star ""Reviews""...
","I first saw this film when it opened back in January, 2012. While it's not a ""great"" film by any stretch, it is a solidly good one. It is also Michael Bay's most *RESTRAINED* film (which isn't saying much, but it's a FAR cry better than the last four Transformers films).<br/><br/>But, getting to the title of my comment, when I went back and watched this film for the second time (today, February 16, 2019), I felt compelled to pull up IMDb on my phone during the viewing and I checked out some of the user reviews. I found one thing shockingly in common among all of the one-star ""reviews"":<br/><br/>Not a single one of them had any knowledge of the events of the true incident! And it was painfully obvious that they could not have been bothered to do a little research before making their inane comments public. Many did not know the name of the militant group that attacked the compound (Ansar al-Sharia), and just randomly decided that it must be ISIS. Some felt that it was a condemnation on Hillary Clinton and her actions/lack of actions as the events unfolded (there was not a single mention of Secretary Clinton throughout the entire film, good or bad). One did not even understand why the name of the film is ""13 Hours"" (seriously, did they even bother to actually WATCH the film before adding their ""thoughts"" in a blatant effort to only try to bring down the rating percentage?)!<br/><br/>Is the film accurate? Of course not. When a movie is based on a true event, dramatic license is and ALWAYS has been used to make the film more compelling to viewers. And say what you will about Michael Bay's films, but the guy can masterfully direct action set pieces; each one expertly realized to get the viewer's heart pumping. Here, he does it again and again. Or, more accurately, two straight hours after the first bullets start flying to the bitter end.<br/><br/>It's not a definitive history lesson on what actually happened, but it is decidedly riveting and Bay's most mature film to date. One can only hope that now he's left the directorial duties of the abyssmally and increasingly brainless ""Transformers"" franchise to other people, maybe we can start getting more films like this from him so people can remember what he is actually capable of when he gets material to work with that he takes seriously and treats it as such."
"ThomasMagnumPI","Null","179","279","15 January 2016"," An Absolute MUST See... Michael Bay actually pulled it off!?! A remarkable film.
","Telling this story needed to be done and done right. Amazingly, Michael Bay achieves true greatness with this effort. I'm overwhelmed because no one could have known Bay had this movie in him as a director.<br/><br/>This is a masterful film in almost every aspect and certainly in every way that truly matters. Maybe knowing the real life set up and cover up to these events helps elevate the appreciation of what hits the screen but the film holds up well even if a viewer is unaware of world affairs. The premeditated, brutal attack in 2012 on two United States installations in Benghazi, Libya is a dark chapter in not only the war on terror but in U.S. history in general. Expertly depicting the events surrounding those attacks with such tension and emotion is a credit to this film and those that made it. This includes the remarkable cast who each were superb in their roles. Maybe the first act was a bit long as characters were established and maybe the over use of shaky cam early can be considered technical flaws but when a story is this well told and this well crafted, flaws like that fall quickly by the waste side.<br/><br/>The movie draws you in and makes you feel like you were there on that fateful night. Without getting overly political, it informs the viewer of what happened in riveting detail. It leaves the ""why did this happen and who is to blame"" for the viewer to decide. The courage on display and the charisma of those that serve comes across in a big way. That (along with current political consequences) is reason enough why this story needed to be told. Thank God that they did it justice."
"JayPatton88","8","20","26","18 November 2019"," As a former PMC
","This movie hit home. Every PMC who signs every contract knows they have no US military support. A PMC or grouping of PMC's is on their own. Only a President can order US military action on a foreign nation without the Senate and House Approval. Had President Obama sent in a military for for support or even ordered air support for those PMC's would have made a single handed de-facto declaration of war against Libya, which at the time out armed forces were engaged in military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Adding a third conflict with another Arab state would have over extended US armed forces resources to one region, complicating a difficult situation already happening. I am glad most of those PMC's made it home alive to their families and did exactly what their contract states, solved the situation by themselves. Great movie ,but brought up horrible memories for me. With the facts I presented keep those facts in mind when sitting down to watch this movie or watch it again. ( Once was enough for me. ) Great directing and acting, pretty close to factual. Watch it or rewatch it with the facts I presented in mind and the movie will make a whole lot more sense to the viewer."
"culebrapeak","9","200","325","13 January 2016"," True Heroes
","The overall experience of the World Premiere was incredible, but this Movie in any venue would be worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Like most, I've seen hoards of ""Action Movies"", but the compressed time line and episodic nature of this one puts you into a pressure cooker that leaves you drained at the end. Probably more firepower per minute than in any true life account ever shown on the Big Screen.<br/><br/>In the final moments, though, you realize just how much these men lost. Few if any other team of six would have survived such relentless and massive assaults. But more than anything, it will force you to ask yourself why our government literally left these men and the people they saved, to die."
"GulforDie","9","245","405","13 January 2016"," Riviting Authenticity
","Riveting Authenticity is the first feeling I had when the movie ended. After watching these events unfold. If you don't feel for these real life men, soldiers, heroes, Americans.... You may want to consider a frontal lobotomy. Or just stop reading and/or watching anything political. This work is best viewed after removing the talking points/ talking heads. Only recount the actual time line of events from the Bengasi hearings on c-span. This work gives a mega phone to those who's voices where dismissed and a heart to those who can never speak again. Michael Bay clearly did the right thing by taking direction from those who where actually there. That is evident throughout the movie and really gives a heightened authenticity. One of the best historical war movies ever. Several emotions smack you hard throughout this movie. The acting was very well done by pretty much everyone. John Krasinski probably impressed me the most. I have not enjoyed much of anything he has done since the office. This is a rare film in that I will want to see again. I hope this work can help heal a country that was stabbed in the gut by the attempt to muddle the facts from that day."
"SaritaLW","10","189","318","13 January 2016"," 13 Hour: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi
","I had to give the movie 13 Hours a solid 10. I am a huge fan of true stories and movies that are based off books, especially when the story is filmed true to the real. This thrill riveting masterpiece not only captivated the lives of these six soldiers and the people trapped between this battle between the Libyan rebels, but Michael Bay did an excellent job with his use of guns and sound system that he always does so well. You can't help but stay on the edge of your seats as you hope these brave men all make it to the end of the movie. This movie has non stop violence while these heroic soldiers attempt to rescue the ambassador as well as help the American residents escape. This movie will have you racing against time as we relive this Sept 11, 2012 event also called the ""Battle of Benghazi."""
"xcvb_2003","7","19","28","13 August 2016"," Micheal Bay restricting himself to deliver a straight forward, focused movie. A Thrilling and Entertaining watch.
","This movie is based on a true story about the attack on an American embassy and a secret CIA base in Benghazi, Libya, on the 9/11 anniversary in 2012. And how a few numbers of of Ex-Soldiers managed to repel the attack. <br/><br/>Directed by Micheal Bay, I was surprised to see him holding back his Bay-ism and deliver a straight forward focused film. The story got a long build up at the start, setting up the location, the characters and the situation. And then chaos. What I liked most about this film was the fact that you felt just as lost as the soldiers and people in this movie. The confusion, the chaos, the uncertainty, it was delivered quite nicely, creating tension and thrill. <br/><br/>There are a lot of characters in the movie, but ultimately it is focused on these soldiers, and while the movie could have done a better job developing them, what it did was good enough in a sense that it worked for the movie. I liked em. Acting varied, with some delivering pretty good performances. Also, again with Micheal Bay restricting himself, there were no stupid side plots or cringe worthy romance for any of the characters. They all had families back home and we got some moments with them, humanizing the soldiers more. <br/><br/>The action was solid. It felt raw and realistic. There were the occasional Micheal Bay's firework explosions and some exaggerated RPG moments, but that's about it. Everything else was great. And this is the movie to watch on a home theater if you own one because sound effects were terrific. The explosions, the guns firing, the bullet impacts, it all sounded really great. Soundtrack was good. And the cinematography was great, it was a good looking movie. <br/><br/>The movie strayed away from political stuff, and just focused on the incident, which made me appreciate it more. The underlying message it was trying to give might have been too heavy handed at times, especially at the end, but it was a good one. <br/><br/>My issues with the movie, other than the ones already mentioned, were that the movie was too long. It took about 40 mins for things to get started and while the build up created the anticipation for what's about to happen, it got too long and slow in some areas. 20 mins shorter and it would have been a much tighter and cleaner film. Also, there are some, few, but some cringe-y scenes attempting to add humor, which stand out like a sore thumb considering most of the movie has a serious tone. <br/><br/>All in all, it was an entertaining watch and shows Micheal Bay still can control himself. I hope the dude gives up on Transformers and does other things, like this, more. Shame that this turned out to be his least grossing film. Definitely a recommended watch. <br/><br/>7.8/10"
"Lynnpryor-878-992884","9","64","109","23 January 2016"," Makes a strong statement
","I'm not a fan of Michael Bay movies. So many of his movies seem to be more explosions than plot. I leave the theater reeling from an overdose of special effects. With 13 Hours, though, Bay has delivered a well-done movie. Sure, it's still packed with a lot of explosives, but they are central to the story.<br/><br/>The story centers on the September 11, 2012 attack on the American compound at Benghazi, Libya. The news pundits and everyone with an opinion have been discussing these events for two years. What did the President know? What did the Secretary of State know? What could've been done differently—and why wasn't it?<br/><br/>The movie never asks those questions. The event is presented solely from the perspective of the security detail—the small group of men assigned to the American compound. This is not a Hollywood-ized version of the events like the other big movie out right now. (Revenant is based on a true event, but people and details have been added to enhance the drama.)<br/><br/>So 13 Hours just presents what happens at Benghazi without directly dealing with all the political questions and squabbling. Yet the movie made a strong political statement without ever making a direct political statement.<br/><br/>For example, the CIA in Benghazi stayed in continual contact with the state department and the Pentagon regarding the events as they happened. We see brief scenes of other military bases and military leaders in the Pentagon receiving the news and discussing the events, but they are very brief scenes. And no attempt was made to paint the Pentagon as the bad guys. Back in Benghazi, those on the phones just reported to the others, ""Support is not coming."" The dialogue in the compound included no opinions or reactions to that news. ""WHY AREN'T THEY COMING? DOESN'T THE PRESIDENT CARE WE ARE UNDER ATTACK?""<br/><br/>But because we in the audience have been placed in the compound with the soldiers and CIA, we are the ones asking those questions.<br/><br/>During one of the brief scenes of the news being received at the Pentagon, Michael Bay included a cutaway shot of the White House. No dialogue—just the image. The movie made no attempt to put words in the President's mouth, but by simply showing the White House, Bay communicated the silence of the White House.<br/><br/>That is why I contend the producers made a strong political statement without making one. They didn't politicize what happened, but by simply showing events from the perspective of those in Benghazi, they let the viewers draw their own conclusions.<br/><br/>lynnhpryor.com"
"gmd4462-623-52926","8","126","253","15 January 2016"," Movie critics love to hate
","13 Hours was absolutely riveting, no question. And it raises serious questions about the Benghazi attack, questions which have yet to be answered. But it's clear why critics are dissing it--it shows Americans as veritable superheroes in a country gone berserk. Also, the movie makes no bones of the fact that the whole ""protest over an anti-Islamic video"" explanation was totally bogus, and our country, protected by true blue men and women willing to give their lives, is run by a bunch of jackasses. I hope Hillary goes down for this. But three years later, no one has even been fired. <br/><br/>This movie doesn't answer any of those questions. But it is so emotionally involving I found myself with my fist in my mouth most of the time. Michael Bay may have his faults, but he knows how to move an audience--to laughter and to tears. There were moments that went a bit overboard—this is a Michael Bay movie, after all—but I am thankful it was him and not some anti-American, Oliver Stone-like director who made this movie. There are good guys and bad guys in the world, and Americans are the good guys. Especially in Benghazi."
"debbie-willoughby","10","37","68","21 July 2016"," Wonderful truthful retelling of Benghazi
","I feel compelled to review this and say what a wonderful and truthful retelling of the Benghazi battle this movie is. BIG props to Michael Bay and his team, especially having the real men as close consultants on the film. Well done the actors for a very realistic portrayal of these heroes. This film answered all my questions about Benghazi and has HUGE integrity. Was very violent- as were the real events but very realistically done. It was so shocking watching the attack on Ambassador Stevens and hearing him radioing for help- so hard to watch, his poor family :( This film should be shown in to every politician and every school kid around the world.

"topeka_brooks","10","66","132","18 January 2016"," American Heroes Save 31 Lives (inc their own)
","13 Hours is not for the faint of heart. It is not for children or for those with a weak constitution. Blood and gore alone is not the issue. The violence is almost non-stop. Our heroes and the people they protect face certain horrific death if they fail. And in some cases they do.<br/><br/>The good guys slaughter their attackers at a pace that makes Total Recall pale in comparison. All of this is explicit, graphic, gory, and obscene. It's also totally appropriate. It is a war film after all.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the political implications of this film, but the film lacks any bias if one accepts the idea that American mercenaries have the right to defend the people they are supposed to protect.<br/><br/>Bay wisely choose not to insert any propaganda into the film. The only overt political message was the testimony of the American combatants. At the end of the film, one character sees a Libyan transport approaching, and he mutters something about 'no Americans.' If that doesn't say it all, I don't know what will.<br/><br/>Film critics have attacked the film, but frankly that's their bias showing. If these were anti-Americans doing the same thing to freaks, monsters, or genocidal maniacs, the critics would fawn over it.<br/><br/>Bay has outdone himself, and not only produced a great film, but he went beyond his own personal views to tell the story."
"kj570140","9","47","91","16 January 2016"," Another Fantastic Modern War Film
","Following in the footsteps of other January Released Modern War Flicks based on books (Lone Survivor and American Sniper), 13 Hours is thoroughly entertaining if I dare say the funniest of these films. 13 Hours for the most part takes away the political cluster of the Benghazi incident and mainly focuses on the job at hand for the 6 ""bodyguards"" protecting a secret CIA outpost. Which makes this film the perfect vehicle for Michael Bay to direct as it focuses on the action of the incident primarily.<br/><br/>The film that I would make the greatest comparison to 13 Hours would naturally be Black Hawk Down (even referenced in this film), which to be honest is not a negative because Black Hawk Down is an amazing film. There are just a lot of similarities as these heroes have to protect themselves in a foreign land where it honestly seems like everyone is an enemy.<br/><br/>This film naturally is full of Michael Bay-isms and full disclosure I love most of Michael Bay films all full of machismo. 13 Hours has the super slow-mo, the pan over a field with children playing (Armageddon), the camera moving through objects (Bad Boys II), and the bomb dropping (Pearl Harbor). So take that a positive or negative in regards to how you feel about a Michael Bay film. <br/><br/>All the actors who play the 6 soldiers are amazing! Their interactions with each other is so natural and believable which helps feel for the characters when the chaos starts. The comedic relief soldier, Tanto, played by Pablo Schreiber was wonderful and helped break the tension in this very suspenseful and intense situation. ""Fighting a war in shorts"" cracked me up every time.<br/><br/>The MVP of this movie was James Badge Dale as Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods. He portrayed the leader of the group perfectly as a flawed man who just wants to do the right thing. He should be a bonafide A-Lister. <br/><br/>All in All this was a very good, entertaining movie that should be seen in theaters and I will probably by the Blu-Ray Steelbook when it comes out."

Let's you understand why Benghazi is still in the news and why it should be!<br/><br/>Some of the paid movie critics--particularly those from liberal publications--are attempting to diss the movie. They are way off base. The movie doesn't get caught up in trying to send a message or politics. In fact, I don't believe that Obama's or Clinton's names are even mentioned in the move. The director has even said that he went out of his way to keep politics out of the movie. The movie just shows what happened in Benghazi--or rather, what didn't happen in Benghazi. What didn't happen, was that no air help was given to those under attack despite multiple calls for help. People died because nothing was done. Terrible!"

","Seriously, no one can say that Michael Bay didn't go out of his way to avoid the politics on this film. The facts, however, speak for themselves. The movie is action-packed and kept my attention the entire time. Very few films do that. From D.C. things get political and the temptation is always present to reduce the consequences of bad decisions through cover-up and misinformation. The story is one of the decisions the real heroes must make in the heat of battle torn between leadership and just doing the right thing. I recommend anyone interested in what actually happened to see this movie but it should be a requirement for those who intend to vote."

","I am retired from 31 years in the Army, and I watch a lot of movies. I enjoyed ""13 Hours"" more than any movie I've seen since ""American Hustle."" Just tremendous. Generally I avoid movies about the military because the makers usually get it so wrong. I never detected a single slip, a comment or reference that rang false. This has to be one of the most compelling stories in recent years, and it was told with no comment on politics or any effort to affix blame for what transpired. Generally I tire quickly of ""action"" movies, but this one kept me enthralled. By the end I was exhausted and exhilarated. Truly a superior story told with taste and craftsmanship."

"skscarama","9","29","58","18 January 2016"," Makes the soldiers voice heard
","Too often in life the truth of a story is buried by political maneuvering that goes unchallenged by the media and we (the public) receive a story that may be very different from reality. <br/><br/>One could talk a lot about the different aspects of this film: the action, the politics, military tactics, etc...but in the end what I thought was most compelling was that the individual soldiers voices were heard (I'm using the term ""soldier"" as a catchall here...there were former Marines and Navy personnel involved as well the former Army guys). It's a rare thing for the guy on the ground to have this much weight given to his voice in order to tell what he saw, so I applaud the directors for giving that to them.<br/><br/>The story is told through their eyes. It is the story of what they actually experienced on the ground. Gone is the smoke and mirrors of politics that tries to cast everything in a favorable light that makes future election cycles look good. This is the raw experience straight from the mouths of the men who fought it. <br/><br/>The film doesn't seek to explain the ""why"", it only relays the ""what"". It's up the viewer to go forth and sort it all out. Why wasn't help sent? Why was the security situation so weak to begin with? Why was it reported so differently in America as opposed to how it actually happened?<br/><br/>The film did an admirable job of building up the tension even though we all know what happened. The tension was felt as those calls for help came, and it crescendos as the only 5 or 6 men in the world who can help are forced to sit and do nothing. <br/><br/>Any American fighting man who watches this will cringe...because these calls actually happened...and real Americans actually died...and if you've served this country in any capacity you will be angry sitting there and not being able to do anything.<br/><br/>The film does a very good job of telling not only the primary story of the attacks through the eyes of those who fought it, but does a remarkable job of delivering the personalities of those men, and the struggles their families faced as well. That's not an easy job. <br/><br/>I'm not very familiar with John Krasinski, I only know him from watching a season or two of The Office. However, he proves in this film that he can act. He did a great job.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only distracting thing was that they cast two actors from the TV series The Office to be in the film. The whole time I was thinking ""isn't that other dude from The Office too?"" So both Pam's husband, and his long time romantic rival from The Office are co-starring in this movie. It's a little strange to see Jim and Roy from The Office on a rooftop together...but not so strange that it takes away from the film. At no time did I expect Michael Scott to walk on screen.<br/><br/>In the end I guess the film has something for everyone. The guys will love the action, the girls get to cry, and everyone comes out with a better idea of what actually happened in Benghazi.<br/><br/>Go see it."

","I saw ""13 Hours:The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" starring, John Krasinski-Aloha, Leatherheads; James Badge Dale-The Walk, World War Z; Max Martini-Fifty Shades of Grey, The Unit_tv and Matt Letscher-Her, The Mack of Zorro.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story about a small group of military men fighting an Alamo type fight-a few men holding off big forces-in Benghazi, Libya on September 11th of 2012. They like that date-9/11-in that part of the world. It's directed by Michael Bay, who knows his way around an action movie-The Transformer movies, Bad Boys movies, Armageddon and The Rock, just to name a few he had a hand in. Matt plays the American ambassador to Libya that is stranded at the embassy when it is attacked. John, James and Max are GRS soldiers used as security for the C.I.A. that are stationed about a mile away. If you have never heard of the GRS-I know I haven't before this movie, it stands for Global Response Staff-they are the secret soldiers in the sub title of the movie. They are made up of special-ops guys from different branches of the military, such as SEALS, Army and Marines. From about 5:00 pm until around 6:00 am the next day-13 hours-the GRS helped save lives and fight off enemy soldiers until help could arrive. Not all survive but a lot more of the enemy bite the dust in truly heroic fashion. Some of the fighting is pretty graphic; I remember one of the GRS walking around after a fierce battle with his arm almost detached, just hanging by a few tendons and muscles. Most of the men have families back home and all they can think about is just getting back to their homes safely and seeing their loved ones again. I don't know about anyone else but it made me feel patriotic and thankful of the men & women who give their all for our country. It's rated ""R"" for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 24 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

This movie even surprisingly has some comedy in it also. This is a very inspirational movie that is suspenseful funny and even very sad at some parts. This film is based on a very accurate true story and 2 out of 3 men who were the real soldiers said this film was highly accurate the last person said no only because of one minor detail that I will leave out of this review.

","A true movie some people in power do not want you to see, it shows how incompetent and disconnected the ruling class are at times. If ignorance is bliss, bliss is over rated I will take the truth no matter how disturbing. So as for how the movie looked it was awesome. The visual effects are stunning. Do not bring young children as it is extremely graphic in the violence, shootings and explosions. The acting of a couple of people was just OK but most will draw you in and connect with you. If you are a hard and fast supporter of certain political leaders do not go see this as you may have need to question your support. I left with mixed emotions of sadness, anger, disgust and proud to know that we have some real American hero's willing to give every thing for other Americans. People will say what they think really happened in Benghazi but the only ones who know are those who lived it. If anyone has a different account other than this one. Go make your own movie of ""what really happened was"", good luck with that."

","One thing needs to be kept in mind when watching any war film that portrays the US's military misfortunes in recent years; this is ""not"" America. <br/><br/>The cold hard facts are the US administration and its allies invaded Libya and overthrew its government. This triggered a factional war between rivals groups vying for power. No one officially asked the US government and its European pals to do what they did and their reasons for doing so, are, to say the least, questionable. <br/><br/>The film itself is well directed, the action scenes capably executed and the material is inherently interesting. That said, this film is also very one sided. It fails to acknowledge any culpability on the part of the US government, for the misery and chaos, their role, in what I would describe as adventurism, has caused the Libyan people. <br/><br/>So whilst I felt a degree of sympathy for the those on the ground, the realty is, this is yet another place in the world where the US simply should not be.

"ironhorse_iv","7","8","14","13 December 2018"," It's no secret, I'm not a fan of a lot of director Michael Bay's latest works. However, '13 Hours' was not that bad. It was decent enough to watch.
","Inspired by true events & based off author Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book of the same name, this biographical war film follows the story of six members of Global Response Staff (GRS), who fought to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, during Ansar al-Sharia militant's attacks on September 11, 2012. Without spoiling the movie directed & produced by Michael Bay, too much; the motion picture was hatred by most of the Libyan people due to their negative portrayal. To the film's credit, I have to disagree with them, the audience does see many Muslims grieving and mourning the deaths, cause by the attacks and held signs apologizing for the extremists' violent acts. Adding on that, we do see several locals assisting the Americans. If anything, people should be angrier at the flick for being very clunky with overbearing visual special effects, chaotic camerawork & gratuitous explosions, macho sex appeal, and out of place, product placement such as 'Call of Duty' video games and cars from Mercedes-Benz. However, the worst had to be the utter lack of substance & character development within the main subjects. I can hardly remember, any of the GRS members, besides semi fictional Jack Da Silva (John Krasinski), whom comedic actor really did go all out for this role, by bulking up. Krasinski was very surprising, convincing as a serious gritty soldier. It's very unique. Don't get me wrong, the other performers did alright in the acting department as well, it's just that the personalities & charisma of their characters seem to all blended into one, during the quieter moments of the movie. None of them, stood out. They lack diversities. It didn't help that the film focus too much on overfilled action scenes, involving fictional previous missions that GRS went through, while in Libya, rather than establishing more of their family units & the warnings signs, leading to the compound attack. Their actions throughout the film didn't seem heartfelt, despite Lorne Balfe's amazing nail bitingly dramatic score. '13 Hours' really did missed some good moments to show us, how truly deep their sacrifice were. It only had surface level depiction of heroism; which is sad. Still, I like how the Rated R war film does not shy away from the gory, bloody images of war and the harsh language. I also dig the mixer of real life news archive footage of the event, with the reenactments. It gave the film a lot of authentic, unlike his other war film, 2001's ""Pearl Harbor', which borderline romantic fantasy. Surprisingly, this combat movie is little more historical accurate after the first half. However, there were some jarring things that screenwriter, Chuck Hogan & Michael Bay put in the film that really did not belong. Some examples are the way, the film constantly berating the CIA & Diplomatic Security (DS) agents outside from these private military contractors, as stuck up villainy cowardly pricks with no concept of tactical awareness. This is far from real life, as testimony shows, that both government agencies acted heroic, given the situation. While, it is true, that both groups ignore warnings like when two former security guards for the consulate, threw an IED over the consulate fence in April 2012; & just four days later, a similar bomb was thrown at a four-vehicle convoy carrying the United Nations Special Envoy to Libya, exploding twelve feet from the UN envoy's vehicle. There is little evidence that those assembles, including the Obama administration top heads deliberate sabotage themselves furthermore, by not providing air cover and ground support, that night; in order to cover up, the intelligence that the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria. Things like the over the top, stick in the mud, disrespectful, ineffective twit Chief-of-Station Commander, 'Bob' (David Costabile) trying to tell the men to stand down is clearly false. In real life, they were only little tactical disagreements between them about the speed with which the GRS team should depart for the rescue, not full grown hatred for each other. As for no air support argument; that is also not true, as government agencies did sent a surveillance drone to do a number of flybys, throughout the night & early morning. The reason for this, was due to the fact that there were no nearby attack aircraft on high alert that night with weapons & fuel within a 10 hour flight to Libya, because of a major maintenance overhaul. While, it's true that the closest fighter planes to trouble spots in North Africa were based in Aviano, Italy. Unlike the film, those fighter planes there, were not ready. Misleading viewpoints like these, were the reasons why some of the things told by the perspective of the soldiers were debunked in the ten investigations by different agencies on the matter. That's the problem with '13 Hours'. It's specifically composed, only by the unchecked bravado perspective of the soldiers, rather than everybody involved in the rescue mission. It's a bit one sided. Bay should had research more about the event from multiply sources including the FBI; the one by an independent board commissioned by the State Department; two by Democrat-controlled Senate Committees; and six by Republican-controlled House Committee, rather than taking the one book source material at its word. In the end, moviegoers should know, while, Bay says the film purposefully steers clear of politics. It's really not. You can clearly, see, where they stand on the issue, based off, how they market the film. Not only was this film about a controversial foreign incident released during an extremely contentious election year, with movie studios specifically marketed it to conservatives; but it also screen by key Republican Party figureheads, hoping to generate endorsement quotations. In the end, this film might have help cost, Hillary Clinton, the election, even with it being a box office bomb. Despite that & some flaws. '13 Hours' is still watchable, during its 2 hour & 24 minute runtime. It's worth checking out."
"Solanderer","9","18","38","21 January 2016"," EXTREMELY well done, even if there are some annoying Bay-isms still present
","Michael Bay has pulled off what Peter Berg did two years back, direct complete trash--Berg's ""Battleship""/Bay's ""Transformers: Age of Extinction""--followed by gold. ""Lone Survivor"" redeemed Berg, and while it's a bit harder to say that ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" has redeemed Bay (Bay has made quite a few awful movies) it at least shows that he is capable of making a fantastic movie. <br/><br/>This is a movie that treats the actual story of what went down in Benghazi on September 11th 2012 with respect. I was riveted the whole way through as it is honest, entertaining and gut-wrenching. It doesn't concern itself with the politics too much, but it doesn't ignore it either, as by the end you just have to ask yourself why, despite having a drone video feed to observe the carnage, wasn't the U.S. Government quick to respond and save American lives? Hillary Clinton doesn't want you knowing why. (Yes liberals, I went there)<br/><br/>You wouldn't think the acting in a Michael Bay movie would be any good either, but I can't think of a single actor who didn't give a competent performance in this. Directing-wise, some Bay-isms are still present, but only a few are really distracting. (namely a awkwardly placed slow-motion mortar shell moment)<br/><br/>Please go see this movie in theaters, because if a Great Bay movie doesn't prove financially viable, he could lapse back into transformers crap."

","I endured about a third of this before giving up. I guess this was aimed at drawing in those viewers whose lives revolve around the realism of the world of video games. Maybe the balance of the movie involved some real substance, but the first bit was nothing but childish nonsense with some facts tossed in to make it easier to swallow.<br/><br/>You've got a bunch of testosterone-addled clowns who each sports a beard; who give cute monosyllabic nicknames to each other as well as to everyone and everything they encounter; who have adorable wives, children, dogs back home; who work out; who play video games to demonstrate how relaxed they are in the dangerous environment; who use the f-word every two minutes so we know how tough they are; and who think they know everything there is to know about Libya from weeks spent inside American compounds surrounded by Americans.<br/><br/>All the locals are portrayed as clownish, sinister, cowardly cartoon characters and the Americans involved above the rank of knuckle-draggers are either slaves to mindless protocol or buffoonish pie-in-the-sky Harvard or Yale dilettantes.<br/><br/>I'm not sure which is more troubling, that this serious event has been reduced to this soap operatic cast of caricature-characters or that this portrayal remotely matches the actual people involved. In either case I'm sure many of those who watch it will absorb it all to be stored away as fact  just like Batman and Superman battling the forces of evil is fact.<br/><br/>Sadly disappointing case of Hollywood reshaping reality to appeal to the crowd who needs car chases and plenty of weaponry to keep their attention from wandering."
"jimqmg","9","12","24","30 January 2016"," Much better than expected
","First off, I'm not used to Hollywood making a movie like this. Most of the media takes a strong side one way or the other. I thought this movie was fairly even handed. It had great action, some humor to break up the super intense scenes, and it does a good job of developing the main characters. <br/><br/>All that said...I'm military, I've been there and I felt they captured the flavor of the area, the action, the tension, and the humanity of both sides. The people of Bengasi aren't portrayed as evil terrorists; they're a total mixed bag of people like most of the Middle East. The majority of them are just trying to live their lives. The problem is...over there, you don't know who's on your side at any moment, sometimes people show up out of no where to help, sometimes people take off when you need them most. The only ones you can really count on are your own team. They nailed that.<br/><br/>I would have given this 10 Stars but they barely touched on the attempted cover up of what was really going...compared to what we found out a few months later. To be fair, the focus of the movie is really the guys with boot on the ground. To some up, I went to the movie with six of my buddies. Some military, some not. Some conservative, some more liberal, and some in the middle. We all really enjoyed the film."
"ryanmark-57919","9","14","29","17 January 2016"," Fantastic Film and One of Michael Bay's Best
","I have to admit that I was a little nervous about this movie when I saw the trailers for the first time. The film looked great but I was worried as soon as I saw the name Michael Bay. I won't go into it right now but his recent filmography has left me disappointed and a little uneasy whenever I see his name in the credits. Fortunately, this movie reminded me that Bay can still make good films as long as the words turtles or transformers aren't in the title. This is not only an excellent action movie but it really brings the drama as well. Let's get to the story.<br/><br/>This film is based off of the true story of the attack on the U.S. embassy and a CIA compound in Benghazi in the months following the fall of Gadhafi. The action mostly focuses around the six men that make up the security force for the CIA outpost and the crap they had to go through in order to not only try and save the US Ambassador but also defend their own base long enough for backup to arrive and get them out of there. Easier said than done.<br/><br/>The cast for this film aren't exactly big names or anything like that but they all do an excellent job regardless. This might sound a little strange but I prefer lesser known actors for these types of movies. It feels like the story can be a little less biased since it doesn't have to constantly follow the highest paid actor or actress. The closest thing to a main character this film has is John Krasinksi's character Jack Silva. Silva is a skilled ex-soldier that goes to Libya for the money but ends up regretting his decision because of how much he misses his family. Krasinski does the character justice by showing us the no nonsense attitude without going to far into corny badass soldier. That's one thing I have to give the film credit for. Everyone comes off genuine rather than unbeatable Rambos. I also really enjoyed the interactions between Rone played by James Badge Dale and David Costabile's character Bob. They both want the best for the people they're trying to protect but they go about it in completely different ways. Rone is more straightforward and quick to come to a decision while Bob is more contemplative but slow to adapt to changing circumstances.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the different perspectives of command that we see through Rone and Bob and it's obvious that the movie shows us that Rone is the better leader but this kind of takes us into the territory of how one sided this narrative is. I mean, we see the narrative from multiple perspectives but the CIA is depicted as surprisingly ignorant to the situation they find themselves in. Now I don't know much about the history of this actual event but it surprises me that the CIA wouldn't have been able to figure this out a little sooner. Who knows, maybe this story is actually incredibly accurate but it does seem a little lopsided in favor of the security team.<br/><br/>The action is really well done in this movie and doesn't come off as too romanticized. Everything is gritty and fast-paced and you have to focus to keep up with the action. I'm usually not a fan of shaky cam but I always seem to accept it a bit easier in these types of movies. These events actually did happen and it feels more genuine, like we're actually there with them while all this craziness is going on. Even so, I wouldn't have enjoyed the shaky cam if I couldn't understand what was going on but I had absolutely no trouble keeping up with the action.<br/><br/>I really don't have any complaints to make other than the one sided nature of the narrative but that's honestly minor and didn't keep me from enjoying the film. I'm going to go ahead and avoid the more political discussion surrounding the movie since I don't believe this is the kind of place to bring that up but I do believe the narrative brings up some interesting questions about how our government should support our people abroad and the roles they should play in these countries. Anyway, the movie's great and I wholeheartedly recommend it."
"birthdaysuit11","3","82","220","17 January 2016"," I Tried to Enjoy This Movie
","A banal formula for same old American war propaganda films.<br/><br/>I tried to look past the propaganda and see what this movie was really trying to convey, but in the end it left me in a lapsing coma unable to distinguish what was and was not being foretold truthfully. Politics aside, the movie portrayed the Libyan people as savages, when in reality many of them helped save these soldiers. It seems that this movie completely disregards this fact, that and the increasingly tiresome propagandizing of mutilation, gore, and extreme patriotism. Violence that is effectuated throughout the film, start to finish. Of course this merely hides the terrible screenplay and vapid clichés but what more can you ask from Michael Bay? This is a full blown North Korean Propaganda film, except its American."

","13 Hours is the unadultered truth about what happened at Benghazi. although a great film by Michael Bay it may it could have just as well been a documentary. And the lives that were lost due to the incompetence of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. This movie is not about politics but about the truth and how they tried so hard to go on to save ambassador Stevens and the other 3 at the embassy. Obama and Secretary Clinton did nothing while the bottle when on for 13 hours straight. Had Hillary Clinton the Secretary of State taken action our 4 Americans would be alive. When he movie was over, there wasn't a dry eye in the theatre. You could hear people crying. There was no cheering only silence as the reality of what truly happened and how it could have been prevented begin with sunk in. The audience was truly moved and I hope that when people watch this they don't see a Hollywood blockbuster but they see the truth and realize that Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and Obama let down are people at the Embassy. This is the same Hillary Clinton that had another filmmaker put in jail. Ambassador Stevens had requested security over 600 times from Hillary Clinton's state department and was turned down. And everyone keep saying that there wasn't a stand down order but I choose to believe the soldiers on the ground because they have no reason to lie our soldiers are honest, trustworthy and honorable. Our soldiers are willing to give their lives so that others may live. They do not have a political agenda. Also the families of the victims so people need to stop buying Hillary Clinton's BS. Hillary is such a liar and this movie not only made me extremely sad but it infuriated me that our country abandoned our people to be murdered at the hands of terrorist. They need the truth from the moment it happen and yet they came out with a fake narrative about it being caused by a video in order to win the next election. Whatever happened to the days when our nation came first before politics. My family has served in the military and every war since the Revolutionary war with many serving 20-40 years. To claim that the military vets are lying is unbelievable hypocrisy. This is a must see movie for everyone who is an American."

","The fact that 13,000+ users of a popular movie review site have given 13 Hours an 86% favorable rating while only 50% of the ""Top Critic"" reviews on the same site are positive highlights the fact that there is more to this film and viewer reaction to it than the objective merits of the screen writing, acting, directing, and cinematography that dramatize the events that occurred in Benghazi three years ago. <br/><br/>Depending on one's preconceived notions of what transpired in Libya (and in Washington) before, during, and after the attacks of September 11-12, 2012, the film is either a badly edited, misleading, jingoistic, paean to machismo, violence, and racism, with inadequate character development and misrepresentation of facts – or a moving and realistic docudrama, based on factual first person accounts by members of the unit who participated in the events - a heartfelt and well-crafted tribute to the courage and honor of a small group of skilled mercenaries whose heroic performance of duty in battle amid the fog of war was exemplary, despite ineffectual local CIA leadership and an off- site chain of command that was unresponsive to desperate requests for readily available special ops and tactical air support.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately a litmus test of one's political orientation. That orientation is unlikely to be changed by the film. Those who think that the Benghazi incident is settled or ""at this point, what difference does it make?"" will find much to criticize – and are probably unlikely to attend. Those who think that there are substantial and inexplicable differences between official accounts and what really happened on the night of 9/11/2012 in Libya and Washington may expect to find much to admire, just as did the 20,000+ spectators who attended the premier of the film in Dallas last week rather than stay home to watch the State of the Union address."

","I really wanted to say that John Krasinski was exceptional as the lead in this film, and his office co-star was a nice addition. That said this film was surprisingly good. Bay has the ability to combine action with moments of real heroism. The film really puts you in the thick of what was a situation that went awry very fast.<br/><br/>Sure there were some layered on cheese; The slow flags waving with tattered cloth, the montage of the men before battle communicating with loved ones, and the following of a (mortar shell in this case) that ends on impact. However take away the cool to say ""BAY is an explosives and CGI director"" and you are left with a riveting look at a story that still resonates to American audiences.<br/><br/>On a final note; not to get too political; I was impressed that a big budget Hollywood production did not try and persuade the audience in favor of a recent Presidential candidate. Although it did not come out and state one way od the other on why the Embassy was sieged, it made it clear that the people involved had differing opinions than the stories the American public were told."

","Watched the movie, read the book. <br/><br/>The screenplay is 98% accurate to the content of the book. Small things such as things that happened in real life to specific people that happen with other people in the screenplay. Such as ""silva"" spends pretty much the entire battle at the Annex on building B. The movie doesn't portray it that way. Some other minor points that were glossed or slightly altered while retaining the spirit of the incident. Along the lines of Blackhawk Down or We Were Soldiers, the incidents happened, just not necessarily with the personnel shown on screen.<br/><br/>But as a combat Veteran I believe the actors and director hit the feel of the situation and the quick changes from hum dumb to 110% on the head. We routinely had indigenous forces embedded with us and the portrayal in the film is exacting to my experience with those forces. Are you with us? Against us? With us right now? <br/><br/>In summary, well told, well directed, good pacing, and will only be trashed because Michael Bay directed it. But take that with a grain of salt because John Huston directed The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Annie."
"Stewball","8","13","28","17 January 2016"," Remember the Alamo
","It's impossible to separate the politics from this ""true story"" of valor, but I can't imagine why anyone would even try. It's blatantly obvious that security at the compound was woefully inadequate, which was brought up by Ambassador Stevens and others down the chain; but the lack of response using F-16s and a C-130 gunship which were standing by cries out for Administration transparency. Instead, we were told it was an impromptu demonstration generated by a video on YouTube. Even if that lie had been true, so what? Does that mean those assets should not have been used and the security team told to ""stand down"" The movie doesn't offer any explanations for why no response was authorized, though it does beg the question for the reason for such a lack of response. The closest it comes is to show an image of the White House just after the attack begins, with the subscript, ""The POTUS is briefed"". Technically, the movie is pretty phenomenal in it's recreation of the events, though it is hard to follow at times--though that could be written off as an accurate portrayal of the fog of war. But enough already with even its occasional use of the shaky-cam. At times it looked like I was watching it through helmet-cams like someone playing ""Call of Duty"", which I guess could be considered a compliment to the film and/or the game.<br/><br/>One of the six, Mark Geist, equated this battle to holding the Alamo, though this turned out better for all but four of the defenders. That's a good analogy, with Al Qaeda standing in for General Santa Anna; but the likes of those ""Texians"" such as Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, didn't have cameras from above beaming their actions back to Washington--or reinforcements being held idle only minutes away."

","Michael Bay did a top notch job of showing the horror and intensity of the Benghazi attacks, while being objective and accurate on the unfolding of the actual events.<br/><br/>It's too bad he didn't include an A-list star because more people would have been drawn to see the movie, a la American Sniper -- and it's definitely a movie worth seeing. He purposely wanted no stars, thinking it would be a distraction. I disagree, because I'm sure many viewers (like me) assumed it was a lower budget, B-type movie, because of the lack of star power, and stayed away. It certainly wasn't.<br/><br/>Some of the revelations regarding the U.S. Government's lack of assistance to the brave heroes who fought in the battle -- and lack of the provision of security pre-battle -- were shocking and puzzling. Bay had the courage to factually lay out these issues, but wisely left politics out of it, to let the viewer decide.<br/><br/>Bay also provides an interesting window into the mindset of highly-trained U.S. military men, who should be applauded and thanked. It's hard for civilians to understand their psyche, but this movie helps.<br/><br/>13 Hours is one of the most realistic movies ever made about the savagery of modern-day military battle. It is also very pertinent to the 2016 presidential election. It should be seen by all who plan on voting. Draw your own conclusions -- but hold onto your seat."

"DannyDnB","2","17","41","17 September 2016"," Decent in parts, not so much in others.
","13 Hours is the newest movie by Michael Bay, about the 6 U.S security fighters who were stranded in an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and had to defend themselves against waves of terrorist attacks. <br/><br/>I'm going to say that if this is a story you are interested in, it would not hurt to watch it, however, if this is not a story that interests you, stay away!<br/><br/>The film is your typical Michael Bay movie, filled with enough explosions to leave your ears ringing, and camera cuts that made me nauseus. Some of the shots of the action scenes are quite good, with some moments where things felt smooth. The rest of the film was a bit of a mess, and ultimately it leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was very average, but I can't decide if that's the actors faults, or the fact that the characters they play are extremely generic. I mean, I can think of many other war movies where the characters are exactly the same, with different names. I know that Bay is not a director famous for good character development, but I think that these characters should have been fleshed out more for the film to really have the effect it was aiming for.<br/><br/>I also think that the constant camera cuts made it very hard to really understand what was going on, especially during the action scenes. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that this is some of the worst cutting I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, some shots did work, and some of the action was enjoyable, especially closer to the end of the film. I also found the soundtrack to suit the feel of the movie quite nicely. Of course, it is a Micahel Bay movie, so I don't need to say that the special effects of explosions and gunfire were good for you to know that they will be at least impressive. <br/><br/>Overall, it was not the best time I've had watching a movie, and it could have been done way better than it was. Still, I do believe that people who are into this type of story would get a bit more out of it than I did."
"jamesferlong","2","50","145","25 May 2016"," About as real as Transformers
","This movie is about 80% drama, 20% fact and 100% boring as hell. <br/><br/>It's marginally more exciting that watching the actual Benghazi hearings, though the hearings actually have more re-watchability than this crap.<br/><br/>It's bad sound and fake special effects in a blow stuff up plot.. more or less the political version of Transformers. Nothing more, nothing less. <br/><br/>Bay needs to lay off the overproduction, imo. His movies just look too fake and too much like animations basically due to the overuse of CGI and filters to produce fake colors and darkness that's not really there. Those contrasts look better on screen, but they are fake and they steal actual realistic data from the scene and replace it with basically Photoshop data. <br/><br/>It's OK now and then, but to do every movie like that is lame. <br/><br/>The fact that Bay is such a coward he lied about the movie being political is really lame. Bay is a conservative, movies don't just get done on certain date by themselves. The story is 4 years old and the movie just comes out right before an election featuring Hillary Clinton.<br/><br/>YEAH.. OK Bay. You're not even remotely that clever nor are you movies. <br/><br/>The problem here is that unlike 911. There is no actual mystery about Bencgahzi and people just don't care. People don't even care about Snowden and that's 1000 times more interesting than Hillary having a marginal actual role in anything to do with Libya. Secresary of State is not a real military position. She was a suped up foreign adviser. There is no real situation where military deaths are the Sectary of State's fault. <br/><br/>Her primary job was basically selling the US to other nations, nothing to do with military or security. There is no real scenario where the Secretary of State is responsible for terrorists attacks or responses. It's not their job.<br/><br/>The military and intelligence agencies protest embassies and military bases. They don't sit around waiting for the President's foreign affairs adviser to tell them what to do. <br/><br/>This is 90% a made of narrative. Secretary of State simply doesn't wield that responsibility. Hillary is no more at fault for Benghazi than Giuliani is at fault for 911. The both technically had the capacity to stop those attacks, but it wasn't their job responsibility to magically know where an attack would be or what scale it would be.<br/><br/>That's the job of actual military advisors, not foreign advisors.<br/><br/>The film is not accurate. There was no stand down order, which they play up pretty big in the movie and nothing like that ever happened by any account. <br/><br/>It's more or less completely made up with a bunch of sad flashy effects to try to make a crap movie into something it's not.. in hopes idiots who hate Hillary will upvote it.. which they have.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean anyone cares... they don't. THey didn't care about Benghazi when it happened and at no point has the public started caring. Even 50 investigations later nobody cares about Benghazi or Hillary's email. Sooooo.... yeah good luck trying to get people interested in this silly BS of a movie. <br/><br/>You'd be better off making a movie about lead pipes, bathroom laws or border walls."

If you are simply looking for far right wing rhetoric wrapped Ina bad film, this will thrill you. No one who relies on truth will find this remotely close to it. Save your money.

"neonate870-11-41888","10","5","9","2 December 2018"," 13 Hours. The film that gets it right.
","I'll admit was a bit worried about seeing this film. Michael Bay has made some stinkers in recent years with the Transformers films, but this is a great return to good form and a big surprise. I was blown away by this film, just as I had been like when I saw Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>Being ex military, I understand the walk of life these brave men did everyday in their lives. Having read the book, been a former soldier, a U.S. Military History enthusiast, studied the history of terrorism, and also been personally attached to those in the DOD, I knew more information about this incident than most average Americans.<br/><br/>Bay conveys the incident without political bias, but the film indirectly points the finger at the fault of silence, poor choice/policy making, cover ups, and serious mistakes made by the Obama administration, left wing media, and other figures in DC. It doesn't drag us through the muddy mess of politics, as have other similar films. (Libya did become failed state and an ISIS stronghold, as did many places under Obama's administration)<br/><br/>The film portrays the incident as it happened, and how it was told in the book, and by the men who fought it. The films authenticity was inspected, approved and advised on very well by some of the personnel who fought that long night. Each character is easily remembered and can be told apart. They are likable, and portrayed as people who do amazing things, but also have everyday lives like people who do not serve. All the men and their lives in the are portrayed with incredible emotional weight and care you become attached to them.<br/><br/>The big surprise was seeing the likes of John Krasinski. I never expected to see him in a film like this. Truly a break away role for him. All the performances were non typical of a Michael Bay film. Not goofy, and just downright perfect. The action, the tension, the suspense are all excellent. Once the train gets going, Bay creates a wild and adrenaline rushed experience that is unforgettable. The action is not crazy stylized for thrills, but streamlined to convey the tension, horrors, and nightmare of the night in Benghazi on Sept 11th, 2012. It is pure combat footage of modern urban warfare.<br/><br/>The music is non typical of Bays movies. The score by Lorne Balfe is perfect for this film. It has its thrill moments, but ranks up there with the best emotionally jarring war film scores created by the likes of John Williams, James Horner, and other elite music writers. It draws you in along with the action, and the emotional performances.<br/><br/>This is a film that ranks up with war film experiences like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, The Hurt Locker, Act of Valor, Patriots Day, Lone Survivor, American Sniper, and Zero Dark Thirty. Very pro American, and pro American soldier. Not right wing or nationalist.I was glad to hear that it won an Academy award of sound, but it deserved more recognition than that.<br/><br/>This is where I come to the only disappointing thing for this film. The left wing media, the democrat party, the progressive controlled academy awards, and left wing film reviewers had already made there choice of slapping bad reviews and hating the film before it was ever released. The pro Hillary fever was deeply rooted in nearly all of Hollywood, and was a subject they love leaving out of the light. (The films release timing just also happened to be 2016, the year she lost.) The films gross was not very high but did reasonably well in such a hostile left leaning cinematic market.<br/><br/>I have now seen this film do very well on blue ray and also it has a good following. People in America now know they were lied to about what happened that night. And hopefully the mistakes will have been learned from. I talk to other people about this film and the regret not having seen it when it was released. It grabs at my heart, and theirs was well. Hopefully it will be informative to the ignorant, and entitled attitude Millennial generation that freedom is not without cost. And Americans die, it matters."

As a veteran, makes me proud to see that the brotherhood of these former soldiers is real. It's worth every penny and I hope people go see it, they won't regret it.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's best work here, no doubt. The movie is well made and I was surprised at how well Bay did at making you care about the characters. In most of his movies there is a tendency for the music and explosions to overrun the plot. Not so in this case go see it."
"alexczx","9","12","28","17 January 2016"," An tense, engrossing true story skilfully told. A must-see!
","I pretty much knew what to expect going in, and I was not disappointed. It's a tense, emotional, solidly done action movie that deserves to be seen and recognized as such. Sure, it could be a little shorter, and it's cheesy at times, and the shaky camera is annoying, but overall, it's the best and the most significant film Michael Bay has ever done. And kudos for going out of his way to remain politically neutral, although the story itself leaves the viewer with a lot of questions about our involvement in the Middle East -- regardless of the administration.<br/><br/>However, other people already commented in detail on this aspect of the story, so I'll defer to the earlier reviews for that.<br/><br/>What I do want to comment on is how films like this bring out outright partisanship among the critics. If the topic wasn't such a hot political potato and if it wasn't a Michael Bay movie (critics do love to hate him), it would be hovering somewhere between mid-70s and 80% on the RT. As it stands, it's teetering between 59% (green) and 60% (red), changing color every few hours. Some negative reviews don't even bother to cover their venom with a fig leaf of artistic assessment. So my advice would be to ignore the critics altogether. If you're still not certain whether you want to see the movie or not (and I believe that every conscientious adult should see it in order to draw their own conclusion), read what other viewers are saying. The viewer approval rating on RT currently stands at 86%, and that's much closer to the real worth of the film than the critics' rating."
"dave-mcclain","9","12","28","16 January 2016"," ""13 Hours"" is an excellent fact-based, politically-neutral telling of a remarkable story.
","Making a movie with political undercurrents can be a risky proposition for a filmmaker. Even if the subject matter is not overtly political in and of itself, if it can be seen as political, Movie Fans who are politically aware may, whether consciously or unconsciously, project their political predispositions onto the film, even if they actually know very little about its tone or content. I consciously try my best not to prejudge a movie based on my personal feelings about its background, but, if I think it looks interesting, to see it and let it rise or fall on its own merits. That's an approach that I think would serve all Movie Fans well when deciding whether or not to see ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" (R, 2:24).<br/><br/>The film is based on the 2014 book ""13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi"" by Boston University journalism professor Mitchell Zuckoff. I haven't read the book, but I'm here to tell you that the movie it has spawned is almost completely non-political. Telling the story of the well-coordinated terrorist attack on two U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, the movie never takes sides in the controversies that still swirl around the attack, its causes and its aftermath and never even mentions the names Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. There are a few passing references to some of the over-politicized aspects of this story, but those references remain fact-based, relevant to the plot and very brief. So, after talking about what this film isn't, let's talk about what it IS.<br/><br/>As the film opens, Jack Silva (John Krasinski) is being picked up at the Benghazi airport by colleague Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods, but the two men don't speak to each other or even make eye contact until they enter Rone's vehicle parked just outside the airport entrance. The low-key reunion is for reasons of safety and security. Jack is a short-term contractor who's in Libya to work with other former military special operators, part of a six-man detail providing security for a secretive (but not quite secret) CIA compound gathering intelligence and making contacts in post-civil war, post-Gadhafi Libya.<br/><br/>The difficulties inherent in the contractors' mission are apparent in the first few scenes. On the way back from the airport, Rone and Jack are trapped in the middle of a traffic jam caused by what looks like a political assassination in broad daylight. They call for help from the CIA compound, but receive none. The two men only get through an impromptu local security checkpoint by using their wits and threatening violence. After arriving at the compound, Rone tries to give the local CIA station chief (David Costabile) a hard time about denying his request for assistance, but the boss is having none of it. His main concern is lying low and not violating the political parameters of his mission – no matter what.<br/><br/>Jack meets the other members of the civilian security detail (played by David Denman, Dominic Fumusa, Max Martini and Pablo Schreiber) and begins going out on missions with the team. The men escort CIA employees as they meet up with their local contacts. Later, the team travels the 1.2 miles to coordinate with a two-man team providing security for a small U.S. State Department compound which is preparing to host Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, who wants to get more personally involved in reaching out more directly to the Libyan people, hopefully improving U.S.-Libyan relations. Rone's team is as concerned about the lack of physical and personnel security at the State Department compound as they are about similar problems at their CIA annex, but it's all part of the U.S. laying low in Libya.<br/><br/>Then, on the evening of September 11, 2012, the proverbial sh** hits the fan. Libyan militants attack the State Department compound in Benghazi. Those two security personnel stationed there heroically fight to protect the ambassador and the handful of other U.S. government employees and contractors, but they desperately need help. They call over to the CIA annex, but political considerations get in the way of a timely response. Eventually, Rone's team gets to the annex and they do what they can, but soon have to pull out and fall back to the compound. The team is expecting a follow-up attack on their annex, so they do what they can to get ready. The rest of that night involves a hard-fought and selfless struggle for survival by the 30+ Americans in that annex, trying to hold on until help arrives – IF it arrives.<br/><br/>Some movies centered on the military amount to little more than jingoistic nonsense and some movies directed by Michael Bay seem to exist merely as a platform for impressive visuals and lots of noise, but neither of these descriptions fits ""13 Hours"". The former military special operators-turned security contractors aren't portrayed as supermen, saviors or saints, but simply as men trying to do a dangerous job the best they can, then get home to their families. American policies and activities in Libya are portrayed as well-meaning, but as difficult to classify as ""good or bad"" as many of the Libyan people who the Americans encounter in this story. Michael Bay makes a tremendous effort to show the world as it is, tell a remarkable story as it happened and use his skills and experience to make an excellent movie. This politically neutral, exciting and inspiring fact-based account may make some Movie Fans uncomfortable, for a variety of reasons, but it's a story that deserves to be told and I'm thankful, for a variety of reasons, that it was told so well.

I was also glad to finally find out details about the actual military contractors who were there on the ground that day and who confronted the enemy Al Qaeda soldiers during the thirteen hours. It was the real deal and a night of horrors for the Benghazi embassy and CIA staff who were there. Since the actual Benghazi embassy attack I'd gotten so tired of all the political propaganda from the various sources after the attack. After all, every year since 9/11 Americans have somewhat expected that some jihadist somewhere in the world might try something else on another 9/11. This movie explains how things happened very clearly without getting political- which I appreciated. Now it's clear what happened that night.

I was especially impressed with John Krasinski of ""The Office"" fame.

I have nothing but respect for them.<br/><br/>First off, haters are going to hate, because the is a movie about an American Ambassador, being sent to a very dangerous area, and abandoned to die and it really rankles them, because there was no excuse and everyone in charge is lying and hiding.. So of course, those haters will deride the authors of the book as liars, even though they weren't on the ground, in the s#$t as they say and rattle on about all the investigations that supposedly led nowhere. I ask you, if you were in the loop and an Ambassador died, you would freely set yourself up for some serious jail time, voluntarily? Or a least lose your comfy safe desk job, sucking off the teat of the American taxpayer? <br/><br/>It's tense, right from the start, partially because we know the story. Bad stuff happening in a very bad place. Bay sets the tone almost immediately, showing how real men protect and save lives of people that don't respect them and maybe even hate them. It's their job and they do it to the best of their abilities.<br/><br/>You see also, though not much, that they are human, wives, kids, a desire to really be anywhere but where they are. And in a movie like this I wouldn't expect too much ancillary ""character development""; that comes later, but not much.<br/><br/>That development comes in the portrayal of courage and willingness to stare at what seems to be overwhelming odds, protecting people who view you as being no more that ""drivers"", or gophers for those ""Harvard and Yale grads"". <br/><br/>Bay delivers on what he can do well, lots of action and explosions. Except, these are robot in disguise, or asteroids, or some other unbelievable scenario. This was a real fight, real guns, bullets, with real people dying. <br/><br/>Dialog? what would you expect, being under fire for 13 hours, long soliloquies about the meaning of life? Did you want a sex scene between a beard and the female lead? <br/><br/>What angered me most, was what was lacking, and this is what is true and none of the haters can deny it. No other American help, outside of the other contractors and Deltas from Tripoli. There wasn't even an American transport, to fly the remains of the fallen Americans when the dust settled. <br/><br/>And I can say this on absolute authority. Our government is flat out lying that no assets were ready, available or had the time to provide assistance. I speak specifically in reference to the F-16's whether they were in Aviano or Sig, or on an ""exercise"" in Turkey. I worked with F-15's in what was mostly a very low threat environment on Okinawa. Every night, before the squadrons would bed down after training all day, each one was MANDATED to have 2 each aircraft, fueled, locked and loaded for any real world scenario. AND one KC- 135 fueled, ready to fly for midair refueling purposes. On an exercise in Alaska, same thing. so again, our government is lying or they have decimated the services so badly, that they cannot provide any war assets fro any real time threats. Either way.... <br/><br/>Go see 13 hours. Go see real patriots."

","Director Michael Bay (""Transformers"") rips reality from today's headlines presenting an in your face, behind-the-scenes look at the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya that took the lives of US Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letsher ""Scandal"") and Sean Smith, along with the lives of other US soldiers and many Libyan rebels. ""Wow"" is the word the comes to mind while both experiencing and then reflecting on the film. John Krasinski (""The Office"") joins his fellow soldiers (James Badge Dale, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman ""Parenthood,"" Dominic Fumusa ""Nurse Jackie,"" and Max Martine) and others as they are charged with protecting their compounds and rescuing Stevens. Each actor, along with the always great-to-hate character actor David Costabile (""Suits""), are excellent in their respective gritty roles, with Krasinski successfully stepping outside of his ""The Office"" role. Bay knows rock'm sock'm film making, and it all comes in handy here. Unfortunately, he is one of those directors who feels an up close, constantly moving camera is the best way to get his point across. Because of this style of filmmaking, much of the action is in blur. However, when he backs the camera away, allowing the audience to take in the surroundings, the result builds tension beyond belief. The ""Hillary"" effect isn't addressed here, so no need to beat a dead horse. Realistic writing by Chuck Hogan, and screenplay by Mitchell Zuckoff, keep the audience glued to the screen, action and storyline. From the film, and what we know from the news, something went seriously wrong in the communication in Libya, forcing our soldiers to step up and do what they do best - survive! Don't miss this one!"

","As I sat in my reclined seat at the movie theater, eating popcorn, and taking sips of my water I remained fairly relaxed and ready for the movie. The commercials fly by and the movie starts. The movie continues to about half way through and now I'm sitting on the edge of my seat with small tears rolling down my cheeks. The movie ends, I'm speechless shocked at what I just saw, and I was still trying to process what I just saw. <br/><br/>The movie ""13 Hours: Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is an accurate (according to the survivors) account of what happened on September 11, 2012. The movie is fast paced, brutal, and probably the closest a civilian could ever get to warfare without being in it. Lots of language (beware those who offended by strong language), lots of blood, explosions, screaming, and intense fights. The movie from start to finish is a thrilling experience that keeps your eyes fixed on the screen at all costs. Some parts are hard to watch as one operator is injured badly and two of the other operators are killed by mortar fire. The movie does a really good job at telling a war story that most people didn't know about when it was being reported after it happened. Because of this movie this account will be remembered by the American people for years to come. The soldiers that died will not be forgotten. <br/><br/>Some people think that the movie directly involves Hillary Clinton, but in no way is she directly in the movie. Of course those who have done their research should have concluded that Hillary is responsible for the life's lost that tragic night. At the end of the movie the operators do make a political reference that if you wanted to could be pointed at Hillary, but even then, it isn't directed towards. The movie strictly stays true to telling a war story and it really isn't political at all. . . At least on screen."
"steam8","4","23","65","16 January 2016"," Exhausting Fog of War Action Film
","Yet another Michael Bay flick that is full of action and special effects, but light on character development. In a way it works because it shows the constant trauma and confusion of battle, relentless in a way that no one has time to think or plan ahead...the quintessential fog of war film. They made this film as apolitical as possible in order to attract a wider audience, not just conservatives who want to blame Obama and Clinton. Clearly there was never a ""stand down"" order from the White House...that came from the station commander at the CIA safe house, and he wanted those 6 men (ex-military contract employees) to stay & protect the safe house & NOT go to the diplomatic outpost (it never was an official embassy). Ambassador Stevens volunteered for this assignment and did NOT want a huge protective force around, so that they could be more accessible to Libyans. Even his family has verified this and doesn't blame the US government. He died of cardiac arrest brought on by intense smoke inhalation, NOT by any beatings or mutilation by terrorists. In fact, it was a group of friendly Libyans who found him & got him to a medical center where he later died...the movie is very clear on this point. This film reminds me of Black Hawk Down & Lone Survivor...disastrous military operations with bad outcomes...you see it once, but don't want to see it again."

","The subject matter contained in this movie makes me sad and mad. Firstly I can't believe that these Americans waited so long to see the writing on the wall. I'm sure there is a lot more to the story that is ""classified"", but from what I saw they should have gotten the heck outta there sooner. It's a real shame that the executive branch of our government didn't see fit to help them out. A huge snafu to say the least. I'm mortified to see what happened there. The movie itself was well made and well acted. The things that go on behind the scenes with the CIA, our military, and our government have me shaking my head. God Bless the men and women who died there and the ones who survived the nightmare."
"Troy_Campbell","7","7","15","27 February 2016"," Solid war flick with less Bay-isms than expected.
","Don't be dissuaded by the fact that this is a Michael Bay film; the usually bombastic blockbuster director shows a relative level of restraint and integrity in his execution of this intense modern war tale. Sure, there are explosions, slow motion shots and chest-thumping moments of heroism, but unlike his increasingly egregious directorial flourishes in the Transformers series, here they are comparatively controlled and organic. Bay's propensity for overlong runtimes results in a repetitiveness that dampens the third act's power, however he executes the gun battles with enough ferocity and immediacy to maintain the immersion. Chuck Hogan's screenplay – adapted from Mitchell Zuckoff's novel – doesn't bring anything new to the genre, yet he adeptly avoids clichés through grounded characters and authentic interactions. A little less finger pointing would've been great though. Akin to Peter Berg's Lone Survivor, this Libyan-set true story relies heavily on the core group's chemistry and relatability to elevate the simple premise into a more affecting and interesting combat picture. James Badge Dale and John Krasinski lead the pack as long-time mates who miss their families but love their job, both bringing emotional heft and sincerity to roles which also required bulked-up physical transformations. The other notable cast member is Pablo Schreiber (of Orange is the New Black fame), who imbues his team joker with a surprising amount of depth and gravitas whilst also delivering most of the movie's levity. It's not in the same league as the great motion pictures depicting war, nevertheless 13 Hours is a kinetic, adrenaline-pumping and compelling yarn that offers a solid cinematic viewing experience."
"gianlucamarzano16","9","7","15","29 January 2016"," One of Michael Bay's best movies yet
","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is directed by Michael Bay and stars John Krasinski, Pablo Schreiber, James Badge Dale, and much more talented actors and actresses. First off, this is a true story and I didn't know much about this event. Now going into this movie my only concern was the director, Michael Bay. But I have say Michael Bay made a great movie with characters who have depth and action scenes that are shot well. Yes it has a few Michael Bay things like slow-mo, big explosions but he did a good job of not over using them, only using when needed. The acting was fantastic by everyone. There was not one bad person. Some characters had comedy parts and at times it worked while other times it didn't. The only major problems I had with the movie was the runtime, it felt a little too long and this was some gore in the movie that wasn't needed at. Overall 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi was a great movie with a great action and good story telling. One of Michael Bay's best movies yet."
"soggydeadgirl","8","7","15","27 January 2016"," Surprisingly good
","To be honest, I did not have any inclination to see this movie. Why? The politicization of the event, the endless hearings, the attempting to place blame in places other than where it belongs, etc. Sick of it and didn't want to waste money to see what we've been hearing for the last four years. I was wrong. This film does not politicize the events of Bengahzi. Instead it tells the story of some of the people who were there. Mainly we follow a group of highly trained, highly experienced contract security professionals attached to a clandestine CIA compound not far from the US State Department compound. When the State compound is attacked the team at CIA wants to go help because they know the security force there needs help. But bureaucratic nonsense keeps them from aiding.<br/><br/>It is a good movie."
"edjofsanity","9","7","15","26 January 2016"," Fantastic movie about a troubling incident.
","I was worried when I saw Michael Bay's name attached to this movie. One thing this story did not need was his tendency to glamorize and pontificate. After seeing this movie I can honestly say that I'm glad he was in charge. The directing helped the viewer to identify with what the soldiers were dealing with: not knowing what locals to trust; trying to obey superiors but wanting to save American lives. John Krasinski does a great job as soldier who is realizing the importance of his family. His underrated performance brings the heart to this movie. I was also worried that Bay would turn this story into some political message - he did not. This movie was about the soldiers' dilemma and how they saved American lives."
"pefrss","8","7","15","23 January 2016"," More question than answers, but fascinating to watch
","When I learned history in school I had trouble to relate. It seemed that they wanted me to learn mostly dates and places. And dates and places were not able to fascinate me. Luckily I was also an avid reader of fiction and reading historical novels made the events of the past so much more real . So to this day I have a tendency to look at historical events through the interpretation of artists, be it writers, painters, musicians or directors of movies. The older you get the more you realize that even events which happen during your life time and sometimes just around the corner from you are being interpreted in so many different ways, that at the end nobody really knows what happened. The attack in Benghazi certainly falls into this category. So politically charged and obfuscated, what was really going on? So I went to see the movie. First of all the movie was filmed in Malta not in Libya, I have been to Malta not to Libya and while there are similarities, they are not the same. The movie posed more questions than answers for me. Why was there so little security for the compound of the ambassador? Why did the official refused to send help? Why were these highly paid security contractors not used to help? Why did Tripoli refuse to send help? Why did the American base in Italy or Spain did not send help? All these places were not far away? I read somewhere that these American bases took 15 hours before they were able to dispatch somebody??? Why do the Libyan hate the Americans so much? Obviously big failure all around,from the state department to the pentagon and from some bureaucrats. So we are left with a handful of macho super warriors, who finally get permission, to fight hundreds of terrorists and that is the movie. We see this story in American war movies over and over again The super heroes who dodge all bullets while everybody else dies , they keep their sense of humor in even the most volatile situation and come out okay at the other end. Well, not everybody came out okay at the end and the film did a good job showing the humanity of those whose job is to kill and to be tough. So leaving the movie I was as knowledgeable as I was before. I do not know what happened I do not know what is being disguised from us and what orders have been issued to those who were there to shut up. I am glad to know that the surviving members of the warriors resigned and are pursuing a less dangerous life. Would I recommend that movie? Yes, I thought it was interesting but do not think that you know what happened afterward."
"Screen_Blitz","8","7","15","22 January 2016"," Intense, riveting film inspired by true events and tragedy
","With January being the month of some of the biggest box office (and critical) slackers of the year, many would not expect to see high- budgeted movies; especially ones brought by Michael Bay who's films are often subject for summer releases. However, instead of a two and a half-hour stretch of giant robots fighting head to head, Michael Bay takes a more mature direction in epic war adaption to Mitchell Zuckoff's novel based on the harrowing events on September 11, 2012, the night when the U.S compound in Benghazi, Libya was unexpectedly attacked by Islamic forces, which resulted in the death of the American Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens (played by Matt Letscher) and two CIA contractors; an event that made national headlines. Actors James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, Max Martini, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman, and Dominic Fumusa hit the screen as the six members of the security team who set out to defend the compound against the Islamic militants. What the results is an intense, powerful, and thought-provoking war flick that raises many questions.<br/><br/>This marks Michael Bay's third attempt at adapting a true-life event to the screen, with the being 'Pearl Harbor' and the second being 'Pain & Gain'; none of which come anywhere close to this solid attempt. This film paints a loud, but engrossing portrayal of the tragedy that occurred that night and the atrocity these soldiers went through, while steering away from the political territory; so there is no mentions of any political figures. Featuring extended scenes of loud, brutal combat with relentless gunfire, and of course abundance of explosions, the movie delivers a pack-punching depiction of soldiers' effort in active combat, to the point where you feel like you are the midst of the all the chaos; and these scenes are done not in a mindless, over-the-top way that Bay is often known for, but in a serious and authentic manner to make viewers feel the anguish of the characters. These scenes are shot on a nicely built set in Malta, which serves as a solid backdrop of Benghazi, Libya. The characters however, come as the film's weakness, with the character development falling short within the first hour. There is not much we learn about the characters other than them being as husbands and fathers, as shown with them having video chats with their families back at home. While the actors' performances stand strong, they're not quite enough to fully sustain their characters. <br/><br/>13 Hours is an intense, powerful movie that brings out the best of Michael Bay. It is a film that not only sparkles with a strong direction, realistic depiction of the horrors of war, but also pays a well tribute to the soldiers out there who are sacrificing their lives to defend the freedom of our country. It also shows that Michael Bay is capable of making decent films over some of the flops he's made in the last several years."

","It was difficult for me to watch this film. The true event was based on a day that will bleed my heart forever.

It is full of action yes, but this movie will hit your heart, especially if you imagine you were there, or you loved someone who was. Because that's what makes a true story more real. Mr Bay did it again, portraying not just guns and violence. He wrote history emotion, family, and reality to an extent. He then made it into a film that I for one will keep on my bookshelf. Thank you for making this film and showing the hell within the hell. A must see film!"
"LogicIsEverything","Null","32","99","11 April 2016"," Based on the true incident? Absolutely NOT!
","First of all, in order to know more about what the movie claimed: ""Base on True Incident"", I had borrowed the book from the library, trying to get a better picture of this movie. But guess what, the book itself simply read like a ridiculous fiction instead of a deeply researched documentary non-fiction! It read like a poorly written, totally made up crap. When you read it, you just felt like reading a novel, definitely not a believable, authentic, seriously recorded and researched truth-finding documentary non-fiction but 100% fictitious made-up. <br/><br/>So this film based on partially to that ridiculous book has turned out to be so ridiculous and so absurd to the extreme. Except borrowed from the book title and some vague background, the whole film actually got nothing to do with anything but just a 98% generically made-up rubbish. The embassy in this film looked just like a temporarily built compound to make the film. Those characters were also actually non-exist people. We didn't see any work or function done by the U.S. Embassy or the dummy Ambassador. What we saw was just some white Americans playing the hired guns, doing nothing but drinking and talking, or on the phone or laptop talking to their families in America. Those scenes just made me more curious about the great internet service in that pathetic country, and how come the Wi-Fi service and signals were so good all the time, their iPhones or iPad could so easily get connected to America and the signals were so strong and stable.<br/><br/>The characters made up by this lousy film are more ridiculous than any film claimed on true story or true incident basis. They were just a bunch of morons signed up to go to a remote 3rd world country to make more money than the average American soldiers. While staying there, they drove the expensive black Mercedes G Class jeep, roaming in those dangerous streets full of Islam fanatics, yet always returned to base with their scalps still existed on their heads. They were in the protection business, yet most of the time, they just lying around, drinking beers, talking over the laptops or iPhones with their families about kids birthday and similar crap all the time.<br/><br/>The whole film was so stupidly scripted like they were awaiting the big boot of the Islamic Jihadists to storm the U.S. Embassy, yet they didn't have any clue when it's gonna happen, they were just doing the guessing game and spent most of their time at leisure and small talks.<br/><br/>The Embassy compound just looked like a rush job for this movie shooting, with lot of middle-eastern looking temporary hired background actors to play those Islamic thugs. The whole movie just looked so pretentious and so fake. There is no way any Americans, especially the white ones could have survived in this movie made-up places and situations over one hour, albeit had an Embassy built. It's like when the Americans were still fighting with the North Vietnamese Communist army in the South Vietnam, an U.S. Embassy was already open for business in Hanoi. <br/><br/>What a joke this movie is! Some of the reviewers thought this a leftist propaganda or something similar, they should have their brains checked sooner than later. Because this film is just a Hollywood graffiti work, purely made for commercial entertainment purpose, it got nothing to do with anything historical but by some morons high on drugs made up a screenplay exactly like ""London Has Fallen"" or ""Olympus Has Fallen"", ""White House Down"", those movies about the White House was under attack or, ""Red Dawn"", America was invaded by North Korea... who cares?! These crappy movies are all the same, they were just bunch of video game-like crap, only the movie titles were different. And this one is no different but only stupider.<br/><br/>This is one of the worst movies disguised as a thriller."
"S_Craig_Zahler","7","6","13","20 January 2016"," '13 Hours' is the successful modern warfare movie that the highly confusing 'Black Hawk Down' and the very dull 'Zero Dark Thirty' were not.
","Although the phrase 'The best Michael Bay movie ever' may not be an actual compliment in a lot of circles, '13 Hours' is a solid 7 out of 10 and better than almost every movie that I saw in 2015. It is the successful modern warfare movie that the highly confusing 'Black Hawk Down' and the very dull 'Zero Dark Thirty' were not.<br/><br/>Showcasing a big cast of likable (and discernible) characters and some good (albeit slightly confusing) action set pieces, this movie bears comparisons to the HBO series 'Band of Brothers' and 'Generation Kill,' which it more strongly resembles, but it is actually a bit better than those good shows, thanks to the very likable, better differentiated ensemble cast of characters and the uncomfortable, but steady ratcheting of the plot. And unlike 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Zero Dark Thirty' almost all of the drama here actually works. The grisly moments are well--and dryly--handled, and the performances are good, and in some cases--such as with Schreiber, Denman, and Krasinski--very good.<br/><br/>None of the flaws are severe. Mostly, they are limited to the (expected) overcutting of the material, the occasional stylistic flourishes that don't quite gel with the rest of the movie (e.g. the mortar shell point of view), some scenes that are explained rather than shown (eg. the guarding the ambassador during his public appearance), and a handful of line readings of the wisecracking dialogue that don't seem as natural as those that are in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>In terms of morals and messages, '13 Hours' was noticeably grayer than I was expecting it to be, especially considering the director and that it was based on a true story. If I did not know who directed this, my first guess would actually have been Michael Mann--the visuals really have that lose, purposefully ugly 'Collatera'l and 'Miami Vice' (2006) feel--though this is certainly a much more sentimental picture than anything that Mann has made in decades. A surprisingly good ensemble war event along the lines of 'Men in War' (1957) and 'Battleground' (1949). Recommended."

","After watching it for many times, I could not resist myself to review this movie. This doesn't seem like a movie that Michael Bay would have directed. But the minute the explosions and gunfire commences, you will know that yes, this is indeed his film. He is after all, a pro at making things blow up in style. The fire fights are bloody and will get you right in the gut. No effort is spared in depicting the realities of a prolonged gun battle spread out over 13 sleepless, exhausting hours. The cinematography puts you right in the center of the melee. Make no mistake about it. This is an immersive and visceral film.<br/><br/>""Things change fast here in Benghazi.""<br/><br/>Hollywood biographical war pictures are used as devices to mark significant events of terrorism, a form through which we comprehend accounts of reality and glimpse on the American psyche. Over the last few years we have Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Lone Survivor (2013), and American Sniper (2014), to name only a few. For 2016, Michael Bay leads the strain of contemporary soldiers flick in 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.<br/><br/>This thrill riveting masterpiece not only captivated the lives of these six soldiers and the people trapped between this battle between the Libyan rebels, but Michael Bay did an excellent job with his use of guns and sound system that he always does so well.  This is a masterful film in almost every aspect and certainly in every way that truly matters. Maybe knowing the real life set up and cover up to these events helps elevate the appreciation of what hits the screen but the film holds up well even if a viewer is unaware of world affairs. The premeditated, brutal attack in 2012 on two United States installations in Benghazi, Libya is a dark chapter in not only the war on terror but in U.S. history in general. Expertly depicting the events surrounding those attacks with such tension and emotion is a credit to this film and those that made it. This includes the remarkable cast who each were superb in their roles. And since I am a war movie fan, so this movie has made up to my expectations. This movie is a must watch."

","This movie showed the real aspect of Benghazi. I don't know about everyone else, but where I'm from the lie told originally by Hilary Clinton that this attack on a US Ambassador and those stationed in Libya at the time was caused by some YouTube video trash talking Muhammad, was basically shoved down our throats growing up. This is an account from men and women who experienced this first hand, which entirely contradicts the false cause of some video. It is stupid that it is being shot down by critics that only have the argument that there are too many explosions and ""Michael Bay is back at it again with this overly explosive, overly patriotic retelling"". But the truth is that this was not caused by some anti-Islamic video, and this movie hints at it several times throughout in relations to the mortars having to have been set up days or weeks in advance and that it just blatantly showed that it was a direct attack on a US ambassador and many other US citizens who were there to help stop Libya from falling into terrorist control. But the thing that sickens me the most about this Leftist stated caused of some video is that Hilary Clinton personally said to the families of these men who died protecting Americans that they would get the guy who made that video. This is a fantastic movie which is not being given the chance it deserves because it is damaging to Liberals, and it is not even being discredited by facts, but by Michael Bay clichés.

When the American ambassador, Ambassador Chris Stevens(Matt Letscher) visits Benghazi, it is up to the GRS officers to protect him. However, something goes horribly wrong. The terrorists take over the diplomatic outpost. Now, it is up to the GRS military officers to protect everyone to the best of their ability & stop the terrorists at any cost. <br/><br/>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a brilliant film. The best part about this film is, despite the non-stop violence & explosions, at its core, this movie is an extremely moving drama. It is nothing like the mindless but entertaining movies, that Michael Bay has directed in the recent past. The cinematography by Dion Beebe is exquisitely frantic, in keeping with the tone of the film. This movie is not for the faint of heart because, there is a ton of violence & gory scenes in the film. There is not a single dull moment in the film. There are a number of scenes where the viewer is almost moved to tears. I love the fact that every GRS soldier is given a back story. This makes us sympathize with each & every one of them. The shootouts & explosions have been superbly executed, throughout the movie. The performances are the highlight of the film. John Krasinski is outstanding as Jack Silva. James Badge Dale is spectacular as Tyrone 'Rone' Woods. Pablo Schreiber is amazing as Kris 'Tanto' Paronto. David Denman is superb as Dave 'Boon' Benton. Dominic Fumusa is great as Chris 'Tig' Tiegen. Max Martini is impressive as Mark 'Oz' Geist. Alexia Barlier, David Costabile, Peyman Moaadi, Matt Letscher, Toby Stephens, Demetrius Grosse & David Giuntoli are awesome as Sona Jillani, Bob, Amahl, Ambassador Chris Stevens, Glen 'Bub' Doherty, DS Dave Ubben & DS Scott Wickland, respectively. 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a must watch, for everyone who loves a movie about real life heroes."
"Richie-67-485852","9","7","16","3 February 2016"," Solid 13 hours
","Most excellent military movie depicting the real deal when combat and politics mix it up. We are introduced to a group of professional soldiers who don't have super powers but do have solid training and experience to handle just about any problem that may come up in a hostile country with bad guys and no rules of engagement except killed or be killed. These boys don't boast, waste time or hesitate but instead, when it is time to rock & roll and exchange lead love letters, they have the last and final word. Just to watch this team that can operate at high level life and death dynamics and take no prisoners while creating casualties for the bad guys is riveting and respectful to watch. If we engage in gun-play and war tactics, I want to be with these guys hands down. They got your front, back and sides and they play fair too. The part in the movie where good support would make a big difference in the outcome, one cannot help but think what was the higher ups thinking who call the shots? The boots on the ground were clear, the ones who ordered those boots were not. Worth the price of a ticket, very intense for realism and highly recommend some finger food like snacks or popcorn unless you chew your nails down to stubs. No talking, texting or bathroom breaks. Let the tension have its way"

","Talk about action packed! ""13 Hours"" had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! This film tells the story based on true unimaginable, events that occurred in Benghazi in 2012. John Krasinski and James Badge Dale did an amazing job transforming into their roles as Jack Da Silva and Rone Woods. It really is incredibly the courage military men show during times of chaos and struggle. It is so commendable and it is great that stories like this are shown on the big screen so the general public can appreciate the true sacrifice these men and women give to protect our country. Michael Bay, per usual, did not disappoint with his awesome special effects and extreme stunts. A wonderful film that can be enjoyed by all!"
"peedur","9","7","16","20 January 2016"," An excellent film
","The focus of the film is on the warrior.<br/><br/>In this narrative, these are the only characters, we soon discover, who are capable of achieving anything consequential or valuable when the world goes bonkers. Smart soldiers with experience, a good grasp of human nature and huge dose of genuine valor; these are truly remarkable individuals. The film makes a gradual but serious point: the US citizens in Benghazi who survived the anarchy of the Libyan revolution owe a huge debt to the heroic qualities of these men.<br/><br/>These qualities frankly need someone with a Michael-Bay-sized extravagance to communicate their extreme contribution and heroism. I highly recommend this very well made and satisfying film."
"CherryBlossomBoy","10","3","5","29 January 2019"," Gripping
","Michael Bay can direct a bloody great film when he wants to. ""13 Hours"" is that film and it's unlike anything I've had a chance to see from him before. Leaning on the structure of ""Attack on Precinct 13"" (1976) and restricting himself from his trade-mark bombastical style, he's built a gripping account of the attack on the US embassy and the CIA outpost in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012. Why the things went down the way they did is a bit of a mistery to this day and it was even more so at the time. The reasons were lost on the CIA military detachment - all they knew for sure was that they couldn't trust anyone in the country that hosted them and were pretty much on their own to the very end. The idea to tell the story as a horror was therefore on the money. The assailants were shown coming in wave after wave, in a reckless disregard for their own lives. By all accounts that's how it actually happened. They were not portrayed as a faceless horde, though. We're not given their motivation but we are shown their human side, and reminded how loss of life is terrible, no matter what side you're on. This doesn't go to say that the film doesn't take a stand. It does. But it's not one of rampant patriotism, like one could've seen in Bay's own ""Pearl Harbor"" or Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"". It didn't try to portray the defeat as a victory. It didn't show the USA as a righteous peacekeeper. It's shown the American survivors counting their blessings for coming out alive and questioning what they've actually accomplished and what difference did they make at all. The role of the unseen decision makers at the top of the command structure was implicitly criticised as well. The question mark is even visualised with the very last shot in the film showing the Star Spangled Banner partially charred, riddled with bullet holes and submerged into the pool at the embassy. So it is a political film after all, but a quietly reserved one, concentrated on the realism and clarity of action, as well as on the human experience in the midst of all of it. It's one of a kind for Michael Bay, but also one of a kind for this decade in the passing. Almost ironic that people had to die for Hollywood to come up with something memorable."

","I walked away from this movie with several emotions. <br/><br/>In regards to simply the movie, I thought it was excellent. The actions scenes were very well put together, nothing was over the top and it all was very believable. It reminded my very much of Black Hawk Down with a touch of Saving Private Ryan for reference. I read some about the actual events that this movie is based off of and from as best as I can tell it was very true to real events. The drama, the interaction between the soldiers and the CIA field workers, the scenery and city, everything was very well done.<br/><br/>What really blew me away and made this movie really hit me was this was real. These men really went through this. They really faced this adversity, this environment, these odds against him. These men are heroes. I am so humbled there are Americans like these men that protect us, yet go unnoticed and without thanks. We would not have the freedoms we have without men and women like these individuals. It also blew me away in seeing the depiction of the local civilians and how life was for them. The fact they were in a war zone and it was simply seen as ""normal"" to them.<br/><br/>For that reason, combined with how well this movie was done, this movie an absolute must see in my book. See this movie, I promise you will walk away thankful you did."
"Rendanlovell","5","11","29","8 February 2016"," It isn't without redeeming qualities but the majority of the film is bland.
","Well, if there was ever a movie for Micheal Bay to direct outside of 'Transformers' it would be this one. It has everything that he could ever want. Explosions, buff guys, American Flags, and explosions. The only real difference between this movie and the 'Transformers' franchise is that this one lacks giant robots duking it out over who knows what. But don't be fooled, this movie isn't any more streamlined than any of his other works. At least the 'Transformers' knew that they didn't have any chance whatsoever in developing its characters. So they didn't care to try. And that is the first, and quite easily, the largest misstep that '13 Hours' makes. There just isn't anyone to cling onto to help get us through the film. Even the great John Krasinski, the charismatic mastermind behind Jim halpert struggles to find any foot hold with his character. Not one single character in this film feels different from one another. Each one is a roid raged, dislikable version of who they are suppose to be.<br/><br/>Each one is a family man with huge rippling muscles that are frequently put on display for us. And that's about it. Micheal Bay seems to have thought that putting an uncomfortable amount of man up on screen would make one forget that there wasn't anything that separated any of them. I could be wrong but....no I don't think I am actually.<br/><br/>The biggest problem isn't that these people don't feel like they actually exist but that the movie tries so hard to fake development. For a solid forty five minutes the film pushes a whole lot of nothing on its audience. We get line after line of nonsense with the occasional fake action to make you think something is happening.<br/><br/>But what whats actually happening is nothing. The more you look inward the more one realizes that the film has nothing to offer. The two and a half hour run time certainly doesn't help the films cause. It only helps to highlight even the slightest error. Of which, there are many.<br/><br/>But it wouldn't be receiving so much praise if there wasn't redeeming qualities. Surprisingly enough, the best quality the film possess is in it's action scenes. When the camera isn't shaking violently you can actually see that Bay isn't a bad director. He knows how to create an involving sequence. Bullets fly, blood is shed, and heartstrings are plucked at.<br/><br/>Another plus is the films sound editing. The sound is perfectly realistic and makes the intense action even more riveting. But I wish I could say I was impressed by more things. While, there is other minor positives nothing else is legitimately impressive. It's overlong, bloated, and devoid of any meaningful characters or messages. The action may be excellent but the film takes so crushingly long to get there that the majority of the experience is relatively bland."

But the cavalry never came, due to sheer incompetence or sheer indifference by the higher-ups.<br/><br/>Is it possible that an army of insurgents can build up without anyone in US intelligence knowing? Is it possible that the insurgent army can then attack an embassy compound and no help come at all? The movie deliberately makes no judgement and leaves it up to the viewer to decide.<br/><br/>It's an interesting illustration of our times that when these guys returned to the US, far from being lauded as heroes they were either ignored or vilified by the media.

Strange as it seems there's some people attracted to shitty patches of earth. It could be the pay is good, or it could be it next to the wild west (when it was really wild) it's just as wild (i.e. bad). So it isn't strange a certain kind of a ex-military guy might end up in such a place. Now, if you wanted another slice of danger, just for kicks, you might end up under the overall command of a CIA director who thinks he can use this job as his last ""easy out"" before retirement. What this means, largely, is to ignore all the real threats as much as possible. Stay real peaceful while still conducting some ""official"" business. That'd be good if the locals weren't a mishmash of killers armed with the spoils of Khaddafi's military weapon's cache. Sounds like a lethal pro1blem ignored until it can no longer, simply, be ignored. Never underestimate a clueless leader who has little pull in the agency he works for, let alone the needed, vastly more powerful, military.<br/><br/>This is a great movie in the mode of Blackhawk Down, just more messed up if you can believe. Best line of the entire ride, ""OK We're officially lost neither Google or Siri know where the F you are"". This puts the cluster in perspective as in boots on the ground whose own intelligence is reduced to common AI phone apps. And this debacle at Benghazi is like a giant compressed big-ass cluster. I think no matter how accurate the movie is it speaks volumes about how the most sophisticated nation with , supposedly, all the right ambitions can get caught totally off-guard. Made to look totally inept. And worse, oblivious of putting it's people open for slaughter. This is occurring as the stock holders for such as Lockheed are racking up dividends yet there's not a one of the glorious war-birds to so much as strike fear in the enemies hearts.. Get it? There is a giant disconnect in our ambitions and actions. It has a huge cost and at the top the cost is human lives<br/><br/>This movie is a must see.. Michael Bay truly delivers an important blue chip film. If one gets nothing other than a most uneasy seat of the pants wetting ride, then you're a block head as there is so much more. This is entertainment with a message. How you use it is up to you, but unless you're made of stone you will be incensed along with being glued to the story.

","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016) is a solid war film from infamous director Michael Bay. I don't love or hate Micheal Bay. I dislike a majority of the movies he puts out. His movies are loud, dumb and overblown, but at least they entertain. Going into this movie, I was very intrigued to see how Michael Bay would handle the subject matter. The 2012 attack that killed a U.S. ambassador in Libya has become a very controversial and politically driven subject matter. Does Michael Bay create a very thought provoking political war film? No. Does Michael Bay create an entertaining war film with some great action? Yes. '13 Hours' has great action grounded in realism. Every action sequence is believable and exhilarating. The actors in the movie do a solid job, and there is certainly chemistry between them. My biggest problem with the movie is that it just oozes with all the stereotypes found in every Michael Bay movie. Unnecessary slow motion, out of place humor,etc. While this is certainly one of Michael Bay's best films, it still suffers from the same problems as his other movies do.'13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi' is entertaining, but it has more things going against it than for it."

I am just made this conclusion by watching the results of this ""protection"". As Wikipedia says: On 19 March, the first act of NATO allies to secure the no-fly zone by destroying Libyan air defences began when French military jets entered Libyan airspace on a reconnaissance mission heralding attacks on enemy targets. In the weeks that followed, American forces were in the forefront of NATO operations against Libya. More than 8,000 American personnel in warships and aircraft were deployed in the area. At least 3,000 targets were struck in 14,202 strike sorties, 716 of them in Tripoli and 492 in Brega. The American air offensive included flights of B-2 Stealth bombers, each bomber armed with sixteen 2000-pound bombs, flying out of and returning to their base in Missouri on the continental United States. Clearly the support provided by the NATO air-forces was pivotal in the ultimate success of the revolution"" - This means no jurisdiction? No jurisdiction my a...<br/><br/>Or this one ""And I believe that it is our mission as Americans to help Benghazans form a free, democratic and prosperous Libya"" - seriously? After Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria?. No simple words how all this bs started in Libya. Bottom line - a good movie with good dose of modern propaganda. Gaddafi was a bad guy, no question. But when US or NATO says things like ""we must support the rebels and democracy"" and suddenly they are very well prepared for ""no-fly zones"" and air-strikes.

I'm just going to tell you what I think about this film as a piece of work. Michael Bay and Chuck Hogan did a great job in bringing this story to film. They showed the courage these soldiers had in protecting Americans no matter what they were told to do or not to do. This film was action packed and intense at times and the drama it brought hit hard when it came to one of the soldiers leaving his wife and kids at home to do his job and when some of the soldiers themselves got hurt or saw some of their fellow soldiers get hurt or killed sacrificing themselves to make sure fellow Americans were safe.

","I expected nothing when I watched this and had no preconceived ideas about the Bengazi attacks. All I knew about the incident was that 4 Americans had died and nobody had a good answer why. <br/><br/>If I had to compare any other movies to it, I'd say ""Blackhawk Down"" and ""Hamburger Hill"" with a dash of ""Navy Seals"". The movie has nominally engaging characters, however at over two and a half hours long, it could have been cut much tighter. You could safely start watching the movie at the 40 minute mark and miss nothing much. If you roll your eyes during the personal stuff in action movies I'd say just do that. The first portion of ""13 hours"" is spent on character development and building tension. (Angry Libyans, a jackass of a CIA chief who doesn't believe there's any threat, buildings that have no security barriers, indifferent and underpaid Libyan guards, not enough weapons and so on). However the first 40 minutes doesn't do anything to add enough to the story not to just skip over it. The character development is clumsy and trite, the dialogue is of the comic-book variety, and in all that screen time you barely learn enough to be able to tell one character from another, sometimes. <br/><br/>When the action starts though, it is very good. Enough to say the fire-fights in ""13 Hours"" probably aren't going to be like anything you've seen before.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Given that his last ""true"" story movie was Pearl Harbor (2001), and he is best known for the endless stream of Transformers movies (yes, another one is on the way), it's understandable how we could be apprehensive (to say the least) about director Michael Bay taking on the Benghazi story. A sigh of relief is in order as the film pays tribute to those who deserve it while still providing Bay the opportunity to blow stuff up, and display is always-annoying tendencies with a camera.<br/><br/>The incredibly courageous soldiers, who comprised the CIA security team (GRS) of contractors that saved many lives, are the heroes of the story and heroes in real life. Bay never loses focus on their bravery and dedication, and avoids the temptation of taking an obvious political stance in telling their story. At the same time, he doesn't shy away from making a weaslley CIA administrator type (played by David Constable) the face of bureaucratic incompetence.<br/><br/>The six man team is played in the movie by John Krasinski (as Jack Silva), James Badge Dale (beefed up from his ""Pacific"" days as Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods), Pablo Schreiber (as Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto), David Denman (as Dave ""Boon"" Benton), Dominic Fumusa (as John ""Tig"" Tiegen), and Max Martini (as Mark ""Oz"" Geist). All six actors are clearly proud to represent these men, and though wise-cracks abound, there is absolutely no Hollywood preening or posturing  these are gritty, well-trained, dedicated warriors.<br/><br/>So much as been written and debated about what happened during the 2012 siege that resulted in the tragic deaths of four Americans, including that of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. But given the reputations of those in the CIA and the State Department, it's doubtful full disclosure will ever replace the holes of doubt that exist, so studying the action sequences makes sense  though we also get a Joseph Campbell reference. Chuck Hogan adapted Mitchell Zuckoff's book for the film, and in between the rapid gun fire and missiles, that deafening silence you hear is Washington, D.C."

","I don't know an exorbitant amount about the events that transpired September 11, 2012. The things I do know are disputed left and right by various talking heads, politicians and supposed experts none of which were actually there. What I do know is the biases you have towards the subject matter will invariably inform your ability to like this movie. Therefore I would like to sidestep the debate of the film's accuracy and instead focus on the movie as a piece of art.<br/><br/>The story begins with Jack Silva (Krasinski) as our introduction to Benghazi just after the revolution. He lands at the airport and is greeted by friend and brother in arms 'Rone' (Dale). From there they drive to the CIA annex headed by bureaucratic nancy-boy CIA Chief Bob (Costabile). Their mission: keep CIA assets safe while they locate and eliminate Muammar Gaddafi's weapons arsenals before they are sold to terrorists. Things however go sour shortly after the arrival of Ambassador Chris Stevens (Letscher) a ""true believer"" in diplomacy and progress. On the anniversary of 9/11, a group of terrorists storm the American Diplomatic compound where Ambassador Stevens is held up; the only people available to save them are Jack, Rone and their stable of ex-military contractors.<br/><br/>13 Hours is not very good; as a piece of art, as a piece of non- fiction, as a piece of entertainment. In fact the only type of piece it is I dare not say and the fault of that lies squarely on director Michael Bay. Throughout his illustrious career, Bay has made a compendium of high-octane action-thrillers that have, for better or worse, changed the grammar of action movies for an entire generation. What he does on purpose, he does well; that is to say cater to the lowest common denominator and make things go boom real good.<br/><br/>Yet what he does unintentionally is hold an entire audience hostage and exhausts them with a cavalcade of explosions and loud noises. To break the cacophony, he adds moments of familial and brotherly dialogues that could have worked if his constant cutting and dynamic camera movements didn't make everything look and feel phoned-in. In fact every scene where someone isn't shooting, there is a complete lack of tension. At one point Silva comments to Rone that he hates the wait in-between shelling and gunfire; ""Your adrenaline starts to slow and your mind starts to wonder."" Brother I feel for you.<br/><br/>Krasinski, Dale, Schreiber and the rest do their best with a nuts- and-bots script. Despite every important character sporting a bushy beard and flexing serious muscle, they fleshed their characters out just enough to make them interesting. I wish I could say the same thing for everyone outside of the group of contractors. Costabile gets the short end of the stick playing the pompous, weak-willed CIA Chief who has shades of Walter Peck of Ghostbusters (1984) fame. At one point he snarls at Silva saying, ""we have people who graduated from Harvard and Yale here...Do your job and stay out of our way."" I don't know what callous jock tied him to the flagpole in high school but there is no way that kind of sourpuss would be working for the CIA. Him and the rest of the CIA analysts act like a spiteful chess team facing off against a team of iconoclastic football quarterbacks. Even in extraordinary situations they preen and complain; that is until they get a sample of the contractors ""manliness"". That's when they fall in line in performances so needlessly one-note that they all might as well be mannequins.<br/><br/>I may have given this movie a pass if it had just a hint of insidious meta-text like Bay's slapdash crime story Pain & Gain (2013). Alas the man has fallen back on old tricks; at one point depicting the same clockwise-counterclockwise epic shot he's used to rub vigorously into his audiences faces. There is no parable in the chaos like the far superior Black Hawk Down (2001). There is not an emotional core like there was in Lone Survivor (2013). There is no political theme, patriotic rebel-rousing or point; just Bayhem."

What an insult to the real heroes. The men that save lives without a question, that put their own lives at risk for their brothers and who they are charged to protect. The men that work in the shadows and take no credit and you have no idea about what they've done or sacrificed for you and this country. Those men are the ones that would be the guys to pull off a 9/11 conspiracy if there was one...these are the guys that are Americas hired guns, the ones that do the secret special work.. And I'm sure that if any of those guys knew that any one was planning to kill innocent people they would have been willing to die to stop it.. That's these guys. Not some robotic ninjas that somehow would help our government fly three planes into buildings..They are warriors , heroes. And deserve the ultimate respect. We should all consider that..

We cast a parting sorrowful glance at the mothers of the enemy crying over the bodies of their braves. We get to understand that omission is as much a part of this as cowboy courage, that the whole thing is overseen by calculating minds from afar. We don't get to see how the tribal viper's nest was poked by these overseers in a bid to remove Qaddafi. <br/><br/>But I have another response that outlasts all this in my mind, let me paint a picture. With these movies we fly over wartorn lands that have been devastated in innumerable ways, a sea of malaise stretching from Iraq to Libya. We swoop from above to find the handful of Americans wherever they are, wrongly or not, stay for the battle, see their courage, and fly off again with the bodies of fallen heroes. <br/><br/>There's a vast discrepancy here that doesn't wash with me. Between how precious and celebratory life is on one side and how wretched and nameless on the other. Between single lives of CIA contractors and the unwashed multitude.

"tjgoalie13","5","13","46","15 January 2016"," A Ver Patriotic, But Complex, and Clichéd Film.
","Michael Bay in every film he's done has shown that he bleeds red, white, and blue, so go into this film knowing it's very patriotic. For those who want a war film that is patriotic, action-packed, and honors its heroes stop reading, because this is the film you want to see. For those looking for a great war film, 13 Hours is an action packed film, that offers little clarity on the complex subject, and is filled with clichés. My opinion is this film came way too early, and if this film had been made in 5 to 10 years, the story would have been more fleshed out.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a great director when it comes to framing and shooting action sequences, this film showcases that. The film is loaded with action and uses very effective practical effects, making every explosion feel and look real. For a war film, it has a pretty good sense of humor, which helps lighten up the mood at times, and the performances are spot on. As well the film does a great job honoring the heroes of that day, in essence, it's a very patriotic film.<br/><br/>However, for those looking for a film that was going to delve into the controversial story of what happened on September 11th, 2012, and give clarity, this film doesn't do that. In fact, the storytelling in this film is quite weak. The first act of the plot focuses too much on irrelevant subplots that dilute the film, and glosses over crucial moments, like for instance why the fighter jets in Italy didn't come for assistance. The film ends up being, even more, confusing because the filmmakers were too afraid to offend either political party that is eagerly watching the impact of this film. <br/><br/>Another problem the film suffers, independent from the fear of political ramifications is the fact that the film is loaded with clichés. On top of that many of the characters, are either clichéd stereotypes or underdeveloped. Even more disappointing is that the terrorist characters are weak, as the film doesn't go in depth on who they are, or why they attack the consulate in the first place. So the true story of 6 brave heroes, becomes more of a shallow action/war film, and less a true story about these heroes. <br/><br/>In the end, for those who want to see this movie because it's a true story about 6 soldiers who courageously fought to protect American lives, in hostile Libya, this film won't disappoint. For those who want a film that tells a story that is well-crafted and easy to follow, while delving into the ever complex details, this isn't that. This film is still very patriotic, and it seems as though that's the biggest reason to see this movie, not to politicize, but to honor heroes, both fallen and alive. It's truly a discretionary call on whether or not to see this film."

","I had high hopes for this one, i really did. Michael Bay's best is what i kept hearing, so i thought hey maybe it will break through the typical Michael Bay stereotype, which it does and doesn't at the same time. I will explain what i mean later on but in short i found myself bored to be honest. I was thinking to myself about all the other things i could be doing which isn't how i want to feel during a movie. <br/><br/>I would compare my view on 13 hours to that of M. Night Shamylan's 'The Visit'. Completely different films but hear me out. Both films were described as the director's return to form. I watched both and by the end i wasn't sold on either of them. I came out feeling 'that was alright, but to be honest doesn't sell me that this director will be making great movies again in the future'. Bay's films are bad but i enjoyed films such as the first Transformers, heck i even enjoy Bad Boys II. They are stupid but a lot of fun. What Bay has tried to do here is make a serious Biopic, he did Pain and Gain and probably realised it was a bad idea to make it a comedy, but making a drama like this just comes across as boring and you cant even have fun with the ""badness"" because here he tries too hard to be serious which is fine to do in a movie, but Bay doesn't really know how to do it well. I mean, it is a good story and a real life event involving Benghazi soldiers and the death of an ambassador which could have translated well. But making it 2 hrs 24 minutes, not a great deal happened and a lot of it was filler.<br/><br/>At times in the movie we are watching something really exciting and i think, the movie really could redeem itself here, then the next scene is something really boring that i wasn't interested in. This happens for the entire runtime which is almost like watching 2 different films. One scene involves the main character running across a battlefield in slow motion with a beautiful sunset behind him whilst things are constantly exploding behind him. To me it perfectly describes Bay as a director. Brilliant style, poor substance. The film wasn't terrible, but nothing overly memorable happens which has me sold that he is a good filmmaker either, so in the end it's just an average film that doesn't stand among the rest of the true story films out today."

But it is so emotionally involving I found myself with my fist in my mouth most of the time. Michael Bay may have his faults, but he knows how to move an audience--to laughter and to tears.

"StevePulaski","6","10","34","15 January 2016"," For those who want the experience and not the baggage
","Perhaps Michael Bay was one of the better directors that could've handled an action film that depicted the hellish events that occurred in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, which resulted in the deaths of four men, including the United States Libyan Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Rather than bringing a politicized agenda or approaching this story by showing the closeted safety of government buildings where hasty conversations more than certainly took place, Bay thrusts himself on the frontlines with this picture, intent on documenting the chaotic, tragic, and horrifying events that occurred there and follow the men who often get left out of the conversation. No matter what side of the political spectrum you fall on, you almost can't disagree with the tragic circumstances that unfolded on that September day.<br/><br/>With ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,"" Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan focuses on the titular men who came to the U.S. embassy's rescue in Libya when the compound housing Christopher Stevens and numerous others came under attack by terrorists. The story centers around Jack Da Silva (John Krasinski, who gives a strong central performance in an unlikely role), a family man with a wife and two children, who finds himself sent into Benghazi with numerous familiar faces in order to protect the ambassador and assure security in the embassy. When Stevens' bullet-proof compound is swarmed by violent Libyans, any conceivable plan is lost and Da Silva and his squadmates are forced to act largely on impulse in order to live to see rescue from a distant airport, or at least the sunrise again.<br/><br/>Hogan spends the first fifty minutes building up to the inevitable, showing the men arriving in Benghazi, hanging out with one another, in addition to Stevens arriving with other CIA members that would eventually come to meet their fate upon having their compound attacked. During this time, we see that both Bay and Hogan aren't really intent on setting up these soldiers as characters, nor are they very interested in any of their backstories save for Da Silva's and his disillusionment with not seeing his kids as frequently as he'd like. While this is undoubtedly a problem for a project that has these men in the subtle of the film, Bay and Hogan's intentions become more and more clear as the film progresses.<br/><br/>By the time the compound is attacked and the soldiers flee to the embassy for protection and to protect it, it's clear that Bay and Hogan are interested in depicting the chaos and the unbelievably tragic circumstances that took place in Benghazi during these thirteen hours more than anything else. Rather than focusing on a politicized narrative, both men remain respectful to the titular soldiers in their depiction, but also the Libyan citizens. The film even ends on a fairly daring note to recognize the humanity of the other side, even the enemy, in multiple respects, before ultimately concluding on a note that is incredibly considerate and respectful of all involved.<br/><br/>Bay's directorial gracefulness comes through in this film more than in any project I've yet to see from him, and that's likely because he's aware he's walking on eggshells. Turning the events of the Benghazi terrorist attack into an action film is already a very risky idea, and coupled with the fact that Bay is often cited as one of the worst directors working today certainly doesn't assist his credibility or his ambition any more. Instead of opting for his usual flash-in-the-pan, sound and light show combined with a mind-numbing amalgamation of sensory annihilation and noise pollution, Bay opts for an angle that showcases the violence of this attack with a strong sense of visual clarity.<br/><br/>Make no mistake in judging ""13 Hours"" too quickly, however, for its repetition in showcasing the violence of the attack does have the ability to wear on the viewer. While Bay's approach is admirably constant and never uneven, the excessive violence becomes interchangeable, especially when there are no characters attached to the bodies that are just so haphazardly flying around and collapsing before our eyes.<br/><br/>The jingoism from ""American Sniper"" is absent, although the coldness and emphasis on amorality in a time of complete and total chaos from ""Fury"" is missing, as well. ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,"" as a result, stands in a class all its own in terms of being respectful and cognizant of its characters and the real-life individuals involved, though it can't help but fall prey to the weakest of war movie conventions. With all that being said, between this and ""Pain & Gain,"" I, for one, can officially say I'm excited for the new projects Bay has been taking on and will hopefully continuing taking on in the future. This is the perfect film to complement a potential neo-Bay revolution."

","This movie is basically a Repop of American Sniper, just a different time and place. Fresh faces, guns and bullets. I found it to be lackluster. I will credit the movie with not once mentioning Hillary's name, but you walk away with a bad taste in your mouth.. Something Hillary is definitely familiar with. Its another conservative, right wing, Ultra Gun Nut ""Gone with the Wind."" And its not a classy one like We Were Soldiers or The Deer Hunter. Like Sicario, it stereotypes an entire nation of people when the aggression is coming from a smaller group of terrorists. Maybe its not my kind of movie because I am rooted in facts and not fantasy when it comes to worldly affairs? Also several of my friends found it disappointing as well."

","I personally don't think this contains any spoilers, but just to be safe, I checked the Contains Spoilers box. This movie was awesome! The actors were great for the story.

I can't wait for it to come out for buy, because I will definitely be buying a copy for myself, as well as others. The only thing I didn't like about the movie is the fact that Hillary Clinton's part in Benghazi, was not included in the story line somewhere, besides the reference to the fake video story she lied about. I already hated Hillary for the Benghazi attack, as well as all the other things she stands for, BUT after watching this, and the interviews with the soldiers, I absolutely despise Hillary Clinton! She should not be running for President right now! She should be in prison (Guantanamo Bay for helping the terrorist), OR dead!!! I hope and pray justice is served for all of those people who died in Benghazi that day! And for all of you people who think the CIA's orders to ""stand down"" is false, please do research! Preferably not from liberal media, but from an unbiased source. *Also, at the end, the captions about the real life soldiers, go pretty fast, so hard to read every bit of it. I'm not a fast reader, but I'm also not a slow reader. I wasn't the only one who couldn't keep up with the captions.* I recommend everyone see this movie! Thank You all for making a movie of this true story for the whole world to see! Most importantly, thank you to all the soldiers who had to fight in Benghazi that day!

"kdavies-69347","5","7","23","6 June 2016"," Pumped up Military Propaganda
","After a string of action films of debatable success, Michael Bay brings us yet another fast paced action film full of the usual U.S propaganda and militaristic rhetoric.<br/><br/>Theme-wise, and just as an action film, sure this movie has your typical action packed sequence of events. Explosions, violence, blood, and death by the dozens from beginning to end. Maybe that's enough for the majority of viewers to feel like they're watching something worthwhile, and if that's all you want, then by all means enjoy this Ramboesque montage of death and destruction. It certainly gets you pumped up, and dramatizes the camaraderie between the soldiers that form the core group in this movie. Their military hardware, wide array of weaponry, and well honed physiques certainly intensifies that feeling of power and superiority, making the life of a mercenary seem like a glorious way to make a living and friendship. It is certainly full of great action, with a cast that plays well off each other (3 of the actors were all in 'The Office '2005-2013' so they had plenty of experience). There is a nice consistent tension throughout the film, and the film focuses on the danger that the U.S citizens are in by keeping a fast pace with loads of violence. <br/><br/>Once you get past all that superficial nonsense, the movie is pretty god-awful at times. It's tries to portray itself as a hero film, similar to that of ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), and even goes so far as to mention that film as the current situation that they are in. But this movie is certainly is doing its best to copy the situation. American personal, trapped behind enemy lines, with overwhelming numbers against them... it's a huge carbon copy, just without the helicopters, and a smaller central cast. I mean, kudos to the screenwriter who points out the similarity between the film, and was cheeky enough to put that in the dialogue, but if you're going to copy a film, perhaps is best not to mention it (only because Black Hawk was a much better film in so many ways). <br/><br/>Likewise, the movie is heralded as a true story from the beginning. However, several eye-witness accounts have mentioned that this movie is far off the mark from what really happened in the course of the 13 hour siege on the CIA base in Libya. So much so that the CIA operative who was in charge of the base at the time, issued a press release shortly after the film's premiere, criticizing the film as a ""distortion of events."" The situation stems from the military contractors adamantly saying they received stand down orders, when no such orders were given. The dramatization of events isn't anything new in film, but if you're going to take a whole lot of leeway with true events, then you can't really call it a 'true story' anymore. Of course, it all depends on who you believe, but if the movie and book aren't based on the facts, they are therefore, untrue. However the movie isn't a lesson on failed policies, or truth. It's an action flick, so it's up to the viewer to make up their own mind about what happened that day. If you want to create a pumped up action film, then stick to that and don't call it a true story. I'm not sure that this movie pays tribute to the life of U.S senator John Christopher Stevens in a way that honors his sacrifice for his country. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a solid action film, and Michael Bay does his thing well. He really drives home the fact that, despite what happened that day, America still kicks ass. <br/><br/>'Murica! <br/><br/>5/10"
"RforFilm","5","6","19","20 January 2016"," 13 Hours is not a serious geopolitical story, but rather a serviceable action war story
","Most Americans have the notion that they have the greatest military and strategic force. Combining their strength, training, and overwhelmingly patriotic attitude, and a solider is supposedly no match for a Taliban or a member of ISIS. The heart seems to be in the right place, but often we forgot to consider the hearts of those that are not American. I'm also a supporter of the strong military defenses and the people that fill those dirty boots. Though now that I've studied abroad, I've gotten a better idea that most countries have their own patriotic slogans with none that read, ""We're number two!"".<br/><br/>It's not just the military bases that are all over the world, but the various CIA, FBI and simple representatives of the U.S.A. that are so frequent, that it's no wonder that they've gotten the nickname, ""police of the world"". In a way, it's true as they are seemingly ready for any kind of attack or initiative to help regardless if help from America is wanted. One such response came from Islamic militia's when they assaulted on two American compounds in Benghazi in 2012, including one where the U.S. Ambassador lived. Their story is told by Michael Bay in 13 Hours.<br/><br/>In early 2012, Navy SEAL Jack Da Silva (played by John Krasinski) is returning to Benghazi to take up a security post for the nearby CIA Annex along with six other SEALS whose job is to be ""last responders"" to any trouble that their building or the nearby ambassador may be facing. The country of Libya has just gone through a revolution that has taken down a long-standing dictator. One vice has been traded for another as various gangs have seized control of the former dictators weapons, turning Benghazi into a warzone as several sides fight to claim the city in their honors.<br/><br/>Even with an incident arriving into the country, Jack and the other security team don't face much trouble until September 11th. The day is being remembered for the tragedies that happened in 2001, but local Islamic groups have decided to use this day to make their mark. The ambassador's house is attacked and the security team there is overwhelmed by groups that we would later identify as the early ISIS. Jack is scrambling with the other guys as they hear from their leader Tyrone Woods (played by James Badge Dale) that he wants the guys to defy their rules in order to try and save the ambassador. <br/><br/>A story like 13 Hours seems like the kind of serious geopolitical story that would have caught the interest of Kathryn Bigelow or Clint Eastwood. But it surprised me that Michael Bay, whose mostly known for his Transformers movies, wanted to take a stab at this historical story. His first attempt at a historical story, Pearl Harbor, suffered from inaccuracies, childish dialogue, and a romance that had nothing to do with the actual event. None of that (almost none...there is still some silly writing) is evident here as Michael Bay has decidedly gone with a more ""fact-for-fact"" basis. <br/><br/>The ""fact-for-fact"" definition is what probably happened during the attacks. So for those that were hoping for more on the political issue, you'll be disappointed. At least Bay does put his focus on the attacks, which actually do have some well staged war action. Action fans will probably be satisfied, though one thing was missing for me that this movie really needed; relatable characters. Most of the six solders are all the same ""macho military"" stereotypes that do little to distinguish themselves (it doesn't help that all of them have beards, making it hard to tell them apart).<br/><br/>I'll give this five Libyan flags out of ten. I was surprised with how mature Michael Bay is trying to be with this real life story. It's a shame he still can't shake off his bad writers from giving him a suitable screenplay that might give him a bigger chance to shine. 13 Hours is a serviceable action film rather then a genuine look into a major political issue on the right of the U.S. to be in a place where their not wanted. I might have been closer to enjoying this had it been twenty minutes shorter. I can't give it too much trouble for trying it's hardest and giving us something rather then nothing."

It's graphic in parts, but not gratuitously so and I had no idea it was a true story, until the end, which made it all the more poignant. The bravery of these Americans is just incredible - one man in particular. No requisite Love interest I'm afraid, just their fellow Americans, which I found refreshing. This is a must see war movie. The story is well known, a gang of American soldiers and Seals are trapped and surrounded at a compound in Benghazi, repelling hundreds of armed Libyan fighters, whilst saving the lives of many people.

","I was riveted, spellbound by this, watching what I have read come to life on the screen.
""Powerful people"" tried to stop the distribution of this film and I can see why. There is even one or more bad reviews because it shows a truth that the Progressive Liberal Stalinist Democrats want to hide, that a whole bunch of Americans were in a war zone, not some peaceful place as we were told, and that they were improperly supplied, poorly secured, and there was no backup for them. Also, that there was either the biggest screwup in intelligence since Pearl Harbor, or the Secretary of State ignored it to save a couple bucks. Security should never be left to an organization like the February 17th Martyrs Brigade, who not only knew of the attack and ran away, but some were identified through surveillance photographs as part of the assault force.<br/><br/>The film also exposes the idea that the attack on 9/11/2012 was a spontaneous event resulting from a demonstration about some anti-Islamic film. It was obviously a well planned and coordinated attack carried out in waves. That is obvious by the accuracy of mortars used and availability of heavy machine guns. <br/><br/>In closing, never forget J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone S. Woods. In addition, do not forget the wounded and the rest who lived through that hell. And never forget that neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama have ever publicly apologized or accepted responsibility for putting them in that situation and failing to act to defend them. And never forget that Ambassador Stevens' itinerary in a hostile area was transmitted in an email on an unsecure server by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."

📜 Plot : Based on real life events ,post the Death and end of Dictatorship of Gadafi in Libya, there is still chaos in the country and when an attack happens on an US compound, a contracted security team of ex militants struggle to keep CIA team safe and find ways out of the chaps.

👨‍⚖️ Review : 13 hours is an iconic recreation of true life events by the master of action movies Michael Bay. I believe he is only one true legend who could have done this. 13 hours is visually stunning, engaging and a true masterpiece of an action film. The Movie is 140min long representation of what happened in the 13 hours of war between the CIA and Ansar al Sharia Terrorists on 11 September 2012.<br/><br/>The characters played by John (Jack) and James (Rone) , Pablo (Tanto) stick with you after the movie has ended as their personalities are perfectly portrayed by the actors. The Comradry and relationships between the soldiers, the willing to fight for the country no matter what, promises made to families to come back safe all these make you numb and touch your hearts in its core.<br/><br/>My favourite was the brotherhood of Jack and Rone which sets the movie apart. The Patriotism and Mood of the movie lifts up your spirits on how these soldiers never gave up , never surrendered and kept the war on for 13 long hours in an unknown territory with no backup. Hats off to those Soldiers and Hats off to Michael Bay for recreating this Historic yet tragic event in chapters of War by Men.

"jamesrupert2014","7","0","0","6 May 2020"," Reasonably good, action-drenched depiction of the 2012 Benghazi attack
","Following an attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, a group of CIA operatives and private military contractors mount a bloody defence of a CIA outpost against mobs of heavily armed jihadists. I have no experience by which to judge 'combat' scenes in films but the battles in this seemed realistic, and were certainly exiting and well done. Director Bey (whom I associate with sophomoric action-adventure fluff and with crap such as 'Armageddon' (1998) and 'Pearl Harbour' (2001)), reins himself in somewhat, and other than a couple of trite 'slow motion, back-lit, group-walks toward the camera' and a gimmicky freeze-frame shot of a mortar shell descending followed by a Forrest Gump-style image of a singed baby-picture floating though the smoke, eschews his usual over-the-top pyrotechnics. The cast is fine (admittedly I found most of the main characters more-or-less interchangeable), as was the script/story, (although a bit too many tough-guy, bro-binding exchanges and family-time cutaways designed to humanise the rugged (American) bearded-killers). The jihadi bearded-killers don't get much back-story as they are methodically mowed down but I found the final scenes of their families coming to mourn to be more affecting than the corresponding scenes in the CIA compound. The film has some similarities to Ridley Scott's superior 'Black Hawk Down' (2001) but lacks the palpable tension that Scott deftly builds in his story of desperate, out-numbered, elite fighting men. The historical accuracy of the film has been debated but considering the players involved, what really happened may never be made public. All-in-all, watchable (for fans of this kind of border-line jingoism) and not bad for a Michael Bey opus (and a great ad for armoured Mercedes Benzes)."

"Fluke_Skywalker","7","0","0","25 June 2019"," It's Bay, for better and for worse
","Michael Bay is the directing equivalent of a mobile, big-armed quarterback w/a gunslinger's mentality. He passes the eye test, and on any given play he can do things that dazzle the senses. But also on any given play he can do things that leave you scratching your head. And so it is W/13 Hours, a more serious subject than Bay normally tackles.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Bay does an excellent job of dropping you into the harrowing ordeal w/the characters. At times you feel as if you're pinned down there w/them. But Bay can't overcome his bad habits and worst instincts.<br/><br/>For one, it's a tad bloated at nearly 2 1/2 hours. Bay, for all of his commercial, mainstream success, has always delivered films that are far longer than they need to be. Here the length can be forgiven a bit, as the subject warrants more depth than, say, transforming cars, but it would've benefitted from a little narrative tightening. The film also features Bay's penchant for broad, buddy cop-style humor. Soldiers certainly use humor as a coping mechanism in the heat of battle, but too often here the jokes and one-liners feel at odds w/the tone of the rest of the material.<br/><br/>I don't know what Bay's politics are, but he doesn't use this as a political vehicle as so many of his contemporaries do, to the detriment of their storytelling. Make no mistake, there is a story w/political implications to be told here, but not from the boots on the ground side of the story. This is the story of Brave men who stepped up and proved their mettle against incredible odds and that is wisely the focus of this good but never great movie."

"bowmanblue","4","4","12","23 June 2017"," 13 Hours – yup, that's about right
","Sometimes a film's title really does tip you off as to what it's going to be about. 'Snakes on a Plane' is one such example. What you see is what you get. '13 Hours' is another. Having watched it, I can definitely confirm that it felt like I had wasted 13 hours of my life watching this. And that's a shame. Despite Michael Bay's notorious reputation since his stint at the helm of the infamous 'Transformers' franchise, I still think he's a reasonably good director (I am just about the only person alive who enjoyed his 'Pain and Gain' film!) so, when I heard he was directing a film about hired security officers in the Middle East, I thought it would be worth a watch.<br/><br/>Now, you can probably tell I wasn't impressed and I feel I should probably start listing the various reasons as to why I felt this way. However, I can sum it up in one word: boring. And I could probably leave the review there. I didn't think it was terrible, just boring. 'The Office's' John Krasinski plays the lead security officer and, if you've seen him taking fire from Michael Scott, then you'll probably know that he can hold his own in dangerous situations. He's – as predicted – a likable character who you always feel like you could probably share a beer with. But the film was still boring. Yes, it does show us westerners a window into what life must be like in Middle Eastern countries and what Westerners have to go through when living/working there. The scenery is certainly nice and interesting to look at – certainly a change from watching films set in New York or other recognisable locations. And there is definitely a gritty undertone to the whole story. You can feel the dirt and danger these people have to go through on a daily basis. But I was still bored. Yup, there are some – sort of – car chases and gunfights. These are naturally well executed (in true Michael Bay style), but I've seen all these before and, yes, I was bored.<br/><br/>Overall, '13 Hours' is a nice (and dare I say 'accurate?') portrayal of what life must be like in that unstable region of the world, but, ultimately, despite its good points, it just didn't grab me. I was bored (although I'm guessing that this was still better than 'Transformers 5: The Last Knight!')."

","With all the political stuff flying around, Hillary and the emails. This movie shows up.<br/><br/>(save you time reading, the movie is a knuckle biting action thriller Go See It)<br/><br/>I'm going to reveal the real spoiler........what the cover up was all about.<br/><br/>There were weapons lost.....there was a stand down.....but that is not what I believe this event was all about.<br/><br/>The real loss and tragedy was the covered up assassination of an American Ambassador. After seeing the movie it was clear to me what this was all about. Libya was cut off from the world, sort of like Cuba was for 40 years. In this child like state there was a country that could be molded into anything. Political clay of sorts.<br/><br/>In walks a very charismatic likable man with a desire to change Libya for the better, the ambassador had worked teaching English in Muslim countries while a youth in the Peace Core. He was a true believer and a boy scout like person.....he never got the State Department memo...The the middle east was to be let fall into chaos......<br/><br/>The greatest loss was that of hope....<br/><br/>U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens....is an un-sung hero. A man who wanted to make the world a better place, not knowing that his loss was a message to the rest of the politicians how things are going to go down in that part of the world and if you don't go along with the plan...........<br/><br/>I want to thank Michael Bay and the cast and crew. For making a movie that pulls us in, entertains and tells a story.<br/><br/>I don't buy movies....I'll be buying this one....I'll be going to see Michael Bay movies in the theater from now on. This movie helps to heal a broken world."
"leonblackwood","7","3","8","26 August 2016"," Intense and very entertaining! 7/10
","Review:  I surprisingly, really enjoyed this film, because it felt like you was one of the soldiers fighting for your life, and the intensity throughout, was brilliant. The director cleverly spent some time to let the audience get to know the various soldiers and he gave an in depth look into there different tactics in combat. I was a bit skeptical when I saw that it was nearly 2 and a half hours long but it really needed to be, and the fact that it was based on true events, made it a truly amazing story. Rone (James Badge Dale), was a true leader, and he pushed his heroic soldiers to the limit to save his fellow Americans. The chemistry between the actors made the movie seem real, and the way that the movie was shot, especially in combat, was great. Jack Silva (John Krasinski), wasn't the most charismatic soldier but he didn't crumble under pressure, mainly because he knew that his squad would die for each other. When I saw the real soldiers at the end, I did find it touching and quite emotional, and it's obvious that the tragic events that happened in Benghazi over those 13 hours, must have been traumatic, because a lot of the soldiers retired afterwards. Anyway, I personally found this film really entertaining and it should have made more money at the box office. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This epic war movie was directed by Michael Bay, 51, who has made some decent movies like Pain & Gain, which I really enjoyed, The Transformers franchise, The Island, Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, The Rock and the Bad Boys franchise. He is due to release the next Transformers movie, The Last Knight, in 2017 with Mark Wahlberg and Josh Duhamel, so he's obviously one to deal with big budgets and working with big stars. Judging by his other movies, he decided to keep this true story extremely raw and he picked the right cast to portray this remarkable story.    Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $70million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama/thrillers starring John Krasinski, Pablo Schreiber, James Badge Dale, David Denman and Dominic Fumusa. 7/10"

","The structure of characters is desperate. You have big boys (literally) and surely it must equate to high testosterone levels too. They needed someone to throw their cool lines at and so comes Bob (David Costabile), who was necessarily turned into the only antagonist for its sake. And Sona (Alexia Barlier) was strategically placed in it just so there's an attractive female visual who's only job was to complain.<br/><br/>I don't usually see error in films but this one is probably isn't so subtle. In between the car chase with the rebels, the fire on the hood of the car seemed to turn off and on in between takes. <br/><br/>And another thing, when you're specifically told to turn left, you do, but they didn't. I mean when your life depended on it, it's a really stupid thing to do. Why so?

I don't know how close to the truth this film is, I find it difficult to believe six guys with a never ending supply of ammunition could hold off and beat what looked like an army of terrorists. OK I know it's based on a true story but maybe that truth as been stretched somewhat. I mean why even make a film about it in the first place except to tell the world once again how Americans always win the war (I mean look at what they have done with history and WW2) or even if they didn't but let's make it look like they did (see any film about Vietnam). Having said all of that, if you are looking for another shoot 'em up movie in the genre of 'Black Hawk Down', Rambo and the like then this is for you. I give it 5 stars for that and that alone.

"themadmovieman","7","4","13","31 January 2016"," A genuinely exciting thriller, but way too long
","Michael Bay, the director of the infamously bad Transformers series, has come up with a genuinely exciting, tense and engaging thriller with 13 Hours. It's no masterpiece by any means, and suffers from poor pacing and an occasional lack of depth, but all in all, with a ton of thrilling action sequences throughout, this is the sort of film that Bay should be making, because really is an entertaining and impressive watch.<br/><br/>The events of the film are based on a true story from September 2012. Therefore, the film is dealing with extremely recent history as it looks at the aftermath of the Libyan revolution, but it manages to portray it with assurance and intelligence. Although the political situation becomes secondary to the action in the latter half, the insight that this film has into the instability in the Middle East is very interesting, and manages to provide a lot more intrigue in some of the duller parts of the story.<br/><br/>But what the film is really about is the chaotic events that transpired on the night of September 11. As such, this is a hugely action- packed war film, but what's best is that it succeeds in creating genuine tension, fear and excitement on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Although the film does take a little too long to kick off, the first burst of action is exhilarating. Bay's direction and overuse of shaky cam is at times frustrating, but in general, once this film moves into its middle portion all about the battle in Benghazi, and the desperate attempts of these soldiers to stay alive, is hugely exciting.<br/><br/>From then on, we get over an hour of non-stop action that is both entertaining as well as tense. There are moments where the battle dies down, but the film keeps moving through its use of suspense shown by the confusion of soldiers.<br/><br/>The plot largely focuses on the team's desperate attempts to make sense of the situation at hand, and in that, we get the opportunity to really cheer them on as they just go forth and do what they think is right. Disregarding the political situation and their own preoccupations, these soldiers are shown as brave and talented, and their decision to go out and save lives is a great moment in this film.<br/><br/>However, this isn't a total glorification of war and patriotism. It does have the whole 'no man left behind' mentality (and it takes a lot of inspiration from Black Hawk Down itself), but the grit and, particularly in the final act, the violence, do present some interesting and intelligent questions regarding the entire Middle East situation.<br/><br/>Like I said, this film isn't a total masterpiece. The first act is too slow, and the final act lingers too much. At nearly two and a half hours long, this film should really have been cut down a lot, but its middle portion, the action-driven period of the film, is truly excellent. Also, there's not too much of an emotional power in this film. There are moments where it attempts to do what films like The Hurt Locker and American Sniper have done with regards to giving more humanity to the soldiers, but in general, I wasn't on the edge of my seat hoping they wouldn't die. They were great heroes, but they weren't written as great, deep people.<br/><br/>Overall, however, 13 Hours is a very entertaining and exciting film. With a heap of thrilling action and an interesting look at the current situation in the Middle East, I was fully engaged with this film, despite its occasional pacing issues."

"RLTerry1","6","8","34","14 January 2016"," An excellent depiction of what happened on that fearful day, but poorly shown cinematically.
","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is the latest Michael Bay film. Like a true Michael Bay experience, he wows audiences with spectacular battle scenes, stunning visual effects and sound design, and massive explosions; but, with that comes a sloppily handled ensemble cast, underdeveloped pacing and structure. Even though it was at first surprising that a Michael Bay film was getting a January (cinema graveyard) release, after screening it Tuesday night, it is evident why it received this slot versus a summer release. Although we are still learning about and experiencing the ramifications of what happened on that September evening, even though this movie definitely lacked in overall direction, I feel strongly that with what limited information has been released regarding this tragedy, Bay was able to translate the news footage, transcriptions, and government documentation to the screen in terms of capturing the visceral horror and terror that befell the CIA, special operations teams, and the Libyan Ambassador.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is about the tragic events in September 2012 that caused the deaths of an ambassador, CIA personnel, and ex-military special operations stationed in classified compounds in the Libyan capital of Benghazi. Get a glimpse into what it must have felt like to experience one of the most horrific tragedies since September 11, 2001. In this biographical war thriller, go behind radical, militant Islamic enemy lines and follow a band of six soldiers who took the initiative and disobeyed orders in a valiant effort to rescue US CIA and Consulate personnel from certain death.<br/><br/>Given that this is--or at least seems to be--an accurate depiction of the attack on the US Consulate and CIA Annex in Benghazi, one of the most conspicuous absences is any mention of President Obama or then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Obviously this film was not produced to evaluate the actions of the President and Secretary of State, their respective roles in this attach are indirectly an important element to the narrative of the film that should have at least been mentioned. When a filmmaker, especially one of Michael Bay's caliber, takes on the daunting task of translating a real war-time event to the silver screen, it is important to include the notable individuals who contributed to the success or failure. Knowing that the focus of this film was on the six ex-military special forces, it was not necessary to focus on the Presidential cabinet's actions, or lack thereof. Still, it should have been included on some level.<br/><br/>Like with any Michael Bay film, you are going to get amazing cinematography, visual effects, sound editing, and EXPLOSIONS; but, this biographical thriller lacks adequate pacing and plot structure. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the audience will feel any strong emotional connection to any of the characters in the ensemble cast. One thing is for sure, most people watching this movie will definitely hate the enemy. But, a movie like this one needs to go beyond a nearly unified hatred of the radical, militant Islamic terrorists and cause the audience to develop strong feelings and connections with the central characters. Despite having a slight connection to one of the soldiers due to witnessing his interactions with his family back in the States, Bay fails to further develop him or the other characters in terms of growing the relationship between the characters and the audience. Although there are deaths of great significance in this movie, it is likely that none of them will be tearful or pull at one's heartstrings.<br/><br/>I feel that this film had potential to be another American Sniper or Saving Private Ryan but failed to include the emotional connection to the central characters and appropriately pace the film. It really isn't the narrative in and of itself that is lacking--there is certainly a good story there--but the poor pacing and underdeveloped characters combine to occasionally cause the audience to feel lost in the events. Thankfully the film includes timestamps and locations to help the audience follow the course of events that lead up to the attack on the consulate. The sheer realism of the attack is incredibly impressive. There are even some shots that look very similar to the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Bay's Pearl Harbor. Bay was successful at effectively combining the best of practical and visual effects to create an immersive experience for the audience.<br/><br/>Whether you come from the position that the CIA showed rampant incompetence, coupled with a lack of action from the President's cabinet or you feel equally strongly that the CIA and President's cabinet made the best decisions they could with the information they had, this film brings a recent war-time tragedy to life for the silver screen. You will definitely feel like you are in the midst of the action and get a feeling for what it must have been like for the soldiers to go against orders from the CIA to do what they felt was the right thing. For those who appreciate and thoroughly enjoy military or war movies, then this film is definitely for you. Because of the fantastic technical direction of the film, it is one that can be enjoyed by just about anyone. Despite the fact that it definitely has areas in which it greatly lacks, it is definitely visually driven and communicates this attack with realism."

","Billed as being based on a true story, '13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi' is An Intense Film, that works on its hardcore nature & deft direction by Michael Bay. Bay is in form after a long, long time & '13 Hours' is a welcome return of the once inspiring filmmaker. <br/><br/>'13 Hours' follows six members of a security team who fight to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya after waves of terrorist attacks on September 11, 2012. <br/><br/>'13 Hours' begins boringly, but gathers fantastic momentum as it progresses. Once the attacks begin & the heroes fight back, '13 Hours' turns into a gripping ride. I was involved in the narrative, when the violence erupted in tremendous speed. This is an unfortunate story on violence & loss, & Bay delivers it with a beating heart.<br/><br/>Chuck Hogan's Screenplay, based on Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book by the same name, takes time to gain power, but once it does, oh baby! Bay's Direction is well-done. Its good to see Bay focusing on restrained storytelling, rather than VFX Porn. Cinematography captures the gritty mood, with dexterity. Editing is sharp, although the film is a bit too long (144-minutes). Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action/War-Sequences are excellent. Make-Up is nicely done. Background Score merits a special mention.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: John Krasinski is at his most compelling self. He takes charge here & remains the scene-stealer. James Badge Dale is first-rate. Max Martini is efficient. Dominic Fumusa does well. Others lend adequate support.<br/><br/>On the whole, '13 Hours' brings Bay back to form. Watch It!"

","Holy crap. Michael Bay made a truly great movie. That alone ought to tell you something. There is no way you can deny the power of this film. Yes there were a little too many pyrotechnics for my liking, but hey, it's Michael Bay. The story is just so powerful. And raises so many emotions. Of course it is political dynamite. But it does not go there, explicitly. There is no overt statement of blame. But.... that makes it all the more powerful. Those in charge, who were certainly aware of what was happening, simply do not appear in the film. They just aren't there. As they just weren't there on that terrible night.<br/><br/>Very clever. That's not an accident.<br/><br/>The most poignant scene of the film for me, and the most damaging for you-know-who, is a simple still shot, of a squadron of F-16's sitting idle on the runway.

"abouhelier-r","9","3","9","8 April 2016"," 13 Hours
","As an American ambassador is killed during an attack at a U.S. compound in Libya, a security team struggles to make sense out of chaos.<br/><br/>13 Hours is directed by Michael Bay and inspired by the true story of some soldiers who took a stand in Benghazi when they had no idea of what was going on and unclear orders. I really wasn't sure what to expect, especially from Michael Bay. It's his third time trying to reenact a true story, after Pearl Harbor and Pain & Gain. But now having seen the film, I can say that Michael bay has made his most mature movie since... ever. <br/><br/>The first hour is pretty rough as it is the same thing we always saw, setting up characters. It sets them in the most standard ways, so you never really grow to be attached, you respect them but there's no connection whatsoever. John Krasinski is no longer that skinny nerd from The Office, he's in the military now. He does an incredible job in this movie. We should be seeing more of him than we currently are. Him and his team aren't simply badasses, they are badasses from Michael Bay's Alpha Male Signature Series Collection. Their gut instinct is always right and they don't need an Ivy League education to know what's what. It's in this regard that 13 Hours crosses the threshold between just being a Michael bay movie and being a Michael Bay movie that has something to say. <br/><br/>Unlike American Sniper, the film doesn't bring up and doesn't explore, the tension within many men between the lure of danger and excitement, and the longing for intimacy and home. For the very first time though, I think Bay actually found the right balance between fun entertainment for everyone and honoring a true story. Plus, the screenplay limits the audience infos and politic because the infos that the men involved in this situation got back then were also extremely limited. Still, sequences go from firefight to firefight and gradually gains a video game-like structure with a little too much shaky-cam again but nor throughout the whole movie. Directors can do that, but we're coming out of Abrams and Inàrritu so please... Finally, Bay's action is still confused, but he works best in chaos. At one point he even couldn't resist repeating a shot he introduced in Pearl Harbor, that shows a large mortar shell falling slowly and then exploding. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is the living proof that Michael Bay is able to listen to his fans and adapts. He deserves credits for mixing politics and pop filmmaking."
"kevin_newdirections","8","3","9","8 March 2016"," Tension is well-built in spite of the episodic nature of the film
","Hollywood biographical war pictures are used as devices to mark significant events of terrorism, a form through which we comprehend accounts of reality and glimpse on the American psyche. Over the last few years we have Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Lone Survivor (2013), and American Sniper (2014), to name only a few. For 2016, Michael Bay leads the strain of contemporary soldiers flick in 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.<br/><br/>No stranger to true story war films, Bay has directed Pearl Harbor way back 2001. The film opened to mixed reviews on its failed attempt to be the Titanic equivalent of war films. Bay has the history of directing overly-ambitious films run by his love for visual cacophony—extreme dose of chaos, explosions, CGI, lens flare, and other cheap tricks. He is a little kid left in the nursery room, one that gets his jollies all over the place and blows everything into Michael-bay pixels—a phenomenon we fondly call the ""Bay-ism"". I have to swallow my subconscious hate for the man, however, after seeing 13 Hours—an actually good action film. Sure, the heavy use of exploding stuff is still present but in the film's case explosion is recurrent and central to the story.<br/><br/>13 hours takes us to the actual events that transpired on September 11, 2012 when a series of attacks stormed the U.S. embassy and CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. The action focuses on the six-man team of private military contractors: headed by the alpha-leader Rone (played by James Badge Dale), with former jarheads Jack, Oz, Tig, Tanto, and Boon (played by John Krazinski, Max Martini, Dominic Fumusca, Pablo Schreiber, and David Denman, respectively). Being the sole security of the CIA outpost and the thirty CIA desk agents/officers housed inside, together they fight-off and hold Libyan terrorists long enough for a back-up team to arrive—a plan of which they are uncertain. This occurs for a 13 bloody long hours. Easier said than done.<br/><br/>Read full review here: http://goo.gl/cRmuVJ"

","13 Hours is directed by Michael Bay and stars John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman, and Dominic Fumusa. The story follows a terrorist attack enacted upon an American embassy in Libya, called Benghazi. When Ambassador Chris Stevens and his security were under attack, all soldiers were told to stand down. However, a handful of men went to lend aid, despite what their superiors told them.<br/><br/>To get it out of the way, this film barely touches the political issues behind the film's story, and that was a good move. What 13 Hours does is takes the exact truth of what happened in the terrorist attack, and sets it on the audience's lap, leaving them to form their own opinions upon the topic. This aspect of the film adds a layer to it that isn't too politically preachy, as many feared this film would be.<br/><br/>As far as Michael Bay movies go, 13 Hours is amazing. Not that Michael Bay is a terrible director, he just doesn't have the best filmography under his belt. However, he's created a few good films in the past, such as Transformers (just the first one), or the 1998 blockbuster, Armageddon. I don't hate the guy, because I believe that he truly tries to make quality content, he just doesn't always succeed. Despite his issues in the past, he did a really good job with 13 Hours. I enjoyed it, and appreciated almost every aspect of it.<br/><br/>While on the topic of Mr. Bay, his direction was great. The only issue I took with the camera work was very small, and that was just the over abundance of slow motion shots throughout. All of the slow motion was done well, but it was used just a little too much. Other than that, however, I had absolutely no problems with any work that Michael Bay did on the film. The direction was perfectly fine, and it worked very well for what the film was wanting to achieve.<br/><br/>The best thing about 13 Hours is the acting, and all of the talented actors working on the project. In specific, John Krasinski delivers one of his best performances to date, leading the film brilliantly. All other actors do good as well. Although I wouldn't use the word ""outshine,"" I feel that John Krasinski does stand out a bit next to his co-stars, due to his higher level of acting, despite the other actors doing well in their roles.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the worst thing about the film is the suspense, or, rather, the lack thereof. Throughout the entire film, our main protagonists are under near constant attack, yet I barely ever felt any tension in their situation. I never truly got attached to any of the characters, and thus I never feared for their lives. Although the story, and the real men who tragically gave their lives, is very sad, I never felt any tension or fear almost at all, and that pulled the film down a lot.<br/><br/>Like mentioned above, I never truly cared for the film's characters, and I'm basing that critically on the characters in the film, not the real men. This was completely the fault of the script, because of its inability to make me feel for the characters in the film. Although I feel that Chuck Hogan did a good job with the script, he didn't make me, as the viewer, care too much for the characters, which isn't a good thing to say about a writer.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy 13 Hours, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again, I just wouldn't pay much for that chance. I'd recommend 13 Hours to anyone who likes action or war films, or is regularly involved in anything politics."

Though the basic details of what has happen were represented, the core of the film leans more on the soldiers who tried to stop this and rescue the US ambassador. As an action film, it's pretty much you'd expect from the director; nearly endless mayhem. As a drama, it chooses pretty stock choices. It's pretty much how it honors the soldiers who fought and die for their country, while that isn't a really bad theme, it's been overdone especially in Michael Bay standards. Put aside the knowledge who directed this film, it's still not a compelling or even fun clash of unending spectacle.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a long exposition which is basically the most interesting bit of them all since it takes us to politically intrigue. Everything else is basically just these ex-soldiers doing what you'd normally see from a soldier in movies. And in spite that they are more of the focus, the characters are ridiculously interchangeable. They all have muscle, they all fight for their country, they all have a family back home who misses them. And there is some friendship between the two lead characters that the movie wants us to care about. While it does work at times, it's still that typical brotherhood subplot that is done with even less distinction. The movie is pretty much glorifying these soldiers too much that everyone else is being antagonized for being naive and not letting them fight for their country.<br/><br/>The action is impressive to look at, though coherence might be tough for most people. But if you like to see an extreme dose of explosions, shaky cam and lens flare, then you know what you'll get in a Michael Bay film, though to be fair, you can find some worthy tension in the less explosive moments. But we also get the worst of him by putting his crass humor scattered around. And yes, their enemies are faceless as ever. It's kind of strange that the movie has to end with the victims' loved ones mourning for them, while it's good that they are aware that these people have families too, the victorious tone being played in that epilogue makes it seem tasteless. But hey, if the US soldiers win in the end, then that is what it all matters for Bay.<br/><br/>There is so much interesting going on to this story, but 13 Hours chooses to settle with the explosions. While the explosions do look stunning, it pretty much misses the opportunity of covering the stuff that seem more important to tell. And as a Michael Bay film, the result is as predictable as it gets; glamorizing US soldiers, over-indulging spectacles, etc. And it's not shown in a newer spin, either. The patriotism is less compelling and one sided as ever, the action is loud, but if you're into that then the cool explosions may entertain you. If you are looking for a more complex or sophisticated representation here, then 13 Hours won't quite help getting you into that perspective."

Surprisingly better than-anticipated Michael Bay helmed production about the true life event in 2013 where the US Embassy was under attack in Libya while a covert team of security attempts to serve their duty with nothing but roadblocks, red-tape and basically a clusterf*ck of 'intelligence' and 'communications' gone haywire. Krasinski, Dale & Martini stand-out as the stalwart yet troubled men of action hampered by their knob of a boss Costabile (doughy bureaucracy personified) as all hell breaks loose. Bay manages to be somewhat restrained (ok there's a car chase and some 'splosions) yet the screenplay by Chuck Hogan, based on Mitchell Zuckoff's novel account of the battle that follows the playbook of ""Black Hawk Down"" : stick to the facts in spite of the rah-rah jingoistic hokum thrown in for good measure."

"Horst_In_Translation","4","4","15","14 April 2017"," Just the typical Bay unfortunately
","""13 Hours"" or ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is an American Oscar-nominated movie from 2016. The director is Michael Bay, which usually means style (especially special effects) over substance, but the fact that Chuck Hogan is the writer here and I quite enjoyed ""The Town"" gave me some hope. He adapted the book by Mitchell Zuckoff. But my hope was dashed relatively quickly. This is a war movie as generic as they come. I may be slightly biased as I am not only not a great Bay fan, but also military films are certainly far from my favorite genre, but as an Oscar nominee I still thought I'd give it a go, even if it is ""only"" in the sound category. It is set in Libya and plays pretty much in the now, not too long ago really, so an interest in current politics may help. Or it may hurt perhaps too as you will recognize the inaccuracies here. Cast includes not too many big names really, even lead actor Krasinski is not a star when it comes to the big screen.<br/><br/>Anyway, people who really enjoy army-based movies, even if the story is not really that good, may have an okay time with this one here. One of my main criticisms about this film, however, is that it never elaborates convincingly on the characters in a way where it would make sense to go all emotional at the very end, where we care enough about the characters and are touched by their actions and what happens to them. But this is also a criticism that is valid for several Michael Bay movies. It's perfectly fine he tries to come up with something memorable, but the quality and talent is not there and when the film then starts taking itself so seriously, then that is a huge problem that leaves a negative impact on the entire project really. But admittedly, it is not just Bay's fault, but you also have to blame the writers at least for the same amount. Besides, at considerably over 2 hours this movie also drags a lot. For me, it is definitely one of the weakest Oscar nominees from this year that I have seen so far. I give it a thumbs-down and only recommend it to those that I already mentioned previously."

","I don't think I would have ever watched this film if it wasn't for its inclusion in the Oscar nominations, although the recipient's name was removed, for violation of Academy campaign regulations, anyway I hoped this fact-based film would be interesting, directed by Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Transformers). Basically in Libya, 2012, a group of ex-military contractors are providing security at an unofficial CIA base in Benghazi. Gaddafi has lost his power and been killed, the climate aftermath has become volatile, with military weapons becoming freely available. Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher), US Ambassador to Libya, makes a visit to the area, staying near the CIA base in a compound, this compound is attacked on the night of September 11th 2012, by hordes of heavily armed locals. The only forces willing and able to defend it are six CIA contractors: commander Tyrone S. ""Rone"" Woods (James Badge Dale), newest member Jack Silva (John Krasinski), Mark ""Oz"" Geist (Max Martini), John ""Tig"" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa), Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber), and Dave ""Boon"" Benton (David Denman). Also starring Toby Stephens as Glen ""Bub"" Doherty, David Giuntoli as DS Scott Wickland and David Costabile as Bob ""The Chief"". I think this film was one that had a fairly limited release and as a result got swept under carpet, no wonder it is became Bay's lowest-grossing film, the action sequences are good enough to pay attention to keep pace moving, with a lot of explosions and guns firing, but it just seems like any military movie I've seen before, it is an alright action thriller based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing. Worth watching!"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>It is a bit weird to call ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" (2016) action movie when so much in here is based on a very true story - it's not just shoot-em-up - it all, more or less, happened in real life. That said, Michael Bay delivers with ""13 Hours"" a very solid action thriller. Acting was very solid by all involved, especially by John Krasinski, James Badge Dale and David Denman. Cinematography as well as script were very solid and engaging. Sure, this movie isn't as deep as ""The Hurt Locker"" or ""Zero Dark Thirthy"", but it is a very solid film nevertheless - i even kinda enjoyed it a bit more then a very good ""Lone Survivor"".<br/><br/>Overall, Michael Bay delivers a very solid action based on a very true story movie. It is by many moons better then any Transformers"" movie (except the first one), and almost on the same league as ""The Rock"" - but as last one was pure entertainment, ""13 Hours"" delivers more because it was sadly all true."

","I've seen practically every military movie ever made and this is the best of them all! <br/><br/>Most war movies depict battles that take place over weeks, months or years. The amount of ""action"" that occurred during this event all happened over about 13 hours and that is why it is such a great story. It depicts American Heroes at their best who gave their lives to save others, against the orders of their bosses.<br/><br/>You feel as if you're in the compound or up on the roof or in the car chases... you can smell the gunpowder. You can experience the angst of these heroes as they try to figure out what to do and who to trust. It was near impossible to know who the Libyan good guys were from the terrorists and these brave men had to figure it out in an instant and make life and death decisions on the fly. Thank God they made the right ones or the body count would of been much higher.<br/><br/>This movie is ""almost"" a documentary and probably should be classified as an actual documentary for Oscar purposes as well as for best picture.<br/><br/>If the anti-American communist Michael Moore can win an Oscar for his ""fake-umentary"" about the criminal man-made, global warming hoax then this movie is a shoe-in for best documentary of all time!<br/><br/>I'd like to see this be the 2nd part of a trilogy. Part 1 would be the lead up to these events, the set-up showing the incompetence of the State Dept under H.Clinton and demand answers as to why she didn't give Ambassador Stevens the extra security he requested so many times for months beforehand... <br/><br/>Part 3 would be the follow up and future trials yet to come to hold those responsible accountable for hanging our people out to dry. Who gave the stand-down orders? There were more than one as bases all over Europe and ships in the Med were mobilizing to help. I demand a detailed explanation of ""Everything"" and ""everyone"" responsible for this tragedy and the attempted cover-up by Susan Rice who should be water-boarded until she talks. ""Who"" told her to go and lie to the American people? Let's start with that question.<br/><br/>The blood of those 4 Americans is on Hillary Clintons' hands and also on Obama as well who went back to bed because he had a fund raiser for his 2nd term, early the next morning. He is a national disgrace for this alone.<br/><br/>Too bad that this movie left out all of the political implications and didn't touch on the shear incompetence of our leaders in the White House or interview the Admiral of that aircraft carrier who got fired for trying to send fighter aircraft support during the embassy siege.

"rgkarim","8","4","16","16 January 2016"," Action, Emotion, but a few Shaky Elements
","Robbie K here reviewing the latest films to hit the box office. Today's write up is on the new ""true story"" war film 13 Hours that looks to be a tribute to soldier heroism. As always it is my job to analyze, study, and grade the movie to help assist you with your viewing selections. Let's get started. <br/><br/>When you think of war you think of action and sure enough this movie has plenty of riveting moments to rock the auditorium. Although the exciting stuff doesn't happen until about halfway through the film (thanks to a lot of talking and pokes at how stupid our government can be) the scenes themselves have everything you want in a movie. Bullets fly, extras spasm from fake gunshots, and fiery explosions bombard the screen as chaos unfolds. Being this is a Michael Bay film, the explosions are excessive alongside the pyrotechnics, but fortunately not to the point of a Transformers film. One thing I liked was the realistic feel of the battle, using strategy and position instead of movie magic to destroy the bad guys, although they did seem to have infinite ammo. <br/><br/>While the action is the main part of the story, the movie has a lot of character development to help bring some relevance to the violence. The first half of the movie focuses on building up the tension for the climax, giving us some insight into the backstory and personalities of our heroes. It's slow, but Bay kept the suspense throughout the film to keep me interested. In addition they even do an excellent job of illustrating the weaknesses of our military and their inability to make decisions. Those with strong political beliefs are sure to get riled up once or twice in the movie. Our actors as well were believable as soldiers with John Krazinski capturing all the emotion and tension of a military man. James Badge Dale also does a ""bang"" up job portraying the leader of the Special Forces unit, bringing a blend of honor, courage, and ironically rebellion in his steely gaze. Yet the true magic is when these two, and the other four soldiers come together, to create what feels like a unit of brothers is formed. <br/><br/>Of course the true majesty of this movie is the editing. The special effects crew crafted a piece of work here that truly is worthy of an Oscar nomination. While the pyrotechnics were a bit overdone, they felt well placed and appropriate for the scenes at hand. Even more impressive is what the sound/music team has crafted together. While booms, crackling guns, and dying scream my not be the most unique thing to grace the speakers, this film does a great job executing them, making sure to not overpower the dialog and military jargon. For me it was the music that brought the main emotional fervor to this film13 hour. The graceful piano work combined with the camera work nearly brought a tear to my eye at the end, mirroring the emotions of the scenes. As for the camera work well that aspect is unfortunately not as good. On the positive side, Bay captures the war from all angles capturing the full effect of the hell this event was. Seeing men erupt into fountains of blood, or losing limbs is something that isn't easy on the eyes and brings out the true carnage. Yet Bay can't seem to hire a stable camera crew to his films. Once more the team has tried to immerse you into the chaos, but I found this ploy to be annoying, nauseating, and a bit distracting. <br/><br/>Overall 13 hours is a solid military action movie filled to the brim with that pride filled portrayal of America's military. The action is solid and the emotional development adds an extra layer of depth that sometimes lacks in this genre. However, the movie isn't that original and uses the same ploys to glorify military prowess, though this movie does a better job of showing how ugly war is. Editing wise, the movie is solid, though I wished they dropped another half an hour off the runtime. Yet in the grand scheme of things this movie was well done and a nice adventure to start the year off right. <br/><br/>Is it worth a trip to the theaters? I would say yes for the technical aspects of the film. Those who have weak constitutions to blood, death, violence, or realistic military warfare should skip this film. One thing I can report, this movie was very popular to older audience members, some having many choice things to say at the end, which I don't wish to repeat. Also those who have PTSD involved with military may not be able to handle the more emotional parts of this movie, as about five men left the theater in a hastened gait. <br/><br/>My scores overall are:<br/><br/>Action/Drama/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5"
"pantagruella","1","7","35","19 June 2018"," Tougher Than American Sniper

The original weapons were used.<br/><br/>This is a great action film with a likable cast of authentic America heroes. I don't like films where there are American casualties but that is a minor criticism.<br/><br/>I don't like films which show foreigners in a good light so this film suits me. All enemy combatants are shown as cowardly primitives who were just looking to loot pockets.<br/><br/>They could have let the audience know in which country the film was set. Why did the US have an embassy in such a basket case of a nation anyway.<br/><br/>I liked the fact the mercenaries were all decent family men unless their Arab opponents.<br/><br/>In the end all the bad guys were killed easily and America won the day."

","The movie shows the homeowners as the bad people and the Americans who are guests there as the good people, but the truth is the homeowners have every right to defend their land against any foreigner. The best part is that the movie illustrates the terrorists as one group not representatives of a religion, and shows some of the middle eastern life, for example respect of everyone for prayers even during war when Muslims stop fighting, and giving space for Arabs to speak their language as natives. There is a fatal mistake in the first 4 minutes, a scene when the airplane was landing ""one airline"" and after landing behind Jack Silva ""another airline"" which is very evident and anyone should see it. Anyway, the idea sucks, although it illustrates the bravery of men, because it hinders the fact that Americans were fighting against homeowners regardless of their backgrounds."

There was no input from CIA sources so these guys looked like schmucks in the film and book while the mercenaries were the only heroes.<br/><br/>To all of the Hilary Haters out there please just crawl back into the hole where you were born. I just don't understand how people can be so fixated on this event, especially after these same people didn't make so much as a peep during the seven years George Bush led us into the most disastrous foreign policy error in our nation's history. So if you're looking for vindication on your kooky conspiracy theories go elsewhere because this movie doesn't dwell much on the politics. This book and film suffer from the fact that all of the information came from the security detail and nothing from the State Department or CIA thus the narrative is lopsided in favor of the mercenaries who don't speak the language or know anything about the overall situation in Libya.<br/><br/>Ambassador Stevens knew better than anyone the security risks we were taking in Libya at this time and I suppose that his energy, passion for this part of the world, and optimism got the better of him. From everything I have read about him he was a credit to our diplomatic corps and a tireless student of the Arab world. We have precious few of his ilk."

"bmaster4616","8","3","11","23 January 2016"," Bay has finally delivered with a good movie. Proving that people someday grow up, even if it's only for one movie.
","The history of movies is almost as controversial as the events that went down in Benghazi, Libya. From scandals to affairs, Hollywood has been controversial since the beginning of time. The movie presents itself just like Hollywood. The exterior structure looks glamorous with a hollow center of both destruction and chaos, with both a surprising good narrative and less Baism then his past films. Bay seemed to have truly wanted to make a good movie, without the need to trump action over characters. This results in a good tale of the soldiers who gave their lives to fight an enemy that shouldn't exist.<br/><br/>13 hours tells the true story (depends on what you believe) of the accounts leading up to the attack of a military base in the city of Benghazi, Libya. There has been Civil uprising of the government, which leads to the militant capture of the country. They shunned many world powers, especially United States out of the country. After a press meeting with the an United States Ambassador is leaked to the public, the militants track down his outpost. This leads to the death of the Ambassador that then spirals out of control. This leads to military base being next one the list. The military will now have to defend their stronghold against the onslaught of forces who are headed their way.<br/><br/>Bay has mostly created lifeless characters, an action driven story, and laughable romance in almost all of his movies. His track record has been less than even bad, with movies like the Rock being the best. Bay has produced a lot of critics because of this. Though he's been able to turn a profit with almost everything he touches. Though his storytelling is pushed aside for cheap tricks and remarkably terrible dialogue. This phenomenon is called ""Baism"". It's when a director simply makes money, no matter the quality of the film. Though this has led to a decline in sales, because audiences just seem to value the movies again. However, this outing is the best he's ever produce. Bay leaves all the trickery at the door, for some good character development.<br/><br/>The story is as hollow as any bad movie out there. The story train chugs down the straight path and hits all of the same rhythms as every real life war movies before it. Little history lesson with text, small period showing unrest, civilized manor of defusing that unrest, diplomacy fails, climax occurs, and the resolution. This doesn't have anything new or even compelling. It's a predictable ride throughout and no major significance happens in the story.<br/><br/>Though Bay doesn't want the audience to focus on that portion of the movie. His attention is solely committed to giving the audience the real victims, the soldiers. In most of Bay's former movies, action was pushing the story along. It was the action that turned the attention away from the poorly written script and stiff characters. It a Baism tactic to distract the audience to shift focus off the awfulness of the movie. However, 13 hours kicks off the meat of the movie with action, it's the characters who push the story along. The characters create the action through their actions, and it allows the centers the focus onto the characters involved.<br/><br/>Though it seems like another distraction tactic, that turns the focus away from the story. However, the characters feel so genuine and real, that it isn't problem to focus solely on them. That's what the title even says. They are secret soldiers in foreign land, which they don't truly understand themselves. Bay truly captures this aspect by getting the audience to get connected with these characters. His goal is for the tension to rise when these characters are in trouble, not begin able to distinguish the enemy from the friendly's. This wouldn't be possible if Bay just throe action in the faces of the audience. He really achieves tension by simply narrowing the focus onto a couple of people. The connection between the characters and audience is captured by giving us only small backgrounds characters other than the main character. Not bogging down the movie with sappy back stories of every single man. Though giving enough insight to care for those that eventually die.<br/><br/>Overall, Bay does a fine job with creating a movie that's mostly character driven, pulling away from his usual Baisms, to produce a mature movie to honor these men. Though Bay can't help himself at times with some bad dialogue, firework explosions, a weak story, and one or two lifeless characters. However, Bay puts on his directors cap to make a grounded film that tells the story of survival. It gives way to some great scenes of extreme tension. 13 hours might not be up to the 2014 standards of American Sniper, but sets itself up to be its little brother. 8/10"

The film focuses on the soldiers and the people of the unofficial CIA base, ignoring the politics side of the story, placing and maintaining the viewer in the shoes of the soldiers, forcing them to go through an experience that no one would ever imagine going through, just as the soldiers would've been forced to.<br/><br/>While Michael Bay is known for creating explosive movies (pun intended), this film really does show that Bay can direct a fantastic film and also carry his own style with it. It is clear in the second act that this film *is* directed by Bay as we are introduced to the shaky-cam that makes our eyes roll around in our heads; the super saturated night shots with neon lights that make us question his editing techniques; and the infamous explosion festivals. Though, with all these questionable styles, no one can question his battle-cinematography choices. Bay does a fantastic job with bringing the viewer into the film and showing us just exactly what it's like to be in the shoes of these soldiers. We have no contact with the politics side of this situation, just as the soldiers don't. The entire second and third act we as the viewer are just as scared, nervous, and anxious as the soldiers in the film are.<br/><br/>So, while Michael Bay's film techniques may have been questionable and unnecessary in other films of his filmography, they are put to good use in this film and really add to the surreal settings of war."

","I gave it 6 because of Michael Bay.It's long, downright dispiriting, enjoyable only sometimes, and yet there's a feeling of authenticity. It's neither bad nor good, but interesting. It might improve with age.I don't think he is a good director.And i think the scenario could have been better(i know its based on a true story).I think this movie could have been an 8 if the director was someone else.I'm not saying ''dont watch this movie'' or ''it's terrible''.This was just my opinion.Otherwise I was pleased that this was about people and not politics.After a string of bad Transformers movies, Bay reminds that he can do a much better action movie, but not the best."

","Lets face it , it's very easy criticise Micheal Bay and he's movies. He's made some real stinkers in recent years but credit where credits due , even though 13Hours The Secrets Soldiers of Benghazi is by no means perfect it's not terrible either in fact I quite enjoyed it. This is the true story of the attack on a U.S. embassy outpost in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, which killed four Americans (including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens) . The bad out of the way first , its 45 minutes too long and it is a little bit flag waving at times but i was impressed the cast , especially John Krasinski who I would never have seen in this role but it works. James Badge Dale and Pablo Schreiber are good too. The special affects are pretty good as well and thankfully not a transformer in sight!. Not bad at all."
"geekfurious","7","2","6","5 July 2016"," Michael Bay undrapes the American flag from his shoulders to make his best movie yet
","There isn't a ton of depth here, since it is essentially about a single day-in-the-life (and death) of a group of people serving their country. What is most impressive is what Michael Bay does and doesn't do with it.<br/><br/>Unlike most of his other movies involving the military, this time Bay leaves the eye-rolling patriotism out and just tells a story with some of his most understated visuals, granted, there is still overuse of shining light into the camera, making a few scenes, that should have felt genuinely dramatic, too stylized.<br/><br/>It's not without other problems, like the moments when Bay just HAS TO add Hollywood explosions where realistic ones would have made the movie feel even more powerful, but it's surprisingly without preachy political BS.<br/><br/>I think what hurts this movie is that it is called ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" because while I'm sure the word ""Benghazi"" definitely draws in the usual crowd to the movie, it also likely drives some away.<br/><br/>To sum up: <br/><br/>A solid movie about terrible things happening to people serving in a dangerous place. It is not a political movie demonstrating evidence that your least favorite side purposely tried to destroy the country you and they claim to love. And if less sentimental in spots, could have even been an 8 out of 10."

","Well I did not rate this too high based on the acting, cinematography, and how the director unraveled the story.<br/><br/>It is a 10 out of 10 for informing me on what happened at Bengazi. I did not know all of this. <br/><br/>I have read a lot about how the state department did or did not do things correctly, but watching this it is squarely a failure of the military to support these folks. It occurred over a really long period of time and help was hours away. They should have gotten help. <br/><br/>I understand that the State Department/Congress did not fund the embassies around the world enough. However, the CIA local directors self preservation and the failure of the military in that part of the world to support them also shocked me. <br/><br/>The most shocking to me is the ambassador was delivered alive by Libyans to a Libyan hospital. What the hell!<br/><br/>If they ever find out that the state department ordered there to be no support or something, I would support the anger toward them but I don't think that is what happened.<br/><br/>The film shows that for whatever reason, confusion, misinformation, etc, the folks in Bengazi did not get the rapid, real, support they could have gotten. It is painful to watch. The state department was not in charge of a tactical circumstance like this. The military is in charge, period, unless somehow limited. <br/><br/>The detail about the accurate mortars, the preplanning and all is interesting, very much so, but really not part of any unraveling conspiracy in my opinion. They wanted to kill us Americans there. That is it. I am glad there was some support from the locals as it did hurt us, but also helped it appeared. Fighting a war where your allies are your enemies at times is the craziest part! <br/><br/>I have been to many, many US hellholes around the world in the Navy and I feel very lucky that during my military service I was not laid out without support like these folks. We in the US are so insulated from the real world where folks will kill you for your citizenship, a price on your head, well for many things that wouldn't seem worth it. I still cannot bear to watch our culture move toward ""Idiocracy"" when I see 3rd world cultures whose basic culture and mode of operation are that of how it was in the US 30-50 years ago. I guess I am just getting old. I am always glad to come home now from work travel abroad and that has not changed anytime in my life. I am a proud American. I see the immanent decline coming, though. If you want to know what will happen here, look at culture in Western Europe as our decline will mimic theirs though lag by years at a time."

Pure luck they had some guns, because they would have problems with delivery at night.<br/><br/>Either the movie is a big lie, or those guys in real life came to battle unprepared, I don't judge whose fault was it, but the end effect is this -- ""13 hours"" is a painful experience for anyone who knows how to pack his/her backpack."

About being abandoned, the men who died trying to protect people who should have been supported by their country.I wonder what has been put in place for the future people working OS in a hostile region. In the end did the death of the CIA staff and security make a difference for future compounds. It is a movie that will sit with me for many years."
"maverick-84924","8","1","2","23 December 2017"," Michael Bay makes an good apolitical movie (surprisingly).
","The story behind this movie is fairly well known. The blame laid upon Clinton & Obama routinely spouted by the alt-right as evidence of their heinous natures. Funnily enough, they don't mention the attacks & deaths of US citizens during Bush Jr's term in office. (13 separate incidents and 60 US citizens killed). Where's the hand ringing and finger pointing regarding that? Even the GOP witchhunt found then Secretary of State Clinton blameless for the incident.<br/><br/>With that background, I began watching the movie fairly sceptically (especially given it's Bay heritage). I'm happy to say, however, that it wasn't the political aggrandising we've come to expect from the right side of Hollywood. Eastwood and the dross that was American Sniper could learn quite a bit by actually giving facts without the hyper-patriotic BS we've come to expect from a sector of Hollywood.<br/><br/>The movie is, instead, a gripping tale of the fate of the PMCs and State Department / CIA operatives during the ordeal in Benghazi. There's even a bit of pro-Libyan blurb towards the end, mentioning that the average Libyan was appalled by the carnage.<br/><br/>Some Bayism's occur, obviously, with slo-mo deaths, gore and lots of flashy explosions, but this doesn't detract from the meat of the story. Those who complain about these should really get a life and take it for what it is.<br/><br/>Equally so, the macho, bearded 'operators' are actually the sort of men one would expect to see in a high-level PMC. The amateurs at the Embassy compound contrast rather well and are more prevalent in the cowboy outfits like Blackwater and the like. This isn't Bay giving some sort of homo-erotic homage to these men, it's just a reality of the situation. They take extraordinary risks in extremely hostile environments and are very 'Alpha Male' personalities. Once again, deal with it.<br/><br/>In closing, it's a lot better than American Sniper and although 'gung ho' is a good ride from beginning to end."
"stebird","10","1","2","12 November 2017"," A secret that could've been catastrophic!
","Utterly compelling and outrageously disturbing, ""13 Hours"" most certainly isn't for the weak of heart, pulling no punches it's a realistic retelling of what really happened that day in Benghazi; director Michael Bay who has earned an unwanted reputation in the world of cinema hits back big style and I believe his newest film tells more truth than it does lies.<br/><br/>Nobody truly knows what really happened in Benghazi, other than those that were there to live it and the government, and you'll never get the truth from the government. <br/><br/>I'd like to say the wizards of Hollywood production did a remarkable job flowering the film up to look as intense and gritty as possible, but realistically they probably didn't need to, as the real life version was more than likely even more intense and nasty, so if anything they must have toned it down to make it more suitable for the big screen. <br/><br/>Herein lies a vastly underrated film that should've been acclaimed a Hell of a lot more than it has been, and it gives a glimpse into what life is really like in post-Gaddafi Libya..., how unsettled and dangerous the place is, that the populous seems confused more so than ambitious and nobody knows what the future holds for the country, just a part of the much larger Arab-Spring.<br/><br/>A cast of largely unknown actors, but rightfully so, in a film such as this having actors you don't recognise adds to the tension and the realism, whereas having a cast of A-listers would greatly mar the experience somewhat, because if you recognise the actor, you know you're watching a film, if you watch someone you don't recognise, you could in fact be watching a very real documentary, or even better, you could be living the experience in real time through their eyes. <br/><br/>Let's just all be thankful that there were six secret soldiers based not far away that were able to come in for the rescue, because who knows what could've happened if these men weren't in fact there."

John Krasinski played his role very superbly I haven't seen him like this kind of role in any other his movies he surely dedicated himself for this role and gives extra credit for this movie. The total duration of this movie is two hours and extra minutes, the danger started before the character (jack Silva) enters Benghazi for his work over there. Locals monitored and surveillance the station for more than weeks by planning how to demolish it completely with US citizens on it. To prevent it from happening how the security team guarded their people and not thinking about their own safety and fight for them till the end with the complete patriotism and courage is what inspires me a lot about this movie."
"Hellmant","8","3","12","15 January 2016"," A decently entertaining action flick (as all Michael Bay films are).
","'13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A war film, depicting true events (at least somewhat); of the 2012 terrorist attacks, on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi. The story focuses on the six (brave) American security contractors, who defended the compound; and then came under attack, themselves. The movie was directed by Michael Bay, and written by Chuck Hogan; it was based on the 2014 book, '13 Hours', by Mitchell Zuckoff. It's a bit too long, slow-paced at times, and not very dramatically involving (compared to what it should be); but it's still a decently entertaining action flick (as all Michael Bay films are).<br/><br/>When an American ambassador (Matt Letscher), was visiting a U.S. compound, in 2012 Libya, an army of Islamic militants attacked him. A six-man security team, stationed in the area (made up of military veterans), tried to come to his defense; and then they were attacked themselves. The film stars James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, David Denman, Max Martini, Dominic Fumusa and Pablo Schreiber; as the team. It also costars David Costabile; as their arrogant commander Bob (also called 'The Chief'). Chaos, and very violent bloodshed, ensued. <br/><br/>I don't have any idea how accurate, or true (to actual events) this movie is; or if it has a political agenda (or not). I can review it (simply) on it's own merits, as a movie though. I think it's a pretty entertaining action flick; but at 2 hours and 24 minutes, it's a bit too long. It's also really slow-paced, at times (despite all of it's bloody action), and sometimes it's pretty hard to follow. That might have been Bay's intent though, to better relay what the soldiers were going through (complete chaos). In some ways, Bay is perfect for this type of movie; and in other ways, he's not. He's definitely good at the action scenes, even though they're so chaotic. The film kind of reminds me of a 'TRANSFORMERS' flick (at times); in how hard it is to tell what's going on. Bay is also not that good at emotional depth, or character development; but he does deliver some good drama (especially at the end). Krasinski and Dale are both great action hero leads. It is odd to see Krasinski teamed with Denman, again though (in a serious action movie). Both actors were on 'THE OFFICE' (as Jim and Roy); I kind of wanted to watch them fight again, over Pam. The film is also not nearly as good as 'AMERICAN SNIPER' or 'LONE SURVIVOR'. Both of those movies were also released on the 'Martin Luther Day' holiday weekend (in 2014 and 2013). Hollywood definitely knows how to follow a successful business pattern!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/3D-Xa6uhK5U"

"SpoilerAlertReviews","9","2","7","30 December 2016"," An intense and harrowing true story of unknown heroics.
","Hands up if you're a Michael Bay hater? Yes, he ruin Transformers for a lot of people and has a tendency to add unnecessary, stereotypical elements like objectifying women. But, none of you can say he hasn't brought sometime to the realm of Cinema, that high gloss colour that seems to be filmed through an Instagram filter and his trademark 360 degree rotation levitation shot. I love those shots. Who didn't like Armageddon? Even for its flaws, it's still a strong guilty pleasure. Bad Boys? Pain and Gain? And now 13 Hours. <br/><br/>Bay does a damn good dramatisation of Mitchell Zuckoff's (really?) titular book, a true story about a highly trained private security team, code-named the Global Response Staff, or the G.R.S. a fancy title for mercenary contractors, who are protecting the last CIA outpost in Benghazi, Libya during the civil war after the deposition and execution of Gaddafi. <br/><br/>Tensions constantly run high with everyone in town being a potential threat and situations go from bad to war zone crazy when members of the Ansar al-Sharia militant group attacks the U.S. safe house acting as home to Ambassador J. Christoper Stevens, killing him and operative Sean Smith. A part of the team disobeys authority and attempts to rescue the U.S. civilians while the others initiate lockdown protocols building defences and preparing for the bloody carnage coming their way, but there's internal conflict from CIA chief adding to the suspense. Do they stay or evacuate, do they live or die. <br/><br/>I still cant believe it's John Krasinski, Jim from the American Office and star of Away We Go. An entirely different role, I'm not sure what I would have thought knowing it was him before watching. In fact, the film doesn't have any A-listing stars which I found refreshing and all the cast gave absolutely strong, convincing and often gut-wrenching performances. There's good character development with a lot of screen time with family calls and fun camaraderie between the tightly trained team. <br/><br/>After much debate with Director of photography, Oscar winning cinematographer, Dion Beebe, Bay decided to shoot entirely in digital for the first time due to the night scenes and scheduling rulings. I'm not a fan of digital, possibly for the same reasons as most directors, Bay included; digital still can't capture fast action turning them into a blur and ironically, dark scenes appear blotchy. Though, it doesn't ruin the film, and some of the action is incredible, being so real, it adds to the great scene of danger. <br/><br/>Bay always enlists ex-military as technical advisors on his films and it's evident that it pays off receiving high praise from military personnel, but it surprisingly bombed at the box office resulting in being Bay's lowest grossing film of all time but could that be because of the lack of big names attached to the cast? <br/><br/>The concluding fighting lasts around 90 minutes which is only a snippet of the thirteen hours the team had to survive whilst protecting the civilians. The original cut was actually 4 hours long and you can understand why, but gladly it is cut shorter, not that it drags, but it's already long with a running time of 144mins. <br/><br/>The firefights are intense, loud and totally destructive, the sound of gun and mortar fire is deafeningly good. The stunt-work and pyrotechnics are insanely precise, Bay lighting the scenes up with explosions after firebombs and non-stop machine gun fire. <br/><br/>Lorna Balfe does an superb score, mostly sombre with some heavy hitting tracks, the soundtrack tells the story perfectly. I have listened to the track ""Forgotten"" over and over when I first watched this and the rest of the score is just as good. <br/><br/>This is a story about heroics, where people not actually bound by duty but by what is the right, those who act in times of crisis regardless of self, risk and money, a definition of honour and the courageous men who lost their lives that day. It's emotional, powerful and engaging amidst total carnage. It raises a lot of questions, politically, with plenty of red tape endangering peoples lives. <br/><br/>This film would sit comfortably next to Black Hawk Down and Lone Survivor; and fans of both should enjoy this modern warfare film, but it doesn't glorify war, only the soldiers that bravery protected the compound for a gruesome 13 hours against all odds. It's a big spotlight on the casualties, fatalities and the harsh realities of war. <br/><br/>Whether you're a Bay fan or not, this is certainly one of the best war films of 2016 if not of the decade and has been overlooked. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 9 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for excellent performances, a harrowing depiction of an unknown war story. <br/><br/>91% 9/10"

"heisenberg12","7","2","7","27 June 2016"," Sometimes you just have to let an action film be an action film
","I read critic reviews on metacritic, and as expected many were very harsh in assessing 13 Hours. It's easy to see that these critics don't want an action movie to be what it is: an action movie. That's not a fair assessment. That's like watching a comedy like Dumb and Dumber and arguing it wasn't Shakespearean enough. You have to let it be what it is. Comedies, action films, etc...These aren't art or poetry films, but nor are they trying to be. They are what they are, and if you don't know what you are getting going into watching them (or you don't accept them for what they are), then the criticism is on you.<br/><br/>Now, I knew what I was getting right when I popped the DVD in. I was getting an action movie from Michael Bay. Fortunately, this was not Transformers with robots flying in the air and talking, but was at least based on a true story. Refreshing.<br/><br/>Yes, you have your ""Bayisms"" all throughout, but to argue these things at this point from a critic standpoint is so cliché, you score no points dissecting them. Just let them be, as long as they are bare minimal and covered in smoke and gunfire enough that they are at a new low for his films. And that they were. No points lost in this for Bayisms. In fact, I kind of liked them here.<br/><br/>So as far as action movie films go, this film is a slam dunk. It nails everything you would want and hope for. To say the action scenes were suspenseful and intense would be an understatement. You are glued to the screen in a trance during the majority of the movie and its gunfights. You can't even blink.<br/><br/>What I found fascinating and totally relieved in was that some people actually did live. I had sketchy details of the events, but I swore I heard that everyone died, and I was really depressed to think that was the case much of the time. But thankfully, there are many who do survive, and that was not only uplifting but also a surprise. It wasn't a full blown ambush with no hope of survival at all.<br/><br/>This is one of Bay's better movies. It's got heart, is based on a heroic true story, has some good actors, has some funny scenes, entertains, and has a nice ending. For me, it gets a high score because it is riveting and gripping and delivers everything you can expect and ask for from an action film, and a little bit more.<br/><br/>8/10"

Michael Bay has made a tremendous job in getting a sense of reality and entertainment at the same time. <br/><br/>Moment to moment, the characters is getting alive and creating relationships throughout their own special way that forms them into who they are. Michael Bay is balancing that is such a great way for it to really grab hold of the viewer. One special scene is where the soldiers is waiting for the next attack, if there will be one, and having little both emotionally and lightheaded conversation about the topics of war and daily life. About 1:41:00 into the movie there is another conversation about that the interpreter want to stay when recommended to leave. Amahl (Peyman Moaadi) goes down to the war room and ""Tanto"" (Pablo Schreiber) turns to his partner in war, ""Boon"" (David Denman), and breaks the silence with: ""I'm gonna have to break up with him before we leave Libya...."" ""Boon"" starts laughing with a good and tired heart in the background, very clear and sound. This is an example of the entire movies solid authentic feeling. In most of the movies nowadays there would have been silence after ""Tanto""'s line, and for the audience to catch up with the humour and laugh. In reality, it would probably be in the way Michael Bays lets it go through here. By letting ""Boon"" laugh, it takes the reality into the story and keeps the authentic touch. Extremely well written and directed both acting and dialogue. The soldiers different lives besides their war both within and in Libya is properly taking care of and showed respect for. Actors, script and directors drives the full length of the movie in the same way and gives the finished product what it needs.<br/><br/>The synthezisers rehances the balmy breeze that sweeps around in immediate surroundings... that is creation in a high level... really high level. Just enough so I can hear the extra rehancing of the surroundings and the sound carpets. Classic Michael Bay. People sit and communicate, and a gentle, deep and saturated sound carpet is the basis while the hair and other loose objects sweeps around by both the daily and the nightly wind. Excellent! There is a couple of scenes where the troopers is gathered and exclaims their feelings and emotions of the situations. One of them is (just as in ""Bad Boys"" where Will Smith And Martin Lawrence turns around slowly and the camera is going around them, as they are tired and grabbed by the moment) where the soldiers stand by an airplane and the total scenery and sound effects blend together with the camera giving the full screen of tired and broken down soldiers, hot breezes and an air plane getting to the runway field. Furthermore, the entire production group creates such an authentic feeling climate and environments in Libya that I'm effectively aware in film. That is quality... good quality. Then I come to the comparison between Michael Bay and Michael Mann. I had check who did what to define and distinguish them them. I prefer Michael Mann; his excellent magic in creating a melancholic hopeful feeling by image, ambient environments, sound and the music is phenomenal! And... then that was said.<br/><br/>Last out... a little thing that is conveyed both with class and just the right amount of attention to give the viewer some extra involvement and entertainment: Everybody's name in movies is Jack. Jack Bauer in ""24 Hours"". Jack in ""Titanic"". Jack Ryan in ""Jack Ryan : Shadow Recruit"". Jack Twist in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Jack in ""Speed"". Jack Torrance in ""The Shining""......you get the point. In here... they even go so far that the character being a guard and undercover is named Jack, and the character in the movie is also Jack. Did I hear ""Do you know anything.....do you know jack....?!""<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Look above in the review; astonishing work! The war scenes, the perfect match of sound and exploding weapons and weaponry, the blood, the realistic scenes of soldiers getting hit, the grading of light and so on... everything is well taken care of. Chuck Hogan has drawn his experience and expertise to this one. - The actors : For me, kind of external names in the list of the cast. And, wow... did they deliver! Some little acting abilities here and there that raises my skeptical sense. Other than that...: great! John Krasinski lays it all out there; a true piece of art! - The story : A true story. And that is that. - Entertainment : Both the story, the characters, the music, the sounds, the....well.... almost everything has its own entertaining in here. - Age : 15... or 18, due to gruesome scenes and language.<br/><br/>7,8 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)"

"CinemaClown","Null","3","13","2 July 2016"," Another Addition In The Long List of Self-Indulgent American Propaganda Films
","Made specifically for the American audience & mostly appealing to those who need their daily dose of ""hooah"", 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (simply known as 13 Hours) suffers from the same set of issues that plague majority of Hollywood war flicks and while it is absolutely loathsome as far as its banal script goes, its thrilling action segments do lift it up by a few notches.<br/><br/>13 Hours is a re-enactment of the incident that took place on the evening of September 11, 2012 in Benghazi, Libya when two American compounds came under attack from Islamic militants. The plot follows six members of the security personnel, assigned to protect the covert CIA base, and covers their night-long attempt to prevent the terrorists from storming into the compound while hoping for some help to arrive.<br/><br/>Directed by Michael Bay, 13 Hours isn't as facepalm-inducing as his best-known flicks and actually becomes quite gripping once all hell breaks loose but the script is detestable. And this time, it isn't the clichéd plot or wooden characters that are its main cause of concern but the right-wing stance it takes to depict the whole event, thus further fuelling the nonsensical opinion a certain section of society has regarding the Middle-East.<br/><br/>Filled with dialogues like, ""you can't tell the good guys from the bad"" or ""they are all bad guys until they are not"", the film echoes the ""all Muslims are terrorists"" mindset that idiots easily buy into and in that regard, it isn't just worrisome but dangerous as well. However, even if one sidelines its political agenda, the film remains mediocre in content as there isn't one distinguishable character in the story plus its dramatic portions are no match to its combat sequences. <br/><br/>On a technical scale, 13 Hours scores pretty well. The action-laden moments are choreographed to near-perfection and presents the field of battle in its raw & chaotic form, with bullets & RPGs flying in all directions. The hand-held camera-work brilliantly reflects the disorderly carnage of warfare and its colour hues & chosen camera angles further intensify the experience. Editing isn't entirely up to the mark, performances are average at best, and the background score is simply forgettable.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is at its most riveting when shells & cartridges take the centerstage from its uninspiring drama and it really delivers in that department with plenty of violence, gore & mayhem. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing commendable about Michael Bay's latest. Drenched in jingoistic glory, painting a detrimental image of Libya, and filled with characters no one gives a damn about, 13 Hours is another middling entry in the long list of typical self-indulgent American propaganda films."

","Whether or not I was told prior this was a Michael Bay movie, it would've been pounded into my head 52,000 times that Bay directed this. It's almost he couldn't hesitate to put his mark every few seconds, I guess, to prove he can direct something outside of giant fighting robots.<br/><br/>Yes, I am aware he directed and I saw Pain & Gain, which wasn't all that good, and Bad Boys, etc. But, like James Cameron, he's been pretty much obsessed with one series for almost the past decade.<br/><br/>I'm bringing up Bay a ton because to me, he was a distraction. His ""slight humor"" at the most inopportune times, use of slow-mo, low angles, American Flags everywhere and that American soldiers can never do any wrong/always the hero, were all so spotlighted, I kept losing focus on what could've been a great movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself is straight-forward, and this is coming from someone who knew NOTHING about the Benghazi incident prior to seeing this other than soon-to-be President Hillary Clinton's name is brought up a ton. Contractors/military men are not supposed to be in the worst region of the world, but they're hired by our government to protect an Ambassador and other spies. When memos, orders and fear sets in as the rebels attack, it's up to the contractors/military men to defend their ""base"" and men until help arrives.<br/><br/>When you take out the Bay'isms and the humor that worked sometimes, but mostly inappropriately timed, you can really get into what these men had to go through. I almost don't want to downgrade the movie because it was really intense for many of the scenes and I, of course, was really rooting for them to survive until the cavalry arrived. <br/><br/>But, sadly, since Bay has such an ego, I can't recommend this movie.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I'm guessing there is a lot of politics involved in this incident. Politicians lied to cover-up stuff. Uh-oh. Politicians lying? What the Hell? When did that start happening? <br/><br/>Look, listen. I don't think the general public needs to know all about military operations or the enemies will know more. Duh. Lie. Lie some more. Keep these incidents between the parties that need to know.

Which is what probably ruins the film is the shaky cam, and the pacing which drags on in the second act of the film. Overall, 13 Hours is nothing in comparison with American Sniper but instead is just a poorly shot film with a decent cast, and alright script. While 13 Hours isn't a horrible movie it's not exactly a good one either."
"trublu215","8","3","13","18 January 2016"," A hard, rough-around-the-edges war film that is straight forward and to the point.
","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi stands as Michael Bay's best film since The Rock and proves that Bay, despite lately delving into this, is maturing as a filmmaker. Many people are torn on the Transformers franchise. If you ask a 12 year old boy, Transformers is the best series ever but if you ask someone over the age of 18, they would probably rather see something a little more indulgent. 13 Hours is for the adult moviegoer. It is violent, rough, bloody and very adult in its approach to a still restless political situation even three years later. Bay has no interest in going out of his way to tarnish anyone's reputation here...the events speak for themselves. The story follows a group of contracted government employees who engaged in a firefight between Libyan militia for 13 hours trying to defend a secret US station in Benghazi. We are all well aware of Hilary Clinton and her hand in this situation, Bay knows that so he doesn't even waste actor's breaths on the situation. He decides to let the action speak for itself, literally and figuratively. The film is beautifully captured, it features signature Michael Bay shots, music video esque color grading, which do become repetitive after awhile, but are done in a tasteful manner. Coming from a script penned by Chuck Hogan (The Town; Argo), it is so drenched with the American hoorah type of soldier characters that those Bay-esque angles compliment the film and the telling of it quite well. These were men that didn't really get enough credit for their heroics so anything Bay can do to immortalize them, he is hell bent on doing. The acting is that of your average Michael Bay film, screaming, gunfire, big buff guys working out, it is all the same without the objectifying of women. This film Bay trades his objective vision of women to men, which is a bit comforting to know that he isn't all that sexist after all. Starring John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, and Toby Stephens, the cast does its best between gunfights to establish some character development that doesn't go much further than establishing these men as family men and as soldiers. There's barely character development to grasp here thanks to an ill advised first act that tries to give the audience background on what led to the attack on the embassy in Libya. However, despite the tension filled yet useless first act, the second and third act are blistering with brutal and bloody shootouts, excellent camera work and explosions that put you in the middle of the action. This is a different Michael Bay shoot 'em up, this is one that makes you feel inside the action rather than a spectator of it. Overall, if you can put politics aside, I recommend this film. Yes, this is catering more towards the right than the left but that doesn't make it any less of a good film. 13 Hours stands as Michael Bays finest work in a very VERY long time. Hopefully he can continue this trend of smaller more adult films."
"csliger931","1","2","8","10 May 2020"," Michael Bay is just awful
","I've never been in the military. I don't know the facts about Benghazi. My review is simply from a movie critic standpoint (I'm no critic, just a fan of film). This movie was atrocious. The dialogue was childish and pandering. The special effects were typical Michael Bay...explosions and action that still didn't feel like action. The acting was poor and unbelievable. I just don't understand why this movie is getting such high ratings, but I imagine it's from people who sympathize with the para-military operators whose lives were lost. And there's nothing wrong with that...I sympathize too. My beef has nothing to do with the story itself, but it has everything to do with the filmmaking. If you're 12 yrs old or younger, you may like this movie. Anything older and you're going to want to avoid it."

","Okay, what I liked about this movie, was that it was so chaotic, you basically have no idea what is going on, which is probably what it felt like over there. And Krasinski obviously. He's the sole reason I decided to watch this.<br/><br/>What is annoying about this film is all the talk about american lives, american lives this, american lives that, is it that if lives are not american, they just aren't worth as much? I mean, americans killed two Serbian hostages, during bombing campaign in Libya, if you google that event, you only get pictures of this american ambassador, so clearly his life means more than two Serbian lives taken by americans. It's just sickening how self obsessed americans are.<br/><br/>As for any youth that is considering joining american military and going to some foreign country to kill it's citizens, if you think events from this film were a fluke, and that america actually cares for you, don't kid yourself. They will let you die there, or if you survive they won't provide any medical help to you, just so that they could make a film about your heroic death and your american life. just don't go, stay home, live of welfare, it's way better option.

","Jack Silva (John Krasinski) leaves his young family to join his friend Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) to work as security contractors for the CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya. Both are veterans of clandestine security and former SEAL instructors. It's the wild west awashed in weapons. CIA station chief Bob is dismissive and derisive of their security concerns. Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives to work out of a lightly defended compound. On Sept 11, 2012, tension is high. When the compound is attacked, Stevens and his men retreat to a safe room. Tyrone and his men go on a rescue mission despite Bob's ""Stand Down"" order.<br/><br/>I was concerned that this would be politically skewed one way or another. Either way would be bad. This movie mostly leaves that to the professionals. The initial American villain is the CIA station chief. This is more about these contractors and the confusion of the battlefield. The movie builds a wonderful world of threats. There is a reality to the paranoia and the first part is done very well. Most of the movie is actually after the compound takeover. Some of it blends into each other. It's hard to distinguish the players. There are loads of things getting blown up. I can accept the confusion because the actual situation was probably just as confusing. What this movie shows is the impossibility of distinguishing the good guys from the bad guys. It is the fog of war and mission impossible."

","The' most revealing event about this film is the fact that Secretary Clinton was the person responsible for allowing this tragedy to happen.<br/><br/>The events played out here under the scrutiny of Mr Bay is masterful and has to stand as a lighthouse in cinematic direction. The whole is skilfully edited with plot events that meet most criteria for embedding a true narrative into an appalling catastrophe fit for the screen. The irony is that the CIA Station chief received a medal for being completely devoid of any leadership or vision.<br/><br/>Apart from being a war film shot as close as you can to actually being there, this is a political work clearly showing the actions and consequences created by a government machine totally incompetent to being in charge, and an event where responsibility for murder has never been faced.<br/><br/>In this film there are no big stars and thank goodness for that. It is certainly not gung-ho, looking for John Wayne. The only gung - ho character is Hilary Clinton (sadly not mentioned in the film), and those so called expert film critics who have slated this should go back to media studies, because that is clearly where they come from."

","What to expect from a Michael Bay movie about a highly publicized and politicized violent event? I don't think that question even needs an answer.<br/><br/>The result is surprising though.<br/><br/>Throughout, it doesn't attempt to glorify violence and American power, except for the very end (which is why it doesn't get a higher score from me).<br/><br/>To me this story, while not perfect, is much more digestible than for example American Sniper. Why? First of all it stays pretty close to actual events and there's a real sense of realism in the danger and mortality of war.<br/><br/>Secondly it has believable characters and interesting personal conflicts. Of course it helps that these were taken from the actual history, but it's a point that most films of this genre take very lightly (""People just want to see people killed, bullets fired and fiery explosions"").<br/><br/>Thirdly it doesn't portray the non-Americans as a homogeneous, evil group. Sure, we didn't get too deep into the dynamics of the Second Libyan Civil War, but when portrayals of the locals are usually infantile caricatures it has to be commended that this movie at least takes a step above that.<br/><br/>Now, I wouldn't call it a game changer, because besides the realism, it doesn't bring much new. But if you are interested in the event and/or Libya it's a good, sober look at the factual events. Just don't expect any intellectual or cinematographic revelation."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.7/5 stars<br/><br/>""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is Director Micahel Bay's most mature effort hitherto, and almost makes you forget his cinematic abominations in the past few years; almost, ranking with his best efforts like ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon"". Film schools will hardly declare it as a shining example of brilliant filmmaking, but all the tough SOBs in the Navy Seals, Delta Forces, and Marines - the ones whose opinions actually matter here because they're the ones who go through such harrowing experiences to keep us protected - will, in all probability, give ""13 Hours"" two thumbs up.<br/><br/>The story of the by now well-known attack on the CIA base in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 generally sticks to what is thought to have happened, and provides some tense action scenes while paying due reverence to the sensitivity of its subject matter. But, then again, Bay's expertise in staging elaborate and exciting fight scenarios was never in doubt, it's been his handling of other directorial aspects that have made many of his efforts almost intolerable. Thankfully, this time we get the Bay of ""The Rock"" rather than the man behind the misfires that were ""The Transformers"" movies and his other mind-numbing crapfests.<br/><br/>""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers"" of Benghazi is a gut-wrenching, tense, action-packed, yet emotionally draining war movie, and Bay can still direct if he sets his mind to it. Why doesn't he do it more often?"
"holmantaylor","7","2","8","24 April 2016"," 13 Hours: The Secret Hours of Benghazzi
","Michael Bay creates a real life, real feeling, and real emotional depiction of the night of September 11, 2012. <br/><br/>This film creates a lot of real world emotion and real world appreciation. Obviously, none of us knows exactly what happened the night of the attacks on Benghazi, but we do know the results of what happened that night. Michael Bay did a great job of creating emotion and connectivity between the audience and the characters. <br/><br/>Although the movie viewers may not have known many of the details of what was going on, it seemed as if you always knew what direction it was going. Although the movie was two and a half hours long, I didn't feel it was excessive in any way. It kept me engaged, but more importantly it allowed me to develop a strong relationship with the characters and truly care for them. These relationships becomes a more critical part of the film as it progresses toward the actual attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi. Without it, this would become just another war movie. <br/><br/>I feel that Bay put a lot of effort on this emotional aspect of the movie, knowing that it is based upon a true event. It was one of the most important to me, personally. With the reputation of Michael Bay, the action and explosions in this movie were nothing short of spectacular and didn't cease to fulfill expectations. <br/><br/>The movie portrayed the same anxiety you would feel if you were walking through the streets of Benghazi yourself. The action mixed with the emotional connection you have with the characters of the film allows you to feel appreciation for the experiences that the Navy Seals went through. Although the speed and development of this movie could be considered slow, it leads to a pretty long, dramatic and intense climax. <br/><br/>I would consider the climax of the movie from the moment that the attack begins on the Consulate all the way until the end of the movie. There are bits and pieces of adrenaline rushes in the beginning as they go about their business, but none of them compare to the real life action of the attack and defense.<br/><br/>I cannot accurately critique this movie without mentioning the amazing job that Michael Bay did in going about filming the most controversial military political topic in recent years. It could have been very easy for him, the actors, producers, etc. to put their own personal political views into the screen write. All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is curious about the real events happening in the world that we live in today. It is informative and I feel very accurate. I will never forget the silence in the full theater as the credits began to roll at the end of the movie. You could legitimately feel the respect and admiration everyone had for these men and all that they sacrificed. <br/><br/>The lessons that can be learned from this film are incredible. Forgetting yourself, forgetting who you are because there is something more important than you as an individual. The Seals didn't do these things so that they could receive medals, they did it for the sole reason that they could see their families again, which is the most important thing in this life."

","I believe that this film was based on true events because every event look and felt genuine, it is a good two hours ride, about how bad is war on the people that take part in them. There are many films about this topic, produced throughout out history, and I think this is Micheal Bay entry to movies like The Hurt Locker or Apocalypse now. Great photography, not as steady as it should be, but them again we are in the middle of a war, the camera work probably is to make us feel that we are in there with these soldiers. For me in general, to say basically the same is an excellent film for those who like war films and Micheal Bay should keep on these track of making film based on reality, but important things, not like in the case of Pain & Gain, or the way he treated that film, maybe every is important in it's own way, and these is just greater."

","Michael Bay's political action movie had some decent acting and a fast-paced plot. It was one of Bay's more thought-provoking and intense action thrillers and a welcome relief from wherever the Transformers series is going. I have enjoyed Michael Bay's films before for their popcorn fun, yet this one take a much more serious tone that handles the subject matter with a modicum of solemnity.<br/><br/>There is a budding tradition of war movies at the beginning of the year from Lone Survivor to American Sniper and now 13 Hours. This movie is at the bottom of the three but still intense enough for fans of the genre. I was drawn right in and even though I saw the late night viewing was able to stay engaged throughout, which is really all I can ask for of a January release.<br/><br/>The acting was superb for the most part. As I was not an avid viewer of The Office American adaptation, John Krasinski was a new face, especially in an action movie. Krasinski's acting was probably the weakest of the bunch but still not bad. His character Jack Silva takes center stage and introduces us to the city of Benghazi, and the viewer follows him through the attack. I think Krasinski was just adjusting to his new role as action star and has a bright future in the genre if he chooses to continue.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"aserdcerebral","3","3","15","5 June 2016"," A movie that exists outside of filmmaking grammar, A potent story denied its rightful telling...
","There are some real dramatic images at the beginning of Michael Bay's Benghazi tale. The shots involve two or more objects of interest, and their emotional and spatial relationships are established in well-defined frames. This is cellphone footage from people who were outrunning bullets and hopscotching landmines at the moment, but still had an idea that drama only exists when we aren't distracted by superficial artifice. You want subscribers to know you were 1)dying from 2)bomb-inflicted 3)lesions after you upload this on YouTube, not that you started out directing music videos. I would have much preferred a feature composed of a thoughtful montage of these clips. <br/><br/>There's a scene in which A Blonde Lady handles a half-eaten apple. She holds it like it's her first meeting with a pome. Perhaps, because Bay couldn't convince her the character she's playing could ever savor an apple at lunchtime; she's not a Character before, during or after lunchtime. No individuality, no quirks, no venom or charm; she and the apple both are only props on the set, although the apple's career unfairly ends in the wastebin much faster than hers, in spite of its more intriguing performance. And to think, she was created out of a real person, into thin air. At one point, another cast member itemizes her neatly, ""I need your eyes and your ears, not your mouth."" Hmm......fitting? Or indeliberate irony.<br/><br/>Then comes a brief moment in which the ""dialogue"" to be exchanged between castmates is, ""hey Prop5, how are the twins?"" And oh, wouldn't you know as much, since the only characterizations Prop5 has are a beard and a photo of Military Backstory toddlers, he's wearing his beard, AND, fondling the said kid pic. Oh, man. ""Crazy cute."" ""Cute.""<br/><br/>For humorous ends, a cast member recalls Ranger School, how once, to express alpha-virility, they rubbed their penises using a superior officer's hat. This is the setup for a joke, and since the joke is about the officer's personality, not dick-wiping, the payoff should be his personal reaction to the nose-wrinkling whiffs of smegma. We never learn this information... wiping's the climax of the joke; Bay demands your laughs without knowing the punchline. Later he'll want tears. Without the...pepper spray, I'm guessing.<br/><br/>That's not to say the movie isn't funny; a guy walks out of a car into an Arab market, and instead of ornate tablecloths, like in Casablanca, he's offered some RPG warheads, and stuff. If you're questioning the sales wisdom of the Libyan vendors, well, it's clearer to them than it is to a silly thinker-person that out here on an Arab street is where a Caucasian guy in a denim shirt would stroll to buy up some high explosive anti-tank munitions. Might be he's on vacation, but, who knows what whims you can stir after flashing the goods.<br/><br/>There are an unforgivable number of incidences of Bay panning across the room, cutting mid-pan, to a static shot on a different side of the room from where the initial rotation would have ended. Why aren't there Razzies for Worst Editing? Perhaps because everyone can easily tell what a bad performance is, but not what is/isn't good editing. So even under Bay, none of the actors are winning so much as Razzies, they stiff their way through what they can, but the editing would out-rasp BvS.<br/><br/>Emotion, Story, Rhythm, Eye-trace, Two-dimensional plane of screen, Three-dimensional space of action; none of that classical nonsense has a place here. Perhaps Michael Bay has only watched music videos and TV ads, and his only-begotten objective for movie-making is to make you maybe buy stuff, even with nothing to sell. More than perhaps.<br/><br/>One way sheepheaded filmmakers always fail us, is failing to understand that an actor on the battlefield having a wife(-and-kids) in flashbacks/cutaways/off-screen isn't yet another dimension. Only honest characterization and uniquely believable drama, arsenic and affection that taste equally real to us existing between them, justifies this device, or tanks it. Could Bay spell drama? That wouldn't explain the tepid video-Chat Scenes between BlackBerrys and MacBook Pros, held by central cast members and throwaway extras representing their sports-ad-girlfriends-cum-wives reading cornfields of clichés to them with passionless investment on either side. ""The girls need you, not a tree house."" If he didn't know that already, miss, he belongs in a caged institution.<br/><br/>There's a cutaway, in which one of these non-figurative young ladies is weep-reading melodramatic exposition (more tree houses!) sideways to a drive-through operator selling her stuff-to-eat from outside a car window. There is no operator, selling, or edible stuff seen in the shots provided by Michael Bay. That's when this evidenced itself as a 0/10 movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie: things blowed and grass growed, because some real-life private-military assets had to protect some Special Agents (American) from equally-real-life Libyan cheap-gun-shooting assets. Wikipedia says.<br/><br/>So, does the movie contain an incisive geopolitical argumentum, constructed out of provable premises and cogent conclusions? Is the Pope Persian? <br/><br/>I did enjoy one scene, involving an American ambassador played by Matt Letscher; he walks up to a podium ready to give the Libyans a Big Speech, and says; ""America.....{suspense}....is here for....{suspense}....you!!"" They know to clap, real climactic, for this is his speech. Way to evaporate rhetoric down to its essence. <br/><br/>This is certainly a story worth telling, by someone with adult-minded storytelling devices. Bay's approach on the other hand, can be summarized by a brief 90s-MTV low-angle shot of a classified document being shredded; ""Read n Destroy,"" contentedly reflects Cast Member #2. It's safe to surmise his screenwriter read the source material, then came to Read n Destroy as a mantra. If only he'd had a half-good memory, a worthwhile movie might have come of it. 3/10. Overly generous, for such execrable film-direction. But hey, Bay does use some practical special effects, and, let's see, David Costabile gives a non-rotten one-chord performance."

","One doesn't expect substance and political significance of Michael Bay but his 13 Hours delivers both in fine, loud style. <br/><br/>The film details the 2012 Libyan terrorist attack upon the US embassy, including the death of the ambassador. The film repeats the government's initial but discredited claim, that he died of smoke inhalation, sparing the fine man's memory the physical abuse and indignity.he reportedly suffered while alive. It also rejects the government's claim there had been no warning of an attack on the under-protected facility.<br/><br/>As in the classic Western, the anti-savagery force is split between the rod-ass by-the-book West Pointer and the intuitive, self-reliant, pragmatic Maverick. Here the disaster is caused by the secret CIA administration's refusal to deploy the nearby corps of contract soldiers on time. <br/><br/>And the political significance? The film implicitly joins the current US presidential debate. Understand, Hollywood films are always reluctant to take sides on any contentious political issue. John Wayne could risk the box office damage making The Green Berets (1968) during the contentious Vietnam War. But the liberal perspective was delivered indirectly. Robert Altman expressed the Left's opposition to an absurd, gory Asian war but set MASH (1970) in the Korean war instead. Scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr knew the costs of being openly political in Hollywood. He was one of the Hollywood Ten blacklisted for supposed communist leanings. Not till Coming Home, The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now eight years later did the Left address the Vietnam war directly. <br/><br/>And so today. The Big Short, by exposing the criminal greed of the banks behind the 2008 economic collapse, with virtually no-one punished, and no systemic changes made to prevent its recurrence, has the side-effect of promoting the economic revolution promised by Bernie Sanders, in contrast to the modest billionaire Trump and big-business-supported Hilary Clinton. <br/><br/>Poor Hilary can't buy a break here. She's not named in13 Hours but the incompetence and callousness of her government implicates her severely, especially as this fiasco happened on her watch, i.,e., is part of the experience edge she claims over Bernie. At the same time the central tension between CIA officer and contract soldier implicitly implicitly plays to the advantage of the brash Donny Trump, maverick deluxe."

","I watched this movie with 2 friends: One of us was occasionally keeping us updated on whats going on, the others were bored to death.<br/><br/>13 Hours is, once again, a movie based on a true story in a warzone where america saves the day. It starrs characters who look the same, act the same and have those cringeworthy lines of ""cool"" dialogue which should make us feel sympathetic towards them.To the writers: No it doesn't! Never in the history of any army movie this has ever worked for me. It's just cliché. Please stop. (And don't ever bring that ""If you don't do anything, americans will die"" line. There literally are allied non-americans fighting with you, and you're killing off hundreds of family fathers, that's just nasty.)
The characters are by far the worst part of this movie. Especially in the last few minutes, where we should feel something as one of them gets buried under what was once a house. But I was just horribly confused as to who died, because they all look and act the same.<br/><br/>I have to admit, when I heard that Michael Bay directed the movie, I expected worse. Of course, there still are some really unnecessary slow motion sequences, but the explosions were almost non-existent. Proud of you Miky <3<br/><br/>The locations are extremely gorgeous, gotta give 'em that.<br/><br/>The actors are fine, they do the best they can with those characters. The effects are quite nice. Nothing special about them. The rockets looked nice I guess.<br/><br/>Now comes the story: It's based on true events, which can be interesting (see Kursk). And here, it's also an interesting event, almost unbelievable. And yet, the writers messed it up with uninteresting, replaceable characters.<br/><br/>In essence, this movie is a giant wasted opportunity to create a menacing atmosphere in an unescapable situation."

","I don't really know any of the IRL politics... but watching this movie, the americans are occupying foreign countries, living in a mansion surround by an oasis, high-fiving each other for changing the politics of the countries they're in. Meanwhile the citizens of this country live in poverty, and are bullyed around by americans there on a military mission.<br/><br/>So I totally understand the great injustice the people of these countries feel and why they are angry at America. The humanization of the american soldiers feels out of place... instead of wimpering about their wives and children, Michael Bay should have went all-in on the bad guy angle and made them misogynistic women beaters. They could've shown their wives cheating on them while they were away on a mission to explain all their pent up anger.<br/><br/>But instead, I end up really conflicted. It's like the americans are the only ones with wives and children, their mission is completely immoral and insensitive, but because John Krasinski has such a big smile, I'm supposed to cheer for them? I dunno. Maybe it's because I'm not racist, or maybe it's because I'm not American, but I didn't really feel compelled to cheer for the good guys at any point during this movie.

"ytts13","5","1","3","9 January 2020"," Bay Goes BLACK HAWK DOWN
","Entertaining enough for what it is and reasonably sober-minded, but Michael Bay is absolutely the wrong director for this kind of film. Even his attempt and gritty, claustrophobic realism is seeped in all of his signature high-contrast, saturated, fast-cutting slow-mo chaos that he's so excels in, replete with the iconic bottle rocket explosions. In other words, exactly the opposite sort of vibe you want in your ""BIG SERIOUS MOVIE ABOUT BIG SERIOUS THING"". In other words, it's PEARL HARBOR all over again, except even more burdened by politics but thankfully free of ineptly-drawn love triangles.<br/><br/>The cast all perform with remarkable aplomb, but these characters aren't particularly deep or complex, and the only reliability seems to come from the actors' natural charisma rather than a particularly good script. Technically everything is equally on-point; Dion Beebe's grainy and nerve-wracking nighttime cinematography has shades of MIAMI VICE '06 and Lorne Balfe's pounding score keeps the tempo up, but it's all stuff that's been seen before and that's been handled better. Like it's direct predecessors BLACK HAWK DOWN and LONE SURVIVOR, 13 HOURS can't seem to decide whether to be a solemn, moment-by-moment documentation of a situation gone horribly wrong, or a CALL OF DUTY speedrun. It's a problem that exists in many war movies, but here Bay's direction just emphasizes the dichotomy with the subtly of a sledgehammer and takes away from what could've been something so much better."

He took a more factual and documentary angle with this film about the tragedy in Benghazi. And it really didn't take political stance. Never was Hilary's name mentioned nor her title. Only that additional security or reinforcements were requested several times and ignored. The movie was more about the soldiers and how they handled each tense situation. Of course it had the tell- tale scenes of showing soldiers talking or thinking about their families before battle scenes to ratchet up the emotions. It could have been stronger if more backstory was there for why there was so much tension with Lybia to begin with and why was the embassy continually asking for increased security and defense.

","This is a great movie, up there with American Sniper. I saw it tonight, weeks after its premier. The theater was packed. I had delayed because of some mediocre reviews by what I found out were politically motivated ideologues. In truth, there is absolutely nothing political about this movie. This movie is simply an intense, hour-by-hour account of what happened during the Benghazi disaster. I predict this movie will continue to rise in popularity by word-of-mouth.<br/><br/>I appreciate the great attention to detail of the writers and director. The set-up to the Benghazi disaster and battle scenes are excellent. The actors portraying the contractors are credible and believable.<br/><br/>No politician is referenced during the movie, but by the end of the movie, reasonable viewers must ask, ""what idiot approved the Libya mission?"" The answer is obvious: just as a general is responsible for his failed campaign, here, Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, is responsible for the failed Libya campaign and the Benghazi disaster.<br/><br/>Even a novice in security or military matters must ask: What was the defense plan for the Diplomatic outpost? What was the extraction plan in case of overwhelming attack? Reading the book or watching this movie leads one to the conclusion that there was no plan for back-up defense or extraction of personnel. Apparently, Hillary Clinton wanted the Benghazi operation to be very low profile, with few personnel or assets involved. The low key approach might have been understandable, if, and only if, there was a solid plan for back up defense assets and evacuation of personnel. Hillary Clinton's plan appears to have been, ""let's go in with good intentions and hope for the best."" The most troubling issue in the Benghazi disaster remains, ""how did the terrorists obtain so much detailed information on the U.S. compounds and the plans and location of the Ambassador and his staff and CIA personnel?"" One obvious possibility is that Hillary Clinton's hacked e-mails (now known to contain ""operational intelligence"") revealed the location and plans of the Ambassador and CIA. The potential further implication of Hillary may explain why the State Department (Obama) refuses to release e-mails containing the operational intelligence.<br/><br/>In any event, this movie makes clear that once the prolonged 13 hour attack began, no one in the U.S. government was willing to send in significant rescue assets. It is also clear that the contractors involved behaved heroically, even though they were abandoned by their government. Sadly, the entire disaster was being viewed in real-time by government bureaucrats via drone camera. Thus, bureaucrats and politicians cannot claim ignorance of the critical nature of the situation. To this day, the U.S. compounds have not been reclaimed by the U.S., and terrorists swim in the dead ambassador's pool. Sadly, Libya is now an ISIS stronghold, and ISIS is in possession of U.S. supplied weapons. Someone deserves to go to prison for the Libya/Benghazi disaster."

Fortunately for them, this movie doesn't get too deep into the politics of the entire situation and, obviously, doesn't name names, although I wish it had. The movie, instead, dwells on the heroic efforts made by a few brave Americans who defied orders and went to help costing the lives of two of them.<br/><br/>One review, however, irked me to no end. This idiot claims that the entire movie is fantasy, that no ""Stand down"" order was given and then, as typical for Obama Zombies, tries to bring Bush up. I don't care how many so-called committees say to the contrary, actual soldiers who were there state emphatically that a 'Stand down"" order was given, not once, but several times. The reviewer evens continues the idiotic narrative that the attack was spontaneous over a stupid video. I guess he doesn't know that it has been disproven and even admitted to by the administration. He also says Obama was in the Oval Office. It has NEVER been revealed where Obama was. He was apparently not in the White House, much less the Oval Office. If so, why wasn't he in the situation room watching the drone feed like he was on the Bin Laden raid. Rumor is he was in LA with Beyoncé! Democrats try to blame the request for additional security denials on Republican budget cuts. Give me a break! The opposite is true. More money was available than ever before, but improper management of the State Department is the culprit. BTW, another reviewer said he disagreed with the movie saying Stevens died of smoke inhalation. First of all, in the heat of the moment in real time, that was the information relayed to the men. Plus, even though his body had been abused, that is still the official cause of death. Please folks, get your facts straight. I know liberals will NEVER accept the fact that this administration cost four Americans their lives, but it's the truth.

But I'm glad director Michael Bay doesn't focus on that, I'm glad he makes it be about the heroes and I think that's the right way to go about telling this tragic story. 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI is intense, it's explosive, it's the best war movie since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" and it's one of those movies that solely aims to make you feel patriotic.<br/><br/>Based on Mitchel Zukoff's book and adapted by Chuck Hogan who gave us 2010's ""The Town,"" 13 HOURS is about those long bloody 13 hours when the U.S. embassy and compound in Libya were under attack, it's about the security team defending their place, it's like a modern day Alamo story.<br/><br/>With the timing of this film's arrival, will the mainstream media blow this out of proportions again with theories on whether or not Secretary Hillary Clinton did all she could to send help, if the attack was motivated by anti-Islam video protests and so on and so forth, will it spark the controversies again? I don't know, that's out of my control. What I do know and what I do appreciate about 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI, although it slightly touches on those possible theories, it keeps the focus tight on these few men, these few former soldiers who have families, who have real struggles, but they're willing to protect the lives of others first.<br/><br/>13 HOURS: THE SECRET SODLIERS OF BENGHAZI has everything you'd expect in a Michael Bay, it's action-packed, it has that signature spinning shot, heavy emphasis on explosions, lots of firepower, beautiful women, it even has similar VFX shots that Bay applied on his 2001 war film, ""Pearl Harbor,"" but minus the lovey dovey romance, thankfully. Those who know me well know that I'm not a Michael Bay fan, but this 13 HOURS is just a good old fashion good guy vs. bad guy. Very testosterone-driven. Of course real life conflicts in the real world are much greyer and more nuanced than that, so perhaps audiences would be divided over this but this film, for what it's trying to do, it does its job, and it doesn't demonize the Muslims, and it doesn't shy away either, it's as gritty and as violent as it gets, it will make you feel uncomfortable about the idea of war or killing somebody without diminishing the courage of these few men who at the end of the day just want to go home to their families.

","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a film that I wanted to love. Michael Bay tackling something more serious, coupled with a great cast; what could go wrong? Quite a bit in my opinion. The first hour of this film is completely run of the mill if you've seen any modern war film. We're introduced to our characters and quickly informed of their past and the fact that they're fathers putting it all on the line for their families. However, the decent performances and humorous dialogue kept me engaged for the most part. Once you get past the uninteresting first act, the bullets start flying. This is where the film should completely shine, but in my opinion did not, mostly due to the poor cinematography and shaky shot selection. What's the point in staging fantastic action sequences if you're not even going to film it properly and in a way where it's comprehensible for the audience. I enjoy the use of shaky cam. When it's used tastefully, it can add a visceral edge to the shot, however, 13 Hours completely overuses this concept to a nauseating level. If you can look past the poor shot selection, you can see that the film does do a decent job of building suspense during certain scenes and it also properly portrays the relationship of soldiers on the battlefield. That being said, when characters started to bite the dust, I did not care in the slightest and the film really expected me to. In the end, 13 Hours is a decent war film that takes entirely too long to become interesting. When it finally does, I found myself wishing and hoping for a steady, wide shot or something a bit more smooth. There are a few sequences that I found really cool, and the audio design is spot on. Put up against other films like Saving Private Ryan, or Band of Brothers, this film doesn't stand a chance. On it's own, this film is completely fine while paying respects to the men and women who serve to protect us daily."

","I'm not a fan of US movies post-2000. I'm a 20C person (60+). There are 2 movies that stick in my mind as every bit as great as any war movie I've ever seen from the 20C. One is Blackhawk Down. This is the other. 
The first thing that strikes me is the ordinariness of the characters portrayed. Interesting ordinary, not dull as ditch-water. Colourful personalities, but not your shouting, yelling, whooppee, hurrah, US Marine yelping, swearing and 'shouting for America' types. Their like normal guys trained to fight. I'd feel comfortable having a drink with them. They're respectful, but also highly trained, experienced, not a little world weary and cynical, and looking forward to get back to Home and Family, and staying there. But they have a job to do. A thankless, unappreciated job. 
The director IMHO, didn't make a single wrong move here. Undoubtedly there will be those who spend the entire movie 'looking for gaffs'. I feel sorry for them... For me it was as realistic a depiction of an intense and intensely confusing battle ground as I've ever seen on screen. The fog of war is right here on camera. It is very well done. 
The most frightening aspect is the 'who are the good guys and who the bad' that can never be answered from moment to moment... That is terrifying, even on screen. Can't imagine it on scene, in reality. That those guys came through all that alive, if bloodied, is a tribute not just to their training but to their strength of character. I'm not a fan of the US, but these guys would be heroes anywhere... 
its a fitting tribute to the real soldiers who fought that battle for 13 hours."

","13 HOURS is an exemplary true story war thriller set in Benghazi in 2012, where a number of US contractors working for the CIA found themselves under siege by an army of Libyan militants determined to destroy outside influence in their country in the aftermath of Colonel Gaddafi's demise. The film follows a siege scenario as various tough, trained figures attempt to defend two separate compounds from the murderous militants, and despite a lengthy running time this is never less than edge-of-the-seat great. The real surprise is that it was directed by Michael Bay and is far and away his best movie, head and shoulders above his usual bombastic flag-waving silliness. This goes for taught realism throughout and has some wonderful action set-pieces which utilise amazing sets, effects, and camerawork to put the viewer into the heart of pitched gun battles and the like. Intensity is the keyword here and as such the running time absolutely flies past. I can't recommend this enough; it's the best action-based modern-day military thriller I've seen since BLACK HAWK DOWN and is of a similar quality."

","If you were surprised by the recent news that NBC's ""The Office's"" pretty boy John Krasinski is gonna be the next Jack Ryan, then you haven't possible seen his against-typecasting projects such as ""13 Hours"" or, say, ""Promised Land"".<br/><br/>This one is a modern war movie about American elite soldiers in Libya at its most dangerous times, defending unofficial CIA base from local militants.<br/><br/>Krasinski doesn't kick ass here yet - as Jack Ryan, he has to, surely - but he can shoot bad guys from afar as well as the next guy. Also, tallness and beard help to make a real man out of boyish-looking man, no?<br/><br/>Kidding aside, he looks the part - which is good because this is mostly what the screenplay expects from the stars here. This, and couple of video calls to families, to show their human side.<br/><br/>It's directed by Michael Bay, so you can expect two things: a lot of explosive action and the movie being longer than needed.<br/><br/>At 144 minutes, the never ending war porn does get tiring, especially as the story stays on the shallow side. We don't get to see anything from Libyan side. Maybe the original cut lasting four hours would be deeper and richer content-wise.<br/><br/>So it gets too monotonous for my taste - all shooting and no strong story - but I am not particularly interested in modern war movies, so I may not the best judge of ""13 Hours"" and its qualities.<br/><br/>But the other critics don't seem to like it much either (50/100 from Rotten Tomatoes, 48/100 from Metacritic), so this does say something. Probably. The site users are kinder: 7.3/10 from IMDb, 82/100 from Rotten Tomatoes, 6.8/10 from Metacritic.<br/><br/>What is surprising, is that Bay managed to pull all this off for paltry 50 million USD budget. These days, he's more used to directing movies three-four times more expensive, due to the man devoting his life for ""Transformers"" franchise.<br/><br/>By the way, ""13 Hours"" is based on a true story, and a book that was written about it. Filmed in Malta and Morocco."
"latounga-61310","8","1","4","23 November 2016"," When Michael Bay decides to do more effort...
","This movie is probably the last good thing we see from Director Michael Bay... I hate the movies this guy makes, except for the first Bad Boys and the Rock, the rest of his movies, let's just say that they aren't that well made in some aspects, but oh boy he did made something here. I won't say that this is the movie that is going to redefine him but at least he made a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>So, what is this movie all about? Well, 13 Hours tells the story of what happened in Benghazi through the perspective of the personnel involved in this huge mess of a sh*t show. 13 Hours actually tells the story really well and they actually filled everything with the most detail as possible but it had some minor flaws in the story, but I can't really blame the Writers or the Director because this event is really tricky and filled with a lot of questions still to this very day but they where really good in something! This movie was not an America or Pro-War propaganda, it was actually a well told and very humble story produced on the screen, and you know this is true when a movie can put some nails here and there and can actually provoke and shock the viewer, not make him idolize war, because let's be honest, this movie crushes everything when the main character just suggests that he doesn't want to die in a country that he wasn't even suppose to be there fighting a war that is not is own without the help of his country and then in the aftermath we see the conclusion in booth sides and if you pay close attention you see that a lot was lost in booth sides in that day... And this is another plus because I wasn't expecting this type of stuff from M. Bay.<br/><br/>So first off the acting! It's pretty good, everyone brought their best effort to honor the real people that where there. John Krasinski did an amazing job in the most powerful and dramatic scenes and was really good overall. Same for James Badge Dale, Dominic Fumusa, Peyman Moaadi, Max Martini and etc with a small standout performance by Pablo Schreiber.<br/><br/>Now, the technical aspects of the movie... Well this movie breeds with a lot of details in every shot, the only complain I have here is something that I have on every Michael Bay movie, which is the over use of sparks in some bullet hits and in some explosions. Now the camera work, well it's actually really good, the cinematography is great and the CGI was also really good. I don't want to spoil, but the is a scene where the camera just follows a something through the air until it lands and it is a really good shot. The movie also does something great, it doesn't hide the horrors and violence that this guys went through all night! This movie is gruesome and I have to say that sometimes it kinda goes too far...<br/><br/>So I really liked this movie, it isn't a great movie or a masterpiece of cinema, it isn't a Saving Private Ryan or a Black Hawk Down, but it is up there with some of the best in this genre."
"bodhi-13262","7","1","4","22 November 2016"," ""It ain't over till it's over.""
","'13 Hours' is another (non-robot) Michael Bay film, which tells the true events about the contracted soldiers which defended a US compound on September 11th 2012. Does it deliver as well as it should? And was justice done in the retelling of this true story?<br/><br/>1. Just going on the premise of watching this as a movie with no factual attachments, '13 Hours' is indeed a really good film. However, if you're going into this as being just another ""balls-to- the-wall' action flick, you'd be wrong. The best advantage of this film is that it's more of a suspenseful thriller when it comes down to it. From the beginning, we get small doses of the job that these men undertake on a daily basis when it comes to defending their country's interests. We also see just how dangerous of a 'fail- state' Libya is, and the paranoia that your life can be at risk any moment really churns your stomach.<br/><br/>2. The casting was terrific, and I believe this is James Badge Dale's (Rone) movie to carry. He has the most charisma and physicality in part of his acting, and you can't help but like his character. I honestly thought it was a mistake to make John Krasinski (Silva) the ""poster-boy"" of this film. I say that due to the fact that he plays the average'man with no special qualities to him other than the fact that he has a family he wants to return to. Not saying he's bad, but he only gets one heartbreaking moment at the very end where we finally see him shine as an actor. I like Krasinski, but like I said, Dale is the better bet.<br/><br/>3. I know many critics condemn Michael Bay based on the 'Transformers' films, but people really need to let that go, cause Bay works extremely well when he's directing a non sci-fi movie. Bay is also overly known for being an action director, but this film is probably his least action-filled movie to date. Not saying that's a bad thing, but throughout the film we only get small doses of action. I'm sure the script writers adapted the events as accurately as they could, but I think this movie really needed an extended and edgy climatic action sequence. However, that's just my personal opinion overall if I had to nit-pick lol.<br/><br/>I was hoping that this film would be just as or even more gripping than a similar one like 'Lone Survivor', but it does simply an ""okay"" job non-the-less. I'd say this is up there with Michael Bay's better films, and I would heavily recommend it."

There is also some drama in the movie especially in some scenes where the soldiers miss their homes and families.Of course they don't care of the families of the people they kill by tens just to save the American ambassador.

If this had been a Little League game, the ""Mercy Rule"" would have stopped this fiasco when the score got to be around USA 20, Libya 2, but there are no baseball teams in Benghazi. However, 13 HOURS director Michael Bay is not content to just show how each American is worth 50 foreigners, but insists upon adding his own personal political spin to this story. Bay seems to be arguing that Americans should be prohibited from traveling outside our U.S. borders. We've already forbidden trips to Cuba for decades, and our fellow U.N. member North Korea currently has put the dangerous Outside World off-limits to its own citizens. Bay is urging us with 13 HOURS to end taxpayer funding of the C.I.A., as well as calling for the closing of all U.S. Embassies and foreign military bases. He is showing us that it would have been far cheaper, far more effective, and far more practical (as well as saving thousands of American lives and trillions of taxpayer dollars) if we'd simply nuked Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan when the governments of these two rogue nations allowed 19 Saudi hijackers directed by a Saudi holed up in Afghanistan to ruin Normal Life in America on Sept. 11, 2001 (footage of which begins his movie).

"alexwerchowski","9","1","5","23 February 2017"," Great Movie
","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a movie directed by Michael Bay so you know what that means. Explosions. Lots of Explosions. The movie is depicted in a great way that displays the attack of the embassy in Benghazi. It starts off a little slow before the last hour of it is an intense, gory battle scene where Navy Seals fight for their lives and the lives of others. On the topic of how gory this movie is, I would not plan on eating popcorn at the end of this movie in the battle that takes place. There is blood everywhere, bodies get ripped to shreds and other brutal injuries that some of the guys take while trying to fight for their lives. I have watched a lot of war movies and TV series so I was used to the blood and gore, but for people who do not like that stuff, I would be cautious to watch this movie. Don't get me wrong though, how realistic this movie is with the gore is what makes it so easy to stay locked into it. You could tell that the actors put a lot of work into making themselves look like real Navy Seals. All of the actors are in the best shape possible with most of them having big bodies with six packs and beards of grown men. Michael Bay uses a lot of low angle shots to make the actors look very powerful as Navy Seals compared to the enemy they were fighting against. I felt like I was watching actual Navy Seals interacting with each other and fighting together. There was one scene in particular in the movie I didn't like because of it being unrealistic. An armored car takes a heavy amount of fire on it making it almost unusable with bullet holes everywhere, all tires flat and the front of the car on fire while still driving miles to safety. Because of this for a second it leaves you wondering how that was possible. This does not take away from the value of the movie, it is just something you should be aware of and that some instances in this movie could make you question a movie from reality which you just have to look past. Aside from that, the acting in this movie was great. Everyone does a great job in their parts. John Krasinski who plays Jack Silva in the movie has a couple emotional scenes where he does a great job of not looking like he is faking a cry. He and James Badge Dale who plays Rone get along in a casual way that makes it look like two buddies who are childhood friends in real life. The whole squad of guys that are Navy Seals in the movie do a great job of looking like one compact brotherhood that solidifies their unit and would make them do anything for each other. Overall, I would give this movie a great rating. It is a Michael Bay film so of course there are going to be some things that are going to make you be like ""Was that really necessary?"" but aside from those instances the story is told very well. I think that the people who went through all this in real life deserved a film about them in their honor and that the actors did a great job of displaying their story. I would recommend this movie to any person who enjoys a good war movie to go see this movie."

","I am always a bit dubious about war/combat films as often they are heavily biased so I approached this film with some apprehension. The slow start didn't engage me straight away, but it became very clear that the whole tone of the film was very different from the usual. The film portrays men in combat without the need to include stereotypes; the characters were depicted in such a way that gave them depth and complexity and almost an ordinariness. There is very little political comment regarding the situation in Benghazi throughout the film, although there were some allusions to the men being abandoned by US military; however, this was done very subtly, as opposed to Oliver Stone in-yer-face, which was actually more effective. I'm not familiar with any of the actors other than Toby Stevens, but the quality of the performances all round was exceptional. The horror and loss were felt in equal measure, and the sense of having to persevere in the face of the odds being increasingly stacked up against them, built up over the course of the final showdown. I disagreed with some of the reviews that the film was too long, and feel the preamble was necessary to the whole plot; these men were intended to be bodyguards and ended up in the middle of a war-zone, so the soft start was entirely appropriate. This is a great film which appears to have been largely overlooked, and I hope it gets more recognition now it can be streamed."

It turns out the director portrayed everything exactly the way it happened. The acting in this movie is amazing, both the CIA and the soldiers. The characters are so rich and deep, it still gives me goose bumps thinking about them. The actors keep your eyes glued to the screen and transmit authentic feelings.

"Samiam3","7","1","5","7 June 2016"," A better Bay
","13 Hours reminded me a little We Were Soldiers. This is a very literal war movie, a movie about exactly what you see on the screen and seldom anything deeper (like politics). What you see is survival, street-smarts, comradery and a lot of violence. This is no Saving Private Ryan, but it's not a movie of cheep thrills either. What it amounts to is an intelligent action movie. <br/><br/>With the exemption of a couple of shots, Michael Bay successfully rises above his pornographic tendencies to make a movie that is 'mostly' unsexy, which is probably the highest compliment anyone can give him. Of course, he has a long way to go to become a good dramatist. The battle sequences are convincing and even immersing (despite the shaky cam), however there were times when it felt like less would have been more. <br/><br/>A little less violence and a little more introspective dialog would have certainly made 13 Hours more worthy of a two and a half hour running length. There are moments when you can see John Krasinski and James Badge Dale start to sparkle a bit as actors, but unfortunately the introspective scenes are too few to make characters out of any of these soldiers. <br/><br/>Most of the violence takes place at night, and Michael Bay opts for a rather surrealist style of lighting that resembles Dario Argento films. Every second bulb in the frame radiates green light. This is a gorgeously lit movie, perhaps even a little too much so. Michael Bay, being who he his, can help but prefer to show sunlight only in the more romantic golden hours of the day, at dusk and dawn. By contrast, in a film like Hurt Locker, the sun is white hot and blinding, and completely unromantic.<br/><br/>I won't deny that it is refreshing to see a Michael Bay movie where an explosion from a rocket impact is not something to dazzle with a fireball but something that is visibly destructive and very real. 13 Hours can be appreciated if you come at it from a right angle."
"PartialMovieViewer","10","2","16","19 January 2016"," Good Movie...Thanks for Countless Questions
","As in anything produced by Hollyweird, the 'entire true story' is always missing. I feel Mr. Bay did what he could, ending up delivering a good product. The producers and directors are driven by meeting a bottom-line and not hitching their wagons to any 'truth-wagon.' I am sure he would have made tons more cash if all the cats were let out of the bag. All he needed for a huge payday is for the lefty critics to unleash their ideological hell hounds loose soiling newspapers across the land. I mean, what difference, at this point, does it make? I guess you could ask the families of those who were needlessly lost. Anyways, kudos to Michael Bay, for tempering the story in the way he did, and delivering a message providing more questions than answers. The viewers can do their own research and reach their own conclusions – whether it ends up being, ""more needs to be reviewed by those in power"" - ""we have enough and opt to drop the whole thing"" – or just plain adhering to the bobble-head defense about that video causing the nonexistent protests. I am truly surprised this flick came out at all. With the political atmosphere in Tinsel-Town, I am glad to see Bay is still gainfully employed. I thought the movie was a good depiction of what little I know about the actual attacks. I did not see those protests brought on by some video (sarcasm), yet I still feel the directing and camera work reflects Mr. Bay's attention to detail – all were excellent. All the actors did an outstanding job, I think - at least. You see, I was not there, so I don't know what happened. I do feel the station chief was treated heavy-handedly. I don't know his full job or his real orders...I shouldn't. The Ambassador should have had his protection in the first place, where was it? It's almost as though the station chief was portrayed in a way that he would be viewed as the scapegoat for the entire mess, almost intended to deflect attention from the more influential players. I mean, part of his job was protecting that compound and his minions and not leaving his worker-bees unguarded Besides, each one of these people at the 'compound' appeared to have no weapons training at all. Technically, it was not the mission of his small detail of contractors to step upeven if these heroes are wired to do so. Conjecture on my part, but I would think people higher up should have authorized a military response – that's only my guess – and it obviously never came. This is such a sad story that should never have happened. There is so much to this movie and so much for the viewer to look up. Even though I will never know the entire story, my conclusion (at this time): With all the disgusting falsities, ginned up by highest leadership (?) and ignored duplicity sanctified by that same ilk, the events before and after sound more like implausible fiction than what it was, some elaborate politically driven three card Monte scheme. It is time to get grown-ups running the show. But that is only my conclusion. I highly recommend this movie, even if the tale is hard to digest. Cinematographically this might not meet all those required by those professional ""Movie Goers"" – I definitely don't really know, since I am no self- proclaimed cinema snob. Nor do my twenty years in the military paint me as any more of an authority than anyone else who was not thrown under the Bengahzi Bus. All I know is that I enjoyed the movie."

","Teamwork was very evident through this movie. From the beginning the audience can easily pick up that the five soldiers of the group who were already in Syria are very low key and accepting of new teammates. Though the names are not often mentioned boldly, to get the effect of the one team vibe, if you listen carefully you can pick up most of the characters' names. The group is easily accepting and instantly treat new members like they have been part of the team for years. Even in the most serious of battles and injuries they throw the joking comments back and forth at each other. Perseverance was one of the many strong themes of this movie as well. It was added into the movie fantastically with one hundred percent perfection. The main characters of the movie blatantly show perseverance just by being in the military; they also show their perseverance by standing for not only the Ambassador but also America by staying and fighting with just six soldiers for hours when nobody else would fight with them. When everything went downhill they fought their hardest and had hope they would make it through to the end. Faith was one of the smaller themes but it still had a big part in the movie. I think faith was what tied in every other theme; like perseverance and teamwork, because in order to persevere one has to have faith things are going to turn out for the better and won't end up in ashes. One also needs to have faith in their team in order to work together and be as good of a team as the team of six is. I would rate 13 Hours a 5 of 5 because I thought the themes were tied in nicely with each other. Not only did the scriptwriters, producers, and directors do a good job of making them all tie in together, but the actors were amazing. They did an excellent job of adding these three themes into their acting and then making it also have an eccentric personality, making the audience forget they are not actually meeting the group in real life. I also liked that even though they are in a war- zone in the middle of a war, the filming crew and scriptwriters were very careful not to put in too many battle scenes and they added some lightheartedness during the times in the movie when there wasn't a battle scene. Overall, this movie is definitely one I would recommend to pretty much anyone. I think 13 Hours is the best movie I have seen that has such powerful example of some of the most important values; it will by far be the one to beat."
"The Grand Master","9","1","6","23 July 2016"," Excellently done and certainly one of Michael Bay's better movies.
","13 Hours was a movie that was excellently done by the much maligned Michael Bay and it also shows that you don't need any megastars to feature in a huge movie. The combat scenes are unflinchingly realistic similar to Black Hawk Down (2001) and from start to finish the entire movie was intense and I found myself glued to my seat the entire time.<br/><br/>Based on the real life Benghazi attack that occurred on 11 September 2012, 13 hours focuses on the private military contractors stationed in Benghazi including as Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods (James Badge Dale, The Departed), Jack Silva (John Krasinski, The Office), Mark ""Oz"" Geist (Max Martini, Saving Private Ryan ), John ""Tig"" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa, Nurse Jackie), Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber, The Wire), and Dave ""Boon"" Benton (David Denman, The Office). The private contractors answer to ""The Chief"" (David Costabile, Breaking Bad) who constantly reminds them to avoid conflict with the locals to preserve an international incident, until the contractors overrule him once the diplomatic compound comes under attack. Without any further military support the military contractors and the rest of the embassy staff members find themselves fighting for survival and utilising their old military skills against the large number of militants armed to the teeth with automatic weapons, rockets and other assorted weapons.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent including the ever reliable James Badge Dale and in a surprise casting John Krasinski who is often well known for comedic roles. Michael Bay frequently receives a critical mauling for his movies but this time he has done an excellent job. Right up there amongst Bad Boys (1995), The Rock (1996), Transformers (2007) and Pain & Gain (2013) this is one of Michael Bay's better movies.<br/><br/>All political controversy aside, 13 Hours was an excellent movie from start to finish which has told the story that needed to be told and given the Benghazi attack justice.<br/><br/>9/10."
"derekfane","10","1","6","11 June 2016"," Honestly one of the best films I've ever seen
","I have seen absolutely loads of films of all genres and styles and 13 Hours: Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is one of the best. Michael Bay does an absolutely excellent job of depicting the events of 2012 in Libya where there was controversy over support not being given to the brave men and women involved in this incident. I felt like the cast were absolutely sensational in particular, James Badge Dale as Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods, John Krasinski as Jack Silva and Pablo Schreiber as Kris ""Tonto"" Paronto. The rest and supportive cast are great too but those 3 are the standouts. The film doesn't feel like a true story but more like a straight up action film however this is good as it kind of takes your mind off of the story of you already know what happened in real life. The film, while it seems very long, is 2 hours and 24 minutes of absolutely genius filmmaking and I think Michael Bay gives us one of his best movies to date. The only concern is in every single explosion in the movie, I don't understand the need for there to be sparks flying around during them all. It's his trademark in a way but I'm not a fan of his explosions. Aside from that, no complaints whatsoever about this movie and I honestly couldn't see anyone else playing these characters. I heard Mark Wahlberg was considered to play Tyrone Woods but I'm glad he didn't. Fantastic movie, fantastic cast, fantastic directing. Overall I give it a 10/10. Recommend it to anyone who doesn't really know of the real life story. It puts a lot of things into perspective. It's also good because it puts a bit of heat on Hilary Clinton's bid for president as she was known to have played a very important role in doing absolutely nothing to help the brave men who risked everything for their countries."
"DanLives1980","8","1","6","11 June 2016"," Action Packed Documentarian Butt Clencher
","I'm shocked that this is a Michael Bay movie. Everything I don't like about his directorial efforts (excessive slow motion cuts, glossy over the top music video production, corny action scenes) is missing from this movie. I went in without any knowledge or expectations and came out thrilled! 13 Hours is, if anything, a mercenary take (or if you prefer, private security contractor) on Black Hawk Down, immersing us into an escalating situation between the CIA and the extremist factions of Benghazi after the death of Muammar Gaddafi.<br/><br/>Although there is a little corniness, as I have come to expect from modern warfare biopic action thrillers (Act of Valor) it's not distracting to me and there's only ever enough to drive up emotional investment in the lead characters, which are mostly very easy to like regardless.<br/><br/>The cast is a minor stroke of genius. James Badge Dale clearly enjoys portraying military characters since his lead role in The Pacific and delivers yet again. John Krasinsky makes a phenomenal change from the role he's best known for - Jim Halpert in the The Office (USA).<br/><br/>And Max Martini lends solid support yet again after apparently having learned to bench press bulldozers or something. But the biggest surprise and character investment of all comes down to ""Tanto"" portrayed by Pablo Schreiber, who was by far my favourite and had me on the edge of my seat a fair few times.<br/><br/>13 Hours, thanks to the writing of Chuck Hogan (The Strain) and Bay's much sharper pacing, doesn't try to glorify either the politics or the violence. It sets up a disaster in the making with dramatic precision and provides just enough light relief for you to know that things are going to go from bad to worse.<br/><br/>And it does raise politics, in fact, and polarises viewers, because it isn't here to take sides. It was made to tell a true life story as it happened and why. And I do love that the CIA took a boot to the arse as a result.<br/><br/>Very impressive. Watch it with Lone Survivor and Black Hawk Down."

I noticed that the beginning of the film noted that the film was a true story. It that is accurate, and the film is true in most every detail then no one who was responsible for our in-action on that fateful day should ever be allowed to serve in public office. Americans are supposed to look out for each other no matter what.

","So for a Michael Bay movie, this wasn't over the top with dumb jokes thrown in all over the place. This isn't a very intelligent movie that delves into the politics. However it does a good job of focusing in the on the characters and give them actual personalities that the viewers can connect with. The plot is about Private Military Contractor team that are stationed in ,Benghazi, Libya and take on tasks that deals with security. But things start to get horribly wrong when a army of Islamic militants that are angry start attacking. For a Michael Bay movie it doesn't focus in on just the explosions but he actually tried to make it a military movie with some pretty darn good action sequences in it. I thought it was odd to put a actor like John Krasinski as a military guy in a movie such as this. I thought the actor pulled it off pretty well. He had the balance of being a tall every day guy with common sense that is fit and built but doesn't constantly act like a butch robotic killing machine. Despite his experience in the military he doesn't come off like a typical military guy in movies that tries to act tough all the time and I liked that because it was refreshing. Overall I thought this was a well done movie worth a watch. Nothing amazing or anything like that but it's worth a watch. I would have given it a higher score if the build up was a bit more interesting. Instead of it being the typical military characters build up with them having families so the audiences can have more of an attachment with them.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi<br/><br/>The best part about the US embassy is that you don't have to remove your footwear when you invade it.<br/><br/>Mind you, the Islamic militants in this true story don't seem to care either way.<br/><br/>On the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, contract soldiers (John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, Dominic Fumusa) working in Benghazi must protect the US Ambassador to Libya (Matt Letscher) and the embassy from hoards of angry rebels.<br/><br/>But as their defenses fall and their supplies deplete, these former Navy SEALs must prepare for the inevitable.<br/><br/>The dramatic retelling of the 2012 events that inspired the bestselling book on the anniversary attacks, 13 Hours is a surprisingly humane story from the usually bombastic Michael Bay.

","The film is set in 2012 after the fall of the Kadhafi dictatorship in Libya, the CIA has a secret compound in Benghazi protected by 6 private soldiers. During the unofficial visit of the US Ambassador in the city, his residency is taking into assault by anti-American militia on the 11th of September, the CIA contractors are the only ones able to respond.<br/><br/>Usually Michael Bay's movies are seen only as brainless action movies with a lot of explosions especially with the Transformers movies. This movie is still what you can expect from action movie, it is well directed and incredibly breathtaking due to the short timeline during which the film is set. The tension is intense with this group of soldiers facing an army with no support coming from the US or their allies. The film gives an brilliant homage to this soldiers who fought to protect the lives of the agents and the CIA staff.<br/><br/>The film is well written, transcribing the events of this night still pointing the absence of intervention from the government even if they were possibilities to send air support. It also subjects that this attacks were premeditated. Nevertheless it does not denounce someone in particular for the non intervention and prefer leaving the spectator with this question (and others) in order to concentrate on the bravery of the men."
"Jerghal","6","1","6","29 May 2016"," Patriotic, militaristic and too long
","The original cut of the film was 4 hours long. They 'managed' to cut it down to 145 minutes, the length that most Michael Bay films seem to have but it's still too long. Cutting another 25 minutes would have made it snappier. '13 Hours' is a rather patriotic flick about soldiers protecting a CIA compound in Libia after an ambassador is killed. The characters are not very properly introduced or fleshed out so you won't care much about them. They use a lot of military slang which might help to make it sound more authentic it also adds to the confusion. The battle scenes are in Bay's tradition filmed in a very chaotic fashion, sometimes it's difficult to see what's going on. In reality it probably was that way but it doesn't have to be for the spectators. All in all it's an okay film -I wasn't bored or anything- but it feels too patriotic (the word 'American' is used plenty) and military centric (the diplomats and chiefs come off as incompetent nerds while the soldiers save the day)."
"baqari-com","9","1","6","12 April 2016"," The director of The Rock is back...
","I'm not gonna say much about the movie itself, as it's a must see for any action movie fan.<br/><br/>My real surprise here was the directing. It really got me thinking. I mean was the story really that good, that even Michael Bay couldn't spoil it, or is he really back, as we knew him in the late 90'? Even though there are some of his signature ""over the top"" moments present in the movie, they kinda fit in. The script is a bit thin about the characters, but that lack is compensated by solid acting. The lack of depth is replaced by the authentic emotions on our heroes faces, that makes us care less for their back-stories and concentrate on present efforts.<br/><br/>So overall: it's an impressive directorial work on par with The Rock and Bad Boys(the good one). This movie really made me anticipate for the second TMNT, to see if one of my favourite childhood directors is really back.<br/><br/>10/10"
"quincytheodore","7","1","6","5 April 2016"," Swift suspense in a sporadic setting
","Real life event can be a very compelling material on silver screen, although it has to balance the plausibility and the dramatic interpretation. ""13 Hours"" is not Argo or Black Hawk Down, although it manages to keep the tone in serious manner and also delivering a constant barrage of bullets and intense sequences on the longest night of the participants' lives.<br/><br/>The aim here is to set up a crisis by first introducing the people involved within it. There's ample time to portray these contractors, although it can be a bit too crowded at times. A couple of the subplots rise above the others. Pablo Schreiber as Tanto and David Denman as Boon look more natural, although the majority of cast fit the military visage requirement.<br/><br/>The drama is not all hit, Michael Bay delivers a more constrained direction, leaning towards Pearl Harbor than his Transformers days. It tries to humanize these characters and portrays them as heroes, which they are. However, the attempt feels bland on half the cases, it's the casual army gig and its human spark might not be as strong as the combustible action scenes.<br/><br/>When the movie gets its momentum it doesn't disappoint. The skirmishes are high octane, furthermore it's not sheer random shooting, there's strategy at play here. Each fight feels different with respective field and perimeter. If they are going for the chaotic vibe, it definitely reaches the objective.<br/><br/>""13 Hours"" presents the human dilemma in manageable pace and the warfare in splendid bright flashes."
"brendandevere","7","1","6","6 March 2016"," Bay's Propaganda?
","Michael Bay is known for his high impact action films that burst at the seams with unbridled patriotism. Each paint a picture of sheer superiority for the 'red, white and blue' in its devoted battle against in surmountable odds for the good of mankind and '13 Hours' is no different. Bay's flirtation with a serious event takes time to build but when the temperature rises, so does the death count as bullets fly and explosions deal out maximum destruction. '13 Hours' has all the hallmarks of a sensational night out at the cinema and knowing of its impending release, I was unashamedly excited when the opening scenes flashed up onto the screen.<br/><br/>Michael Bay (Transformers, Armageddon) has been described as on odd kind of bloke, requiring his cast to go about performing unusual tasks in between scene takes and camera shots. Now I don't know if the source to these little rumours are reliable but you can get a feel for a Director's personality through the story he or she is trying to tell. The big question would have to be - Is Michael Bay disguising his production as a form of propaganda considering today's political climate? The Director has been quoted as saying that he wanted to keep the politics out of the film but politics is war and war is politics. '13 Hours' is very much in the mould of another high impact battle film, 'Black Hawk Down', and it is Ridley Scott's war epic that is referenced in Bay's movie. Whereas 'Black Hawk Down' was able to provide the audience with a repenting emotional edge, '13 Hours', although just as sombre, just as disastrous, does at times fail to connect with its targeted audience. This is not to say that Michael Bay's little foray into the world of the modern soldier is not compelling watching. The whole production is extremely well made and it immediately puts the viewer right into the highly intense atmosphere of North Africa. The acting is first class with a cast best suited for the conditions rather than having the temptation of bringing in big names that perhaps would look out of place in such a production where the action is the star of the show. Chuck Hogan's screenplay based on Mitchell Zuckoff's book, is gritty and authentic, fabricating the strained and volatile atmosphere of the situation that is so evident throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Based on a true event, '13 Hours' is set in the North African hotbed of Libya just after the fall of their Military ruler, General Gadaffi. Quite simply, it is the one of the most dangerous places on earth with a hotpot of warring factions trying to claim control of a country on the brink of destruction. America's presence is strong throughout the crumbling cities but intelligently keeping a low profile, hiding their existence from the dangerous warlords and gangs that are rising up from the ashes. Six men, all ex United States Military are employed as special security contractors to expertly 'babysit' diplomats and consular officials in the Libyan city of Benghazi. When the US Ambassador is captured and killed in an American complex the six hired soldiers must defend the remaining personal under their protection. All hell breaks lose as the audience is witness to total warfare in an intense battle that lasts through the night. John Krasinski, James Badge Dale and Pablo Schreiber are three of the actors cast to play these brave men. Not household names but they do all look like professional military men, beefed up to provide imposing figures as they blast the enemy to 'kingdom come'. But they do exactly what they are being paid for, which seems to be a surprise to everybody.<br/><br/>'13 Hours' is great to watch, there is no doubting this and it builds up nicely to a climax that is full throttle action. The film will appeal to any blood thirsty action junkie wanting their adrenalin hit but where it seems to wane is the connection that the characters don't seem to have with the audience. It seems hard at times to really feel anything for the cast, with Bay preferring to focus on the heroic deeds of these contractors. They are heroic if this is indeed what went down on this very violent night but it may be a little too 'Team America' for some viewers."

It is a shame that they chose to politicize this. <br/><br/>The movie is good but long, in many respects just another ""war is hell"" movie. One can probably get all they need by watching the first 45 minutes then the last 15 minutes right before the credits, essentially turning a 145 minute movie into a 60 minute movie.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes sets the stage, showing how dangerous a place Benghazi is, and how the CIA and their contract mercenaries operate. On September 11th, 2012, most in the compound are having a leisurely day, several of them talking back home via Skype with family. Then in the early evening all hell breaks loose as terrorists, angry at the USA, storm the compound. One of the dead was the Ambassador. <br/><br/>This is a very serious act in terms of USA - Libya relations, it is commonly accepted that Ambassadors and their staff are safe, but the Libyan government simply did not have the system in place to protect them. The country quickly apologized and made it clear that terrorists were responsible.<br/><br/>The last 15 minutes shows the fighting ending and the evacuation of the survivors and the dead. Again, war is hell, no matter if it is against a country or against terrorists."

","Michael Bay needs to stop making Transformers films. Pearl Harbor was definitely a mess at times, but it's films like 13 Hours that Bay should focus on. You can tell how passionate Bay is for these stories and our heroes overseas. There is still plenty of Bay-isms throughout 13 Hours, but for the most part, it's a well made film with more heart and emotion than any of his last handful of films combined.<br/><br/>An important difference between this film and other Bay films is that it feels like he left all of the script duties to other people. There aren't any gratuitous shots of women and there were minimal slow motion action shots. Granted, some of those slow motion shots were substituted for the highly overused hand-held camera work, otherwise known as 'shaky cam'. Seriously Hollywood, can we stop that? But Bay pulled back on the action and created a really scary and realistic world in Libya. <br/><br/>This tells the story of the Benghazi soldiers who were thrust into helping an entire undercover base when chaos ensues. An important thing Bay does is create an atmosphere that is clearly layered with people who don't understand what's going on and why it's happening. It's those choices by Bay that give the film its depth in its quieter moments. Yep, Bay actually developed his characters relatively well, something those Transformers films never really accomplished.<br/><br/>The film does however try to pull on your heartstrings a little too much at times, including showing all of the soldiers at the same time contacting their families and friends a mere day before the attacks. A little more subtly would have helped, Bay. With that said, you absolutely end up caring about the characters involved in these attacks, and Bay even shows the Libyans who helped the U.S. when our 'friendlies' weren't available, a nice touch for a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>Another complaint I had was that sometimes the tone of the film shifts from being darkly serious to a little too playful when characters start cracking a few jokes during intense battle sequences. I would have liked a little more consistency.<br/><br/>A character describes the events of the film towards the end as 'feeling like he's in a horror film'. I can't disagree with him. There were moments of tension and terror of 13 Hours that surpassed some horror films of the past few years, that can also be contributed to Bay's work. Last but not least, I'd like to give a shout-out to Lorne Balfe who composed the music. The score complemented the film well, especially in its most heartfelt and heartbreaking moments. A job well done Bay and crew, 13 Hours is a solid film.<br/><br/>+Well developed story and characters<br/><br/>+Incredible score<br/><br/>+Tension and horrifying moments<br/><br/>-A little more subtly in big moments would have been nice<br/><br/>-Tone shifts a bit here and there<br/><br/>-Shaky cam<br/><br/>7.0/10"

"Prismark10","5","1","12","23 September 2018"," The emotional manipulation leaves a bad taste
","I like to think Michael Bay has a good film in him that would get him critical acclaim. Pain & Gain was a step in the right direction. 13 Hours is not that film. At times I was left open mouthed with the appalling dialogue coming out of the various actors mouths.<br/><br/>Jack Silva (John Krasinski) and best friend Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) are highly paid private security contractors for a secret CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. Both are experienced men who have worked in war zones.<br/><br/>Benghazi is regarded as the wild west where you cannot tell the difference between a friendly faction and an enemy faction. The station chief does not want the contractors to engage in any shootout in case it leads to further problems and negative media coverage.<br/><br/>When Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives at the Embassy compound, the contractors are concerned with the light security. Their concerns are dismissed. When the embassy comes under attack, Silva, Woods and the others belated go and try and rescue the ambassador. They later try to hold off the militia. Any outside help seems to be slow in arriving.<br/><br/>Bay has no problems with the action sequences. He also has no problems trying to manipulate the audience emotionally. Bay keeps it simple, the bad guys are the weasel pen pushers working for the State Department or the Defence Department. The contractors are virtuous, heroic. Hold on, aren't they basically highly paid mercenaries? Who knows, they are thinly characterised in this film and I could barely tell them apart.<br/><br/>Strangely, Bay never specifically blames Obama or Hillary Clinton for the fiasco; yet his film shows that Benghazi was an absolute mess. Why does he pull his punches and not blame the people at the top? Probably in order to make the film, Bay had to manipulate the truth!"

","This was a fine piece of imperialist, militarist propaganda masquerading as ""truth"".<br/><br/>The truth claim is repeated over and over again in the blu-ray extras, as well as in the opening titles of the movies itself: ""This is a true story""<br/><br/>Just 15 seconds before this claim, the opening titles also claimed that ""The CIA watched for lethal weapons before they spread to the global black market""<br/><br/>Two years before this movie premiered Seymour Hersh published an article, ""The Red Line and the Rat Line"", in London Review of Books which revealed that the purpose of the consular annex was the exact opposite of what the movie claims. The consulate's only mission was to provide cover for the moving of arms. The so-called ""rat line"" was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the opposition (to Assad). Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida.<br/><br/>So right off the bat I knew that the ""truth"" claim was to be taken with an enormous grain of salt.<br/><br/>The blu-ray extras also hail Bay's aim for realism. As one actor claimed, ""His attention to detail is unbelievable, and he's committed to doing it properly"". Then we see Bay gingerly trimming the cuts on Pablo Schreiber's clothes with a small scissors. Of course, the extras also point out the military training the actors had to go through, all in the name of realism.<br/><br/>And then Michael Bay hires an actor with the strongest Iranian accent imaginable, who obviously doesn't speak a word of Arabic, to play the Arabic interpreter Amahl. That's some attention to detail you got there, Mike. Couldn't find a single Arabic speaking actor (who, importantly,can also master the distinct Libyan Maghrebi dialect anywhere? Or perhaps realism is only interesting when it has to do with the military and guns, as per usual in Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>And of course, since the movie is blatant propaganda, no one questions with a single word the very existence of a secret base with armed military personnel, who apparently have enough arms to fight a smaller civil war. Actually, the only one who makes sense in this whole movie is the appointed villain, the milquetoast, pudgy and balding CIA chief (in contrast to the buff military guys who Bay carefully show off shirtless and glistening with sweat) who points out that they have no jurisdiction and aren't even officially there. Of course, the other characters and the movie itself tell him to go frak himself, the stormtroopers of the empire can do as they damn well please! And of course, the blu-extras contain the usual circle jerk with people in the production tripping over each other in a competition to see who can praise the military the most.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is great, especially the cinematography. However, the lack of continuity where we can cut from night, to daylight, to dusk, to night again between shots is a further indication of the level of attention to detail this movie pays.<br/><br/>Bay is a great director of action spectacle, but he has never been able to master character moments. Those parts of the movie, especially the scenes where Krasinski's character is speaking with his family, are about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. Krasinski turned out to be a great director with ""A Quiet Place"", but he has never been much of an actor, and this movie is not an exception.<br/><br/>If this movie had just presented itself as an action flick, that would have been fine. But the ""truth"" claim killed it."

","13 Hours.<br/><br/>Say what you will about Michael Bay and those terrible 'Transformers' sequels but this Director sure knows how to direct excellent action scenes.
'13 Hours' is in my opinion his best movie offering.
Bay's earlier films such as 'Bad boys' and 'The Rock' offered flashes of brilliance but '13 Hours' is of a much high calibre.
Based on a true story set in Benghazi 2012.
A group of ex-military contractors are providing security for an unofficial CIA base when The US Ambassador staying in the vicinity comes under attack by armed locals.
The six Contractors go to the Ambassadors aid only to end up fighting for their lives.
This is a thrilling action packed movie that is perfect for Director Michael Bay's style.
Once the action starts it is relentless with scene after scene of technical brilliance.
As aforementioned Bay is at best when directing action. The script Is tightly penned and offers none of Bay's usual grass and juvenile humour.
This film is focused and all the more brilliant for it.<br/><br/>For Home Cinema fans this is a must own movie on 4K Blu-ray.
The image quality is of reference quality.
This is 4K eye candy with a grainless digital image that is one of the crispiest movies to grace my Blu-ray player.
HDR is sublime with rich deep blacks and eye popping colours. Detail is fine with hair and grime visible on war torn faces.
Michael Bay often uses very warm filters on his camera and this film shows the Libyan heat to dramatic effect.
Sunlight is blinding and explosions will sear the retina.
This movie is definitely in my top 5 for image quality on 4K Blu-ray.<br/><br/>Sound is equally impressive if not even better. The Dolby Atmos sound mix is violent and offers a good workout for any dedicated Home Cinema system.
This film will sort out the wheat from the chaff in terms of a good audio system.
Bass is brutal. Gun shots have real punch and explosions will crack the plaster in your living room.
Height and surround effects are constant and precise offering true immersion.
Front sound stage is wide and aggressive with plenty of nuances to tantalise the ear.
This again easily a 4K disc in my top 5 regarding sound quality.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the war movie genre and appreciate well filmed action scenes then this movie is definitely for you.
If also you love great image and audio quality then this is a movie well worth shelling out your hard earned cash for."

Despite all this fantastic fast-paced action, though, the film itself does seem to drag, and I just didn't find it compelling enough. Maybe because the film was overlong. They should have cut it with about 20-30 minutes. At times it felt more like a video game, distancing me from the reality of the action. And why do they insist on constantly showing the time? What did it matter? Its not as if there were a deadline, and what did it matter whether it was 12:19 or 12:20? The repetitive dialogue was also an issue for me.

","Nothing better than a movie based on a true story. Certainly when it is about a delicate subject as this one. I'm not going to debate on the necessity of the USA being at war forever since they exist because that is a pointless debate since almost the whole economy of the USA turns around war. Oil and weapons are the major incomes so they will continue going to war with the countries they can see benefits coming from. And no it's not about ending dictatorship or stopping terrorists, they couldn't care less about those things. There are enough dictators and human disasters in Africa where you don't see anybody doing something about it because there is nothing to gain from. 13 Hours though, is a strong movie about a handful of soldiers left alone in the middle of a hostile territory, because there is basically nothing to gain from. It's a poignant story showing the soldiers doing anything they can to save some American civilians. The acting is very good. The action and combat scenes look all very realistic.

","13 Hours is a fun and intense watching adventure. While starting slow, the sometimes unexpected action keeps you engrossed into the movie, allowing there to be breathing time between action scenes, so you're not completely bombarded by action 'till the very end.<br/><br/>There are definitely emotional and gripping moments, with the six main protagonists going up against hordes of enemies that are attacking at their assigned base in Benghazi. The movie feels realistic, and is a great representation of the book and of what happened in real life, as this movie is based off of a true story. Some people have bias against certain directors, especially Michael Bay, which is fine. Some still need to give credit where credit is due, as this movie grips onto you and keeps you along for the ride.<br/><br/>While the action sections are very impressive and a blast to watch, there is no real emotional bond that can be seen between the protagonists. Sure, they're forced to be there for several weeks, working alongside each other, but the only real connection they ever share is by some occasional banter. Plenty of characters are introduced that don't play an impact into the movie, making some scenes feel contrived and unnecessary. A majority of those aren't even named or introduced, which is fine, as not every single person can be significant to the story. Although, having some more details about some of those people would keep the audience attached some more.<br/><br/>All around, the movie definitely has its slip-ups, but it does well when it comes to keeping the audience invested. Some scenes will definitely keep you on your toes, leaning towards the screen as you anticipate what may happen next. 13 Hours is definitely recommended, and the ending wraps it up well."

I'm not sure what that is, other than of the six contracted security agents who did what they've been trained to do with honor and GI Joe bravado.<br/><br/>Reducing the Benghazi story to 13 hours doesn't tell the whole story, as we all know and not taking a stand on the issue reduces 13 hours to an experience devoid of meaning for this viewer."

","Six security guards struggle to protect the American Ambassador to Libya when his compound is attacked in this true story action thriller. '13 Hours' gets off to a strong start with the latest security recruit's car stopped by local militants in an intense, tone setting scene. As the film subsequently introduces each character in depth, '13 Hours' exhibits all the promise of a war movie with a difference. As soon the compound attack occurs though, this potential goes out the window with gunfire and explosions so rapid and nonstop that it is easy to lose track of what is happening. The action does pause at one point with one security guard ruefully stating that ""downtime is the worst"" since it forces you to think about your loved ones and contemplate whether you are fighting for a country you care nothing about - but such thoughtful dialogue exchanges are sadly few and far between with the explosive action resuming shortly afterwards. The action sequences are at least well crafted and Dion Beebe does a great job allowing most of the action to be visible despite nighttime conditions. It is also hard to resent the film's Best Sound Oscar nomination even if campaign violations may have led to the nomination. Overall, this is a decent movie and if not a total success, it is a refreshing attempt from Michael Bay to add some meat to the high octane action stuff he is best known for."
"CarmaChan","7","0","1","19 April 2017"," Benghazi Simplified
","I am giving this movie only 7 out of 10 stars because I think the producers and writers did not go far enough to clarify why more help did not come. It is nice to see the humanity and heroism of some of the people who were there when the ambassador was attacked. It was informative to see how it unfolded according to those who were on the ground, assuming the storytellers were true to their accounts and their accounts were objective. To be objective means you have to recognize that you don't know what you don't know and you might be wrong about what you think you know. <br/><br/>So it was an interesting movie to watch, a sad story, a mess, maybe a stupid mess, but every person who was there had a choice whether or not to be there. Personally, I don't understand why any sane person goes to the Middle East. If you choose to put yourself in the middle of that mess, don't expect me to sympathize or cheer when you survive their tribal egomania. <br/><br/>The Middle East is a lost cause, that's what this film confirms. It reminds us that outsiders don't belong there. It shows us why it was a mistake to get involved in their tribal conflicts. We have better things to do - there are many places in this world where the majority of the people and the governments want our help and we do not give them our help - that is the question. Why wasn't there better security for this small group of Americans who shouldn't have gone there in the first place? That's someone else's question, not mine. My question is why are we in the Middle East at all? Why aren't we ""helping"" Africa and/or South America? Why aren't we helping the governments and people who have real problems and who want our help to become more civilized? Why is that conflict - in that region between those tribes who have hated each other for thousands of years - why is that conflict worthy of the sacrifice of our sons and their children? <br/><br/>Yes, the people who were there and were faced with aggression and certain death were remarkable in their struggle to survive.

","There has been allot of buzz about this film since it has come out especially considering Michael Bay directed this film and I did enjoy this film though probably not as much as the majority of people did. The premise of this film sees six CIA soldiers having to defend a US embassy from terrorists in Benghazi. John Krasinski plays the lead soldier in this film and I thought he did a really good job, he added depth to his character and gave a powerful performance that managed to rise up his character's clichÃ© story arcs. The rest of the cast does a pretty decent job in this film to add emotional weight to the film., but unfortunately there characters just aren't very interesting and so when the action takes place you don't really care too much about these characters which is a big detriment to the film. The story of this film is pretty intense when the action takes place as you see these guys fighting for there lives against massive odds and it is intense to see. However, the first hour of this film takes allot to get going and you don't really care about the characters as none of the action is taking place. The script in this film has some decent dramatic dialogue and some decent banter between the soldiers in this film. But that traditional Michael Bay awkward humour does take place and it does hurt when it is there but it is nowhere near as bad as the Transformers films. The style of this film when the action is taking place it is great and you are with the characters as they are in this dire situation. However, as mentioned before the first hour of this film is just too slow and mundane for me and the pacing of it just doesn't work for me and really hurt this film. Credit should go to Michael Bay though for at least attempting to make a serious film and doing a pretty decent job with it.

","Libya, 2012. At an unofficial CIA base in Benghazi a group of ex- military contractors are providing security. In the aftermath of Gaddafi's downfall a power vacuum exists and the climate is volatile. Military weapons are freely available. The US Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, makes a visit to the area, staying in a compound near the CIA base. On the night of 11 September, 2012, the Ambassador's compound is attacked by hordes of heavily armed locals. The only forces willing and able to defend it are six CIA contractors.<br/><br/>Before seeing it, I was very skeptical about this movie. It clearly starts at a disadvantage, being directed by Michael Bay, he of the explosion-centric, all style no substance plots. Plus the timing seemed very suspicious, being released in a US election year, with Hillary Clinton running for President and the Benghazi attack being a controversial mark on her record as Secretary of State. So the movie seemed to have a political agenda.<br/><br/>Thankfully my fears were unfounded and the movie is surprisingly good and apolitical. Well told, with a good build up, giving the main characters some depth and setting the scene well. When the action starts it is not all unrealistic heroics but fairly plausible battle scenes. There is a degree of overuse of pyrotechnics by Michael Bay, but it wouldn't be a Michael Bay movie without it.<br/><br/>Quite compelling viewing, from a point, as the battle gets tenser and tenser and the odds greater.<br/><br/>Solid performances too.<br/><br/>Easily the best Michael Bay movie, though not that this says much."

I gave this movie a 9 because at least it shows how our Sec. of State allowed them to die so painfully. They all died form bullets from eh enemy. Except Sevens who died from monster Islams."

","Did Michael Bays have no control over the audio balance between the dialog and the background music? I never write reviews but this problem blew me away! We tried everything to hear the dialog but to no avail. It's too bad because the movie was great. It had great Michael Bays visuals, which he does very well, but the sound???<br/><br/>Over all it was a great movie. I would recommend it to a person that liked action movies. I'm not really an action movie person. I did enjoy the drama. Michael has done so many movies Pearl Harbor, Pain and Gain, The Rock and Transformers. I wish this movie would have held up. <br/><br/>The visuals of of 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi were wonderful. I felt like I was really there. I wanted to here the dialog that was going on in the background even though it would have been impossible to interpret. Once again the music was too loud."
"Genti22","7","0","4","20 July 2016"," Michael Bay at his best.
","13 hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a biographical war film directed by Michael Bay and written by Chuck Hogan. It stars James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, Max Martini, Pablo Schreiber, and Toby Stephens on the main roles. Based on a true story, the film follows six members of a security team who fight to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya after waves of terrorist attacks on September 11, 2012. The directing in this movie is really good, and for that I have to credit Michael Bay, because even though he has made some not-so-good movies in the recent years, I knew he had talent and he certainly shows it in this one. The cinematography is also great by Dion Beebe, but what stands out to me the most is the score composed by Lorne Balfe. It brought up the emotions when needed to and it made us feel for these people a lot throughout. The acting is superb all around, but the two shinning stars are James Badge Dale and especially John Krasinski, who had to play out most of the emotional scenes and he pulled out like a pro. The movie has caused some controversy since it is based on a true story that happened back in 2012, but the politic elements are smartly not touched upon on this movie as we are really just seeing the movie from these six guy's eyes. They do not know what is happening yet they have the courage to take some action and actually save lives. It did start to feel like it is a bit too long by the end, and it does have some shaky cam here and there, but really those are the only negatives that I found. In my opinion this is a very well made movie, and definitely one of, if not the, best Bay film ever ."

","This movie seemed very similar to ""Lone Survivor"" in feel and composition. Both were based on real events, and both came across as good versus evil. Good were the Western contractors, and bad were the AK and rocket launcher carrying guys dressed up in traditional Middle eastern outfits.<br/><br/>It was interesting to read that the two main areas - the CIA compound and the US Embassy had been constructed using the real plans for these buildings.<br/><br/>Although deeper meanings are meant to be conveyed, this movie is basically an action film. It succeeds very well in showing the confusion faced by the security team on the ground of working out who the bad guys were - especially at the embassy.<br/><br/>Towards the end, as the team fight off waves of Middle Eastern dressed enemy, who run at the compound, in the open, it reminds you very much of the movie Zulu. Except the brave Zulu warriors running into the hail of bullets have been replaced by more Middle Eastern dressed, terrorist looking types.<br/><br/>This is a very good action movie which provides an insight into the dreadful events that took place that night in Libya."
"Sankari_Suomi","8","0","7","6 June 2016"," The secret story of Obama's heroes!
","Michael Bay is famous for his superbly accurate war films, and this documentary style retelling of the Benghazi siege will go down in history as the finest work he ever produced.<br/><br/>The story is as follows...<br/><br/>US Ambassador Chris Stevens was sent to Libya, which is where the Muslims come from. He did whatever ambassadors do, and apparently did it well. <br/><br/>Concerns were raised about poor security at the consulate and the nearby CIA outpost due to years of neglect under George Bush. Barack Obama's repeated attempts to improve defences at both sites were constantly blocked in the Senate by hostile Republicans, who claimed it was a waste of money at a time when the USA should be completely withdrawing from Libya.<br/><br/>In the second week of September 2012, CIA agents noticed that the Muslims were even more angry and unpleasant than usual for that time of year. The head of the CIA compound was in a chronic state of denial, refusing to believe what his eyes and ears were clearly telling him.<br/><br/>Minutes before the consulate came under attack, its security detail—a bunch of poorly trained Muslims with a random assortment of firearms—fled into the night like bitches on heat. Moments later, the consulate was crawling with Muslims. There were hundreds, possibly thousands of them. Some say millions. Muslims always move in large numbers.<br/><br/>The consulate contacted the CIA compound for help. A crack team of CIA guys (known today as 'Obama's Heroes') volunteered to rescue Stevens and his bodyguards, but the CIA chief refused to let them go. (In the film he repeatedly orders them to 'stand down' on his own authority. Eventually he contacts the White House to inform POTUS, by which time the consulate is on fire).<br/><br/>The White House tried everything they could to send help, but their strongest forces were too far away to reach the scene in time, and the cowardly CIA chief refused to deploy his own men.<br/><br/>The Muslims tore the consulate apart in a furious search for the Americans, screaming and chattering in that language they speak, which sounds like a donkey fellating a camel. Chris Stevens took shelter in a safe room with his bodyguards, but they were eventually smoked out by the Muslims. <br/><br/>Stumbling through smoke filled rooms, Stevens was separated from the others and later died in hospital from smoke inhalation. His bodyguards were massacred by the Muslims.<br/><br/>Under intense pressure from Obama and Clinton, the CIA chief finally agreed to let his super-troops attack the Muslims. Sadly they arrived too late to save their fellow Americans, but they did manage to escape with a bunch of old typewriters and other secret consulate stuff, which they successfully saved from the Muslims.<br/><br/>The CIA troops battled their way back to the CIA compound, fighting off hordes of screaming Muslims in every street. The Muslims switched their attention from the consulate to the compound and hit it with every kind of Muslim weapon imaginable (e.g. AK47s, RPGs, mortars, etc.) The CIA troops fought back, killing many Muslims. This went on for 13 hours (hence the title of the film).<br/><br/>By dawn the compound was littered with bullet cases, dirt, debris, and the corpses of Muslims. Some Americans had died as well. Humiliated, the few remaining Muslims ran away.<br/><br/>Another bunch of Muslims arrived; but these were good ones, imported from Tripoli. They had been trained to defend Americans, and successfully rescued the survivors at the CIA compound. Everyone went home, including the rogue CIA chief who had issued the 'stand down' order in defiance of his government.<br/><br/>It was a good film. I learned a lot about the Muslims.<br/><br/>I rate 13 Hours at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a magnificent 8/10 on IMDb."

","After reading the reviews of the movie I was really excited to watch it but quickly became very disappointed. I'm not going to pretend I know anything about the real story because I don't but the thing that annoyed me was the childishness of the characters, and the amount of clichés, silly one liners, and stereotypical "" American are great and superior"" moment there are in the film. <br/><br/>As always Americans are the victims, and they're great and superior to anyone. All the security team are laid back Giants , drinking bud, playing video games , while the enemy are all scrawny thugs.<br/><br/>The movie just didn't seem to have a direction, I didn't know where I was upto watching at times , much of it just felt like I was watching a friend play call of duty. The dialogue was bad , the characters were bad , and what's with this poor artificial lighting that bay used, it just looks stupid and is quite clearly fake. <br/><br/>The only reason I have it 5 is because some of the scenery and locations looked good, so some research might have actually been done there , but other than that it was just a typical film gloryfying Americans, with annoying characters showing us how great their life is back home yet how their not scared."

","OK First off, amazing film loved every moment but 1 scene caught my eye which lowered my rating because at one point you can see them playing a Call of Duty game. Team Deathmatch on the map instinct which was released in the call of duty game Advanced Warfare. Released on November 4th 2014. If this movie was set in 2012 then this is a obvious movie mistake, but the film was great that action was good (no surprise Michael Bay directed it) and the concept of this being a true story blows my mind.I Give a overall rating of 8 because of that one issue i have with the game being released in 2014 but being shown in a movie said to be set in 2012."

","From a political standpoint, it was a great movie. It had all the elements for riveting drama and entertainment. I was on the edge of my seat rooting for the good guys. The acting was impressive as well as the effects, directing, lighting etc.. What I most wanted to point out, and is a pet peeve of mine, is the incredible amount of weapons fire. Millions of rounds fired and only a handful were actually killed! Other than that rant, I liked it. That's all I wanted to say, but Amazon demands 10 lines for some idiotic reason Now I have to add filler, as so many people do. So here we go with the filler 4 lines of wasted rubbish. I miss the old owners of IMDb. Too many fake reviews now."

"scottshak_111","7","0","5","30 March 2016"," Bland but high on action
","13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is without focus, a little bland but high on action! Michael Bay is back at it again. His favourite pastime – Explosions, bullets, fire, and shaky cameras! So, with a head full of kabooms he walks in with a true story that promises goosebumps by its plot. But the question is, is he able to deliver? As the movie progresses, there are unfulfilled instances deliberately left at weird junctures. These don't come to fruition and you are often left with a sour taste wondering things might be related, and that they might get taken up. But No! Bay plays with your adrenaline like a bad DJ, and chops off frames when you don't see anything coming. You wish there was a proper tension shown with time to bide by, but the editing is really poor to have given it a thought.<br/><br/>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi doesn't let you focus. It keeps storming through frames that you soon become indifferent toward. The first half goes on like that; the second half suddenly goes for a change of tactics. You are hosed up with focus out of the blue and suddenly people start talking with time in their hands. Then you realize the movie has slowed down awkwardly and is trying to bring home the feels. You are fed some drama that basically tries to pass on with its bad screenplay, like two people having a conversation when facing the dilemma of death. So, basically a cliché that every soldier movie carries.<br/><br/>But then the action comes to the rescue and you are suddenly woken up again. There are some brilliant shots taken, some exquisite slo-mo explosions in the backdrop that extrapolates the work Michael Bay puts in. Isn't that his favorite job? Bullets fire like lasers which are downright appalling and thrilling to watch. Headshots, grenades and mortars they add up to the bucket of some cool violent action, that will hurl you back home as if you were playing Call of Duty unperturbed.<br/><br/>So the key players play the cool fiddle, and are witty with their talks. They try to engage you in a little laugh hither and thither, and keep you riveted to a bland setup that has nothing much to offer. But then we are rushed in to the key plot, the one Bay milks properly, and the cow starts to moo! The holed up soldiers and a world of haters are basically it.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Watch out for one cool kill wherein a guy with a rocket launcher gets hit and friendly fires on the ground. Also, there were some pretty dope sniper kills that will reset your mood.<br/><br/>What miffs you is the fact with all the chaos mortar annihilation brings in, they suddenly stop out of the blue, which was totally uncalled for. It would make you think that either the guys ran out of shells, or they decided to stop with just 3-4 shots. But the Bay-head will tell you that he decided to focus on the damage done rather than depicting what was happening in the enemy territory, which again raises some serious questions to the direction enclave.<br/><br/>The movie ends up paying tribute to the real people who were entailed in such a covert scenario, which lets you pay heed. 13 Hours is slightly above the average meter owing to that quotient and the fact that it manages to hang things through eventually."
