"nyvajiwk","Null","76","108","24 November 2017"," Very Bad (But not Disappointing)
","I really enjoy the Star Trek TV series (original, TNG and DS9) and admit that I am late to this review. As much as I enjoy Star Trek and its ideals I had watched Star Wars The Force Awakens by JJ Abrams and I hated that. Star Wars rebooted with completely non-plot for pre-teens and one-liners, wise-cracks and plot holes so big that even Donald Trump's ego could drive through them was not for me.<br/><br/>So, anyway with a certain amount of hesitation I finally watched the reboot of Star Trek.... and it was as bad as I feared. Since it was expected I was not disappointed, but by gosh what is with the people who hire the director JJ Abrams? He makes every character a cartoon character. Never mind that the utopian and progressive society of the Federation is completely glossed over and ignored, but these characters with the formulaic backgrounds and corny lines and false tensions is just terrible. The Vulcans and Romulans' feud has never been as cliché-ridden I would say.<br/><br/>Look, I get it. People pay for reboots and remakes and sequels and so Hollywood serves them up (or is it the other way around?), but use some imagination, have one novel or original idea at least. I am too old for cartoons... which explains why I won't be watching the next Star Trek or fifteen Star Wars coming out. Obviously the director JJ Abrams is specialized in reboots and remakes and sequels and not original ideas."

","Star Trek. When someone speaks this name, various images, ideas, characters and phrases come to mind. I know they certainly do with me. Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like ""Live long and Prosper"", ""Good God Jim, I'm a doctor not a."". I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.<br/><br/>To my great delight, I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams re-imaging of ""Star Trek"". I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them, even in younger iterations, because most people think of the characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately, my doubts were unnecessary.<br/><br/>This is not your father's ""Star Trek"". From the moment the movie begins, so does the action and it never lets up. However, this movie has more than just incredible and intense action, it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure, they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century, but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However, you don't need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There's a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.<br/><br/>But, what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, aka ""Bones"". This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections, mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine, however, takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer, lover, and captain that you already know, but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger, bravado, intelligence, and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.<br/><br/>They have laid a solid foundation for a new series, with new life, perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good, my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.<br/><br/>This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews. I intentionally didn't reveal any plot points so as to not spoil anything for whoever may read this. I may in the future reveal areas that may have spoilers but mark these sections so you can skip over them. I'll be seeing Wolverine tomorrow and hope to have a review up by tomorrow night. Until we meet again, ""Live long and Prosper!"""

","Disappointing goofball action comedy<br/><br/>This is a goofball Mission Impossible comedy, that contains highly campy and pantomime so-called villains, endless cheesy jokes and one-liners at the expense of any actual Star Trek ideals.
I personally do not like it and think it is a step in the wrong direction."
"jmiller2032","3","372","585","11 May 2009"," The plot makes no sense whatsoever. (SPOILER ALERT)
","I'm not going to hit this from a scientific perspective. That would be too easy and would just invite others to castigate me for not ""suspending disbelief"" during a fun summer sci-fi. No, this movie sucks on a very base level. The first, and most disturbing part of the movie is the villain, Nero, who I think is the worst villain Hollywood has given us, and Hollywood once gave us Arnold as Ice Man. Nero is awful because his motivation makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>As the story goes, Nero is furious at Spock, and by extension his whole race of Vulcans, because Spock did not get to Romulus' star in time to save it from super nova, which destroyed his planet and all those he loved and cared for. In the process both he and Spock are sucked into a black hole and spit out the other side well in the past, except at different times, Nero 25 years before Spock. In waiting 25 years for Spock to come through the black hole as he had, Nero and his crew seethe with rage and plot their revenge against Spock and his evil race of Vulcans.<br/><br/>But why? Did Spock create the super nova? No. That was explained as a natural disaster. Did Spock try to save his planet? Yes. In fact, he had every reason to believe that he was going to die in the process. After failing to stave off the super nova, he was sucked into a black hole, which is assumed to destroy anything entering it (after all, black holes literally crush atoms to the point of not existing). Personally I think that makes Spock a hero to the Romulans! Having a vendetta against Spock and the Vulcans would be like tracking down and killing the family of a fire fighter who died in your house while he tried to save your wife and kids. That makes no sense. None. Last, Nero is now in the past, no? Why doesn't he just go about saving his planet from destruction? He's got the ""red matter"" to do it.<br/><br/>The other thing that ticked me off was the silly string of ""accidents"" that put a gang of 22 year-olds in command of the Federation's flagship. Do they not have even a single 40 year-old who has actually been in space before? It's even worse than that if you think about it. Before the ship takes off Kirk is about to be booted out of Starfleet—but now he's put in charge?<br/><br/>I'm willing to suspend disbelief in sci-fi movie, but there's a difference between suspending disbelief and watching a movie like I'm a 3-year old. 3 stars out of 10."
"G-Headon","1","186","285","15 May 2009"," JJ Abrams' Space Wars
","Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek is a tale of diplomacy and peace littered with ethical and moral dilemmas developed to make you think, to wonder about what future humanity is moving towards.<br/><br/>This was not Star Trek and it infuriates me that they would try to pass it off as such.<br/><br/>Why couldn't they simply make up new names for the characters or at least give the film a subtitle instead of allowing JJ Abrams to prove his arrogance and ignorance to the real themes behind the Star Trek name? Unnecessary is the most accurate word to describe this film, with its paper thin plot and cardboard cut-out characters. But I realize that is what makes a summer blockbuster these days: big explosions, juvenile humor, and the standard ""bad guy must die"" scenario.<br/><br/>Young Kirk listening to the Beastie Boys and talking on his Nokia phone??? Give me a break, give me The Undiscovered Country any day. At least that film had a message beyond trying to sell me merchandise.<br/><br/>And why did Sulu have a katana if he was an expert in fencing??? Wouldn't it make more sense for him to use a rapier since a katana would be useless with a fencing background? I heard George Takei - in the original series - refused to use a katana because he thought it was too racist and that was why they made Sulu a fencing expert in the first place.<br/><br/>Though I think the most annoying thing about the film - for me - was the cinematography. Even if I ignored how little this movie cared about the substance of the original series or any subsequent Star Trek series, it was still a terrible film. Constant close-ups and a shaky camera anytime the screen isn't completely CG does not substitute for cinematography, it's just lazy film making.<br/><br/>I don't understand why this film needed to be made. JJ Abrams is not a director, he is my childhood's rapist.<br/><br/>Oh and watch for Abrams' Cloverfield monster to make a nice appearance on the ice planet Hoth, I guess that's one creature I can check off my ""Where are they now?"" list."

","No spoilers here. I just want to say that this movie is, to put it nicely, horrendous. I don't really have much to say other than it is a complete waste of time. For me, this was written for a six to twelve year old audience. However, due to the level of violence, it has been rated outside of the audience I think this is aimed at. A lot of things were coincidental... unreal, and just plain silly. The writers need to work towards a much more mature and much more intelligent audience. This was very disappointing for me."
"mgregory-9","1","211","326","11 May 2009"," Wobbly camera strikes again
","After the recently terrible James Bond film, and the equally terrible ending to the Bourne trilogy, it appears that the ""wobbly camera"" disease has spread to another franchise with similar results. There appears to be a direct correlation between the rate of camera wobble and the ""pace"" of the action scene being shot. We all know that this camera wobble is artificial and often done during editing and special effect overlay, but the outcome is the same and it is unwatchable. It appears to me to be a ""technique"" used today in many films to prevent the audience clearly seeing the shot, the special effects and the action occurring. Possibly because the audience would see mismatches between the special effects, the action being overlaid and the poor quality stunt work. I gave this film a rating of one out of ten principally because the wobbly camera technique is something we now see in many films, particularly films with large amounts of special effects and it is cheating the audience out of the opportunity to see if the shot actually flows and to observe how the special effects are melded to the shot and the action. Do we really want to come away from every film thinking we have been in a small boat in a rough swell? I certainly don't and I now add JJ Abrams to the list of Marc Forster who created the worst Bond film of all time with ""jiggle camera"" and Paul Greengrass who destroyed the Bourne Trilogy with ""shaky camera"". Hang your head in shame, this trio had the opportunity to make great films, each carrying their franchise forward and each in turn has been unable to achieve an outcome without the use of ""shaky camera"", which is an automatic turnoff for the audience."
"robnels2000","1","278","435","9 May 2009"," Is this a Joke??
","A true disappointment<br/><br/>I had large reservations about this movie that only became larger as the previews gave more details. I am in no way a Trekkie and I have found my share of flaws in the Star Trek movies and TV shows, but even I couldn't stand the errors in this movie.<br/><br/>To me it was like a cross between Galaxy Quest and Starship Troopers. <br/><br/>And what star was going supernova and endangering the whole galaxy? It would have to have been enormous millions of times larger than any star we can see to directly threaten any worlds outside its own system let alone the whole galaxy. You don't need a degree in stellar physics to know that. We have seen the effects of several stars that have gone supernova in our galaxy and in nearby galaxies and none have been anywhere near that big.<br/><br/>None of the actors had the character they were playing right and Chris Pine seemed to think the role of Kirk was nothing but a joke, Kirk was cavalier but just plain stupid was not part of the character, he wouldn't get a job as dish washer let alone ship's captain. Scotty was nothing like in the TV shows or movies; He had little or no technical abilities and was just the joke of the scenes he was in.<br/><br/>The only character I think they had right was Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy; Karl Urban had it perfect right down to the insults and paranoia.<br/><br/>This was more like a Star Trek parody than anything else. Did Abrams ever watch any of the Star Trek shows or movies, I haven't been this disappointed by a Star Trek movie since Star Trek the Motion Picture."

","I'll admit I am not a trekkie. I saw the movie because the trailer looked interesting. I want my 10 bucks back.<br/><br/>In a sentence, this movie was idiotic eye candy. Strong, meaningless emotions were intermingled with fancy special effects and a nonsense plot. If you want to see the movie because of the trailer, stick with the trailer; it's all the content you get. Anyone that says this movie was good wasn't paying attention at all. The target demographic of this movie must have been toddlers.<br/><br/>They quickly rushed between scenes ignoring any relevance to, or continuity of, the plot. Characters made bold speeches and impassioned decisions that were either meaningless or simply defied in the next ten seconds. Characters also blatantly threw out their catch lines every chance they got to speak. I got a sense this movie wasn't geared toward trekkies but to people who just knew the catch lines. Awful.<br/><br/>I back up what I say; here's a list..<br/><br/>(spoilers)<br/><br/>-The first scene where the young kirk threw a car off a cliff had nothing to do with anything.. at all.<br/><br/>-The plot was free of any logic. Romulus's planet is destroyed. Why didn't they evacuate? Why was one man (spoc) charged with billions of lives? How did a miner find a way back in time? If it was common knowledge why didn't everyone just go back in time to destroy the supernova? Why didn't he just save his planet when he got to the past? Obviously even if he destroys the federation and the vulcans the supernova will still destroy his planet. And how the hell did he go back in time? Oh he got sucked into a black hole. Just like the one he put in the center of the vulcan planet? Just like the one that destroyed him at the end? Why didn't they all just go back in time at the end and save EVERYONE??<br/><br/>-If you really payed attention, few scenes actually made sense with regard to where they were and what they were doing.<br/><br/>-Kirk makes spock beat his face in and then becomes captain. Spock has a severe emotional breakdown and they're best friends in less than two minutes.<br/><br/>-You don't have to drill to destroy a planet with a black hole. A planet wouldn't be around for minutes if it had a black hole at it's center. At the end they create a black whole with like 10000 times the red matter as before right next to earth.<br/><br/>-Romulus could kill kirk at one point but just doesn't.. for no real reason..<br/><br/>-At some points they're warping around faster than light speed. Sometimes it takes them a few minutes to get somewhere. Sometimes it takes half the movie.<br/><br/>I have more points (like why were the drill operators wielding axes from 150 years in the future, like, they don't have guns in the future??) but suffice to say I felt dumber having watched this movie. I hope it tanks.<br/><br/>(/spoilers)"

Oh sure the names are there, and yes it's glitzy and expensive with lots of explosions...<br/><br/>Spocks mom dies...<br/><br/>for the really hardcore, there is a reference of Cardasians...<br/><br/>OH yeah, and there is Uhura making out with Spock on the transporter pad, and before that asking him if, and I quote ""just tell me what you want of me and i'll do it"" in a turbo lift as a way to console Spock after Vulcan had just been destroyed. What a way to make Uhura a cheap thrill ride...<br/><br/>It's okay though, cause OLD Spock, played poorly by Leonard Nimoy says that is an ""alternate time line"" and because of that it makes everything better...<br/><br/>Let me put my view into perspective. I watch the Old series, I watch the Next Generation, I watch DS9, I watch Enterprise. And I'm not even one of those guys who wears the uniform and lives the lifestyle...<br/><br/>But you know, I am so tired of Hollywood butchering the things that I grew up on.<br/><br/>And Trekkies? Oh the Trekkies will hate this.<br/><br/>Yeah, sure there is the Kobayashi Maru, which in all honesty is about the only thing canonical to this whole mess of a film, but other wise it was just one slight after another.<br/><br/>Chekhov is suddenly this wiz kid physicist, scotty is basically a garage mechanic, Uhura is suddenly this linguistic genius, Spock is just a tool, Sulu is a ninja, and Kirk... Well, Kirk is apparently the smartest person in Iowa with a genius I.Q. and a pension for being a rebellious wild child.<br/><br/>And for a moment let's talk about the Leonard Nimoy cameo. Why it's got Leonard Nimoys endorsement it must be good! And look he even says some key Spock Quotes! OOOO...<br/><br/>Yeah so what. It is a cheap ploy to get the trekkies to spend their money on something that will very soon be universally known as the absolute worst Star Trek in history.<br/><br/>It's even worse then 5...<br/><br/>In my many years and dollars of going to see movies, I have only walked out on 1. Tonight was my second. I never in a million years thought that I would walk out on a Star Trek movie. Never. But I went in there expecting and knowing it would be a reboot...<br/><br/>I never imagined this being a slap in the face.<br/><br/>People who know nothing of Star Trek will probably love it. However when they go back to watch the originals, they wont get it.<br/><br/>People who love Star Trek will hate this, and be thankful that there will always be the series.<br/><br/>But you know? It's okay that Spocks mom dies! It's okay that Spock and Uhura are lovers, and that she throws herself at like a cheap call-girl, it's okay that Chekhov is even there and all these things are okay! Because it's an alternate time line! And that makes everything better!!!!!!!! True Fans, you have been warned. This is not anything remotely close to the Star Trek that we know and love. It is hurtful and near hateful towards the series that has inspired us to look up into the star and dream of boldly going where no man has gone before.<br/><br/>It is disrespectful towards all of the black woman who were inspired by Nichelle Nichols to rise above the stereotypes of that day and age and become more then what they told they could be.<br/><br/>It is a perversion towards all of us kids who dreamed of being Captain Kirk, and discovering new life and new civilizations. A Kirk who was a seasoned hero and not hot headed firebrand who was given command like being given an expensive sports car by a rich uncle.<br/><br/>And it is an insult to all of us who crave knowledge and that delicate balance between logic and emotion.<br/><br/>**********End Spoilers*********"

","Not content to rest on his laurels in boring the world into a black hole with LOST, or writing some of the worst ever episodes of Felicity, J.J. Abrams set busily to his task of eviscerating Star Trek in a derivative, boring, 2 hours and 6 minutes of sadistic torture. With new credits ripped straight from Third Rock From The Sun and Simon Pegg sequences that seem to be taken from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Romulans who appear to have been extras from The Matrix. Do the makers of this film trust any of their OWN ideas!? Do they have any!? And the staple hopeful tone Star Trek is gone. Replaced by a war slash comedy tone that I would expect only to find in Red Dwarf or Starship Troopers. There are just enough seconds of great action in this film to fit into a great trailer. Yes that's right. That stuff you saw in the trailer? That's it, that's all of it, no more than that. There are just enough seconds truly funny comedy to fit into a comedy trailer. Surprise surprise! For the rest of it, we get people sitting around talking about nothing. Except they are in space... which is, you know, actually nothing. Unlike the New York of Seinfeld, which is, y'know, something. Oh, and did I mention that every character in TNG, DS9 and Voyager and Enterprise is dead? Oh, not dead. NEVER BORN! That's right, Picard and Data, will never exist. Never born. Because the timeline has been re-arranged. Re-arranged by who you ask? A small mining ship. A small mining ship with no time-sheilding has evaded the time-shielded time-police and killed Kirk's dad and destroyed the whole planet of Vulcan. Ri-ight. WTF? W T F!? How did they do away with the time police? Aren't a lot of the time-shielded time police FROM the planet Vulcan, that has just been destroyed by illegal unscheduled time travel of a tiny mining ship? If some kind of deity like Q has disabled the whole of the time police, why is it for such a small reason as destroying one tiny planet. Couldn't the deity destroy the planet with a flick of his finger? Oh wait, it's, you guessed it, Stargate! And why don't we see these juicy Q-type-bady-talks-to-bad-guys sequences?? Who knows.<br/><br/>Star Trek is supposed to be hopeful and inspire individuals to do good in the world. This is a war movie to inspire people to pick up a gun and do who knows what.<br/><br/>Star Trek Zero (official working title) gets a big ZERO from me. Awful, abysmal. One star because they don't allow lower."

","I was excited about this movie coming out. I wanted to like it. I was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>While some of the casting was spot on (I truly loved Karl Urban's portrayal of McCoy) others were horrible. This movie turned Uhura from the elegant professional she was into an oversexed adolescent. Scotty went from a dedicated professional to a buffoon. The worst, however, is Chris Pine's take on Kirk. Pine's Kirk is just another rubber stamp ""action hero"" – the same character we've seen in dozens of big budget action movies before. At no time did I believe him as James T Kirk.<br/><br/>The set designer for this movie should be blacklisted from Hollywood for the cheesy crap he/she threw at us. The engineering ""set"" looked like something from a bad Sci Fi Channel movie! I understand it was filmed in a power plant. They had $150 million to make this movie, and they couldn't build some actual sets? Ditto for Scotty's ""outpost"". The auditorium at Starfleet Academy looked like (and probably was) a tired and worn college lecture hall; complete with dingy 70's curtains. I could almost smell the mildew. Every time they showed that garbage, I was rudely jerked out of the tiny amount of suspension of disbelief that I was able to muster.<br/><br/>There were so many plot holes you could use this movie as a doily.<br/><br/>It felt as if the producers really hated Star Trek and were going out of the way to wipe out 40 years of canon. When they destroyed Vulcan and killed Spock's Mother, I nearly walked out.<br/><br/>This movie is not Star Trek. There is no heart, no soul. Nothing but over the top effects and violence. I know that this is what adolescent audiences want nowadays, but why pander to the lowest expectations? Why not give us something that wows us, and not just because it has awesome explosions, but because it engages our minds and imaginations. Even if you ignore it being Star Trek and examine it as just another effects laden Sci Fi movie, it comes up short.<br/><br/>This movie had so much potential. It was all wasted."
"frontrange","3","208","323","12 May 2009"," Gene Roddenberry is Rolling in his Grave
","I'll start my review with the disclaimer that I am indeed a hardcore Star Trek fan. The Trekkie in me wanted to give this a rating of 0/10, but I gave it a 3/10 for a few reasons: Good acting, good special effect, good action.<br/><br/>If those things are what you look for in a movie like this, you'll probably rank it a lot higher! From a Trekkie point of view, this movie was awful! Even for a parallel universe (which is a cop-out), I have HUGE issues with the movie. Starting with plot holes and writing issues:<br/><br/>* When children tease other children, they do it to feel superior. It is an emotional thing to do. So the Vulcan children that were teasing Spock, trying to get him to show emotion were doing so out of emotion themselves.<br/><br/>* Sarek (Spock's father) was one of the most logical Vulcan's ever in Star Trek. I can't imagine any universe ever when Sarek would tell Spock it is okay to feel anger and the reason he married Amanda (Spock's mother) was because he loved her.<br/><br/>* Romulus was ultimately destroyed by a star that went supernova. The only star that could destroy Romulus by going supernova would be the star at the center of Romulus' system. If the mysterious ""Red Matter"" were placed in the star to prevent the supernova, Romulus would be without a star anyway and the planet would freeze and die. Beyond that, a black hole in the center of a solar system would eat all the planets in the system too, including Romulus. So the planet was doomed no matter what.<br/><br/>* Apparently none of the writers or set designers had ever watched an original episode of Star Trek or seen a schematic. The lattice structures and water pipes in the Enterprise were ridiculous. Likewise, the bridge was horrible. A turbo lift where it should be, but a second door that doesn't lead to a turbo lift, but out onto the ship! The bridge is at the top of the ship...you can't have a door that leads to the rest of the ship.<br/><br/>* According to canon, the Enterprise was commissioned in 2245 under the command of Robert April. This would have been when Kirk was 12 years old. April commanded the ship for 9 years before Pike took command in 2254. Surely the destruction of the Kelvin wouldn't have changed these facts! But in the movie, the Enterprise is brand new when Pike takes command.<br/><br/>* A cadet (Kirk) that had not yet graduated from the academy (that was on academic suspension no less) got a field commission to first officer!?<br/><br/>* The hearing at the end of the movie appears to happen days after Nero is defeated. Consequently, Kirk is given command of the Enterprise. So Star Fleet saw fit to promote Kirk from Cadet past Ensign, Lieutenant JG, Lieutenant, Lieutenant Cmdr and Commander straight to Captain and give him command of the Flag Ship of the Federation!? Kirk was born in 2233 and this movie most likely took place in 2254. That would make Kirk 21 when he takes command.<br/><br/>* According to canon, Spock was born in 2232, making him one year older than Kirk. Yet in this movie, Spock is a full fledged Commander at the age of 22.<br/><br/>* Romulans are not first seen until 2266 (TOS: ""Balance of Terror""), yet everybody seems to recognize the Romulans as Romulans!<br/><br/>Those are just a few of the larger plot holes that I noted. Second, Star Trek has always been based on science. Warp drive, transporters, tractor beams, etc. They are all based on science. Beyond that, Star Trek science has rules just like real world science has rules. For example, there is a limit on Warp drive and there is a range on transporters. Here are a few of the science issues that I had:<br/><br/>* ""Red Matter"" – what is that all about? No explanation whatsoever. When it is placed in the center of a massive body (a planet, star, etc), it creates a singularity (black hole). A single dropyet the massive blob on Spock's ship is stable. And if it is stable because it is being suspended and not touching other matter, how is the hypodermic needle used to extract the red matter explained? At least antimatter has always been based on science. If it comes into contact with matter, the two annihilate each other (destructively). Hence the reason for antimatter containment chambers, warp core breaches, etc.<br/><br/>* Transporters have a range! In ""Star Trek 6: The Undiscovered Country"", Kirk and crew need to beam down to Khitomer to stop an assassination. Kirk asked if they are in transporter range and Spock says ""not yet"" and starts a countdown. They are well within the boundaries of the solar system at this point. In this new movie, Kirk and Scotty beam to the Enterprise from Delta Vega. The Enterprise was traveling at Warp 4, away from Delta Vega. That is roughly 100 times the speed of light: 18.6 million miles/sec or 67 billion miles/hour. If we assume Kirk was on the surface for 3 hours before he and Scotty beamed back to the Enterprise, the ship would be roughly 200 billion miles away from the planet. It is roughly 2.7 billion miles from Earth to Neptune (the outer limits of our Solar System). So they transported to a ship traveling at Warp 4 from a distance equal to almost 75 times the distance from Earth to Neptune. Oh, and earlier in the movie, they were having a hard time locking onto Kirk and Sulu because they were falling (not holding still).<br/><br/>I hope the world of Star Trek will quietly ignore this movie! Seemed to me like a simple excuse to try to shake the money tree once again."

","OK, so I have Nichelle Nichols' autograph, and a photo of me with James Doohan. I guess I was a Trekkie in my younger days -- but only for the original series, and I guess the films with the original crew, not the spin-offs. All the more reason I really wanted to like this film.<br/><br/>I don't even know where to begin. This film is a mess. It doesn't work for me as a popcorn movie, let alone as Star Trek. The plot is ridiculous and full of holes. (Black holes, get it?) Trekkies have always been able to forgive ridiculous plots (e.g. Star Trek movies three through six), as long as it meant we'd get to see Kirk and crew back in action. This so-called reboot is barely recognizable.<br/><br/>Rather than doing a sustained impression of William Shatner's Kirk, Chris Pine appears to have opted instead for a sustained impression of Christian Slater. Never mind how Pine plays Kirk, the character hardly resembles the original anyway. Instead of James T. Kirk, the master tactician who lived and breathed Starfleet, but wasn't afraid to buck the system, we get James T. Kirk, the reckless a-hole who has issues with authority.<br/><br/>Then there is Spock. Instead of cool, logical, level-headed but still part human Spock, we get vindictive, whiny Spock -- who is having a hot affair with Lt. Uhura, who herself appears to be a descendant of Beyonce.<br/><br/>All of the remaining characters -- including the villain -- are written and played fairly one-dimensionally. The only characters that seem to come close to the originals are Scotty -- who is in the film all too briefly -- and Chekhov.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know, this is now ""alternate universe"" Star Trek, because Nero and ""Spock Prime"" went back in time and changed the past, present and future. That shouldn't mean everything has to suck.<br/><br/>Woe to Leonard Nimoy, for not being able to resist a little more Spock money. The producers obviously lured him into this film to give it some Trek credibility (Trekibility), but it doesn't help. Shatner should be glad he wasn't asked.<br/><br/>Well, I know I am going against the grain here. This film has done huge box office, so JJ Abrams and crew will make more of them. Let me save you the trouble of waiting, or traveling to the future to see them: They will also suck."

","First, a disclaimer: I'm not a Trekkie. By a long shot. I couldn't give a hoot about how the movie fits in with the Star Trek ""canon"". Honestly, I couldn't care less. I watched it with an open mind, looking for entertainment. What I got instead was a bunch of frat boys and bimbos playing movie night, together with squirm inducing dialog, forced attempts at humor, and pandering to the Comic Book Guy fans (who got all the inside references about star fleet regulations, I'm sure). And yes, the plot was a mess.<br/><br/>Just a quick list:<br/><br/><ul><li>Kid Kirk driving the old car into the canyon, jumping out just in time to grab onto the edge of the abyss. What the ...?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lots of scenes were clearly shot inside some chemical plant. (Several stories high building with winding pipes running all over the place, etc.) I didn't know that space ships looked so much like your local sewage processing plant.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>6 billion people (OK, Vulcans) die, yet everybody acts as if it were ""no biggie"" (or maybe they were just that bad as actors? Who knows?) The unimaginable just happened and you were half expecting the crew to high- five each other by the end. Honestly, the guards at Auschwitz must have shown more understanding for a tragedy of such epic proportions.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Contriving to have each original character utter his/her ""catchphrase"" was so obviously forced that it was literally embarrassing to watch. I felt sorry for the actors. (Some people actually half-clapped when the old chestnuts were let slip. What the ...?)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I know it's a stupid Star Trek tradition, but I found it ""illogical"" (thank you, Mr. Spock), if not outright idiotic that it was always the highest echelons of the command structure that went on suicidal commando style missions. (It happened at least three times. At least.) There is a reason why armies no longer have their generals leading the charge: they are harder to replace than infantry (ensigns, red shirts, etc.) Mild complaint, but it got pretty annoying given how everybody was supposed to be so ""intelligent"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I found quite amusing the movie's sophomoric implication that Kirk's getting in a fight every minute or two is the surest implication that he'll make a good captain. It follows that Mike Tyson would make the best captain of the Enterprise. Ever. (You have a problem with that!?) Also, it was nice touch to have Spock and Kirk go mano o mano for the captainship (and becoming friends). Maybe the authors watched Fight Club one time too many? </li></ul><br/><br/>Funny thing is, with all the fawning, this is just another Star Trek movie (translation: campy melodrama with predictable plot)."

","I must admit that I had goosebumps at the beginning. Wow, I really love Star Trek, that is, the Star Trek I grew up with.... Picard, Riker, Data...Furthermore, all the past Star Trek movies are great, so this one will also be good...Or will it?!? As a recent thing, I begun watching the original Star Trek series, with Kirk and Spock. You can imagine, when I heard about this movie, I was thrilled :)<br/><br/>So, what about this movie? Well, it is quite bad, with no Star Trek feeling in it. Though, I know why it made so great at the box office. It is because people love this kind of movies. But if you are a hard core ST fan, it's really hard to chew it.<br/><br/>Spoilers, don't read if you haven't seen it!<br/><br/>My personal list of mistakes.<br/><br/>1)First mistake is that you lose half a movie because of character development. <br/><br/>2) Captain Pike had no first officer? The humanity was left with a bunch of raw cadets. Please consider today's armed forces. Where the hell, on this earth, all the experienced troops go out to war leaving their homeland unprotected. Anyway, I would imagine Pike could never promote a cadet like that. BUT hey, the movie has only 2 HOURS and at the end Kirk must be captain, you get the point :)))<br/><br/>3)Then, of course, Chekov loses Spock's mother in the most idiotic scene I have ever seen. By the way, anyone noticed how the transporters take FOREVER to dematerialize?<br/><br/>4)The romulans were digging up the planets with some sort of a chained drill (how ancient is that?). I'm just wondering, maybe(though very unlikely) there were no space ships around to disable that drill, but I would AT LEAST expect some sort of interceptors to be a last line of defense, for any planet. The only defense of Vulcan were 3 cadets jumping with parachutes? Give me a f***ing break please! And you could also stop and think why would a mining drill prevent teleportation and communications? Or was this forced in just to have the ""exciting"" parachute jump? <br/><br/>5) Kirk's mutiny made him end up on the same planet as the old Spock and Scotty. That is really cool and original...WOW, good call there. They found each other, probably, within hours, on a very hostile planet :)). Again, I must remind you, the movie is short, we must have a full crew by the end. Nevermind on how we do that ;)<br/><br/>6) Red matter?!? I missed that...Never heard of it. Hell, that's some powerful stuff. Again please, how did you come up with it? And if one drop was that powerful, why was Spock carrying like a tone of it?<br/><br/>7) Old Spock failed, to save the Romulan homeland, because...he arrived TOO late. Anyone here thinks they should have come up with a better story?<br/><br/>8) Nero, instead of destroying Earth goes after Spock? Yeah, of course... Anyway, nice looking mining ship you got there Nero, with lots of ammo on board. Apparently it can destroy entire fleets. Not too safe inside though, dangerous walkways, one wrong step and you're gone...<br/><br/>9) Kirk and Spock, they only sent those 2 on the enemy ship, instead of a trained assault team. 10, 20, 30 men...Give them hell, but noooo, instead we get an overrated shoot'em up comedy.<br/><br/>There is other stuff wrong, but hey, if you liked it, no matter what I think. <br/><br/>Good sound and effects in this movie. I must rate it a 3."

","On SNL last week I saw the two actors playing young Spock and Kirk declare that they tried very hard ""to stay true to Star Trek canon."" This is a gigantic lie.<br/><br/>This film completely rewrites 42 years of Trek history. Everything is different, and they used the cheapest of all plot devices (time travel) to do it. As with all time travel plots, the paradoxes and logical inconsistencies batter you about the head until you just give up thinking. TIME TRAVEL IS SCIENCE FICTION FOR MORONS.<br/><br/>I won't bother to list all the specifics - you can read them here in other reviews, and they are legion. Vulcan is destroyed. There are two Spocks, the younger of which is having an affair with Uhura. Spock's mother and Kirk's father (and billions of other current and future people) are now dead or will never exist. The Federation (somehow) knows about Romulans and Cardassians already. It goes on and on.<br/><br/>Oh, and despite the Burger King commercials, there are no Klingons in the film. Klingons are mentioned a couple of times as a minor plot device.<br/><br/>The short version is this: if you liked Trek before this film, you will not like this film. This film brazenly ""reboots"" everything you ever knew. None of it ever happened.<br/><br/>I'm ashamed of Leonard Nimoy for selling out for this piece of garbage. Kudos to everyone else from the *REAL* Trek who stayed far away. In my opinion, this film will be rejected by fans as never having happened. This ""alternate timeline"" will never be true Trek to me, just like Greedo still doesn't shoot first. Retcon it all you want - I will ignore it."
"yarborough","1","162","250","17 May 2009"," An Insult to Our Intelligence
","Just as the 3 ""Star Wars"" prequels ruined the Star Wars franchise (though I never liked it to begin with), this new ""Star Trek"" prequel is a damaging blow to the Star Trek movie franchise, and this prequel crap needs to stop now. The pathetic writers of this new Hollywood generation can't come up with any new, creative ideas, so they just keep going back in time (as they did with ""Batman Begins"") with established franchises, as if we need to see over and over again how the characters we love so much got their start. And the BIG problem with this new ""Star Trek"" movie is that they TOTALLY foul up the history of these characters and then insult our intelligence by having Spock (Prime - the older Spock) say that his actions altered the course of history (which, we learn, is why Kirk's father dies on the day of his birth this time around). What a lame, poor excuse for why the history of Mr. Spock, Captain Pike, Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy and even Chekov is so radically different from what it is in the Original Series and its Original movies. What is different? For one, in TOS, Kirk first served under Captain Robert April on a different starship, and had years of experience as a first officer before becoming captain. In this movie, Kirk's serves with Captain Pike of the Enterprise first, right alongside Spock, and on his FIRST day of service he becomes first officer and then on the very same day is suddenly promoted to Captain! Quite a leap up the ladder! In TOS, Spock is supposed to have served under Captain Pike 13 years before he and Kirk meet. Also, Dr. McCoy suddenly becomes Chief Medical Officer on the very same day that Kirk suddenly becomes Captain. Wow, what a coincidence! This movie so ridiculously rushes the whole thing, but it's OK because Spock altered everything, right? In this movie, Chekov is on the bridge as navigator even BEFORE Kirk ever steps foot on the Enterprise. That means he has MORE experience than Kirk! So in TOS how did Kirk become Captain while Chekov was a lowly ensign? Oh yeah, Spock altered history. And Chekov is said to be 17 in this movie. When did he start at Starfleet Academy--when he was 13?! Finally, this movie has no intelligent (or even intelligible) story. It has a ludicrous story of the Romulans (who look like a biker gang in this movie) creating Black Holes out of planets. And this movie is all action and loudness with dizzying camera shaking, which totally goes against TOS's cleverness of playing on ideas rather than action. Abrams has no business in the ""Star Trek"" franchise, and I hope he never makes another ""Star Trek"" movie. But I guess as long as they make plenty of $$$$, it doesn't matter. That's more important than being faithful to the characters and history of the show, right?"
"shanenzinla","1","149","229","15 May 2009"," Doubly bad
","Firstly: Not only is the writing vapid, you have no empathy towards the two dimensional characters and so the entire movie is missing pathos. The plot is itself thin, it seems that a few explosions and special effects are the limits of depth to this director. I wasted 80 bucks buying tickets to this piffle. And the lapses in logic, (one of many examples: why would any military grant a cadet Captaincy of the Federations most valuable warship?)<br/><br/>Secondly: For those of us with a memory, this movie is an insult. Repudiate years of my interest in a series solely because you have lazy writers is a huge insult to those of us who have wasted four decades watching Star Trek just to have every television program and movie repudiated to give these idiots ""creative space""?

"Sir Rob","9","519","837","8 April 2009"," Star Trek: Rebooted!
","Last night I was lucky enough to be one of the few to attend the world premiere of J.J. Abram's ""Star Trek"" at the Sydney Opera House. This red carpet event was every bit as surreal and magical as the film itself.<br/><br/>The film in many ways matched the venue – unreal. You have doubtless heard or seen other reviews (as I have) and they probably say the same thing: this is (in every sense of the phrase) a second take on the Star Trek universe, from the beginning.<br/><br/>From the opening sequence, JJ Abrams asserts his authority in a plot twist which will shake the very fabric of the Star Trek universe. In a sudden (plot) twist, the very nature of the film becomes clear: this is a new Star Trek.<br/><br/>However, the opening sequence delivers more than just this ""statement"" - it also gives us a taste of what is to come: action, drama, solid performances and an outstanding introduction to a new era.<br/><br/>Little by little we are introduced to the main characters, starting with Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Uhura as we briefly navigate their early lives including events at Starfleet Academy before hitting a plot crescendo which brings all the cast together – and to the starship Enterprise, NCC 1701! <br/><br/>This is a movie strong on character development, and each of the actors deliver brilliant performances – nothing less would be appropriate given the shoes each has to fill.<br/><br/>The movie moves along at an agreeable pace, never slow enough to be tedious, nor too frenetic so as to be judged another ""run 'n' gun"" style sci-fi action flick.<br/><br/>This is a movie with cutting edge special effects, but they serve more to frame the storyline and characters rather than to be the show entirely.<br/><br/>Star Trek has always been tied to models and great visuals, so this is something which we've come to expect from this groundbreaking franchise.<br/><br/>Since I do not intend to introduce spoilers in this review, I can only really say that the crew of the USS Enterprise is brought full circle to face the film's dark enemy, a Romulan by the name of Nero who is portrayed by Australia's own Eric Bana (who is not given nearly enough screen time in my humble opinion).<br/><br/>By now you've probably heard that the movie also features Leonard Nimoy – reprising his role as Mr (please, not Doctor) Spock. This is indeed true, however you may be surprised to learn that this is no token cameo role.<br/><br/>Leonard Nimoy's Spock plays a pivotal role in the film, and in a way bridges the franchise from the original series to the new film version. He also has delivery of my most favorite line in the film..<br/><br/>Each actor holds their own with the roles we know so well. It would be unfair to single out any specific actor.. but I have to say that Simon Pegg and Zachary Quinto are simply outstanding amongst a group of very talented actors in a movie which is (perhaps a little surprisingly) carried by strong character development.<br/><br/>In summary, this film is likely to appeal to a wide audience including die hard Trekkies and those new to the Star Trek universe. This is a must see film, even if you can't tell the difference between a Tribble and a Tholian!"
"Skippster","3","189","294","8 May 2009"," Quo vadis Star Trek?
","Personally, I usually don't think that people need to hear my opinion about movies, because after all there simply is no accounting for taste. However Star Trek isn't a personal but rather a political issue for me. Being in my early twenties I may not consider myself a 40-years-of-Star-Trek-Fan, nevertheless the franchise did have a share in my growing-up and it sure had a share in my personality development, too.<br/><br/>When I bought tickets for Star Trek I already had a bad feeling about seeing my beloved universe getting crushed down by a state-of-the-art Sci-Fi-Action movie, which wasn't that improbable after what happened in Star Trek X. The trailers which I had watched so far enforced my concern. I will not say, all my fears and concerns have proved true. (In which case I should have picked 0 stars instead of 3.) Since the cast at least seems to try hard, some jokes made me laugh (I honestly hadn't expected that to happen), and some scenes even seemed a little authentic I rate this movie with 3 out of 10. I wasn't upset nor was I furious about the whole thing, yet it left me with a deep feeling of disappointment. Why? Because the ""Star Trek"" (universe, franchise, saga, whatever you might call it) as I got to know it is gone - irrevocably gone. Of course, we fans have to adjust to new; new cinematography, new actors, new stories. We always had to. If you compared Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway and Archer, you could see five very different types of characters, yet we managed to adjust (..well to .. most of them...). We managed to adjust as we always did, because change was what kept Star Trek alive. <br/><br/>What did disappoint me so much was the choice for a time travel plot creating an ""alternative timeline"" which allows/allowed the film-makers to work with Star Trek while creating something new from the beginning, too. (I believe this has euphemistically been called a reboot, yet if you reboot your computer you don't actually get a new one out of doing so.) It seems to me as if they just wanted to make a Star Trek movie for the masses so badly and at all costs, but without even bothering to watch the shows and engage themselves in the history. I don't blame them for making a prequel - I blame them for thinking they could take Star Trek, remove all of what we fans knew and then put it back on the screen with still the Star Trek label on it. (...and actually believe they could get away with it...) You see, this attitude bugs me so much, and I haven't even criticized some of the weird stuff they present us in this movie. (What the frick is Red Matter?) <br/><br/>There was a time when I was laughed at and mocked by others because I regularly watched Star Trek shows. I always took comfort in the fact that Star Trek was something special, a show that invites you to think, that held more than just the visible, a show in which effects were used to support the plot - not to replace it. Today I don't feel like laughing back at people who have never even considered watching a Star Trek show and are now surprisingly caught by some other big budget Sci-Fi movie. I feel like I lost something valuable. If you go to the movies, don't expect a pleasant surprise. Prepare for the worst, and you might end up giving it 3 stars still. Next time you watch TOS, TNG or DS9 you will probably be even more thankful for what Gene Roddenberry has bequeathed us."
"ajstarex","1","333","531","3 May 2009"," The Lucas Syndrome invades Star Trek
","Star Trek is not about the past but rather about the future. This new movie is not the Star Trek that we know and have loved for more than 40 years, is in fact a poor excuse to gain market and to reboot (erase) the series completely. The end result: what will happen with all the Star Trek after TOS? Is already known that this movie connects the Star Trek Countdown comics in order to create an alternative reality since Nero and Spock travel through time but not to our Star Trek time-line, but another alternative reality (SPOILER). Nero's effect on that time-line by killing Kirk's father does affect the alternative reality in this new Star Trek. In addition Spock's interference changes completely the time-line for this parallel (in such way) universe. So, what we are seeing is not our Star Trek but rather a new version of it. Not the best solution since there was a lot of great ideas after Nemesis. This is by far the Lucas Syndrome, ""if you are out of ideas, then create a prequel."" <br/><br/>(SPOILER) Romulus, Remus and a large part of the Romulan Empire get destroyed in the very late 24th century (see Star Trek Online and Star Trek Countdown) and the result is Nero and Spock arriving at this universe. The time-line here is completely different from our Star Trek, so what we know is no longer canon, since this is like a goodbye to our beloved Star Trek. In its place, what we get? Huge explosions, short skirts, sex, and a movie lacking of morality. Star Trek is not about that, is about a message, is about going forward and explore strange new worlds.<br/><br/>I'm afraid that this movie will eventually erase what we know about Star Trek and the effort of all the productions, writers, casts and all the people related to previous Trek series. I hope fans will realize that shiny explosions and short skirts is not everything... BRING OUR STAR TREK BACK!!! BRING TNG, DS9 and VOY BACK!!!<br/><br/>""Resistance is Futile."""

And then the Death Star homes in on the Rebel Base - Umm, I mean the mining ship homes in on Starfleet headquarters, and only Luke Skywalker can stop it by ignoring orders and turning off his targeting computer and trusting the Force - no, I mean only Jim Kirk can stop it by ignoring Starfleet's orders and trusting his instincts.

Why would Spock do that? Why would ANY Starfleet officer abandon one of their own on a frozen planet full of deadly Wampas during the middle of an interstellar war - err, interstellar terrorist event?<br/><br/>Spock should have been court-martialed for that. No commanding officer in any military organization would ever do that, anywhere, any time, for any reason.<br/><br/>Luckily, the evil tattoo-faced bad guy, Darth Maul - umm, Nero, did THE EXACT SAME THING to his sworn enemy, Old Spock, who showed up just in time to save Kirk, which was really lucky, because Kirk didn't have his lightsaber handy to cut off the snow-monster's arm.<br/><br/>So Spock and Nero are morally equivalent with each other, both banishing their enemies to a frozen wasteland. How symmetrical.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this happens to be the exact same planet that Montegomery ""Scotty"" Scot was also unfairly banished to! What a lucky coincidence! <br/><br/>Old Spock knew Kirk and Scotty in the future! And in the future, Scotty figured out a way to magically beam onto a ship moving faster than the speed of light half a galaxy away! And Old Spock remembers how he did it! Yay! Magic!<br/><br/>Now, smart people would have used this trick to beam the bad guys off of their own ship, and into the vacuum of space, where they would have died, and Earth would have been saved.<br/><br/>This movie is not about smart people.<br/><br/>The villain is a coal miner from the future. He hates Spock because Spock tried to save his homeworld from destruction. So it's Spock's fault? Why? Because Spock got there too late - did Spock stop off for some fast food or something? Why is it Spock's fault?<br/><br/>I mean, if I my planet were destroyed, and I got sucked a hundred years into the past, I would warn my planet, so they could start evacuating. I would use my enormous mining ship to start ferrying off the billions of refugees to a nice safe planet, not go around the galaxy destroying all of the most habitable worlds.<br/><br/>It's not just Nero who is mentally challenged, though. Old Spock needs only a few drops of ""Red Matter"" to turn a supernova into a black hole - but he's got like fifty gallons of it on board his ship. Why? Is that smart? Is that safe? What if a bunch of terrorists were able to get hold of all that Red Matter by capturing your puny little vessel? Duh! I think Old Spock is a bit senile.<br/><br/>Let's face it.

Also kirks middle name is thrown about far too much considering it took 3 seasons & 6 movies for it to be revealed. (originals of course) in this film it seems like overkill.

","Space: The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its 5 year mission. To explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before...<br/><br/>I cite these lines because they pretty much sum up what Start Trek was all about. It was about adventure and exploration. About the mysteries of deep space and alien cultures. About science, tolerance and understanding between different peoples and species and so much more. Star Trek (most of the time) used to provoke thoughts and imagination and to inspire it's audience in many ways.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems the makers of this new Star Trek movie didn't understand any of this. Nor did they seem to bother. They obviously thought making a Star Trek movie would be easy. Just take some famous characters and spaceship design, stuff it with (forgettable) CGI, throw in some trendy shaking camera action (which is just pathetic) and it will all somehow magically fall into place and make a good movie. They were so wrong. I really can't begin to imagine how anyone could honestly think they would get away with this. The sad thing is: They just might. For some reason the IMDb rating was around 8.4 (when I wrote this) which suggests there actually are people who liked this movie and I suppose it won't fail at the box office.<br/><br/>I won't summarize the plot because others already did that. Suffice it to say that because of time traveling, history got changed and we are presented an alternative universe which 'allows' this movie and potential follow-ups to completely 're-imagine' Star Trek. What bothers me most is that this movie dares to negate the entire Star Trek saga. It tells us that all those countless adventures we witnessed never happened! That might have been acceptable if we had been given something new that's worthy of Star Trek. Sadly, that's not the case.<br/><br/>The plot is shallow, full of (black) holes and often lacking in logic. The characters are mostly boring, one-dimensional and unconvincing. Kirk a rebel, bar brawler, womanizer and suddenly heroic starship captain? Sounds like Kirk, but I didn't buy any of it. I'm not sure whether this is to blame on Chris Pine portraying him or the writers, but it just didn't work. And what about Scotty? He's just silly and annoying, a bit like Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars. The only real good character was Zachary Quinto's Spock. I liked him a lot. Some others were good too, like Cpt. Pike and Dr. McCoy, but they didn't add much to the plot. There also was Leonard Nimoy as old Spock, but there was nothing particularly interesting about him. Actually, half-way through the movie I realized I wasn't caring for anything or anyone in it. And of course, this movie had nothing to do with exploration, adventure or imagination. Which is why to me it seemed quite laughable that at the end this movie cites those famous lines about 'Space: The final frontier'.<br/><br/>I usually don't write reviews, but for this I had to make an exception. I grew up with Star Trek and loved most of the shows and movies. And I had to express how wrong this new movie felt to me. This is not about me being frustrated about the time and money I spent watching it. I don't want my money back. I don't regret having seen it. And it's nowhere near the worst movie I've ever seen. I actually enjoyed it to a certain degree as another mindless action flick. And as such I'd probably rate it somewhere around 5 out of 10. But in the context of it being labeled 'Star Trek' and being highly overrated on IMDb can't give it more than 2/10.<br/><br/>Simply put: It's a disgrace to Star Trek."
"captkirk_4","2","225","356","8 May 2009"," The character of Captain Kirk reduced to a juvenile delinquent or 'Fast and Furious' redone with Starships.
","I was eagerly anticipating this release for the last few weeks and went to see it opening weekend. The first scene started out with a well done space battle but things immediately started to deteriorate when the battle turned out to be the birth scene of James T. Kirk, an unnecessarily overly dramatic writing of Kirk's birth. Things didn't improve when we next met the orphaned Kirk racing around Iowa and recklessly destroying his uncles antique Corvette. Very out of character for the command officer James T. Kirk we know from the series. As a matter of fact I doubt that those familiar with the series are the intended audience of this film as the aforementioned scene seemed merely and excuse to throw in a classic muscle car and a song by AC-DC.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie James Kirk behaves like a wild undisciplined punk nothing at all like anyone who would ever be able to function in a military environment. The writers took some character nuances of Kirk and totally overdid it. A good example of professional military officers who also like to joke around and enjoy the ladies is found in The Right Stuff. Yes they break the rules now and then but nowhere in that movie did you doubt the Mercury 7 were professional military officers responsible for advanced aerospace technology. Spock was right in his decision to throw Kirk off the ship after his near mutiny in time of war by a starfleet cadet. Most of the rest of the familiar crew members are caricatures of themselves delivering clichés of the shows dialog as if this is a Saturday Night Live skit. Bruce Greenwood was good as Captain Pike, but he got fairly little screen time. Zachary Quinto was OK as Spock, though he had to work through a few ridiculous love scenes with Uhuru thrown in senselessly by the writers.<br/><br/>Here we encounter another common movie-making flaw, Too Many Cooincidences. Turns out Kirk, Bones, Uhuru, all went to starfleet academy together. There is little indication on the show that the Enterprise bridge crew all had deep relationships with each other predating their assignment to the Enterprise, and such a situation would be highly unlikely in the real world. Kirk was known as being quite young for a captain, but he was always insinuated as being senior to his bridge crew with the exception of the Dr. and Chief Engineer.<br/><br/>But most egregious is once again another grandiose time travel plot, this time with a Romulan (well played by Eric Bana) coming back from the future to destroy the federation. The whole bit about Romulus being destroyed in a supernova is preposterous to anyone with an astronomical background as Stars that go supernova are too short lived to develop habitable planets, and they are also unstable for thousands of years before they go boom which would have caused anyone living nearby to have abandoned their planets as the star went red giant and threw off shell after shell of gas. There is way too much time travel in sci fi these days. In a comedy like Star Trek 4 it works because the movie is never too serious in tone, but time travel leaves too many logical conundrums to make good sci fi.(i.e why don't the Klingons just go back and destroy Earth in the past) Time travel is something that most probably is impossible. <br/><br/>Worst of all is the writers ""re-imagining"" Star Trek by destroying the Planet Vulcan in the new Star Trek universe. I had expected that Kirk and Spock would restore the time-line at the end, but no they let this travesty stand. The re-imagined Battlestar Gallactica was a much more thought out improvement over the original despite some annoying feminist overtones. This re-imagining was essentially 'Fast and Furious' redone with Starships. On the positive side the action and special effects are spectacular in this film, but aren't they in most all films these days. In summary if you are unfamiliar with the Star Trek franchise you will enjoy the fast paced action effects sequences which are quite enjoyable. But if you are a fan of the original you will detest the slaughtering of the characters."

","For all those who are under 18 and this is their first exposure to the Star Trek saga, I urge you to see the greatest Star Trek movie of them all: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. ""Khan"" is the standard on which all Star Trek movies and episodes must be measured against. The writers of the new 'Star Trek' movie claim that their inspiration was the 'Wrath of Khan' and would like to think that their new 'update' is equal to the earlier masterpiece. Unfortunately I must report that the new 'Star Trek' is nowhere close to Star Trek II. Quite the contrary, it is a pathetic mess of a screenplay and until you see 'The Wrath of Khan', you cannot understand what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The new 'Star Trek' attempts to re-imagine the characters from the original TV series when they were young, just beginning their careers. The casting director did well to choose actors who bore a resemblance to the original cast. The writers claim in interviews that they aimed to fill in the back story of the characters by detailing their past histories before, during and right after their initiation at Starfleet Academy as Federation officers. But in actuality, they do the opposite. Take Dr. McCoy, the idiosyncratic chief medical officer—the actor who plays him looks a lot like a young DeForrest Kelley (the original 'Bones') but the comparison ends there. Bones is hardly integrated into the story at all. He doesn't have the humor of the original character nor is there enough of the idiosyncratic charm. In the new 'Star Trek', the character is reduced to a buffoon, chasing Kirk around the ship, trying to inject him with a hypodermic. This is the only time we get to know anything about him.<br/><br/>Now take Uhura. In the original, she was the cool, consummate professional, always guiding the Enterprise through tough waters by way of her technical expertise. Here she is the opposite: unprofessional and overemotional. I was embarrassed when she tries to kiss Spock numerous times in the turbolift after the planet Vulcan was destroyed. Here Spock is trying to cope with the annihilation of six million of his people and all Uhura wants to do is make out! You call that class??? And what about Chekov? All they have the character do is mimic the Russian accent of the original character. How did they make him different or improve on the original? Even worse is Sulu. All he gets to do is parachute down to what looks like the platform of an oil rig where he aids Kirk in a ridiculous fight against some bad guys. I thought Scotty had the most potential of the supporting players. At least he projected the good nature of the original character but it was kind of disappointing when he must rely on Leonard Nimoy (the old Spock) to give him the new warp speed formula.<br/><br/>The new James T. Kirk looks like a young William Shatner but he too lacks the charm of the original. More could have done with Kirk's early days on Earth especially in showing how the future might look. I liked the cop on the flying motorcycle but a peek at a future 'watering hole' seemed quite derivative (check out the first Star Wars where Harrison Ford struts through the intergalactic bar). Depicting Kirk as a rebellious hothead seems part of the original Star Trek lore, but the humor is missing.<br/><br/>The new Spock doesn't at all measure up to the old Spock. The early scene where a very young Spock confronts a group of Vulcan 'bullies' was cute but after that it was all downhill. The problem is that the Kirk-Spock relationship is too heavy-handed. It's one thing to show conflict between the two but when they come to blows, it just seemed so un-Spocklike. Contrast that with Spock's decision to disobey Kirk's command at the end of the ""Wrath of Khan"". Kirk and Spock are noble characters and somehow the conflict between them seems juvenile and trivial. Or maybe it was a matter of the plot where the stakes weren't high enough. The writers simply did not give the characters an opportunity to display the complexity of the relationship.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst part of the new Star Trek is the depiction of the villain, the disaffected Nero. I seem to recall that by Star Trek: Next Generation, the Romulans had become a group of worthy adversaries to the denizens of the Federation. But here, the last Romulan, Nero, is a bald guy with tattoos plastered all over his head. All he can do is snarl throughout the movie. Contrast that with Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan. Again, no comparison! Plotwise, the new Star Trek wasn't clever at all. Beginning with the unnecessary flashback to the tale of Kirk's father's heroism, we're treated to one tired battle scene after another. What's worse is that the film's writers have created a new alternative Star Trek universe. Can you imagine the entire planet of Vulcan being destroyed in any of the earlier movies or episodes? It would never happen. Hey Vulcan is supposed to be populated with some of the smartest guys in the universe and they let themselves be annihilated by a Romulan who looks like a skinhead using a drilling machine that creates black holes! <br/><br/>It was nice seeing Leonard Nimoy reprising the role of the original Spock but I was sad to see just how much the actor has aged. Contrary to all the hype, the new Star Trek lacks the charm, humor and complexity of the some of the earlier incarnations. Go back and check out Wrath of Khan and some of the best of the Star Trek episodes from television. If they decide to make a second 'new' Star Trek, hopefully the studio will hire a group of better writers."

","Honestly, this is the worst franchise exploitation train wreck since the dreadful Alien vs. Predator: Requiem disaster. I really wish the producers of this film would have just called this crud ""Space Wars"" so as not to tarnish the good name of Star Trek. This movie reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons where anything goes for no apparent reason but to insert a laugh or a stupid stunt. There is no logical, comprehensible storyline or continuity here. Kirk behaves like an obnoxious self-centered jerk who doesn't deserve to be in charge of anything let alone the Federation's flagship. Spock always looks like he's not in control of his emotions & apparently he thinks it's logical to be making out with his communications officer whenever possible. The black hole science is absurd. Thanks to instant black holes ( just add red matter ) one can either travel in time or crush an enemy ship or destroy a planet in a singularity. You're going to have to regress your brain, BIG TIME, in order to stomach this film's physics. If you are able to dumb down your brain to the point that, say, you not only believe that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are cool but you believe they actually exist, then you can enjoy this inane story. Otherwise keep your popcorn bag close by in case you feel the urge to vomit. I never thought the Star Trek movies were anything more than average popcorn fare, save for maybe The Wrath of Kahn, which probably best captures the essence of Gene Roddenberry's vision. This movie is a just a vile pile of Hollywood crap. You won't suck me in again all you fake reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes!"

","The initial idea was great. Fans expected some good story telling about time before The Original Series. But we got childish mambo-jumbo with lot of explosions and incoherent plot. We learned that planet Vulcan was destroyed, but how did it manage to exist in The Original Series and movie sequels? Why did screenplay ignore the knowledge of fans in such arrogant way? Acting looks like gang of high school boys and girls having fun of private party. OK, I can understand if in the mind of production the target consumers supposed to be children, but why all the fans from 1960s were ignored? Pity for such a great franchise.

"phucitol","1","79","119","12 May 2009"," Ugh...what did I just watch?
","How the original Trek cast began? I think not. First off they couldn't even get decent ""young"" look-alikes except for Karl Urban who plays McCoy. Simon Pegg who plays Scotty LOOKS older then the supposedly younger cast members and has the personality of an Irish drunk they just picked up off the street. Not to mention the idiotic young Kirk played by Chris Pine whose childhood begins as a rebel and passes his time away getting into bar room brawls, scooping & boffing chicks, and hiding under beds to check out Uhura in her underwear. Oh yeah, did anyone tell you about the Spock and Uhura ""love thang"" going on in the transporter yet? Come on, Gene Roddenberry is turning in his grave over this mess. They had the audacity to take classic clichés like McCoy's ""Dammit Jim"", Spock's ""Facinating"" and Sulu's love for fencing and turned them into REAL Hollywood clichés. Forget about the effects, it's nothing you haven't already seen in any Battlestar Galactica episode. This film has so many holes in regard to the original series and cast it surpasses Swiss cheese yet smells like Limburger. The biggest being how the technology (set design) looks to be about 200 years more advanced then the original. The original mission was to explore new worlds and go where no man has gone before. Although these characters fell together as a crew by coincidence. On account of a rift between the Romulans and Vulcans, and the Vulcan planet being turned into a black hole. Uh-huh....where did that come from Orci and Kurtzman? Your butts? I went to see this with my 14 year old nephew whose never seen an original episode. Afterward he said he didn't want to see any and thought they would be as stupid as this movie. Yes, those were HIS words. I had to reassure him that not everything newer is necessarily better. How true it is, how true it is! Stay light years away from this."

","Poor, poor Gene Roddenberry. The great memory of the wonderful things he accomplished have been set aflame with one swift stroke! The only question that will always linger with me forever in eternity is who, I say again WHO green-lit this project and actually thought it was a good idea?! JJ Abrams has absolutely NO successful track record to speak of, has NO visual sense of cinematography, NO idea of storytelling and for the franchise worst of all has NO IDEA what the term ""Science"" fiction means! The so-called film is rife with laughable inaccuracies, absurd set designs, horrible makeup and costumes, pitiful so-called dialouge, and by far the most atrocious acting this side of ... well I honestly don't believe I have EVER seen such worthless attempts in my life! With the exception of the actor who played McCoy, this movie seemed as if it was made by retarded preschoolers (no offense to either mentally handicapped or preschoolers) I have literally seen better acting out of birds and roaches! The wanna be story had no general point and made no sense what ever, but the most appalling travesty of all is the total and utter lack of reality and the miss-use of ""Science"" all together! Mr. Roddenberry always stated and went far out of his way to make sure the franchise was grounded in truth and reality based on factual, credible science. Apparently ol' JJ didn't get the memo, oh wait he said himself HE WAS NEVER A STAR TREK FAN TO BEGIN WITH!! I ask again, who actually thought it was a good idea to hire this clown (and again, I mean offense to clowns out there by relating them to this sad-sac)?! OK, I originally stated that there would be spoilers in this comment, but I then realized why bother? To continue to pine on about the horrors of one the worst movies ever made and the final and ULTIMATE nail in the franchise's coffin would only serve to give some sort of obscene credence to what is ultimately a disaster on a scale never before witnessed in the entertainment world. If you are a fan of either the series or movies in general, I would ask that you spare yourself the misery and watch something, ANYTHING else! For shame, and a sad regretful farewell to series that has meant so much and has done so well for so long. I suppose not everything is meant to ""Live long and prosper"" ..."
"catherine-doyle35","2","206","328","6 May 2009"," Disappointing
","I'm afraid that's a big thumbs-down. Before I begin, I should fess up to being a dedicated Star Trek fan and Trekkie for nearly 15 years. And as to my viewership of the current output of the JJ Abrams/Bad Robot stable, I thought LOST Seasons 1 was amazing, and have stuck with the show despite a huge drop in quality. Fringe, co-created by Abrams, Alex Kurtzmann and Roberto Orci, has the dubious distinction of being pretty much the only TV show on which I gave up, mainly because I couldn't stomach such appalling writing. As the credits rolled on this Trek film, and listed Orci and Kurtzmann as writers, it all made a disappointing kind of sense, as these three guys have never met a contrived and incoherent plot they didn't love.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 'contrived' and 'incoherent' describes the plot of this movie all too accurately. I will freely admit that there's a lot of stuff that I found annoying specifically because I am a Trekkie, but there are also fundamental flaws in the movie as a piece of cinema, with the plot being a prime example. It's badly-conceived and poorly written in the worst possible way, with people acting out of character, and to be honest, stupidly, in order to set up a chain of unbelievable events to keep the plot limping along. A good plot should not depend on shoehorned and forced events, and characters should be consistent, instead of acting merely to service the plot.<br/><br/>The science is woeful. I know we have to cut movies some slack, Star Trek was noted for being pretty accurate with the real-world science they used, but that's certainly not the case here.<br/><br/>Now to what annoyed me, as a Trekkie. Abrams has stated that he was never a fan of the original Trek, and man, does it show. He and the writers have only a passing familiarity with basic stuff like the command structure of a starship. It seems that, if the captain wishes it, lowly cadets who haven't even graduated from the academy yet, can be promoted to command positions, leap-frogging an entire crew of officers. At one point, I found myself wondering, 'Who the hell is the second officer, and where are they?' And as characters we know will be the main crew arrive on board and automatically take charge of their departments, it raises the question, who exactly was the senior staff when they shipped out? There's a romantic relationship between two main characters, that I thought was highly implausible and unbelievable, for two major reasons. I can't say any more without revealing the identity of the characters, but you'll know it when you hit it.<br/><br/>A major event occurs that will have a profound effect on both the Federation and the Alpha Quadrant, which I was not down with at all. It felt like Abrams attempting to demonstrate that nothing and no one is safe in his new shiny version of Trek.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the Vulcans was pretty inconsistent. While Zachary Quinto is good as Spock, the elder Vulcans are much too emotional. In one scene, a Vulcan chats away as if he's human. Ironically, the dialogue concerns the repression of emotion. And I'm pretty sure another Vulcan elder smiled at one point.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg does the best he can as Scotty, but writing that role as comic relief was a terrible mistake. The humour in general is very hit and miss. Trek was never about ridiculous comedy in the midst of a crisis. The funniest parts are what they lifted directly from classic Trek, for example McCoy bitching about Spock and his 'goddamn Vulcan mind'.<br/><br/>And as the last negative point, they also changed the iconic 'Space...the final frontier' speech. Two small changes - 'continuing mission' to 'on-going mission', and 'strange new life' to 'strange new lifeforms' - but they add nothing to the speech, and merely serve to again show that nothing is sacred when JJ Abrams is at the helm. Only hardcore fans will even notice those changes, so it's like a secret little 'Up yours' to the fans. The fans that he claims he doesn't need. The same fans that kept Star Trek going for the last 40 years.<br/><br/>I'm going to finish with the good points, because yes, there are some. Karl Urban as Bones is bang-on, right from the get-go. McCoy's dialogue is in character too, mainly because they lifted it straight from the source, as mentioned previously. All the main cast are alright. Chris Pine as Kirk grew on me throughout the film. The biggest change of role is probably Uhura, who takes a much more active part than she used to, but that's not unwelcome. And the attention to details on the dates is OK. And that's about all the good stuff.<br/><br/>I would be hesitant about recommending this film to casual cinema fans, because at its core, it's basically a stupid movie. I would most certainly advise Trekkies to stay away from it. If given the choice between watching this, and watching the 3 worst Voyager episodes in a row, there is only one way to go. I'd plump for Janeway, Chakotay, Neelix and even Kes over this, and that's really saying something."

","Actually this isn't Star Trek at all.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams has been doing the rounds of talk shows and news programs. Shilling for people to come out and watch his movie. I find it amazing that in every interview, he makes a special point to go out of his way to say that he didn't like Star Trek, he didn't watch Star Trek, he was never a fan of the show, he didn't know any of the history or mythology of the Star Trek universe and that he didn't really understand or care for the Star Trek phenomenon.<br/><br/>Trust me. It shows.<br/><br/>Abrams has made this new Star Trek movie with all the meticulous attention to detail and tender loving care that a McDonald's burger flipper puts into an Egg McMuffin. Slap it together, throw it at the customer, and grab their money before they notice you just served them a cold pile of pig fat.<br/><br/>The characters seem to be genuinely confused and bewildered that they have stumbled into a Star Trek movie. Each character gets to utter one or two recognizable catch phrases. I suppose so that the audience can make an educated guess about which actor is supposed to be playing which role. They mouth their painful dialog with all the emotion and sincerity of a seventh grade debate team member who just dropped their index cards.<br/><br/>The film is bad on so many levels, and so devoid of any possible connection to world of Star Trek, that it is difficult to imagine this is not intentional parody. If only Syler and Pine could have brought half the subtlety to Spock and Kirk that Chase and Belushi did, it would have been a better movie.<br/><br/>Set design had all the verisimilitude of the psycho Trekkies who build Enterprise bridge sets in their living rooms. Special effects appear to have been pieced together on a old, broken down Amiga 2000, with the climactic battle taking place between the most pedestrian and geriatric Enterprise ever seen and a giant space tumbleweed. They producers loved this footage so much that showed it twice in the movie, for two different generations.<br/><br/>The evil, creaky, leaky, fungus ship was crewed and captained by Romulan gangbangers, whose prime motivation seems to be that they wanted to get paid for appearing in the movie. (They should have asked for more money.) Star Fleet seem to have replaced the velour material of their uniforms with shower curtain material.<br/><br/>Orci & Kurtzman, the Click and Clack of Hollywood writers have thrown together another two hour bathtub full of endless, pointless explosions and laser blasts without a semblance of logic or continuity. They no longer seem to feel the need to have any detectable plot or story come out of their work. Just write a script thin enough that Burger King can cover it on four collectible glasses and cash the check.<br/><br/>The only grace note of this travesty was Leonard Nimoy. Returning one final time to hold a mirror up to humanities foibles, his Spock is always insightful, gentle, playful, and a tower of steely strength in the midst of disaster. He shows us why we liked Star Trek in the first place, and how little this rip off has to offer by comparison.<br/><br/>R.I.P. Star Trek, you deserved a better sendoff than this."

As another reviewer wrote, I suggest to those still with a brain in reasonable condition: leave it in the front door, in case you insist to watch this expensive nonsense. In an ideal world, it would be great if these Hollywood 'geniuses' leave the iconic works of the past stay at their own (recent catastrophic sequels or remakes including X-Files, The Day The Earth Stood Still, etc).

One of TOS episodes ""Shore Leave"" has Kirk meeting people from his academy days such as Finnigan and the former love of his life, Ruth. Kirk explained to Spock he was ""positively grim"" as a student at Star Fleet. Definitely not the character in the movie. Other points made in TOS, referencing a young Ensign Kirk and his brother Sam were completely ignored. Also, the Kobiyashi Maru exercise,in the Wrath of Khan, it was explained the Kirk received a commendation for his original thinking.

Well done portrayals and you can see the actors did their homework.<br/><br/>As someone that watched TOS when it was originally on TV and have been a big fan for 40 years, I was very unimpressed. But, I can see how this movie would appeal to younger viewers, but not people like myself that love TOS and watched it growing up and again in syndication. Was it a good movie? Perhaps.

","Well, the Star Trek movie wasn't what we were expecting. (SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-My wife and I liked the actors who portrayed Kirk, Spock, and McCoy -- we could imagine them as younger versions without too much trouble. Much less so for Uhura, Checkov, Sulu, and especially Scotty.<br/><br/>-We liked a lot of the in jokes and back references. For instance, seeing how Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru, or Spock's hassles as a kid and his refusal to join the Vulcan Science Academy. How Kirk learns early (from Spock) to bait Spock when it suits his purpose. Spock's dad finally admitting that he loved Amanda. Iowa wild man farm boy.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-We didn't like the frenetic intercutting.<br/><br/>-We've all seen movies with gratuitous sex and violence. But gratuitous plumbing? The cargo bay was filled with pipes and that sequence with Scotty in the tubes was so dumb it was offensive. The whole Scotty-as-comedy-relief thing didn't work for us. Neither did his Star Wars sidekick.<br/><br/>-The young Spock was distinctly pink in close-ups, not green as his cupraglobin-based blood would make him.<br/><br/>-Physicists have long maintained that a black hole smaller than a pea could, if it intersected with a planet, collapse it to nothing in a matter of seconds. But such a black hole would have to have the mass of 100 planets, so a ship with malicious intent would have to be able to tow 100 planets worth of mass. And of course the ship would be sucked up too. The business of drilling a hole was nonsense. A black hole would sink through bedrock far more easily than a knife cuts through soft butter.<br/><br/>-The transporter effect reminded me of a silkworm cocoon. Everybody knows transporters don't work like that.<br/><br/>-No Star Fleet officer would strand another on an arctic planet. Especially not on Delta Vega, a desolate planet near the edge of the galaxy, containing only a lithium cracking station. (This is used to manufacture the dilithium crystals that moderate the flow of power from the warp drive antimatter converters). Oh, but wait, this is a different Delta Vega, one that just happens to be in orbit around 40 Eridani, close to Vulcan.<br/><br/>-Star Fleet vehicles do not burn 10-foot-deep holes into ice when they land.<br/><br/>-Spock and Uhura? Come on -- Spock is only interested in romance every seven years.<br/><br/>-I was perhaps most offended by the bad guy's ship. Everybody knows you can't have warp drive without separating the engine's nacelles from the rest of the ship, since they produce toxic radiation while in use. This ship, with its absurdly non-functional pointy barbs and no nacelles, should win the Silliest Starship award. The Romulans make nice starships. They wouldn't make a ship that looks like a porcupine.<br/><br/>-And speaking of Romulans, since they share relatively recent common ancestry with the Vulcans, they look like Vulcans. They don't look like Vin Diesel and tattoo themselves like 21st century rogue bikers.<br/><br/>-A green Orion slave girl as a cadet at Star Fleet? They hadn't yet been emancipated.<br/><br/>-Red matter? Looks like blood, and is removed with a huge hypodermic? Get real!<br/><br/>-Spock's ""pinwheel ship""? Who would design a ship to spin around as it flew? What were they thinking???<br/><br/>-Slow-moving, easily destroyed missiles launched from the Romulan porcupine ship? More nonsense! The Romulans had a very formidable plasma weapon at that time.<br/><br/>-The Enterprise didn't look right, or sound right.<br/><br/>-The Enterprise was on a five year mission in the original series, three years of which were (presumably) covered by the original three years of shows. This means that somehow in the first two years the crew went from being fresh-faced cadets to mature travelers.<br/><br/>In summary, this was a comic book, not a drama. We were deeply offended. We've seen the future and we know what it's like. And don't give us any of that alternate timeline crap, we know better.<br/><br/>This is somewhat tongue and cheek, but we really were disappointed."

","Sirs: I so much wanted to like, no, love this movie.<br/><br/>Instead, without giving away too many spoilers (there are a few here), it was simply awful. What Paramount delivered was an ADHD addled mess; one that completely destroys the source material from which it came. I understand that for the uninitiated, they (Abram's and company) can do what they like; and they have done so, I believe, for the sole purpose to be able to 'dumbly go where no worse hack writers have gone before' and henceforth dish out more tripe in the name of Star Trek while absolutely violating over 40 years of franchise history. You can laugh at that, and tell me to get a life, but if you are going to put the name of 'Star Trek' on a film, you need to do damn well better, and stay light years truer, than this crap. 'Superman Returns' certainly accomplished that.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd say this, but the Sci-Fi channel's ill advised 'Battlestar Galactica' was far more honest to its source material than Abram's 'Star Trek'. What he did was to truly steal a known identity, and then produce a bird cage liner that has almost nothing in common with that identity past the title, and the names of the characters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this 56 year old Trekker was all too easily able to follow the entire non-plot and action. The dialog overlap was 100% techno-babble predictable. A Power-Ranger's bred child could follow this simplistic 'must fight bad man' drivel.<br/><br/>The story was lame, and I believe that Orci and Kurtzman's claims to be fans of the show are outright lies; meant only as a weak attempt to deflect the flood of criticism they so richly deserve. They followed the beaten down, grossly overused, time travel path that Brannon Braga used to eventually kill the TV franchise.<br/><br/>Romulans??? In THIS time line so readily recognized by the Federation? A Chekov that was even sillier sounding than the original? And if one were to 'allow' the events of this misbegotten movie to be accepted, it would quite literally wipe out ALL of the subsequent 'known' Star Trek events, with the exception of the Enterprise series.<br/><br/>RED matter??? Oh my God, I can see them sitting around a table saying, ""Well, we can't use anti-matter, they'd never believe that one, and maybe even Dark Matter would be laughed at today, if we tried to use it as we intend... I'VE GOT IT! We'll call it RED MATTER! No one's EVER used that one! So we can carry a big blob of it around, extract a drop with a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE, and STILL use it to cause a Singularity and a subsequent Black Hole! Yeah, THAT'S plausible, without us ever having to explain anything! Brilliant!"" I suspect that the only Star Trek these geniuses ever watched was the much maligned 'Alternative Factor' episode. This 'plot device' (this was so bad, even Clarke's Third Law can not provide cover for it) is totally unbelievable, even when compared to a warp driven star ship. This is the kind of science fiction that a sixth grader writes. Come to think of it, I am probably insulting the intelligence of sixth graders everywhere. Watch for Blue Matter to follow in the next installment.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, this is not an 'alternative timeline' to free them from Canon, this is just an excuse to be able to avoid any accountability to 40 plus years of established 'Star Trek'. This is lazy, sloppy, and weak writing all rolled into one colossal middle finger brazenly extended to Star Trek fandom.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing worthy about this movie was the exterior of the Enterprise itself. It was truly beautiful; and the only piece here that stayed loyal to the original.<br/><br/>The rest is absolute zero worthless.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Dennis Carlson<br/><br/>Oh yeah, addendum: The biggest, worst, possibly most overlooked hole in this entirely stupid movie is the fact that if Nero DID somehow find himself back in time, after the destruction of his wife and home world, why didn't he simply use the opportunity to WARN the Romulan Empire, and the Federation, of what was going to happen, instead of going Postal? This is why Time Travel episodes suck, (Read same fault with Generations). Period. If I could have given this movie a Zero, I would have.<br/><br/>Last Add On, Promise:<br/><br/>1: For all of you who told us few naysayers to 'Get A Life', congratulations on your originality. <br/><br/>2: Yes, we know its just Fiction, and that our DVD's of the movies and series have not disappeared, but at least SOME of us yearn for at least a LITTLE continuity; something which this movie nearly completely destroys. This movie pulls a 'Dallas' 'It Was All A Dream' scam, and sorry, but some of us just don't buy it. Cheap, bad, writing. I'm pretty sure I'd laugh my butt off at the howls of protest from you JJ lovers, if the next movie restored the Star Trek time line as it should be, and rendered THIS travesty to the scrap heap where it belongs. You would scream at the repudiation of ONE movie, how do you think many of us feel about the refutation of nearly 40 YEARS of events, no matter how fictional? <br/><br/>3: And finally, to all of you who say that such extreme measures HAD to be done to revive the franchise, you are completely ignoring the fact that after the mediocre disappointment of 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture', that all it took to revive the franchise then, was to bring in a REAL Writer and Director, Nicholas Meyer, who crafted a superior movie WITHOUT (yes, I know about Chekov-Khan) trashing basic Trek 'history'."

","There was no way that this reboot was going to avoid all references to either the original series of Star Trek or the other spin-off series - anyone going in to see this film had to accept that as a given. But any cheesy bits (of which there were relatively few) are blown away by the sheer beauty and bravado of this film.<br/><br/>I was a fairly big Trekkie in my youth, but in the last 10 years only really kept up with it by watching a few new episodes here and there and seeing the big screen outings (OK, I admit that I have all 10 films on special edition DVD - £47 was a bargain!) - but Abrams' vision here has me thinking the new franchise will be even better than what has come before.<br/><br/>What made this film special for me was not the story (remarkably good, bearing in mind that, like the first film in any new franchise, it's backbone was character development). What made this film for me was the....photography? Can you even call CGI photography? Well, either way, this film was a visual feast. The way that scale was conveyed was breath-taking. I'm not sure whether I read this somewhere or if I can take credit for it myself, but the difference came in the way that Abrams shoved aside the traditional Star Trek view of Enterprise as a lumbering naval ship and took a more Star Wars-esquire dogfight approach. This has set a high standard for a new era of Star Trek that I hope will spawn at least a couple more films.<br/><br/>It's not that I wasn't impressed with the character development, the acting, the script or the story - it's just that this film looked so gorgeous that I haven't been able to think of anything else since I saw it last night! But sufficed to say, this was overall an excellent feature. It might not quite deserve a 100% rating, but it's worth more than 90% in my eyes - so, by rounding up, it gets 10/10 from me! Final warning: see this film in the cinema. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD. It. Will. Not. Do. It. Justice.<br/><br/>JJ, you've won a fan!"

From a 'supernova that threatens to destroy the galaxy' to a little drop of 'red matter' that's a- OK sitting in a jar on a table but somehow able to create a singularity, it's full of terribad buzzword science worse than anything scene in STNNG.<br/><br/>The acting and direction was more along the lines of a slapstick comedy at times, than what you expect in a sci-fi movie. From kirk's hands swelling up, to the silly willy wonka like chase of scotty through the water pipes, comedy in places it didn't beling. A stark contrast to the first Star Trek movie."
"Zaxzar","1","106","164","17 May 2009"," Trek fans avoid at all costs!
","First of all let me start out by saying I am a Trek fan. I love the original series. Not the kind of fan that knows everything that happened to everybody in every episode on every stardate type of fan, but a fan nonetheless. The last few movies were dull and I never even bothered to watch The Enterprise TV series. When I heard a new movie was in the works I was very happy. Once I heard JJ Abrams was directing my heart sank (still can't forgive him for what he turned Lost into).<br/><br/>First of all the plot is so full of holes the whole starfleet could fly through. Why is it that a cadet crew (some not even cadets yet) are the only ones who can save a planet or two? The movie relies too much on visual effects and too little on plot. The effects got boring after awhile. The time travel thing has been done and done so many times it's obvious the writers can't come up with new ideas. Even if we are to accept this is some alternate universe/timeline, it still doesn't explain how Chekhov aged so closely to Kirk. In the original series he was only 22 and Kirk in his 30's. In the original series no one knew what Romulans looked like or that they were similar to Vulcans, yet it's common knowledge in the film. None of the movie makes sense. You have to have a lack of imagination to truly enjoy this film. Leonard Nimoy doesn't even seem like his old character.<br/><br/>I saw this with both trek and non trek fans and everyone agreed it dragged on too long, was boring & they couldn't wait for it to be over. Star Trek needs to take another long rest and any future movies must not involve JJ Abrams. This is not Star Trek reimagined, it is Star Trek rewritten."

The whole thing with a time traveling ship, old idea. The evil aliens seeking revenge for an old or new wrong, also so old. The Enterprise barely reminded me of a Starship, more like a chemical plant with wings. I know that they are trying to be sci-fi, but at least put up the money to build something new. <br/><br/>The movie carried none of the flavor of any of the earlier movies. All the high ideals of exploration and morality are gone. Scratch that, some of the aliens are very cheesy. Actors wearing cheap makeup pretending to be aliens. It is almost comical in that respect. Add in the funny sound effects and the movie is more like a Starship Troopers Clone. They couldn't even get the plot line right, with the earlier movies and shows.<br/><br/>If you are one of those people who enjoyed the earlier films, like First Contact or maybe even The Undiscovered Country; don't waste your time or money on this film."

"AvonKerr","1","80","122","16 May 2009"," Rubbish
","The story is a pathetic amalgam of the ""big thing appears near earth"" story that has been used in at least three previous Treks, a bunch of scenes from the various TV series done worse and a load of filler that I think was shot by Michael Bay but he didn't want it because it was too stupid.<br/><br/>The actors who play the adult Kirk and Spock are both good if you ignore the story and script they have to work with. Both look the parts and carry them surprisingly well. The less said about their kid versions the better, but let's just say young Anakin looks a lot better in this light. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast are either horribly mis-cast (Simon Pegg), instantly forgettable or just plain horrible (Uhura). <br/><br/>By and large the action/sfx scenes reminded me mostly of the end of Armageddon - shiny drivel that makes you want to punch people in the neck. The first ten minutes epitomises this (slight spoiler but you won't miss anything, the film has no surprises in it) : teeny tiny research ship vs huge planet-killing machine from a vastly more advanced race AND 150 years in the future, the smaller ship is so boned by the first 5 seconds of the fight, during which the baddies don't even really try, that it's evacuated. It is then flown in a dead straight line at the enemy guns for about 90 seconds with no shields, no defences and no evasive manoeuvres. Despite this it is somehow unharmed and it's pilot manages to happily converse with his wife by radio while presumably the conversation aboard the enemy ship goes something like ""I think he's going to ram us sir"", ""oh?"", ""shall we do something?"", ""shoot wildly over his head"", ""yes sir""..... time passes.... ""he's still coming sir, very very slowly"", ""oh well shoot more just don't hit him that would spoil the moment"". I'm sure Futurama had almost this exact scene but it was a joke when they did it.....<br/><br/>It's this kind of lazy, tired, pathetic trash that I expected from Abrams and he delivers it in spades. The whole film is saturated with laziness from top to bottom. Given that the Trek franchise invented and then flogged to death most of the great clichés of sci-fi you might think this is all just tongue-in-cheek homage but it really isn't, this is the best this hackneyed joke of a director has to offer and you can tell he honestly thinks it doesn't stink. The pinnacle of this laziness has to be ""Red matter"" which is probably the worst McGuffin in the history of cinema. Oh yes and let's not forget that the entire plot hinges on the premise that Spock (something of an icon for learning) has never heard of ""velocity equals distance over time"". <br/><br/>All of this is from a purely non-Trek perspective. I could point out no end of issues on that front (Cardassians in Kirk's era, Ships built on the surface of the planet, everything about Pike, one of the most advanced species in the galaxy defeated by a ship whose main weapon is a 10 mile long undefended phallus which takes a week to shoot it's load, etc. etc. etc.)."

","I was actually glad to see some of the negative reactions here, because I thought I might be alone in my dislike for this movie.<br/><br/>Everyone around me at the premier seemed to be cheering. But I just felt a little sick inside.<br/><br/>As one reviewer said, Trek was at its best when it expected an audience to think. Not to just switch off their brains and enjoy the pretty explosions. This isn't ""Independence Day"", for crying out loud.<br/><br/>There are dozens of problems with the movie, but the biggest one is the script. I'll say this for the actors. They all tried very hard, and they really put a lot of effort into it. Good on them.<br/><br/>But the script and the story are just ... awful. Dumb. With plot holes so large I could fly a ship through them.<br/><br/>There's problems with the sense of scale. The writers don't seem to realise how big space is. Travelling at warp speeds, and being able to stop on a proverbial dime. Shooting a capsule down to a planet, and randomly finding the one person within walking distance of its landing spot.<br/><br/>And scenes like monster1 chasing our hero, only to see it chomped by larger monster2, means that you think ripping off George Lucas's ""Phantom Menace"" is probably a good idea.<br/><br/>For those who *really* like their Trek, (and by that, I mean the sort of people who know what's involved in ship to ship warp-transports, and what the maximum range of a transporter is in the 24th century) there'll be even more to drive you nuts. If you were the sort of person who watched Generations and said ""Just dump the warp core! WTF?"" you'll probably have more problems than I can mention here.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie is the ultimate reset button. (Something I never liked in the series, where it was usually used in Voyager). If you like your comics, you might know what I mean when I say, this is Star Treks ""Brand New Day"".<br/><br/>Personally, I think this is the last Trek movie."

They no longer have to worry about anything in the series (no tribbles)or the movies(no Khan). They hit one giant reset button. The time line has been changed the only Star Trek that is safe, is ""Enterprise"". Yippie. Besides from that, what is up with all the characters being the same age?

","Arrogance, ignorance and disrespect are writ large in this abominable film which, with its cynical use of time-travel, does two unforgivable things. <br/><br/>In one fell swoop it destroys all other Star Trek stories and histories (apart from the predated last TV series Enterprise). IT ALL NEVER HAPPENED...nada...zip...niente...all absolutely and completely and irrevocably nullified. <br/><br/>And having thus performed genocide, from here on in it allows this cabal of contemptuous filmmakers to commit further evil against the Star Trek characters and their universe, totally unfettered by Star Trek, as we know it. The Star Trek they are cannibalising only continues to exist today because devoted fans have - for over forty years - lovingly burnished and enhanced the patina of this pop culture treasure.<br/><br/>Within the real Star Trek universe, respect for the time-line is a key ethical principle for the Federation and its officers. The forces that have brought the world this film are unburdened by ethics of any kind. It is not surprising then, to find that while they use time-travel to sack, rape and pillage Star Trek, they are unwilling or unable to carry it out to its logical conclusions.<br/><br/>At the very least, from the moment of the destruction of Vulcan (in itself a breathtaking and staggering insolence by the filmmakers), Ambassador Spock, Nero and their ships would have ceased to exist in the current time-line because the future events that led to their being there would not have occurred. No planet Vulcan, no Vulcan Science Academy, no Spock's ship with its enormous load of 'red matter', no failed rescue mission for Ambassador Spock, no avenging Nero, no ridiculous black hole/wormhole to the time and place of Kirk's birth etc.<br/><br/>This is not a parallel universe story. This is a changed timeline. Although the Temporal Prime Directive is still hundreds of years hence in the Star Trek canon, this is exactly what it seeks to prevent.<br/><br/>So it's all a con. This is not Star Trek. A bunch of bully-boys have invaded the playing field, rewritten the rules of the game to suit themselves and then refused to even abide by their own rules. On the back of the commercial success of this movie, they will continue to do what they please, churning out movies in their new franchise, but it won't be Star Trek. They don't know what made Star Trek great and they are therefore doomed to twist and distort its corpse until it becomes obvious to all who care to think about that it's dead and lifeless and that this movie killed it."
"nazgul_v","4","37","53","5 June 2009"," Star Trek? More like more contemporary Hollywood drivel eagerly lapped up by lowest common denominator
","There are lots of points to make regarding this film. 1) The casting was superb, only Uhura's character was pretty shallow and was never really explored. 2) I'm a professional video editor and I've seen many great movies and I can honestly say that this movie has one of the most number of cuts in it I have ever seen. Consequently the directing never shines. The average duration of one shot must be like 3 seconds? If someone is sad enough to count the cuts then it could be worked out ;-) <br/><br/>The effect of this is audience separation, lack of engagement with the plot or characters, the 'masses' may have been impressed by flashing images but anyone with a bit of intelligence will have felt something lacking. I personally felt sick after seeing the film, it has accelerated modern pace to now 'epileptic' proportions. I guess its a reflection of society, because people can't sit still or focus for 3 seconds without realising how boring and insignificant their own lives really are. Take my advice, chill out a bit more.<br/><br/>3) I liked the colourfulness of the battle scenes and the angles used, definitely gave it new life there, but it didn't really manage to disguise the level of CG. The Star Trek movies 1-8 used models as the basis for effects, although this film did better than other contemporaries its still noticeable. I'd prefer a juicy fly-by of a cg enhanced model to a cartoon any day. You can't beat the destruction of the Enterprise in ST3 or the flyby of the spanking new Enterprise E in first contact. Mouthwatering and powerful, instead of thin and annoying.<br/><br/>4) I felt this 'Star Trek' film downgraded the content so that there was nothing profound or intelligent to take home with you, no message. A fundamental error of any film, and certainly of a Star Trek film or episode as this was the basis for all of the good ones. And yes I do think Nemesis and Insurrection were lacking in this too, however they did at least attempt to pay homage to intelligence. This film is more concerned with appealing to all the family like a George Lucas movie, than actually providing anything memorable.<br/><br/>5) The film features time-travel as the convenient plot device which I dislike, its just lazy. The older Trek did use time travel but in a minority, where as the later trend of star trek (a very bad one) in voyager and enterprise was non-stop time travel.<br/><br/>6) The film sets up a new premise for a new series for new fans, and I'm all for this. I want new people to like it. I just won't be a part of it, I'll keep watching the old stuff (there's plenty of it!). However I actually believe that this film is too shallow to have any enduring or lasting appeal, and the masses will not follow it with any loyalty at all.<br/><br/>7)Some child-like elements (little kid drives car fast without parents permission), Disney elements (kirk turns into a cg monster human WTF??) and product placement (Nokia) confirmed how moral-less and banal this film was.<br/><br/>8)The bad guy was mean, Eric Bana is cool, but he didn't have enough screen time to be truly believed.<br/><br/>9)I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, except Leonard Nimoy and thats just cos he was in the movie. I felt for him I really did.<br/><br/>10) There were too many distractions to what could have been a good solid movie.<br/><br/>11) It was good for kids, I think it would inspire my nephews.<br/><br/>12) Regarding the director, I personally think Lost is a big waste of yours and my time, engineered to hook you without ever telling you anything worth knowing. Much like this film. If we spent our time creatively, something might actually be achieved (the spirit of Star Trek).<br/><br/>Conclusion: It was a money-spinner that raped the Star Trek name for a bit of cash, in good old Hollywood style. it might leave a few new fans in its wake, but an even worse sequel is sure to nip that in the bud. The fact that the rating is so high for this movie is due to something I like to call 'The Retard Factor' (should be an episode?). The only way forward for people who actually like Star Trek (and not star wars) is for they themselves to make a film."

","For the record, I should have stuck to my guns. But I didn't. I caught J.J. Abrams' Star Trek (from here on out to be known as Abramstrek, for brevity's sake) a few days back. By the time it was over, I knew that the universe had changed.<br/><br/>Abrams said he was creating a film that was entertaining, and true to his word, it is. From the initial scenes of the massive Romulan ship appearing and spawning an alternate timeline (this is not a spoiler, this happens two minutes into the film. Spoilers ahead though, be warned) when it engages in a fierce battle with a clearly more archaic Federation vessel, to the final scenes with a triumphant Captain James T. Kirk at the helm of his (way too shiny) Enterprise, this blockbuster is most definitely entertaining.<br/><br/>It's just not Star Trek.<br/><br/>A good portion of the audience applauded at the end of the film. The group I went with all enjoyed it (ages 10, 18 and 55. Definitely the target audience) I even found myself enjoying it. But just as the re-launch of Lost in Space (the film I was most reminded of viewing this one) redefined (in a good way, in my opinion) what Lost in Space was about, Abramstrek has redefined what Star Trek is about, and something significant has been lost in translation.<br/><br/>It isn't a problem with the cast, they all performed admirably. It isn't a problem with the dialog, a good portion of which seemed to be lifted word for word from previous episodes and movies. I think the problem is that Star Trek has always been more than just entertainment to me (no matter how many times I repeated the mantra ""it's just entertainment, don't take it seriously"") and to see it ""dumbed down"" to the level of blockbuster entertainment (a process started several films ago) leaves me feeling a bit hollow.<br/><br/>I find myself at a loss now. Unlike many fans, I'm not insulted by the content of the film. I just can't grasp what it is that the vast majority of the fans and viewing public see in the film. It's first weekend returns exceeded all other Star Trek films to date, even adjusted for inflation.<br/><br/>I've read dozens of posts in support of the film on Trekbbs. Fans are dragging their friends out to watch it; in much the same fashion as if the average American needs to be convinced to chew bubblegum. Abramstrek is bubblegum. I don't see the point in promoting bubblegum; people will chew it anyway.<br/><br/>No, I don't like the film. If you really want to know why read through...<br/><br/>!Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>Paramount finally gets it's way and removes those pesky Vulcans that are so hard to understand and write for (logic, what's that?) by having Vulcan destroyed by an artificially generated black hole (the explanation for which would be technobabble, had they only attempted to explain it) thus insuring that the only Vulcan they will have to write parts for in the future is the half-Vulcan Mr. Spock, who seems to have a lot more trouble restraining emotion in this universe.<br/><br/>Uhura in essence sleeps her way onto the bridge of the Enterprise by having a relationship with Mr. Spock, who is not only one of her professors, but also a superior officer. The moral issues of this arrangement are never questioned, leading me to wonder if we haven't somehow stumbled into the Mirror, Mirror universe (Sylar, is that you?) where that type of behavior is run of the mill.<br/><br/>James T. Kirk becomes captain of the Enterprise largely influenced by the career of his father. In this alternate timeline, the now fatherless Kirk (dad being killed in the opening sequence of the film. The com conversation between the two parents, as George Kirk is about to be killed, being one of the silliest parts of the film) still becomes captain of the Enterprise; proving the modern belief that fathers are irrelevant in the scheme of things, and can be disposed of with no ill effects for any required plot device.<br/><br/>Then there's the running gag of Bones McCoy infecting the recently reprimanded Kirk with a mock disease in order to smuggle him on the Enterprise. This leads to a subsequent series of injections in order to cure him of humorous side effects. Or the transwarp beaming accident that leaves the recently found Scotty floating in engine coolant until conveniently rescued by Kirk through an inexplicably placed access hatch in the coolant tube. both situations so clearly contrived as to almost be cringe-level uncomfortable for me.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I won't.<br/><br/>!End Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder what Leonard Nimoy (whom I will hold blameless) saw in this film to recommend his tacit approval and his venerable image to it. Spock prime stands in sharp contrast to the new cast, carrying with him into history a mantle of respect this revisioined Star Trek will never achieve. Because unlike Star Trek and it's 42 years of history, Abramstrek is just entertainment.<br/><br/>With this film, Paramount can pat itself on the back for finally successfully milking this franchise the way it wanted to when the property was acquired with Desilu Productions. Like so many entertainment properties (Lost in Space, the Brady Bunch, Bewitched, the Flintstones, etc.) before it, sucked dry of nostalgia dollars, Star Trek can be safely shelved in long term storage, probably never to be heard from again.<br/><br/>If there is any mercy in this Mirror, Mirror universe, it won't be. Rest In Peace Star Trek. Say hi to Gene for me."

The actors and action were convincing and good, but the problem with Star Trek is, that if the writers can't come up with something they just use time travel to make there story fit. And this time they didn't even care, that they destroyed the complete canon with it. For example: With Vulcan destroyed, there will never be this famous duel from the classic show between Kirk and Spock.<br/><br/>But maybe the franchise is really dead and the writers just don't care anymore.

That uniquely American perspective coupled with the tiresome oversexualization or alternatively, casting-into-comedic roles of every single character, followed by constant mindless action sequences drags the script of this movie below the Canned-Tuna quality we see in all the Star Wars prequels. It even comes complete with hoverbikes and giant digitized monster chases.<br/><br/>What happened to the cerebral and highly character-driven plots that Star Trek has come to be known for? Why pollute an otherwise acceptable premise with silly fantasy elements and spoil a carefully thought out universe with a tired old Deus Ex Machina like time travel through black holes?

","Spoiler alert: There's big red goo that you really shouldn't know about, and lots more below. So there, you've been warned.<br/><br/>After seeing this flick in IMAX last night, I knew I felt uneasy (and it wasn't just the random chunk of dirt being projected onto the huge screen) but I had to sleep on this one.<br/><br/>Many of the original Star Trek episodes were written by the leading science fiction authors of the time, and they dealt with issues like geopolitics, arms race, cultural divide, and, yes, even some science.<br/><br/>This film was brought to you by the guy who brought us that hopelessly lost TV show Lost.<br/><br/>During the movie, all I could see in my mind's eye was the writers' meetings.<br/><br/>""We need something that can blow-up a planet. Trekkies know that Spock planet, right ? Pon Far, I saw it last night on the old Trek DVDs they forced me to watch. Let's blow it up !"" <br/><br/>""How about a black hole, boss..."" <br/><br/>""Perfect. Now we need something to make a black hole."" <br/><br/>""Well, scientists have speculated on something called Dark Matter..."" <br/><br/>""Dark ? We're making a movie here. Make it red ! A huge red ball of goo."" <br/><br/>Sure, it could be said that the Genesis Device in Wrath of Khan was a similar dramatic device, but at least they properly set that one up for those of us who aren't so willing to suspend disbelief when watching sci-fi.<br/><br/>Later, my mind reeled back to the conference room when it seemed that Abrams was shoehorning Nimoy and the Scotty character into the kludgey red sludge of a movie: <br/><br/>""OK how about Spock shoots Kirk onto an ice planet with big ice monsters, and old Spock happens to be in a cave waiting there to help him out."" <br/><br/>""Umm, OK boss..."" <br/><br/>""And then they walk down the hill and there's a Federation station, and they meet Scotty there. Why is Scotty there..."" <br/><br/>""How about he transported an Admiral's dog into space doing an experiment ?"" <br/><br/>""Perfect ! PETA won't even notice. Oh and throw an Ewok onto the station."" <br/><br/>""But boss that's the wrong..."" <br/><br/>""Do it ! OK now onto Earth. Great job guys, we're almost done and we've left a pile of plot holes for the next movies to deal with, muhahaha !"" <br/><br/>Was it worth watching ? Maybe, I need to see it again in the comfort of my living room to figure that one out (my screen might not be 4 stories high but my projector doesn't have any dead pixels or flecks of dirt to constantly distract). But so far I think I've just witnessed Star Trek for Dummies meets those 80s albums where kids sang rock songs, and I'm pretty sure neither of those are up my alley."

But not the way you think.<br/><br/>{from ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?""}<br/><br/>This movie didn't have an extended title; it was just Star Trek. But I have some ideas for an extended title:<br/><br/>""The Unreal McCoy""<br/><br/>""Bad Robot Poops On Star Trek""<br/><br/>""Let's Pervert Star Trek To Appease Teenagers""<br/><br/>""Abrams Pilots Star Trek Over The Shark""<br/><br/>I have been a Star Trek fan for 42 years. I have seen every Star Trek story made for the movie screen and TV screen (including the animated series). This was one of the worst Star Trek stories I ever saw.<br/><br/>It was not necessary to ""reboot"" Star Trek. It was not necessary to change the Enterprise. It was not necessary for Spock and Uhura to have the hots for each other. It was not necessary to destroy Vulcan. It was not necessary to kill Amanda, although it was necessary to remove Winona Ryder from the movie.<br/><br/>There are good parts of the movie. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, who accepted the enormous challenges of playing Kirk and Spock, performed very well. Ben Cross, as Sarek, proved my belief that he would be a good Vulcan. The visual effects were very good, as I would expect from ILM.<br/><br/>However, the many changes in Star Trek history were unjustified. These changes can't be glossed over by saying, ""It's obviously an alternate-universe story."" That wasn't firmly established in the movie. (There is a difference between alternate-universe and alternate-timeline.) What I saw was J.J. Abrams, Robert Orci, and Alex Kurtzman rewriting Star Trek in a shameless attempt to attract young airheads who wouldn't care about Star Trek anyway.<br/><br/>The absurd design of the ""new"" Enterprise only reminded me of how beautiful the original NCC-1701 was. The ""new"" Bridge looked like a disco. The ""new"" Engineering areas looked like an oil refinery.<br/><br/>The other members of the new cast were mostly disappointing. Zoe Saldana is a lovely lady, but she couldn't carry Nichelle Nichols' boots. Karl Urban's performance almost was a parody of McCoy; he only reminded me of how much I miss DeForest Kelley. John Cho won't make me forget George Takei. Anton Yelchin made Chekov almost irritating. And Simon Pegg almost turned Scotty into the Court Jester (and why did they include that pint-size rockface? Is he the Jar Jar Binks of Star Trek?).<br/><br/>Kirk's rapid promotion also was absurd. No matter how good a young officer is, no one rises from Cadet to Captain that fast.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was forgettable. (I've already forgotten it.)<br/><br/>Obviously, nitpickers would go ape over this movie. The star dates - in the 2200s - would set this story in the first season of The Original Series (TOS), long after Kirk became Captain. Delta Vega was moved from the edge of the galaxy to next to Vulcan. The uniforms, like the ""new"" Enterprise, don't jibe with TOS or ""The Cage."" (They looked like cheap knockoffs I would find in a costume shop.) And how can the Kelvin carry 800 people?<br/><br/>If this was an alternate-universe story, then I hope we never return. I wouldn't mind seeing this young cast in another Star Trek movie, but I would want that movie to return us to this universe, where the Enterprise looks like the NCC-1701 of TOS, Vulcan still exists, and Amanda lives (and is not played by Winona Ryder). But I also believe this is too much to ask.<br/><br/>This ""reboot"" probably will be very popular with young movie fans. Thus, it might be the template for future Star Trek movies, in which we'll probably see more changes in Star Trek history. But no matter how popular this ""rebooted"" Star Trek becomes, it's no substitute for TOS or any other Star Trek series. If this is the only option for continuing Star Trek, then let the franchise die with some dignity."

","Like everything in this world, it seems we are all in a mad dash to dumb down everything for 5th grade comprehension. I'm sorry but there is no way this movie deserves any praise. The story line literally was just one 1 billion to 1 probability after another. The motivating reason behind the bad guys actions were sophomoric. The whole storyline from beginning to end was impossible to believe possible.<br/><br/>First off scotty, spock, and jim all end up on the same planet by accident. The bad guy, whatever his name was, was motivated by an event spock had no control over and was trying to prevent. ""Jim"" was just a prick, not cool, and no one in there right mind would give him control of a star ship acting like that. LOL. Absurd, Absurd, Absurd.<br/><br/>Really, A cartoon has deeper and more coherent plot lines.<br/><br/>This movie is a joke, appealing to those that enjoy visual effects, and big explosions, that's all you'll get, if that is what you want, this is the movie for you, if you want something with a better storyline than ""See Spot Run"", save the gas."

She looks like her character Abigail Williams from ""The Crucible"", what with her cloak and bad age-makeup. Apparently Abigail fled Salem and ended up on Vulcan...<br/><br/>The plot is doesn't make sense and relies too much on coincidences. Supernovas threatening galaxies, black holes that act as worm holes, it doesn't make scientific sense at all. And what's with Uhura making out with Spock, not once but twice, second time in full view of other crew members! The scene where Captain Kirk feels the need to blast Nero even though a black hole's engulfing his ship was so not like Star Trek's values. What happened to humanistic values? Nero was going to die, his ship had a black hole in it, they should have just let the black hole deal with him. I really didn't understand the business of offering help to an enemy near death, then when the enemy rejects it, fires at said defenseless enemy.<br/><br/>All in all, great effects, but the core of Star Trek is gone."
"heidi-goldberg","4","88","137","10 May 2009"," This movie is stupid!
","**Spoiler alert** Yes, I mean it. I'm glad i saw it at a free advance screening and didn't have to actually pay for it. That would be 8 dollars down the drain.<br/><br/>If you like your movies to assault you into submission through cinematic shock and awe, or you like shallow eye candy, then this is the one for you because that's all it is. Just one gigantic special effect after another tied together by writing gimmicks, contrivances, and clichés. What little plot exists is thoughtless and senseless. Old Spock and the villains time travel from the 24th Century back to the 23rd through a black hole (black holes don't work that way) and create an alternate reality where Star Trek history is changed. Why??? If the writers wanted the freedom to retell Star Trek, why didn't they just re-imagine it like what was done with Battlestar Galactica? It was completely unnecessary, except to give Leonard Nimoy an excuse for being in it. The writing is bad, lazy, or both.<br/><br/>We're supposed to believe that Kirk joins Starfleet at Captain Pike's request because Pike watched him _lose_ a bar fight and decided Kirk would make a great captain one day? And believe that after Spock kicks Kirk off the Enterprise, he just happens to land on the very planet where old Spock and Scotty are?? And they help Kirk transport back to the Enterprise even after it's long gone from the system??? And Kirk gets promoted straight to captain from cadet, skipping three ranks, based on this shoddy story???? What????? There's hardly any character development, just a quick rush to get all the main characters together as quickly as possible. Kirk grows up without a father because he died in battle. The movie shows almost nothing about how that affected his growth, so there's no insight into his motivations for joining Starfleet, and therefore no reason to care about him. With Spock, you get slightly more back story, such as family interaction, but not much. The destruction of Vulcan is an example of shock and awe mentioned above, and serves no other purpose except to look cool. We don't learn enough about Spock or Vulcan to care that it's gone. Kirk and McCoy supposedly become friends at the Academy, but we never see this friendship develop so we have no reason to care about it, either. As for Scott, Sulu, Chekov, and Uhura, they're plot devices, not full characters, who drive forward what little plot there is. Uhura does get to take off her clothes and make out with Spock, so she offers some fan-service.<br/><br/>The action sequences are weak and consist of Kirk hanging off the edge of very high objects by his fingers not once, but three times while villains loom over him! Fight sequences are poorly choreographed and poorly filmed.<br/><br/>Star Trek is supposed to be science fiction, but it's chock full of bad, outdated science and fake science. I hate technobabble and was glad the writers jettisoned it, but they also threw basic science out the window with it.<br/><br/>I haven't over-analyzed the movie. I realized it was stupid as I was watching it, but I'm just as susceptible to shock and awe as every other human being on earth. Once the initial euphoria wore off the day after I saw it, I knew I'd been had.<br/><br/>I rated it generously with 4 stars instead of 1 because the cast is good. Unfortunately, they were given bad material to work with.<br/><br/>If you're going to see it just for Simon Pegg, he's in it for around 20 minutes only. Save your money and wait for the DVD."

","My precognition kicked in because I grabbed a paper napkin from the popcorn buttering station before I went in. I rolled it into a tight cylinder, tore off two inch long pieces, and stuck them in my ears. Thank goodness I did that, because most of the soundtrack is running at 110-130 decibels. I did like the nostalgia of seeing representations of the original cast as younger people. While Kirk, Spock, and McCoy looked a fair amount like the originals, Chekov, Sulu, Scotty, and Spock's father didn't resemble the first actors. Ohura, didn't look too much like the original, but she was beautiful enough that I could forgive them that.<br/><br/>The story was flaky and dumb - far too much of the shoot-em-up and protracted car chase mentality. I got really tired of the already way overdone cliché of the hero hanging over a precipice by his fingertips, so it was nauseating to put Kirk in that situation FOUR, count 'em, four times in the movie, starting as a little boy, and then with a villain trying to stomp on his fingers in two of those episodes.<br/><br/>Far too much noise, far too much repetition, quite a few inconsistencies with the original story situations, more fantasy and less Si-Fi.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the next in the series only if they get rid of the two writers who did this one."
"mytrini","4","46","68","10 May 2009"," Star Trek for Generation Y
","Here's the sitch, I'm 40 years old. I grew up with the Shatner and Nimoy universe of Star Trek and loved most of the movie outings they did. I was also a fan of Next Gen and Deep Space Nine, although Voyager and Enterprise, not so much. So I have to say, I wasn't really sold on this version. Being honest, if I hadn't known any previous versions of Star Trek and came at it with fresh eyes, I probably would have loved it. But age and previous knowledge (and love) of Star Trek Lore has probably tainted my view and overall enjoyment of this movie.<br/><br/>I have to say, yes to the action sequences but no to the young 90210 crew and Melrose Place situations. When they said that this was a ""reboot"", I didn't realize they meant it so literally and I guess that in some way exonerates this version and how the events unfold in the movie. In retrospect, probably the only way they could have gone. I did find the story to be weak and the attention to detail in regards to ""real world"" science (which the original universe was noted for), very lacking. I'm not sure how realistic it is to promote a cadet to first officer over other already serving commissioned officers. Having Checkov and Scotty as comical characters also didn't work for me but the Kirk/Spock/McCoy characters were pretty good.<br/><br/>For the sheer grandioseness of the action and effects, it may be worth going to see this movie. Some of the sets didn't work for me though, especially engineering, which looked like it was shot on the inside of a massive steel mill or pipe works.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say ""if you were a fan of the original, you will be disappointed"", because I am sure there are some die-hard Trekkers out there that probably loved this version. So I don't want to stop anyone out there from going to see it. My personal opinion, I was disappointed in this ""reboot"". My advice to Trekkers is to go in with an open mind. Any previous knowledge of Star Trek Lore needs to be forgotten (which I had trouble doing), to truly enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>This is definitely a Star Trek for the next generation and a parallel universe that I probably won't be participating in again."
"Arashikage2","1","57","86","16 May 2009"," Bad movie yes. But not because of what everyone else say.
","Maybe I'm wrong. I just type what I think. Here it is:<br/><br/>One conversation between Picard and data or Kirk and Spock is more insightful and thought provoking than all American movies produced for the last eight years. Since 9/11 directors are not allowed to make smart movies any more. Actually they only make propaganda films like in world war 2. But the problem is that those films are smart and thought provoking and inspire people even today. <br/><br/>Some powerful people are making the job of their enemies for them. Making the American people dumper. How can anyone believe that Kirk's actions would earn him something other than a kick out of the academy in any reality that such a benevolent institution exist? How can someone abandon a crew mate on a frozen monster infested planet. How can someone linger next to a black hole and fire all weapons on a dying ship endangering his own ship? Because it looks cool? It that what they want to teach? If American boys go to war with mentality like that will they accomplice anything? They'll just going to get killed. Actually all the characters are petty and cruel and act stupidly. Even the last security guard. Is J.J. Abrams that dump? No. he is told to make it that way.<br/><br/>You think that J.J. does not know that the Romulans can warn their people in the past or does not know all the other unbelievable plot holes? He made the movie. And to be fair all of Star Trek had huge plot holes most of all TOS. The plot was always the means to make a philosophical or technological point. Witch here is obviously non existent.<br/><br/>Just like The Vulcan councilman insults his best student (Spock) in front of everybody with no reason and loses him that is how they insult the audience with no reason and loose them.<br/><br/>The point is propaganda films don't need to be stupid and sure as heck don't need to be stupid when they are based on Star Trek. How can you help people protect them selves from terrorist or any treats? By making them dumper and scared or smart and informed?<br/><br/>This is not Star Trek don't compare it with Star Trek. Its nothing. Only Gene Roddenberry can make star trek and he is dead. what he made he made and that is Star Trek.<br/><br/>But there is a good think to come out of it. Peoples attention will be drawn to the Real Star Trek and maybe they'll learn something.<br/><br/>And if you materialize in a sealed tube filed with water you will die. It is worse than materializing in a wall."
"mje2k","2","41","60","29 May 2009"," To boldly go , and destroy a 40 year franchise
","On Friday May 22 2009 I went to the Detroit Science Center and saw the traveling Star Trek exhibit. I was never a fan as a kid but recently I have started watching Star Trek in chronological order according to the canon/time line of the franchise beginning with Enterprise. I have really enjoyed it. The exhibit at the Science Center was terrific, complete with mock ups of the bridge, actual costumes and props from each show, the works.<br/><br/>A few days later I went and saw the new Star Trek. I liked it to a point, and then Spock's mother dies when Vulcan is destroyed, the use of an alternate time line came into play and everything Gene Roddenberry, Shatner, Nimoy and the generations that came after them put on screen, was made null and void.<br/><br/>Kirk is a young rebel rouser from Iowa who in a matter of moments it seems is recruited into Star Fleet and through a 'just happened to be there at the right time' scenario, is put in charge of the Enterprise. Gone is a story about how a young officer worked his way up the ranks at Star Fleet to achieve his later success. Instead we see a bar room brawler who takes command of NCC - 1701 by means of a hurried and contrived plot.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams made no attempt to make the Enterprise look anything like it did in 1967, he has publicly stated he has never sen Star Trek and that is fairly obvious from this over done film. JJ Abrams gave us 'Lost' and with all of the shaky camera work in this film I expected Ben Linus and the smoke monster to appear at any time.<br/><br/>I know the film was made for the short attention spans of today's audiences but some respect for Star Trek fans would have helped. One reviewer stated that the bridge of the Enterprise looked like a perfume counter at the mall, I couldn't agree more. The characters gratuitously speak their famous catch phrases to remind us that we're still watching a Star Trek film. We see Uhura and Spock have romantic scenes together and we see Kirk hiding under a bed in Uhura's room at Starfleet and both are in their underwear. Was this really necessary? The special effects were good yet typically overdone as always in today's movies. The characters were too amped up and the story never took time for the quieter moments that made the original Star Trek great. All of the people involved in the original Star Trek, who have since passed on, are probably rolling in their graves.<br/><br/>The original Star Trek was only on the air for three years but has since become a legend. Sure it was campy and you saw the fake rocks and the zippers in the aliens costumes, but it deserves more respect than the treatment given by JJ Abrams.<br/><br/>At the Detroit Science Center they had a, wall length, display of the entire franchise in chronological order from Enterprise to the current fiasco. Much was on display of characters and plot points. At the very end of the display was this new movie. All it had written by it was 'The adventure continues.' After seeing this new film, I certainly hope not."
"atoothbrush","2","36","52","3 January 2016"," loud, fast and dumb
","Where to begin. How to compare the reboot to original trek and whether to compare it to TNG?<br/><br/>Firstly, what made trek trek? Above all, star trek had at its core a humanistic theme and vision. It was often a story of how to tackle 1 or 2 specific current day issues without the pragmatic constraints of our current day world. It was often hopelessly idealistically naive (from our point of view) but always thought provoking and sometimes (mainstream) ground-breaking. This is what set the star trek franchise apart from generic sci-fi and space adventure like Star Wars.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie utterly failed to capture that essence of trek.<br/><br/>The first 20 mins of opening sequence are a beautiful and somewhat emotional alternate/new back-story to Captain Kirk. If all the movie were like this it would get 9 or 10 stars from me. From there on however this movie primarily trades on nostalgia quotes and references in-between modern cgi explosions and fisticuffs. By the middle of the movie this is starting to wear thin and you are starting to notice the omnipresent lens-flares. A pointless scene shot in an obvious distillery marks the low-point and realisation that this is all it has to offer.<br/><br/>This is a cheap, popcorn action flick trading on the beloved franchise in name and nostalgia only. Worse than that, the time taken by the shallow and transparent throwbacks leaves the characters feeling very 2 dimensional and there isn't any room for a plot worth speaking of (except by the many plot contrivances). It manages to have less gravitas than the average stand-alone, high-budget, Hollywood action movie.<br/><br/>In short; it's just loud, fast and dumb, exactly what classic trek was deliberately and notably not."
"J_Leatherwood","3","60","91","11 May 2009"," Hollywood Iconoclasts Strike Again!
","I believe two days is sufficient time to calmly organize my thoughts concerning ""Star Trek 2009."" When I reluctantly went to view it over the weekend, I expected the worst because I knew producer J.J. Abrams did not really love classic Star Trek. But I actually felt physically sick during some of the worst moments of the film. If I had written this review immediately after viewing, I would have been much harsher.<br/><br/>I knew I would dislike this film intensely by the time Nero destroyed the U.S.S. Kelvin and I realized the final communications between Lt. George Kirk and his wife were supposed to be some pale kind of homage to ""Flight 93."" What a cheap gesture toward a real historical event within living memory! I almost expected to hear ""let's roll."" <br/><br/>Having said that, I did find some enjoyable aspects in the production values, as well as some of the casting decisions. Karl Urban, whom I enjoyed as Eomer in Lord of the Rings, was immediately enjoyable as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy -- though he would hardly have been contemporary with Kirk or Spock. Simon Pegg, contrary to other fans' impressions, did a creditable job as Scotty, although his introduction was rather contrived, and I do not think too much of Scotty's alien sidekick.<br/><br/>However, some of the other major characters remain somewhat uncertain, owing to the film's adolescent screenplay and weak premise. I will leave other reviewers to demolish these attributes, because for me, Star Trek was all about the main characters aboard the Enterprise. <br/><br/>Firstly, I felt Chris Pine was far too young to play James T. Kirk very convincingly, and the writers greatly exaggerated his ""rebellious"" MTV image to pander toward younger viewers. I'm surprised this Kirk does not sport some tattoos across half his body. But honestly, there are better ways to rebel than stealing a car for a joyride -- a scenario best left to the Canadian rock band, Rush, whose paean to fast cars, 1981's ""Red Barchetta,"" is also set in the near future, complete with robotic pursuers. <br/><br/>Kirk also gains promotions more rapidly than any real military officer I have ever known. It would be as though Harry Potter graduated from Hogwarts by the third novel, only to become head of his own wizarding school. This Kirk is undisciplined, sullen, and anti-intellectual, everything that William Shatner's portrayal was not. Kirk bent rules, but he seldom violated them. Kirk almost always projected optimism, one of Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's best traits. And Kirk valued intelligence and reason, even though he followed instinct as often. This Kirk is pure Generation whine, with little real character development. Promotions do not equate experience.<br/><br/>Chekov is silly and geeky, with his idiosyncratic pronunciations played up for laughter. Sulu is bland and impassive, ultimately forgettable. On the supporting cast side, I thought the Vulcans were unbelievable. Spock's youthful tormentors acted like Draco Malfoy's band of truants, instead of the coolly aloof logicians that Vulcans are supposed to be. Ben Cross did a passable Mark Lenard impersonation, whereas I could not buy that infamous ""scene-stealer"" Winona Ryder as Amanda Grayson - an important character once played by Jane Wyman (Ronald Reagan's first wife and a fine actress in her day). <br/><br/>But my real annoyance lies in the ill-advised, exotic relationship between Uhura and Spock. While both actors, Zoe Saldana and Zachary Quinto, seem capable enough in their own right, their chemistry feels forced in several awkward love scenes. The original Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) flirted mildly with Mr. Spock on occasion, to elicit emotion. This does not give license to turn Uhura into an upwardly mobile cadet who sleeps with her instructor in order to get a good assignment. <br/><br/>Gene Roddenberry would turn in his grave to see his efforts to support civil rights become an excuse for exotica. In 1967, Nichelle Nichols was encouraged to remain on ""Star Trek"" by none other than Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who saw Uhura as a positive African-American role model, particularly for girls. ""Star Trek"" also marked the first historic record for interracial kissing on television. But Captain Kirk and Lt. Uhura's kiss scene in ""Plato's Stepchildren"" happened against their wills -- a breakdown in military order. And what ever happened to Nurse Christine Chapel, Mr. Spock's real unrequited love, as portrayed by Majel Barrett -- Roddenberry's late wife? <br/><br/>Abrams and his stable of writers wanted to outdo the original source by almost cynically eradicating every trace of Gene Roddenberry's ideals. If writers Orci and Kurtzman have ever watched the original series, I believe they did so selectively. Gone are those familiar faces, that I used to see in my 1980s teenage dreams after late-night syndication. Like the traditional ""Doctor Who"" series, another part of my past is made irrelevant by iconoclastic writers and producers.<br/><br/>But wait! I have the whole original series on DVD! Popcorn anyone?"

This is the first Star Trek that I can remember that had juvenile and gratuitous sex scenes, sleazy attitudes,and the innumerable perils of Pauline type nonsense. I am not a Trekkiebut do appreciate the genius of Roddenberry. This movie had none of it. I was cringing when they had Crew members making out while about to beam to a dangerous mission. Did an 8th grader write this? In an endless and shameless attempt to put in familiar bits for nostalgia appeal, even ear bugs made a reappearance. This is not a spoiler as it had nothing to do with anything, just like the 66 corvette, and showing graphic details of a childbirth. If I want to see that I'll go to a maternity ward or to Youtube. This flick is not worth watching even if it is playing inside your eyelids. Not even worth downloading from Pirates Bay. I doubt that the writer or producer has any familiarity with the series to do what was done here. They could have watched a few episodes prior to penning this pathetic prequel. OK, I will say something positive. The Special effects are excellent, but sorry, that alone just doesn't cut it anymore. Star Trek reduced to Hollywood formula poop."

","Oh dear. I really wanted to like this movie. I am not a ""trekkie"", I don't speak Klingon or go to conventions, I am not a virgin and I don't blink profusely in day light. However I love science fiction and I have always enjoyed a bit of Star Trek. What makes Trek different from Star Wars is it is about exploration, about brave new technologies, about encountering strange weird space phenomena and somehow overcoming. Most of the time Star Trek had its own inner logic and they used scientists to help keep it consistent. Not so JJ Abrams. The writers of this nano plot know about as much science as JK Rowling. In fact the plot has more in common with Harry Potter than Star Trek. I do believe in magic. Lets list the sorcery and general dumbness.<br/><br/>*opening scene Kirk's dad had to manually fly the whole enterprise by himself as auto pilot was off-line So while manoeuvring a 20000 ton ship he manages to man all off the phaser batteries to stave off Romulan torpedoes all while chatting away on the phone to his expectant wife. *The Romulan ship is a mining ship - why is it loaded to the hilt with military grade torpedoes? * The Romulan ship is from the future. It came back some 129 years from the future through a black hole. Most scientists don't believe a black hole works that way, it simply crushes matter out of existence at its infinitely dense core. However these are magic black holes which work as time travel plot devices some times and destructive forces at others - when say you need to implode Vulcan or destroy the Romulan ship at the end. *Red matter - plot device. One drop can create a singularity (black hole). Just to be on the safe side lets have Spock carry half a ton of it in his tiny ship - which by the way is a rubbish design. *When does a supernova threaten the whole galaxy. *Why wouldn't the Romulans just flee from the star before it goes supernova in case Spock doesn't get there in time. *Why is Nero so hacked off that Spock failed in his attempt to save his home planet (while risking his own neck at the same time) *Having gone back in time why doesn't Nero warn the Romulans about the supernova. *Why do you need to drill into a planets core in order to destroy it with a black hole? *Why does drilling block all transporter and sub space communication signals? *Why not just shoot the drill out like Spock did at the end of the movie? *If there are 800 or more people on a starship why send just 2 guys in the away team to take out the mining ship? * What was Vulcan doing while it was being drilled. Sitting around with their thumbs up their butt. - not logical. *How does Kirk get promoted to Captain jumping several ranks straight out of the academy. Harry Potter becomes headmaster in his final year at school. *If you can beam trans warp across such great distances of space why do you need space ships at all. * The Romulan ship is about to be destroyed this time by the black hole - why do you need to shoot it up as well that's a bit harsh. *How does Kirk out run the hairy ice monster and when the red ice monster jumps in and kills hairy why does it decide that the comparatively small Kirk would make a better meal? * Vulcans under threat but all our Star fleet is on the other side of the galaxy in some war we've only got cadets. What all of them? YES! What if there was a surprise attack on earth - oh then we're screwed.<br/><br/>other comments about the film Kirk - not bad; Uhuru or should I say a-whore-o; Spock unconvincing; Spock Prime looks old man; Bones very good liked him; Scotty slightly better Scottish accent that Doohan; Checkov - amusing; Sulu uninspiring and pointless; Nero not very Romulan -like; special effects pretty good; sets not great - engineering rubbish; sound effects - like the jump to warp (bit star wars though); music - can't even remember the score; emotion -the star fleets been wiped out all are academy friends are dead SO WHAT! or Vulcan just got destroyed 6 billion of them are dead WHATEVER - hey Spock fancy a some kissin' and lovin' even though you are an emotionless SOB.<br/><br/>A blond bimbo of a film - pretty but vacuous."

","This is the first movie I have been to see for 7 years since LOTR two towers. (Except for a trip to the science museum to watch the space mission lab in 3d with Tom Cruise narrating.) <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to it and guess it was worth the hefty entrance price if i factor in that I will probably not go to the movies for another 7 years (unless 3d films at the cinema become the norm and they sort out the stories.)<br/><br/>Hollywood has got to start giving profit share to writers for royalties. As well as investing in some college to train writers. A ten year old could write a better script.<br/><br/>Its as if all of Hollywood has been taken over by mentally deficient monkeys with a 3 key typewriter typed by banging head against 3 buttons... EXPLOSION CHASE FIGHT. <br/><br/>...damn those monkeys...Going to take a really long time (and monkeys) to write Shakespeare with those 3 buttons.<br/><br/>The good... It all looked really good from the trailers. Special effects where in the main great (apart from the ice monsters... just why?)<br/><br/>Some individual scenes where great, kirk as a troubled youth was a good idea IMHO, which they could have spent more time on, failing at school, possibly getting tempted by drugs, maybe trying to be a pimp.<br/><br/>Spock, Uhura, Kirk (did not get enough ladies to be truly kirk,) and Bones were well cast. <br/><br/>Now the bad...<br/><br/>Mainly the storyline see below... the ugly.<br/><br/>I think Simon Pegg was miscast as Scottie, his accent was fine, but the jokes were a bit to much and his sidekick mer. <br/><br/>Ice Monsters were just tacked on and badly done.<br/><br/>Finally the ugly...<br/><br/>The story man, WTF you do to the story? Just awful plot, lame as, why not kill Vulcan when you first arrive and heres a thought how about going to ROMULUS and warning them about the NOVA... (i feel kinda dirty and special needs typing this ...truly who are writing these things?)<br/><br/>Huge gaping holes in the story. Made me feel dirty, I feel used, I want my money back and donate it to some charity writing college to buy those monkeys a better typewriter."

","Every Star Trek fan knows the ST movies aren't that good. This is because they try to be different from the series in appealing to the mainstream. But Star Trek is rock solid and it can handle some of the absolutely silly scripts we have seen in some past movies.<br/><br/>In this case we have a prequel that recasts the original cast. Questionable, but if there is a lot of story to tell then that should be acceptable. But that is exactly the problem. There was no way to tell a new story without destroying the existing storyline. So they made a new one. Makes no sense right? Well, in Star Trek you can just call it an alternative timeline and suddenly it's acceptable.<br/><br/>The movie starts and any fan of Star Trek will be shocked by the cinematic style. The camera shakes like crazy, lighting effects literally blind you. They can't get a solid shot of someone face or of two people talking. No, they give you shaking closeups with only part of their face actually on screen, quickly switching between the two persons.<br/><br/>The 4 of the 5 first scenes with Kirk are horrifying. In the first he apparently tries to commit suicide. Or he almost accidentally wins a Darwin award, can't tell. In the second he gets beaten to bloody pulp while touching breasts. Then afterward his father's friend just bluntly tells him to join Starfleet, and he does it. Makes no sense. In the third he has sex with a female Shrek-lookalike. I had to press stop again and regain my composure. The fourth is where he has a conversation with McCoy. This is stiff as wood and not redeeming, but the contrast with the previous scenes is big. They throw out some old one-liners but that doesn't work either. In the 5th he takes the Kobayashi Maru test for the third time, while eating an apple and acting like it is one big joke. Apparently this is this movie's attempt at humor.<br/><br/>Here I had to stop the movie for a third time.<br/><br/>Now you have to remember the comments the director made. He said he disliked Star Trek and thus never watched any of it himself. This explains the complete lack of the slow-paced dialogue driver story. Isn't that what Star Trek is all about? Social issues, ethical dilemmas, philosophical explorations. And what about Gene Roddenberry's vision? Wasn't Star Trek to inspire kids not only to be inspired to study very hard on math and science but also to instill hope in them that in the future we would be able to improve our societies and values?<br/><br/>Star Trek was able to do what it did by not requiring the viewer to suspend disbelief in many cases, so you were able to do it when it mattered. In this movie even basic dialogue seems awkward. Why the hell does Kirk join Starfleet? Just one stupid fight? Or just because this Pike guy wants him to? This movie has no story to tell. They decided they wanted to make another ST movie first. Then they had to make up a story: ""Big evil ship piloted by the big bad guy is out to destroy the universe, merely out of spite."" They decided upon that. Didn't we already have exactly that with Star Trek Nemesis? And isn't that already the most basic SF storyline you can come up with? Khan?<br/><br/>One of the most glaring problems of this movie is the decisions the characters make. You expect all decisions to be reasonable or at least within a certain range making it believable enough. Sometimes the writer may want to move the story in a certain direction and it is difficult or apparently impossible to make the characters sway in that direction. This is where writing skill comes in. But they decided that at any point the story can do whatever they want no matter what. This is why Starfleet can load up their flagship with fresh cadets. This is why McCoy desperately tries to get Kirk on the ship as if he already knows why Kirk has to be on the ship. This is why for example Kirk can take over as captain of the ship while Starfleet judges him to be completely incompetent.<br/><br/>The third biggest problem about this movie is that every dialogue is unnatural. There has been this trend in Hollywood where a natural dialogue is going to be awkward because the viewer expects an artificial style dialogue. People speak a certain way in Hollywood movies which is different from a natural dialogue. This makes them look fake even more.<br/><br/>We all know Hollywood can't tell a story. But what is best about Star Trek is worst about this movie. This movie is to Star Wars as Star Wars is to Star Trek. If you think Star Wars was too cerebral then maybe this movie is for you. This movie is literally intentionally made for people that hate Star Trek. This movie is literally made so that people that like Star Trek hate this movie.<br/><br/>So the big question to me is: why? Why make this movie. Why make a movie that is nothing like Star Trek in the Star Trek universe and even with a recast of the original characters? Money of course. And I don't really blame them. But the fact that they succeed amazes me. How the hell does this movie have such a high score on IMDb. And also on Rotten Tomatoes. WTF is wrong with you people? Look at the insane box office revenue. This movie literally is Star Trek from a parallel universe; a universe where humanity isn't smart enough to get into the industrial revolution even if it hit them in the face. I blame the people liking this movie. They create demand for this kind of trash. Shame on you!"
"Poseidon-3","Null","38","56","20 May 2009"," Frenetic, brainless bastardization of the original concept.
","It happens on daytime television: A new storyline is developed which renders everything that came before it impossible and inconsistent. It happens in comic books: Entire histories and established conceits of a character or situation are redone without regard for the previous effort. Here it happens in a movie. A revisionist, souped-up, tweaked version of the famous television series comes along that jettisons about 80% of what made the original meaningful, resonant and special. Not only does it reconfigure or ignore the ""established"" continuity of the characters' prior universe, but it's also unapologetic about it. Who cares what anyone else thought when they watched ""Star Trek"" during its original run or in syndication? This is the way it's going to be for the A.D.D., Xbox, Jonas Brothers, youtube, Hannah Montana, iPod, CGI set and anyone who doesn't like it can be damned. Since the makers of this and other products, which undercut any personal investment a viewer may have made in the previous work, have no regard for that audience, the only recourse that audience has is to resist supporting the new work. However, that hardly matters when something comes along that, despite its emptiness, idiocy and even ignorance, appeals so much to the target audience that it can't help but be a huge success. All that's left to do is either chuck one's emotional connection to the original concept and get on board or sit at home with the 4 decade old series on DVD. Though not every fan of the original series will be this polarized, it's a decision that many folks will have to make. The good news is that Pine is an appealing, dynamic and enthusiastic Kirk (though not much like William Shatner, for better or for worse), Quinto is close to perfection as Spock in both looks and manner and the chemistry between the core cast members is adequate enough to provide a decent sense of camaraderie in the inevitable follow-up, especially if, on the off chance, the producers decide to actually follow the intended path and put the team into the scenario of seeking out ""new life and new civilizations"" together instead of rehashing and retreading everything that was already ""established."" Cross and Ryder also prove to be effective choices as Quinto's parents. Also, Bana's ship is decidedly imposing and threatening looking. The bad news is that virtually any semblance of the vision, social commentary, optimism, discovery, sense of unity or even a sense of adventure, really, is absent from this incarnation. In its place are lightning fast camera-work and editing, animated effects, over-the-top ""stunts"" and lots of explosions and death. The people are props and/or caricatures and are, in fact, incidental to the action ""showpieces."" With luck, the next installment will capitalize on the premise of the Enterprise's mission and allow the ensemble to gel into a unit that sticks together as they explore the farthest reaches of the galaxy. This messy, inane, disrespectful prologue doesn't inspire much faith, however. Oh, and check out the female Vulcan council-member's beaming expression of pride and joy when Spock is admitted to their academy! Did anyone associated with this film ever see even one episode of the series?"

","Okay... so... yet ANOTHER time travel story in Star Trek. So... Nero is the mad magician captain of a HUGE mining ship which has ungodly numbers of weapons and missiles used in the destruction of enemy... mines? <br/><br/>So... Nero, upon learning of the destruction of his planet, and the implementation of the ""red matter"" by Spock, AND he returns 25 years in time AND discovers that it IS twenty five years earlier, DOES NOTHING to warn the still existent Romulus and his wife and children of the Supernova that WILL occur in twenty five years? No. no. Better for the fearsome captain of the mining ship with a 30 mile spiked chain which holds a disk that does nothing to mine other than burn a hole in the ground, to only swear to kill Spock, and destroy Vulcan with the red matter that he could have been using to, 25 years in advance, destroy the supernova that is going to kill his wife, his people, and his planet at the time he is caught up in the black hole worm hole.<br/><br/>So... Spock is caught and marooned by Nero on a moon or planet that is within sight of Vulcan with all the weather gear to survive a winter, AND within walking distance of a Star Fleet outpost that he NEVER chooses to walk to UNTIL Kirk arrives on the same planet AND he makes no effort to warn Star Fleet or ANYONE of the cataclysmic supernova that will, IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS, RE-DESTROY the planet of Romulus AND makes no effort to tell himself that his RED MATTER (which he could go back an tell himself HOw to make correctly, and IN TIME) will be deliver too late, and that Romulus will be destroyed. and..<br/><br/>And, of course, for the ladies, we need for Spock's internal drama to be sexy. He needs to be controlled on the outside, yet (hand to forehead) conflicted from within. Sigh...<br/><br/>And, yet again, another warp core has to be jettisoned to save the world. You know, it seems to me that Star Fleet would figure out that Warp Cores are the most versatile and useful item in history and just design ships that carried SPARE warp cores around to use for defense, attack, or propulsion. <br/><br/>I'll type more description of the idiocy in this move later. I'm too cheesed right now."

","I love Star Trek. And I hated this remake.<br/><br/>I fault the script by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. These guys do TV. They do action, not character development. Not original ideas.<br/><br/>It's certainly not the cast's fault. Casting was superb. It's the only reason I can find as to why this film is rated 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Not only was Zachary Quinto's Spock a standout, but every time Karl Urban did Bones, I was engaged at warp speed.<br/><br/>Though Chris Pine's Kirk was disappointing. Why make him speak like a big city bad-boy? He's supposedly a farm kid longing for a dad. And where were the Shatnerisms? I only caught one moment where Pine was allowed to unleash his brilliant reinvention of original Kirk, and it left me swooning — just as Kirk is bloody well supposed to.<br/><br/>But I don't blame Pine, I blame the lousy dialogue. And worse, the fact Kirk's character undergoes no transformation. He never faces any consequences for his behavior, other than a few punches. This gets dull fast, and by the time he's being promoted to highest command of the ship (thanks to his one good idea amidst all the mistakes), this lack of evolution has become tedious.<br/><br/>Spock's journey is slightly more interesting, as he turns moody and unprincipled. Though I don't believe this overblown everybody's-gotta-die version of their history laid the foundation for the adult he would later become.<br/><br/>What if this tragedy had actually caused him to make a choice? To veer towards human, and to use his extensive knowledge (wonderfully set up by the learning pods on Vulcan) to become a great Captain? Now that would have shaken things up. Kirk could have become his First Officer, and the writers of all the sequels could have leveraged that role reversal to no end, truly bringing us something new.<br/><br/>But, back to what existed in this (alternate) reality.<br/><br/>Though not very well executed, the idea of starting Kirk and Spock as enemies was brilliant. But how disappointing that the story doesn't make them work for their friendship. Instead, we have a Spock of Christmas Future who can just mind-meld Kirk into brotherly love.<br/><br/>And what if Kirk had chosen not to follow his potential future? What if he refused to take on that inevitable destiny? That would have brought such tension to the rest of the film, because our desire to have him become Captain, and to have them become beloved companions again, would be in real jeopardy.<br/><br/>It also would play truer to Kirk's character at that age. He's the rebel who does the opposite of what he's told. He'd never follow a prescribed future.<br/><br/>That's where the alternate reality plot line could have done more than save the day, as it did here, but make this film shine.<br/><br/>This script is a sorry mash up of other people's good ideas. Right down to Khan II: the wrath of Nero (a waste of Eric Bana's talents), and the red matter/molecular death star, and the mind control slug/bug, now available in easy-to-insert esophagus size.<br/><br/>Well, at least the overacting third crew member sent with Kirk and Sulu to deactivate the interstellar drill (drill? for Christ's sake boys, don't space cruisers have powerful lasers for that sort of thing?) is wearing a red space suit.<br/><br/>And what about all those silly slapstick moments busting up the dramatic tension? Like Scotty getting beamed into the water system? The annoyingly Ewok-like lizard creature in the ice planet's space lab? Spock's homicidal shipwrecking of Kirk, instead of putting him in the brig? And in what universe does Starfleet allow bridge crew a little pre-mission make out time out on the transporter pad? I don't even want to talk about the Spock-Uhura affair.<br/><br/>Though in my alternate reality, where Spock chooses his human side, I'd buy it. But it would have to be far more elegant than this.<br/><br/>What we have here nonsense like that deus ex machina moment where Spock Sr. happens to be on the ice planet (Hoth?) at the exact time and place to rescue Kirk Jr. from certain demise by snow-gecko.<br/><br/>And a sequence that beams Kirk and Scotty onto a warp-speed Enterprise. (Isn't science fiction supposed to include science-based innovations, instead of plot-driven drivel?) How about the climax of Kirk insulting Spock's beloved — and recently killed — mother to win command? It's ripped straight from an old episode, but in a way that makes Kirk a repulsive person.<br/><br/>Whatever happened to making characters work to get what they want? To watching them struggle and grow by finding innovative solutions to problems? To using action sequences to discover their humanity and nobility? Oh wait, for a second I think I slipped into a parallel universe where J. Michael Straczynski or Neil Gaiman had written this.<br/><br/>Now that's a Trekiverse I want to go to."
"tallmantim","4","40","60","12 May 2009"," How did the writing for this get to the screen?
","To start with, I should say that I am not a ""Trekkie"" - I am aware of the characters broadly and have even watched some episodes and previous movies, but am not an aficionado nor a big fan. I had seen the shorts for this movie and following a young Kirk looked excellent and it appeared to be a rollicking action film.<br/><br/>So, to start with the good:<br/><br/>* Casting was superb, as was the acting. I felt the actors embodied the feeling of the series and carried out their part in the script flawlessly. * Action scenes were well choreographed and were enjoyable. * Production quality, as you would expect, was high - the movie certainly looked very slick, and I particularly like the start with Iowan farm showing massive star-scrapers in the background. * First scenes were good, with Kirk entering the academy.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>* Suspension of disbelief is severely taxed - I can take ""red matter"" and other plot elements at face value, but had a real problem taking a lot of other things as such. * We are dealing with an alternate history, but the idea that 25 years of altered history has lead all of the main characters in Star Trek to exactly the same points beggars belief! * There are 430 crew on board the ship, however recent military graduates end up running the entire ship? There is one old guy in the crew and the rest all come from military college - and they didn't even graduate? * Crew was assigned to a new space ship with no time or effort being put towards shaking down the ship nor the crew? * The command bridge of the vessel seems to be a social lounge, where anyone - including civilians can saunter onto * A mining vehicle - even one from 129 years into the future - has sufficient technology that it can destroy an entire fleet of warships - even whilst tethered to a planet and unable to move * The protagonist (Nero) was barely even a one dimensional character - he was simply angry * A mining ship has a huge internal volume for some reason that is fully pressurised and heated * A spaceship that becomes a singularity suddenly has enough mass to drag in the Enterprise (this one is a physics geek quibble admittedly...)<br/><br/>The ugly:<br/><br/>* The writing was just lazy - kirk is ejected out onto an ice planet by Spock - and this is supposed to be in some way logical? ARRGGGHHH!!! * My guess is the writers were hamstrung - they were given a brief where they had to tailor the story in a two hour time-frame so that we could have the old crew in charge of the starship Enterprise to facilitate the corporate requirements of big business movie making - hence the reason why so many of the plot elements make no sense.<br/><br/>At the end of this movie, I was looking forward to the end - just to make it stop! I found it quite frustrating dealing with plot holes you could drive a Mac truck through!<br/><br/>No doubt, now that they have the crew together, the next story they will release can be more self consistent.<br/><br/>Perhaps you just need to be a Trekkie to enjoy this one?"

","I have never been so disappointed by a movie than i was by this bubble gum attempt at a prequel. I could have made a better movie on my camera phone. Whoever picked JJ Abrams to direct should be shot. In some interviews, he admits that he's not a star trek fan. Boy, oh boy, does it show. He's 'lost' when it comes to directing; he didn't get any good performances from his actors; It looks like all shots were done on the first take; he rushed through production; and a lot of short sequences in the movie went nowhere and should have been cut. I'm sure he was the one who brought the idiots Kurtzman and Orci to write this poor excuse of a star trek film. Their plot line had so many holes, it was like swiss cheese. I mean they took a massive icon that is star trek and were given the task of making a prequel, and this is the best they could come up with??? <br/><br/>Young Kirk drives a corvette off a cliff?? Uhura kiss Spock?? Scotty stuck in a water pipe?? What the heck is 'red matter'?? Launch Kirk off the Enterprise in a pod?? Kirk loses every fight??

This film contains a plot where a Romulan comes back in time, to the day of Kirk's birth and changes history, so now Abrahms can do what he likes and this film gives him carte blanche to do so.<br/><br/>So throughout the film we are treated to events which are completely at odds with a whole heap of history built up in the films, so that by the end you are left feeling that all of the things you loved about Star Trek have been discarded as not important.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film in parts, the plot was a bit odd, but the acting and special effects were good.

","Wonderful special effects, brilliant camera work, excellent special effects, believable actors to take the place of Shatner, Spock, McCoy, Chekov, Sulu, Scott, and Uhura. Must see and enjoy but leave your brains at home. The story doesn't make sense. Let's just assume that I am a Romulan and knew the boo boo Dr. Spock is going to make. The solution is simple, get the red matter and kill the super nova 129 years before it happens. The retribution doesn't make sense. It won't stop the Romulan genocide. The logic is simple. I am a Romulan, ghastly found error Dr. Spock made and if I killed the planet Vulcan, and Spock (or Ambassador Spock) have not died, he's going to go about making the same boo boo 129 years from now killing the entire civilization of the Romulans. A reasonable alternative is just to kill Mr. Spock, without the need to kill the entire planet of Vulcan. So what happens if entire planet of Vulcan died and I guess the Romulans wouldn't be saved either without an advanced warning. Knowing the entire mess of the story and we wish to mend the stupid things Romulans made by killing off Kirk's father and the planet Vulcan an easy solution is for Spock to show how NCC 1701 can travel to time going back the time where his father was killed, just before so we get a Doppleganger, a twin NCC 1701, but the second ship, knowing Romulans will disable the code to protect the shields to kill the Romulan's waiting to kill the original star fleet. Thus once the Romulans are destroyed, the red matter confiscated from the ship is then used to destroy super Nova that suppose to explode 129 years later and the NCC 1701 thereby goes into the same period, without any event. The End. An uneasy Star Trek saga, a bad premise, an illogical story is not likely is going to sit well with IMDb top 250 movies for long. Since when will these writers get their head straight? 10 for movie, 1 for story line, 1 for premise and 1 for logic. My guess 3/10. Still a must see movie for Trekkies like me despite of a terrible movie's story and a nightmare for me. It's as unsettling as Captain Kirk's death when the bridge fell over him after leaving Nexus. This will be up there with bad story lines as same as other previous star trek. In any event, the Wrath of Khan is underrated and this, overrated, except for the special effects and the notion of time travel, but lacks the obvious logic. A much simpler story Ha Ha Ha is for Mr. Spock to go to planet Romulan and murder baby Nero, then kill off the exploding supernova. Oh hot pancake, the story isn't dramatic."

","Not only did JJ Abrams not know the first thing about Star Trek, what he did go and learn he decided to intentionally destroy. I could spend WEEKS listing all the idiotic things in this movie... First of all, before ANYTHING else, no matter WHAT you think, there was no reason to completely destroy the Star Trek universe by blowing up Vulcan. It was Abrams taking a dump on the ENTIRE history of Trek. As a story point is was stupid, too. And WAY too easy. This fact alone ensures that I will never watch another Abrams product - no matter what it is (let alone his next Trek movie).<br/><br/>You know, I don't even want to waste any more time listing the other many idiotic elements of this un-inspired lame movie (the enemy was flat, the story had been done over and over, etc.). Uhura and Spock!?! Right, another stupid move. They go on and on. I will say that I liked the shuttlecraft (except the stupid idea of beaming across light years from one).<br/><br/>If you hate Star Trek, go see this movie. It's juvenile and standard Abrams, so you may like it. If you have any respect for Star Trek then this is a slap in the face to you."
"billing-20","2","44","67","15 June 2009"," And when I say ""alternate"" future I mean ""unintelligent and pointless""
","This is a really disappointing movie. This reboot of the Star Trek universe is way off the mark. The original series certainly shows its 1960's roots, but the characters, and almost all of the stories, were intelligently written and imaginatively and consistently developed.<br/><br/>The relationship between Kirk and Spock was built around each providing a counterpoint for the other's strengths, with Spock, of course, balancing Kirk's passion with a healthy dose of reason. Between them, they formed a symbiotic medium, reflecting the human condition that leadership and advancement comes from a balance of both reason and passion.<br/><br/>The original Kirk was passionate and decisive, but was not reckless. Nor was he consumed by his own crude, punk emotions. He was a leader who understood that his responsibilities extended to his ship, his crew, Star Fleet, and the rules and aims of the larger society. He let this guide his decisions. Even by himself, there was responsibility, rationality and reason within him. Spock represented, and added to, the pure rational component of any argument. Put together, the two characters showed us that goals and problems are best addressed by moving the human condition towards a stronger sense of responsibility, rationality and reason. It was a vision for the future.<br/><br/>Against that, in this new movie, both characters have moved decidedly away from the rational and towards the emotional. Kirk is now just some one-dimensional, self-obsessed, reckless angry rebel who treats every situation as an opportunity to start a bar fight (literally and/or figuratively). One expects future dialog to be along the lines of ""Spock, did you see the way that ambassador glanced at me during negotiations? He needs a lesson in respect. Fire all photon torpedoes!!"" Who in their right mind would want such a character as a starship captain?<br/><br/>And the new Spock has had the strengths of his rational side completely neutered. This new movie makes it obvious that his rational Vulcan side is ineffective, unimportant and weak, and that the emotional human side is where all the important cool parts are. The arc of the story in this movie seems to be constantly telling him: ""Dude...stop thinking so much! What you need is to do is get yourself a girlfriend, get laid, have a few shots of Jack Daniels, and go punch a few people."" <br/><br/>Similar dumbing-down occurs with the destruction of Vulcan. Six billion lives lost from a culture that was as advanced, peaceful and intelligent as the Vulcans (remember...it was the Vulcan's who first reached out to humanity to make First Contact) is an tragic, important event. The original series would have made THAT the point of the event, as it should be. But in this movie, the only really important thing was that Spock's mother was killed. Well! Now it's personal I guess! No wonder he's mad! Why is it that movies such as this can't talk in the important abstract? Why is there always the need to introduce the personal vendetta? Why can we not have an important cause that is worth struggling for in its own right? <br/><br/>In the aggregate, whereas the point of the original relationship between Spock and Kirk was that the addition of stronger reasoning adds to our human capacity, the point of this movie seems to be the opposite: that what humans need to do is reason less, think less, make everything personal, give authority and responsibility the finger, break as many rules as possible, and get into as many bar fights as we possibly can. I was hoping that we'd left that attitude behind us with the passing of the Bush years...but I guess not.<br/><br/>As a side rant on that...the American psyche is frustrating in its contradictions. We live in gated communities to keep us away from exactly the bar-fighting trash represented by Kirk in this movie. We want harsh, lock-em-away laws if such characters challenge our peace of mind. But in the movies, we celebrate those same characters fighting authority, breaking all the rules, thumbing their noses at exactly us and those we appoint, punching anyone who asks them to be reasonable, killing anyone who tries to stop them, and winning only by fighting, not by thinking or working together. The same effect shows up in shows like Prison Break. How does a society both impose capital punishment AND cheer for the (supposedly) wrongly convicted to fight against the police that are trying to enforce the very laws that us as a society put in place? If we recognize that people are sometimes wrongly convicted...why are we killing them? <br/><br/>The other sad direction in this movie was the removal of Vulcans and Romulans as alternate societies. Again, we seem to be taking the attitude that only ""us"" humans matter. The ""others"" are uninteresting, unimportant, and potentially get in the way. Whereas the original series celebrated the idea of different societies, and recognized that any society (even all of humanity itself) will benefit by coming together into a larger common society with others of sympathetic goals, this movie promotes the idea that we would be better off if everyone was more like us, or better yet, if everyone else BUT us would disappear. In this movie the ""us"" is humanity compared to the ""them"" of other planets. In our world, the ""us"" is our culture or country compared to the ""them"" of other cultures or countries. Again...I was hoping that such a provincial attitude would pass with the Bush years...but again sadly, I must be mistaken.<br/><br/>The original series was a vision for the future...a larger, more interesting future. The new movie is a vision for the past...a provincial, isolationist, fearful past. In the end, the world, and the galaxy, are both poorer places because of this movie when compared to the vision and intellect of the original series."

","It's mind-boggling to think that fans of the teleshow(s) would actually wax enthusiastic about this one: STAR TREK ZERO (the all-too appropriate working title) lacks every single essential ingredient to make a movie memorable. The performances are all of high school talent show-calibre and only make all the more glaring the faults of the disjointed storyline(s). (Bana must be singled out, here: I honestly don't recall the last time I saw so uncharismatic a villain in a major motion picture. Unless, of course, we count the two FANTASTIC FOUR films.) The camera swoops and spins and dives and goes in one ear and out the other, up the nostril and through the nasal passage to grandmother's house we go- all in the vain hope that viewers won't notice that there's nothing really going on (like in a video game). Not since ALIENS (the second one, by the guy that did GIGANTIC) have I laughed so hard at so many ""dramatic moments."" Watch this one on the internet and save yourself a couple of bucks. You can thank me later."
"wizardly","5","67","106","9 May 2009"," Plot hole.
","Plot hole! Big, giant, gaping, universe-destroying plot hole! For every ounce of praise that can be heaped on this movie, there is one simple yet massive retort: plot hole.<br/><br/>For starters the tag line, ""the future begins"" is misleading. This is NOT a prequel. This is an alternate reality. Unlike the remake of ""Batman"" this is not a stand-alone remake of everything. There is the Spock we know from the original franchise come back into this alternative past. This leads to a plot hole.<br/><br/>To be fair this is a good action movie in as much as ""Troy"" was a good action movie, and like it the mythology is butchered. There is very good emotional conflict in the movie and even a sense of subtlety behind it. The acting is even very well done. The opening sequence leaves no doubt of that. Urban is a fantastic McCoy. The skill of the actors is by far the best thing in the movie.<br/><br/>The shooting was abysmal. The usage of shaken-scenes is horrendous. If not for the explanatory dialog, i.e. ""they're launching torpedoes,"" I would have had no idea what was happening. Instead of the smooth, hyper-visible action of the ""Matrix"" series we're left with our heads against a jackhammer.<br/><br/>Finally, the ruination of this movie if not the entire series to inevitably follow is the writing. The comedic timing was excellent. The stow-away sequence is a gem. However, the writers seemed to have a problem deciding to restart from scratch or link this to the original franchise. Their compromise is sloppy. Character development is modest at best and unfortunately any novice to this universe is going to require exposure to the universe that was also abandoned.<br/><br/>There is also a fair amount of triteness to all of this action. The scene of being chased by an animal in the snow, only to have the animal eaten by a bigger animal (and in the end it's afraid of fire) wreaks of the ""Phantom Menace"" debacle.<br/><br/>The biggest fault of the writing are the plot holes:<br/><br/>*Time travel. The most trite waste of time in science fiction. Overused, under explained, and sloppily done almost every time - this is no exception. Bad guy comes back in time to change the past. However, by changing the past he precludes his own actions and that of his futuristic counterpart. On the other hand, maybe he doesn't change the past but instead goes to an alternate universe. That's fine, but then what's the point of blowing up someone else's Earth and Vulcan if it won't have any effect on your own future and won't have any effect on them? Moreover, why wouldn't someone in the future come back to stop you from messing with their future? <br/><br/>*Kirk never finishes the academy. He's not even commissioned. Moreover, he's a stow-away. When push comes to shove, surpassing all sense of rank, he's made second in command. Somewhere on that ship are a lot of angry lieutenants. If anyone in the military actually makes major before they're done with boot camp let me know and I'll believe this. <br/><br/>*Why would someone be carrying so much 'red matter' to destroy the universe many times over if they're going to just make one black hole? Why didn't he blow up his ship to stop all of this in the first place? *How do you show up late to a supernova?<br/><br/>*Why would you make someone a captain fresh out of training?<br/><br/>*Why didn't someone just shoot the drill? Why do you need to lower a drill? You can't drill into San Francisco with a drill you lower into the atmosphere because you're not in geosynchronous orbit and the drag on the drill and the cable by the atmosphere would shake it around a lot.<br/><br/>*Sulu fences like Jet Li. Who carries a sword into space anyway?<br/><br/>*If you can transport people and things traveling great distances at warp speed, why even go to planets anymore?<br/><br/>What is with all the pipes in the engineering spaces? What is with the water pipe big enough for a person and the turbine at the end?<br/><br/>*If in the span of a few seconds Spock's ship travels in time 25 years after the mining ship, why then in the several seconds that it took the mining ship to emerge did it appear all at once rather than over the course of several years?<br/><br/>*How do you create a black hole in a planet that can be seen from another planet, but at the same time the second planet is not also destroyed? Black holes aren't holes that can be traversed.<br/><br/>The casualties are too numerous, not to mention my sense of equilibrium and my wallet. I think this movie could have been done much better and without violating anything involved in the series that preceded it. More effort should have been taken to have the science make sense and to connect this to the original franchise and create a true prequel. Either that or this should have been a stand-alone without the reliance on the original franchise for character and plot development.<br/><br/>I fail to see the point in caring about an alternate version of the franchise. These aren't the characters that have existed for the last several decades - this is an alternate reality. This isn't a reboot. This is a parallel. The origins of Batman, Superman, Wolverine, Dracula, and on and on have been redone time and again. In each, they are the same person in their own encompassed universe. You care about only one at a time and compare the universes. This movie leads you to believe it is the origins of everything that supersedes it; however, it destroys it instead."

"soundtechpro","8","90","147","8 May 2009"," A Huge Let Down for Trekkies - If only...........
","First let me say that I have been a lifelong Star Trek fan.That being said I was very disappointed with this movie. I had high expectations with JJ Abrams on board. I fully expected this movie to be true to the Star Trek universe instead of the Action/Sci-Fi movie concept. Star Trek has always been first and foremost a show about relationships and moral/social issues. Action is great but only when it is secondary to the characters we love so much and the story line. I know that I was expecting the movie to not only show how the main character met but how those relationships developed. Basically what we got was a quick introduction to the characters and an action movie with a confusing story line that left many unresolved issues that was not in line with the original series events. While Star Trek has always made use of the time travel concept it appeared it was only used in this movie as a way to work Leonard Nimoy into the movie. The ""Nero"" story was so weak and the movie was not really at all about the development of the characters we have all loved for so many years. As for the ""Nero"" story, just killing Nero would not have reversed the time line. We know in the original series that Amanda Grayson (Spock's mom) is alive and that the planet Vulcan was never destroyed completely with only a few Vulcans left to colonize another planet. In the original series, the reference was that Vulcans were a waring people who almost destroyed themselves before they gained control of their emotions. I am still trying to figure this confusing story line out. I suppose that some will say the movie was a success because it was action packed, exciting and appealed to a non-trekkie younger audience. However, I personally feel it was a failure. I admit that the casting was good. However, good casting cannot overcome a bad storyline. My advice, If you are a true Trekkie, wait for the DVD. If you just like action/sci-fi then you will love it. But there was nothing special about this movie. It left me very hollow and thinking about ""what might have been"" had they made a movie with the characters being central instead of the action/fight scenes. I believe this movie was written and marketed to be new, hip and appeal to teenagers. It is definitely not faithful to the Star Trek genre."
"bentamachan","3","20","28","2 January 2010"," Oh no... if only i could have been given a Vulcan nerve pinch
","I will start of by saying this is my first review. Shame it takes a bad movie to get me fired up enough to send one.<br/><br/>First the good news. It's a fast paced (Star Wars-esquire) movie... lots of special effects, and lots of action. If you knew nothing of Star Trek, then you might enjoy this quite a bit... but... i'm not convinced that it stands up even as a non-Trek movie. There's too many holes. Too many strange, lazy writing. I know it's not easy writing a good story... but please... at least try.<br/><br/>My Top 10 Problems with this movie:<br/><br/>(1) Kirk is jerk... OK... that was in the original as well, so i guess that's not so much a problem as a reasonable rendition. But please... if this was the military - people like Kirk would have never made it through the academy. He flaunts authority, deceives people (he didn't wonder what would happen to the poor girl he deceived into cheating for him), and he endangers people's lives because HE thinks he's right.<br/><br/>(2) The whole Nero thing is a complete mystery. As pointed out previously - wouldn't your first reaction be to try and save your planet... rather than going on a rampage to kill as many people as possible? What was his motivation? And what was he doing when Romulus was destroyed? Also - why can Spock and the Romulan ship survive going through the Black Hole... but nothing else can? <br/><br/>(3) Then there's the 25 year gap... of course there needed to be a plot device to link the baddie from Kirk's father's demise and Kirk himself. But really - they were in a Klingon prison for 25 years?... and then they very kindly let them have their ship back (in original condition)? I mean... how did the Klingons get them in the first place?... what with their ship being so advanced and all.... <br/><br/>(4) Kirk being abandoned on a ice cube of a planet... hold on... isn't that essentially a death sentence? Nice one Spock... obviously messing with the time stream lets you blow off some steam. Be interesting to see how he'd explain that one back home... <br/><br/>(5)Spock is Nero's arch-nemesis... he's been waiting for 25 years (and he knew when he'd pop out how?)... and what does he do. Gives him front row seats. On a different planet (that seemed to be in a different system, but i'll stand corrected on that)... where he has front row seats. Hmmm... interesting, close enough to see all the gory detail, but far enough away that the planet isn't pulled into the created black hole too. Sweet. And it's good of Nero to just let him stay there... to allow him to move on to another unexplained revenge sequence. Anyhow that's pretty FANTASTIC revenge planning after waiting 25 years <br/><br/>(6) All it takes for Kirk to be made Captain is to make Spock ""emotional""... oh - that and to have been made first officer after illegally boarding the Enterprise, and then being thrown off for mutiny. The one thing about this... what would be the punishment for taunting a Star Fleet captain after watching both his mother... and his WHOLE PLANET being sucked into a black hole.... yeah... he really should get his emotions in order. Not like Kirk, who would never act out of instinct or emotion?<br/><br/>(7) It's great when you use the destruction of a planet (Vulcan) as a plot device. That's OK.. they can always go back in time next installment and fix things up like they never happened.... alternatively... if you believe the alternative histories thing... then all Nero would need to have done is warned his people about the disaster, and none of it would have happened (in this time stream). Coz if you think it matters that it's a different reality, then his vengeance on the new Vulcan is pretty petty.<br/><br/>(8) If you hand't worked it out... time travel sucks as a plot device.<br/><br/>(9) How the hell much ""RED MATTER"" does one person need? Couldn't they transport this stuff somewhere (perhaps not... that's why they needed the mining vessel...)? Couldn't they have at least tried to beam more people up whilst they were waiting for Spock to re-unite with his parents? Speaking of transporter stuff... so Scotty invents the warp- transporter... by Spock telling him how to do it. Interesting. And why did they only send over two people to the Romulan ship?<br/><br/>(10) How did the mining vessel get so NASTY anyhow? IT's A MINING SHIP... not a war-fighting craft. I guess those Romulan's are a bit uppity.<br/><br/>All up... it was a barely passable movie (much preferred Terminator Salvation as a new SciFi installment!) - but as a Star Trek it really blowed... and for story reasons that could have been readily rectified if they hadn't just ""made stuff up"". I'm not a Star Trek nutter... but i just like good story-telling.<br/><br/>However - given the number of high scores here, i guess that people that like stories that make sense (at least internally consistent) are not that common these days."

","(To start off with, this is a repost, and I suppose that there are spoilers enclosed (although why to mention that now after the movie has been out for many months is beyond me). And, yes, if I do mention what others have said, it is only to make my points.) I am afraid that the misgivings about this film that I had when I first heard and saw various pictures from the production were justified.<br/><br/>How to start? When the film first started, I was a little perplexed, and wondered what I was watching. A starship destroyed. Been done before. So what. When it came to the introduction of the main characters, I thought that those were well done and to the point. However, I thought that the plot of the story was dull and uninteresting.<br/><br/>Then there was the interiors of the Enterprise itself. That was the engine room? I half expected Gene Hackman guiding the passengers from the Posiedon Adventure and telling them ""Just one more deck up."" I have to agree with others on this board when they said that it looked more like a oil refinery, submarine, or (as mentioned through the reference of the Posiedon Adventure (made by myself) the bowels of a cruise ship like the QE2. The bridge was only the topping on the cake for this dislike.<br/><br/>Now that I think of it, some of the behavior of the crew itself was not to what I had known of them. Chekov leaving the bridge to operate the transporter? Since when did he know how to operate that? In the Star Trek I know, he would have been reprimanded for leaving his post. Then there was the scenes between Uhura and Spock. A romance? Ridiculous, especially since Spock had always thrived to never have emotions displayed. Then, if all of that was not bad enough, they said it was an ""alternate universe"".<br/><br/>You know, for years I watched Star Trek because of the message that it had to convey: a better life for humanity. Instead, what do we have? A film that was only tooled for the younger set by using overrated effects. The message is gone. If you like this film, then more power to you, but you will be left out because of Abrams not employing Roddenberry's message."

"Pelrad","4","24","35","21 May 2009"," Pubescent Trek
","I've seen all the Star Trek movies, all episodes of the original series, and all episodes of The Next Generation. When I first heard about the premise for the new film, I had mixed feelings. On the one hand I thought it would be interesting to see how the original gang came together and some background of the original characters. But on the other hand I wondered why they were reverting to the past instead of moving forward with the saga.<br/><br/>The opening scene was visually stunning. And, visually, the film was a treat, comprising a heck of a lot of detail. But when the pubescent characters were gradually introduced running around recklessly with their teenage hormones, I began rolling my eyes. If the casting director had chosen good actors, things would have been much different. Simply put: the actor who played the young James Kirk can't act. Many of the actors were television stars. And bringing second-rate TV actors onto the big screen is never wise.<br/><br/>The other thing that I resented was the young Spock character. The actor did a fairly good job, but what was so admirable about the original Spock and arguably the draw of the original series was his lack of emotion. And using this against Kirk and especially Bones' emotional reactions was appealing. Any show works best when the characters are diverse rather than redundant. When you employ cultural imperialism by making Spock give in to the inferred superiority of Earth or human culture, you not only make things less interesting but give people a bad taste in their mouths. The film seemed to be saying, ""Let's test Spock's logic by destroying inferior planet Vulcan and his mom and have him finally give into our superior human ways by showing lots of emotion."" What adolescent stupidity! Finally, time travel has been done too much in Star Trek films. The story could have been just as good if the Enterprise had encountered a formidable ship from an alien race of the present. They did it obviously just so that they could have the older Spock in the movie. I thought it would have been better had they just opened with the old Spock as a narrator, reminiscing about old times and then saying, ""I bet you are wondering how it all came together and how the original crew came together on our first mission."" And then the movie goes into the story.<br/><br/>To sum it up, visually the movie was fun at times. But with annoying teenage recklessness, bad acting, Spock's outbursts, cultural imperialism, and tired time travel, this was a bad Star Trek movie."
"taliesin1900","4","24","35","18 May 2009"," More Hormones and Hype
","There are plenty of teen ""coming of age"" movies out there. They all follow a similar formula: youth is picked on by bully, youth rebels against the authority that does not recognize how great youth is and has allowed the bullying, for the older teens there is sex, parents or other role models die, some bully is defeated and the final recognition of the youth's greatness. From ""Stand By Me"" to ""Harry Potter"" to any of about a million other stories. You can't go wrong with this formula because there are many teenagers, and those that remember being teenagers (a few who will never grow out of being teenagers), and we all love sex, battle scenes, and triumphant heroes. This new ""Star Trek"" movie has that in buckets. However, if you have come to see anything that has more than the paper thin appearance of ""Star Trek"" characters, stories, or the like, I can't see how you would enjoy the movie. I grew up in Houston and our group of kids loved to watch the original ""Star Trek"" series reruns in the 1970s and, although I haven't stayed with the subsequent series like ""The Next Generation"", I was intrigued with seeing a retake on the original. While a pleasant summer action film, I just didn't see anything in it that reminded me of ""Star Trek."" If I remember correctly, the series was about the happy results of Earth applying the thoughtful science and diplomacy brought by the Vulcans, in part, and, without being ravished by hunger, war, etc., focusing our energies on exploration and discovery. It was harmless fun with a message of hope. This film is disturbing to me because of what it does with Gene Rodenberry's message that we can be so much more if we can take control of ourselves instead of trying to control each other. In this new movie, there are no adult voices to counter all the violence and impulse. No one to voice that you can feel anything you wish to feel and chose to act in any way you wish to act, but there are consequences. This usually falls on the Vulcans but they seem to have decided to flush their philosophy and culture down the loo in order to enjoy kicking some ass. In this movie, no one grows up. I am sure with such success we will see another one of these things, oh well, to quote the new and improved Spock, ""Good Luck."""
"bane13579","4","27","40","16 May 2009"," Entertaining, too many flaws to ignore
","I consider myself a star trek fan, and have seen most of TNG and all of DS9. I've seen bits of TOS, Voyager, and Enterprise, and most of the movies. I'm not a die-hard fanatic of the lore, though, so I don't mind that they sidestepped most of it for a reboot. It does bring up some interested questions, but I don't really mind that they didn't mention them or address them. They have other movies and possibly shows for that. However, outside of the franchise reboot, there are SO many problems that make this a plain bad movie.<br/><br/>1. Pike, an active starship captain, in the middle of Iowa recruiting...in a bar? Because that seems likely.<br/><br/>2. ""Oh, all of our actually commissioned and graduated officers are off doing something else, *all* cadets, report for duty."" Yeah, that happens in a well organized, established military organization. It would simply be chaos, and would never happen in a modern navy, let alone a Navy 200 years in the future.<br/><br/>3. Uhura and Spock. Completely unexplained. This doesn't need to happen, at all. And if they decided it needed to happen, why was it so ridiculously presented?<br/><br/>4. Pike ""Looks like I've gotta leave the enterprise for the surefire trap. Spock, you're in charge. Stowaway Kirk, who hasn't actually graduated from the Academy yet, you're second in command. Yeah, existing senior bridge crew, you'll have to deal with it. There's now an immature 25 year old in charge."" <br/><br/>5. Chekov ""I'm a 17 year old genius! Also, I'm comic relief because Russians can't say the letter V, even 200+ years in the future! Get it?! I say W instead of V! Oh man, I'm hilarious and super smart! Oh, and also the most annoying person EVER!"" <br/><br/>6. J.J. Abrams ""Hey, I know what we can do! Let's start every third scene with the camera...sideways! That's SOOOO dramatic!"" <br/><br/>7. Federation female cadets wear short skirts. That's right, the one loyalty to the original show was the T&A. You would think that J.J. Abrams would have realized that was more of a 1960's era thing than a 2260's era thing. Oh, and the Uhura strip down scene. Not that I mind, because she was very attractive, but it felt very canned and was simply an excuse to get a bit more T&A in before the action started.<br/><br/>8. Vulcans ""We're an ancient and super advanced culture, both technologically and rationally. While our planet is being assaulted with a giant beam weapon, we're gonna hide out in a cave and meditate instead of doing something about it."" <br/><br/>9. Spock ""Kirk, you beat my program by cheating. I now have a giant personal grudge against you. Oh, and marooning you is the best solution. Don't argue with my logic, human. Have a good day."" Later ""Oh, I'm so mad at you Kirk! I'ma kill you!"" Later ""OK, Kirk, I was just kidding. Can I have my old job back?"" <br/><br/>10. Scotty ""I have a pointless comic relief sidekick. Isn't he cute!"" (as an aside, I loved Simon Pegg here. But his sidekick was unnecessary and unexplained.) <br/><br/>11. Starfleet ""Listen, Kirk, we all know you're fated to be a captain. Let's just skip the whole process where you graduate from the academy (and face charges of cheating, mind you), rise through the ranks, and earn your command. Nope, one successful mission is all it takes around here! Oh, and we'll give you our new flagship, too, because really, why wouldn't we!"" <br/><br/>Need I go on? There are so many stupid stupid things in this movie that are simply BAD WRITING that have nothing to do with the star trek lore."
"axellaj","5","37","57","8 May 2009"," Doesn't live up to the hype
","The guy who plays Kirk kind of looks like James Dean. He is brash and cocky, as you'd expect, and annoyingly arrogant (but that's his character). Zachary Quinto makes a good Spock. Leonard Nimoy seems to use the same dentist as Mr Ed did.<br/><br/>Naturally, there are lots of very good special effects. Uhura still dresses like a go-go dancer, and the men still wear those shirts with the padded shoulders (a la STTNG). Eddie Murphy will be amused to know that Kirk still doesn't get to ravish the green alien. Red shirts are still unsafe to wear.<br/><br/>At one stage, the Captain handed off command to Spock, who handed off to Kirk, who handed off to Uhura, who handed off to someone else, to sit in the Captain's chair. I was half-expecting to see the cleaning lady end up there.<br/><br/>I guess it was their attempt at humour to have a red-shirt die.<br/><br/>It always amused me how these kind of films have characters who are fascinated with our particular time in history and its accoutrements. Someone from hundreds of years in the future driving one of our cars would be kind of like us riding around in chariots. Kirk the kid driving around was simply a brat.<br/><br/>The concept of someone in their 20s becoming captain of a ship after a single mission, is something right out of The Young and the Restless (where the gardener can become CEO of a conglomerate in a short span of time).<br/><br/>I've gone to see other movies that I wasn't looking forward to - Start Trek IV rings a bell - and ended up enjoying it. This one, full of ST clichés, doesn't fall into that category at all. This film is not ""great"", as some have claimed, if you look at it as a non-Trekkie with your blinders off. In fact, I struggled to recall details to write this. It's that forgettable.<br/><br/>However, those who blindly love ST no matter what, should be pleased that Paramount has found yet another ST franchise with which to part them and their cash."
"maddog-50","1","16","22","1 October 2011"," Laws of Gravity....
","...in Hollywood: when you fail, you fall upwards.<br/><br/>Example: J.J. Abrams. I claim that J.J. is a rather untalented movie maker with no sense of cinematography whatsoever. He is a kind of Movie-DJ, putting together samples of ideas (mostly not his own ones...)from other sources, creating an easy to consume industry product. Surely, at first there is nothing wrong with that, as long as he can justify this way by making a lot of money. <br/><br/>Star Trek over the decades has became a cultural phenomenon, a whole universe of its own ideas, moral standards and way of proclaiming a bright future of mankind. For Roddenberry, Star trek was a vision of a way of live.<br/><br/>For J.J this vision is reduced to cool dudes and hot chicks on warp speed. The story of this movie is a patchwork of pieces. <br/><br/>We have a psychopathic villain with a father complex who lives with only a dozen crew members or so, in a gigantic space-ship (this ship has an insane amount of just empty space in it), where you have artificial gravity and a lot of slippery gangways and platforms with no railing. If you slip, you will fall to death hundreds of meters towards the gravity generator.<br/><br/>Anyway, the ship looks like a space incarnation of a Transylvania Vampire castle. The villain, how do we impersonate him... there he is, the Khan-villain, who does all the dirty work himself: putting little creatures into the body of hostages so that these poor fellows have to tell the truth. Never seen before, *cough*cough*, because this familiar looking species is NOT from Alpha Ceti V!<br/><br/>We have ice-planets with hairy monsters, suddenly eaten by bigger monsters. For everyone who never heard or saw anything of Star Wars, all this might have been a real surprise. The bigger snow-monster though is naked, who knows what that means?!If you want to get on an ice-planet for free, just to have cool mindless adventures with those kind of creatures, p* off your commanding officer of the Enterprise. <br/><br/>But p* him off at the very right time, otherwise the two snow-monsters wouldn't be there to chase you into a cave where Ol'Spock is already waiting for you and the plot could not go on then. I could bet, that J.J. was using some 'force' here to bring Kirk and Spock together so fatefully. <br/><br/>The bridge, or should i say, the i-Bridge of the Enterprise looked like an Apple-Store in heaven or so, arrrgh those bright lights...! Probably this bridge was designed as a plug to entertain the crew and not to bother them with technical, how-to-fly-a-spacecraft-nonsense. <br/><br/>The machine rooms were also very special: huge rooms, with a lot of empty and wasted space. Who cares, that the Enterprise could have been a third of its size without those machine rooms? (Yes, we know, that in future there will be no money and nobody has to pay for such design flaws). And we see a lot of huge as radioactive labeled oil-tanks with 20th century rotary valves. And there is some other cool stuff in the movie: lens flares! Woohoo! Yeah! Wow! Obviously this was J.J's. new toy! But for f* sake: You do not have to use them on every single screen shot, on every single light source! This is NO NOT cool anymore J.J! Thank God that J.J. already had his handshake-camera orgasm experience when he did Cloverfield. So this time, (yes we still have shaking cam here) it was quite moderate, for J.J.!<br/><br/>Genuineness at it's top, J.J. gave us something really never seen before: red, yes, not dark, not black, red (!) matter. So, what to do with red matter? Red matter, used correctly, creates, strange enough, black holes(!) and not as expected, the much more dangerous red ones. Rule 1: red matter placed INSIDE an empty (drilled before)space of an object generates a black black hole. Rule 2: red matter placed OUTSIDE somewhere in empty space generates a portal for time traveling. Rule 3: red matter placed OUTSIDE somewhere in empty space generates SOMETIMES a black hole too (hopefully only at the end of the movie, when it is convenient to kill the villain with his space-ship)<br/><br/>The character development and cast,... Power-Rangers in Space!<br/><br/>with personalities of a spoiled 13 year old doing their thing, hey, f* team play, f* the star fleet, yo! Best scene to show how J.J. wants to draw these characters: cool dude Kirk smacking eating an apple while cheating the Kobayashi Maru test. Brilliant J.J! <br/><br/>The drill scene: Sulu has NO phaser, Kirk has one BUT does not want to use it. So Sulu starts fighting with a sword, Kirk with his hands and feeds. Suddenly Kirk has the idea of using his phaser, but it got kicked immediately out of his hands. The third guy (probably with a phaser) got killed for the sake of convenience. ALL are wearing DIFFERENT colored suits, so that the stupidest retards can keep them apart. Now, that Kirk and Sucklu have NO phasers, they have to capture one from the enemies they have been fighting to make the drill kaput. Learning: You cannot destroy a gigantic drill with a sword! Aha!<br/><br/>The crew is also cool and stupid as sh*t: Uhura, the hot chocolate Ranger, Sulu, the ninja Ranger, Chekov, the Rump...er Russian Ranger, Scotty, the mechanist Ranger, Bones, the funny doctor Ranger and Spock, the horny nerd Ranger. This is what i call a Franchise reboot! Power Rangers Transform!!!! Where are the action figures, J.J?<br/><br/>Thanks Paramount, BTW, for betraying Gene's vision on the altar of commerce. Franchise fatigue is one thing for justifying a reboot of the Star Trek universe. But having done this by Jar Jar Abrams is complete insult to the non idiotic audience, if there is any."
"edwithmj","1","16","22","8 October 2010"," Another attempt to make Star Trek ""cool""
","After the awful Enterprise, this is another attempt at making Star Trek cool and appealing to a new audience. After watching this however, I would happily sit through the whole of Enterprise's four seasons. This is another attempt at rehashing a cheesy old series or film and making it ""cool"" for a new generation. This happened with Star Wars, The A-Team, Batman etc. I'm waiting for the Quantum Leap one next. Apparently, the overpaid executives in Hollywood are quickly running out of ideas for new material.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this film and I watched Star Trek: Nemesis (the last Next Generation film) beforehand to get me in the mood for it. What I watched disgusted me mainly because it wipes out everything that happened in The Original Series, The Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine and all of the films (I don't really care about Enterprise, whether they wiped out what happened in it or not). People seem to hate Star Trek Nemesis, but as a fan of The Next Generation, it really is a million times better than this rubbish.<br/><br/>The actors who portrayed the characters were chosen either because they looked like the originals or because they sounded like them. The man who played Kirk played him like a Jason Bourne character who was some sort of genius who is wasting his talents. New Kirk is such a hero that he can get beaten up by a super strength half-Vulcan and not walk away with a scratch let alone a black eye. They make New Kirk copy Tom Cruise from A Few Good Men by having the ""bad boy"" officer eat an apple while he's on duty. I didn't like it with Tom Cruise, why is it here? Somehow they resurrected the character of Christopher Pike who is now some sort of ace Captain who hangs around bars looking for losers to recruit into Starfleet. The man who played Chekov was just some man putting on a horrid Russian accent. He was chosen just because of the accent. He looks nothing like the original. They hired some random Asian to be Sulu (they all look alike apparently) and Sulu is now a ninja. Uhura was again just some random black woman except she wasn't a 60s type black woman but a 21st century ""gangsta"" type black woman complete with attitude and accent. She's also a genius except this time in languages. As soon as I saw Scotty I thought ""oh no not Simon Pegg."" He was good in Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead etc but really, he shouldn't be doing this; his Scottish accent was horrible and again, he looked nothing like the original. I have to give credit to the one who played McCoy as he almost had the same mannerisms as the original but they mucked up the character. This time he's a divorcée! He must have married young! His nickname of ""Bones"" is no longer a reference to his medical profession but because his ""divorce"" left him with nothing but his ""bones."" Is it me or is that the worst way a nickname has ever been acquired? Imagine if he'd said his divorce left him nothing but his clothes, would ""clothes"" be the new Kirk's nickname for him? Complete drivel. Lastly, Spock now has a history of being bullied because he's half human. Apparently even logical, emotionless Vulcans are capable of ""racism."" Oh yeah I forgot, the new gangsta Uhura and he are in love and keep kissing or something. I don't know I wasn't paying attention to it. This is supposed to be Star Trek. Still interested in watching this pap?<br/><br/>Onto the plot. Yes, it's time travel AGAIN. In the Star Treks the time travel episodes are the worst because they're a lame plot device to make anything happen and anything possible. Apparently a Romulan mining ship blames Spock for not saving his planet from an exploding star because Spock was too late. So he's gone back in time and exploded Vulcan as revenge. Why didn't he go back in time and save Romulus? No that's too simple. To do this he's acquired stuff called ""Red Matter."" What next for the sequel? Green Matter? Perhaps we can have a whole load of films with matters all the colours of the rainbow. I was cheering for the good guys to lose and was glad when Vulcan was destroyed as Vulcans aren't even how they should be anymore. Even Spock's father was saying how much he ""loves"" his wife and Spock removed himself from command because he was too emotional. Wrinkly Spock was talking about how he needs friends or something. What's happened????<br/><br/>The thing that made me cringe and which gave me surprise was Leonard Nimoy's appearance. Despite his entire past having been erased (and therefore he shouldn't exist), the same old wrinkly Leonard Nimoy Spock is still living long and prospering luckily on the exact random ice planet and luckily the almost same location onto which the new Kirk was jettisoned. What luck! Even luckier is that the new Scotty was on the same planet and nearby too! Damn, that was so lucky it must've been destiny! Apparently, this dreck of a film was good enough for wrinkly Spock to appear in but Star Trek: Generations wasn't? Perhaps they offered him more money I don't know. He's certainly ""sold out"" by appearing in this tripe.<br/><br/>I'm now going to purge my mind by watching a few old Original Series episodes. Avoid if you're a Star Trek fan. If you have time check out startrekxisucks.blogspot.com and read the ""100 reasons why it sucks."""
"fung0","3","16","22","16 July 2009"," Tripe, not Trek
","This movie is bad on so many levels, it's hard to know where to begin.<br/><br/>First off, it's lousy Trek; Gene Roddenberry would have hated it. It has NOTHING to do with ""going where no one has gone before"" or ""seeking out new life and new civilizations."" It has everything to do with blowing stuff up real good. But never mind - let's assume it's perfectly okay for a 'reboot' to dump *everything* that made the original worthwhile. That still leaves the inescapable fact that this new ""Star Trek"" doesn't work even as trashy melodrama. Let me itemize just a few points:<br/><br/>* Basing a film titled ""Star Trek"" on time travel is a textbook example of 'jumping the shark.' If our entire galaxy seems too small to provide sufficient plot hooks, screenwriters Orci and Kurtzman should seek some other line of work, better suited to boring dimwits totally devoid of imagination...<br/><br/>* ... and incapable of concocting even a rudimentary storyline. ""Nasty guy destroys planets"" isn't a story, it's just a really, really tired cliché. It's also exactly the sort of feeble plotting that killed the Enterprise series. You'd think someone would have noticed.<br/><br/>* Assuming you're short of ideas, why omit Kirk's three years at Star Fleet Academy? This is exactly the part of his life we know least about. (And while we're at it: why have Kirk beaten up, over and over and over? I count four or five separate pummelings. If it's some sort of in-joke, it's not funny... just distracting and tedious.)<br/><br/>* Getting down to plot: why does Star Fleet suddenly put all its cadets into active service? So... they have *ships*, apparently... but no crews??<br/><br/>* Why does Spock maroon Kirk on an obviously deadly planet? Doesn't the Enterprise have a BRIG?? And is this sort of ad hoc death sentence actually approved by Star Fleet regulations?<br/><br/>* How is it that Kirk arrives at a random spot on a random planet, then gets chased by a monster until he's thoroughly lost... then suddenly bumps into the one person in the galaxy who can solve all his problems??<br/><br/>* Isn't it just *slightly* implausible that Spock should abruptly resign his command, in favor of someone he apparently hates (and whom he recently sentenced to death), just because he loses his temper for a moment?<br/><br/>* Why does the Enterprise have ridiculously convoluted water pipes in its engine room, leading inevitably to a huge blender? This sequence with Scotty made me think of the far better film Galaxy Quest - which at least knew it was a spoof.<br/><br/>* And WHAT is it with the decor? None of the Enterprise interiors even remotely suggest a spacecraft of any kind. The new Bridge looks like a Hong Kong disco. <br/><br/>* When we get to the ending, didn't ANYONE else feel nauseous watching Kirk's obvious glee at the death of the Romulans?? At that moment, my sympathies were overwhelmingly with Nero, given that the Star Fleet jerks were being no less vengeful, and way more self-righteous about it. Never mind Roddenberry's grand vision of the future - the message here is that it feels SO GREAT to kill, when you're sure you've got the Right on your side. Just what the world needs: lynch-mob morality for the 21st Century.<br/><br/>* And then, the final insult: cadet Kirk gets his very own starship, day one. Without serving as, say, an Ensign, or a First Officer. Has this sort of thing *ever* happened in the history of the world's navies?? Fortunately, by this point there really isn't any credibility left to demolish.<br/><br/>When I heard JJ Abrams was doing a Star Trek movie, I knew it would not be like the traditional Trek. Boy, was I wrong. This movie fits perfectly into the tradition of goofball space opera, alongside such previous big-screen embarrassments as The Search for Spock, or The Voyage Home. (All of which fall light-years short of any of the TV shows.) What I DIDN'T expect, given Abrams' track record, is that the movie would fail on the level of basic storytelling.<br/><br/>I also have to say that reading through the IMDb trivia listings for this film really made me angry. Given that the film's creators obviously care nothing for the Trek tradition, the endless sly Trek references they've inserted can only be seen as a condescending effort to seduce the serious fans. Wake up, Trekkies: these guys are flaunting their utter contempt for you and everything you care about. They're not laughing with you, they're laughing at you... all the way to the bank.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I suppose this ""Star Trek"" isn't worth getting upset about - just one more bad pseudo-SF movie in an endless stream of brainless Hollywood space operas. But what really galls is this particular film's insane popularity, and the seemingly endless list of 10/10 ratings. I guess the movie-going public really will lap up anything with enough explosions in it. I'd thought that Trekkies might have higher standards, but again, use the names ""Kirk"" and ""Spock"" and I guess any sort of garbage becomes acceptable.<br/><br/>Slap all the perfect scores on it you like, garbage remains garbage. I give this film three stars purely for the obvious talent of its young cast. Too bad they're all going to be stuck repeating this cinematic disaster for the next ten years."
"ring_mordil","1","19","27","18 June 2009"," To go where everyone has went before
","As many have said before; I don't know what this was, but it wasn't Trek.<br/><br/>I know they called it a reboot (what a great excuse to hide the fact that they just didn't want to bother with writing a good film, isn't it?), but when the only similarities with the original lore and characters are names and, very crudely, the overall looks, why the hell even call it Star Trek? Only to sell more, nothing else. But let us ignore all the shameless plot holes and continuity errors, a Star Trek fan already knows about it and nobody else cares, and let us also ignore the errors in science etc, and just judge this as a movie in itself. I'll try not looking at it from a Trek fans view, and just look at it.<br/><br/>The acting was god awful in the case of oh so many actors, ""Kirk"" and ""Spock"" was among the worst ones. Simon Pegg and Leonard Nimoy is not enough to make a movie great. And the writers? HORRIBLE dialogues, lame plots filled with more holes than a Jarlsberg cheese. They wrote characters with no soul, and tried to cover it up by turning them into douche-bags and giving them the worst love-story subplots I've seen in ages. Usually they at least manage to get a semi-interesting villain, but even that was out of the question apparently. The directing was horrible, the editing and mix of genres was... bad, just really, really bad. You never got a sense of what was going on or what it was supposed to be. Not because it's hard to understand the movie, not at all, but because it was just so all over the place in so many ways. The effects were good but used way too much. Like a bowl of cereal, a little sugar can make it great, but once you've covered it all completely in sugar you know you'll throw up if you eat the whole thing. And what was with all the light-effects? I felt as if I almost had an epileptic seizure from watching this movie. The light shining through every single object whenever it had the chance, just another cheap, and poorly disguised, way of trying saving money on choreography (it happened during several fight-scenes) and hide poor acting. Not to mention all the blurring. Yes, I know, this is, in no way, anything new in modern cinema, but it is still as useless, annoying and idiotic as it has always been, and now it's overused as well. And to save even more money on the choreography during fight-scenes (hand to hand or ship to ship alike), they used the worst trick in the book; Shaky camera and quick view-switching. The editors must have been smoking something, or just doing what they all do now: Try to make money instead of a good movie. When a Steven Seagal movie is better, you know you done fudged up right? The score though had some great moments, which is the probably the only really great thing I can say about it.<br/><br/>Why does everyone, Abrahms and Bay are prime examples of this, try to make popcorn-movies. As everyone I can easily enjoy a movie that doesn't have a deep storyline or brilliant acting, but nowadays these ""grand and epic"" movies have no substance or value at all. It's all just explosion filled effects with random hormones and poor acting to amuse a popcorn-eating audience that doesn't even care. ""CGI killed the movie-value"", or something along those lines. This movie offered _nothing_ new, at all. I don't expect every movie to be original or anything, but it never hurts to at least _try_ to cover up the lack of originality.<br/><br/>Wall of text, yes I know. But I can sum this one up in three words: Effects, action, mind-numbing."

","I only went to see this film to see if my worst fears would be realized. Sometimes I hate being right. Why the rest of you elevated this crap past $100 million in revenue is beyond me.<br/><br/>This film fails in almost every area. Continuity being the worst failure. Casting is good, with the exception of Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>After nearly 1000 filmed episodes of Trek, many where time travel was featured, we are supposed to accept that Spock would allow some madman to change the past, destroy Vulcan, kill his mother, and just accept it, without taking a trip to the Guardian of Forever, or slingshotting around a star, or visiting Zarabeth, or sending an e-mail to Gary Seven.<br/><br/>The characterizations are nothing more than simplistic sketches of clichés worn out after 40 years. Sulu, fencing. Chekov, has a wery funny accent. Scotty...where was he? Kirk philanders, and is impulsive. Spock screws Uhura (what?). Uhura is so undeveloped as a character that she doesn't have a first name. McCoy is crabby......ugh!!!!!! And the 12 years Spock served under Pike on the Enterprise just forgotten. Where's Gary Mitchel? I could go on. Once was more than enough.<br/><br/>I've seen TMP at least 50 times, and it is just as wondrous and fulfilling as it was on 7 December 1979.<br/><br/>My disbelief with this film is not suspended for a second. This film is nothing but a cynical attempt by Paramount to keep all that produce (books, DVDs, TOS Remstered) selling to new generations of fans. But, fans of what? Remember when TOS was as topical and inventive as the Twilight Zone? Both series were written for adults. And Abrams, Kurtzman and Orci can certainly write at that level. Look at the quality of Fringe! This Star Trek may be popular, but Star Trek, it isn't."

""maybe the audience is dumb"". It tells/ reassures like that of the DiVinci's Code - they make sure they explain all the sequences.

"PateraSilk","3","14","19","25 September 2009"," Bad Science Fiction
","Very dumb and very disappointing. There are many things in this film that a hard-core Trekie will find objectionable, but playing fast and loose with legacy characters and situations isn't what disturbs me most about this film. The main problem is the script. I am a Sci-Fi fan from way back - both books and film - and there is nothing more irritating that the factual absurdities one always finds in marketing committee scripted Hollywood Sci-Fi flicks. I'm not talking about transporter tech or warp speed; I mean plot stupidities that absolutely destroy the credibility of the story being told. There are plenty of brilliant Sci-Fi writers around, so why are so many Sci-Fi film scripts written by people who think we're too dumb to spot the logical contradictions?<br/><br/>Here are just a few of the things that really irritated me about this film: <br/><br/>1) Spock goes to create a black hole at the heart of a star going supernova in an attempt to save Romulus from destruction; yet he isn't in time. The star was not Roumuls's home star but that of a nearby(?) system. So how is it that the warp-drive possessing Romulans were caught off guard by the sub light-speed shock wave? And is the Romulan's understanding of astrophysics so primitive that they didn't know centuries in advance that the star was unstable? How is it that the Roumulans had no off-world colonies to survive the destruction of the home planet? <br/><br/>2) Nero attacks both Earth and Vulcan with his mining ship, dropping his cabled mining mechanism into the atmosphere of both planets to first drill a hole to the planetary core and then initiating a black hole by means of the ridiculous 'red matter'. How is it that 23rd century Earth and the even more advanced Vulcan didn't possess the military capability to shoot a tethered mining platform out of the sky?! A 20th century airplane could have done the job. During the attack, both humans and Vulcans run about like clueless Chicken Littles while this silly tether goes about it's business. Nero would have met no less opposition had he attacked 5th century BC Greece.<br/><br/>3) When Kirk stumbles open the aging Spock on the planet Whatever, there is a flashback of Spock watching Vulcan being destroyed when he first arrived there. The planet is about the same size in the sky as the moon seen from the earth. That means this M-class planet is in the same system as Vulcan and very close to it as well. Yet on this planet there don't seem to be any Vulcans or any tech, just a Federation station peopled with one human his alien sidekick. And again, how is it that the Vulcans don't possess any off-world colonies to continue Vulcan civilization?<br/><br/>4) Then there is the ridiculous time-traveling plot where the Romulan Nero is so enraged at Spock for not saving Romulus that he decides to destroy Earth and Vulcan. How dumb is that?! And if Nero was able to travel 100+ years back in the past, why not just warn his fellow Romulans about the impending disaster with the super nova??!! <br/><br/>What we're they thinking when they scripted this piece of garbage?"

"groundhog1021","4","29","44","10 May 2009"," Star Trek is Dead
","I've been a Star Trek fan since 1974. Though I looked forward to this movie, I thought the choice of J.J. Abrams as director was questionable. Abrams was quoted as saying he was ""not a huge fan to begin with"" and that the series ""seemed to promise adventure more than it would deliver."" <br/><br/>Arrogant words from someone about to direct the eleventh feature film based on this seriesand that's not counting four spin-offs. Despite Abram's opinions and the commercial disappointment of recent Trek efforts, Star Trek worked for a lot of people before he came along.<br/><br/>I saw the new Trek movie on opening day, and my worst apprehensions were justified. Just as troubling, critics are slobbering over this movie, claiming it's a ""reboot"" that both fans and newcomers will love. This fan left the theater vowing never to see another Trek movie produced by this team. Abrams took a series which I've happily enjoyed since childhood, twisted it into his own mass-market ""vision,"" and insultingly claimed that it's a bridge between old fans and new.<br/><br/>Here's a breakdown of my impressions:<br/><br/>The good:  The movie was well cast and well acted. Main characters were more or less consistent with their original series counterparts (with one notable exception).  Little homage moments were great. Particularly good was the inclusion of Kirk's ""solution"" to the Kobayashi Maru test.  Humor was good (though I stopped laughing midway through).  Leonard Nimoy was excellent and his role was neither awkward nor contrived.  The space battles were exciting, if a bit chaotic.  The new ship, equipment and uniforms were attractive (though hard-core Trekkies may be unhappy with the often extreme departures from original series' art design).<br/><br/>The horrible:  The villain, though well cast, was utterly two-dimensional. It's difficult to understand why Abrams did not include the excellent prequel material that was released as a graphic novel. In the prequel, Nero was a decent man who tried to do the right thing. In the end, he felt betrayed by his government, by Spock, and indeed, by all of Vulcan. Worse, he lost his family when Romulus exploded. But we didn't get to see all that, so Nero comes across as a cardboard cutout villain whose only purpose is to serve as a foil for the heroes. Weak, lazy writing.<br/><br/> Spock and Uhura necking like pubescent teens, and doing so in front of others, was simply preposterous. I'm not slavishly devoted to every detail of Trek lore, but the dignified, self-possessed Spock portrayed by Leonard Nimoy would never be romantically involved in that way, and even if he was, he would never kiss his girlfriend in public. In every other way, Zachary Quinto did a great job playing young Spock (though I found the more extreme emotional outbursts unrealistic). The sub-plot romance between Spock and Uhura was a juvenile, ridiculous distraction, presumably aimed at widening the audience demographic.<br/><br/> Any respectable Star Trek fan can accept a time travel plot, even when it contains contradictions. But Abrams and the writers (who ironically claim to be Trek fans) use time travel to excuse their heinous molestation of Star Trek lore. Follow me hereNero coming back in time and killing Kirk's father would only affect Kirk's childhood at that time. It wouldn't affect the entire universe (although Nero's later acts of destruction would). The writer's try to convince us that Nero is responsible for an entirely new alternate time line, before he'd actually destroyed Vulcan. That's careless, dishonest plotting.<br/><br/> Small deviations from the original series' details were irritating because they were unnecessary. The most notable: Vulcan's sky was blue in the movie. Vulcan orbits a red giant, making its sky red. This large, red sun has much to do with the physical characteristics of the Vulcan people (great strength, being used to thin air and heat, pointed ears, etc.). It was irritating for the writers to pay so much attention to some details, and ignore others.<br/><br/> They. Blew. Up. Vulcan. Are you kidding me? How sick do you have to be to blow up Vulcan and its six billion inhabitants as part of your plot? What's next? Will they shoot Scotty out the Enterprise's tailpipe in the next movie? I watch TV shows and movies to be entertained. The good guys should win, the bad guys should lose. There's comfort in knowing that there are certain aspects of a show that you can count on. Not anymore. Modern entertainment has taught us that no character is safe, no matter how central he/she is to the plot. Sure, they killed Spock in Star Trek IIbut they brought him back in III. They destroyed the Enterprise in Star Trek III, but they built a cool new one in IV. In the new Trek movie, I kept waiting for the whatchamacallit that would set everything right. But no. Kirk's dad and Spock's mom were still dead, Vulcan was still gone. And this one plot point, more than any of the movie's other flaws, was what lost me. <br/><br/>I could bear most of the other annoyances in light of what was otherwise a fun movie, but it was clear that Abrams had no respect for the vast amount of back-story established by the original series. In setting such important material aside, he insulted the very fans who gave him the opportunity to direct this film. The effects were cool, and it was fun to see the crew come together. But in the end, I left the theater feeling betrayed. I'll always have the series and the first ten movies, but if this is the direction Star Trek is taking, they will boldly go on without me."
"jon11-2","6","37","58","9 May 2009"," Meh- We could have tried harder.
","I'd like to say it was awesome. At moments, it was. It was like...Star Trek, meets Star Wars, meets Sliders. One thing was clear to me as the action progressed and and Starfleet was described as a ""Peacekeeping Armada"" and thousands of photon torpedoes crashed about in confusing but dazzling collisions...Gene Roddenberry's vision of a peaceful future involving the exploration of strange new worlds as explorers...not conquerors, has been flushed; along with Planet Vulcan, Spock's mom, and my hope for the future of the franchise. This seemed more like what NBC originally wanted Trek to be, but Gene fought tooth and nail to keep it from becoming, a special effects slug-fest with very little in the way of substance.<br/><br/>I'd like to say it was well directed. But,I saw Kirk duck behind the same piece of scenery twice. I saw him with the wrong prop gun once. I saw Jim Kirk get smacked around by Spock and several Romulans(who have the strength of 10 men when angered)and barely get knocked back five feet. And,while I have no problem with Uhura kissing Spock...I have a HUGE problem with Spock kissing Uhura back(He only fell in love once, and it nearly killed him - but you'd have to hire a director who was FAMILIAR with the franchise to know better(no offense to you JJ - I would have taken the job sight unseen as well, I suppose). The action scenes were nearly indiscernible (between the rapid, confusing, cutting and the camera shake).<br/><br/>Look, I love Sci-Fi. I have no problem with changing time-lines, alternate realities, or time-travel Paradox changing the way things ""are,"" some of those changes were NOT caused by a temporal paradox, but caused, clearly, by some kind of studio paradox. Watch the series before you make a movie about it. Cite: Checkov joined the Enterprise crew fresh out of the Acadamy...second season of the series. He never attended her maiden voyage, even in a paradox...he hadn't joined Starfleet yet(and his accent was painful). ""Bones"" was called Bones because he was so skinny. Hello? Did we watch the series we were making a movie about? Oh, right. We didn't. The mistake shines throughout the entire picture. Every time I started to get captivated (and I did) Some serious dogmatic hole would be there to puncture my experience. This is not about cheesing off old fans...it's about doing your homework as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>What, exactly did the Romulans DO for 25 years, waiting for spock? Contemplate the enormous plot-hole they were leaving?<br/><br/>The film was not a sore disappointment, but not a triumph either; Certainly not an appropriate ""resurrection"" More like a confused Zombie trying to figure out where to go next.<br/><br/>I'll say this much, they DID boldly go where no one has gone before...to the space opera. Good luck, guys."

The Motion Picture up to Search for Spock are superb, but this new film won't be remembered. The stand out points are the effects. The CGI doesn't look overdone. The Enterprise looks fantastic. Cast standouts for me are Spock, McCoy, and sexy Uhura. Cast downer's are Kirk, ridiculous sounding Checkov and the rest of the hammy cast including the original Spock. Simon Pegg as Scotty is good but isn't perfect casting. The bad guys didn't look alien enough to me. More like biker's with tattoos! There is also the usual American rock track included to make matters worse. The deep Vulcan bits drag on terribly too. This film is only for hard-core Trekkie's. I won't be in a rush to watch this again. Weak plot with lot's of padding. No doubt I will get a grilling off the Star Trek fan club and shot down with phaser's for this."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","497","922","26 April 2009"," Thrilling adventure with great characters, maintains the spirit of the original series while appealing to a mass audience. A landmark blockbuster for sure
","I'm a fan of ""Star Trek"", but not obsessive, having read only one ""Star Trek"" novel, owning no merchandise and only TOS in its entirety on DVD. I abhor ""Voyager"" but like every other Trek series, including ""Enterprise"" although nearly all of that show's especially good episodes are in the fourth season. My favorite remains TOS for its unforgettable characters, performances and stories, as well as the sense of camaraderie aboard the Enterprise.<br/><br/>I hope I've established my feelings on Trek (after all there are Trekkers who think ""The Motion Picture"" is the best Trek film, and a lot of people seem to like ""Nemesis"") and what I truly value in it. As long as it wasn't overwhelmingly dumb I didn't require any sort of truly thoughtful sci-fi in this film, nor did I expect it. What I desired, what I can say with a deep, deep sigh of relief, I got, is a film brimming with confidence, energy, a sense of adventure, a suitably emotional story for the film's main characters, and, thank heavens, superb characterization.<br/><br/>Using a plot device bring Nero, our Romulan villain played by Eric Bana, and Nimoy's Old Spock into the film, the writers Bob Orci and Alex Kurtzman maintain canon. While Trekkers will whinge about many things here no more canon contradiction happens here than in the Trek series following TOS. Instead of merely rebooting the series entirely and creating an entirely separate canon, the writers have fairly deftly worked this film into the existing Star Trek universe. It's an alternate (not mirror) universe story done well. A great deal to enjoy for Trekkers with throwbacks to the originals but there's also a lot to satisfy summer movie-goers. It's a very, very fast-paced film, the action scenes are exhilarating (and you can actually keep track of them), and there's a great deal of humor<br/><br/>It sounds almost unbelievable but they've actually managed to pull it off: they've made a ""Star Trek"" film which is a Trek film through and through and yet will still draw a bigger audience than any of the previous films, and moreover satisfy that audience. The film has been compared to ""Iron Man"" in more than one review the similarities are clear. Both films feature excellent dialogue and character interactions, swift, clever characterization, a minimum of laborious exposition, and also have a common flaw: a rushed plot which overall is almost a side plot. The only reboot to truly escape this pitfall thus far is ""Casino Royale"", which successfully told a very tight story and also consistently developed Bond as a character. Bana is menacing enough and his ship is well-designed but overall he's no Khan or Chang and was much better-written in the Countdown prequel comic than in the film itself. There are also a series of massive contrivances to get everything where it needs to be which will have viewers rolling their eyes, but even these are handled well by the script, which is smooth and fast as opposed to clunky and sterile. Plus, they're necessary for this origin story not to be a typical boring origin story and become what it is.<br/><br/>The partnership of director Abrams and cinematographer Mindel will annoy some people with their deliberate use of lens flares as well as shaky cam in scenes (not in a Greengrass or worse, Peter Berg style, but merely a slightly unstable camera), but overall I found it to be consistently involving and thrilling to watch, with good visual storytelling throughout. I also quite enjoyed the lens flares. It's not quite on par with Nicholas Meyer's attempts for me but still good, and interesting. The score by Michael Giacchino suffers from familiarity and a lack of individual identity, but works well with the film itself.<br/><br/>Chris Pine is absolutely terrific as Kirk, doing so much more than a Shatner impression and creating something of his own character (and it is, after all, an alternate Kirk) while absolutely nailing several of the trademark attitudes and behavior of the Kirk we all know and love. Much more than a pretty face, Pine's in for mega-stardom after this. Quinto's Spock is really quite terrific and much more nuanced than expected, and Spock's emotional story (and backstory) in the film is well-written as is Kirk's (though Spock gets a more emotional and better overall arc for sure). Pegg is fantastic as Scotty, used here mostly as comic relief. Urban's McCoy is the closest to an impersonation but overall just a joy and a pleasure to behold. Cho's alright as Sulu, who doesn't really get much to do (heck, when did he ever?), though Uhura is surprisingly prominent and well-played by Zoe Saldana. Yelchin as Chekhov is the only really problematic casting choice for me, he really overdoes the accent and takes you out of the film a bit. Bruce Greenwood as Pike nails the character and in a crucial role Leonard Nimoy shines yet again as Spock.<br/><br/>Abrams' ""Star Trek"" isn't quite tight enough and emotional enough to compete with ""The Wrath of Khan"", isn't as much fun for me as ""The Voyage Home"", but overall is probably the third best Trek film to date, on par with ""The Undiscovered Country"". It's a fairly new direction, yet totally faithful to Trek where it needs to be: in spirit. In a world of dreary blockbusters and 'dark' reboots, this Trek, though grittier in terms of design than anything before, shines, from opening to closing, as an example of optimistic, exciting, thrilling, humorous, and thoroughly enjoyable adventure cinema, as well as a great addition to Trek's long, long history."

"Cobra_Unit","4","100","173","7 May 2009"," The Right Fluff
","The JJ Abrams reboot/relaunch of Star Trek, albeit entertaining, suffers from being more of a space opera than the bona fide science-fiction movie we were promised. The movie knocks off the first Star Wars sometimes so closely one wonders if the scribes (""writers"" might be an overstatement) are really interested in relaunching Star Trek or simply remaking A New Hope. Not quite ""Star Wreck"", to be fair... but damn close.<br/><br/>As it is, the story follows a young prodigy - son of a legendary pilot - vegetating in the countryside and fulfilling his destiny by joining the Academy with a ragtag group of newcomers. This, only to wage a battle to destroy a planet-blasting secret weapon whose weak spot is the ever-convenient deactivated force field, while learning the basics of the Force (er, sorry, the basics of beaming one at warp speed!)... Hell, even the swordfights are here, so is the girl who (spoiler) ultimately hooks up with the *other* guy. (spoiler end)<br/><br/>I've only seen a couple of 80's Trek films and zero episode of the TV show so I don't qualify as a trekkie but as a regular joe I thought it was lacking, on top of being derivative. Actors are mostly OK (except Yelchin and Pegg who were just silly and annoying; props to Pine, Quinto, Cho, Saldana, Urban and Greenwood though), the score is fabulous and the artistic direction top-notch. But I thought Abrams did a very average and gimmicky job, the baddie is uninteresting and lacks any sense of menace, the humor is childish and the action limp (save for the fantastic opening sequence).<br/><br/>As for the humanistic and ""adult"" view of the space exploration inherent to the sci-fi genre, don't count on it: everything that was deemed ""uncool"" (ie: remotely clever) has been flushed out and the very last fight, on that aspect, left me scratching my head as (spoiler) I fail to see how ""cool"" - or humanistic, for that matter - it is to carpet bomb a wounded, black hole-stuck baddie who doesn't represent a threat anymore... (spoiler end)<br/><br/>To me, this is the Iron Man of 2009: a sure-fire box office hit whose upsides (the cast and the visual effects) cannot overcome its shallow plot and ""all fluff, no stuff"" attitude. Entertaining, but utterly forgettable."
"stephen-560-161818","1","21","31","23 October 2009"," This is not worthy of the name
","This film has so many problems that its hard to know where to begin. This could be quite long so please bear with me.<br/><br/>As a sci-fi fan I can accept if not particularly like time travel and alternative reality stories. These are certainly nothing new to the Enterprise. However in order to be a part of a chronicle one thing must not be changed and that's the basic concepts and themes that defines it as being what it is.<br/><br/>For those who aren't avid fans of the genre lets expand a little on 2 distinct and often confused categories (Space Opera and Science Fiction): <br/><br/>Star Wars is high fantasy set in space, like classical high fantasy, it is about larger than life characters achieving improbable feats, and science or even realistic pseudoscience had no real place in it. It worked because of the high drama and the heroic battle between good and evil. The fact that it was in a futuristic setting was almost incidental to its theme. Here big explosions and implausible action scenes were natural and proper. In true heroic fantasy tradition you aspire to be the heroes of the saga. This is the quintessential Space Opera.<br/><br/>Star Trek on the other hand has always been much more about the science, the exploration of space and ideas; the rational and moralistic decisions that the crew had to make. This was what made Star Trek what it was. Moreover it was about hope of humankind overcoming its propensity towards irrational and violent solutions in favour of enlightened and peaceful ones. Star Trek is Science Fiction, set in Space, it differs fundamentally to Space Opera because in Science Fiction, the science, or at least rational thinking is an integral part of the story. In Science Fiction you aspire to be part of the world, not necessarily be any of the characters.<br/><br/>These 2 distinctions are very important in discussing this. This is Space Opera in virtually every sense. Changing that caused many of the problems, because to do so, the original had to be completely destroyed or distorted. I'm not just talking about the original future. I'm talking about the past, present and future. To create the storyline they wanted they had to completely destroy Roddenberry's vision. The reason being that the hero's of the original Federation were rational thinkers, not classical heroes.<br/><br/>Thus gone is the Federation who seek to make peaceful first contact with Aliens, who use violence only as a last resort. In its place is a militant group of idiots, who give control of the Enterprise to a bunch of Cadets because they are the heroes. One of which is promoted to captain, because it's his destiny. In the original federation, this would be impossible, because its leaders respected experience and wisdom, rather than bravado and simple heroism, in TOS, Kirk for instance could be heroic, but it wasn't this which made him a worthy captain, it was his experience and intelligence, combined with his strong will.<br/><br/>Gone are any things which promote thought, or discussion. Gone is the science. In its place are the bad jokes, the clichéd lines and mind pummelling action scene sequences where plot takes a backseat. In are the improbable events that Space Opera thrives upon, because it's about the hero winning the day in the most heroic way, rather than the expedient way.<br/><br/>In itself this wasn't completely fatal, if you weren't a fan, but the problems don't stop there. The plot line makes no kind of sense whatsoever and the haphazardly arranged scenes don't fit together into a cohesive whole. Furthermore they lack any kind of rationality even within themselves. Why do the Romulans step out with mêlée weapons? The only point is to have Sulu fighting a sword duel with a unlikely but fantastical backdrop. Furthermore, it fails in its requirement to make you aspire to be any of the characters in it.<br/><br/>Technical: The effects are good, but the camera work is overly frantic and confusing. You come out feeling like you've got motion sickness. The sounds are too loud and not well thought out; brash and crass rather than subtle and aesthetically pleasing.<br/><br/>The set design is awful and lacks a relationship back to the original and this if nothing else is criminal. Seeing as the Enterprise is the iconic prop of the series. To give them their due, the externals were great, but the bridge arrangement, is also iconic for Star Trek, the new bridge is just too different and don't mention engineering.<br/><br/>The acting is OK but few bared more than a passing relationship to their namesakes. I could deal with the changes to Kirk (ignoring plot holes), after all he's had a different upbringing. But the others had no right to be so different. Their time lines were unlikely to have changed drastically because Kirk's dad died. So we now have Uhura the Slut, an emotionally unstable Spock and an incompetent Scotty. This isn't the actors faults this is the plot line's fault.<br/><br/>The end result is a film which pummels you all over, numbs you with effects and that's it. There is no substance and the plot doesn't hold together. Not that it matters seeing as you're not given the chance to think about it or follow it, before the next scene kicks in, more often than not coupled with expensive effects. The film is designed to cater for the lowest common denominator, preventing the need for and indeed preventing any thought.<br/><br/>In conclusion: This is a mediocre film by itself and would have got a 4 or perhaps a 5 if I was feeling generous. The fact however that they dared to title it Star Trek whilst fundamentally changing everything without providing a decent replacement, means that a score of 1 is generous. This wasn't just 'not your Daddie's Star Trek' it wasn't Star Trek at all."

"rjyelverton","5","21","31","17 May 2009"," Dumbed down Trek
","It wasn't until I was sorting through my feelings about the new Star Trek film that I realized how much I actually did care about and enjoy the Trek universe. Star Trek is something my dad loved and so as a kid I tried to love, too. The original show never did much for me as the bad sets, pacing, and dated look of it all kept me at a distance. But in the flashier, bigger-budgeted movies, I found a Star Trek my father and I could both enjoy. Star Trek II and VI are great movies and there are bits in all the rest that I like.<br/><br/>It was ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", however, that I really loved--still do--and it made me a lifelong appreciator of the Trek films and shows. The acting was much improved, the special effects pretty good, and the science fiction concepts often fascinating but palatable. I do not consider the Star Trek universe perfect in its entirety--some of the movies are horrible--but I do have a basic grasp of Trek-ness. And JJ Abrams dumps much of what makes Trek tick and delivers a big, fast moving cartoon of a film. As promised, this is not your father's Star Trek.<br/><br/>It's also not very good. The script is an arbitrary mish-mash of sci-fi-ish ideas that allows Abrams to rejigger the Trek-verse however he sees fit. Fair enough. Star Trek has just as many bad entries as good so it's hardly an unassailable canon. But even the worst Trek is usually built around a solid, sometimes tired, sci-fi idea. What does it mean to be human? What is intelligence? Does God exist? Who is God? Should we play God? The new Star Trek pays lip service to some of these themes, but the script mostly moves us from one action set piece to another. It's serviceable and explosion-y, but very typical summer fare. Loud and dumb.<br/><br/>The constant silliness of the film was also a disappointment. The captain's hands swell to enormous size due to allergies. The ship's engineer experiences an Augustus Gloop-esquire ride through the ship's water system. An Ewok type figure offers reaction shots to the constant space shenanigans. All this leads to a film that is more ""Galaxy Quest""--an actually not anywhere near as good as ""Galaxy Quest""--than Star Trek. And the action scenes while big and fast left me cold.<br/><br/>There's worse ways to spend a hot summer night than ""Star Trek"", but far better ways, too."
"beastwarsfan","7","96","167","1 May 2009"," Star Trek lives long, but does it prosper?
","I got an invitation for the Bulgarian (pre)premiere of the new Star Trek and I saw it on April 27. It is an OK movie, but I feel that Star Trek and its fans deserve more.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a kick. Some huge and really advanced Romulan ship encounters a federation ship. The Romulan captain Nero is searching for Spock, but nobody has ever heard of him, and the Romulans lose their temper right away and kill the captain. The new captain is now Kirk Sr. who takes control over the Federation vehicle and sacrificing both the ship and his life rams himself into the Romulans, saving the lives of thousands of people, including his wife and newborn son - James Tiberius Kirk. Kirk the father flying towards his certain but heroic death while listening to his wife giving birth to his son, now this was some epic drama.<br/><br/>We see James T. Kirk racing down a country road in a stolen retro car, listening to the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" while being chased by some flying traffic cop, which was a cool scene, though completely irrelevant for the story.<br/><br/>We see young Spock teased and picked on in Vulcan school (I didn't know the Vulcan's have bullies at school as well) and having troubles because of having a human mother.<br/><br/>Then as expected Kirk has grown into a rebellious teen/young adult, and he is trying to use his charm on Uhura at a bar, in the process finds himself in a fight with four Federation cadets, and after being badly beaten is recruited by his father's old friend Captain Christopher Pike.<br/><br/>Little by little we see all the rest of the familiar crew - Dr. McCoy, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty and so on, and I admit that it's really fun to see them while they take their first steps towards the final frontier.<br/><br/>And from this point on the movie is quite predictable, there are no serious plot twists (but there are a number of plot holes).<br/><br/>Comes out that the Romulans are some angry miners from the future who are after Spock who didn't save their planet from annihilation. After seeing the end of their world they came back in time to get their hands on Spock, planning to destroy Vulcan and make him watch. Spock on the other hand came back in time hoping to make things right somehow. But the Romulans came like 25 years before Spock and when hey didn't find him it all ended with the death of Kirk's father.<br/><br/>Now the Romulans are here again, 25 years later, back in tie with a vengeance, creating a black whole that engulfs Vulcan among with Syler's... pardon me, Spock's mother. Captain Christopher Pike is captured, they want him to give them some security codes so they can do to Earth the same they did to Vulcan, and it is up to Spock and Kirk to stop them. I mean... it is up to Spock, Kirk and Spock to stop them.<br/><br/>The old Spock from the future is here now, helping Kirk to become a captain of the Enterprise, telling Scotty the beaming formula he is supposed to discover himself some years later, and telling the young Spock that he is actually Spock too...<br/><br/>Guess what? All this creates an alternative universe. That's the excuse they came up with for the reboot.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a good way to waste two hours, but it is nothing memorable. The main flaw is the unnecessary use of shaky camera and unstable frames. I know they use it all the time nowadays and we see it in like every action movie, but still it is not an excuse. I guess this is the way they want to create pace and make it more dynamic, but actually when you walk out of the cinema I wouldn't be surprised if you have a headache. The constant twitches are really annoying, and they were used even in simple dialog scenes. I really can't understand why they shake the camera so much and in some scenes it just made absolutely no sense. I mean, come on, you spent millions of dollars on sets and CGI, give me some static shot, stand still for a while and let us enjoy the view! Otherwise we have to wait for the DVD and push the Pause button, hoping that the creature or the spaceship will be on focus and we will be able to see some more details.<br/><br/>Speaking of CGI for millions of dollars... they created black wholes engulfing planets and giant alien monsters chasing Kirk through a snowy wasteland, but they didn't add steam coming out of their mouths. When it's cold and you breathe there is usually steam coming out of your mouth I wonder why there wasn't any while Kirk and Spock were in an ice cave... It's not the only movie where they make this mistake, but it's really annoying when you notice it and makes the whole snowy set look fake.<br/><br/>But let's point out some good things as well - fan service! The short skirt uniforms, Uhura is hot and there is a green-skinned Orion slave girl! Well, it's not like a blue Twilek babe, but after all it's only Star Trek ;) The best is that the ending pays homage to the original series and they finally play a motif from the Star Trek theme. I have absolutely no idea why they didn't use it throughout the whole movie, the old Star Trek soundtracks have brilliant themes and I think they should have used them."

","Seriously, i am not an avid star trek fan, in fact this was the first time i saw something related to this show. But i am a huge fan of sci-fi. I saw and read literally hundreds of sci-fi's in my life, and somehow i always avoided star trek. Now that i finished watching this movie i say 2 things: 1. I think i understand now why so many people like the original series. 2. I think the world really gone mad, since i cant explain otherwise how on earth this movie can be rated 8.2 on IMDb. Come on people is taste and expectations really this low nowadays? Have you ever heard about Philip K. Dick or for example Neil Gaiman??? I don't think so. You never saw them in commercials or IMAX theaters, so they don't exist huh? They don't sell giga-mega sized popcorns with quality. Too bad. Everything, which was great in this movie, the uniqeness of the characters, the feeling of companionship, friendship, and caring amongst them, which you almost could touch, it was great. But i suppose, it was great, because they already existed in the series. Okay the special effects were good, but. BUT: did you stop thinking for one minute? Did it occurred to you how incredible stupid the plot was? How easily everything got solved?<br/><br/>Just one example: They throw out Kirk. He lands in the same planet into which the bad guys threw out future Spock. FUTURE SPOCK i repeat slowly... An ape thing chases Kirk. Then a giant bug-like monster kills the ape-thing for no good reason, and don't eats it. No. Why eat tons and i mean TONS of good meat when you can eat a strange, 80 KILOgramm man too. So the monster chases Kirk. And what a miracle...they ran into future Spock, who scares off the GIANT monster, with a little fire....Yeah sure....And then they go to a station, which is more like a junkyard...And what surprise, a mad genius lives there, and future Spock, who came back from the future (129 years)know him. Hey hy! You are the mad genius who will invent the only one thing that can help us. Can you please hurry and invent it like right now. Of course he can. In a station, not a lab or something, in a station, where they don't even have food. But they have material to build intergalactic lightspeed jumping machine.....YAY!!!! Do I really need to go on?<br/><br/>Did you ever stopped and thought about how childish, stupid, incoherent this all thing was????? Wait, i didn't even say childish, because some people will say, this is a sci-fi what do you expected...Which is bullc..... by the way, because there are plenty of intellectual sci-fis too. Not because of it is childish, but because a sci-fi is good, when it makes a world in which you can believe. Even if it has other rules then our own, it has LOGICAL, BELIEVABLE rules in their own surroundings...Now that is the thing this movie fails terrible at.<br/><br/>This whole thing is a big own goal. It really has so much potential. It was good for one thing thou. I will download and watch the original series. And i am sure it will be fun."

","i just came back from the theater and i thought it was mildly entertaining, poorly acted and not star trek. It also fails at its attempts at humor and it does it too often. The ships don't look like anything we have ever seen on star trek, same for the weapons, the enterprise bridge looks like an Apple store. The story is very poor and more often than not we're left watching parts that don't really contribute to the advancement of the plot like battles with huge monsters or other mindless nonsense. I suspect that the only actor who has ever watched an episode of star trek is the guy who plays kirk, the other characters with exception of spock are just comedic side characters à la jar jar binks. and spock & uhura?! come on... I would give the first 30 minutes a 6/10 and the last 2 hours a 3.5/10. The only thing decent is the space battles and we don't see much of that."

My husband took me along to the premier of Star Trek in London last night and thank you JJ you converted him in one film, I have been trying for 25 years! What JJ Abrams has done is create a film that can be enjoyed by all, its irrelevant whether or not you have seen Star Trek before, this film stands alone as brilliant entertainment. There are plenty of references to the original series to keep the fans happy. Of course there are going to be the ""hard core"" fans who will criticize certain aspects. I enjoyed seeing the lead actors imitate the characteristics of the original crew, Karl Urban as Dr Mcoy was particularly good. Good story line, plenty of humour, non-stop fast action, fantastic special effects, great acting from all the main ""crew"", Zacchary Quinto and Chris Pine especially. Can't wait for the next one to see more in-depth character development (of all the characters, not just Kirk and Spock and a moral dilemma which is at the heart of the best Star Trek.

","I could care less about the plot of this film as it is no worse than any other of the lesser scripts throughout the ST films, a dumb threat from some as yet unknown enemy with revenge in mind (sound like ST2?) What really bugs me as a casual fan of ST but still very knowledgeable of the series and movies, how could you not be, is the hokey caricatures of the crew. Every one of them sound or look nothing like the originals did. I understand they did not want exact look-a-likes but the voices are so off it's embarrassing. And why does Kirk have bad skin and scars? <br/><br/>When the original series came out in 1966 the cast was in their 30's, only 12 or so years older then the new films crew yet they act nothing like them, are they saying their personalities all changed so drastically in ten years?. Spock sounds nothing like Spock etc etc. But the worst has to be Sulu who has such a distinctive voice they should at least tried to make it close, why not just have a black guy with a French accent play him.<br/><br/>But I guess this is what happens when the new Hollywood just keeps remaking things instead of creating something new, you can't have it both ways, if your going to recreate a classic character from films past, it has to be the same, not some actors interpretation."

Enterprise in a corn field, man shooting through water tubes in the brewery, er I mean, engine room, red shirt's getting killed needlessly, etc.<br/><br/>Abrams I think saw more ""Saturday Night Live"" like sketch comedies than he did episodes.<br/><br/>I think if the movie had been made by any other director, and one with a less active hype machine, this movie would have been panned and dismissed as the poor execution that it was."
"roberthannah89","6","8","10","2 July 2012"," Hyperactive, Nonsensical
","Just a few short remarks:<br/><br/>-They attempt to transpose our beloved 1960s Star Trek characters into 2009 for a new audience. They do so by by creating a ""bad-ass"" intro for Kirk pretty much indistinguishable from the initial scenes with the young John Connor in Terminator 2. This kid that looks like Macaulay Culkin steals his step-father's convertible and gets into a police chase, etc. I appreciate what they're trying to do, but it's just so dumb I couldn't stand to watch...<br/><br/>-With about 45 seconds, he is all grown up, and in a bar, trying to chat up a young Uhura. He gets into a fight, and then like 2 minutes later, he's on a star ship, having been recruited (and presumably trained?) in that time. In an addition 30 seconds, he and Leonard McCoy are BFFs. This leads to the natural conclusion that the movie was scripted in between lines of cocaine or some other strong stimulant.<br/><br/>-It appears that the director is afraid that if something visually interesting is not occurring in EVERY SINGLE SECOND of the movie, we will lose interest.<br/><br/>-The movie is chocked full of corny college humor and slapstick. Also, Kirk is clearly meant to be some sort of space gigolo (He gets with a green alien babe). Scotty is not funny, and always has something stupid to say when the action stops for more than 3/4 of a second.<br/><br/>-The story doesn't make any sense (at least to me). ""A star went supernova"" and threatened to destroy the galaxy. Spock promises to save the planet Romulus, but doesn't get there in time. The bad guy, Nero, blames Spock for the destruction of his home planet, etc. black hole, time travel, etc. So Nero wants to destroy earth and Spock's home planet, and every other planet. What? IT's even more silly and improbable than I make it sound.<br/><br/>-However, the visuals are pretty damn cool. Other than that..."
"gcronau","1","33","53","14 August 2009"," J.J. Abrams Completely missed the point.
","I've thought about this movie a lot since I saw it. Not sure exactly what I wanted to say about it. I can't really go into all that I find wrong with it, there are just too many things. It would take far too long to write about.<br/><br/>But I think the fundamental problem is that J.J. Abrams never fully understood what Star Trek was about. It's not about epic battles and wars and clever characters. At it's core, it was always about the voyage of discovery. An optimistic view of the future. A view that problems can be solved with the mind, not brute force. It was about hope and discovery and life. Not destruction and death.<br/><br/>In some magazine I read a quote from Abrams that really stuck in my mind. He said: ""I was never a fan of Star Trek. I always liked Star Wars. But after making this movie, I'm now a big fan! I can't wait to see what happens to these characters next!"" (That's the closest I can remember his quote.)<br/><br/>I can't help but feel I'm hearing someone say: ""I never liked the taste of white wine, I was never a fan, but one day I poured out the bottle and filled it with Pepsi and now white wine tastes great. I'm a fan!""<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams has poured the essence out of Star Trek and filled it with absurd, contrived, poorly thought out fluff.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing more than Michael Bay nonsense dressed up in Star Trek drag. It has only the surface trappings of Trek without the heart."

","***First let me say this review contains big whopping spoilers***<br/><br/>I've barely ever given an opinion on films (or anything else for that matter) but this film bothered me so much I felt compelled to.<br/><br/>I have always been a big fan of the franchise and throughout the build up to the release of this movie effort I had a snaking suspicion that this film would not be as good as it's predecessors but after seeing the ratings and some of the other reviews I was very mistakenly optimistic about it.<br/><br/>The Good Direction - 9/10 action packed and great tension levels. VFX - 10/10 best effects I've ever seen in a film Acting 9/10 Great job by all except Wynonna Ryder whose acting didn't invest me in her character to care when it was killed off. Casting - 9/10 Good fits for the roles with the exception of Uhura who has a very strong American accent , the original idea behind the character was that she was from the USA - united states of Africa which would be equally as powerful as anywhere else in the world, a more African actress would have been more suitable and not a Disney African.<br/><br/>The Bad (spoilers here) Plot - 2/10 A 1-dimensional villain wants tit for tat revenge by destroying the united federation of planets because Spock probably destroyed Romulus? Why do they keep using this type of plot when the best plots are the ones that challenge the audience into new ways of thinking? i.e The City on the Edge of Forever, Mirror, Mirror, Amok Time and The Devil in the Dark. I don't think the star trek formula was broken until they started overusing the space battle formula.<br/><br/>I thought the comedy in the film was too abundant and weak; apart from the kobayashi maru scene nothing was all that funny. Although comedy is a part of star trek it was usually witty dialog and usually is used in moderation to balance the seriousness. Not in this case it ruined the pacing of the film. By the time Scotty who was typically the comic relief character arrives on screen it was like pouring more milk into some already very milky tea. And why did Scotty have a jar-jar binx type monkey sidekick? The ignorant audience members next to me thought the incomprehensible meeps and beeps amusing but I didn't see the point of it here.<br/><br/>The scriptwriter thought they had license to do whatever they want with the star trek universe. Huge plot changes with very little payoff and I think it is going to be needlessly hard for anyone to write a follow up. If they wanted to kick start this franchise all they managed to do was kick it while it was down. I can understand getting a new more casual audience into the fandom with a simple plot but this plot is way too dumbed down and isolates the hard core fan too much. I was not used to seeing Leonard Nimoy in such a bad plot. My main plot gripes. - How does a crazy miner get the resources to mount such an unstoppable attack on starfleet? - The implausible odds of Kirk and old Spcok both being marooned in the same very random ice cave together - Why does the villain need and elaborate black hole drill to destroy a planet when everyone knows a starship can do the same job with one shot in mere seconds? - A cadet can't suddenly become a captain, it takes thousands of hours of experience before you can do anything in life. - Mocking Chekov for his inability for not being able to pronounce his V's repeatedly in the space of 2 minutes is just plain racist - Everyone suddenly wants into Uhuras knickers. - McCoy who always flew by shuttle as he feared the matter transporter now hates shuttle craft, - It should not have taken less than a minute to make spock fly off the handle - Capt. Pike has no plot development and it is not determined why he had the eel put in him or what the payoff was - McCoy and Spock being in strong agreement, generally they are polar opposites where Spock is logic, mc coy is emotion and Kirk is the middle ground.<br/><br/>Music - 2/10 not even close to the Alexander courage theme, and not epic enough a theme to convey the scale of the enterprise and its mission Also Sabotage by the Beastie Boys was completely out of place in its scene and a film set in the 23rd century. Props and Sets - 2/10 Although nice and shiny there ship lacks functionality, I didn't like the big dome in the middle of the transporter for no reason, the new phasers, the ship to ship communication with the wrong viewing aspect ratio, and voice recognition was a far fetched novelty that was used in a show at the end of star treks run, There was also 21st century product placement for Budweiser and Nokia? wtf?<br/><br/>I guess the needs of the money outweigh the needs of the few"

"mistabobdobolina","5","6","7","23 April 2012"," Star Trek
","When this movie first came out, and I saw it in theatres, I felt like I was living in Bizarro World. When I came out of the theatre, I felt like I had just watched a loud, brainless, barely-plotted SF equivalent to a Fast and Furious or Charlie's Angels movie. But apparently, nine of ten people around me had just seen a timeless, golden classic of SF cinema that had brilliantly restored their faith in Star Trek, film, humanity and indeed the existence of all life.<br/><br/>This discontinuity has troubled me ever since; while there's no accounting for taste, it's rare for my taste in movies to clash this badly with those of almost every film critic and film fanatic in existence. I'm no Trekkie (nor a Trekker for that matter), I don't go to conventions or speak Klingon or reckon my birthday by Stardates or decorate my home with show memorabilia, but a disturbing possibility began to occur to me: had I nevertheless become enough of a Trek geek to be obsessed with fidelity to the original to the point where I was overreacting to Abrams' ""reboot""? I decided I should give it some time and try watching it again, later and after the hype had died down, with an open mind.<br/><br/>Well, I've done that. And it still sucks the sweat off a dead Klingon's balls, and I'm more convinced than ever that this will be film history's more sober assessment of it as the movie's initial shock-wave of hypotronic particles gradually decays. But I also, I think, have a better understanding of how the hype and praise got to be so overheated in the first place.<br/><br/>First, it has to be said that despite being handed an absolute dog of a script full of cringe-inducing attempts to allude to the original show (""All I've got left is my *bones*,"" get it? get it?) the cast they assembled was for the most part strong and talented and acted the heck out of what they had to work with. Okay, Anton Yelchin's Chekov is painful for every second he's on screen and Simon Pegg mostly seems to play Simon Pegg (though he rips into his first Assigned Scotty Cliché, ""I'm given' 'er all she's got, Cap'n!"" with the verve of a true fan boy), but the rest of the cast do bring their A-game, and such entertainment as the film offers comes chiefly from watching Karl Urban sink his teeth into the grand old Kelley-isms, or Chris Pine replicate the signature Shatnerian swagger, or Zach Quinto doing the eyebrow thing. It's a purely nostalgic pleasure and I'm not sure how you build on it, but it's there.<br/><br/>Second, fans had watched Star Trek painting dully inside the lines of its established style for so long that it must have seemed like a revelation to see a Star Trek movie that *actually tried to be thrilling*. The space-jumping scene, complete with the instant death of its assigned red-shirt and Sulu's ridiculous-but-fun sword battle with a Romulan pirate, is genuinely pretty good action cinema. And while watching Chris Pine hang from the edges of things gets old, they at least try to keep up that kind of momentum for the rest of the film. The cinematography (despite the annoying preponderance of lens flares) is calculated to be awe-inspiring in ways that the prior Trek movie franchise seemed to have forgotten about. Sure, it *is* really only at the visual level of a well-funded but brainless SF actioner, but that at least was a departure from a film franchise that had simply stopped trying.<br/><br/>Third, there was the germ, somewhere in the script, of a praiseworthy attempt to up the stakes and tell a truly grand story. The full emotional weight of this is mostly lost in the frenetic action, and the destruction of Vulcan is an almost absurdly tossed-off event, but it still lends some heft to Quinto's performance -- and to the poignancy of his romance with Uhura, one of the film's best character beats.<br/><br/>That's the good.<br/><br/>The bad? Really the most fundamental problem is that nothing -- *nothing* -- about the story makes any sense. At all. The time-travel story line has all the usual weaknesses (like, why wouldn't Nero just warn Romulus instead of going on a mad quest to off all the Federation planets?) plus more besides (what exactly do Nero and his crew spend twenty-five years doing while they're waiting for Spock?). Nothing about how Starfleet behaves makes any sense, and even by the pulpiest of science fantasy and Treknobabble standards, the story's premise doesn't make a lick of sense either. The script is riddled with coincidences and fudges -- and one especially glaring deus ex machina, ""transwarp beaming"" -- that are probably meant to imply Destiny asserting its power or some such thing, but that simply smack of really bad writing (including the Muppet Babies Syndrome that requires absolutely every member of the original cast to be present and accounted for by movie's end, with Kirk near-magically promoted to captain *from cadet*). The story isn't just bad. It's really just barely there at all.<br/><br/>This is a big problem, since without a halfway-believable story underpinning it -- as many a brainless actioner has proved -- action becomes relatively meaningless. The final set-piece is neck-deep in writer fudges by the time it happens, with Nero's dying snarls practically coming off as comedy and Scotty's second Assigned Cliché Moment (the Last-Minute Miracle Fix) having preordained a safe escape for the heroes. What little suspense the action had managed to build is long gone."

","I gave this movie a 5/10 because if you go into this movie having never  been exposed to Star Trek before it is a fairly entertaining action  flick.  For the Trekkie, however, it was absolutely horrible. I suppose that I  might fit in with the ""hardcore trekkie"" crowd who is very hard to  please, but I've never been to a convention, I didn't care much for TOS  or Enterprise. I can't quote every single episode. I was a pretty big  fan of TNG and DS9 and I've seen all of the movies.  Anyway ... the movie involves time travel. I figured by now anyone to  ever touch Star Trek would have it figured out that time travel is the  Trekkie's nemesis. If your plot requires time travel, the movie (or TV  episode) will suck. That's pretty much a rule just like the even/odd  movie rule (while Nemesis broke that rule, this movie puts it back on  track).  Eric Bana plays the villain, Nero, who was superfluous and totally  unoriginal. He's a Romulan (btw - for no reason what-so-ever they  decided to change the appearance of Romulans. They're now bald and have  paint on their faces) that survived the destruction of Romulus when  their star went nova, killing his wife along with most Rolumans. Spock  was supposed to save the planet but failed. Nero blames Spock and  decides to take vengeance by traveling back in time to destroy Vulcan  and earth.  The plot reminded me of the two-part Voyager episode ""Year of Hell""  starring Kurtwood Smith. I'm pretty sure that episode involved time  travel, and the basic premise (wife gets killed, guy goes bad and  starts destroying planets) is almost exactly the same! So the plot is  lame and ripped off from other cheesy Star Trek plots from past  episodes. But there's other extremely lame elements as well:   o Spotty has a cheesy, annoying and unnecessary side-kick that reminds  me of Jar Jar Binks (though he doesn't speak as much so it's not quite  as bad).  o Spock and Uhura have a love affair.  o At the end of the movie they leave the ""star trek universe"" in such a  manner that destroys all future Star Trek events. Basically TNG, DS9,  Voyager, Enterprise ... never happen. I suppose this might not matter  if you accept the time travel premise and ""alternate time-lines"" etc.  but that's basically an excuse to ignore canon and do whatever the hell  you want. In other words if you go down that path you're deciding from  the beginning that you're going to write a bad script.  o There's a freakin' sword fighting scene!!!! Why don't they just pull  out a phaser and shoot the bad guy!?!?   o As someone else said, Kirk was unlikeable as a character. He was made  out to be completely infallible and didn't care about anything. He was  that ""sexy rebel without a cause, that finds his cause"" Hollywood  cliché.   Overall this movie was a ""Big Hollywood Blockbuster Action Flick"" and  not a Star Trek movie. I gave it a 5 because if that's what you're  looking for, it doesn't fail. The story is lame but unimportant if what  you want is lots of explosions and unnecessary, drawn-out fight scenes.  In terms of acting, dialogue and the script this movie could be one of  those ""so bad it's good in a funny kind of way"" films."

","Like most human beings on the planet, I've seen most Star Trek offerings in one adaptation or another, and there's nowhere you can go to escape its pervasive influence - as Shatner discovered once in India. I grew up seeing the first airing on UK TV of TOS and was utterly mesmerised and awe-inspired. The effects were crap, the starships unconvincing, the camera-rolls (as the ship shook) comical, the studio-sets glaringly obvious, made-for-TV-style evident, but... you know, the stories were powerul and full-bodied and a lot of thought were put into them.<br/><br/>This movie is the reverse. Great effects, astonishing setpieces, convincing starship interiors, sweeping panoramas... but the storyline really sucks big time. The individual actors performed excellently, and they delivered their characters with dedication and reverence to the franchise, but come on... really? Would Kirk actually usurp the acting captain by out-arguing him? Would Spock ""lose it"" rather than just call security and have Kirk put in the brig? He never ""lost it"" in TOS unless a biological or chemical agent or mind-control was involved (where we'd see others from his perspective through a fish-eye lens). Would Kirk really ""by chance"" meet alternative-timeline Spock and be transported back to the Enterprise? And if Spock disposed of Kirk so coolly the first time, using his Vulcan nerve-pinch while Kirk struggles with security, why couldn't he just do the same again? Would the ""old"" Spock meet the ""young"" Spock and tell him ""Good luck"" (how lame is that?) in a post-modern stylie? Neither is there a convincing villain of substance or merit that glues the story together and it employs that hackneyed trick that all modern directors use when they want to justifiably alter a back-story: a black-hole. And Nero? Doesn't he and his minions have the same homogenised look and feel of all the other Next Generation villains? Where the hell were the Klingons? The Romulans?! They hardly appeared in TOS. And if the Vulcans lost their homeworld, then where did Spock go to get resurrected in The Search For Spock? <br/><br/>I know it could be argued that it advances the franchise's progress. Or even that it's a unique movie in its own right and should be accepted on its own merits. If that's the case, then why all the trailers and hype and buildup on sight and sound references to TOS icons? Why not just hype it up as an independent, new-concept, re-interpretation movie? Because the producers, directors and distributors know it would've tanked and needed to spend 7 years in the DVD/foreign markets to recover its losses. That's why. Look at how the incredible hulk concept suffered because of Ang Lee's Hulk, and just how long it took before the distributors/studios were willing to develop the far superior and more reverent Hulk 2.<br/><br/>This movie is unfulfilling tripe. It contains storyline elements that undermine all the TV shows and movies. The plot is shallow as a puddle. Eye-candy. Pure eye-candy. That's all it is. <br/><br/>The directors will have to work really hard and make a lot of amends if they want my respect for the alleged sequel said to be scheduled for Summer 2011."

","Combining a lame villain, a thin story with plot holes larger than the Delta Quadrant, a totally irrelevant love interest between 2 main characters and spicing it up with the characters of the original series, was not the right recipe to reboot the Star Trek franchise...<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, the one thing missing was an old Kirk (played by William Shatner) waking up and realizing this was all a dream. And I'm sure that would make more sense, than the movie itself ...<br/><br/>I have to admit though that taking everything into account the actors did quite a good job on this unbelievable story. Especially 'Bones' surprised me and convinced me immediately as the young Dr. McCoy. Kirk and Spock did OK, but Uhura and Scotty were less convincing ...<br/><br/>So before cashing in on the success of this movie, I hope they'll find some decent story writers because Star Trek deserves better than this."

"colossus24","5","17","25","9 June 2009"," Frantic, sometimes entertaining, quite dumb
","It's already been a few weeks since I saw this movie, which is kind of a bummer when it comes to writing a review because the nature of this flick is one of rapid, almost continuous action sequences, hurled at the viewer with warp speed. Coupled with few, if any, scenes of emotional significance, it creates a sense of having looked into a kaleidoscope for a few minutes and attempting to recall specific patterns. The retained memory is that of a jumble of pretty colors, but little describable coherence.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie five stars for its pure entertainment value generated by some decent attempts at humor and some inventive action sequences. To be honest, I would rate this movie a star or two lower if I haven't been desensitized by the truly awful blockbuster movies released in the past few years (Matrix 2/3, Dark Knight, Terminator 4, Transformers). Way to keep lowering the bar, Hollywood.<br/><br/>Now, let's get on with the nitpicks, shall we? I think I will use the good old bullet-point technique for this one as I just feel to lazy to write transitional paragraphs.<br/><br/><ul><li>The time travel plot - Time travel usually amounts to asking for trouble because of the innumerable paradoxes involved and it's typically a sign that the writers just didn't have a good idea for how to setup the action. In this case, it's almost certain that they were looking for a way to plug Leonard Nimoy (and possibly Shatner as well) into the movie to tap into the rapturous fan boy sentiments. It was a bad idea and the plot is weak. Besides, time travel has been used on numerous occasions in Star Trek movie/series' so it feels very derivative.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The weak villains - They look fine, all thuggish and ruthless, and their ship is actually really cool (there's a funny scene when Kirk and Spock are beamed onto the villain ship), but the plot fails to provide a decent justification for their desire to create carnage. OK, their planet was destroyed and it sucks, but it was destroyed by a natural phenomenon. Spock honestly tried to save that planet and failed simply because it was already too late. It's not like he caused the explosion through some careless experiments in his science lab. Therefore, it's a stretch for Nero and his crew to harbor such strong sentiments against Spock and chase him through space and time to finally blow up his home planet. One could argue that villains aren't always the most reasonable of folk and one would be technically correct, but that's just a cop out. Movie plots require well-defined motivations for character behavior, otherwise the creators can argue away any script weakness saying: uhmmm, yeah, we actually meant for it to be vague and nonsensical.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dweebish, irresponsible Kirk's stratospheric career rise - I don't think this needs a particularly detailed explanation how dumb it is for an inexperienced cadet, who made his way onto a military ship as a stowaway and should have been summarily court-martialed or executed on the spot, to become a captain of said ship within the span of one day. Honestly, the only justification of that should have been if the entire crew suddenly died out from space-fever and the ship computer, certainly more qualified than Kirk, suffered a Hal9000-like cyber-dementia. What bothers me is the type of precedent set for the viewers, that you don't need to put in honest hard work to become successful. You can just flaunt the rules, act unreasonably cocky, because somehow you are better than everyone else, and then just hang around to reap the immediate rewards. Yeah, that's just the kind of example that people need to see, especially in the crumbling US.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Impossible action sequences - I basically repeat it as a mantra after watching every action flick since the original Matrix. Virtually all film makers have given up on trying to create realistic and immersive action in lieu of the most ridiculous stunts the mind can conjure. I find it notoriously exasperating that the art of creating fantastic. but internally cohesive and plausible action seems to be lost. There are some examples of that in ST as well, such as the very first scene where kid Kirk jumps out of a car and hangs on by his fingertips over a deep chasm. I mean, really?!? What's that supposed to illustrate exactly, other than trying to draw in the most easily impressed and gullible audience out there? Similarly when Sulu and Kirk fight the two guys on the drilling platform. First of all their dive out of the sky was ludicrous, but it was somewhat interesting so that can slide. But it gets downright lame, when exactly two bad guys emerge from the platform, conveniently wielding melee combat weapons (now that wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that Sulu stated a couple of minutes earlier that he's a fencing expert now would it? I thought not).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Uhura (sp?) - What a strange character. I still haven't figured out what was the point of introducing her. Sure she was decent enough eye candy, but the movie bounced between trying to portray her as ambitious and competent, and an emotional manipulator. Her attempts to seduce Spock were rather immoral given the fact that he was her commanding officer and she was just fresh on the job. Also, using sex appeal to get onboard the Enterprise in the first place was rather low class. Once again, the main issue here is the kind of example that is being set for the viewers, mostly female in this case. </li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, the movie was somewhat entertaining, but it continues the trend of rather awful Blockbusters who continue to rack in the cash on the strength of rehashing old, once great franchises, and aggressive, in-your-face advertising campaigns."

","Hello All<br/><br/>I am an avid Trek fan and I'm wondering if I saw the same film as the majority of you out there.<br/><br/>It was ruined by the so-called 'star' of the film; Chris Pine, who seems to do nothing else but fight, look sulky and generally behave like a spoilt 10-year old. It was pathetic and could have been easily put right by a director who seems to have been more interested in the CGI than the actual character of the lead role. Kirk here was someone you'd love to hate and after half an hour I kept hoping he was going to be killed at the earliest opportunity. In contrast, the character of young Spock was played very well by Zachary Quinto who really stole the film; his depiction of a Vulcan 'on the edge' was great and in keeping with Trek tradition. <br/><br/>A big disappointment too, though, was the introduction of ALL the other main characters from the original TV series (McCoy, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu and Scotty) all in the same film. They were only ever introduced over a long period of time in the series and so this is just wrong! <br/><br/>And the general story line: too complex with the villain reminding me of Star Trek: Nemesis.<br/><br/>Final positive comment is that the special effects were amazing."

Kirk (Chris Pine) was the worst of the cast. I could find a better performance of Kirk on Youtube then they had for this movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet don't waste your money. I would give it a lower rating but the scale doesn't have negative numbers."
"albertomarabini","3","31","50","11 May 2009"," A wannabe serious version of Starship Troopers?
","At least Starship Troopers was self-ironical. <br/><br/>Pros: 1)Spock is awesome...beside a big huge glitch in the script:I think he can add a lot to the original character staying perfectly inside the tradition. 2) Uhura and Spock sexual tension: yummy! Though it needs a lot of maturity in it. 3) Sulu with ninja swords! Yay! 4) Scott: awesome pick , amazing actor! Again the guy can add a lot to the original character But the script should do a better effort to make him look lesser silly (like in old roles he played) and scientifically sound. 5) Visual: stunning (see Vulcan!), even though starship interiors looks too much industrial basements. Where are star Trek corridors?! Vulcan schools? Amazingly Matrix like! 6) Bones is definitely the young Bones. <br/><br/>Cons (oh my...): 1) Star Trek is the Batman of sci fi. I expect ""Dark Knight"", not a popcorn movie from it. 2) Kirk. I don't know the actor so i can't judge if he was picked because his looks or his acting. Kirk doing stupid stuff with cars at 10? Good! But here was deprived of the main character characteristic: Kirk's charisma. The charisma of this guy is: i'm the dude, whatever i do is awesome, i'm awesome and anybody follows me because i am awesome and i'll never fail because.. i'm the most awesomely awesome guy in the universe. That's Paris Hilton. Kirk is a giant, a man driven by a deep humility, willingness and curiosity of discover, respect for the fleet, it's role in the universe, and for other civilizations, but at the same time capable to understand when to break rules in a smart/responsible/thoughtful way and when to think and act out of the box...also in a very manly way. And capable to take decisions being conscious of the possibility of making mistakes that may cost the life of hundreds of people and have to bear that responsibility forever. This guy doesn't show a glitch of that inner tension. Spock was emotionally challenged in that moment?! Naaa! Kirk was...and succeed passing trough it...and maybe paying something to reality and trough that moment discover the real burden of command! That was a great Star Trek story to tell. How Kirk became Kirk! This guy is almost a bully (the caricature of manliness/charisma/leadership), that from nothing in 3 years becomes captain of a starship (when usually a cadet to become first official takes at least 10) No special achievement before (just country boy on beers and cars)...and the test thing...i really hoped he handled it by grasping a higher imperfection in the test philosophy...not just barely cheating...and in that bully way...i waited 30 years to see what happened...jeez... I hope Marines do not teach this to their commanding people! Here we are propagating a ""Dick Chaney"" prospective of what leading is. I would have preferred something more Obama. I know...next movie the guy will have a problem with his attitude, lead him into alcohol and getting out from that because his sense of responsibility for the fleet and blablabla. Can't we write an original script any once in a while?! <br/><br/>Original star Trek helped me to grow up. Here...we are just keeping the kids in their mud. Because thinking that being bully is leadership is just that. Media should stop simplifying this matter or next generations will keep voting burly guys that order wars just because is cool.<br/><br/>3)This federation is a joke. I mean...they allow a cadet that just did such insubordinations to get into command of their main piece? Not only the main command...but even the cadets on the bridge?! That then promotes him officially with that stupid ceremony where everybody smiles and chuckles? This is tickling bully narcissistic behaviors! And Star Trek is the opposite. Is a space tale about the need for the humanity to grow up, using the paradigm of the space deepness to investigate the deepness of the human spirit. Is inspired by Shakespeare not Baywatch. I know was a difficult story to tell...but this is too much of a simplification. Corporate Studios look just for the easy money? Apparently! Produce, consume and die. Star trek instead helped set higher grounds for all. Will this new franchise? 4)Spock giving up the command. Ha! Spock would have just kicked out the guy from the bridge. And on what base Kirk then became the commander?! Just because he's awesome? If i was there i would have shoot him with my phaser! 5) Too much bold jokes. Again...popcorn. 6) Too much fun on Chekov. I'm pretty sure that the original used to bath in Siberia's iced waters when young. This guy is supercool though let's have him do some gym and act more alpha for the next episode. 7) Next time you do a green skinned girl make sure she has antennas on his head. (what was that anonymous Star Wars alien on the bridge?!) 8)Another important question: originally ST had this design to promote peace and deep understanding among people of the world and people of the space. For once let's see how for real a Scottish and a Russian can interact with an American crew and spit blood as brothers in arms and not play just their stupid national cameos. <br/><br/>With this said, I think the movie may be the key to open the continuity to newer generations. And that is a good thing. I hope that it may work as in Harry Potter: start from honey and get into the dark/mature side of reality. Star Trek is a journey into the human being using the space as a paradigm as the magic is in Potter. I would recommend the actor that plays Kirk to moneyless backpack trough Asia and Europe the whole next year to prepare for the next episodes. Hope not to see him on some girlie magazine together with Paris Hilton because they are both so aaaawesome."
"rankit1982","4","26","41","15 May 2009"," Are you serious?
","This movie was totally amazing. Well, maybe if you've never seen Star Trek before. The creators of this movie obviously know nothing at all about Star Trek. For one, the Federation knew nothing about Romulans until Kirk and the Enterprise discovered them. Two, Romulus was one of the galaxy's main suppliers of Dy lithium crystals. Without the planet to supply these crystals, how would all the future ships power themselves? I do not understand. Three, both Vulcan and Romulus had numerous settlements all around the galaxy. If their main planet was destroyed, they would still have hundreds of people left in the galaxy. Four, the existence of Future Spock would ruin the whole time line. By him living in the past as his future self, he has knowledge that could severely change the future. Example: he gave Scotty the transporter formula that wouldn't be developed for quite some time later. By doing this he altered the development of the transporter. Who knows what other things that action could affect. Any person he comes in contact with will be altered in some way or another. Each person altered will alter everyone else they encounter, causing a chain effect of alterations. The future we know it would be completely different than how we currently know it. There are plenty of other things I could say about the movie's mistakes, but I will leave it at that. The special effects are amazing, and the acting is great, but the whole essence of Star Trek is ruined forever. Hollywood only cares about making money; nothing else. The creators of this movie were both lazy and disrespectful. They ruined Star Trek just like Star Wars was ruined."

","I wanted to like this movie, but there was just so much wrong with it, that any attempt to suspend my disbelief would be futile.<br/><br/>Here's what I felt worked well in the movie:<br/><br/>The comedic elements (which was shocking because the comedy that these writers put in Transformers was completely awful). Especially funny was the origin of McCoy's nickname. And even though the multiple injections he gave Kirk was silly, it was still funny and elicited genuine laughs.<br/><br/>The Enterprise looked beautiful, and in fact almost every set looked fantastic. <br/><br/>The cast did a good job playing their parts, more or less. Especially good were Pine as Kirk, Urban as McCoy, Saldana as Uhura, Pegg as Scotty, Greenwood as Pike, Nimoy as Spock, Cross as Sarek and Tahir as Robau.<br/><br/>They kept the Academy scene brief; not turning it into Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>Here's what I felt didn't work so well:<br/><br/>Quinto as Spock just didn't capture the character very well. Maybe he just isn't the best actor, but I felt like he was unable to convey what Nimoy could do just with his eyes. It would be hard to top Nimoy because he was always the best actor on TOS, but I felt that Quinto fell quite a bit short.<br/><br/>I really like John Cho but they really didn't have to cast a Korean guy to be Japanese; are there really no good Japanese actors out there that weren't dying to play the part of Sulu?<br/><br/>Bana as Nero was nothing special. Shinzon in Nemesis did a much better job of playing a furious Romulan than this guy, and that movie was pretty bad.<br/><br/>Yelchin as Chekov was nothing special, either, though I disagree with a lot of others who that he was a completely wrong choice.<br/><br/>All of the action sequences, although they looked very nice, moved too quickly to follow. Too many fast cuts and bright flashes to truly get a sense what was happening. Reminded me a lot of the action in Transformers.<br/><br/>The musical score was not nearly as good as other reviewers have stated. It felt very out-of-place on numerous occasions (I did like the scene with Sabotage, however).<br/><br/>And now what was just awful:<br/><br/>Pike promoting Kirk to 1st Officer was just stupid and never should have happened. <br/><br/>We as an audience being given no emotional attachment to the planet Vulcan before it was destroyed made it considerably less weighty. We were meant to feel more for Kirk's father dying than for the death of an entire planet of beloved Vulcans. <br/><br/>Spock subsequently ejecting his new 1st officer from the ship was another lazy plot device. The ensuing scene on the ice planet with the animal chase scene was pathetically reminiscent of Star Wars, which led to the very random encounter with Spock Prime.<br/><br/>Ummm, how does a black hole send two ships through time? Every molecule in each ship should have shattered and been compressed to near- nothingness. Nimoy explaining that event made me say, ""Wow, Leonard Nimoy just sold out!""<br/><br/>The scene where Scotty is trapped in the water tubes was just silly.<br/><br/>And the ending where they dump and detonate the warp core to escape was lame. The old Trek would have come up with something intelligent, instead of making a huge, pretty explosion to save the day.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have little faith in the future of this franchise as long as the same writers and director are involved. There was definite potential here which was squandered with lazy storytelling and lazy directing. The look was certainly fantastic, as were some of the acting performances, but it was not enough to offset the numerous failures. It is possible that the sequel could be better, but I fear they will follow the same dumbed down and mass appealing direction that so many movies have moved to nowadays. Action movies can work very well when there is heart and good storytelling behind it, and unfortunately, this had little of either.<br/><br/>4/10 (Edited from a 5 after further reflection)<br/><br/>As a reference, I love TOS and the first few movies, thought TNG and Voyager were mediocre except for a few good stories here and there and a few good actors, never saw DS9 or Enterprise, and I never went to conventions or anything, just always liked the positive spirit of the show."

","This was a joke. The story was bad - even nonsensical. Since it involved time travel (and nearly anything is possible in that scenario) it was especially bad. The plot contrivances were laughable. The ""logic"" flow that puts Kirk in command of the Enterprise was super silly. Dr. McCoy had no real purpose in the movie. By the time Mr. Scott was introduced I had forgotten he was even in the script. The guy playing Spock probably did the best job, especially with the crap script he was working with. However, Spock getting it on with Uhura in the elevator was ridiculous, and just so foreign to the original character. The ""special effects"" were childish when they were not down right stupid. The hand phasers looked like they were shooting rubber-headed suction darts. And what was with the ""recoil""? I half expected to hear someone say ""bang""! Why was the ""laser"" drilling rig suspended on a giant electrical extension cord? LOL! The craft that Spock piloted looked like something out of Tom Terrific. Why did the Enterprise have water-powered turbines? Wasn't this like 300+ years in the future? If someone had opened the steam engine door and thrown in a shovelful of coal it would have seemed perfectly reasonable. It was almost like a spoof of Galaxy Quest. Didn't anyone on the set actually watch the original series? The photon torpedoes were about as effective as bottle rockets. The ship's phasers couldn't melt a frozen popsicle. I don't think the shields protected the ship from anything. The Romulan ship was even worse. What was with all the gangways to nowhere, with no railings and sheer falls of several stories? And wasn't this ship a complete ripoff of the vessel in Star Trek: Nemesis? The whole Kirk-is-born-20-seconds-before-his-father-dies-as-a-hero is just SOOOOO lame. Apparently, even in 2300 A.D. they still like the sex of the child to be a surprise. This whole thing stunk. J.J.Abrams should be run out of town on a rail.

At least, that's what they said on the Commentary section of the DVD, if I remember correctly.<br/><br/>Communications Department: OK, we have a really, really, really important mission with our finest new ship. We have no time for orientation or anything like that because this could literally be a life and death mission for all and there's no time to spare. Plus, we've got a whole lot of cadets on this new ship, so it is IMPERATIVE that we get Starfleet's urgent message to everyone on the Enterprise as clearly and succinctly as possible so everyone knows what we're up against and to act accordingly. OK, who do we employ to deliver this super duper important brief to the entire crew???? What? You mean there's a navigator on board that cannot even pronounce letters that our 23rd century computer can recognize as he recites his password? What? He's 17 yrs. old? Yeah! He's our man! Broadcast it!<br/><br/>Finally, I will admit the movie is fun--I've watched it several times. But, if you're a thinking man/woman and don't like glaring plot holes: best to get a 3-4 inch roofing nail, stick it in your ear, put said ear and head firmly on well-traveled train track, and wait. Then watch!"

","As someone with a longstanding fondness for most things Trek (I've seen most of the movies and quite a few of the shows), I have to say that JJ & Co did a fine job with this picture; the character dynamics were broadly satisfying, the action scenes entertaining and the set pieces well put together. Most of all I was impressed with the lightness of touch of the whole venture - it would be very easy to criticise the picture for making what could be considered significant changes to certain parts of Trek lore, but given that the changes were accomplished with such comfort and confidence makes them, in my view, perfectly acceptable.<br/><br/>With regards to the acting characterisation, everyone was pretty much solid, with perhaps the exception of Sulu, who I thought didn't have much to do. Kudos, though, to Zoe Saldana's loveliness as Uhura and also, especially, to Chris Pine as Kirk - I had always thought Spock was my favourite character, but it looks like I may have to reassess; Pine lives and breathes that Kirk moxie exquisitely and he'll be great fun to watch in future instalments.<br/><br/>With regards to plot, it's pretty good; there is a decent sense of internal logic to it, without it being too overwrought. True, there are a number of points where you might think, ""Blimey, that's serendipitous,"" but as I'd already suspended my disbelief to accept the possibility of time travelling green-blooded alien from the planet Vulcan, these things really didn't bother me at all. Plus there were a number of points in the movie where they were saying, ""We were pulling this kind of shtick 20+ years ago, and you loved it then; run with us on this one,"" and I was happy to.<br/><br/>Oh, and most importantly of all, the movie is fun; it has the good sense to not take itself too seriously, despite remaining well aware of that sense of pomp and importance that all great character dramas should have, and that isn't a bad thing at all.<br/><br/>How this movie will bear up to repeat viewings, I'm not certain yet, but at the premiere, it was a blast.<br/><br/>Addendum: It's a month plus since I originally wrote this and I have seen the film three times in total now - the opening ten minutes remain a manipulative marvel that the remainder of the film struggles to match, the coincidences and conveniences seem even more far fetched than ever and the jokes seem even more silly BUT I still fancy seeing it again, so I guess it must work for me."

","I just saw this movie the other day, and I was very exited to see this new Star Trek because the last one was very disappointing in my opinion.<br/><br/>I was shocked to learn that this movie was almost the SAME as Nememis! Same weak plot, and very non-Star Trek look and feel. The story of this movie lacked almost everything that makes Star Trek what it is ( or was). <br/><br/>Again some Romulan seeks revenge for his home-planet being destroyed in the future. Okay, in Nemesis it was not the Romulans themselves but one Reman, that used the Romulans. But hey, still one guy with a grudge that is going to get even by destroying the whole galaxy! Because he has a weapon far more powerful and advanced than any other weapon in the galaxy! This does not only remind me of Nemesis, it also reminds me of the Xindi plot from Star Trek: Enterprise. Come on, is that what you story-writers can come up with? Nemesis/Enterprise re-written?<br/><br/>Besides the 'enemy' being the same old sh*t, there is something else that bothers me. This is another 'time-traveling' movie. Why do they travel in time so much in Star Trek? In the series they used to do it once in a while, but time-traveling has become standard operation these days. Again Spock travels back in time, Again the enterprise has dealings with enemies from the future. What irritates me also is the fact that they 'abuse' this time-traveling just to introduce some technology that wasn't available in the 'normal' time-line.<br/><br/>Last comment I have is the sound. The movie was very loud, in an annoying way. I liked the scenes when there were conversations, just because those scenes were not so damn loud and busy. You don't have a clear view as a viewer on whats happening. <br/><br/>Good thing about this film is the cast and the acting. The roles of Kirk, Spock and the rest are portrayed very well, and that is one big plus. Bad thing is that the total 'Trekkie' look and feel is gone. Star Trek was always bashed upon by a great many people because they simply did not understand it. It was based on science they did not comprehend, nor understand. If you watched Star Trek, you were Nerd. But for all the Nerds, that made Star Trek cool. Nowadays you can be retarded and still understand this movie, and that is not a compliment."
"dcw-12","1","27","43","21 June 2009"," Confirms all my worst fears about the movie industry and its 'target' market
","I'm not a major Trekkie but I do appreciate most of the movies and do understand why it is such a beloved series. Its loved for subtlety, for intelligence, for the humanity and heroism of the characters, and lastly for the love of fantastical places and events. <br/><br/>In this film humanity is replaced with hammy mockery. Intelligence is replaced with 'splosions. Subtley is replaced with grossness and violence just for the sake of it. There's sexism, stupidity, crassness, all things I don't associate with Star Trek. <br/><br/>Sure there was humor in the Star Trek universe, even innuendo. But it was presented in a normal human way not in a crass or ugly way. <br/><br/>Putting the Star Trek history aside and just viewing this film alone. I will say that I wasn't impressed with the plot. An entire planet blown up and it had less emotional impact than I feel when squashing a cockroach.<br/><br/>The red matter thing was stupid as well as the time traveling thing. As others have said why use time travel for vengeance when you could just warn everyone before it happened. I think a giant advanced ship from the future would convince them you're legit. This is basic stuff here. You feel like the plot was placed there under duress to try and appease the fans of the series. Like they really didn't want to be bothered but begrudgingly threw a scientific crumb to those with a brain. <br/><br/>Sure enough whenever the plot drags at all some 'splosions or CGI is injected into the film. Don't worry Bubba thinking ain't a part of the Star Trek universe no more!<br/><br/>As a science fiction film without a history I would say this is above average. I'd rate it a 5. Its got great effects, the acting is hammy and without real humanity or believability. Its a bit like a big fun house. Lots of surface thrills but little true impact and when its over becomes very forgettable. <br/><br/>As a nod to Star Trek fans I rate this film a 1 however. Its a real travesty to see something they love sacrificed on the Hollywood altar. They've had Star Trek stolen from them and given to the crowd that loved Dieharder. <br/><br/>This film parodies Star Trek itself and tears it down at the same time. Now the Star Trek fans who didn't like Star Wars understand how the die hards felt about Episode I. Its not a good feeling all the way around."
"djackson780","1","69","122","10 May 2009"," A travesty.
","I was greatly disappointed with the new Star Trek movie. It was a horrible movie. I found that the The Movie would have better off not been made, rather than have this revisionist crap. I would have rather seen a Trek movie set after previous installments rather than backtracking to previous time periods, which is bound to pollute the continuity of the trek story line. Creating a parallel trek universe as this one did is an equal travesty. I think what really has upset me is that this new movie goes against what Trek was supposed to be, an optimistic and bright view of the future where our problems can be solved. Sure, there were villains in the true Star Trek, But in the end, the good guys were victorious, planets and peoples were saved. A handful of people may have died but not billions. This new Trek is a depressing turn into something that Trek was not meant to be, a dark, pessimistic view of wars and failures, massive killing and deaths of billions of people, rather than a vision of Gene Roddenberry of a generally happy, peaceful, optimistic future. It is completely different than the positive, bright, optimistic view of the future of the the last great trek installments: Original Series, 1980s-early 90s movies, and STNG(R.I.P) . Destroying planets just does not belong in Trek, which is an optimistic and positive view of the future rather than a Star Wars-esquire future of bleak wars and billions being killed. Basically what Abrams has done is create a new series and has thrown out everything Trek was supposed to be, trying to turn it into Star Wars, mainly to exploit the Trek universe to enrich themselves. If they really wanted to create a new series universe, why not just create a new one rather than to pollute Star Trek universe with this crap. Gene Roddenberry is rolling in his grave."

","This film was god-awful. It made no sense, it's full of convenient lies, and you could have moved the whole thing to a train and it would have made no difference since the SCI-FI element was conveniently eked out. I know JJ Abrams is a bit of a tool but he seems to have the power to get big films made. Why then does he waste our time by not writing proper scripts, or explaining things, relying on trite clichés and special effects instead of story telling. I wish i'd injected my balls with food dye so i could come red matter, it would still be more interesting and meaningful than this piece of sphincter wax. SUNSHINE was better than this. Event Horizon Was Better than this. Bloody Robocop was better than this. It's 2009 and nine, i think we have the technology for a good script and good special effects. Maybe by hiring a writer instead of this TV hack."
"keith-moyes","1","24","38","19 May 2009"," The future begins, possibly
","I have never been a particularly avid Star Trek fan, so this was hardly a must-see movie for me. Nonetheless, I was intrigued to see if JJ Abrams could revive the show in the same way that Russell T Davis revived Dr Who a few years ago.<br/><br/>The jury is still out.<br/><br/>The screenplay isn't bad in terms of character establishment and some of the dialogue is noticeably sharp and effective. The plot is pretty dumb, with some gaping holes in its logic, but this isn't crucial because the story is really just a device to introduce the new crew members and set up further movies. I quite liked the new incarnations of Kirk, Spock, Scottie, Uhura and so on. I would be happy to spend more time with them, subject to one proviso: JJ Abrams must never be allowed near Star Trek again.<br/><br/>For me, all enjoyment of this movie was sabotaged by his hyper-active direction. Every scene (almost every shot) is designed for maximum impact, but that means the movie has no light and shade. There is no change of pace, no pauses for reflection, no steady build up of tension and no overall dramatic arc. It starts with a climax and tries to stay there for the next two hours. But a movie that is all climaxes has no climax. The unvarying pace becomes exhausting and, ultimately, tedious.<br/><br/>Every scene is directed in the same way. Half the dialogue is delivered on the move; people run rather than walk; the camera never stops moving; and most of the shots are too tight. The movie constantly runs the same gamut of visual devices: aerial shots, cranes; whip pans; zooms and endless Steadicam tracks through the crowded sets. The frantic visuals are then cranked up even further by the constant quick cutting. The action scenes, in particular, are all cut, cut, cut.<br/><br/>Orson Welles once said that anyone could make a movie with a six inch lens and a pair of scissors but the test of a good director was what happened between cuts. Clearly, Abrams disagrees. At times, the cutting is so hectic that it seemed as if his contract must have specified that he wouldn't get paid if the camera ever stopped moving or he held a shot for more than five seconds.<br/><br/>As a result, the Enterprise seems to be in a state of constant panic, with the camera zapping from character to character and everyone talking over each other, so that crucial explanatory lines are lost in the perpetual babble. The action scenes, where the cutting gets even quicker and the camera gets even tighter, are often reduced to a flurry of near-indecipherable, almost abstract images.<br/><br/>This over-wrought style of shooting is becoming increasingly common, particularly in big action movies, and it is slowly driving me out of the cinema. However, Abrams manages to raise the irritation factor even higher with another visual affectation that I have always hated.<br/><br/>Lens flare!!<br/><br/>For more than 70 years, avoiding lens flare was one of the basic skills of a cinematographer. Then, in the mid-Sixties, it suddenly became fashionable to let it happen. I always disliked it because it just draws attention to the camera, but it was only a minor irritation in most movies - limited to a few exterior shots where (for example) car headlights shone directly into the lens. The first time it seriously bothered me was in Close Encounters, where it greatly compromised the magic of many of the effects sequences.<br/><br/>By the early Eighties it seemed the vogue for lens flare was dying out, but in Star Trek it is back with a vengeance. Almost every shot in this movie is smothered with light streaks, rainbow effects, bleed over, visual echoes and halos that appear around every dust mote on the lens. Sometimes it is so extreme that the whole screen whites out.<br/><br/>This is not only highly distracting in itself, but it undermines Abrams's whole directorial method. I might not like his high-adrenaline style, but I can appreciate what he is trying to do. The tight shots and the restless camera is trying to draw us right into the centre of the action, so we become part of it. However, the ubiquitous lens flare immediately hooks us out again, putting a barrier between us and what is happening on the screen. It feels like we are standing in the street, watching the whole movie through the reflections on a dirty shop window.<br/><br/>Of course, the blame must be shared by the Art Director, who peppered every set with those bright, low-level lights and with the cinematographer who failed to persuade Abrams to let him him filter out the problem.<br/><br/>Although I regard this movie as an unmitigated disaster, there is no reason why the next movie shouldn't be much better. For me, Star Trek was never really about the characters or the endless elaboration of the Star Trek universe. At its heart, Star Trek was just an efficient vehicle for tackling a wide range of SF ideas. That hasn't changed.<br/><br/>A good SF story typically takes the form of a puzzle that has to be solved by a deadline. In SF books we don't care too much about fine writing or subtle characterisation (although they do no harm). All we really want is an intriguing problem with an ingenious solution. There are still plenty of good SF stories waiting to be told.<br/><br/>Having introduced the new characters and re-launched the series, a couple of good stories is all it will take to make me forget this frustrating aberration.<br/><br/>Despite everything, I am not without hope.<br/><br/>PS: On re-reading this, I still stand by what I wrote, but I also have to acknowledge that Abrams has injected a bit of life into what had become a very stodgy show."
"AlanSKaufman","5","39","66","9 May 2009"," Tears Of Remembrance, Tears Of Sorrow
","Reviewing a remake is always tricky because the new feature can never stand alone, rather it is invariably compared to the original. The new Star Trek movie tries to avoid this dilemma by utilizing the old time warp theme. History is rewritten including the details of how Captain Kirk joined his crew.<br/><br/>The problem isn't so much the story, rather it's the new actors playing the old roles. Don't get me wrong, they all tried hard. Some, especially the new Spock, Doc Bones, and Scotty were downright good imitations, but they were still fakes. Poor Spock, I mean the poor actor, at the denouement he meets up with his future self, played by Leonard Nimoy, the one and only Spock, and is put to embarrassing shame by comparison.<br/><br/>In the TV saga, the Next Generation was the start of new actors portraying new characters carrying on the tradition. Instead of a remake, why couldn't this movie have been like that?<br/><br/>Sure, there were moments in the film when tears formed in my eyes as I recalled the glory days of the original series. But the tears of remembrance merged with tears of sorrow because you can't go home again. Even DVDs of old episodes don't quite bring back the joy of experiencing them for the first time. But contemplating those remarkable old episodes is more satisfying than watching people here play dress up."

"Ufo476","4","9","12","25 September 2012"," What an utter piece of cr...
","This is my first review, and although it may seem spiteful, I believe it is well justified!<br/><br/>Warning! Major spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Well, that was a very good movie for people who are dazzled with sounds and lights- ah, and the brain-dead. But for people who think, that movie was insulting! Lets forget it pays no respect to the original series or its spirit, nor for the details of the original timeline' s character lives. Lets also ignore it presents Kirk like a promiscuous, snorty, arrogant ""rebel without a cause"" guy (which is SO old)! (Arguably there are relevances with the original C. Kirk, but the new version doesn't have his insight or gentleness, and is a lot more superficial). So lets concentrate on everything else.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that, although not enough by itself, nothing can substitute a good storyline- neither acting, nor special effects, not flashy characters. So lets go for the major holes:<br/><br/>1. Major spaceships traveling to past through black holes. Anyone heard of tidal waves who would tear the ship apart?<br/><br/>2. Black holes are all about mass. Super dense mass. You can't make a black hole out of ANY kind of liquid- substanced red matter just by exposing it to thin air (or thin Universe vacuum!). And even if you could, it would take a black hole the mass of Earth (which would have approx 2cm event horizon) weeks to consume a planet like Earth, not minutes!! And if you want to use THAT as a weapon, you just throw it to the surface- the planet's gravity would absorb it to the core! You don't need a super drill at all!<br/><br/>3.Super novas threaten their immediately nearby neighborhood, not the Galaxy (nor even hypernovas!), unless they emit a gamma-ray burst, and then only the star systems located in the direction of the gamma-ray cone. And of course they don't destroy planets outside their solar system! Anyway, where did that blast took place anyway? If it did outside the Romulan system, races that move faster than light would have all the time to take any action necessary (the blast waves can only travel so fast..). If it was the Romulan star that exploded, well, a race with warp capabilities should have read the signs in their sun like, ehm.. a few million years ago! So, totally unrealistic!<br/><br/>4. Besides all these major holes, its the storyline I detested the most. The entire Vulcan planet, home of the most advanced race in Star Trek Universe, and 6 billion Vulcans were gone? How can you like anything with such depressive plot in it? Would we like the movie if Kirk, Spock and the whole Enterprise were gone? No? OK, but the demise of an entire planet (the Vulcans no-less) simply pass by? (unless they go back in time in another movie and fix that)! Total loss...<br/><br/>There were so many other things that didn't make sense in this movie. There was no reasonable rank development for the main characters. Kirk jumps from cadet to captain and all the other crew members reach their final ranks in Enterprise from cadets in the blink of an eye? A huge spaceship severely threatens major planets (Vulcan, Earth) and there are NO spaceships in reserve to stop it at all? In any planet? AND NOT AT ALL AIRFORCE OR GROUND-KEEPING FORCES? Was there any background to Niro at all? And didn't the Vulcan be the original homeworld of the Romulans? So he essentially destroyed his initial homeworld? And what happened to the... thousands of the crew that a ship so big as the Romulan should have? And what was that completely silly story between Spock and Uhura?? How did that relate to any of the original character's characters? And what relation existed between the flamboyant new Uhura and the sweet girl that sang ballads in TOS?<br/><br/>All in all, that movie was a rip- off for money, designed to capitalize on the Star Trek franchise but only got at superficial level. It massively insults our intelligence, both in terms of plot and of science and common sense. They forgotten there is a SCIENCE in science fiction- otherwise its simply fairy tale. This movie is addressed only to people who don't think- and the sad part is that they are so many, that this became an instant hit! Now, the old series often neglected scientific facts as well- its why I never became a huge fun, but at least it had cool story lines and excellent character development. None of these redeeming features are present here, and this is 2010's, not the sixty's- the world has moved since then. But we get the science fiction we deserve.<br/><br/>I so hope they will do something within the Babylon 5 Universe, anything! We need this!<br/><br/>Four/10 stars in respect to the decent efforts of all the actors, the tight plot (with all its flaws), very nice special effects, and overall a good adventure who keeps the interest going. Ah, and the presence of Leonard Nimoy- although he shouldn't have endorsed that movie! However, if they make a series out of this, I won't be watching. I would prefer to see the TOS instead."

The story is amazingly simplistic. It tells us how the crew of the Enterprise first hooked up. The opening scene is quite good with dazzling special effects telling us how Captian Kirk's dad was a great commander, and how he gave his life for the cause. Fast forward to young Kirk, great whiz at galactic war strategy although he seems more at home playing the part of lounge lizard at the local bar. He schemes his way into the training academy and becomes the star of the class. On there maiden training mission, Spock who is the commander makes a mistake, gentlemanly steps aside and lets Kirk be the commander. Leonard Nimoy makes a Back to the Future appearance and helps save the day. BTW he looks like a zombie with all that eye make up. Silly yes, but we are talking about Star Trek. The movie does give us capsule stories of the rest of the crew, but young Kirk and Spock are the stars. This is a well worn plot seen many times in Westerns, Adventure, and Martial Arts Movies, just substitute the back drop. I'll give it 2 stars for the opening scene."

Thought that something would correct the BIG HOLE as it was.<br/><br/>Guess Spock won't be going through the Kolinahr on VULCAN in Star Trek: TMP, and he won't be saved and brought back to Vulcan to have his katra transferred back to Spock in Star Trek 3. Also, in the beginning of Star Trek 4, he won't be talking to his mother (because she is dead now) and won't be on Vulcan (because it's destroyed).... wow.

","NO SPILERS YET: <br/><br/>Some people on the first page of comments say this film is full of character development and has a fantastic story .. they are either mad or were paid to spread hype.<br/><br/>But I'm actually recommending this movie: it is a masterpiece of modern stupidity in film-making. If you define stupidity as something that makes you WIN LESS MONEY, this film is actually VERY CLEVER as it draws in the 80% simian population. A huge success. Or is it just because of the title? Smart stuff either way.<br/><br/>Most insulting is the famous quote spoken by old Spock at the end: ""These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.. its continuing mission, to seek out new life FORMS and new civilizations"" .. I mean.. what the hell.. that's not at all the spirit of what I've seen. How old Leonard Nimoy wants to go down in such junk.. much like a few other great actors lately.<br/><br/>There are two EXCELLENT aspects of this movie: the CGI and WOMEN (there's really only Uhura and an episodic one). They look FABULOUS. Unfortunately, the women part isn't large enough. If it had taken 50% of runtime instead of 3%, as sex scenes, then I would vote this film an 8. CGI enhanced women - I want more of it !<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>Getting started, the captain and crew are so stupid that they don't retreat to a safe distance before the ""monster"" jumps out of the portal. I am awed that their ship is largely disabled with the first volley but then takes ages to suffer more damage. Or that it could stand up for so long against a much larger, much more advanced ship. I find it bad that our vessel doesn't ram at warp and does so at impulse.. maybe I wasn't paying attention to something being disabled.<br/><br/>There is little room for aesthetics during this time of rush, but I find it displeasing. At the end of it we hear a pompous melody and the trek badge with ""Star Trek"" rolling massively in front of our eyes.. not a promising Star Trek kind of thing. Yet, the acting captain's sacrifice back there is possibly the best part of the film.<br/><br/>We find that as a boy Kirk was a delinquent and that Spock was being fed resentment by vulcan bullies: the whole concept of an enlightened Federation is trashed throughout the film and is replaced by contemporary style and attitudes. The most important part of the Star Trek universe was the idea of the enlightened world, at which this film never makes any attempt but then hypocritically ends with ""the voyages"" quote.<br/><br/>Later in life, Jim grows to be a punk, doesn't have any kind of common sense or diplomacy, and gets beaten up in a bar for being a jerk. The real Jim never lost a fight, was genuinely smart and rarely got hit. ""Teen guy"" also has club-boy sex with Uhura's room-mate and makes an ass of himself over again.. the entire scene of which looks great but is retarded. The real Jim was a genius and a formidable charmer. This guy is just a playboy living up to contemporary standards of idiocy.<br/><br/>Spock being romantically involved with Uhura is another attempt at drawing interest, awkwardly timed, and he makes a lousy job with lines of his ""logic"", the kind of which have never been worse done or placed. Her lines are almost as pathetic and shameless to what is happening.<br/><br/>They don't make any attempt to get the ""entering a black hole going back in time"" plausible.<br/><br/>They hand the prize ship to a bunch of teens. Spock is logical until he is stupid. The union of the TOS crew is ridiculously convenient and cheesy.<br/><br/>They place a Nokia in-movie advertisement during the car scene.<br/><br/>When suffering from a gravity well, the ultra-strong ship alloys begin to crack but the gravity generators still work and the people are fine.<br/><br/>The Enterprise turns in front of the black hole, then they say they're at warp and but can't pull out. Adding to that, THEN.. they blow something up behind which makes their greater-than-lightspeed speed even speedier, enough to pull out.<br/><br/>The nemesis is called Nero. NERO !!! Some first-pagers say he's great and needed even more development on-screen! <br/><br/>Kirk jumps off a platform and falls chest-only on another, having fallen 15 meters. He's not jedi, my guess is he broke all his ribs, crushed his lungs and heart, but Q must have pulled one of his tricks again.. the teen gets up and moving. Don't try this at home.<br/><br/>They send only two people, Jim and Spock (highest ranked) on a critical commando mission, instead of sending half the crew at whatever rate the transporter could. The two are rambos. <br/><br/>Conveniently, Checkov lets Spock's mother slip when the cliff falls. The accuracy of the transporter varies chaotically throughout the film.<br/><br/>I'm also annoyed they imploded Vulcan just to satisfy the cheering crowd. They have to go back in time and fix it.<br/><br/>Most of all, I was stupefied by simians seated around me laughing heartedly at the ""The world's dying, I love potatoes"" cockiness / jokes which are spread throughout. Completely out of context, completely miserable by themselves. The whole film is an incoherent piece of junk. Oh, did I mention the music is all pompous and completely out of sync? I already have.<br/><br/>6 = 2 + 3 CGI + 1 for CGI improved WOMEN !!<br/><br/>I once ""heard"" Kirk say ""I must have jumped that 50 times.. scared the hell of me, each time.. except this time.. cause it isn't real."" My guess is that kind of depth and the old days of real Star Trek are long gone."

The characters and elements taken from the original series are fantastic and iconic, but the rest of the movie is a mess and a betrayal of star trek's loyal fans.<br/><br/>There are sooooo many plot holes, that this thing is just a joke. I don't know how anyone can enjoy this movie without a lobotomy or a Kentucky public school education. I won't list them as I want to avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say that this movie has as much science in it as Kansas evolutionary biology class. And the movie is bursting at the seams with Phlebotinum (do a google if you don't know what it is).<br/><br/>Basically, they've taken the cool characters from the original star trek, changed them sufficiently so as to render them annoying, and put them in a weak derivative predictable story.<br/><br/>One thing they have done is made it possible to have new star trek adventures with kinda the same characters as the original series. But to accomplish this, they pretty much destroyed the last 40 years of trek mythology.<br/><br/>if this movie is any indication of what's coming down the pipe, it's just going to be another lame cashing in like return of the jedi and the 3 prequels were. This is most likely the last star trek movie i will ever see, just as phantom menace was the last star wars related thing I saw when I jumped that sci-fi ship."

","i was quite excited to see this remake of star trek so when i got advance screening tickets last Saturday i jumped at the chance to go. The movie starts out with a ridiculously stupid scene of kirks father dying as he rams his ship into the Romulan craft, and of course in the nick of time baby kirk and his mother are saved. we are then introduced to Spock, the only really well cast character in this entire movie and his half breed back story. the film then transitions to Kirk's life before enrolling in the Academy. i wish they would have focused on this section more as it was by far the most interesting part of the movie yet only about 10 minutes was devoted to the set up. Kirk and Spock form a polar opposite of each other and Kirk put on probation for breaking Spocks supposedly unbreakable test, and OH MY GOD right as this happens a distress call is heard from Vulcan... what amazing timing, the fleet is dispatched and Kirk manages to sneak on board. Something that really bothered me was how utterly useless the human spaceships were. the fleet got destroyed in like 2 seconds and it might have well been no resistance whatsoever to the attack. deflector shields just do not exist in this version, although briefly mentioned each shot destroys some part of the ship. Vulcan is destroyed by some Red matter crap which creates a black hole at the center of the planet!! WTF that makes no sense... this is also the scene where we see the ""skydiving"" in the trailer.... you cant enter an atmosphere in just a spacesuit... you would be incinerated! this leads to the most ridiculous fight on this drill ever in which Harold Lee(wheres Kumar) kills two different Romulans...(must have taken a break from that bong) ... not to critic his performance i actually found him to be the only likable member of the crew besides Spock and it at least seemed like he knew the whole thing was comical. the kid that was killed in Alfa dog plays without a doubt the worst and most irritating version of a Russian that i have ever heard. Note to the actor, slurring your words is not a substitute for an accent. The plot from that point gets even more out of control, with elements of time travel coming into play, the villain, Nero, time travels at least three times in the movie... and Spock somehow appears as two separate entities in the film which is not remarked as strange by anyone besides Kirk.then there is an attack on earth, which i guess has absolutely NO defenses anymore, despite our huge star fleet/ missiles we just let the Romuluans start trying to destroy the planet like its no big deal. the only positives to this was Spock, Scotty(the high point of the film by far) and the awesome dude that is Harold... and it looks visually fantastic cons... terrible set up, unlikable hero, no plot, terrible Villain"
"jety2k","1","95","178","6 May 2009"," What was the point?
","Looks to me like vapid and bereft of any talent writing and direction has guaranteed the death of the Star Trek franchise. <br/><br/>Why even bother using the Star Trek name and characters? Those of us who have loved the franchise for the past 40 years are basically being thrown under the bus. It seems more to the point that Mr. Abrams was looking to score a quick ""summer blockbuster"" buck.<br/><br/>The movies target audience is 8 to 18 year olds that know nothing about the original series or movies. I can't believe there is a sequel planed. Oh well there was after all sequels to such masterpieces as ""The Fast and the Furious"". So why not the new and improved(?) Star Trek.<br/><br/>Most assuredly the Star Trek franchise goes the way of Alien, Predator, Terminator and Robo Cop. <br/><br/>Congrats Mr. Abrams!!!<br/><br/>That whirring , helicopter like sound you hear is Gene Roddenberry spinning in his grave."
"fernloth-2","4","18","28","10 May 2009"," Certainly a Star Trek for the present age.
","After viewing this reboot of the original series, I was confused at the critical reaction it has received in the press. After re-reading much of it now, I clearly see the critics tend toward judging the intent of the movie rather than the film itself. In this light, the glowing reviews are perhaps understandable. I, however, left disappointed. <br/><br/>The original Star Trek series was a hokie bit of 60s era sci-fi, however in the midst of the green body paint and plastic ears, a certain amount of dignity and chemistry came to fore. Where circumstances may prove comedically ridiculous, clever social, psychological and even political ideas were played with. Character and relationships were played out with compelling seriousness. Altogether, it created a phenomenon which survived several decades. As in all things, Hollywood has polished up a naturally dying name and slapped it onto a new package. The new era of entertainment is a study in mimicry and this new Trek proves no different. Like the karaoke of American Idol, the words are already written. The tune is familiar. The substance that made the hit, however, is nowhere in evidence. <br/><br/>Abrams' Trek dishes up a series of two-dimensional paint-by-numbers primers on the events that led Spock and Kirk towards their respective destinies. The story never digs. Everything lies lightly on the surface as the movie blows through a scattered plot at warp speed. The connection to the franchise's history is treated so tongue-in-cheek almost to seem parody at times. The actors play their familiar parts in a confusing mix of near impersonation (in the case of Dr. McCoy and Scotty) to bland indifference (as in the case of Kirk). Where character development is neglected, cliché rules the day as Kirk becomes the familiar rebel without a cause figure and the typically soft spoken figure of Uhura is redrawn as a modern day stereotypical rough and tough female. Although Eric Bana plays the Romulan villain Nero with a great deal of evident pain and anger, his back story of obsession is tossed into the mix almost as an afterthought and the film speeds to its conclusion with little connection to anything beyond fast edits, a lot of special effects and a zinger-filled mix of melodramatic and comedic dialog that would do a soap opera credit. While I realize the creators were dealing with an ambitious redrawing, much time and effort wasted on manufactured drama such as the interlude on the ice planet or Scotty's waterpipe ordeal could have better been spent establishing the relationships and characters which were the backbone of the original series, which, let's face it...they've branded themselves with. <br/><br/>Ultimately, however, the critics are right. This will sell. This will achieve what it sets out to do...deliver a Star Trek palatable to today's audience. That they have proved successful is a sad note for a franchise which always looked to the future with hope."
"sjemens","2","53","95","8 May 2009"," Why did they name it Star Trek ?
","My favorite moment of the movie was when Leonard Nemoy said after so many years the famous line ""live long and prosper"". Well that was all that I liked. All in in all it is just a shoot 'em up movie with aliens. There's no connections with the original series. if they changed the well known names from Kirk, Spock, Uhura etc to anything else I'm sure no one could make a connection with Star Trek TOS. Also the scientific inaccuracies were too many. In FedCon in Bonn Nichelle Nichols has said that she 'll be very happy to see the Star Trek movie. Two days later in the same event, answering a question from the audience has said that there is nothing military in Gene Roddenberry's enterprise. I believe she 'll be very unpleased with the way the movie chose to portray a military command warship whose mission is so far away from ""to peacefully explore new worlds"". So, live long and prosper all trekkies and wait for the DVD."

"MrKlette","4","27","45","7 May 2009"," Would you want Bill Gates to design the next Macbook?
","Had it been just another Science Fiction Movie, it would have been a good-average one. But it wasn't. It was Star Trek. At least, it was supposed to be. First of all: it was iconic. Oh yes, you believe it. You liked Bones? You get the best out of him, displayed in a nice showcase, not quite worked up to a character but fun to look at. There are lots of anecdotal hints, there is the typical Star Fleet-atmosphere, the interior designs, the costumes, it is just what you would hope for in a 2009 version of Star Trek. And there is Leonard Nimoy - could you want anything else? Maybe some kind of a plot. OK, lets give them the credit they deserve: the plot was made up around instable Red Matter that creates Black Holes. Nobody could blame them for the fact that the whole plot ended up being sucked into one of those. Lets get this straight: some time in the future, Romulus is endangered by a Super Nova. So they ask the UFP for help. Ambassador Spock is equipped with the newest and fastest ship and Red Matter, that can create Black Holes, to stop the Super Nova. But he is to late to save Romulus, it is destroyed. Now Nero, a Romulan mining- ship Captain on board a heavily armed mining ship (why that? nobody knows) gets sucked into the Black Hole Spock created. Together with him. He is transported back in time to kill Kirk's father (revenge, part one), than waits for Spock, takes the remaining Red Matter (enough to destroy the whole Galaxy, just the way the UFP work: give them enough dangerous material to destroy everything when all they need it a handful - or is it?) and destroys Vulcan, moving on to continue destroying the Earth and the whole UFP. He - who along the way destroyed forty- something Klingon warships, is stopped by Kirk & Co, all the Red Matter creates another Black Hole, and it cannot even fully suck in the Mining Ship. Kirk offers his mercy, Nero rejects, nobody gives a damn (sorry) about the other people on board and they destroy the ship. That is it. As I said, it could have been a nice SF-Flick. But Star Trek? I would have expected more. Plus: the Romulans look like some guys from Gladiator, but not like Romulans (they did better work on Vulcans). And ILM did the Special Effects (a good piece of craftsmanship they are). So the Ship the future Spock uses sounds like a Spacefighter from Naboo, it moves like the Starfighter Obi Wan uses in Episode II and the Warp- Effect reminded me just a tiny little bit of a jumping Star Destroyer. Would you want Bill Gates to design the next Macbook? That is what you get here. And don't get me started on the haphazardness that is used to get the story moving in one or the other places. So: watch it. But do not expect to much, if you are a fan of ST."

","This is what one may call a REBOOT. If you are an old and die hard fan you may not want to see this film.<br/><br/>With that said, the acting was good, the sets and special effects were good as well. The story has many wholes and inconsistencies. However, it makes that up with some good laughs.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie lacked heart or brain, which makes it into a special effects, action movie in space.<br/><br/>This viewer believes that it is good for a causal viewing by a casual fan of Star Trek, or perhaps by non-fans if they dare watch a sci-fi movie without fear of ridicule."

","As one who has followed Star Trek through all of its various incarnations (except for the last three movies and the entire ""Enterprise"" series), I have to say that I am very, very disappointed. <br/><br/>First, THE DESTRUCTION OF VULCAN and THE DEATH OF AMANDA. What, pray, is the point?<br/><br/>I HATE this ill-considered retcon and I HATE time travel plot lines. And I very much doubt if I shall bother to go see future entries in the JJA/ST canon. Unless they somehow revert to the original timeline events.<br/><br/>Well, they gave fair warning, I suppose. Abrams and the writers boasted endlessly that ""This is not your father's Star Trek"", and by the gods of Kronos, they're right about that.<br/><br/>As for the actors: I didn't dig Chris Pine till the end, when he kind of clicked for me. Zachary Quinto was awesome (best line delivery: ""Out of the chair...""). Karl Urban, brilliant. Simon Pegg (Scotty), phenomenal. Kid who played Chekov was preposterously awful. <br/><br/>Zoe Saldana was fine, though I didn't really like the romance plot 'twixt her and Spock: what, no Pon Farr and yet he kisses by all appearances with enjoyment? Bah. <br/><br/>Nimoy's appearance was meh: I knew it was him immediately, just as everybody else did, I'm sure. He sounded a little thick and hissy in his sibilants: perhaps he needs some dental tweakage? <br/><br/>I didn't much care for Winona Ryder or Jennifer Morrison... Liked the Taun-Taun and Wampa critters.<br/><br/>The implosion of Vulcan was amazing to look at, however much I hate the new canon. And speaking of canon: so our well-known crew really did get assembled and in charge of the Enterprise at such tender ages? Seems weird. Don't we have references to all of them on other ships before they ended up on 1701?<br/><br/>But perhaps since it appears that the entire senior class of Starfleet Academy was killed, except for the handful on board the Enterprise, that might explain the rapid promotions...<br/><br/>The movie seemed very dark (as in bad lighting) throughout. The cadet uniforms were ridiculous: red longjohns. I wonder if they had feets. Little spacegoing Dr.Dentons! \ And...RED shirts!!! Bit of a spoiler there, perhaps?<br/><br/>Do not like AT ALL the new swirly transporter effect. But that drill/column of fire thingy was really cool.<br/><br/>That Romulan ship looked waaaaaaay too much like a Shadow ship (Babylon 5) for my liking.<br/><br/>Did I say I really, really hate, loathe, detest and despise time travel plot lines? Because I do.<br/><br/>And sorry, but 10,000 surviving Vulcans are not going to be enough to keep the race going. Even if they breed like bunny rabbits. Oh, wait, once every seven years...well, scratch that.<br/><br/>All in all, very disappointed and deeply annoyed."
"Vartiainen","Null","10","14","3 September 2018"," Shallow action-romp
","I'm a very casual Star Trek fan, and such I had great interest in this movie as an entryway movie into the franchise. Alas, while J. J. Abrams has directed a lot of films I've really liked, this is definitely not one of them.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't like the characters. I'm not hugely familiar with the original TV series, but these still ring false to me. Kirk (Chris Pine) is too brash even for Kirk, Spock (Zachary Quinto) is oddly way too emotional, Scotty (Simon Pegg) engineers very little, if anything at all, and so on. While there were some nice additions and changes - I liked Uhura (Zoe Saldana), for example - they were often in minor roles.<br/><br/>The film is also riddled with plot holes. Which is not that surprising because it is a time travel story - it's hard to avoid plot holes with those - but quite often these plot holes and oddities were there just because the film wanted for its main characters to shine. We have a huge Federation, but it's still a bunch of academy cadets that end up doing everything. Granted, that was pretty much the case in the TV series as well, but in here those crimes are especially egregious.<br/><br/>And while the battles and the special effects do look nice, they're still oddly married to the limitations of the TV series. The ship of the main antagonist almost looks like it came from a particularly fancy student film. That's how cheap looking it is. And that's just from Abrams and his crew trying needlessly to imitate the look of the original shoestring budget TV series.<br/><br/>Not a fan. I did not like the characters, I did not like the plot, I did not like the look. Hopefully the sequel ends up introducing some radical changes."

","I like Star Trek, very much!<br/><br/>It gave me a place where i can go for a vacation virtually in my mind. The whole franchise is based on something, which i can't explain, maybe it has soul. But this movie hasn't.<br/><br/>This movie is large, expensive, fascinating... But not intelligent, and not really Star Trek...<br/><br/>Oh come on! Did you see the big screen on the bridge? It was a windshield, which has almost broken into. In Star Trek there have never been windshields.. they used monitors for God's sake, because they are in space for eg. and it wouldn't be wise to kill accidentally all of the head staff just because the windshield's break... <br/><br/>And did you see the colors of the New-Old Enterprise? It looks like it has been built by the Star Wars Empire Shipfactory... The design is nearly the same as the Deathstar's or Leia's ship. And where are those red doors? Where are the red bussard collectors? (the base of the Starfleet architecture...)<br/><br/>And what about Picard/Janeway/Sisco and many others? This new movie has put their story into brackets... They easily made a new universe, so their work will be easy in storywriting. If they'll have a problem just create an other universe, so you don't have to use your brain to complicate a bit... <br/><br/>And Nero, was nobody... A miner who wants revenge for his wife (What a smart and brilliant character isn't he?)...

"mylucylumpkins","2","7","9","28 May 2014"," Volumes Could be written about what a disgrace this film was...
","Honestly, I could fill university text books with how this film is not only terrible as a stand-alone film, but also an insult to the Star Trek legacy. For purposes of efficiency I have itemized the major downfalls based mainly on the lack of clear conceptualization of plot and character rather than the lack of a talented cast, although in all fairness horrible acting did contribute to my overall disdain for the film. The absolute main concern I have with the film, and I feel the majority of TOS fans have, is that nothing about the films uphold the ideals and values of Star Fleet or the United Federation of Planets. I know it sounds oober nerdy, but stick with me here, Star Trek owes most of it's success to these elements of peaceful quests for knowledge and a responsibility of Star Fleet personnel on behalf of an advanced human civilization on Earth and Earth colonies on other planets. It is a character driven show whose greatness is amplified by fantastic stories as told by master storytellers. As great as the science fiction sets and effects were for the time, they were merely tools implemented by the storytellers. All of this being said, it is clear what direction this review will follow:<br/><br/>*Captain Kirk: Captain Kirk is an honorable man. He is occasionally mischievous, but always in a calculated and clever way in order to benefit the greater good (The Enterprise Incident). He is in no way a common street thug, as portrayed in this film. His bravery and passion for adventure is due to his deep devotion to the Prime Directive, not a deep urge to rebel and cause chaos. <br/><br/>*Mr. Spock: Mr. Spock is a fan favorite for many obvious reasons. His expansive knowledge combined with a quick wit and a rare emotion makes him a very likable character. Also, he is an alien, a friendly alien who is not feared but respected by his counterparts. Occasionally there are characters with a dislike for him, but that is generally turned around within the span of an episode. The new Mr. Spock is seeping emotion, even when he is trying not to emote, he is projecting anger. <br/><br/>*Dr. McCoy: I know I said I would not bring up acting, but really, there is no way not to on this one. As bad as the others were, this role was not essential enough in this film to focus on anything but this horrible acting. DeForest Kelley actually had a southern drawl, naturally, it was not just part of the character, it is what he brought to the character. Karl Urban has very forced emotion and an extremely forced southern accent. Even down to facial gestures and body movement, it is like watching a high school play with an overzealous lead. <br/><br/>*Lieutenant Uhura: This was just... a tragedy. Lieutenant Uhura is a strong, self-assured woman. She is usually the only female and only African American aboard the bridge of the Enterprise, yet she strives in this environment. She is occasionally playful, but all within the realm of respect to her duties aboard the ship and the role she plays in the productiveness of the bridge. She is a leader and an inspiration. The new film managed to take all of the meaning from this role. In this film, she is nothing but a love interest. By playing up the (ridiculous) relationship she has with (an over- emotional) Spock, it belittles the importance of her individual character. <br/><br/>*Story Vs. Effects: A film should never have these two factors playing against each other, bidding for favorites in a battle for popularity. In that respect, the story lost. I would love to do a survey, right after closing credits, ""In your own words, what was this film about? What were the details of the plot and the main focuses of the film?"". I am positive most of the answers would be somewhere in the ballpark of ""not quite sure"". It was the major complaint I've heard about the film. Story faults aside, the filmmakers spared no expense in the visual effects department. It was all top of the line, most advanced, and completely useless computer generated effects. By making the focus of the film the science fiction favorite effects of phasers, space crafts, and outer space, creators lead the film even farther from what Star Trek stands for and what it means to fans. <br/><br/>As well-received and possible well-liked as this film is, I think that it failed among true fans. There were simply too many flaws in too many essential aspects of Star Trek mythology. It is a black hole in the Star Trek universe, but fortunately for it, it is not a lone failure. As generation after generation try in vain to recreate the success of Star Trek The Original Series, this franchise reboot will most likely go on until it is not longer profitable. Even after this chapter is closed, true fans will always have TOS."

","Was it Star Trek or the Star Wars trilogy, from what I hear far more like the latter. I have seen repeats of classic Trek and read many of of the novels based off the original television series, first class example of bastardization of a television series icon. Sadly our society has declined where people with poor taste idolize obvious garbage. Who cares how unrealistic (stupid) a plot is as long as you have great special effects. Robert April was the first captain of the Constitution class Enterprise. War with the Romulans took place about 10 yrs. after Zefram Cochrane's historic flight. We fought them in vessels referred to as darts. We and the Romulans did not have ship to ship audio or visual communications, no phasers, shields, transporters (*Star Trek episode Balance of Terror, which aired Dec. 15, 1966.). The bastardized remake made it appear the entire bridge crew attended Star Fleet Academy at the same time, which clearly is not possible Kirk is at least 10 years older than Sulu, and Uhura and 12 years older than Chekov. It is mentioned repeatedly in Classic Trek that the only 1 of the crew Kirk knew from his academy days was McCoy. Although they died in the episode Where No Man Has Gone Before, aired September 22, 1966 James Tiberius Kirk before being promoted to rank of captain had served with and was a friend with Lt. Cdr. Gary Mitchell and Lt. Lee Kelso."

","There is no doubt that this is a bold telling of the origins of the NCC-1701 and its fledgling crew. And the story is compelling. The acting is very good. There are some details though that really curl my piggy tail. No one, in any universe would believe that Uhura and Spock are romantically involved and that Spock would allow himself PDA on the transporter pad. That's too much by itself. Then we see Kirk attaining the rank of Captain by trickery and the destruction of Spock's self-confidence. Not the way I would have imagined.<br/><br/>I love the assertion that Kirk is a bad boy. That's a given. Spock coming from a planet that is so populated that there is not a square inch of grass is trying. (Where will the combat between Spock and Kirk take place?) The worst is that we're shown that the planet Vulcan is completely destroyed. How many planets of Vulcan can and will there be? Integral to the plot of the movie but its a thumbing of the nose to the Star Trek universe that we've loved and respected for over 40 years. Creating a universe from scratch can be a real chore but it can be a curse. If you're gonna throw the baby out with the bath water (replacing long held Trek dogma for that which looks good on film) is not honorable. It becomes like the lie that covers the next lie. <br/><br/>I think the real treasure in this film was Checkov. He was simply adorable and a real treat. A real surprise. Who knew he was so good at math and so confident at Public Addresses.<br/><br/>Normally, seeing Leonard Nimoy is a rare privilege but he says his lines so drolly and so robotlike its hard to take him seriously. Also, no insult intended but he looks every day of his 78 years. He looks very old and very frail.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is so busy, there's little time to enjoy the intricacies of the characters or the increasingly complicated plot.<br/><br/>Many things could have been done better.

","Voted 1. Should be a 0 - Blair Witch as a cartoon awful. Bangs and thuds, red shirts tumbling to their doom, bangs and thuds, bad guys falling to their doom, black holes that are very selective in what they 'eat' . . and so on. It's a blend of anti-science and fantasy that separates this monstrosity from science fiction, and from Star Trek. That is, much looks similar to Star Trek. But then it becomes an overproduced ripoff of Star Trek themes and designs, similar to some low-budget TV series that never quite gets picked up.<br/><br/>Abrams and the PR campaign had, it's true, told the fans of Trek to stay clear of his film. Wasn't for those who grew up on Trek, he said. This was for a new and credulous 'generation' who, I suppose, have never even heard reference made or seen so much as a parody of the series - which is most unlikely, if I might paraphrase our favorite Vulcan. The boomers who write TV shows have been referencing Star Trek for at least the last 20 years that I've watched commercial television.<br/><br/>What the writers did, after speaking with Nimoy and getting back to him with a script, after his approval that is, was to take the characters of the bridge crew from the original series (TOS) and take them back to childhood, or at least their late teens (except for McCoy who was older). The actors dutifully looked the part, and adopted some of the mannerisms, and more often the clichés of the adult characters who created the franchise. But the adults were in their mid-30 to 40s. The kids are 10-15 years too young to be aboard THAT Enterprise. And it shows up particularly when baby-Kirk, this mock-Kirk from this mock-Trek film, early 20s, no command experience, just out of the academy is promoted to the captain's chair on the flagship of the fleet. All other officers were in the head, at the time, so one must assume.<br/><br/>But then one must assume something similar of an entire race established in the series, the race of Romulans. They looked like Vulcans, except in this mock-Trek, where they look like the post-apocalyptic rabble of Mad Max, Waterworld or Aliens III. They had fleets of ships. But in this mock-Trek, they sit around on Romulus, refuse to colonize other planets or else call everyone back, ground every space ship, one must assume, and wait merrily for a supernova to destroy them - when by all science, a red giant should have done that, long, long before. Apparently, Ambassador Spock of Vulcan is coming to their rescue, in a sort of slow moving rotating shuttle of some kind. Save us, Spock! ? If the Romulans of the story were threatened by their sun dying, they'd not only have plenty of time to evacuate the system - they would have done that, and taken everything that, as it were, wasn't nailed down.<br/><br/>Spock's cure was something called 'red matter'. Apparently, a single drop is all that was needed to somehow stop a supernova. But Spock brought half a quart. It's never explained why. So he falls out, not in, but out of a black hole (that's right), completely intact, and is captured by the villain. The villain takes a drop of Spock's red juice and destroys Vulcan. A couple of members of the high council, so-called, were trading recipes as the cavern they were in was about to fall apart on this utterly defenseless Vulcan (oh my, a giant laser beam from space, what-ever shall we do? Saave us, Spock!), as mock-Spock, the younger self, dashes in to say - HEY! you, navel-gazers, didn't you know the planet's breaking up, get the frick out of this cave - come ziss me if you vant to live? A couple of council members are predictably crushed by falling effects. Now a new 'homeworld' must be found. And the same question - what about the millions of Vulcans on other worlds, or were they also all ordered home at the same time? Didn't they have high councils, and independent governments, etc? The whole film is just a lazy, back-of-the-napkin Hollywood action film. You probably get your money's worth for all the nonsense on the screen, however bizarre and self-contradictory so much is if you stopped to think about it. But it moves along, and explodes, and goes BANG, and seems to be about something - like sports announcers always screaming the broadcast, no matter how boring the game.<br/><br/>But since they changed so much about the backstory, while trying to retain young doppleganger versions of the bridge crew from the original, it's a film that doesn't draw you in. It spits at you. It shrieks at you. It says - fool, you paid to see this roller coaster ride. 'E' ticket. But you'll get bored. And this sure isn't Star Trek. The Enterprise doesn't have an engine room that looks like a brewery or sewage treatment plant - the warp engines run on steam power? The fleet isn't commanded by a bunch of 20-year amateurs who fly right into a closed-umbrella 'death star' space station disguised as a 'mining' vessel.<br/><br/>A mock-Trek may be what some wanted to see. Malicious screen-writing. Malevolent production. Nimoy - WHAT were you thinkg? You are not Spock, your book title. Yeah, we get that. Doesn't mean you have to dump all over the franchise. So you're not Spock. Let it go! Or else, sick of Trekkers. Sick of constant Trek references in sitcoms and whatever else. No more Trek. This isn't your 'Daddies' Trek. This isn't any kind of Trek at all! Not in any way. It's bait n switch, it's theft of a franchise in order to stomp all over it. What's more, it's just bad film-making, which failure and contempt can't be rescued by a floor of competently produced stunts and effects."

","Yes, as a die-hard trekkie back to the original series, I admit bias.<br/><br/>But let me say, through all of the years of good bad and ugly star trek movies and series, no movie, even that horrific Insurrection, so completely spat on Star Trek the way this movie did.<br/><br/>So, young Spock. Stole the show, and excellent job btw. So why did the writers have to make him such an A-hole??? I HATED his character! Stranding a guy on a frozen planet is normal punishment? That was very nearly a 5 minute death sentence, the real Spock would NEVER have done that! And oh yeah, we are just going to now BUMP into the old Spock! (In a frikken ice cave!) WTF??????? Is that your pathetic attempt to save the movie? Is there some unwritten code somewhere that to guarantee success of your Star Trek movie, the Old Spock must somehow put in an appearance somewhere? Blowing up Romulus... I just can't even go there. You don't completely destroy a major race in the Star Trek mythos, just 'cause your some jerk director who wants to do things different. That's called Jumping the Shark, and was just ludicrous. What's next, the Klingons all mutate into giant easter bunnies? Why does the futuristic Romulan ship look like a giant octopus? Do you not know what Romulan ships look like? Kirk? Again, A-HOLE. Hated him. Horrible acting job, and HORRIBLE characterization of the young Kirk.<br/><br/>Scotty? Ludicrous. Just get Lister off Red Dwarf and be done with it.<br/><br/>Bones saved some of the day, excellent characterization and excellent job of him.<br/><br/>Why, oh why, can you explain, does the ancient first Enterprise look way more advanced and super hot-roddy than the original series Enterprise, which comes along many years later? Hmmmm? Oh. Because the director doesn't give a damn. It shows in SPADES in this movie, and now, because this travesty, this mockery to the Star Trek mythos has been made, we must endure it as CANON, in all our computer games, books, cartoons, what have you.

","Admittingly, I have to say I did not want to see Star Trek, even though the trailer looked interesting, I thought this film was only going to be for the fans of the TV series and no one else would get it. I did watch the show with my father when I was a child, but it never caught on with me to keep watching it. But after hearing some really great reviews, I decided to go ahead and check the movie out and honestly I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed this movie and the reason why? It was like a prequel, not just meant for the fans, but how these famous characters came to be. This is everything a summer blockbuster is meant to be, fun characters, great adventure, fun effects and a good interesting story. Not only that, but this movie was so much fun to watch and it may make me even get back into the show.<br/><br/>Captain Nero of the Romulan mining ship Narada attempts to exact revenge on Spock, whom he blames for the destruction of his home world and its inhabitants, including his wife and unborn child. Both ships, however, are caught in the black hole's event horizon and travel into the past. Acting-Captain George Kirk orders an evacuation and stays behind to provide cover for the fleeing shuttle craft, his pregnant wife among the passengers. George pilots the Kelvin into the Narada moments after his son James Tiberius Kirk is born. Kirk grows up to be an intelligent, though reckless and cynical, young man. To get him to embrace his potential, Captain Christopher Pike challenges Kirk to emulate his father's heroism and convinces him to join Starfleet. In his third year at the Academy, Kirk is accused of cheating on the test by its programmer, Commander Spock. At the resultant hearing, Starfleet receives a distress signal from Vulcan that indicates the appearance of a lightning storm in space, and the cadets are mobilized to help crew the ships in orbit. McCoy smuggles the grounded Kirk aboard the USS Enterprise as a patient under his care. Kirk recognizes the similarities between the Vulcan incident and the encounter that destroyed the Kelvin, and warns Pike that the fleet is heading into a trap. arrives and beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock away before the collision, which ignites the remaining red matter and creates a black hole within the Narada's superstructure. Kirk offers to help rescue Nero and his crew, but the Romulan refuses and the Narada is destroyed. The Enterprise escapes the same fate by ejecting and igniting the ship's warp drive reactor cores, the resulting explosion pushing them clear. Kirk is promoted to captain of the Enterprise, relieving the newly-promoted Admiral Pike.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Star Trek is a very good film, besides the effects and story, what really made the film work was it's actors. Chris Pine did a good job as Captain Kirk, even though the rebellious stage was a little over done, he still pulled it off with the right sense of cockiness and powerful leadership. But the man who takes over the film for me was definitely Zachary Quinto who played Spock, not only did he look like him(I'm surprised he and Leonard Limoy are not related) but what a performance, this kid is going to make it big. Simon Pegg was also the perfect selection for the role of Scotty, I don't think they could have had a better actor. Star Trek was a great film, I'm glad I got to see it, I definitely recommend it on the big screen, but if you're waiting for the rental, it's all good, it's a great movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Even with just a passing interest in the Star Trek series it won't be long before you find yourself cringing at this new film version, especially at seeing those old familiar characters 're-imagined' as entirely predictable B-movie goons.<br/><br/>Sorry Star Trek fans, it seems that your beloved crew are actually a collection of spoilt brats, who beat, pilfered, and cheated their way to the top, and your favourite franchise has just gone warp-factor into deep cliché. <br/><br/>Firstly, it's fair to say there are plenty of punches to the new film, by that I don't mean surprises -there are few real surprises- I mean smashing into a person's face with fists if or when they say or do something you object to, like an angry toddler or a thug might, although it appears that in the future this kind of conflict resolution is all just fine. <br/><br/>The first we see of James T Kirk he's stealing and wrecking a car as a boy, then, later in life, we see him boozing and punching people. Far from being shunned as an anti-social man-baby, Kirk is considered 'the right stuff' and welcomed into officer training school. Spock, we discover, also spent his youth rolling around bashing his peers, those who mocked him for his mixed half-human half-Vulcan heritage -a metaphor about dealing with racism? Perhaps, although we never see him, or anyone else, take Dr McCoy to task who constantly refers to Spock as a 'pointy-eared bastard'. <br/><br/>While there are no actual punches thrown by McCoy the poison darts come thick and fast as he clearly has problems mixing-in, however, among the multi-stereotypical crew, Spock is the main recipient of his furtive jibes -perhaps because he attracts too much attention from Kirk, whom McCoy openly refers to as a 'prize stallion'.<br/><br/>In addition to all the space-age punching and name-calling, contact wrestling also features heavily in events. How better to solve the problems of the universe than with some manly wrestling? Kirk gains captaincy of The Enterprise by provoking Spock into a violent rage in order to demonstrate Spock's emotional unsuitability for the top job. He is able to do this as Spock has recently survived a holocaust (with his home planet, his Mother, and most of his race reduced to dust) and is therefore ripe for a bit of teasing about it. With Kirk in a stranglehold, Spock is relived of his post, while Kirk, the brawling-sociopath and stowaway, is considered 'the right stuff' and given command. <br/><br/>Obviously, no big budget Hollywood space epic would be complete without a handgun-wrestling scene. How better to confront a genocidal alien maniac from the future than with a handgun and some wrestling moves? WATCH as the pistol falls to the floor in the struggle, WHO will pick it up?<br/><br/>One way or another the bad guy, of course, MUST be shot to death with guns. In this villain's final moments there is a glib nod towards diplomacy as Kirk offers assistance to the now disintegrating alien ship, the offer is refused, so they duly speed along it's demise by shooting at it with big guns -much to the satisfaction of crazy hot-head Spock who doesn't much like the sound of a pity these days. Stay with this film long enough and you are sure to discover that the real crazed villains are actually the writers, and, in an uncanny reflection of their own storyline, they too worm their way into the past to plunder and destroy. <br/><br/>Without wishing to delve any further into the shallows of the other 'characters' and 'plot lines'- it would be an overwhelming task to chart all the inconsistencies and plagiarisms- the film as a whole can be fairly summed-up as: an indiscriminate collection of second-hand ideas crudely strung together with casual violence, or alternatively as: a homoerotic cartoon of dysfunctional male egos before backdrop of galactic tomfoolery.<br/><br/>Could it be, that when planning this film, Director Abrams and his associates took the view that making a Star Trek movie that appealed mainly to established fans was to miss out on other vast untapped markets? Markets of bullies perhaps, criminals, or wrestling fans? In one way, at least, the film does live up to it's hype: This is not your Dad's Star Trek -because, of course, your Dad's Star Trek had merit, and likable characters, and dramatic aspirations, and amounted to so much more than this, the basest of Hollywood crowd-pleasing."
"ljosweep","1","12","18","5 December 2009"," ADD version of Star Trek -- Terrible
","As a fan of the original series and several of the movies, I had heard people's favorable comments about this movie and expected a lot more.<br/><br/>This movie is fast-paced for today's dumb-downed Star Wars generation of attention deficit disorder movie-goers. What I have the biggest problem with is the inconsistency and lack of commitment to the Star Trek background, a complete lack of continuity with the established sub-creation maintained through the series and previous movies.<br/><br/>As just a few examples: In the real Star Trek, Chekov was 12 years younger than Kirk, and would have been a child when Kirk had just finished cadet school. Never mind that the Chekov here was an outright mockery and parody with a stupid accent far worse than the original.<br/><br/>In the previous mention of the Kobayashi Maru test (Star Trek II), all that was said was that Kirk got a commendation for original thinking; he did NOT get an academic suspension.<br/><br/>This movie made a mockery of the serious, military analogy to Star Fleet service. Kirk here is a jerk, a juvenile delinquent who gets on the Enterprise as a stowaway, then gets promoted up to Captain through outrageous antics that make Wesley Crusher's ""saving the ship"" plots look tame. We are told that this story is an alternate timeline due to what Spock did in the future, but the timeline is never corrected. Never mind that the ""true"" Kirk had served on other ships between cadet school and the Enterprise, such as on the USS Farragut as a lieutenant 11 years before being captain. Never mind that the ""true"" Kirk had behaved himself properly, as enough of a model student that he had never ""beat the tar out of Finnegan"" for pranks done by the upper-classman to the younger Kirk; this Kirk is constantly acting up and causing trouble throughout his time at the academy. All of the other characterizations are likewise mockeries and parodies of the established series.<br/><br/>Star Fleet didn't even know about the Romulans, or what they looked like and their similarity to Vulcans, until half-way through Season 1; here, a story supposedly years before that event, the background of Romulans is already known.<br/><br/>The basic plot of a vengeful character going around destroying complete planets with such ease puts this in the same category as Star Wars and comic book fiction -- but it loses all believability within the Star Trek realm, which at least had stories with more restrained and somewhat more believable plots."

Kirk just HAPPENS to get marooned on that exact ice planet, right near future Spock's cave? Scotty just HAPPENS to be in walking distance, too? In the climax, The Romulans just HAPPEN to fire that drill right next to the Golden Gate Bridge for all of Star Fleet to see and inexplicably run toward (not away from) like it's an ice cream truck? The Enterprise could barely escape the black hole at warp speed, but somehow, immediately next to it, Earth is left untouched? In the future, everyone is going to talk and act like a kid from 2009, even in the military, complete with clichéd teen angst? By the time teenager Kirk was handed the ship at the end, which made zero sense whatsoever, I was laughing out loud.<br/><br/>I could go on. There was zero imagination or vision. There was no deeper meaning or morality tale like what made Star Trek, Star Trek. If Gene Roddenberry wasn't already dead, this would probably have done him in. Was there some bet between producers on how many Star Trek catchphrases they could shoehorn in? It was like a parody at times. The only good character was Dr. McCoy, that kid nailed it.<br/><br/>The only thing that kept it from being a complete waste of time was Zoe Saldana's looks."

","This movie is in my oh so unworthy opinion a piece of trash directed by a guy who directed the LOST series. Hardly a qualification to embark on helping to produce a Star Trek movie. The reason I say that this is an abomination is because it simply does not live up to the high standards that were set in the original series, The next generation, voyager, deep space nine and even, though I personally do not like the latest series, Enterprise. It completely throws everything ever written except the character names out the window and in doing so, creates its own timeline, the movie does not spend enough time explaining this and even the explaining it does provide is dodgy and scetchy at best. If you want to watch this movie out of curiosity, be warned, you will be disappointed if you had any love for the original series."

He now has human emotions and love affairs which ruins his character. He is just another human now, nothing special or unique. That ruins the whole movie. It makes it SUCK! A lot of parts of the movie are taken from other movies, such as the one where young Kirk drives the vintage corvette off a cliff, you would think you were watching Vin Diesel in one of his movies. Abrams seemed to forget where and what Star Trek was all about when Gene Roddenberry created it. If he cant get the characters right, maybe he should retire or let someone who knows Star Trek edit its stupidity out of it."
"locutus12","4","8","11","3 March 2011"," Bad ""popularist"" rubbish for the new uninformed masses. *spoilers*
","This film was so obviously written for the folks who have never seen good scifi and are more entertained by *bang* *bang* *whizz* *pop* special effects and relatively good action than for a good star trek story.<br/><br/>Now I know all trek films have their issues and plot wholes (*cough NEMESIS...) but this one really takes it to new levels of ""lets treat the audience like idiots and throw eye ball popcorn at them"" and what's worse is most people seem to have fallen for it, which frankly makes me despair.<br/><br/>My issues: (and yes I know some are VERY geeky, but Im a huge fan of well written SciFi and I don't like being treated like an idiot) 1) Uhura orders a cardassian drink at the bar. Yet the cardassians were not discovered until Piccards day... (anyone remember the references in TNG to a bad first contact situation resulting in a 12 year war?!) 2)Nero's ship... a ""mining vessel"", just happens to be the size of a bloody borg cube and armed to the teeth...<br/><br/>3) Nero hung around that area of space for a couple of decades waiting for spock? (they cut out a 20 minute sequence of the film where his ship and crew were captured by the Klingons... this would have explained allot so why cut it?) 4) The Romulan Star Empire, a hugely powerful race, that has harnessed the power of miniature black wholes to power their MILE long ships, DIDN'T know roughly when their own sun would explode!!? We know now ""roughly"" when ours will go pop and we are comparatively cave men.<br/><br/>5) the ONLY person in the entire empire, out of all of its scientists, that could help them, was one crusty old vulcan.<br/><br/>6) Red Matter... a substance so powerful, that a single drop in a planets core, can collapse an entire world in on itself in a matter of minutes. So they give Spock enough of it to destroy a small galaxy, on a barely armed ship.<br/><br/>7) When Vulcan gets attacked, they clearly state the fleet is away dealing with another issue... THE ENTIRE FLEET. HUNDREDS OF SHIPS, ALL OF THEM?!?!? are too busy and too far away to come to the aide of the second most important planet in the federation, leaving ONLY a few hundred snot nosed cadets, a hand full of ships they were all training on, and, for some reason, the flag ship.<br/><br/>8) Vulcan gone. So they blew it up, great for action and drama, but a complete *beep* of star trek, without the vulcan science academy, the federation wont develop half the technologies employed in TNG, Voyager, DS9. The borg would have slaughtered them for a start.<br/><br/>9) The new bridge... IKEA ? 10) The new warp effect... You can tell Abrams is a STAR WARS nut.<br/><br/>11) The new ship and its bulbous nacelles... *sigh* 12) Lt Uhura... or Lt Awhore? lets water down a role that played a vital part of the black rights movement in the united states during the 60's. Nichelle Nichols was going to leave the show at one point due to her never having any decent lines. Martin Luthor King Turned up, on her doorstep! and convinced her to stay in the show as she was a symbol to black people everywhere during that time.<br/><br/>It also featured the first interracial kiss in US TV history.<br/><br/>Now though, she's just eye candy with loose knickers.<br/><br/>13) The engine room... someone went out to home depot, and bought a few hundred feet of air conditioning ducting and painted it orange.<br/><br/>14)Crew Conduct. All previous treks, no matter the film, no matter the series, all understood that, in principle, Starfleet is a Military organisation. It has its procedures, its respect, its edge.<br/><br/>This lot are running around like school girls at a bake sale.<br/><br/>There are many more problems with it, but I could go on, and on, and on.<br/><br/>Things I liked: I liked Chris Pine's Shatner, and Zachary Quinto's Spock. Though I find the film totally flawed, their performances deserve great credit and they had obviously paid great care and attention to the mannerisms of their former actors, shatner and nimoy.Eric Bana also did his role proud.<br/><br/>But over all. This film killed 40 years of History for me, all for the sake of a ""fresh"" and ""dumbed down"" audience, in pursuit of the ever wanted $$$."
"ShogaNinja","2","13","20","17 June 2009"," The Last Non-Com in the Galaxy
","First off, where is Captain Christopher Pike? He was the Captain of the Enterprise before Kirk. Where is he?<br/><br/>Any military entity is a meritocracy. That is to say, that each person is judged based on their merits and achievements, not their race, class, or gender. In order to make your way up through a meritocracy, you guessed it, you gotta EARN it! So, apparently there were no other officers in the galaxy because Kirk went through several ranks to get to the top in one day. Let's go through them now. First you start out as a cadet for 4 years ( 4 YEARS just like college). Then you become the first officer rank, which is Ensign (En-Sin). After a couple years of being an ensign or more, you can become a Lieutenant, J.G. or Junior Grade. Again after a couple years of that, you get to become a regular old vanilla Lieutenant. Now that you finally made Lieutenant, after several years of that you can become a Lieutenant Commander ( just referred to as the rank of Commander if in front of people of lower rank, but in the presence of a higher rank, the whole term is used). Now you are where Data was for 7 years on TNG. After that, you can become a Commander, like Will Riker, but you got to pass some tests on how to command a ship, namely, you must kill off one of your crew in order to pass. It's a harsh lesson, but being in command can be tough. Then after a really long time, a decade perhaps, you can become a captain. It's fair to say that Kirk was always the youngest captain but 16 is a bit absurd. If you look at the captains of today you get older gentlemen like Cpt. Sully. Captains are old, it's the way of things. IF anyone would have gotten a battlefield promotion it would have been Spock first ( a LT. Commander IIRC in this movie) or any of the hundreds of other OFFICERS aboard the ship, not the cadet. That's like saying that you can take the best high school kid in the world and stick him on a plane to fly it. Good luck with that. Not to mention that in a meritocracy, since you have to work your way up, that others had already done so, and they would NEVER sit idle and watch a cadet sail past all their years of hard work only to become subordinate to a Non-Com. This would never happen. Not now, and not in the 2300's. The problem with Star Trek sometimes, is that they forget that all of this supposed future knowledge must actually be built on the knowledge we already have. For example, Naval battles have been waged for thousands of years. Tens of thousand. Study Naval History before you even attempt to write anything to do with a starship.<br/><br/>So Kirk went from a(non-commissioned)Cadet, to an (commissioned) Ensign, Lieutenant Junior Grade, Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander, Commander, then Captain. Maybe he will make Admiral next movie at this rate. It only took Kirk decades after all. <br/><br/>Secondly, there is no Cardassian ale because Cardassians weren't discovered until the Next Generation which is some 40 years in the future. I thought J.J. Abrams said he did his homework. If he had he would never have released this garbage and tried to pass it off as something any fan of the show could enjoy. This is what you get when you use a flashy director who has NO experience as a ST fan. Terrible. For me this will be the new spin off that simpletons can watch. It is not part of Star Trek if you ask me.<br/><br/>The Romulan Captain Nero acts nothing like Romulans act. I can't go into the many nuances that make a Romulan, but at least in the TOS time period they were very Roman (thus the name Nero, but the comparison stops there). Terrible villain.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, J.J. Abrams should stick to confusing the heck out of Lost fans, and stay the heck away from Star Trek. Star Trek came out in 1969. That's 40 years ago. You don't mess with 40 years of work so you can attempt to sell a blockbuster ( you failed to break $300 Million so you aren't a blockbuster). This movie is terribly written and anyone who knows ANYTHING about Star Trek knows that this is a steaming pile of inconsistent garbage. Could you imagine if he wrote a series when he can't even get the facts of a 2 hour movie right? How does this guy keep track of Lost for Pete's sake?<br/><br/>Which brings me to my last point. If you add up all the Star Trek episodes and movies across all of the series you arrive at a number of 545 hours of video. It took me an entire year of watching to get through all of the material. You don't ignore 40 years and 545 hours just so you can make a movie any way you want and call it a reboot. You do not ignore such a vast history, and say that yours is new and better, when you weren't even willing to work for it. If you can't hack reading the Star Trek Manual required to write anything under this universe then you shouldn't be writing for Star Trek. Period. This movie will go down in history like New Coke, and Crystal Pepsi. They will be rebooting too this by the next installment."

Bravo to them and the others who despite their lack of physical appearance captured their characters beautifully and best of all McCoy!<br/><br/>Nero must have been the best bad guy if not a bit underplayed I have seen on a Star Trek Movie. I mean you know your in trouble when you in the middle of a fire fight and you hail the bad guy. ""This is Captain Christopher Pike of the Enterprise!"" And the enemy responds cool as can be. ""Hey Chris, I'm Nero, how are ya doing?"" <br/><br/>The Uniforms were very well done, giving the very future look yet still nearly Identical to the Original.<br/><br/>The Special effects... I hate to say were alright but not up to par with what I expect from Star Trek. <br/><br/>HOWEVER! (Now comes the fun part.)<br/><br/>I have been a hard core Trekker all my life, I could walk the decks of all Enterprises in the series without getting lost if placed on them and understand the Engineering and Science babble as more then just ""Ummm OK they said something bad will happen."" So believe me when I say this breaks my heart!<br/><br/>First problem... TIME TRAVEL! AGAIN? My god there are over 2,000 races in the Star Trek Universe why can't we tell a Trek Story without Time Travel?<br/><br/>Second Problem... J.J. Abrams has successfully done what Berman tried and failed miserably to do, rewrite Star Trek! OK I get the Idea of capturing the next generation of fans, thats great. But in my day Gene Roddenberry came up with a great way of doing that ""Without"" rewriting it It was to Bring in a new cast and crew! You know TNG? Did it for a great reason as well, Star Trek is about looking forward not back! Stop the Prequels and put the money into a new series that picks up where Voyager left off... Or from further in the future then Voyager! But please honor the Heart of Star Trek, ""Boldly go where no one as gone before."" NOT ""Boldly go where we've already been and here's my take on it!"" ((Glances around manically)) Ummm OK sorry.<br/><br/>Third Problem... State of the art Bridge, awesome! Sickbay, Awesome! They even made the hull look good (Though I did like the old design better) Why the HELL did the Engine room look like something from an old WWII submarine! I mean the whole room was nothing but pipes with Steam release valves all over the place! Why???? I mean there was no Engine it was all steam pipes? What does the Warp drive work off Steam?? Come on!<br/><br/>So all and all would I see the next one? Yea I guess I would if only in hopes of improvement. But this was the first Trek movie I've ever seen and not walked out of the theater with chills down my spine and a burning desire to see again. That does hurt to say.<br/><br/>DO I recommend it? Well lets put it this way, I your a true trekker like me you'll see it no matter what I say, if your not then most of what I said won't matter to you anyway and it would still be a good movie for the next Gen.

The plot was just plain weak, merely a setup for the gang to get together, and would someone please, please, tell their friends in Hollywood that, if you're going to make a mega movie, the least you can do is hire a high school kid for technical direction, since it seems that no one in L.A. has passed 4th grade science. Okay, things like warp drive and transporters, that's okay, they're future inventions and we don't need to know how they work. But how the hell do you bore a 100 yard wide hole to the core of a planet? There's a reason planets are round, this hole would've filled in the second their ray gun stopped! Special effects were cool, but these days, all special effects are cool.<br/><br/>The biggest insult to my intelligence, though, was the military aspect of this show. Star Fleet is basically the navy in space, and a starship is the fleets capitol ship. Imagine a midshipman stowing away on an aircraft carrier, only to be named XO by the captain, ahead of many other seasoned officers already aboard ship. Yup, that happens. Saves The Federation, and is named Captain of the Enterprise with his handpicked crew of twenty year olds. Sure, you betcha. This is an insult to the intelligence to anyone who's ever served in the military, but wait... Oh, it's an alternate reality, not the same universe as the 'real' Star Trekkies, so it can be re-written however it pleases the non-military and non-scientific idiots who wrote and directed this steaming pile."
"PWNYCNY","4","16","26","9 May 2009"," What a circus! A sappy distortion of the original Star Trek story.
","Mr. Spock, where are you when we need you because you definitely are not in this movie. And as for Captain Kirk, a heroic if somewhat temperamental character has now been reduced to a mere caricature of a caricature, except this new caricature is so dumb that it baffles the mind as to how anyone could actually believe that such a dolt could be passed off as a hero. In this blotted version of Star Trek, the ship has been transformed into a glossy and poorly run whinery. Yes ... WHINERY ... that is a place where everyone whines. The complaining never stops. What do they want? They have good jobs, rank, authority, and are millions of light years away from headquarters and sanity. Their problem is that they pick a fight with a much stronger, tougher, smarter and better organized opponent who has a legitimate gripe against the Federation, particularly Mr. Spock who undergoes some kind of time warp schism that defies every known and probably every unknown law of physics, not to mention common sense. But what is even worse, the movie isn't even campy, it's just plain dumb. The USS Enterprise would not have last five seconds against the Alien or Predator. Darth Vader would have had a field day against Kirk and company. Ming the Merciless would have made short shrift out of the hapless crew from the Federation. Starship Troopers would have put the Enterprise in mothballs. <br/><br/>If a spacecraft is capable of demolishing a planet, then why would anyone believe that a starship could defeat that spacecraft? This movie defies all logic as it asks the audience to believe what is patently absurd, such as the Enterprise being able to destroy a planet killer or the scene in which Mr. Spock is having a conversation with himself. No, not talking to himself, rather talking WITH himself, the same person, two bodies. Move over Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The producers of Star Trek have discovered new laws of physics. This is not to suggest, however, that the movie is all bad. Far from from it. Although muddled, the story does move at a rapid pace, with lots of special effects, lots of noise, lots of fighting, with things blowing up, planets being sucked dry, some good dialogue, a solid performance by Zachary Quinto as Mister Spock (the younger), a stabilizing presence by Leonard Nimoy as Mister Spock (the older), and strong performance by Eric Bana as the bad guy, who, if this movie had a credible story, would have whipped Kirk and Spock's butts in about ten seconds (but then there would have been no movie). But the most yucky feature of this sappy distortion of the original Star Trek story is the love relationship between the half-human Mister Spock, who has a whole bunch of personal problems so acute that it would have even made the most insensitive dolt think twice before having anything to do with him, and Ms. Uhuru who looks and acts like a teenage girl. Ms. Uhuru: News Flash! Mister Spock is a wreck! Also, whatever happened to those vaunted shields that in the television show always protected the ship from harm? In this movie the shields are about as effective as paper-mache as the Enterprise is strafed, bombed, rocketed, smashed, tossed, toppled, and shaken like a baby's toy. Rarely, if ever, in the annals of Hollywood movies has a hero spaceship been more beat up. By any standard of movie story telling, the Enterprise should have ceased to exist. Indeed, the Enterprise should have disappeared after its very first encounter with the bad guy ship, so outclassed was it in terms of size, firepower and intelligence. And who could figure out exactly who was the Captain? There was constant bickering over who was in command. First Pike, then Spock, then Kirk, then back to Pike. What a circus! This movie was more reminiscent of McHale's Navy or F Troop. The Enterprise would have done better with Captain Parmenter, Sergeant O'Rourke and Corporal Agarn in command, or better yet, Captain Wally Binghamton and Ensign Charles Parker. Now THEY were the type of hapless Hollywood buffoons who would have fit in perfectly in this sfx-laden, pompous piece of celluloid which is called Star Trek.<br/><br/>An afterword: Two of the more annoying characters in this movie are Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scotty. It is highly doubtful that there are any two characters in any Hollywood movie that are more whiny and shrill-sounding than these two nincompoops. Now, in the TV series, these characters are temperamental but not stupid. However, this movie makes them temperamental AND stupid. They make the late Lou Costello sound like Clark Gable. In fact, this movie would have worked much better if the actual Bud and Lou had played Kirk and Spock.<br/><br/>In this movie, The Enterprise fighting the bad guy space ship would be like a badly sailed row boat going up against the largest aircraft carrier in the world, commanded by a crew of highly motivated, well-organized, merciless fanatics and bristling with planes, rockets and other highly lethal weapons, and the row boat not only winning but completely obliterating the aircraft carrier. Duh! ... Duh! ... DUH!!!!!!<br/><br/>Actually, this movie might have worked better if Spock and Kirk became the bad guys, playing disgruntled renegade Star Fleet officers who steal the Enterprise, convert it into a pirate ship and then try to shake down the entire Federation, threatening to destroy the universe with a secret, but unnamed, super weapon, that can make a real mess of everything. One other point: for a Vulcan, Spock is a disappointment. In this movie he is more skittish than a young teenage girl on the eve of her first prom with her first date. Spock, Kirk, Uhuru, the whole bunch of them, are so laughable that it gives one cause to believe that maybe this movie was supposed to be a comedy."

","I don't know if I can do a better or more succinct job of bagging this film than many others have done. Let me just briefly recap the most prominent shortcomings:<br/><br/><ul><li>a lame and clichéd script full of plot holes you could drive a truck through - dialogue cheesier than a dairy farm - plot contrivances galore - ridiculous action that was not required eg Kirk and ice friends on whatever M class planet they unrealistically jettisoned him on - attempts at humour that fell flatter than an IKEA box (to wit, the ridiculous 'Scotty in a tube' scene) - science fiction that jettisoned the science for fiction that was not even remotely believable (Kirk and Scotty somehow manage to beam from a crappy remote station onto a warp-travelling Enterprise at least several light years away - huh?)</li></ul><br/><br/>... and the list goes on. The actors were certainly capable, and as always with this type of film the sfx and technical detail was superb - a lot of people put in a lot of effort on this project. Unfortunately the script and directing was woeful and basically squandered the efforts of cast and crew.<br/><br/>This film confirmed for me the reputations these two writers are forging, as talentless hacks with nary a grasp of the subtleties of characterisation and action. And I'm not anti-Abrams - I'm a big fan of Lost - but here he is just another middle-aged man obsessed with loud explosions.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is like a house of cards - it collapses quickly and completely. As ridiculous plot contrivance piled onto the next (Kirk becoming captain in a jiffy; old Spock in an ice cave right where Kirk gets jettisoned etc etc) I just gave up.<br/><br/>I'm not a hard-core Trekker, but on the evidence of the message this film presents it might be prudent for all of us to top ourselves now and spare the universe our further evolution. We are not progressing as ST always posited. Rather, our future consists of brawling rebels and frat-boys-in-space.<br/><br/>The biggest concern for me is that this film, by far the 'dumbest' Trek film in terms of thoughtful presentation of the future, is also the most successful. Am I missing the point of the film, or do audiences prefer their swill served up in the loud and braindead fashion that we have here?"
"imdb-772-33473","1","9","13","23 June 2010"," Horrible storyline
","Casting and acting was well done, visual effects as well. Shaky camera in some scenes did not seem appropriate. But the story was just horrible and I don't understand how it got so many positive reviews.<br/><br/>I am not a big Star Trek fan so it's not like I am offended that they wiped the entire Star Trek history, even though that sucked too. Yeah, yeah, it's ""just"" an alternate universe, I get it. I could live with that. But the story is just a collage of things that are <br/><br/>a) original Star Trek history elements re-created even though this is an alternate universe in which Kirk's childhood along with many other things should be vastly different, and still he gets reunited with all of his original time-line pals, on Enterprise, of course...<br/><br/>b) completely unrealistic segments, like the whole sequence of ""oh look I stumbled upon the very cave on this deserted icy planet (very clean and breathable atmosphere by the way) that just happens to be inhabited by old Spock who will take me to an almost abandoned station which just happens to be the workplace of Scotty, and even though all of this had to take at least several hours, during which Enterprise was moving away as fast as possible, it will still be close enough for us to beam on it using this formula from the future"". Ugh.<br/><br/>c) completely unrealistic technology details. Red matter? Creates a black hole, but you have to put it in the center of the planet using an easily destroyable drill, but that's OK because among the billions of Vulcan and Human inhabitants none have any firearms to shoot it down. By the way, red matter can also be ignited by simply shooting lasers at it but hey the drilling thing was just too cool to skip.<br/><br/>d) clichés like the ""if they are not humanoid enough they are just for decoration"" aliens and of course the obligatory bar fight of cadets vs locals...<br/><br/>Overall a vast disappointment for me."

""Hold on there mate, if you eat that apple God will throw you two out of Eden, and he will curse all future descendants with something called 'Original Sin'.""<br/><br/>This probably wouldn't work .... for many reasons, mostly logical ones. For this movie logic is largely ignored, to a painful degree. Space fairing worlds already exist, and contact is only allowed if a planets civilisation become capable of interstellar travel at faster than light speed (warp drive abilities). <br/><br/>Apparently blowing up (or collapsing to a point) a developed planet of 6 billion beings only incurs a wrap over the knuckles with a wet teleport ticket. This is because the idiot (Eric Bana) is out for revenge for something that has not yet happened!!! Incredibly Eric Bana character (Nero) is TOLD this, and he still fails to see that as this is the past it literally has NOT happened! Think about it for a second.... if Earth is destroyed, and you find yourself back in time before it occurred: Would you seek revenge or try to prevent it?<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: After Vulcan is reduced, Spock says Vulcans are now an endangered species, yet the Vulcan people have been warping around the Galaxy for hundreds of years - have they never lived on any other world? Which is impossible as Romulans are descendants of Vulcan. (How ironic)<br/><br/>One more thing, well 2 actually: If you are caught falling into a black hole, give up - you can't escape based on the fact one can't go faster than light - oops!

"gigan-92","9","65","129","23 May 2011"," A Sci-Fi Classic By All Means
","I should start this by saying that I always leaned more toward Star Wars than Star Trek. I've memorized much of the Star Wars epic sci-fi fantasy and numerous characters, but the universe of Star Trek is one I have not really explored. The beauty of this film is that you can be a hard core Trek-fan or a simple lover of sci-fi or action and still find this an incredibly enjoyable movie. I myself was surprised when I first saw it, seeing all the relatable humor it was pouring out, but unlike the redundant idiocy of let's say Michael Bay, the jokes are welcome and don't go too far.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty well put together, and each character is pretty memorable and involved quite well. Eric Bana was excellent as Nero, not to mention Bruce Greenwood is awesome as well. Zachary Quinto is the beloved Spock and for one of those hyper-intelligent characters it's a character you will end up feeling emotionally drawn to. The story never drags at all and it's all together a pretty well written piece of sci-fi I must add. To be honest Chris pine is great in the movie, it's just that at times he too much of an archetype 'bad-ass', dare I say it? How many times have I seen a drunken protagonist in a bar starting a fight with a guy and/or trying to get a girl who views him as trash. Other than that, though, he does fine, and the rest of the cast is no less than good.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful on its own, let alone the action scenes. Speaking of which, a new bar for space battles has been set. And the score by Michael Giacchino and Alexander Courage was not too shabby. In fact I thoroughly embraced it. I consider it a must see, being one of those rare sci-fi gems anyone can enjoy."

Made a mistake? No problem, go back in time and correct it. Somebody ticked you off? Ditto, go back in time and make him pay. Need some Whales? Well, at least that was entertaining.

"baikal1","3","11","17","14 April 2010"," pretty awful
","Taken in isolation, this was a fairly decent, although forgettable, blockbuster flick. However, the movie was not sufficiently respectful of and faithful to the Star Trek universe of the preceding series and feature films. In its ""ultimate reset"" feature, the movie completely wipes out all the future history developed in the original Star Trek series, in STTNG, Deep Space 9, Voyager and all the previous feature Star Trek films. Granted, many of these previous productions were pretty bad and sometimes even nauseating (""Nemesis"" definitely comes to mind here). But, IMHO, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was, by and large, pretty good, as were quite a few of the feature films, like ""The Wrath of Khan"" and ""First Contact"". So now we are supposed to accept that all of that future has been simply wiped out? Sorry, but that just does not fly with me. J. J. Abrams should have been more respectful of the Star Trek tradition. As it is, I am sure that Gene Roddenberry is spinning in his grave in disgust at the mutilation that the Star Trek universe suffered in this film."

It was alright, I guess, but it kinda reminded me of that third Pirates of the Caribbean movie, where when something goes awry, don't worry about it because, bingo, the next scene will be a cheesy solution. Kirk gets exiled to the frozen tundra? No worries, Spock lives in the nearest cave--oh, I should say the original Spock lives there, not the young Spock at the wheel of the Enterprise who had just kicked Kirk off the ship. And it gets so much worse than that, script-wise. And I kinda empathized with ol' Nero and his misunderstanding of the cause of the destruction of his planet.

"hpmudbld","1","12","19","13 November 2009"," The worst part is that it didn't have to be this way.
","Honestly, if you told me that Michael Bay had written, directed, and/or produced this garbage, I wouldn't have been surprised. This movie was basically a two hour action cartoon (sorry for rating so low if you're into action cartoons), with well-known characters from the Star Trek series. I refer to movies like this as having ""porn"" plots, because the ridiculous and often nonsensical plot is only an excuse to show you the action. I'm going to just go ahead and outline my specific qualms with the movie point by point.<br/><br/>1. A time travel plot, really? Aside from being severely overused, having taken place so far back in star trek history, this plot rewrites basically all of Star Trek. Five series, ten movies, a cartoon, and countless video games, toys, comic books, novels, and conventions should have been clues to the makers of this movie that people liked Star Trek as it is. It might not have been such a big deal if there weren't MAJOR changes made to the time line that are going to affect the entirety of Star Trek from now on. As far as I can tell, making an alternate time line ONLY serves to alienate the main Star Trek fan base. The plot could have been virtually anything else, and still kept the die hard fans.<br/><br/>2. Characters were one-dimensional and untrue to their originals. I don't really know what to say, so I'll just rant. Kirk was unlikeable and just a stereotype. A bad boy loose cannon jerk who plays by his own rules, rides a motorcycle and gets into bar fights while taking advantage of women and displaying a clearly broken moral compass? Really? Kirk? Really? I mean Kirk was always known to bend the rules and kiss the girl, but in this movie, he's like an extreme version of the Fanz. And what's going on with Spock? He's the most emotional character in the movie. It doesn't make any sense at all. And a romantic subplot with Spock and Uhura? Lord have mercy! The only character that seemed to be even remotely based off the original (and incidentally, the only character I really liked) was McCoy. He was hilarious. I feel like JJ Abrams was just taking advantage of an existing franchise to make money :(<br/><br/>3. The movie had nothing to do with Star Trek. The plot is entirely interchangeable. If you had changed the names of all the characters and changed the names of their home planets, this could have easily been a Star Wars movie. Or a new sci-fi franchise altogether. If you paid close attention to all the star trek episodes and movies, you see that each plot is a moral play where the main characters either have to make a tough choice with big consequences, or they learn an important lesson. And the best part was that they never got too preachy about it. They also managed to balance science fiction with action, comedy, and sometimes a bit of romance. The point is that the plots were always at least a little complicated and well explained. It just didn't feel like a Star Trek movie at all.<br/><br/>4. Star Trek XI was an animated feature. Oh yeah. It's not listed as an animated feature on IMDb, but it is. Really, if more than 50% of a movie is rendered on a computer, it should be labeled as an animated feature like the Pixar movies. Don't get me wrong, everything looked really cool, but the qualification is that it all looked really cool for a cartoon. I have the same complaint with the new star wars trilogy and 90% of the new action movies. The original Star Wars came out in 1977, but the effects they used are still mind blowing by today's standards. There's one simple reason for this: It looks real. The use of models and real pyrotechnics puts you inside the movie, like if you reached through the silver screen, that exploding console would actually burn you. The use of animatronics is what gives fantasy creatures their believability. I don't think anyone complained that the aliens from the alien trilogy looked fake or weren't absolutely terrifying. So what's the deal? This movie obviously had an enormous special effects budget, so they should have used it to show the world what models and pyrotechnics and puppetry can do in 2009, instead of showing us the same old tired CGI that we see in every movie these days.<br/><br/>5. It didn't have to be this way. This movie clearly jump-started the franchise, but it also reinvented it. Also, it brought in a bunch of people who weren't previously Star Trek fans. But it also alienated a sizable portion of the existing fans. The saddest part is that the movie had the potential to both please original fans, restart the franchise without reinventing it, and bring in new fans. The biggest difference is that Star Trek XI had several times the budget of any previous Star Trek movie. This could have been a huge action movie without destroying the Star Trek time line, and even with keeping the characters more like they were. It could have been a regular old prequel. It seems like the reason that they used the alternate time line was just so they didn't have to keep it true to form. There was absolutely no reason that the franchise had to be ravaged like that. Star Trek Generations, for example, was made on a 35 million dollar budget and it grossed about 120 million (1994 dollars). I wonder what they could have done if they had four times the budget. Would it have been a good Star Trek movie, true to the original franchise, with awesome special effects and a new fan base? Well, with the precedent having been set for Star Trek to be nothing more and a CGI explosion love fest, I guess we'll never know."

Terrible Michael Giacchino music... as usual, he pours on the treacle during the (allegedly) ""quiet"" scenes.<br/><br/>And the one female character who gets any screen time (and isn't killed off) is Uhura, who has somehow become conflated with Nurse Chapel.

You've come a LONG way baby!) The scenes between her and Spock were beyond embarrassing, and I kept hoping the Enterprise would fall into a black hole at the end so that they would enter a different time stream and that whole ""history"" between them would be erased. Sadly, JJ Abrams decided not to arbitrarily use time travel for that. More's the pity.<br/><br/>I was unmoved by the extended Leonard Nimoy appearance (more than a cameo, and awkwardly so) and especially by the ""moving"" voice-over at the end... which was already done (much better) in STAR TREK II.<br/><br/>That said...<br/><br/>...the cast was EXCELLENT. You could not have hoped for a better Mr. Spock than Zach Quinto (the ONLY reason why I would ever consider seeing a second go-round of this Trek revival), Karl Urban was terrific (and under used) as McCoy, loved the guys playing Sulu and Chekhov (although again, why was Chekhov conflated with Wesley Crusher? UNNECESSARY!). Not as impressed with Chris Pine as Kirk but given the tiresome limitations of his character (wow, Kirk is arrogant, we GET it already) I suppose he did all right.<br/><br/>If only I could erase the memory of the transporter room scene with Spock and Uhura ...

His reboot is mere eye-bubblegum at best. Forgettable the minute it's over, nobody could discuss the plot at length just 1/2hr later.<br/><br/>At worst, it devolves Star Trek into a shinier ripoff of Star Wars, in a transparent attempt to appeal to the masses.<br/><br/>Once its predecessor ST-X:Nemesis(2002) broke the even-numbered-charm by losing money, Star Trek(2009)'s seven producers should've known better than to again invoke Romulan terrorism for a plot. Missing stronger plot ideas for Harve Bennett's prequel, they succumbed to repetition. Time-travel would conveniently acculturate the younger actors, so....we got what we got.<br/><br/>We quickly lose the plot because action dominates (the film is unbalanced); time-travel and ""red matter"" pragmatics are glossed-over for the novelty-seekers with no patience for science; the set-ups for location and discovery exposition are poor, eg when young Spock commandeers old Spock's ship or why old Spock unaccountably deals with ""red matter"" himself; we're unprepared for Spock's venal marooning of Kirk ACCIDENTALLY on the planet where old Spock is also marooned, or for old Spock's ridiculous sighting of Vulcan imploding; plus cadet Kirk gets promoted embarrassingly quickly to Captain.<br/><br/>Some discomforts are due to losses in editing, but not all. Beats like the marooning and the ""Centaurian slugs""(Ceti-Alpha eels) are carelessly borrowed from ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982); ""shiny"" elements are slathered on, as are all the imperceptibly-quick action scenes, matched by a deluge of unlikely success. Such pandering choices result in cinematic bubblegum, begun in the screenplay: according to ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982) young Kirk wasn't a loser bad-boy, just a Lothario ""crazy for space"". In ST(2009) he's been rewritten as having abilities we don't see, and hunky enough to induce Capt.Pike (Greenwood) to become his overawed benefactor.<br/><br/>Even worse, the severe dress uniforms, combined with the Iowa cop's Judge Dredd(1995)-look and ST-inappropriate attitude give Starfleet the feel of a fascist Death Star assembly.<br/><br/>Did Star Trek deserve this claptrap? <br/><br/>Abrams appears out of faith for the franchise, surreptitiously remaking it into Star Wars; but we can be equally angry at professional critics, whose job it was to pick such things up, and to consider that when fans ""smell horse-puckey, perhaps there's a pony in the barn"".<br/><br/>This screenplay was of course written with George.W in office, when the revenge-seeking terrorist must've seemed irresistible for geeing-up audiences. Although that plot device can be--and in ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982) ALREADY HAS BEEN--done well, its belaboring has also typically been at the root of several unpopular Star Trek movies. Abrams et al nevertheless felt the.....need to ramp-up audience dread with it, having the spouse-destructively stupid Nero (Bana, utterly wasted) riding a needle-fronted spaceship--a motif thoughtlessly stolen from ""Babylon-5""(TV), where it made sense.<br/><br/>Thievery ISN'T homage.<br/><br/>The dull score is forgettable, but irritating when its misplaced Chinese violin is found to be stolen from ""Firefly""(TV), to pull ""Browncoats"". Only the reworked ST:TOS end theme enhances/is enhanced by the nebulae and planetary visuals. The OPENING could've used that.<br/><br/>I've sat with 3 audiences seeing it for the first time now. Two failed to laugh at the paltry jokes; the only titter was raised by Uhura's ridiculous and unexpected smooching of the Vulcan. Clearly these were fans who didn't know what hit them. Uhura(Zoe Saldana)'s unexplained relationship with Spock--now rewritten as the sexier one--becomes unintentionally funny; had this been an organic wink at Nichelle Nichols' historic interracial kiss with Bill Shatner, we'd have been pleased.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg, too, creates a silly buffoon for Scotty that's nothing short of a ""crack in the Star Trek canon""(Scott Weinberg). It undercuts the kindly engineering geek that Jimmy Doohan spent decades crafting, revealing an uncaring disrespect for Roddenberry's vision itself.<br/><br/>Pegg's unwelcome postmodernist characterization adds another unwelcome flourish with a JarJar Binks-ripoff sidekick, who has no lines, but annoys both ""Scotty"", and us. This must be the filmmakers' failed rework of Gerrold's tribbles.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is missing gravitas--and screen time--as Spock's mother Amanda. Her death is unmissed, except by John Cho's Hikaru Sulu, whose powerful reaction shot isn't enough.<br/><br/>Only Zachary Quinto (Sylar from ""Heroes""(TV)) has imbued his performance with many of Nimoy's reticent nuances. Not surprisingly, Nimoy actually worked with him for weeks to achieve this, but it was the first honest work I could see in the film.<br/><br/>At least the writers knew the lore. I enjoyed their incorporation of Kirk's middle-name into his birth and that it was originally his Starfleet biological father who didn't ""believe in the no-win scenario""; as well as McCoy's acquisitions of his nickname and fear of transporters, etc. Lore maintenance is good, but its revamping goes wrong by imposing stolen elements purely for generic loser-appeal.<br/><br/>Scott Chambliss' wonderful production design for the Enterprise interiors deserves special mention. His plexiglass and flexible spot-lamps are brilliantly new while reminiscent of ST:TOS. However we could've lived without the heavy girders, plumbing, and the ridiculous smelt-works locations, which borrow too much from ST:Enterprise.<br/><br/>The third audience I sat with was the most animated, being an evening audience well-lubricated with champagne, but none of them had any exit opinions to offer either. Nobody clapped, like they had in 1982.<br/><br/>We have an obligation to compare ST(2009) with the Trek features high-water mark, especially because Nick Meyer's ST-II:The_Wrath_of_Khan(1982) was itself a (second filmic) reboot that snatched franchise victory from the jaws of defeat. Unfortunately Bad Robot's frenetic bad-faith pap serves up only a calculated and insulting, empty version of Star Trek to its hopeful/thoughtful fans. We wonder, will Abrams ""learn by doing""? <br/><br/>If this reboot garners newer generations AND future directors restore things to a less Fascist, truer Star Trek feel, then fine; otherwise all this action-ridden pap and ill-advised ""borrowing"".....won't have been worth it.(5/10)"

","There are several generations of Star-Trek fans out there and based on their refusal to 'Grow Up' will in all likelihood be more. Those of us who enjoy the original series and perhaps a couple of the movies, realize that despite all the effort to replicate the original dream, directors will never please everyone. This newest film entitled "" Star Trek "" is reasonably better than others in that the new cast is well selected. In this offering we have Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike, the original Captain of the Enterprise. (Superior selection.) Chris Pine plays the young James T. Kirk, who is full of vim, vigor and enthusiasm. Zachary Quinto plays the early Spock, full of expectation, promise and definitely logical for the role. Karl Urban plays the erasable Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy. It seems they select the right man as he fits reluctantly into his role. Simon Pegg plays engineer, Montgomery Scott well and believable and I believe, James Doohan would have agreed. John Cho is the youthful Lt. Hikaru Sulu, the pilot and portrays him very and observably masculine. One wonders why? The navigator is the very young Russian Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) Based on his performance, very believable. Then we have eye-candy Zoe Saldana as Communication's officer Nyota Uhura. Her 'brief tease' and wondrous appearance in this film is not only attractive, vivacious, but forcefully sexy. What is unexpected is her apparent love interest which will conjure up a bagful of mixed images in the sequel. After the introduction of Eric Bana as the heavy, Ben Cross as Sarek, we are further treated to special guest appearance by Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime. The film is loaded with magnificent action scenes, hurtling explosive crafts, photon blasts and violently exploding worlds. In addition, the inter-dimensional space-time travel and encounters with gigantic Black Holes will have the audience gasping and wanting more. Excellent film and a worthy addition to Gene Roddenberry's dream. ****"

"tedg","Null","29","55","23 May 2009"," Uncanny Valley
","In CGI circles, when they talk of artificial beings and reality, there is a phenomenon called the ""uncanny valley.""<br/><br/>The idea is simple. The closer you get to reality, say in a fake human, the more we are willing to believe it, until you get close. Then the graph of believability plummets until you have a human that is perfectly human. Almost real but not quite is the thing we least accept. Filmmakers know that if you fall into this uncanny valley, people will run away. ""Polar Express"" is often cited as an example, because if the people had been less people-like — perhaps as munchkins — we would have readily accepted it. Gollum seems real because he is not a person.<br/><br/>The whole Star Trek franchise is based on staying away from this valley. It was cheesy by accident at first, but then by design. The effects were obvious, the acting of a particular style. Staying away from all the normal production values make it resonate more clearly; we are fairly adept at filling in the gaps in things like this.<br/><br/>The one thing that they migrated to as the thing we were to accept as truly real and accepted as real was the spaceship. As the films evolved, this became more and more of the distraction. It was on the real side of that valley, allowing us to pull everything else on the other side over in our imaginations.<br/><br/>But here, this new guy gets the formula all mixed up. This is not Star Trek, but an ordinary action movie with Star Trek allusions — and the same ship.<br/><br/>Sure, the thing is expertly delivered, and the time travel tricks are interesting enough to keep us engaged. But the actual story is too close to being real. It tries too hard to matter, instead of being a Trek Fable. So it falls into this uncanny valley, this black hole of near reality.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"davidsawyer-me","2","7","10","9 July 2012"," I wanted to like it but hatted it. I walked out.
","I actually walked out during the last 15 minutes of this movie. I thought it was full of reworked cliché's and nothing all that unique. I understand that it's about their past and all but still it was like watching a bunch of old used up premises fused together with duck tape. I also didn't like some of the actor choices, the dialog was cheesy, and the CGI was way too busy. It was more smoke and mirrors than actual content. I'm not saying it was the worst movie ever but the Star Trek franchise seems to be dying of late. Specially after that TV series simply called Enterprise. What a sink fest that was. Anyway, the movie was flashy and had lots of action but it really couldn't hold my attention because there was no real depth or purpose to it. It was all frosting and no cake. I also don't like how they don't keep with the original styles from the past but rather use newer props yet explain the discrepancy as a matter of ""style choice"" in the past which just doesn't fly. It's like they aren't even trying anymore to have any real continuity. I guess they think stringing cliché' premises and reworked scenes equates somehow to what they perceive as continuity. They cared far more about CGI esthetics than depth and content. By the end I was bored and two of my friends had already walked out. I didn't follow them because I wanted to give this movie a chance. But eventually I had to leave even though there was like 15 to 20 minutes left. One of my friends was outside smoking a cigarette and I laughed thinking ""hmmm this guy found a cigarette more interesting than this movie"". ha ha ha Hollywood ha gotten so bad over the years. Everything they crank out is just one big CGI movie and it looks rather like a glorified cartoon full of action rather than any real acting or props. It's all rather pretty but it gets boring after a while. Like I said it's all frosting and you can only eat so much frosting before you get sick."

The shaky camera work and lens flares will give you a headache within the first minute of this travesty.

I read that Paramount recently axed their studio execs, and now I know why (at least I HOPE the reason was because it was they who handed the reins of this franchise to a talentless hack like JJ Abrams who cares nothing for art and everything for the almighty dollar).

The beginning wasn't bad but then the complete disregard for the laws of physics (I'm not talking about things like warp drive but the plausibility of some of the stunts) and the irresponsible way that Star Fleet was run really ruined it for me. The plot was pretty standard though I can't really understand why the bad guys were so upset to begin with<br/><br/>There were no revelations or subtle plot twists in fact the entire movie hits you over the head so hard that I got a headache watching all the special effects and wondering who would believe them.<br/><br/>In short, while I love the original series and most of the recent TV and movies, I doubt I'll have any urge to watch this again.

"jones_thom","10","9","14","11 July 2011"," Brilliant and entertaining.
","I want to start off by saying that the negative reviews of this film all focus on one thing, it's predictability and far-fetched plot. THAT is what Star Trek is all about, you cannot have a film set in the future about an advanced human race saving the galaxy without some cliché characters and obvious plot choices, and yet, this film is not that predictable when you realise the good guys always win in Star Trek, so it was obvious Kirk was going to Captain the Enterprise and save the day, if you don't like that or think it's un-original why bother watching a film with ""Star Trek"" as its title?!?!?! Right, onto the film: It looked magnificent, the special effects and attention to detail were phenomenal, I can tell you, when I watched this in the cinema I couldn't dream of anything more than actually being in one of them space ships, and who doesn't when they look as gorgeous as they do in Star Trek, it was colourful and dark in all the right places, the colours in the environment complimented the particular scenes mood, peril, excitement, desperation, it clawed you in and you just have no choice but to be devoured by it all.<br/><br/>Chris Pine does an excellent job of portraying Kirk, the cocky-yet-genius attitude was brilliant, the humour and seriousness factor he brings to the role was fantastic, I don't think they could have picked a finer actor! Quinto as Spock was also brilliant, he played the role as Spock was convincingly that you can't help but be impressed by his overall intellect and his cold, calculated logic, and very sympathetic for him when he finally gets a grip of his emotions, he is the perfect counter for Pine and can't wait to see him in the sequel(s) Karl Urban as Bones, was just awesome, sarcastic and cynical, just as I remember him, another perfect companion for Kirk! Simon Pegg as Scotty, my God, a match made in heaven, Pegg brought such humour to this role it was a brilliant surprise, an unusual role for Pegg but done perfectly with a mixture of humour and intelligence and sheer eccentricity, a fine addition to the cast.<br/><br/>Eric Bana as Nero, a very convincing villain, brilliantly acted as a stubborn, merciless, cold, hurt Romulan who just wants closure in the only way he knows: Violence, shame to see him go from the cast in fact! All in all, this film is a work of art, visually, acting and scripting, the cameo role from Nimoy was brilliant, just what the film needed, could it of needed Shatner? No, I don't think so, not in this film, Nimoy fitted in because the script could fit around him, Shatner had no role in this film, maybe in the sequels! The film has set the bench mark for future sci-fi films, especially for such a huge franchise such as Star Trek, JJ Abrams deserves a model for this, and it's a film I can still watch on DVD and not be bored, very well done.<br/><br/>10/10."

","This movie didn't do much for me. It seemed like it was so wrapped up in the novelty of the characters' previous lives and the slapstick of them uttering familiar phrases for the first time that it strayed from the path of something meaningful. <br/><br/>That's not to say that it had to be profound, but that's what the original series was all about. <br/><br/>I also thought the original series stressed the importance of peace; at the end of this flick, the crew joyfully engages in bloodlust. <br/><br/>In the action scenes, as is the modern style, once again we're treated to a manic roving camera that's so all over the place that it's hard to tell what's really happening. Instead of the camera telling a story, we're assaulted with hard-to-follow action that leaves us limp and uninformed. <br/><br/>This is just my opinion, of course. Not being well versed in Trekdom, I know that the real fans are getting more out of it than I did. Some of the more obvious humor was enjoyable, and I bet the movie is loaded with in-jokes for the true devotees. <br/><br/>But so many people I know have been singing the movie's praises.

The film's unnecessarily complex and confusing time-travel story is riddled with irritating contrivances and plot-holes big enough to fly a Romulan mining craft through, while the rapid editing and an over-reliance on 'everything-including-the kitchen sink' CGI effects only add to the chaos.<br/><br/>If this is the standard of film-making we are expected to endure, I can only hope that this rebooted franchise will not 'live long and prosper'."

As a generic fiction action action movie this gets 10 out of 10 from me. So why do I only vote it 5 out of 10? Because I'm a Trekkie, have been since I first tuned in to The Original Series as a wide eyed six year old. I would like to give it 0 out of 10 as a Trekkie because I take personal exception to the destruction of the planet Vulcan.<br/><br/>Science fiction is a useful genre for flexibly describing our world as it is, for discussing issues of our time. If Mr Spock and Vulcan symbolised anything during the optimistic '60s, it was the triumph of reason over superstition and religious dogma, and as such, it has always been an important reason why I have been a Trekkie.<br/><br/>I wonder why the writers of this movie destroyed Vulcan. Is it perhaps because the world has moved on such a long way since the 1960s and the human race is now rejecting scientific humanism in favour of a return to religious dogma and superstition? Religious fundamentalism has been on the rise now for quite some time in most of the world from China to America. Only Western Europe, Canada and Australia remain as a refuge for reason in a fatuous world. If that is the reason for Vulcan's destruction, then I guess that is acceptable. However if the writer's did this merely for exploitative shock value then that is lazy and banal IMHO."

","Warning! Spoilers!<br/><br/>I want to state that I've seen some of the original series shows and movies. I enjoyed ""Wrath of Khan"" and the whale movie. I'm even familiar with some of the features of the series, such as Vulcan ""pon farr"" and the Kobayashi Maru simulation. That said, this movie is a passable contribution to the ""Star Trel"" franchise.<br/><br/>This movie follows in the tradition of ""rebooting,"" or re-doing, a franchise from the beginning. It has been done with Batman and Superman. The results for ""Star Trek"" may leave a bitter taste in Trekkie's mouths. Planet Vulcan is destroyed, as is Spock's mom. Cadets at Starfleet are shoved into officer positions because of the emergency involving a mad Romulan. Uhura has the hots for Spock, and the feeling is mutual. Kirk is a pretty model torn straight from the fashion magazines (not even young Shatner was this pretty!) and is an arrogant, smug, disobedient lothario who seems ill-suited for the captaincy of a garbage scow. It's certainly not something I'd imagine die-hard Trekkies could even appreciate. <br/><br/>That said, the movie serves mainly as a nostalgic pastiche of the original series and movies, and offers little in the way of any new or engaging plot. It's sort of a mix of tongue-in-cheek parody and shoot-en-up CGI sci-fi light show. Some characters are exaggerated versions of the originals: Dr. McCoy is little more than a turbo-charged parody of DeForrest Kelley's original, and Chekov's Russian accent is virtually unintelligible. There are constant references to the series, meant to bring a warm and toasty feeling to Trekkies who otherwise might feel insulted by this mediocre effort: there are horny Orion slave girls(Natasha Lyonne? Well, it looked like her), Kirk's cheat of the Kobayashi Maru, and a mind-control worm identical to the Seti Eel. It's all in good fun, but don't expect great writing or anything really original. It's nothing more than a walk down memory lane with CGI. As a parody, ""Galaxy Quest"" did it better. <br/><br/>Lastly, I think the beautiful Winona Ryder is still too young to play anyone's mother! Guys with a crush on Winona might be dumbstruck that she's playing an old lady (her son played by an actor six years her junior, no less)."
"quarterwavevertical","1","10","16","23 November 2019"," Was This Supposed To Be A Spoof?
","Reboots of movies or TV shows are generally not a good idea. One example is ""Battlestar Galactica"" from about 15 years ago. It started off well, but, after its second season, the plot turned silly and the series became a parody of itself.<br/><br/>""Star Trek"" is another. The viewer is required to abandon all previous knowledge of the original series and the movies based on it, but the result is no improvement.<br/><br/>For example, the plot suffers from lazy writing. Rather than maintaining all the details from the original series, many of them are either ignored or written out all together. Conveniently, the planet Vulcan is destroyed and the writers no longer have to worry about the relationship between Spock and his parents. (This was similar to the destruction of Gallifrey in the current version of ""Doctor Who"". Why worry about the conflict between the Doctor and the other Time Lords when their home is no longer part of the plot?)<br/><br/>And, when all else fails, bring in a future version of a certain character as a plot device. Leonard Nimoy's Spock, unfortunately, was completely out of place.<br/><br/>The main characters are poorly written as well. The young Kirk is little more than an ill-disciplined, brawling hooligan who doesn't know how to obey orders, possessing an inflated self-worth. The original Uhura was from southern Africa and had a dignified manner, making one wonder if she didn't have a royal ancestry. The Uhura in this movie was completely undignified and of dubious virtue. As for Spock, the less said the better. Emotionally conflicted? How about simply lacking in self-discipline and self-restraint?<br/><br/>The original Chekov first appeared during the second season of the series and was introduced because of Beatlemania. He became a pivotal character in a number of episodes as well as the movies. The one in ""Star Trek"" is little more than a high school boy who would be more at home playing video games than serving on board a starship. The Sulu in this movie isn't much better. There's no indication that he had an interest in botany or that he had the potential for a future command.<br/><br/>As much as I liked Bruce Greenwood's portrayal of American President John F. Kennedy in ""Thirteen Days"", his Captain Pike falls short of Jeffrey Hunter's from the original pilot episode ""The Cage"". Speaking of which, in that show, the Enterprise had a tough-as-nails First Officer (played by Majel Barrett and simply referred to as ""Number One""). Were the writers of ""Star Trek"" worried about having a strong female character of high rank on the bridge?<br/><br/>I've never served in the military, but from what I know of it, many of those same characters would be subject for courts-martial because of their conduct, or would that no longer apply in the 23rd century?<br/><br/>If I didn't know any better, I would swear that ""Star Trek"" was intended to be a spoof, but I have to keep reminding myself that this was intended to be a serious movie. To be honest, I found the ""Star Wreck"" send-ups to be more entertaining.<br/><br/>Avoid this rubbish like the plague."

It's a film that's been endlessly hyped since it was released, so I figured it really did have to be THAT good.<br/><br/>Errwas everyone else watching a different film? This is a middling Star Trek film, nothing more. It's mildly entertaining as you watch it, but quickly forgettable afterwards. The storyline is of the usual bad-guy-wants-to-destroy-the-world type guff, adding in some bits of time travel here and there in an attempt to try and make it seem more original than it really is. I've seen this exact same stuff play out over and over again and STAR TREK fails to bring anything new to the table.<br/><br/>Okay, the special effects are fantastic. The film's a winner on that point alone. But special effects don't make a good film on their own. What about action scenes? There aren't really any to mention, aside from one memorable sky-diving interlude. Decent characters? I'm afraid not. Eric Bana, hidden beneath tattoos and makeup, couldn't be a blander villain. Strong acting, right? Not really. Zachary Quinto is an exception as the new Spock, but cocky Chris Pine just left me cold and Karl Urban barely gets a look in. No surprise that it takes an old hand like Nimoy to show them how it's done.<br/><br/>Origin stories always feel long-winded and overly worthy to me. The stuff about how flawed characters can turn their lives around and do something good is so clichéd. The real challenge would be to just get on with the storytelling and show us the characters by their actions, instead of shoving their personalities down our throats for the entire first hour.<br/><br/>Turns out that MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III is still Abrams's best film as director by a long shot and this is nowhere near as much fun as STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT."

A ridiculous pointless back story for Kirk and Spock about them being wild crazy kids does nuthin but cheapen the original characters. It would be forgiven if the film delivered but the story was bad. I not sure exactly what happened- time travel element was needless, the red-blood material thingy was just stuck in from nowhere, scenes like the one on the frozen planet were just an excuse to show some action ending in coincidence that was just too far fetched. This must have been made for 12 year olds as no adult could have found anything to watch in it- except for the length of Uhuru's skirt. The writers have a lot to answer for- in the DVD extras in an interview with them they say they wanted it to be more like star wars.

","As an old trekkie, I had to go see this. Now I want the wasted two hours of my life back. <br/><br/>The movie is pretty much what I should have expected from J.J.Abrams. In ""Alias"" he demonstrated that he doesn't care whether a plot development is implausible, absurd, or just plain stupid, just as long as it moves the plot forward in flashy and dramatic way. In order to ""re-imagine"" the entire Star Trek franchise without pissing off nitpicking trekkies, Abrams has invented a clumsy time-travel branching-reality premise that gives him license to re-invent everything. In the process, all the thoughtful storytelling has been replaced by brainless, noisy action (the sound effects people seem particularly proud of a really nasty ""bang"" effect) accompanied by mayhem and melodrama that's almost pornographic. (Near the beginning, a screaming woman is sucked into the vacuum of space, while a key character is born under the most corny circumstances possible.) Worst of all, the key relationship of the original TV show -- two-fisted Kirk, sternly logical Spock, passionate McCoy -- has been replaced by a trio of one-dimensional action heroes. Kirk is now a brainless, wise-cracking delinquent who ends up in command of a starship through plot developments that Ed Wood would shake his head at. Spock is now a neurotic dweeb who occasionally spouts vulcanish clichés. And McCoy has been demoted to miscellaneous sidekick, replaced by Uhura, whose main role in this trio is to turn it into a love triangle! <br/><br/>On the bright side, I'm finally, *finally* over the cancellation of a certain TV series!"

Corporatons and marketing have nothing to do in Star Trek, they have no place in the vision of the future of humanity Star Trek offered. Abrams has Lucasfied Star Trek, but without the powerful storytelling Lucas has, so we just got a blockbuster with no heart, no imagination, and no vision. We are not going boldly where no man has gone before with this one. To quote another fan of Star Trek, let's just call this what it really is, ""Star Trek XI - Transformers the Movie"".

The plot is kind of cheap, there are events that just don't happen, not with real world physics and not with the extended laws of physics in Startrek. You just sit in the cinema and think ""man, thats kind of cheap/convenient/whatever"". Every minute you see stuff that is not canonical, and that is not even explained by the alternate timeline plot.

Star Trek TOS was about virtue, being good, doing the right thing, being level headed, etc. This so called 'star trek' is about throwing tantrums to get what you want, using people, having mood swings, etc. TOTAL OPPOSITE.<br/><br/>The sad fact of the matter is that Star Trek fans LOVE this fandom. And because of this love they will see just about anything ST related. That was the problem. JJ and co took advantage of this.

Let's focus on getting in the non-ST fans to make lots of $$$.""<br/><br/>So what SciFic franchise do most ppl like? Star WARS. So they made it like that.

The problem is that it pretends to be something it's not.<br/><br/>In TOS there was like 5 sec of action then 30 min of discussion. Nu!trek is more like 1hr 45min of action and 10 min of dialogue. What happened to the intelligent discussions? Gone, replaced by yelling and more action.

Make no sense....<br/><br/>Also the writers, and majority of the actors were not ST fans. Only Karl Urban was, and he CLEARLY gave the best performance with what little scenes he had. Since he knew what ST was ABOUT. The writers just sat down watched the 1st aired ep of ST TOS and were like 'Boom, we'll do that!' In that ep, Uhura sort of flirted with Spock.

How Could The Character Pavel Chekov be younger than in the same time period in the original timeline? Secondly.. Granted Spock was thrown back in time and was a part of creating the alternative timeline.. not the first time this has happened now is it? What caused Spock to finally give up on returning to his own time, or repairing the damage before the time line was altered? How will all this effect other story lines from the original Star Trek timeline, such as Data's head being left in 1897, Khan being frozen in 1999? Voyager 6 (VGER) heading to earth to find it's creator (which shouldn't have changed)? and of course, lets not forget there's a probe out there heading for earth to figure out why it lost contact with humped back whales! All of these started out before the timeline change, and apparently, slipped the minds of the writers and producers, causing me personally to only half like this Star Trek reboot.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the photography and acting was spot on, and the sound effects certainly surpass anything previously used in the Star Trek franchise.

","First off, I thought Chris Pine did a great job as Kirk. He seemed to be channeling Shatner's Kirk (in a good way) with a really visceral physicality. That being said...as a reboot this destroys virtually the entire back-history of the series (except for Enterprise which predates it). I know this is an ALTERNATE history, but this isn't an adequate excuse for the mush the critics seem to love. I found the camera work impossible to follow and extremely jarring. The plot made absolutely no sense. OK the Romulans are P****d off at Spock for not being able to save their planet, but instead of getting hold of the time travel device to SAVE their world they go off on a revenge binge...come on. How stupid are these people? Shouldn't they now be able to change history and PREVENT the disaster in the first place? The whole Spock and Kirk in conflict just did not ring true. Spock loses his temper and orders Kirk thrown off the ship? Just weird. Can you imagine this happening in a military command today? Thrown in the brig yes, but OFF THE SHIP??? NUTS. While I don't mind stretching the science aspect once in a while to make the plot work, transporting across interstellar distances was impossible in the Star Trek universe 100 years later. So Scotty can on the fly just pop them into the Enterprise engine room? I'm a big Simon Pegg fan, and I liked him as Scotty, but the script he was given just didn't work for the character. I can say the same for all the other characters. They just did not come alive for me the way they did in the original series. McCoy already had his quirks, all the catchphrases were duly said, but it was rather empty. My final and biggest complaint is how can you wipe out the Vulcans? One of the most popular races in the ST universe. I might have been able to forgive this reboot if they had simply not done this one thing. The writers had to have one REALLY BIG difference between this and the original, so they decide to blow up Vulcan...DUMB. I have no intention of bothering with any more movies in this rebooted series. I'm sure they will make money with the new fans who never watched the original, but I'm willing to bet they lost a bunch of us TOS fans...not that the producers care I'm sure."

","** Spoiler Alert ** I went to this movie wanting to enjoy it and trying to keep an open mind. I expected certain things and I felt cheated about 15 minutes into the movie. I kept waiting for the two things that would, I guess, comfort most Trekkies The musical theme and the simple soliloquy; Space, the final frontier You don't get it till the end of the movie, probably thrown in for safety's sake to ""nod"" to the Trekkies. I found that odd that a ""reboot"" would change something so basic, so familiar to the brand of ""Star Trek"". (The comparison came to mind of a popular soft-drink company wanting to reboot their 99 year-old drink recipe – and it didn't go well for them.) The musical theme is important to the brand. So is the history, for it to deserve the same label. I can't decide if this was a reboot, remake, or a new marketing campaign. Star Wars, Superman, Halloween, Mission Impossible, Pink Panther – all old movies, but you hear the music in your head. In Star Wars you knew in the opening title you would have the yellow text scrolling. In Superman that title score just grabs you But in the NEW Star Trek?? Prepare to embrace the fad of newness.<br/><br/>I heard great things about the musical score too – But it didn't happen for me. No familiar themes, not even a hint of a familiar dissonance associated with the scenes on planet Vulcan. The score was simply forgettable.<br/><br/>Cheated is the best description I can come up with. My sixteen year-old agreed that certain scenes were almost carbon copies of Star Wars. The giant bugs? – Starship Troopers. The ice planet Hoth?? Scotty's assistant was a Jar-Jar Binks/Oompa Loompa. My eleven year-old compared Nero to a Sith Lord. Why not just include light sabers while we're at it? Special effects the warp fx were rebooted, the transporter beam too – They both seemed comical to me. Nero at one point can jump 30 feet high Not to mention three heroes ""space jump"" complete with parachutes from orbit, instead of simply taking a shuttle craft..?? Time Travel? Really? Without including something to fix?? That's just lazy.<br/><br/>I'm sort of surprised that Leonard Nimoy appeared in it too. I'm sure it is just a funny old-geezer joke to some and a respectful nod to others, but I just see it as shrewd marketing move by the studio to appease a loyal fan-base they have (at times) seriously underestimated.<br/><br/>This was a good movie as compared to ""Starship Troopers"". It was probably better than ""The Core"" too. I went expecting to be engaged and drawn in to a drama, and I felt cheated. I expected the plot to have depth, I was disappointed. I expected that young Kirk would be a rebel, not a shallow juvenile plot device. I expected the same attention to detail that appears in the Lost series, but I guess it's just Star Trek Classic – We are just supposed to like it cause it's better.<br/><br/>I think that a lot of people really didn't understand Star Trek TOS at the time it came out. It was really cutting-edge social commentary hidden in a 1968 ""new-age"" sci fi. Times have changed and this movie will be accepted like as a fad for a new group to jump on the bandwagon. They don't have to understand sci-fi, the writers don't have to do social commentary. Just make something ""old"" NEW again, add special effects, some explosions and put it in a bright shiny package.<br/><br/>Time will tell. Who knows, maybe this will spark a ""reboot"" for Star Wars"

I've noticed the praise that has been lavished on the movie, both on Rottentomatoes.com and here in the IMDb.com user comments, but that does not change my perspective in the least.<br/><br/>After giving ""Star Trek"" a repeat viewing today (Friday was my first time), I can perceive that the talented JJ Abrams has now attempted to dumb down the Trek film franchise to a more conventional space action/adventure level. In essence, the special and unique qualities of Kirk, Spock and the other classic characters have been forfeited so they all can serve a script which is in the same fight/chase/shoot-'em-up popcorn category as ""The Matrix,"" ""Spider- Man,"" and yes, ""Mission: Impossible"" -- all of which were big money-makers because they delivered mindless entertainment.<br/><br/>Trek, for me, has been at its best when it gives MIND candy -- as opposed (or in addition) to EYE candy. Kirk and Spock could face a moral dilemma or they could tackle a space problem while their subsequent adventure gave us viewers intellectual ideas to chew on, and mind fodder that stayed with us long after we exited the theater/TV room.<br/><br/>In this new movie, we are treated to a storyline that features a vicious Romulan from the future named Nero bent on revenge. So, he travels back in time to try and destroy the planet Vulcan (and later, he targets Earth as well) with his evil, powerful ""red matter"" weapon that he stole from the Vulcans.<br/><br/>Such a kiddie-oriented, cartoonish plot is -- in my opinion -- more suited to an episode of ""Lost in Space"" than the thoughtful moral fabric of the Trek universe. And I believe the element of time travel in the movie serves to underscore how hackneyed and clichéd the story really is; we've seen time travel in Trek so many times that I'd be ready to call this movie ""Back to the Future, Trek Redux 100.""<br/><br/>As James T. Kirk, Chris Pine tries his best to portray an engaging, larger-than-life young captain-in-the-making but instead, Kirk comes off as a cocky, loud-mouthed egomaniac in this movie. The iconic William Shatner made Kirk an icon with equal components of dashing heroism and introspective self-doubt.<br/><br/>Pine's Kirk, however, is a simplistic, cardboard caricature that alternates between irritating moments of smugness (grinning while he eats an apple because he'll pass an academy test -- one in which he cheated to win) and shrill moments when he is battling and yelling at his chief nemesis, Spock. As scripted by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, Kirk has none of the charisma or personal conflict that embodies the very soul of our favorite starship captain.<br/><br/>Spock, as embodied by Zachary Quinto, may be even more ineffective. I found Quinto's line reading to be expressionless, flavorless and flat. Granted, Quinto is trying to personify an emotionless Vulcan, but to me, he's little more than a mannequin whose stiffness makes Spock a yawn-inducing presence and a thoroughly unlikable version of the fresh and believable innovation personified for so long by Leonard Nimoy.<br/><br/>To serve this story, Spock is called upon to arbitrarily throw Kirk off the Enterprise in an escape pod (just because Kirk beat up two security guards), make out with his fellow bridge officer Lt. Uhura in the turbolift (seems she had Ponn Farr pills to trigger Vulcan liplock techniques), as well as yell, scream and use violence while responding to Kirk's attempts to make him angry. Such moments further suggest to me that Orci, Kurtzman and Abrams mostly cared about ""packaging"" Star Trek (AND Spock) into an action yarn that suited their version of a money-making machine that would satisfy non-Trekkers ... NOT the people who have adored Spock for nearly 40 years (as I have).<br/><br/>This conventionalization of the Star Trek universe is also evidenced in the movie's fight scenes, which, to me, are headache-inducing and edited to be nothing more than a fast- moving blur. When Kirk and Sulu parachute down to take out an enemy ""drill"" on the planet Vulcan, a couple of Romulan thugs come out to welcome them and give us a few sword- fighting/fist-cuffing mighty blows for our heroic Kirk/Sulu action tandem. Unfortunately, the sequence, for me, showed a chaotic mix of jumbled camera angles, all of which negated the sense of personal combat intended for the audience.<br/><br/>Nimoy himself may be symbolic of this entire enterprise (pun intended). At the prunish age of 77 (his age during principal photography), Nimoy returns as Spock once again in a supporting capacity. Only this time, Nimoy's too-old Spock looks (and sounds) more like the personification of walking death with defective Vulcan dentures and practically shows how the filmmakers are trying to tell us what the ""old"" Star Trek represents in modern times: it's dying, it's outmoded and it's time to reboot it with a NEW approach and NEW ideas.<br/><br/>Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman do just that with high production values, convincing optical effects, flashy alien sets as well as the hunkier versions of our familiar Trek heroes. But the movie cannot win in the areas of character, intelligence and heart, the items which mean so much to me. This movie may break some box office records and may lead to a couple of sequels, but it cannot convince me that Trek — REAL Trek — is dead, gone and soon to be forgotten.<br/><br/>Thanks, guys, for killing Star Trek under the guise of ""reviving"" Star Trek."
"ravenwood62","1","15","27","22 October 2009"," Set phasers on ""Stupid!""
","Awful movie! Simply awful! ""Star Trek XI"" has got to be the poorest excuse for a ""Star Trek"" film yet! JJ Abrams should leave directing motion pictures to people who know what they are doing and stick to producing TV shows!(""Fringe"" has proved to be an excellent series!) He should especially stay out Gene Roddenberry's universe! Bad story, bad plot, bad direction, bad cinematography. Just a bad movie. Abrams has admitted he was always more a ""Star Wars"" fan than a Trekker, so what has he done? Abrams, along with writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman have managed to take our beloved ""Star Trek"" franchise and turn it into ""Star Wars 90210!"" The shaky hand held camera technique (ala' ""Cloverfield!"") of cinematography and harsh ""lens flares"" in every scene nauseated me to the point of actually walking out on this movie and demanding my money back! Leonard Nimoy's small part couldn't even help this confused, ill conceived turkey! Bottom line: This was a bad science fiction film that simply contained elements of ""Star Trek."" That's where the similarities end."

","I'm a huge Star Trek fan, especially the Next Generation TV Series with it's deep likable characters, clever plots & genuinely interesting dialogue but this film has very little to do with the TV series. It's just another big budget action film wearing Star Trek costumes where you are treated to one cliffhanger moment after another ad nauseum until you really don't give a monkeys about what certain death situation our 'heroes' will escape from next. All big explosions accompanied by the usual loud irritating music score relegates this Star Trek themed movie to the ever increasing list of forgettable action movies."
"Navaros","1","15","27","24 May 2009"," A few good points, but mostly ruined by SHAKYCAM, no plot, no meaning, a one-dimensional caricature villain, trashy smut, and being VASTLY INFERIOR to both TOS and DS9.
","Star Trek pretends to be the first film of its kind, but really it is the eleventh Star Trek film.<br/><br/>Star Trek is much better than all of the TNG (The Next Generation) films, and the TNG television series, put together. Star Trek has put more character development in its two hours than TNG had in its seven years on television and an additional four TNG films. However, that is not saying much, because that series and those films are all terrible, so improving on them ISN'T an accomplishment.<br/><br/>Star Trek is likewise much better than the shows Voyager, and Enterprise (the horrible non-Trek show that wanted to be a Trek show, and got canceled very quickly for being a piece of crap). However, that too, is not saying much.<br/><br/>When compared to the original Star Trek of the 1960's (TOS), or Deep Space Nine (DS9), Abrams' Star Trek falls flat on its face and bleeds its green blood all over the rocks.<br/><br/>Star Trek tries to remake TOS and on some levels it succeeds. Star Trek has restored the conflict and humor between the crew members, and adventure; vital concepts that made TOS special, but were subsequently murdered in TNG because by that time Roddenberry was a senile man close to death and therefore got the crazy idea in his demented, aged mind that having a show with no humor, no adventure, and no conflict would be good. Since he was calling the shots, his demented mind dictated for much smarter men in his employ to degrade themselves to his (insane, senile) vision and thus we got approximately twenty years of garbage Trek (TNG, Voyager, and Enterprise if you want to even call that abomination Trek, which it isn't).<br/><br/>However, there was also a shining beacon of brilliant Trek in that twenty years: DS9. After Season 1 of DS9, the makers of that show realized that you CANNOT write good drama with no humor, no adventure and no conflict. Therefore, they (rightfully!) flipped the bird to senile Gene's insane vision and instead restored TOS' amazing vision to Trek. Like TOS, DS9 had conflict; adventure; humor; compelling non-generic characters; tons of master actors and brilliant, epic stories.<br/><br/>Although Star Trek has likewise restored the conflict, adventure and humor of TOS, it left out one of the core aspects of TOS and DS9: intelligent, thought-provoking, meaningful stories. Star Trek has a generic plot (full of holes, at that), a generic one-dimensional caricature of a villain, and is overall, very dumb. No intelligence is required of the audience to understand Star Trek, nor is there any meaning to it. That is, it is dumbed-down for lowest common denominator (LCD) appeal. Whilst that is great for ticket sales because everyone, no matter how dumb, will buy a ticket, since seeing this movie will make them feel smart, it is very detrimental towards making a great film.<br/><br/>Additionally, Star Trek's great special effects by ILM are totally ruined by Abrams' amateur director SHAKYCAM usage. It is mind boggling that directors who are not wise enough to AVOID SHAKYCAM are allowed to direct huge mainstream movies like this. They should be forced to go back to film school for another ten years first, or however long it takes them to realize that only idiots think shakycam is a good thing, much less use it in their films. The shakycam makes Star Trek annoying and frustrating to watch. You can't see most of what's going on...instead all you see is the camera shaking like the director is a spastic test lab monkey with a few too many experimental injections running through his system.<br/><br/>TOS was groundbreaking by being one of the first television shows ever to feature, in Uhura, a strong Black woman as a main character. However, Star Trek completely bastardizes this point by turning Uhura into U-WHORE-A in this movie. U-WHORE-A spends all her time being pretty and lusting in her duties to be a sex slave to Spock and others. No reason is given for why U-WHORE-A has become a whore, nor for why Spock is using her as his sex slave. Not only does this bastardize the character of Uhura, but also that of Spock. Spock would never lust after a human woman in TOS, much less use her as his sex slave. Clearly, Abrams was just trying to sex it up for the sake of once again appealing to LCD viewers. As a result, there are many very excruciating minutes of screen time wasted on this trashy smut. Uhura is NOT supposed to be the inspiration for Quark's series of holosuite program entitled ""Vulcan Love Slave"", but Abrams has trashed her character into being that.<br/><br/>Abrams adds insult to injury by having the script canonize the non-Trek Enterprise show (which didn't have any Star Trek label on it when it originally aired), whilst simultaneously implicitly erasing the entirety of every other Trek show. Erasing garbage like TNG and Voyager is fine. But erasing TOS and DS9, which are both bona-fide masterpieces that are VASTLY superior to this Abrams movie, is an inexcusable slap in the face to the decades of hard work of much better men than J.J. ""SHAKYCAM"" Abrams and his 90210-in-space script-writing kiddies. If you are gonna erase something, then the replacement should be better, NOT 10 000x worse, as the Abrams movie is when compared to either TOS or DS9.<br/><br/>If you like mindless, smutty entertainment built upon the awful foundation of SHAKYCAM, then Abrams' Star Trek is for you. However, if you want to see Star Trek at its full potential: masterpiece works of art, you must check out Star Trek: TOS (the 1960's television series with Shatner) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (the 1990's television series, and only other good Star Trek show)."
"zetes","7","34","70","15 May 2009"," Star Trek for people who don't like Star Trek. Basically, it's Star Wars.
","The Star Trek the Trekkies have been fearing since this was announced: a dumbed-down Star Wars clone. As such, it's okay. It's a fairly entertaining space opera. It's fast paced and exciting. What it isn't is Star Trek. Star Trek is about man encountering the unknown and dealing with it with science and philosophy. There is weird stuff going on in this one - time travel, in particular, which in the original series was discovered early on and which served as the basis for many episodes and a couple of the movies - but the situation is urgent and the characters have no time to think about anything. It's just rush rush rush. The film does get most of the characters right, thankfully. Except for one instance, which I'll discuss shortly, the casting is brilliant. Zacahry Quinto in particular makes a perfect Spock, and I absolutely loved Simon Pegg as Scotty. Likewise, John Cho of the Harold & Kumar movies was a great choice for Sulu. Chekov doesn't belong, of course, because he wasn't on the Enterprise until later, but they got that wrong in The Wrath of Khan, too, so I guess I can't complain too much. The one exception to the excellent cast is Chris Pine as Kirk. He's excruciatingly bad. I'm certainly not asking him to impersonate Shatner - God no. But he doesn't capture any of Kirk's intelligence, or even charm. He's not quite as bad as, say, Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels, but he's in the same category. He's just a brash youngster whom you certainly wouldn't want captaining a vessel. The movie spends a heck of a lot of time showing how cool he is. Even when he's doing something smart, like outsmarting the Kobayashi Maru program, they never really depict him as being smart. We don't see him changing the program, as he infamously did, and it never feels like he believably could. There's some fun to be had here, but only dumb fun. Maybe they'll improve the formula some in the inevitable sequel. I'll definitely give it at least one more chance (the series that is; I have no desire to rewatch this film)."

","I actually have no problem with Hollywood creating these empty action movies with an explosion every 2 seconds and sort of a mind-numbing MTV boom-boom mentality. I just wish they didn't label it Star Trek. This movie is many things, but Star Trek it is not. The ship is true to the original Enterprise, and that seems to be where the similarity to Star Trek ends. Oh, and the guy who plays the young Spock is good, as is Bruce Greenwood.<br/><br/>This Jim Kirk is not a likable sort, nor is this Dr. McCoy, or this Sulu, Chekov, or Uhura. These Romulans seem to enjoy tattoos. Interesting.<br/><br/>I was not predisposed to like this movie. And it did absolutely nothing to win me over. It actually irritated me to run into these plastic imitations of old friends (the Star Trek characters).<br/><br/>I suppose the producers made a barrel of money here. But the movie is a steaming turd."
"SDplus","2","14","25","4 October 2009"," This is a storyline disaster.
","When I first heard of a Reboot of Star Trek my first thought was this: ""Good, Now they finally can make good for Roddenberry and true Star Trek fans by eliminating Time travel from the storyline"". Then I heard Nimoy was in it and playing ""Old Spock"", and I thought: ""Uh oh"". Then the premieres came and people said that they handled time travel well, and mostly to get Nimoy in there. I still wasn't convinced so I held out for a while.<br/><br/>Well, now that I have seen it I feel insulted and violated. The story writers seems to have been standing at the edge of Roddenberry's grave and pissing on it while writing this. Roddenberry never intended time travel to be used other than for quirky thought experiments in one off episodes. Time travel was and is a cheap way to solve sci-Fi problems. Good Sci-Fi use solutions that you think would actually work sometime in the future. Star Trek held this true (except Transporters which is acceptable as it doesn't pollute story and saves time in the storytelling) until Voyager started to introduce this as ""truth"". Which led to temporal directives and other equally stupid mechanisms.<br/><br/>The Reboot should have been used to stop insulting thinking Star Trek Fans. It should have got rid of Time Travel altogether. This Franchise Reboot is an insult to intelligence and if a new reboot series spins off of this it will fail as miserably as Enterprise did. And it is for this reason. Get good scientifically respectful writers back. Forget time travel.<br/><br/>This was a disaster for the franchise."
"herthh","1","13","23","1 January 2010"," Why to even write one more review? This is so awful...
","When I peruse the existing reviews, some of which are so excellently worded and analytic, I could actually just say ""ditto"". What is the probability that someone would even read yet another review, another 1-star? Apparently the indignation caused by the watching of this drivel provoked in me the need for this senseless act. Allow me to create one more outcry of protest. Let us put it on a pile of others.<br/><br/>So dear Film-Studios, here is some trivia about Star Trek, you do not care about, with observations you will not read or regard: Star Trek was a saga of space exploration, of scientific and social mystery with moral dilemma. The characters involved were highly educated specialists with civilized behavior. Their way of life and their world of technical advancement has authentically influenced our contemporary technical development. The flat screens, laptops, smart phones. We saw it all before... in the Star Trek.<br/><br/>Your storyline is driven by simplistic behavior of people who would pick a bar fight, smash someones face, or rather massacre it bloody. By any standards, such violation of conduct implies a long, very long prison sentence and possibly a psychiatric observation. Need an example? Think of this lady astronaut, who driven by jealousy traveled boldly across the country with bad intent! This act alone, without really hurting anyone was enough to get her expelled and fear a prison sentence. Your embarrassing movie is a remake of a Wild West western, crossed with Star Wars for that matter, but has nothing, literally nothing to do with the Star Trek and its spirit. We saw this dilemma already in the last full time movie ""Nemesis"" and in the so boldly failed and canceled series ""Enterprise"" with Scott Bakula. The screenwriters idea is somehow reduced to a demonic or psychotic ""nemesis"" of mankind and Federation, its a Wreck Trek with computer generated images.<br/><br/>It proves that studio delegates are not a replacement for visionary geniuses. Please do watch Star Trek Next Generation, DS9 or Voyager, listen to William Shatner's analysis of your failures, try to understand. Than: even DS9 and Voyager turned slowly into a wrong direction of a cosmic soap opera spanning Las Vegas and Luau, probably a real life horizons of the involved screenwriters. But even than the series never lost its intellectual and humane face. And please, no Mr. Abrams involved any longer in the franchise! Let him make Fast and Furious VII, or Before Star Wars III, maybe even Species VI. Keep him out, please. This franchise needs a filmmaker with intellectual traits, in the style of Contact, Abyss or Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>One more mystery intrigues me here: How this fury of bad reviews come together with the average rating of whopping 8.4, as it is today on Jan. 1 2010? I will let your own imagination play the detective in this case. Go boldly with your analysis, where one has gone before... Into a sweaty boxing studio..."

","First I watched the film and was entertained.<br/><br/>Then I read the appalled comments and was amused.<br/><br/>Afterwards I finally started thinking on my own.<br/><br/>Now I just feel stupid and vacuous.<br/><br/>I wonder why we people are so easily swayed by external, artificial beauty and why we get emotional over cheap colourful plastic manufactured goods. There must be some logical explanation, though, cause it obviously works like a dream. Except, if you have a single thought in your head, you wake up with a terrible headache.<br/><br/>I feel like I was raped by a nice-looking vampire who hypnotized me into believing anal sex is very nice indeed. I liked it very much, I squealed in ecstasy, but now the vampire has evaporated in the morning mists of truth and awakening, I feel defiled and violated.<br/><br/>Yet I have only myself to blame, now.<br/><br/>This film is a study in how much incoherence, discontinuity and illogical feelings or the lack thereof a dumb audience (don't worry, I include myself into that category) can take before vomiting.<br/><br/>Well, apparently we are made of strong stuff and we can swallow almost anything if it is wrapped in something shiny. We are omnivores indeed, and we stoop and pick up anything that catches our eye and looks like it's edible in order to still the vast and eternal hunger inside.<br/><br/>It is the hunger for love, and beauty, and friendship, and acceptance, and, maybe, just maybe, a hint of immortality. Yet such a film could grant you that no more than a Jesus action figure endlessly crackling out through its tiny loudspeaker ""I am the way, the truth, and the life"" until its battery is dead. No, you're not! But I still buy you, for what else should I do with my money? Give them to the poor so they could by Jesus action figures instead?<br/><br/>Anyway, the concluding scene is no doubt meant to evoke tears in the eyes of Trekkies and mortals alike, and although I am a mere mortal, I too felt the moisture.

"ensign-5","1","21","41","4 June 2009"," Send this movie to sick-bay!
","I was VERY disappointed with this movie and I am completely baffled by all the positive reviews. It's just the same tiresome formula of aimless hyper-action, with minimal character development and an idiotic story-line. Several scenes were blatant rip-offs from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and with the exception of the new Spock, the acting seemed more like a Saturday Night Live spoof than a serious film.<br/><br/>In fairness, there are some nice exterior shots of the Enterprise - I particularly liked the scenes of the shuttle bay. But for the most part, it's in your face action all the time. It's moderately interesting for the first twenty minutes or so, but the lack of drama and an implausible story makes the action meaningless and boring. Like so many of the over the top CGI-heavy films, the producers keep the explosions coming in the hope that you won't notice the lack of story. After an hour, I just wanted the movie to end.<br/><br/>The movie basically gives the finger to any serious fan of the old series, but it is sure to irritate any thinking person who has served in an organization that requires training and discipline. The film asks you to believe that a group of twenty something cadets would be put in charge of the flagship of the fleet. It compounds the insult by asking you to believe that the most vulgar and boorish cadet would be made captain! Imagine today an obnoxious nitwit twenty something cadet being made captain of an American aircraft carrier - preposterous, even in wartime. The old series never insulted the viewers intelligence in these kinds of ways.<br/><br/>I could go on but suffice to say that the film is full of absurdities like this. I had high hopes for this prequel but in future I will just stick to the old episodes on DVD."
"allbell","6","17","32","11 May 2009"," There's no continuity with REALITY
","I worshipped Star Trek: The Old Show, and I like Abrams' efforts to reboot the series.<br/><br/>All of the actors did a fine job of capturing the spirit of the original characters without doing imitations. Example: I love Shatner's Captain Kirk, but I also love Chris Pine as Kirk.<br/><br/>Especially during the first half of the movie, the tone and rhythm of the script were great. Kirk had great, Kirkian lines, and Spock had great, Spockian lines, and so on with the other characters. Certainly, the characterizations were a bit different than in the Old Show, but the plot explains those differences. And, really: if George Washington characters in historical movies can evolve over the generations, why not Kirk and Spock? So, for me, the new Star Trek works fine as a ""reboot of the franchise."" The problem is that it's a mess of a movie. Because I want the Star Trek franchise to live long and prosper, I'm thankful that non-fan reviewers are being kind to the movie, but I'm amazed.<br/><br/>First, the character of Nero, the bad guy, is completely underwritten.<br/><br/>He used to be a miner, his wife and kids died in a nova, and he has a ship that looks like a bush. Other than that, we know NOTHING about him. We don't know whether he used to like to take his kids hunting dragons, or if he drinks tea with Romulan wiggle worms, or whether he collects rocks from planets he's destroyed. There is nothing distinctive about him.<br/><br/>Second, the plot makes no science fiction movie sense, let alone scientific sense.<br/><br/>Nero destroys Vulcan. Spock, who knows about time travel, has come back in time and seen Vulcan destroyed. He ought to be talking about trying to use time travel to keep Vulcan from getting destroyed. But he never does. He just uses time travel to give the young Kirk and young Spock fatherly advice, without ever discussing the possibility of using it to prevent civilizationicide.<br/><br/>Third, in the second half of the movie, the captain-crew relationships aboard the Enterprise make no human, naval or Star Trek sense. This Kirk is rowdier than the original Kirk, and that's fine, but we don't ever see half a scene with Kirk even pretending insincerely to get along and obey rules. If he were really like that, he couldn't serve on a Somali pirate ship, let alone get through three or four years of military training. Also, toward the end, Kirk publicly mutinies, Spock dumps him on a Vulcan ice moon, and then, at some point, Kirk psyches Spock into losing control so that he'll turn command of the Enterprise over to Kirk. And then, at the end of the movie, he and Spock are all luvvy duvvy. Sorry, but that's not how boats, ships or human beings (or Vulcan-human hybrids) work.<br/><br/>If, say, Abrams' first assistant director had mutinied the way Jim Kirk does here, is it possible that he could ever work with that first AD ever again? Is it possible that the producers would let either him or his mutinous, out-of-control first AD stay in charge of the movie? I doubt it.<br/><br/>Individually, each of these problems might not be that big of a deal. But the overall effect is to make the action in the second half of the movie seem random. We know that stuff will blow up because it's the time in the movie when stuff should blow up, and we know Kirk and Spock will end up getting along at the end, because that's the time in the movie when people get along, but the action makes no actual sense."

","Just caught an advanced screening of this tonight. As one who never really enjoyed Star Trek, I found myself pleasantly surprised with how likable this movie was.<br/><br/>The casting itself is one of the great pluses to begin with, especially with Zachary Quinto who manages to make being Spock look so easy. Simon Pegg delivers very well as Scotty with funny moments, but not being too over the top - good job there. And Anton Yelchin definitely steals the show in any of his scenes as Chekov.<br/><br/>Kirk was well-casted too, but the others definitely warranted a greater mention.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this movie was that it managed to be genuinely funny, without compromising itself. There are so many brief moments and quick gags that work with snap precision. The worst things I can say about this film was the somewhat weak plot and the superficial character development (understandable, given how many characters were shoved at us). But everything else was awesome enough to divert focus from the minuses.<br/><br/>If you've never seen anything Trek, or maybe saw one or two episodes - you will like this. If you've spent your life hating Trek - you will still like this.<br/><br/>I certainly do. 8/10<br/><br/>(PS: Stargate: Atlantis fans be ready to spot Paul McGillion as the Barracks Officer)"

The story - The story to this film is just completely generic there is nothing to attach yourself to. Some of the dialogue (""are there still sandwiches in the future?"") is really bad and some of the character moments (I'm looking at you Scotty and Checov)come off as annoying and cringe worthy. In fact every single line that Scotty has is a gag. No joke, every single one of them. Very few of them are funny.<br/><br/>2. The lack of themes - I felt little drama in this movie. The great old Star Trek films dealt with issues like mortality, living in a world where your enemies are now your friends. There is nothing of the sort here. There is no depth at all.<br/><br/>It is like a big empty soda can.

This is not Star Trek, but some odd and extremely badly done mixture of almost any other Sci-Fi movie, especially from the post-Alien era, mixing everything in a disaster of its own kind; some creatures and sound effects from Star Wars, atmosphere (especially the Romulans) from Aliens/Dune and the general effect overload of today, everything in a wild, implausible story, but no Star Trek! And please don't ask for the figures compared to the ones from original Star Trek or the actors, it's just a joke to see them.

","This film was a step backward in the whole star trek series. A huge step back, and i am not just talking about the time period in the story. Here are the various problems i have with this movie.<br/><br/>1. The non CGI scenes/Sets - OK, you go from these very good CGI scenes showing advanced spaceships flying around to scenes inside the ship. You have the bridge(futuristic) to the engine room(Looked like a chemical factory), in fact, it didn't even look like an engine room on a ocean going ships of today. How exactly can you go from advanced looking sets on the Scott Bakula star trek on reruns today(which takes place earlier than this one), and then get this big screen production that looks like they spent about 10 bucks on the set, and they rented an old chemical factory for filming. and what about the scene when they are flying up to the enterprise from earth? all those futuristic ships hanging out in an old half moon Airship Hanger(at least thats what it looked like?) 200 years from now, we still have old crappy hangers? I can go on and on and on.<br/><br/>Long story short, if it wasn't CGI, it looked like crap, and looked like they didn't put any effort into it.... Scotty being shot through water pipes like Super Mario down the drain? Stupid..<br/><br/>2. The casting-- The guy they got for Checkoff, was forcing it so so bad, it ruined the movie. I know he was trying and i have seen him in some other movies and he did well, but not the right person.<br/><br/>3. Dr McCoy, Definitely, not good.<br/><br/>4. The chick they got for Uhura was good, and fit the part. Seiler fit Spock Fairly well, Captain Kirk, not bad, but with everybody else mimicking the original characters, why deviate on him? 5. The musical score, Guys, why in the hell do the sound effects sound less like the star trek movies and more like the 60s star trek show? they only sounded like that because it was the 60s, this is 40 years later, they should do better.<br/><br/>4. Overall, this movie was great CGI, no story bad sets, and bad casting. Hopefully they try better on the next one.<br/><br/>Some of the cheesy sets/acting ruined this movie. Hopefully this doesn't kill the series.<br/><br/>Bad, i cant believe the trekkies liked it."
"mgruebel","4","5","7","11 February 2014"," End of an era
","In ""The Omega Glory,"" a Star Trek episode from the 1960s, the words of the US Constitution are repeated over generations, until they become mere sounds babbled by Yank(ees) and Com(munists) who no longer understand their meaning, nor why they are fighting one another.<br/><br/>This pretty much describes the handing down of Star Trek from Roddenberry to Braga/Berman and finally to Jeffrey Abrams. Abrams is a journeyman action director, not a visionary auteur like Roddenberry, and in his hands Star Trek is just CGI babble.<br/><br/>The plot of the film falls apart within minutes - usually it takes time travel stories at least one or two acts, or in the case of the original series episode ""Tomorrow is Yesterday,"" a perfect loop even restores consistency. If a Vulcan tried to save my Romulan home planet with 'red matter' and failed, but we were both thrown 100 years back in the process, we'd just try again, succeed, end of film, even in the ""new time line."" We have 100 years to fix the problem in whatever time line. I certainly would not use the precious red matter to implode my near-savior's home planet Vulcan. The Romulan is psychotic, you say? I don't think a logical and highly organized warrior race would let psychotics fly its expensive space craft. End of film.<br/><br/>It's a pity because the new cast is pretty good. I would have hired Gary Sinise as McCoy, but Urban is nice. Quinto is a good Spock, but let's leave out the romance with Uhura, shall we? <br/><br/>It became even clearer with ""Into Darkness"" that Jeffrey Adams just does not get Star Trek as a cultural icon, and so Roddenberry's vision must linger for now, enfeebled into CGI action nonsense with puerile plots, while we wait for someone who understands the Great Bird's positive and sophisticated vision for humanity's future. In an episode of Voyager, the first officer catches a woman recently freed from a cyborg collective playing a piece from Robert Schumann's Kinderszenen on the piano, with a metronome. He asks her to abandon the security of the metronome and play the piece again as a human. That is Star Trek. This is not."

","Let's be honest here, if this movie wasn't successful it might have been the end of the Star Trek franchise. The Deep Space, Enterprise and Voyager TV series didn't have enough of a fan base to support a feature film series of films. The original Star Trek crew and The Next Generation crew are both too old to really compete with current blockbusters. Even though the actors from the original Star Trek series are too old now the characters themselves were still very popular in syndication and replay of their movies. So starting over with them with younger actors in the roles is really the best way to go. Plus with them doing it where it's more of an alternate history instead of a reboot they can do new stories with them without having to worry about ruining the original Star Trek's lineage and poking holes in their stories."

"mike-ryan455","6","22","44","10 May 2009"," Underwhelmed, almost disappointed
","I have been a Trekkie since it came out on NBC. I've seen them all, all the movies, all the shows. This one disappointed me.<br/><br/>No, I am not disappointed by the new cast. Most were good, especially Zachary Quinto as Spock. Quinto showed great versatility, a completely different person than Sylar. What I am disappointed by is the new characters. The action of this new Spock were not that of the historic Spock. His on screen romance with Uhura simply did not fit.<br/><br/>Also, I am totally disappointed by the lack of any sense of following the chronology of time events we have seen throughout Star Trek. Spock was a junior officer on the Enterprise when Chris Pike went down to Talos IV. That means the Enterprise could not have been on its maiden voyage. That's one small example of the screw-ups. Ranks, assignments, so many things just wrong.<br/><br/>These are the faults of the writer and the director. J.J. Abrams, with his experience with Lost, surely knows better. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are from from Abrams's Fringe studio. I enjoy Fringe, but obviously they just are not up to Trek.<br/><br/>People rave about special effects, but that does not impress me. No amount of special effects can make up for bad writing."
"agentsteel666","1","15","28","8 May 2010"," Ridiculous and Nonsensical
","I'll be honest. This movie impressed me. Never did I think it was humanly possible to cram so much stupidity and pointlessness into just 2 hours of filming. But I gotta hand it to J. J. Abrams, because he seems to have an extraordinary ability at sucking the life out of eager, good promising movie goers.<br/><br/>This is not a sci-fi movie by any stretch of the imagination. It is clearly a comedy, yet it is so shockingly pointless and retarded that I don't know if I should laugh along with it or fall asleep out of sheer boredom. When we think science fiction, we think intelligence. We think mystery. We think. PERIOD. To anyone who has any thoughts in their head, this movie is a drain on our spirits and our livelihood, and it turns its back on the sci-fi fan, and instead appeals to the stupid, clueless hordes of modern day American media consumers.<br/><br/>Instead of trying to follow Gene Roddenberry's vision, the makers of this movie crammed the screen with pointless sex scenes, pop music, sports cars, and special effects. Is society so dumb that they can only attend a theater if the movie is full of these types of things? Why did Star Trek become so successfully originally? They didn't need to rely on the sexiest, most flashy imagery they could use to sell fast tickets; Roddenberry created something original, something that made your imagination and intellect be put to use, something that made you think, and something that had brilliant plot lines with a script that made great sense, from start to finish. This new movie had one of the worst, most cheesy scripts I've ever witnessed, and the plot, whilst being somewhat OK, failed to develop itself one single bit throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>I can't honestly tell you what the point of this movie was, but one thing you can be sure of is that this movie was empty to the intellectual, the philosopher, and the free thinking man. Many of the scenes made no logical sense and were randomly put in place for no rhyme or reason, other than to take up space or perhaps to entertain the brain dead masses. The only positive spin you might be able to put on the film was if you imagine that it was a MADTV skit or an MST 3000 movie, because the directing, the acting, the plot, and the overall mood of the movie will only give you a lot of laughs and giggles with your girlfriend as you make out with her. It's one of those movies that just fill the screen with a sort of easy access amusement, that doesn't require any attention or effort to appreciate, much like the original Star Trek. It truly was 2 hours of wasted space. I give this movie a generous rating of 2/10."
"tjbussesf","3","9","15","1 January 2012"," Numerous plot holes, clichés, reads like an episode, not a movie
","In his commentary to the 1990's series ""Babylon 5,"" screenplay author J. Michael Straczynski often pointed out flaws in the competing but wealthier ""Star Trek"" franchise. One complaint was the self-enclosed Star Trek format (as opposed to B5's plot arcs) led to the writers creating a major species or element to use in an episode without any presaging of that element. It is discovered, used, and forgotten about all within an episode. <br/><br/>In this film, the main offender is ""red matter"" which can apparently create a black hole at will. Where it comes from (the future) and how it works has no history in the Star Trek canon, and I doubt it will ever show up again. A traditional deus ex machina comes in at the end to save the day; in this film, it gets the day going, keeps the suspense up, then saves it. More to the point, it makes little sense. The writers ask us to believe that sometime in the future an aging Spock is sent out alone in a ship alone to save the universe (this is not a spoiler: Leonard Nimoy appears in the opening credits of this prequel). This when the future has fleets, a strong population, and, presumably an abundance of red matter. The only convenience of such a device is to get Nimoy into the film. Sending a crew along (the ""logical"" thing) would wreck the casting budget.<br/><br/>In creating a prequel, writers always face a certain amount of plot contortion, especially in such a canonical series as the Star Trek franchise. Here, they have perhaps broken a few too many rules, the chief one being this film ends with a time-travel plot causing major changes in the time-line that do not match the rest of the Star Trek series. It is OK to go against formula in a movie, but with time-travel plots (which are already a bit too hackneyed in the Star Trek universe) one goal is to end with everything working out exactly the way we have seen it in the series. Part of the viewer's interest in these plots is how it will manage to turn everything the way it should go. We saw it in Star Trek IV, in Generations, in Nemesis. By not setting things right, the movie is a major letdown.<br/><br/>Numerous other inconsistencies abound. In this movie, when all the major Star Trek characters are shown in their academy days (a la Starship Troopers) we see student Spock programming a test. Is he a student or a teacher? Both, apparently. And the film breaks so many military protocols that you wonder how the human race advanced enough to build starships. The cadets go into battle because the fleet is all grouped elsewhere and away from their flagship. Navies learned to avoid that mistake at the battle of Midway. The writers could have used a line from the 2011 Muppet movie, ""Hmm, this sounds like it could be a important plot device."" Time for more red matter."
"sonthert","3","9","15","4 December 2010"," Continuity? Ridiculous?
","Suffice it to say, I like Star Trek. One of the things I liked about Star Trek was its integrity. Yes, I know that's a big word to be throwing around nowadays, but STiNG and TOS were unitary in my mind...STiNG being a natural extension on TOS. STiNG did a pretty good job of keeping continuity with TOS. The movie series, bereft of truly stellar efforts made a few splashes with installments #2 and #3.<br/><br/>I LOVE the work of Simon Pegg (""Shaun of the Dead"", 2004 ""Hot Fuzz"", 2007). He cinched the purchase for me. I even like Anton Yelchin (""House of D"", 2004, ""Alpha Dog"" 2006). Both's later roles have been a lot more tenuous, but these two actors alone gave me some hope for Star Trek.<br/><br/>Star Trek has now come full circle. Deep Sleep Nine, The Enterprise, and Voyager stunk. They weren't entirely a betrayal, but they had run the course with the line they had created, but movie-genius writers couldn't get off the train anymore. The series lost wide-spread appeal. Name any long-running series that hasn't had the same problem? Here's a franchise we can't bury quietly. Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner are old men, we can't do a new series and have them do a ceremonial walk-on role to christen the rebuilt series unless we act quickly! What's the solution? Make some implausible story that allows at least one of them to do a role to ""authenticate"" the work that would make D.C. Fontana cringe in horror. What shall we do now? Go the way of Star Wars. Suck as much money out of the franchise as you can, sacrifice the integrity. Keep pouring it on. Make more sequels. Broadcast TV hasn't hit a wall in terms of rating from doing the same thing at all. <br/><br/>Why go back to the original series and set fire to it? Why not create something new from the ground up? It worked before with STiNG. What you failed on in the later spin-offs was broad appeal. Lots of preachy talking with too much fan-pandering. Go back to what formerly made Star Trek great. The philosophy. Genuine human ideas and questions that lots of thoughtful people can relate to. Gene Roddenberry might have been the genius with the philosophy, but lots of people see what was going on there. <br/><br/>Some people who saw money-making potential of Star Trek (2009) in somebody else's philosophy without seeing the point of it. It is not Star Trek. Why bother calling it Star Trek, why use the same characters you could stand to reuse on a regular basis 10 years ago? Don't worry that your ideas and constructions are almost direct rip-offs of the compromised George Lucas Star Wars franchise, which Star Trek (2009) most certainly is. The most casual viewer can see a similarity between Kirk's car ride and Anakin Skywalker's rocket sled ride in The Phantom Menace. <br/><br/>I spent the first half of the Star Trek (2009) thinking ""Wow""...the second half I got distracted and was counting the myriad of contradictions and pointless character conflicts. Why would Spock, a man of peace, a man who would not harm another being in the way he was raised for some 20-some years prior to his posting on the Enterprise throw Kirk off the ship? Do you really think that a time shift could explain a complete reversal of his character? This is consistent with modern movie and society's thinking. We are just corks bobbing up and down in the currents. We are not born to be one way or the other, we are not a sum of our progenitors. Not to mention his taking up with a woman! It strikes me that one of the most unbelievable features of Star Wars (and Star Trek now) is that the same people find their way back into each other's lives like some cosmic coincidence? Somehow, time changed in the Star Trek universe, and everyone ended up in the exact same place yet with altered personalities? I'm remembering STiNG ""Parallels"" right now or even worse TOS ""The City on the Edge of Forever"".I'm sure many people have explanations for myriad of discrepancies. They've been explaining the plot holes for years (Why do Klingons magically change between TOS and STiNG again?). Some people are satisfied, some people like me are skeptical and say its easy to make up an excuse why you did something after you did it when you didn't have a reason when you did it. Why did you break mommy's vase? You didn't tell her it was to maximize box office draw or that time travel made it possible for it to be broken and unbroken at the same time. <br/><br/>IF I had never seen anything having to do with Star Trek (or Star Wars), I might say it was a 6/10 effort. The Genie is out of the bottle; it can't be undone. Here's a prediction. I hope I'm wrong. The sequel to Star Trek (2009) will be awful. Rip-offs don't invest in new stories or originality...they invest in driving it into the ground. Since people have bought into eating whatever the headmaster puts in front of them in terms of Sci-Fi, they will drive this into the ground too. The same problem plagues Broadcast TV. We've seen it before and spiraling budgets sate people temporarily, but good movies live on forever, despite their budget. They fail to understand that new ideas drive box office interest...and interest drives sales. You can't short-cut straight to the sales without acknowledging the mortality of the medium. <br/><br/>Originality is to movies as defense is to football teams. They are the tie-breaker for the championships. Do you want to make a good product and make money or just make money? Those are the two choices.<br/><br/>Star Trek (2009) failed as a concept, as an idea, its implementation. As a movie it was passable."

At first glance, it is superficial, plain boring and naive story about the future of the mankind and exploration of space. It is clear that the world created by Gene Roddenberry had to be cut to fit the limitations of the sixties TV screen. Therefore we have lots of not too fortunate ideas - bunch of human-like ""alien"" races (which are, let's be frank, humans with various skull deformations), pseudo-technical gibberish and other bizarre episode-ideas, deteriorating the quality of the whole series (such as holodeck, retrospections, incoherent time travels). Yet, when You dig a little deeper, a whole new layer gets uncovered. Star Trek provides everything Sci-Fi has to offer: contact with another civilizations, artificial intelligence, time travels, ghost in the machine, interstellar war, You name it. It doesn't mean that everything is a top quality, but some episodes are truly memorable.<br/><br/>Recently, one of the major flaws of the franchise started emerging. Being a classic TV show, Star Trek has a lot in common with the theatre, where most of the scenes are static and actors deliver their speeches standing still or walking slowly around the corridors. The remedy for that, Enterprise, apparently did not fit the needs of the audience and was prematurely cancelled (personally I don't understand why, as the worst show in the franchise, Voyager, lasted for full seven seasons).<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams, who was in charge of the newest movie installment definitely decided to go in the action-oriented direction. He was surely a good choice when it comes to explosions, chases and firing weapons. However, as mentioned above, Star Trek is not about that, and here Mr. Abrams failed completely. On the other hand, it is hardly surprising, as the screenplay was written by two Hollywood ""titans"", Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, responsible for both Transformers...<br/><br/>I can imagine how the preparations to start production were made. They had the list with all the ingredients needed to create a great Sci-Fi blockbuster. ""Actors? Check! Special effects? Check! Enterprise? Check!"" The only thing missing was the script. Star Trek movies were never particularly good - the best stories were presented in the series. Unfortunately, the last four movies with the Picard team failed to attract the attention of the viewers and I can imagine why. Their scripts were perhaps adequate for 45 minutes episode, but to sell it for the big screen You need a suspense, intelligent twist and a little action. Picard-era movies lacked some of these traits. On the other hand, Abrams' Trek has nothing but action. Starships go into warp faster than anytime before, torpedoes and laser cannons fire more frequently, members of the crew act swiftly and without hesitation. Unfortunately, no one knows, why.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the movie are really good. Although the scene of the arch-enemy emergence is copied from the Wing Commander: Prophecy game, the first battle is well designed and shot. It also gives hope for the mysterious alien protagonist. Unfortunately, the quality of the remainder of the movie is steadily deteriorating. The main characters have absolutely nothing in common with captain Kirk's crew - it's a bunch of teenagers, who accidentally happen to be on the main ship of the Federation. The ""story"" about the time travels-driven vengeance is neither interesting, nor logical. Appearance of the ""old"" Spock adds nothing to the plot and is completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>However, the most amazing thing is how the fandom, which buried Enterprise, accepted all the revolutionary twists in this movie, which practically erased all the previous installments. All the series and movies just never took place. I am terribly sorry, but even if someone doesn't like the Star Trek world (as appears to be the case with Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman), its abundance offered so many options to expand the story and to continue the legacy of Kirk, Picard, Sisko or Archer that resetting the whole franchise is not only a cowardice, but also a proof that the screenwriters didn't have a clue what to write.<br/><br/>Apparently creating a good Sci-Fi story is much harder than it seems. Recently, only Starship Troopers 3 were successful in this field. On the other hand, most of the Star Trek movies were below average (except Voyage Home and Undiscovered Country), so a good story would be much appreciated here. Unfortunately, it seems that the following years will not bring anything special - it is highly unlikely that the next movies will be better than this one...<br/><br/>In conclusion, some good news: Star Trek Zero (Eleven?) is not the worst Sci-Fi movie this year!!! Anybody saw Transformers 2 or Terminator 4?"
"ifeito","1","9","15","20 June 2009"," Terrible, I love JJ Abrams, but here he just didn't respect the original franchise
","I found this movie to be a complete misconstruction of what Star Trek is supposed to be.<br/><br/>The moment child Kirk appears driving a Corvette and doing a bunch of unreasonable and unjustified stuff just to show off special effects I knew I was in for a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Chris Pine is a huge miscast. Or at least he was terribly misdirected. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Somewhere along the movie they DO try to justify why the ""new"" Kirk is so different from the original, but it still doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** Casting Leonard Nimoy seemed one of the good parts of the movie, but abusing the duplicity on the final scene was absolutely unnecessary.<br/><br/>The whole movie is done without any regard to science fiction or the original Star Trek series. For instance, some scenes were shot on ceramic tiled corridors that look like they belong on a cold war movie, not a science fiction classic.<br/><br/>Characters seem dumb and one dimensioned, I love J.J.Abrams work on Cloverfield and Lost, but he clearly had a bad one with this film.<br/><br/>I came out of the movie theater feeling shortchanged and greatly disappointed."
"Bello-4","3","9","15","12 May 2009"," JJ Abrams Creates Own Star Trek...To Loyalist Dismay!
","First of all, this may contain or elude to spoilers...<br/><br/>That being said, I want to be open minded. I acknowledge that Star Trek has become bogged down as often being ""message"" heavy. And maybe perhaps Trek does need a reboot, or at the very least an injection of more action and less talk.<br/><br/>So, I'll give props to where props should be given. Star Trek by JJ Abrams is a beautiful looking movie. The effects were by no means skimped on and to those whom that sort of stuff matters, you will not be disappointed. I also appreciated the cast as they were the right people for the role with the exception of the individual whom played Checkov (to young for the role). And lastly, the storyline with the exception of a few minutes held itself together and kept moving. I observed no cell phones lighting up with people attempting to check the time until the movie would end. It was very much a hold on and lets go kind of storyline.<br/><br/>However there's also a lot wrong with this movie. As a Star Trek purist I should have heeded Abrams advice and stayed home. JJ Abrams takes wide license with this movie and that's saying it nicely. While it's interesting to see the beginnings of each character as their origins has never been ""officially"" delved into, we're also to believe the following...<br/><br/>JJ and crew have at best taken a wide license with interpretation or at worst didn't bother to actually watch an episode of old Trek for the purpose of research.<br/><br/>Engineering abroad the Enterprise and the USS Kelvin look more like a vessel from Battlestar Galactica or a contemporary freighter. Open, dank, dirty, pipes and conduits exposed and everywhere. And the Enterprise herself? What were you thinking JJ? What have you done? That's just has to be the worst interpretation (okay, just horrible) of the starship Enterprise I've ever seen. Some things you just don't mess with. Trek is known for its crisp and clean look, inside its starships and out.<br/><br/>And whom builds their starships actually ""on"" Earth? Starships are massive vessels and are built in space for obvious reasons. Not the middle of Iowa (which is convenient for young Kirk I guess). But there's a reason that the US Navy for example doesn't build carriers in Iowa but rather along the East Coast. Use some common sense JJ!<br/><br/>The interior corridors and the bridge where a significant amount of the movie takes place look like something out of a video game. I mean I understand that in reality, time changes things. For those whom watched Star Trek: Enterprise, set one-hundred years or so before TOS, did you really expect something that looked like it was from the 70's? Well in the movie I certainly wasn't expecting the bridge of the Enterprise to look like something you'd see on Playstation or XBox.<br/><br/>A Romulan mining ship that can time travel? Really? Since when? And just what kind of future arms a mining ship with enough fire power to take out a flotilla of Star Fleet vessels that it itself dwarfs? <br/><br/>JJ, you destroyed Vulcan! That's just not right man! How could you? Star Trek has enough unexplained areas for you to play with, but somethings you just should leave alone. If you accept this movie as part of the Star Trek lore then it fundamentally changes everything. It means that the Vulcan everyone knows and refers to is actually the ""new"" Vulcan and Spocks mother is killed in the process of said planets destruction (despite appearing in a few TOS episodes and movies). It's as if someone were to reboot say...Star Wars and decide Vader didn't need to die at the end of the last movie or something as equally paramount. Why bother destroying Princess Leia's homeworld with the Death Star. It looks menacing enough. Did you even bother to watch any of the episodes in order to see what you should've left alone??? <br/><br/>I'm really am crossed about this movie. I want to both like it as it really reinvigorates Trek. It instills it with new energy that some of you will agree that it needed. But also I'm disappointed with this movie for the reckless abandon that was used in writing it without caring about the damage being done. Trek fans are already arguing over which series cast they like better, or the interpretation of this or that... Now we're going to argue over which movie reality we like better to! <br/><br/>KB"
"OzOverTheRainbow","1","8","13","24 January 2019"," A horrible film.
","The writers took everything that was good about Star Trek and threw it out the window. This isn't Kirk. This isn't Spock. This isn't anything. So tell me. If Vulcan is destroyed, how do we have any of the Star trek canon make any sense at all? I will never see another Star Trek film made by this production company."
"exquisite-2","1","8","13","29 July 2011"," Crap movie ruining the Trekker universe.
","I never thought the last TNG movie ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" was up to par, mostly due to bad plot. However in this movie ""Star Trek: Overgrown Teenies"" i can't find a single good point, the core story is fairly strong or more so could have been, with better effort from the production team but they managed to f**k it up completely. The casting was awful both when it came to looks and acting, not even Leonard Nimoy managed to deliver, his performance felt very out of character and below par. Chekov was pure cheese, and so was the needle-doctor on ""young kirk's"" back. Uhura exposing Kirk sexxing with green-alien is also very disturbing, cheesy and unbelievable since we all know they will get-it-on in the future. Spock fighting Kirk was another low point, and breaks both what we know about the star trek universe and the characters, we all know Spock just could have pulled the Vulcan grip on him but he doesn't.<br/><br/>The movie tried to ride on the Trekker tide, when it in fact could have been just about any sci-fi or action movie made in the past 10 years, with that said much of the acting and side plots is cheesy, unbelievable and served with awful line-deliveries just as most action movies are nowadays. If you want to see a good action sci-fi movie I suggest ""Serenity"" if you want your ordinary sci-fi tech-nerd cravings re-fueled watch some good old TNG, Voyager, firefly, Babylon 5 or ""Space: Above and beyond"".<br/><br/>Conclusion is, don't pay anything to watch this. I didn't, since I am good at recognizing crap merely from watching trailers. Oh and yes Bruce Greenwood was good, kudos to him!"
"inic-nemanja","10","8","13","31 August 2010"," WOW are the only words to describe the movie
","after waiting for over a full year to get the movie, and watching it... I'm honestly amazed. I expected a lot, and got SOOOOOO much more... The plot is classic star trek, and, 'cause I'm a Trekkie ( :D ) at first I thought, wtf the killing of Kirk's father ain't mentioned in any of the series, or the movies. The start off was phenomenal. The corvette and the selection of music hit my nerve (in my language, that ain't as bad as it sounds :D ). the sound effects are even more wonderful, and the battle scenes are even better. The best two parts (in my opinion) is Nimoy's appearance, and mentioning Archer's dog. I'm so amazed by the movie that I don't think I can write anymore :D"
"Arthur21743","2","8","13","24 May 2009"," Punk with Attitude Takes Over Starship - Saves Universe
","Whew! Where to start? Kirk can't keep a car from falling off a cliff but somehow has the moxie to command a starship and understand all its workings while still in the Academy... and where he was about to get drummed out of the service for messing with the mumbo-jumbo unwinnable scenario at that! Ergo, Spock testifies against him at the hearing and so they start off their relationship as adversaries. Was the groundwork EVER laid in the original series to even hint at this version of their meeting?<br/><br/>Then too, Spock somehow innately knows how to drive an alien ship because in the future he had somehow gotten familiar with it, and therefore he kinda has the knowledge before the fact back here in his younger days. Does that make any sense, even given the futuristic setting of the Star Trek Universe? But to make this foreknowledge credible we have the presence of the aged Spock (Nimoy) existing as a contemporary of his younger self.<br/><br/>Was this a sop to appease the older viewers and give this new version of the Star Trek Universe some sort of credibility? Personally, I can't see how Leonard Nimoy could have consented to lending any legitimacy to this version by appearing in it at all. Maybe he just needed the money. Maybe principles and loyalty for all that went before got a back seat to a lucrative offer. Who knows?<br/><br/>And what about the fact that in a previous Star Trek movie James Kirk says he changed the no-win scenario's programming and got a commendation for original thinking? In this ""effort"" Star Fleet Academy was looking like they were going to run him off for cheating.<br/><br/>Also, in the original series there was enough of a Vulcan civilization to man at least one entire starship with a crew comprised of all Vulcans, so forget about this Vulcan-getting-destroyed jazz. Spock's mother had appeared in the original TV series as well, so there goes the black-hole nonsense, count two.<br/><br/>And speaking about the black-hole stuff, how about the fight scene aboard the black-hole driller where the camera goes into hyperspasm and gets a terminal case of the jitters? I guess this is to cover up the fact that Kirk can't carry on a convincing fight scene. But then too, I don't guess he was very good with his fists anyway, or he would not have gotten the crap beaten out of him back there in that slop chute. LOL<br/><br/>All I can do is echo the other reviewers that complained that this was done by people without the creativity and integrity to invent their own premise, so they instead took a cheap shot and just appropriated Roddenberry's idea... and corrupted it to give their usurpation of the franchise a fake air of originality. This shows ignorance of all that has gone before, or worse—<br/><br/>Contempt for the original concept and arrogance by the ones who came up with this story... in other words, people who think they have the right to do whatever they freakin' please for their own ends.<br/><br/>If you are a younger viewer who is not familiar with all that has gone before, this movie can be entertaining — even dazzling. But for those who know the history of Roddenberry's version — at least in my opinion — the playing of the TV series' theme music during the final credits was a slap in the face."
"Qouarin","4","31","66","8 May 2009"," This is not Star Trek
","I can't say much more than what other naysayers have already said. They basically spit in the faces of all of us who have carried Star Trek for 40+ years. I blame Paramount and JJ Abrams, but I also want everyone to remember to ""thank"" Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman for further ruining what has almost always been an excellent franchise.<br/><br/>Even if I were not a fan, I would not recommend this movie. It is full of continuity errors, very little plot, and shallow characters. As with most movies these days, there is plenty of running around blowing things up, but not much else. If you don't want to have to think, go see this movie. If you want to retain some measure of intelligence, pass."
"namkhanh-26689","10","6","9","1 December 2015"," Star Trek became Star Wrek
","Okay, I know there are lots of holes in this review, much like the movie. For example, I'm not even a true adult and it's been 6 years since the release of Star Trek. But a review can't kill anyone, right? And please note that there are spoilers in this review, so watch the movie first and then read this if you haven't seen the movie in advance.<br/><br/>The movie itself was, to be honest, entertaining. Yet, plot holes are scattered all across the script, and I bet it would take a critic to go through a few short lines and immediately trip on one of them. Let me list them all, or at least most of them:<br/><br/>Star Wars's main theme is explosions, shooting, running, explosions, explosions, shooting and death, and I'm sure I mentioned explosions. Star Trek's theme is discovering the universe and its life forms. Now, Sir J.J Abrams turned it into Star Wrek. You try scrolling through the first 10 minutes of the movie. Explosions. Explosions. Death. Shooting protons and phasers. Running crew striving to survive. Explosions. Man down. Death of two captains. All I'm saying is that Star Trek became more militaristic and violent than it originally were in TOS. <br/><br/>Now, let's scroll through the rest of the movie. Unlike the original James T Kirk, this one is a brat, immature and flirty. Yay, what would his mirror version be like? I have a feeling the alternate reality became the mirror universe whilst the mirror universe became the prime reality. What the bloody hell?! (It's made-up)<br/><br/>Okay, so let's talk about the prime antagonist. Nero, a man who is coincidentally named after a Roman Emperor, with 0 logic. For instance, he hates Spock, a man who tried to help his home planet but failed. And did Spock cause the supernova? NOPE. And did Spock denied to help? NOPE. He flew the ship there, with knowledge that a chance for survival is critical if the supernova incinerates his vessel. The man put his life on the edge, to save Romulus. And all the blame points to him? Where's the logic? Oh right, he's just a miner, how could he possibly know that? <br/><br/>And, how is the Narada, a such OP starship, a mining vessel? It took out 47 Klingon warbirds and 7 starships, without minor or none damage visible on the hull. Then, if every single miner in 2387 possessed this ship, then Romulus took over the universe in days. <br/><br/>One of the prime faults of this: the goddamit scale. Example: In TOS and the old movies, it takes hours to travel from one planet to the other at warp speed. Now, you can travel from Earth to Vulcan within 3 minutes, at warp factor 3-4, barely 1/3 of the speed of the starships in the original movies. Space tightened...So now, Vulcan is like four solar systems away. Yay! <br/><br/>That is hellalot of plot holes, and honestly, I cannot list them all. But on the other hand, it is undeniable that the music was incredible, and the new effects and design of the Enterprise is absolutely beautiful, with even more realistic effects. The main problem with the effects is that there are too many ""lens flares"".<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10 star"
"TexasRedge","4","6","9","11 May 2013"," Are the people who are giving this movie high marks over the age of 14?
","They should have named this movie ""Star Trek: Abomination"". I don't know where to get started.how about the plot!<br/><br/>:::::: WARNING –SPOILER ALERT::::::::::::::::::<br/><br/>Now, I don't have a problem with J.J. Abrams doing a Star Trek movie that is a Prequel to the original 1966-69 TV series. I know that many of my fellow Trekkies had issues with that, However, I didn't have any issues with that. That is not my gripe.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is the plot, I mean did adults actually write this script? And if Yes, then did they ever go to science class? ((( and how the hell does it have an 8.0 rating here on IMDb, didn't any of the people who saw this go to science class either? <br/><br/>Okay, the movie is about a renegade Romulan Captain named Nero who travels back in time 80 years just to get revenge on Ambassador Spock for failing to save his home planet in the future. Apparently Ambassador Spock was going to stop the Romulan sun from going Super Nova by injecting it with something called red matter that would implode their sun and created a artificial black hole. Did it not occur to anyone that if you implode a star and create a black hole, which the Black Hole created would also destroy the Romulan home planet? So either way the planet would've been destroyed. And why doesn't Nero ever go to his home planet and warn them about the coming future catastrophe, No, instead he just floats around in space for 25 years doing nothing as he is waiting for Spock to arrive. This is just stupid. Then J.J.Abrams has Nero destroy the planet Vulcan, thus destroying 50 years worth of canonized Star Trek movies and television shows (all of which involve planet Vulcan). And what's up with those product placement ads.. come on man, this is Star Trek, 300 years in the future and people are still using Nokia phones, drinking Budweiser, and driving Chevrolets..

"quinnox-1","3","6","9","3 February 2011"," Weak science fiction movie with little relation to Star Trek
","This is a movie very loosely connected to Star Trek, they basically took the character names from the original series and threw in a cameo by the original Spock and then wrote a lame action movie screenplay that has nothing to do with Star Trek themes.<br/><br/>But even as a dumb action movie set in the future this has little to offer. Sure, there are a few good action scenes in it, but the story is so stupid and distracting with most of the main characters being very dull and played by bad actors that the movie quickly becomes a bore to watch.<br/><br/>The cast is largely terrible, with only two bright spots, Karl Urban as Dr. 'Bones' McCoy and Anton Yelchin as Chekov. Urban is especially entertaining as Dr. McCoy, he plays it as a homage and does an excellent imitation of the original character, voice and mannerisms. But he doesn't get much screen time, and once he goes off screen the movie loses much of its fun. Yelchin as Checkov is good too, with a hammy Russian accent and a mischievous gleam in his eye and he plays it up to the hilt.<br/><br/>Still, these two can't stop the movie from being a failure. A confused and disjointed story line doesn't help. And with the villains being some of the lamest in history, they are dressed up as gangster thugs and dumb as rocks. Who ever thought these characters would make interesting bad guys should be fired from screen writing."

No real surprises, nothing original.<br/><br/>The cast all do a fairly good job although they are hampered by having to continuously mimic to their future selves. The plot is very simple and straight forward, quite childish in places but reasonably consistent.<br/><br/>I always found Star Trek to be simplistic and aimed at children, claims that this is a more intelligent and adult version <br/><br/>are nonsense, teenagers will probably love it and Star Trek fans will too, for any one else it's not worth bothering with."

We see the captain of a starship left on the bridge as his pregnant wife is evacuated along with the surviving crew. He gets to play his disposable man routine while she's giving birth. Trite or what? When will women finally become so emancipated as to start sacrificing themselves for their men? How many centuries before males obtain equality? From then on it's downhill all the way. Even the special-effects are second-rate. Characterisation is two-dimensional. Storyline is the typical mishmash of space/time paradox.

"jbirtel-1","4","7","11","19 November 2009"," Wear A Bib!! You're About To Be Nose Pinched, Spoon Fed & Burped !
","Here's a text book case of a movie that requires no acting skills...just re-acting skills. A famous actor once stated that the reason there were so few acting challenges in sci-fi films was because the characters were reduced to saying things like: ""Wow...look at THAT""; or ""RUN...Here it comes again!"".<br/><br/>That statement was made just before the TV Star Trek original, before 1968's 'Planet of the Apes', before '2001: A Space Odyssey' and before Science Fiction in films tallied up the big bucks. So if we knew that over 45 years ago, how come, in 2009, we get lame-brain, 6th grade dribble dialog that, from the 1st scene (Kirk's birth), rarely rises above...6th grade dribble dialog? But maybe I'm being a bit harsh. By comparing, I wouldn't want to insult the intelligence of the millions of 6th graders out there who are certainly smarter than what this script presented. I was just surprised that Kirk didn't tell Mom to ""give the kid a 'Koochie, Koochie Koo' for me! OOOPs ! Gotta crash, gotta go!""<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin. The title's CALLED 'Star Trek'. The credits SAYS there's characters called Spock, Kirk, McCoy...etc. But at no point do you feel that the characters are the younger versions of their original counterparts. The cast was a bullseye, so it wasn't their fault. But was it necessary to reduce them to the ridiculous?<br/><br/>Both Gene Roddenberry and William Shatner rightfully agreed that the literary classic Captain Horatio Hornblower (an early 19th century British Sea Captain) was the inspiration for Kirk's heroic Commander. So why was the new Kirk based upon INDIANA JONES? That Lucas/Spielberg creation was a throwback to the 10 part cliffhanging serials from the 1940s. Jones was reckless, a loner that got himself out of scrapes in ways that only a movie producer can provide (often, just dumb luck & bravado). But Jones was rarely a Leader and certainly never a Commander responsible for 400+ crew members and the many 'planetary populace in peril'.<br/><br/>Ironically, I had no problem with the shaky camera work in 'Cloverfield' because the nature of the story demanded it and (more importantly) the length of the shots were long that allowed the special effect laden scenes to unfold and the actors to act. I felt none of that in the new Star Trek that felt more like the camera operator went out for a smoke and left the camera on wheels with the auto focus turned on (even though the camera movement was way less jittery). With the editing 'quick cuts' overused, you're supposed to feel thrilled. I just felt numb.<br/><br/>CGI is still in its infancy which means technology will constantly be improving it. It's unavoidable that some special effects will look outdated as time passes. What will never become outdated is a great story, smart dialog, good directing & acting, and sharp editing. If the film has those qualities, the special effects for their day, can be forgiven because the strength of the story carries it through. The imploding planets in Star Trek doesn't even hold up by yesterday's standards. They looked like lap-top downloads. And with the characters simply re-acting to action, in a sitcom generic way; the quality acting and quality dialog are out catching a smoke right along with the camera operator.<br/><br/>The only satisfaction I derived from Leonard Nimoy's presence was updating the current score to: William Shatner; 7 Star Trek Movies. Leonard Nimoy; 7 Star Trek Movies. Seven Movies each! Seven Paychecks each! Score's even-steven. Hah !! Take that, Bill Shatner ! <br/><br/>About one third of the original TV show represents TV's finest from the mid-1960s. The Star Trek movies 2, 4 & 6 are bonafide classics. Aside from a few hiccups, the originals had major qualities and, when captured on film, just plain soared. Given that, the best of Star Trek always represented intelligent fun, smart drama, quotable character interactions; and their disciplined reactions to their military & fantasy challenges. <br/><br/>What a shame that the franchise reboot resorted to clichéd scenarios we've already seen more than 20 times in 20 years that jettisons the audience intelligence into the proverbial warp factor. The first scene between Spock and his mother was so gaggingly excruciating, that it almost seemed a blessing that her demise means we won't be tortured by Winona Ryder portraying...'Winona Ryder' in plastic putty make-up in any future installments. I realize that 'gaggingly' is not a real word, but I couldn't think of a real word that describes it better. Did ALL respectable, talented middle age actresses turn the role down?<br/><br/>William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and the rest of the originals had the goods on what made their characters tick. These actors brought a wealth of background stage training. When they clicked, they were spot on. The new version just looked like the actors were going thru the MTV motions without any real substance. That blame should be right at the decision makers (by committee) to not only Reboot, but Revamp the entire structure of what defined Star Trek. What ended up emerging was this: a slam-bang; quick cut; just react, don't act; noisy; say-it-simple and keep-it-simple for our global market audience; a dumbed-down product that will undoubtedly fatten the studio's financial coffers.<br/><br/>And never did I expect ""Live Long and Prosper"" to be turned into a cheap 'kiss-off'. Looks like the Star Trek Dignity has a nicotine thing going too (right outside with the camera operator). But the camera operator is only allowed to do what the director tells them.<br/><br/>I walked out of Star Trek 5. I walked out of this one too (with a refund). Several months later, I rented this on Blu-Ray and tortured myself for 2 hours. After that, I couldn't wait to get back to doing the dishes, raking the leaves and going to the dentist for my root canal."

When Kirk is taking the Kobiyashi Maru test, the ships on screen are quite clearly Klingon Battle Cruisers and yet they were referred to as Birds Of Prey, what a crock. The entire Star Trek Encyclopedia is now wrong and has to be re-written to incorporate the alternate time-line the crew of the Enterprise now inhabit."

","Where to begin... It's official now, Star Trek has a plot hole in it so big you can fly the Death Star through it. I was hoping to like this movie, really. But there were so many things wrong here, so many I don't know where to begin. But I'd swear the people behind this film have never seen another Star Trek anything, it only seems like dumb luck they have references to other Star Trek series. Which those references can no longer count as Trek continuity now being changed those events that create such comment might not happen that way. So the references are now pointless quips and meaningless. This is why so many writers should stay away from the time travel thing, they're not smart enough to remember what they started with. The only good points to this movie was Karl Urban's role as McCoy and the soundtrack."
"D-Defoe","3","7","11","25 May 2009"," Good main actors - Bad story- No science
","Being a large consumer of any seriously mentionable Sci-Fi-movie here my opinion: The choice of Kirk, Bones (in German: ""Pille"" for ""pill"") and Spock was very good,similarities in behavior and faces were existent.Medium choice:Uhura and Sulu Worst choice:Chekov (although I had fun with his Russian dialect),and Scotty (too pale. The real Scotty was my favourite) The real Spock was unfortunately too senile in this movie(78),but in former times unquestionable great.The overall story dumb in many aspects,especially the revenge background, especially because Nero could had used the 25 y of being thrown back to warn his planet and his wife (she was maybe young but still living). A flat villain a one dimensional story with one sense: force melding all the old crew members of Star Trek together within hours.<br/><br/>Scientifically many,maany,maaaaaany strange inventions and assumptions:<br/><br/>Topic Singularities: -Singularities in their destructive behavior swallow the whole Vulcan planet from within in a matter of just a few minutes.Why was the suction effect like that of a funnel in a sandbox? The singularity in the core of the planet would attract the matter around it just equally and form maybe a crushing and shrinking sphere-not a funnel.<br/><br/>-Lovely senile Mr.Spock(maybe because of the German translator he sounded senile) managed to shrink a supernova with a mere drop of liquid red matter contained in who knows what kind of containment field(left for the scientific public to discover afterwards), within a small spaceship.Buthas anyone thought of the energies produced by a supernova?He would have been burned to ashes, even the Romulan planet exploded within seconds. In what containment device he put that little red drop (looked like in ""Blade"")? Why not beam it ? <br/><br/>-The supernova being so gratefully sucked into that black-worm-hole-thingy and nero and poor ""too-old-for-that-sh. (cross-reference: Lethal weapon)"" Spocky afterwards...where was the amount of that supernova-energy in the other galaxy ? And why Spocky and the others didn't get crushed ?.<br/><br/>-Megalol on the final encounter with the red matter...all was spilled within the Nero-ship...one should expect the the whole universe including the cinema theater and its audience should be sucked into Nihilation...but as always the omnipotent remedy to all scientific and household problems is: throw in as much as you can, best if you do it with your warp cores (especially because warp cores have more energy than supernovas)!!A lot helps a lot (this is also my credo when washing my clothes with detergents...)! <br/><br/>Topic Beaming: -Sometimes beaming is just a matter of how dear the actors are to your heart sometimes necessary for bending things into the correct order. Beaming moving objects is maybe difficult but omnipotent Russian 17-year-old-nintendo-playing chekov is well trained in doing that with the joysticks just in time in case of beaming Sulu and Kirk up. Strange enough, that he doesn't manage to beam Spocks mother up, since she just started to fall.I think Chekov didn't like Spocks mother.That must be the reason.He never mentioned it.<br/><br/>-Beaming towards far away, moving objects is accomplished in just a few minutes? But how long was Kirk unconscious in that rescue pod?A few hours?During that time how far did Enterprise travel?Assuming traveling only with light speed (in fact it is more than that I know)where just 18.000.000-km are gained each minute,Scotty is able to locate the ships interior to beam Kirk and himself inside. Interesting enough, that he was not beamed into the warp core or ships hull but inside a big watertank. Spocky was maybe wiser than that and beamed himself directly onto earth since distance does not to seem to be a matter here.<br/><br/>Topic coincidence -what lucky coincidences sometimes exist I experience in my own life, and so it must be like meeting an old school chap somewhere in the Antarctic, when Jim meets Spock on the otherwise (except for an outpost and monsters from StarWars)uninhabited planet ""Hoth"" (cross ref. ""Star wars Ep. V""). -Since sometimes there happen clusters of coincidences, why not add one more: Scotty is also there with a wimp who reminded me of Oompa Loompa (cross-ref. Charlie and the chocolate factory) and indeed it is ooompa loompa !!! What a coincidence !<br/><br/>Topic clichés: -Alien ships must always been constructed and designed dangerously outside, but even more inside. Even if it was a mining ship something like a railing on the walkways never evolved. Poor future workers will slip on banana skins and free fall to death. <br/><br/>-Sympathetic Eric-Nero-(burning must Rome)-Bana must die a dreadful sucking death within a singularity (although he survived it the first time unharmed). Depends maybe of the size of the red blobs<br/><br/>-Superhero kids are omnipresent nowadays,and so 10 year old Kirk jumps out of a car falling down a cliff. Young Anakin Sykwalker was as tough as that too in the pod race. This is omnipresent glorification of ""cult"" heroes. Maybe Anakin Skywalker build his first organic nanobot within the womb of his mother...oh sorry I drifted off to another strangely similar movie in many facets. <br/><br/>-This ""funny"" swelling of the hands and lips and clumsy acting due to allergic reactions is well known in ""Hitch-the date doctor"", ""Star Wars -episode I"" with Jar-Jar (but in different context) and many other movies. Creating jokes is just taking them from a list of everfunny gags and converting them to the different settings <br/><br/>-Always, ALWAYS, Aliens who attack earth start in the United States, mostly in California, because of the beaches, the sunshine and the nice dolphins. Strange I missed the American flag...but it must have been somewhere hidden to my filtering senses. <br/><br/>So my global impression: 3/10 for the many colors I have seen."

","First let me say I'm an old Trekkie. I liked the old series, hated most of the movies, except Star Trek II (which far surpasses this mess), hated most of the TV rip-offs except Enterprise, which could have been interesting if they hadn't fallen prey to the need to create a single villainous species to fight. This movie was pure garbage. Yes it looks quite pretty but it has the worse movie score and, quite frankly, the worst dialog I've ever endured. It was nonsensical, loud, mindless and with so many Kirk gets beat up fight scenes that I wanted to puck! The characters were comedic without any decorum at all. The continuous banter just amped up the mindlessness of the so called story. You know when a movie is going bad when they resort to Alien monsters and Tyler Perry substituting for a Morgan Freeman like character. After seeing those two things I was done and just wanted it to be over. I wish I could give this movie a 0, but you don't have one. Too bad there will be a sequel."
"kerniraelflord","4","23","48","12 May 2009"," Well that boldly went nowhere
","I can't say that I was excited going to see this movie but seeing as it was Majel Roddenberry's last film I decided to spend money instead of waiting for the DVD release. I should have gone with my first instinct and not wasted my money because this was simply not a good film. I am a lifelong trekkie but I am also a film fan and I have most certainly been pleasantly surprised before so I was willing to give it a shot. What I ended up seeing convinced me of what the previews had given me an inkling of, that JJ Abrams should be in a mental institution and not on a Hollywood set. First problem with the film has nothing to do with the canon question, in fact I'm willing to take the events of the film as canon, but many of the shots were too busy. Throughout much of the movie I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to be focusing on there was so much going on at one time. Second problem is the fact that the production designer needed to be kicked in the face. By all means make the new Enterprise your own but don't make the interior sets look like some disaster of a factory when you're supposed to be on a starship. Starships are like submarines, everything has to do its job and take up as little space as possible otherwise you'll end up with some monstrosity which can't fit into the hull.<br/><br/>On the upside I thought the acting was solid. With the exceptions of John Cho and Ben Cross everyone managed to pull their weight and put out a decent performance. I also did like the script, wasn't great but I've seen plenty worse so I'll roll with it seeing as they did try their best to make their own Star Trek without ignoring the original.<br/><br/>All in all I don't think this movie is worth seeing and I hope that if a sequel or spin off series is made Paramount decides to kick Abrams to the curb and bring in a competent director to handle it because Trek deserves better and frankly so do the actors."

","Nowadays, Hollywood has to be big FX and heaps of emotion, and this Star Trek delivers in spades. It was always going to be a hard task to introduce the original characters without large chunks of back story, and despite JJ's professed ""It's not foot on the gas, foot on the brake, foot on the gas..."" that's exactly what this film is. There are a few stunning scenes, but mostly we endure learning about who the main characters are and how they came to be aboard the Enterprise. And none more ridiculous than James T himself. He is portrayed as delinquent child, womanizing hell-raiser, insubordinate, yet academically gifted. Unbelievable. And never mind the many plot holes. Spock has more story than anyone else, and the main plot devise revolves around him. Unfortunately, it is a pretty lame devise. I expect the future films to be much more action, but this intro movie is mostly dull and I found it hard to care about many of the characters. I saw it on the big screen, but I can see why people download movies."

The story is equal to all the bad movies, with the typical American cr*p plot. I'm terribly disappointed. Picard got screwed over because of this poorly inspired director. Use real men, not kids.

"Uriah43","5","2","2","31 December 2013"," Style Over Substance
","This movie starts off with a battle in space between an unknown alien vessel and a ship from Starfleet. On the ship is a man named ""George Kirk"" (Chris Hemsworth) who has been given command because the Starfleet captain has been summoned onto the alien vessel to parlay. The captain is subsequently killed and George Kirk manages to keep the enemy ship occupied while his passengers and crew attempt to evacuate by emergency shuttles. On board one of these shuttles is his wife who is giving birth while the battle rages and the father dies. The young child's name is ""James T. Kirk"". Years pass and eventually several of the characters from the original ""Star Trek"" meet at Starfleet Academy. These include ""James T. Kirk"" (Chris Pine), ""Mister Spock"" (Zachary Quinto), ""Nyoto Uhura"" (Zoe Saldana) and ""Dr. Leonard McCoy"" (Karl Urban). Other characters are also introduced in the course of the movie. Now, as far as the actors were concerned I thought that each of them performed adequately with their individual characters. However, on several occasions the actors were required to perform ""out of character"" and this weighed heavily upon its credibility. For example, the romantic relationship between Spock and Uhura is both unfounded and unwarranted. Another problem was the manner in which certain segments of either the television show or Star Trek movies were taken and ""made over"" which created a totally different outcome or perspective than originally broadcast . An example of this would be the ""Kobayashi Maru"" scenario which has Kirk acting much too cavalier--even for him. Afterward he is summoned to appear before a board of inquiry and is strongly condemned. However, in the movie ""The Wrath of Khan"" he is supposedly commended for his originality. Now, I realize that this film attempts to differentiate itself from both the Star Trek television series and previous Star Trek movies. Yet at the same time it seeks to establish the characters identities in relation to the televisions series and previous movies. Apparently the makers of this film figured that the creation of a time-warp would allow them to accomplish both tasks. But in order to be successful they probably needed to be more cautious on what they wanted to change. In this case change for the sake of change wasn't really necessary. Be that as it may, I think those viewers who enjoy style over substance will probably really like this movie. Star Trek ""purists"" on the other hand might have issues with it. Although I belong to the latter category, I understand that this movie is all about establishing an ""alternate reality"" and sets the stage for further sequels which are intended to develop a life of their own. Because of that I suppose it deserves the benefit of the doubt. That said, I rate it as average."
"smg242","10","2","2","1 September 2013"," J.J. Abrams is really the new hope!
","Let me get things settled first. I'm a Star Wars fan. Hell, I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan. And like most of the other Star Wars fans, I used to hate Star Trek, and I never gave the series, or any of the movies a chance. When this film came out in 2009, I, of course, shunned it. I didn't even know that J.J. Abrams was directing this, although I had seen a couple instances of his work, notably the TV show LOST, and Mission Impossible III. Of course, I didn't know because I never even wanted to know anything about the horrible franchise that I THOUGHT Star Trek was.<br/><br/>The year, 2012. Walt Disney Pictures buys Lucasfilm and the rights to Star Wars, and announces Star Wars Episode VII, the seventh Star Wars film. I was starting to think of directors that could handle Star Wars perfectly. I never considered Abrams. Then, Disney announces J.J. Abrams as the official director for the film, releasing in summer 2015. Almost immediately, I googled Abrams and his work in film. I found that HE was the director of Star Trek, and began to wonder why a Trekkie director would choose to helm a Star Wars film.<br/><br/>So, recently, to check the directorial ability of J.J. Abrams, I did what no other Star Wars fan would do: I watched the 2009 reboot of Star Trek. And I loved it. I loved it a LOT. It had the SAME kind of energy in it as the energy in the Star Wars original trilogy. And that is QUITE a feat for any filmmaker. The lines are snappy and the plot is surprisingly VERY well-written. The characters are actually memorable, and the acting is top-notch. In my opinion, Chris Pine as James T. Kirk is the best thing about the movie. He's like a mix of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. But, obviously, the writers didn't just copy the traits of those characters. There is a certain originality, which makes the character so epic.<br/><br/>The other cast is great as well, and the special effects are amazing. And for those complaining about the lens flares, they actually FIT here. J.J. just wanted the future look bright and shiny. Of course, I wouldn't advise him to overuse it in Star Wars. Ah well, to each his own.<br/><br/>This film remains as one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time. Also, this film is actually a prequel to the later events of the Star Trek movies. So, this is undoubtedly, for me, the best prequel ever. Now THIS is what you call a spectacle!<br/><br/>I'm eagerly waiting for Star Wars Episode VII. J.J. Abrams is the ultimate choice for a Star Wars film, and the series is in the perfect hands. He may really be 'a new hope' for Star Wars..."

"johnnyboyz","6","2","2","11 April 2013"," Story and substance come second to a brave, brash and thoroughly accomplished rebooting of some old favourites.
","The 2009 rebooting, re-envisaging of the Star Trek franchise drops us head first into its franchise's latest adventure - adventures often consisting of large groups of shrewd crew members commandeering grandiose, deep-space travelling vessels and getting into strife for our viewing pleasure. As if a dogfight between two spaceships wasn't enough to open a science fiction/action blockbuster, American director J.J. Abrams throws in a significant death, on top of an equally significant birth; a time travelling space ship ganging up on a ship half its size and a highly dramatic escape sequence. You can practically see the grin on the man's face as he unleashes this opening sequence onto fans of the franchise, who are likely stoked to the point of frenzy in the first place.<br/><br/>If the general consensus was that the generation of Enterprise crew members whom followed that of the original crew, consisting of Kirk et al, were never quite of that standard in energy and engagement, and that the films of post-1991 followed a similar suite, then Abrams effectively blasts his way into a new era; new canon and new depictions of old favourites with this one, swooping opening movement at once encompassing just about everything you possibly could to open a reboot dramatically. In essence, the whole thing's gone ""Bond/Batman"" on us – the old crew are back for the first time since 1989, but the twist reads something like: most of the people playing them weren't even born at that time. This of course translates into the fact the crew of Kirk, Spock, etc. are in their youth and we follow their progress here from lowly kids on their respective planets to employees for the peaceful, respectful and reassuringly indomitable intergalactic organisation of StarFleet.<br/><br/>That said, the film is almost frightened of formally taking on such an idea; the throwing in of a time travel-driven narrative calls to mind past ventures while a later scene actually dares to bring back one of the original crew in their older form. Likewise, and where people often cite Wrath of Khan as their favourite franchise instalment, this 2009 reboot dares to periodically invoke said film with its inclusion of mind slugs and that seemingly unbeatable examination we witnessed in ""Wrath's"" opening. In spite of all its bravado and slick visuals telling a rip-roaring yarn featuring incarnations of people we're fond of, it is quite extraordinary just how ordinary the film actually is. In spite of everything that arrives with it, and in spite of the fact it's difficult to watch it without a smile on one's face at the best of times, the film is painfully commonplace as a standalone work of filmmaking. There is an unshakable feeling that narrative and conflict came second to the primary focus of rebooting, something inherent in the relatively weak narrative idea that this crew of people must merely set out to save the world.<br/><br/>When we begin proper, we do so way-back-when: far back enough for James T. Kirk to be a youth rebellious enough and spiteful enough to wreck his step father's car in what is an intuitive, brave and blasé response to a set-up; situation or person that grinds him. As Kirk grows a little older, he begins to resemble Chris Pine, who does a fantastic job in capturing the later mannerisms of Kirk – that odd, twitchy way in which he seemed to suppress nerves through stares and a brisk, sharp series of statements that cut to the heart of the matter. His renegade attitude from infancy carries over into young adulthood, his aggression and enthusiasm eventually channelled into joining StarFleet where he swaps the farms of Iowa for warzones set in deep space. Because everyone in the crew is still young, and the film is ultimately aimed at people of similar age, we get scenes set in bars; scenes of people haring down the roads in their automobiles to loud rock music and fleeting compositions of girls in their underwear during this juvenalised segment.<br/><br/>The villain is a Romulan named Nero, played by Eric Bana – but he makes for a poor antagonist: a snarling, skin-headed, heavily tattooed bad guy drawn from stock and going on to remind you of just how good he was in playing a character of similar visual proportions, although much more rounded, in 2000's ""Chopper"". Nero's unhappy at what happened to his planet far into the future, that is to say its complete destruction at the hands of the Vulcans and the Humans – travelling back in time, his plan is to destroy Vulcan and Earth instead of using this time travelling technology to save the planet or try for some sort of compromise is weak, and emphasises how the attention towards the general rebooting trumped anything else. When Kirk does eventually assume control of a ship for the first time, we take note of the meek substance surrounding his channelling of the grief born out of the death of his father at the hands of the Romulans, and how this differs to Nero's attitude to it all. Aside from this, Kirk himself is on a bit of a black list with the StarFleet higher-ups when we witness him cheat at that commandeering test – the film coming to resemble a proving of sorts that he can, in fact, handle himself. But this is a start, a kick-starting of a fresh series of films based further still on old ground; a series with a first film here I enjoyed enough to want more, old ground of which I do not know as much about the essence as many-a others likely do that I still relish in re-treading anyway. The film has its flaws, and cannot quite match the quality of some of the preceding entries, but it is almost certainly worth checking out."

Decades of Star Trek lore have been completely annihilated in this movie.<br/><br/>We meet the crew as they are at the academy, and straight away it's like one cheesy catch phrase after another. I just could not associate any of the characters with their future counterparts. Their personalities didn't really reflect each other. They looked like giddy teenage pals going to a Star Trek convention.<br/><br/>The whole storyline just made no sense at all, and with so many plot holes, technobabble, unrealistic sequences, and characters that I couldn't relate to, it just wasn't a good movie to watch.<br/><br/>On top of all that the only character I was able to relate to was Spock, only to me it wasn't Spock it was Syler with pointy eyebrows and ears and throughout the film I expected him to lift someone in the air and slice their head off.

I can see why there are so many peed off fans and negative reviews here, because quite frankly this film isn't Star Trek. It is a poor rehash that is quite frankly an insult to the fans. It has been a long time since I have shouted abuse at the TV and even longer since I actually felt like turning it off and burning the DVD.<br/><br/>The film had a distinct Star Wars feel to it. Vulcan children dressed like little Jedis reciting maths in strange holes in the floor, Vulcan children bullying???, Vulcan children fighting??? Everything about this film was off and I wouldn't be surprised if Abrams has never even seen a Star Trek episode/film...it would in fact explain a lot.<br/><br/>Some of the verbal abuse moments included:<br/><br/>* Vulcan being blown up with almost it's entire population * Spocks mother dying * Kirk being chucked off the ship in an escape pod (clearly Abrams just forgot about confining crewmen to the quarters or the brig???) I almost switched off at that point. * The revelation that those weird tattooed aliens I had been staring at for 45 mins were in fact Romulans! * The concrete breeze blocks in the pipe filled main engineering. Plus the fact I think there were multiple warp cores??? * Spock and Uhura * Everyone standing around watching whilst Spock almost kills Kirk<br/><br/>The list I'm afraid could go on and on and on.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is not the details but the fact that it totally trashes what Star Trek is about. Star Trek is a show that examines humanity, that questions morality and ethics. It is a show with brains, that encourages, develops and provokes thought. It is about exploration and politics, philosophy and society. It is a show that does not condescend its audience. <br/><br/>Star Trek 2009 stuck two fingers up at that and went another way. To sum it up this film is not a trek for trekkers."
"Dave_in_Toronto","4","30","66","11 May 2009"," Wow, was that disappointing!
","I've been trying to figure out the huge disconnect between what I saw on the screen and the very high score this movie has received on IMDb and I can't understand it. The audience in the theatre around me was completely silent throughout with no gasps or other reactions except for what might have been the faintest giggle at a couple of the incredibly corny lines. Usually, if a movie is good, people are laughing, crying, or at least reacting. This movie inspired nothing. And therein is the answer to the earlier mystery I posed.<br/><br/>Short on story and long on trying to cleverly introduce all of the characters we so loved from the original TV series, this movie was really just one long preamble of how this happy gang came to be, the kicker being that it is a completely respun version of the facts as we know them from the original TV series. I'd tell you why, except that would be a spoiler.<br/><br/>For about the last 20 minutes, Abrams and crew attempt to spin this into something with a story that we would actually care about but judging by the audience's reaction, I think the entire theatre would have been just as happy continuing to watch the new Kirk and the new Spock try to rationalize how they come to respect and admire one another, the root of the chemistry of the original duo. By the way, they fail miserably.<br/><br/>Sometimes even a poorly conceived story can be saved by special effects or good acting. Sorry, neither of those ingredients ride to the rescue. The special effects and acting were OK at best.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, because it has made so much money, Abrams has already been awarded with two sequels. Personally, I'd be much happier if Abrams and crew threw out this whole movie and started from scratch on the sequel, maybe watching the original series this time before embarking on the next movie."

The detriment that these have is to so far remove this film from any previous Star Trek in the last 40 years.<br/><br/>The crutch on which this whole movie rests it that it is set in an alternate universe, in which apparently JJ Abrams need not have watched a single episode of Star Trek. The characters are all fundamentally wrong, Spock is an emotional teenager, Kirk is an annoying drop-out, Urura is some kind of nymphomaniac, Chekov and Sulu have zero sense of humour and Chekov has one terrible accent. The only redeeming and genuine character is Karl Urban's Dr.McCoy who is perfectly portrayed by the New Zealander.<br/><br/>Finally there are dozens of terrible scientific, historical and continuity errors which not only go against Star Trek canon but even principles set out by this film itself. Black holes which have incredibly varying effects. Some which destroy planets, some which send people through time for some reason and finally those which have no effect at all. The main characters are horribly skewed and bare no resemblance to the characters we know and love.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is the worst incarnation of Star Trek ever, a bad script, poorly directed, with shallow characters and badly casted.

","In March of 2008, I still had a lot of hype for Cloverfield. I was just researching it one day, and I saw the J.J. Abrams, the producer of Cloverfield, was going to direct a reboot to the Star Trek franchise. I was somewhat excited, but I didn't care for Star Trek that much. When it was released in May of 2009, it was met with HUGE critical acclaim. I didn't hear one bad thing about it. So I decided to go see it. Let me tell you something, all of the positive hype gave me expectations, and this proved WAY better than all of my expectations. I walked in with a very basic understanding of Star Trek, and walked out fully understanding everything in that film. That was the beauty of this, it was for die-hard Star Trek fans and new fans alike.<br/><br/>It was a perfect mix of genres. Action/Adventure, Sci-Fi, War (with the Romulans), Comedy, Fantasy, and Drama (I bawled my eyes out when Spock's mom died). The performances were out of this world (no pun intended). Chris Pine, Zoe Saldana, Zachary Quinto, and Eric Bana were all perfect in their roles. Leonard Nimoy didn't just have a cameo, he had an enormous role, and he nailed it perfectly. In the sequel (yes it has been confirmed) I hope to see more of John Cho, Anton Yelchin and Simon Pegg. The one performance that just steals the show is Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy. He sounded and acted just like DeForest Kelley and I give him a huge thumbs up. The colours were great. It was a very gorgeous movie. Forget AVATAR (half sarcasm), Star Trek for the win. It was very bright, in fact, so bright that I lost count of the lens flares.<br/><br/>In the summer, I joined my sister on many occasions to watch various Star Trek TOS marathons. I really enjoyed them. I haven't really gotten into any of the other series', but I'm just fine with TOS.

","People must be getting pretty desperate for good movies if they like this film. I thought Spock and Scotty were pretty good, and the special effects were great, but the plot ruins it. (And I'm no Trekkie. I just like films that make sense.) The plot has so many contradictions and is based on so many coincidences that you'd have to turn off your brain to like it--and I'm not talking willing suspension of disbelief here, I'm talking full cranial lobotomy. The only way it's good is in comparison to recent stinkers--Pirates of the Caribbean2&3, Spidey3, etc.<br/><br/>Here's a list of the terrible plot elements: <br/><br/>1. Nero's ship exiting the black hole right where Kirk's father's ship is. OK, coincidences happen, so one coincidence is acceptable in any film, so let's give them one pass. However, it's pretty convenient that in all the vastness of space, Nero, who wants to avenge Spock's failure to save Romulus, comes out of the black hole right where the father of Spock's best friend is located.<br/><br/>2. On 5 different occasions, Kirk almost dies by nearly falling off a ledge: 1st kid Kirk and the car ride; 2nd when the parachute almost pulls him off the drilling platform; 3rd when the Romulan tries to stomp him off the platform; 4th when he doesn't quite make a jump in Nero's ship; 5th when the Romulan picks him up, he shoots the Romulan, and he falls right back down.<br/><br/>3. Nero never warns Romulus that their star will explode! The great thing about going back in time is that you can prevent terrible things from happening in the future, right? You'd think the 1st thing Nero would do after going back in time is fly to Romulus and warn them of the danger, but no! After blowing up the Kelvin, Nero just waits there for 25 years for Spock to arrive. You'd think that just once during those 25 years he might think, ""Hey, this is pretty dumb. I'm waiting here to get back at Spock for letting my planet blow up. Maybe instead of sitting here, I'll fly over and warn everybody. Then, I'll have nothing to be mad about!""<br/><br/>4. Kirk's warning Captain Pike that they're flying into a trap serves no purpose. Kirk warns Pike that Vulcan isn't encountering a natural disaster but is being attacked by an alien ship. The problem is that by the time Pike's convinced, they've already at Vulcan and they get attacked anyway.<br/><br/>5. Pike shouldn't have to be warned anyway. Pike did his dissertation on the battle that destroyed the Kelvin. He'd certainly come to the same conclusion that Kirk does.<br/><br/>6. After Pike is captured, Kirk immediately reverses himself and goes against the advice he gave Pike. In the scene just referred to, Kirk tells Pike that they will certainly be destroyed if they take on the alien ship that destroyed the Kelvin. A few scenes later, Kirk knows that his suspicions were right. However, at this point, Kirk now strangely doesn't heed his own warnings that attacking Nero's ship means certain death and argues so strongly with Spock in support of attacking Nero's ship that Spock has him ejected from the Enterprise.<br/><br/>7. Why don't the Vulcans attack the space drill themselves? <br/><br/>8. After young Spock sends Kirk to Vulcan's ice moon in an escape pod, Kirk just happens to land within a mile of where old Spock's ice cave is. Come on! We're talking about an entire moon here! That's like an astronaut ejecting from the InternationalSpaceStation (not in the movie; the one that's orbiting the earth) and landing a mile from where his mother lives.<br/><br/>9. There's no reason Nero wouldn't have kept Spock in his own ship in the 1st place. It seems like Spock would've had a pretty good view of Vulcan from Nero's ship and Nero would've had the fun of laughing at him too. Plus, Nero wouldn't have to worry about old Spock foiling his plans later on. (Maybe this one can be ignored. We've already established that Nero is a complete idiot.) <br/><br/>10. Spock's ice cave just happens to be next to where Scotty is stationed. Not only does Kirk land right next to old Spock but they seem to be a short walk from where Scotty is. In fact, if old Spock had done some hiking before meeting Kirk, he would've discovered Scotty on his own, which would have allowed him to warn Vulcan of Nero's attack.<br/><br/>11. Kirk is able to cause Spock to lose his cool in about a half minute. Spock must not have done very well on the Kobiyashimaru test. That test is meant to gauge your ability to make good decisions under stress. Well, we should be glad that Spock didn't have command under combat. He couldn't even withstand somebody making fun of his mother. It's strange that the Spock in the series virtually never loses his cool, but when it serves the purposes of the plot, Kirk is able to get him to lose it instantly.<br/><br/>12. No one is guarding Spock's tiny ship in the hangar of Nero's ship. This is just slight error on Nero's part, given that within Spock's ship is a weapon that can destroy planets. You'd think Nero would post at least a few men there to defend this valuable asset. Nope. I guess his men had better things to do.<br/><br/>13. There's no reason for Nero to want to destroy earth. His ""beaf"" is with Spock, not anyone on earth.<br/><br/>14. Nero's ship is ridiculously powerful. Does it really makes sense that a mining vessel from the future can take out a starfleet?<br/><br/>Oh yeah, one more: why does Nero hate Spock anyway? He was trying to save Romulus, right? <br/><br/>People need to expect more from movies or we'll keep getting crap like this!"
"escapeN2flixtion","2","9","16","26 January 2020"," Abrams' Trek 1: Nero Fiddled while Trek Burned
","Good grief. J. J. Abrams' attempt to reinvigorate one of the most beloved IPs in science fiction brings us ""Star Trek,"" a film bearing so little resemblance to the classic series that, frankly, giving it the title should be a sin. Upon release, the film was praised by fans and critics alike for breathing fresh life into a series long considered stale. To this day that positive reception baffles me. This film is a thorough wreck, with plotting and characterization so absurd they'd be embarrassments even without that lofty pedigree.<br/><br/>Star Trek has long been known for its more cerebral approach to sci-fi. While the series contained its share of fight scenes, it preferred brainpower to firepower when addressing the complex sociopolitical and scientific conflicts its heroes encountered. Abrams makes no attempt to give his reboot any intellectual credit at all, opting instead for flashy, adrenaline-pumping action spectacle and a rainbow of explosions to enthrall modern, millennial audiences. I'm still not convinced that Michael Bay didn't secretly direct this. ""Breathing fresh life"" apparently means turning the once thought-provoking franchise into yet another special effects extravaganza to rival Transformers. Star Trek 09 is filled to bursting with sex and explosions, strung together by a ratty plot that boldly pushes disbelief where no one has pushed it before.<br/><br/>In an ""alternate timeline"" story, a rogue Romulan named Nero launches a genocidal campaign across the Federation, destroying planets by injecting ""red matter"" (exotic goop that creates black holes) into their cores. Why is he doing this? Apparently, in the future Nero hails from, Romulus was destroyed by a supernova, and Spock, the only being who tried to stop it, was too late to do so. His attempt to suck up the supernova with red matter instead created a wormhole that sent both himself and Nero into the past. And so Nero vowed revenge against Spock, destroying Vulcan in the past as punishment for his failure. This is monumentally idiotic. How did the Romulans, a powerful spacefaring people, lack the resources to save their capital from this supernova, or at least evacuate it? Why was Spock the only being in the galaxy who cared to help them? How was a black hole, of all things, supposed to save the day? Isn't that replacing one threat with an even more dire one? If it only takes one drop of red matter to create a black hole, why was Spock lugging gallons of the gunk around? And why did Nero vow revenge on the only guy who tried to help?<br/><br/>Anyway, upon jumping back in time, Nero destroys the USS Kelvin, killing Kirk's father. This dramatically alters Kirk's upbringing, and he grows into a rebellious hot-head who spends time picking up women and brawling in bars. It's clear that the time-travel plot device was just an excuse to replace the classic characters with totally new personalities. The deep, intellectual camaraderie of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy was simply too alienating for modern audiences (or, maybe, too hard for these writers?), so just replace it with something more accessible: dashing action heroes who fight big, snarling bad guys with lasers and fistfights. None of the characters resemble their namesakes. James T. Kirk is now a reckless deadbeat, stowing away aboard the Enterprise and provoking fights with superior officers. Spock, once the famous logician, is the most emotionally unstable character in the film. Uhura is rewritten to be more abrasive, and given a much more prominent role. I guess they were going for ""girl power"" with this, but what's the point when ultimately she's nothing more than a love interest for Spock? Yes, Spock and Uhura are romantically involved, and they have a make-out scene. Are you sure Michael Bay didn't direct this?<br/><br/>Why does this film consider logic its enemy? Even a modicum of thought liquefies the plot. Black holes send ships back in time when the story needs them to, and then behave normally when it doesn't. Sulu claims he has studied fencing, yet when the time comes to fight, he pulls out a katana. I'm not against replacing Sulu's classic rapier, but for Roddenberry's sake, you don't fence with a KATANA! Nero's vessel is supposed to be a ""mining ship,"" and yet it's more heavily armed than the entire Federation fleet combined! Why does Nero have to drill into a planet's core before using his red matter? A black hole will be just as devastating on the planet's surface! Why does Nero's hundred-mile long drilling cable have to be fully extended to function? Is it just so we can have Kirk and company dive those hundred miles through the atmosphere to disable the drill? Why must spectacle come at the expense of logic? Can't a scene be gripping AND make sense simultaneously? Classic Trek could do it! What's this film's excuse?<br/><br/>Obviously Paramount wanted to make a ""Star Trek"" movie because they knew the title came with a pre-established fanbase. But if you're not going to adhere to ""Star Trek"" standards, why bother? You'll end up not only alienating the old-school fans, but enraging them when they see how much you've befouled the series they've loved for so many years. And the newcomers who aren't familiar with Trek won't be attracted by the brand name, because it's meaningless to them. Don't bother bringing ""Star Trek"" into this at all; just launch a new IP! Call it ""Black Hole Burnout: Episode I"" or something, and then you can do whatever you want with it, without worrying about lamentations from Trekkies like me!<br/><br/>I suppose I'm expected to turn my brain off for this one. I'm not against turning my brain off in principle, but for STAR TREK I expect better. This series always took itself seriously, tackling hard questions with intelligent characters and inviting you, the viewer, to engage your brain along with them. I guess modern writers think that the only way to cater to modern audiences is to dumb the franchise down to the level of all the other big, dumb action spectacles out there. The problem is that now ""Star Trek"" is just another big, dumb action spectacle. It doesn't stand out anymore. I may as well go see what Michael Bay's cooked up instead."

It's got space battles, weird alien species, trials and tribulations, strife between the crew of the ship... everything you'd want in a Star Trek movie.

HE DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL!!!<br/><br/>ORIGINAL: was cool and fun<br/><br/>Now I see that there are three ""generations"" of fans:<br/><br/>Generation 1: TOS - the best ever none even came close. This is pure, un-pc-ified, un-soap-opera'd - the pure undistilled stuff right out of the bottle<br/><br/>Generation 2: DS9 - the politically correct fandom - banal pale and droll.<br/><br/>Generation 3: TFB - the new breed of ""scifi soap opera"" fans (scifi has become little more than soap operas in space: Big Brother meets Outer Space)<br/><br/>I understand that TFB is a new timeline and that they wanted to break away from the original TOS and start new. But this movie was all glitter and gloss - like a woman's lipstick - superficial and empty. It has no heart.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: No one will ever be able to recreate Roddenberry's masterpiece. The chemistry between the crew of TOS was palpable. (Regardless of their off-stage relations) They portrayed a crew who respected and enjoyed working around each other. At the same time they were all _the_best_of_Starfleet_!<br/><br/>So trying to re-create TOS is _impossible_. It would be like trying to re-create a Michelangelo or a VanGogh - once the original artist is gone all we have left to enjoy is what they left behind.<br/><br/>Since TFB was not created by a genius, and definitely not created by even an artist, but instead created by a studio then this new version, wrapped in the ST icon, has now become nothing but a franchise.

","I have never been so confused about a movie before. Not the plot, but my feelings for it. First of all, I have been a fan of Star Trek since 1973, when I first saw the reruns. I read the books, build the models, etc. I enjoyed the show because of the stories, characters and technology. This movie, I enjoyed because of the characters. A new version of Kirk, a sort of new version of Spock, and McCoy are awesome. And for the most part, the rest of the cast were good too. Scotty needs some work, as does Chekov's accent. Sulu is good, and Uhura is hot but I will not say anything else about her for spoiler reasons(and the fact that I really hate what they did). But they were always rather minor characters in TOS anyway. The story makes sense most of the time, and sets up a new version of the Trek Universe which should be fun to explore. And the New Big E looks great, from the outside. But, the STYLE of the movie bothers me. From horrible set design(the ship looks like a refinery) to annoying lens flair, shaking cameras, and bad science. The interior views of the Enterprise just don't make sense, they would never fit into the ship and leave room for such things as crew quarters or science labs. The original and its sequels took great pains to make thing believable. This movie flushes those ideas down a very large water pipe. And why the lens flairs and shaky cameras? Sure they show a style, but the style sucks!! There are times when the entire frame is white! Are the CGI images so bad that you have to shake the camera to hide that fact? I am sure I will see this movie at least one more time. If for no other reason that to decide if I really like it, or I just enjoy it as a movie, and not Star Trek."

If Pine was playing the role for laughs, bumbling around like Robert Hegyes after a wild night at Red Lobster, then he succeeded. There was about as much life in his performance as a bad rerun of ""The Crotch Chronicles."" But, I digress.<br/><br/>Or do I? Can someone tell me what Oz Perkins is doing in this film? Heck, while we're at it, why don't we cast ""Sloppy Ivan"" French in the role of the hunky alien? Villain-wise, I was not buying this Wookie claptrap. They should have signed Bull the bailiff from ""Night Court"" instead: ""I could'a been a contenda'"".<br/><br/>On the positive side, no one can draw the most out of rabblerousers like Solomon Merasty quite like director J.J.

Michael Straczynski counter-proposed that very idea when he turned down joining the writing staff on Enterprise, Battlestar Galactica would be another example. But that's not what this does. It actually has to go and destroy its (future) history before it can exist. Wipe it out of existence.

I like how he brought Spock to life and took him in another direction than I thought they would go. Karl Urban/Leonard McCoy did a really good job. Unlike the actors above I've seen a few of Urban's films and he's a good actor. Leonard Nimoy/Spock what else can you say but fantastic.

The director (Abrams) tuned the editing in such a precise way that simply pausing for a commercial break can literally affect the way your brain processes this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Longer Review: The truth is, even as a ""prolific reviewer"" here on the IMDb, I have stopped judging movies based on the moments of high emotion (max endorphin production) that a film generates because so many modern movies rely more on SFX and CGI than they do on writing, acting, direction, connection.<br/><br/>There are two distinct audiences for this film and any proper review MUST make that clear.<br/><br/>The first is a younger audience that did not grow up with the series. For them this is a first-rate action flick but truthfully 90% of the raw joy of the film (the nostalgic turbo-charged script) will be over their heads.<br/><br/>And then there is the rest of us. If you are fan of the original series, this is the single movie (of them all) that truly rewards your patience and gives you much-deserved payback.<br/><br/>There are dozens of ""hits"" in the film that make you smile inside. Sometimes you even smile outside. My favorite is at the close when Kirk offers to ""assist"" the villain that destroyed his father and Spock's mother after opening a black hole to consume him (whatta script!). <br/><br/>Spock looks perturbed and asks Kirk why?? Kirk says that LOGICALLY offering help to the enemy might help mend relations. ""I thought you would approve?"" says Kirk. ""Not really,"" says Spock, deadpan.<br/><br/>Spectacular movie."
"byrann_gowan","8","7","12","18 February 2012"," Abrams has boldly done what no man has done before
","And that is reinventing the Star Trek franchise, and giving it new life.<br/><br/>Supposedly, according to some people's opinions, this tells of the early days of Kirk and Spock as if it is an origins story of Kirk and Spock. It could be taken this way. I, however, prefer to look at it actually as a continuation of the old franchise for reasons I will talk about later.<br/><br/>Let me just say that everyone that was a part of this film deserves a round of applause. The acting and the behind the scenes work (all of it) was spot on, and I couldn't find any reason to not give this film a 10/10.<br/><br/>Let me talk about the acting, because, while I could go on and on about the action scenes and the special effects, it's really the acting that stood out in this. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto: I can imagine what it's like for you guys to take on enormous roles as Kirk and Spock. Great job, you guys; you have made new fans of the series, and the old fans are proud of you guys.<br/><br/>There are actually quite a lot of well-known actors and actresses here, but that doesn't deter the film, as it does in other films. We have John Cho playing helmsman Hikaru Sulu; Ben Cross as Spock's father, Sarek; Bruce Greenwood as USS Commanding Officer Pike; Simon Pegg as Chief Engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scot; Winona Ryder as Spock's mother Amanda Greyson; Zoe Saldana as Chief Communications Officer Uhura; Karl Urban as Chief Medical Officer McCoy; Anton Yelchin as USS Navigator and security/tactical officer Chekov; Eric Bana as Captain Nero; And... get ready, because a bomb is coming... Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime! That's right! Leonard Nimoy! Quinto must have been shaking in his boots at the thought of portraying Spock in front of Spock (literally!)! I know I would have. A great job to everyone here; you all did your job well.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action, but before that happens, we see a little bit of back story to the Spock and Kirk characters, and because we get to know them, we start to care about them.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great film that gives more life to a classic series with humour, action, a great story, great acting, and some very pleasing special effects. This will please the usual Trekkie fan, and perhaps gain new ones. A solid 10/10 for me."
"davydteather","10","7","12","10 July 2011"," The best Star Trek movie I have seen in years,
","This is a very awesome, superb movie. This movie has really good humour, outstanding cast and a very good plot. It has the characters from the original Star Trek T.V. show and the films containing the original crew. But the cast is different. What sets this film apart from the other films and the original T.V. show is that this film takes place is an alternate time-line and time travel is a big theme in this film. It also has a back story on the characters and how they became who they are, namely James T. Kirk, Spock and Dr. Bones McCoy. You see James T. Kirk as an arrogant, haughty, egotistical, rude, self-centred and womanizing dirt bag and before he became captain of the enterprise. You see Spock from his childhood to his time in Starfleet academy. And hands off to Eric Bana as the main bad guy. I would recommend this movie to any Star Trek fan out there. You will not be disappointed. It is worth a watch and time well spent."

","I didn't even know about this movie, I had sort of read media about it, but I thought it was to be a series. Well, caught the movie on TV, seen it 5 times, it is extraordinary. The storyline, the filming, the acting, what a treat, for any Star Trek fan it is a well made delight. Every character is outlined or drawn with care and class, specially Bones and Spock, but everyone: Uhura (she had a thing for Spock!!!, great!!!), Scotty (there'd be whales in here captain!), Chekov (ver are di nucliar wessels?), Zulu (master navigator), make feel like a kid again. But yes oh yes, who could fill the shoes of the biggest captain ever?, wow, what a performance, Will Shatner must be proud, he made James T. Kirk, and now it is a trademark, good for Chris Pine, for who else would stare into the camera, look at you dead in the eye from the film screen (or TV) and say: ""BULLSHIT!"". Goosebumps!"
"gene_jr","1","34","81","10 May 2009"," Are you kidding me?
","Once again it's was a ""futile"" attempt from J. J. Abrams getting some people to ""role play"" a Star Trek adventure then an actual Star Trek movie. They were not even a pale imitation of the original crew. Just cheap copies and one liner quotes used that made the ""original crew"" memorable. Even some unnecessary foul language used along with some crude behavior. You will even see, look carefully, some elements thrown in from past Star Trek movies. Look at the movie poster, distorted image, sloppily done, no details or quality much less real thought. True J. J. Abrams fashion. Like a spoiled, brat child running to you saying, ""Look what I did?"" And you run and scramble around to see what was torn up in your house. The neighbors screaming at you about what he did to their dog or car or the yard. You get a clue from his production company, ""Bad Robot."" The robot sneaking around getting into things it should know better.<br/><br/>This movie is full of contradictions like no one's business as you will see. As Spock would say, ""Most distasteful"" and the greatest contradiction of all is yet to be discovered if you see this horrible flick. Something from a high school, summer project rushed to get out before the fall semester. Its full of extremes from the insult side, all in the movie. You can predict from time to time what will happen in this movie. J. J. you suck as a director, adding this movie to your failed list of projects should be more than enough for you to get a life."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","10","19","14 March 2010"," A franchise re-energised-big time!
","It's not an understatement to say that the news of a new Star Trek movie was met in equal measure by suspicion and pretty low expectations. Step forward J.J. Abrams to direct it, and many wondered while the guy behind TV series ""Lost"" and ""Mission Impossible III"" would want to dabble on hallowed sci-fi turf?. Things were further eyebrow raising when Abrams openly admitted to not having been a fan of the original show so cherished by a legion of Trekkies. Then news came of the film being a prequel, based around the Starfleet Academy and the coming together of what we know as the U.S.S. Enterprise crew. ""Ooh that will be a tough one to carry off"" said many, ""Kirk & Spock as young spunkers - surely not"" they said. Well not only did Abrams pull it off as it were, he simultaneously appeased most Trekkies whilst garnering a whole new generation of sci-fi observers. Budgeted at $140,000,000, Abrams Star Trek went on to gross Worldwide $384,953,778. Figures that, even allowing for the huge fan-base that the franchise has, show that many first timers not only went to see it - but also that they enjoyed it so much they went back for second helpings. I know I did.<br/><br/>The success of the film isn't hard to fathom, because although Abrams upped the action quota (with a number of breath taking and eye appealing sequences) he also dispensed with much of the sci-fi psycho babble that has blighted some of the previous filmic instalments in this most up and down of franchise's. Sure there's stuff in there for the discerning fan, with a time travelling revenge plot at its axis, how could there not be?, But Abrams and his writers (Roberto Orci /Alex Kurtzman) keep it simple, savvy and sexy. They smartly link to Trek lore with a crucial plot and character development featuring the Kobayashi Maru, while pain, emotional conflict and personal crisis all feature heavily. This is, one can ""logically"" say, a spiky post 9/11 Trek movie. There's even room for a romantic strand, a strand that is tender and fits the whole make-up of the piece perfectly. All of which only works because the cast are, in the main, producing great work.<br/><br/>Getting Leonard Nimoy to appear in a small, but crucial role, is nothing short of being a master-stroke. His presence keeps the all important essence of Star Trek within what is ultimately a reboot. It's like a father figure watching over proceedings, making not only the cast feel safe, but also us the viewers. The youngsters in the cast are impressive, Chris Pine (Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock) and Zoe Saldaña (Uhura) lead from the fresh faced front. While Karl Urban (Bones McCoy) and Simon Pegg (Scotty) impact with comic relief that aids instead of hinders the plot developments. Villain duties falls to Eric Bana as Romulan Captain Nero, he's a touch miffed is Nero, and Bana brings the character's vengeful pain vividly to life. While Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike adds a touch of class that he almost always seems to do.<br/><br/>This U.S.S. Enterprise has launched itself in another direction, and yes, it's boldly going where no-one has boldly gone before. It is, all told, a bona fide blockbuster with brains and balls. The like of which has sadly been missing from many a modern era summer release. Yes it's not all perfect, the odd scene could quite easily have been jettisoned, and some accents need a bit of fine tuning, but they are very minor complaints. A triumph from Abrams and his team - note the Stardate in the ships log, for this is a noteworthy moment in modern sci-fi cinema. Now comes perhaps a bigger challenge, the notoriously difficult second film... 10/10"
"merle2","1","10","19","15 December 2009"," I wanted to like this movie but....
","I love all things Star Trek don't so get me wrong. I have every one of the movies on DVD or VHS and have watched them all so many times they may soon be worn out. Let me comment on this movie.<br/><br/>I gave it all of one star mainly because of the utterly crappy camera work and the excess use of special effects. We have the MTV style of jumpy camera work and jerking from one scene to the other so fast you might lose your lunch when viewing it not even to mention the confusing overlay camera effects. The story and characters are decent but the photography destroys any attempt of the actors to make a decent movie. The other Star Treks relied mainly on the characters and the story and not confusing camera work and second rate special effects which is why I love them.<br/><br/>Sorry to say but what could have been a great movie was utterly destroyed by the director or whoever was in charge of the the photography. I will just continue to watch my old Star Treks."
"bruce-129","Null","10","19","12 May 2009"," Star Trek: Off In The Weeds
","Having watched the original series and been influenced for better by the original Star Trek and Gene Roddenberry's vision of a tolerant, rational, diverse and productive future I was very much looking forward to the new Star Trek movie.<br/><br/>The first inkling that I might have trouble with the movie was the trailers that show what looks like a pre-teenage James Tiberius Kirk driving what in the movie would be a 300 year old antique muscle car off a cliff while almost killing himself. The whole scene screamed out action, pointless image pandering, and strongly suggested a total lack of understanding of Star Trek and Kirk ... but a total lock on how to manipulate movie-going audiences with rebellious images and eye candy.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I did want to see what this new Star Trek was going to be, and I think that is the capital this movie knows it can draw on. Abrams and company bought the rights knowing that me and millions of other people will go to the movie sight unseen. I think it gave Abrams, who I think has never finished anything he has done, and certainly never done anything he has finished without interjecting time travel and alternate realities, a license to ""muck about"" with Star Trek, as if no one cares and it is his own personal property, not the worldwide icon that it is. Star Trek has survived for so long because of the vision of Roddenberry of the world in the original series.<br/><br/>To be sure, most of the Star Trek movies were made to capitalize on the branding of Star Trek, and people could hardly get enough, but no one really thought highly of the movies as part of the Star Trek world, they were nostalgic moments that brought together actors who were too old to be what they were in these movies with overblown plots about existential threats to civilized life in the universe.<br/><br/>Most of the movies completely missed the point of Star Trek, that being the seeking and exploration of new life and new civilizations. Star Trek was at its best as an adventure show that was usually at its heart subversive with some critical comment about our own Earth's history. The movies mostly missed this.<br/><br/>This new movie is slick, and it has all the images strong and intense to catch people's eyes, and it did catch mine. On the good side there is a new crew that are younger and more believable to be crewing a Star Ship for the United Federation of Planets. The catch to this is that these are all Roddenberry's inventions, and they were bought to get viewers in the door, not to honor or extend the Star Trek legacy.<br/><br/>I have to say that the whole new crew is great. Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Scotty, Bones, Chekov, Sulu ... they all did great jobs and looked their parts. It was a lot of fun to see just a small glimpse that could have been with a real Star Trek movie instead of the exploitative marketing that some Hollywood focus group told movie investors how not to lose money in.<br/><br/>The idea of ""disrespectfully"" blowing away all of Star Trek history and lore could have worked or been a necessary device if there was a greater good to be obtained from it, but there was really no point to do all of that for a cheap and simpleminded script that they settled on here.<br/><br/>There was good music as well, the new Star Trek theme wonderfully caught the sense of wonder and awe of what must be out there in the universe for us to encounter and see.<br/><br/>While seeing the movie the pace and visual images unfold and move on through this story with its own momentum at warp speed, the problem with this movie, and Hollywood in general is that most often they assemble the pieces of a movie they think people will see, and the demographics they hope to rope in to sell tickets to, and the mechanically construct a product that while it will appeal to a mass market has no understanding of how to have a heart, or in this case how to be Star Trek.<br/><br/>The fun in watching this movie is undeniable, but the sadness in pondering it's failures and the disrespect it showed to the original creators and the fans of Star Trek who continually hope for more is what make the movie an ultimate failure.<br/><br/>2/10"
"badoli","5","23","52","12 May 2009"," If you want rather mindless action, you're right. If you like Star Trek and/or logic, search elsewhere.
","J.J. Abrahams tries to relaunch the Star Trek franchise and that by itself is a good idea. Yet the realization went wrong in quite some ways.<br/><br/>Lets start with what is good: The special effects are the most impressing about this movie. Where as this sounds like a compliment, it's actually already quite a statement, as from here on everything goes down. As J.J. tried to ""renew"" the whole thing, he threw the old characters partly over board. The closest reincarnation from my point of view is Karl Urban as Doc ""Bones"" McCoy, which reminds quite often to the real one. On second place is Zachary Quinto's Spock, John Cho's Sulu and Anton Yelchin's Chekov, which are all very likable reminiscences of the originals.<br/><br/>Kirk, Uhura and Scotty on the other hand turn pale in comparison. Chris Pine overacts the whole ""cool American""-stereotype hitting on everything with long hair and starting a fight whenever drunk. William Shatner had much more class than him. Zoe Saldana is just average in everything and barely strikes me as the ""communication queen"". And Scotty? Oh, please, forget Scotty in this one. Simon Pegg is annoying throughout the movie by barking his one-liners and failing as a comical relief. A pity, as he was much funnier in ""How to Lose Friends"". All in all i felt that the motivations of some of the protagonists were less than comprehensible.<br/><br/>The worst though is the screenplay. The story itself is okay, yet the details just ruin every entertainment to be had. Spock himself would have had a hard time watching this illogical mess. Okay, you say action movies don't have to be logical, yet still it hits my personal limit to be entertaining. This is not helped by heavy overuse of shaky camera. It seems that nowadays when something is shaky and far from comprehension, thats action! No, it isn't, thats just slack directors work. Aliens, Terminator, Die Hard ... all great action flicks much without that kind of modern cinematic prestidigitation.<br/><br/>So to summarize: If you like action and don't want to think, go for it. Yet this is not what Star Trek was about and that's sad. I wouldn't go so far to call myself a Trekkie, yet i like the old ones well enough to see that in writing quality this isn't near the real thing. And i don't think it was necessary to rewrite major events of the Star Trek universe to pull it off. We have seen a great relaunch of Batman without hurting it's existing universe, so i assumed that it should be possible to repeat the same with Star Trek. I was left disappointed."
"changmoh","8","12","24","1 May 2009"," A Brand New Beginning For Trekkies
","Let's face it, the last installment, ""Star Trek Nemesis"" (2002), was the last nail in the coffin of the tired sci-fi franchise. Since then, most Trekkies have kissed it goodbye. Now, however, J.J. Abrams has boldly taken the franchise back to where many other franchises have been before - into Reboot territory. With it, we have promises of more outer space capers with the 'new' USS Enterprise and its crew. And if that does not excite the legions of Trekkies all over the world, I don't know what will...<br/><br/>This movie is an account of the birth of James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), his wild, rebellious childhood, his recruitment into the Starfleet Academy and his first trip on board the spanking new USS Enterprise under Capt Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Sure, we get to meet the other crew members, namely Spock (Zachary Quinto), troubled half-human, half-Vulcan, and members of his family; the reluctant doctor Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban); the sexy linguist Uhura (Zoe Saldana), the gungho Sulu (John Cho) and a 17-year-old Russian brain named Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Later, Scotty (Simon Pegg) comes aboard as chief engineer - and 'the gang's all here!' The villain is the vengeful Romulan Nero (played with gusto by Eric Bana) - and there are lots of twists and surprises. These include a love interest for the 'emotion-deficit' Spook and an appearance by a famous original member of the Star Trek cast.<br/><br/>Director Abrams brings intelligence, inventiveness and definitely, a new beginning to the franchise. He is mindful of its traditions, its history and its nostalgic appeal - and he treats them with reverence. Together with his writers (Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) he fleshes out Gene Roddenberry's iconic young characters, including the USS Enterprise, and gives them a 'history'. As such, we get to sympathize with them.<br/><br/>More importantly, he understands that the franchise is about fantasy and imagination - and he energizes the prequel with state-of-the-art special effects, thrills and stunts (from Industrial Light + Magic). Indeed, Abrams brings new meaning to the famous phrase ""Beam me up, Scotty!"" when Chekov does it when his subjects are in motion. Other wonders include a time-travel subplot but it is more confusing than awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>However, it is the young and vibrant cast that help to make the movie work. Pine and Quinto (who plays Sylar on TV's ""Heroes"") are ideal as leads in this space opera - and the others like Urban, Saldana, Cho and Yelchin not only look like their original players, they also provide humor and a few laughs as well.<br/><br/>It's time to boldly go back to the cinema for new Star Trek thrills, folks."
"nicholls905-280-546911","8","6","10","8 September 2019"," Solid Reboot
","I have to say I was shocked how well they twisted a simple reboot into the core franchise storyline. I wasn't a huge fan of the lense flashing filmmaking style. This has an interesting film and finally unleashes a budget worthy of the franchise. I expected a dud, but this film delivers and offers a few twists along the way."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","4","6","10","10 May 2013"," Galaxy Quest was infinitely superior
","Apparently this is teenage Star Trek, in which the juvenile delinquents take over the starship ""Enterprise""....<br/><br/>I am not a particular ""Star Trek"" fan - my main knowledge of the series was gained by encountering various tie-in novels while devouring the science fiction section of my local library, although I've probably seen half a dozen repeated episodes of the original TV series over the years and watched (and disliked) some of the earlier films when they first came out -- and I know very little about the subsequent spin-off series. All of which goes to say that I didn't have a vast amount of emotional investment to be overthrown when watching this film. I simply remembered that it got good reviews when it first came out, that I'd intended to watch it at the time but never got round to it, and that it might be a good idea to have a look at it now in case I actually wanted to watch the forthcoming sequel.<br/><br/>I was at least expecting decent entertainment...<br/><br/>This film is simply one long string of modern action-movie cliché from start to end, with frenetic camera-work, constant shoot-em-ups and/or punch-em-ups, fights over multi-level platforms (haven't I just seen this same sequence shoe-horned into ""The Hobbit""?), supposedly emotional scenes that leave me absolutely untouched and not a little irked at the intended manipulation, and the insistence that any action marginally more intelligent than charging head-to-head with vastly more powerful baddies and hoping for a miracle is simply arrant cowardice. All of which would be bad enough (plus the truly lazy use of time-travel as a deus ex machina for some hand-waving technology), but which is accelerated past the stage of merely being bad science fiction and into the stage of being deeply annoying by the teenage cast.<br/><br/>Presumably this was an attempt to win the vital Young Adult (16-24) market -- however, the scenario where a bunch of space cadets are sent out to save the universe because, whoops, the rest of the navy isn't in port yet, really doesn't hold water. Let alone the scenario where all the famous characters just happen to be the same age and end up on the same ship -- funny, that -- so that the series can be 'rebooted' with a complete cast of photogenic crew members under the age of twenty-two. I may not know much about Star Trek history, but I do have some idea of naval organisation and the workings of seniority! As for Kirk, he is unbelievably annoying -- I felt like cheering when Spock had him thrown off the bridge and off the ship after behaviour that should have got him cashiered. The idea that this delinquent stowaway cadet could commit mutiny via grossly insulting his superior officer and be rewarded for it by appointing himself captain is not only ludicrous but offensive to the intelligence of the viewer: as another reviewer points out, even Dr McCoy was senior to Kirk at that point.<br/><br/>What is -- or should be -- deeply worrying is that ""Galaxy Quest"", written as a deliberate ""Star Trek"" spoof, is actually infinitely more effective as straight science fiction than this 'reboot' is. It is perhaps unsurprising that it is also much funnier (what jokes exist in this film tend to fail badly), but the producers should be seriously concerned that the so-called spoof is also far more emotionally involving, more heroic, more exciting, and more scientifically coherent. You actually care about what happens to that crew of washed-up actors and hapless aliens: they face real challenges, evolve real relationships and manage to eat their cake and have it while poking gentle fun at the nerds who ultimately help save the day.<br/><br/>As for this film -- well, I liked most of Spock and what little we saw of McCoy, hated Kirk, found the other 'canon' crew members pretty ridiculous and thought the plot was detestably silly. Again, as another reviewer says, you could plausibly have made it an 'origins' story for Kirk alone (though the character would still have been a complete pain in the neck), but attempting to assemble a complete juvenile version of the crew really stretches credibility. It wasn't just a bad blockbuster: it was a blockbuster that I deeply resented seeing."

I can only hope to get onto such a project one day. I lean more towards scifi movies anyway like the Matrix and Lord of the Rings but by far the most surprising film of 2009 and beyond was this movie.

"grandascent","Null","6","10","4 March 2011"," I don't think there is a word in Klingon to describe how bad this is.
","What do you get when you mix the Original Star Trek with Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and J. J. Abrams? An incoherent mess of a movie. Highly resembling the manic chaos that is the Michael Bay, Transformer movies.<br/><br/>The first and obvious thing that is notable about this film is the absolute train wreck visuals. This film features: slanted angles, shaky-cam, light glares, strobing lights and loud very music. It's all used to make things appear more fast-paced and exciting but it makes the whole movie feel a lot less distinct and memorable. It includes the kind of quick editing which misses out all the intermittent scenes which would make the movie flow as a whole. The movie loves to get painfully close to people's faces to the point where it feels like an invasion of privacy.<br/><br/>The second thing to draw would be the awful plot and writing, courtesy of the dumb and dumber pair of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. With such unbelievable lines as ""a supernova that threatens the entire galaxy"" it becomes clear that these two think the audience is as dumb as they are. Once against the Earth is in danger from some bold megalomaniac person from the Romulan empire. Any Star Trek fan will instantly recognise this as the plot from the last movie, Star Trek Nemesis. So not content from trying to rip-off some of the plot from one of the worst Star Trek movies up until this one, what else can they steal? Well it's been noted already by many at how this movie seems to heavily resemble the Star Wars franchise. More specifically; A New Hope. But where A New Hope had groundbreaking special effects. With unique aspects interwoven to capture people's imagination, like the force. This movie has nada.<br/><br/>Onto the characters we have James.T.Kirk; a roguish, womanising, law-breaking, fun-times kinda guy who cleans up his act by the end of the movie. Yep his character is reduced to Tony Stark from Iron Man(2008). But where you have the quick thinking and smooth charm of Robert Downey Jr to back up that character. We get a rather flat Chris Pine for a Kirk. John Cho from Harold & Kumar fame plays Mr Sulu but lacks the extravagant voice to match George Takei's original interpretation. Instead Sulu is reduced to being the guy who can swing a sword and do cool Asian martial arts. Anton Yelchin's Chekov has some pretty funny and unconvincing sounding Russian accent here, but he fills the role adequately. Zoe Zadana plays a rather bitchy Uhura who is made a tacked-on love interest. Simon Pegg pulls of the most lively and wonderful performance as Scotty. He carries an enthusiasm for the situation and the general surroundings which make it seem all the more believable that he loves his craft. Zachary Quinto plays a fairly good Spock who is far more emotional than Leonard Nimoy's own Spock. But I was a little disappointed with the lack of famous Spock eyebrow raising which always happened to make him seem quite human but also perplexed at the same time. Quinto's voice just doesn't hold that cold, rigid firmness that Vulcans and Spock in particular, are noted for. Carl Urban is pretty good as Bones, he really makes it believable that he and Jim are good friends. His franticness really make his character the most believable in the role of a medical officer. Eric Bana plays Nero who just feels like nothing more than a stomping angry figure then a complex and clever villain that Trek has been known for. Lastly there is Leonard Nimoy who is the only one of the Original series cast to reprise their role in this picture and yet he feels rather underused. In fact his dialogue is pretty bad and he cobbles such eye-rolling sentiments as ""destiny"" in the scenes which are a clear sort of pass-the-torch moments. A far more uninvolved Spock which is counterintuitive to the old stubborn ambassador who enters any and all situations to achieve his ambitious but well-thought ends.<br/><br/>This is a bad movie, not because it loses its adherence to the old Trek. After all the old Star Trek has produced its own fill of bad movies. No the movie is bad because it lacks intelligence, cohesion, good characters and memorable acting on the whole.<br/><br/>Perhaps next time, instead of trying to copy elements for the most widest and blandest adaptation. They should try to look at all the good Star Trek series and moments. To try bring about what was actually unique and special about the franchise. Rather than reduce it to this stupid, tumble-heap of a movie mess."

","WOW!!!! Since I am old enough to have seen the original Star Trek TV series and have seen every Star Trek movie multiple times, this prequel was AWESOME!!!! The passion of the characters was captured magnificently by the young cast. Leonard Nimoy's appearance as Spock Prime was a nice tribute to the original series. This movie moves at an almost breathtaking pace, with enough action to satisfy all. I enjoyed this movie more than any other entry except for First Contact. Time travel is one link to these two films, and the famous line ""I have been, and always will be, your friend."" gives a nod to Wrath of Khan if memory serves.

","Star Trek <br/><br/>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to fight a galactic battle in the middle of space?...Well now you can! I am of course talking about the highly popular TV programme that has recently been turned into a film, very popular amongst Sci-fi extremists. Although 'Star Trek' the TV series doesn't appeal to me, being a little bit to serious for me, the film gave me time away from everyday life to give me a space experience, however it did not convince me in to joining the Trekkie way. It opens with a tense space battle between captain Kirk and the evil aliens to gain revenge for future occurrences. At the time of the battle 'James T. Kirk' was in the middle of being born, while his heroic farther sacrifices his life for the good of the fleeing crew and his family. This plays into the Sci-fi genre by being set in space with aliens and high tech spaceships, comparing with 'Star Wars' which boosted the Sci-fi genres into public appeal. My review on this film is that if you are a Trekie or not a Trekie this film will appeal to you, although it is not a wow film, it will go down as one of the best Sci-fi movies."
"kulpatron1","3","6","10","1 January 2010"," Let's go back in time and re-do this flick.
","After a (sadly) negative reaction to my first viewing (from a DVD), I've watched this flick a dozen times since -- partly in an attempt to ""mind-meld"" with this concept, and partly to figure it out. Here are some ""plusses"" and ""minusses."" Remember, as a Trekker, I'm considered ""converted."" THIS was a film I WANTED to like, and I worked really hard to do so. But there is one major flaw to this whole scheme, which I'll address at the end.<br/><br/>""Minus"": The story: This Star Trek story fell victim to the mistaken conception that you can do almost anything in sci-fi fantasy. Points central to the action, such as the whys and whatfors of ""red matter,"" went unexplained. And in some cases, we're left to assume things. Did Spock actually take back the red stuff? Who knows? It's difficult to follow a fast-moving story when something stops you cold.<br/><br/>""Plus"": This version of the Enterprise actually captured the spirit of the TV ship without looking dated. Great job pulling that off! <br/><br/>""Minus"": When the Romulan ship first appears, it looks more like a giant crawdad (front end) silhouette. I really didn't know what it was -- it did not look like a ship, but more like a monster.<br/><br/>It's one thing to portray long dead figures (like Lincoln) . . . quite another to portray characters already defined by actors well within the bounds of recent memories.<br/><br/>""Plus"": Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. McCoy was superb, at least for this Trekker. A+. Likewise, Chekov's and Scotty's actors get a ""B+"" and ""B"", respectively. These folks worked at it.<br/><br/>""Minus"": This new ""James T. Kirk"" missed the mark, as did ""Spock."" While both bore resemblances to the original actors, neither pulled them off -- especially Kirk (Chris Pine.) Spock sounded more like a nasal nerd I grew up with back when the TV series aired, the force of his logic diluted with that whiny voice. ""D"" for Kirk, ""C-"" for Spock. (Kirk would have merited an ""F"", but for one scene when he shouted ""Bones."" I then felt the ""Shatneresque"" Kirk, hence, the essence of the original series.) <br/><br/>""Minus"": Did anyone notice that Uhura seemed to mispronounce her own name in the beginning, calling herself ""U-hor-a?"" I actually missed the ""Uhura"" connection there. She's a hot chick -- but she bore little resemblance to Nichols, either physically or emotionally.<br/><br/>""Minus"": While the movie was intentionally energetic and ""fast-paced"", the story moved faster than I could absorb it.<br/><br/>""Plus"": In what may well be the greatest Star Trek ""shoot-em-up"" scene ever, seeing the Enterprise with its phasers blasting full bore, and its crew at their helms, really punched up the power of that vessel.<br/><br/>""Minus"": Too many homages. I already saw ""Tech Sergeant Chen"" struggle to beam up his commander in ""Galaxy Quest"", and a smaller beast attacked by a larger critter as they pursued our heroes in ""Star Wars 1"". And the scene whereby Kirk shuttles past the Enterprise pales in comparison to that in ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" I want original stuff, as these scenes once were....get better writers. I don't care how ""ingenius"" the producers consider themselves to be, (as per the DVD commentary.) <br/><br/>Today's ""video game"" youngsters, not saddled with pre-conceived impressions as to the characters, may well enjoy this movie. But I got the impression that those of us who helped support and build that entire franchise -- from day one -- were thrown into the trash. After all, by changing everyone's ""destinies"" in this flick, they've wiped out the entire history of every single Star Trek adventure ever filmed, written about, or drawn. Throw away those compilations, folks. In essence, the ""Trouble with Tribbles"" never happened.<br/><br/>The Star Trek past has been reduced to fiction, which, I guess, is what Star Trek really is. Some of us really didn't want to see Star Trek that way."

","When I first heard Sylar would become Spock, I was already keen to see this movie. And it is indeed a very sticky bit of popcorn - a tasty snack with no food value at all.<br/><br/>One of the strange beauties of this film is that it will certainly fail as a DVD seller because the plot is execrable. As an entertainment device, it holds up for an hour or so - but it could not possibly survive multiple viewings. Quite an inversion from the norm.<br/><br/>Most science fiction is a crucible for social politics, and this alternate Star Trek fares well here. Beyond the great visuals and jaunty dialogue, selected characters have a vague inner life and back story. The original Trek cannon is adhered to on occasion, and this provides some backbone though by the end of the film even Salman Rushdie would be seeking less magic realism.<br/><br/>Due to the pure entertainment value the film delivers, this will probably spawn a franchise - but only if the plot is not taken from scrawlings on the lavatory at Walmart."

","(Originally submitted on May 11, 2009) <br/><br/>I am not a Trekkie. I hate just about anything related to Star Trek, except the clever Part IV and the iconic The Wrath of Khan. I went to check this movie out because I was mildly impressed with the trailer, considering J.J. Abrams ""salvaged"" Mission: Impossible after that garbage of a first sequel.<br/><br/>I don't expect anything out of the ordinary in terms of storytelling. I go to the movies to escape pains of the real-life world temporarily, especially in terrible economic times. The story turns out to be a standard revenge yarn with the villains taken right out of Final Fantasy video games. Yawn.<br/><br/>And J.J. Abrams went way, way overboard with shaky and blinding cinematography. Every damn scene is filled to the brim with lens glare for...cool and dramatic effect. So what, it doesn't make an organic feeling. Only a few film directors know how to use lens glare to proper visually compelling effect in aesthetics -- and sparingly. Mr. Abrams' fetish for ""moar"" lens glare, even digitalized in some F/X shots, is nuts. Worse than John McTiernan. Extremely irritating for a viewer who know BS when he sees it. Slim down on lens glare coke snorting, please.<br/><br/>The characters are all cardboard cutouts of the better, more fleshed-out original characters played by ""seasoned"" actors. Even the amazingly ""GQ"" handsome actor Chris Pine looks and acts like a smug p-word in this movie. The movie bristles with barely concealed sarcasm in self-consciousness that doesn't appear to enhance or serve the story. J.J. Abrams made this movie to elevate Star Trek to ""pop culture coolness"" while ostensibly mocking the fans of the original with the attitude of the infamous William Shatner SNL skit beseeching the hard-core fans to get a life. The dumb, average audience nods in agreement while consuming buttered popcorn and sugar-loaded soda.<br/><br/>Star Trek re-boot was made not as a passion, but strictly to make megabucks at the box office. J.J. Abrams and company can roll in the dough and laugh. They can do anything to ruin Star Trek legacy by rendering it kitsch with the hot ""Abercromie & Fitch"" actors and latest F/X technology plus formula 1-2-3 script and directorial excess piling on enough lens glare to blind the audiences temporarily.<br/><br/>A visually, aesthetically and figuratively lame movie overall. And Abrams needs to scale down lens glare in his next movie. Metaphor of a holographic cocaine on film.<br/><br/>* out of 4"

","I am in a state of shock. For most of the film I felt it did a good job of capturing the things that made Star Trek great: good science fiction, human characters that had a sense of humor, a sense of wonder. The actors, particularly those playing Kirk, McCoy and Spock, did a great job of capturing the essence of the characters. Then, the ending. My companions and I tried to grasp the reality of what we had just seen...a total wipe-out of Trek history. We were sure the original time-line was going to be restored at the end of the film, but no. Its clear that this film was meant to be the start of a money making reboot of the brand. That's the only thing that explains the ending...not to mention the absurd relationship between Uhuru and Spock. How can they make Uhuru, an officer and member of the bridge crew, into booty call for a Vulcan? Frankly, as a fan who watched Star Trek from the first night the show was on the air, I feel betrayed. Very sad. Glad I have my own copies of the original movies and can ignore this one. I won't be recommending it to anyone."

","Cocktail party chat on Mission Impossible III might, at very worst, label you mainstream. But mention 'trekkie' interests and the ghetto of a solitary corner awaits, as you vainly gaze across the watered-down punch for a glimmer of like-minded weirdos.<br/><br/>Unless pointy ears and anoraks are your thing, admitting you go to the latest Star Trek movie was generally a mistake. This, the studios, in the name of all that is financially Good and Great, wish to save us from. Star Trek must be lifted from its intergalactic backwater and placed squarely in the multi-million dollar sound-bite. Now, suitably high-concept, this eleventh incarnation from the media franchise becomes the respectable selection from a dizzying array of multiplex excess.<br/><br/>What Christopher Nolan (and then Heath Ledger) did for Batman, surely a blank cheque and a few good actors can do for Captain Kirk and his motley crew. That, at least, seems the intention. How well does it pan out?<br/><br/>Our new Star Trek has a less cult muppets and more action heroes. Chris Pine almost morphs the face of William Shatner's original and the captain of the 4th TV series. Leonard Nimoy cameos as aging Spock as we are introduced to the newer model. Simon Pegg (Scotty), Winona Ryder (Spock's mum) and Zoe Saldana (Uhuru) are all a joy to watch. <br/><br/>To establish itself as authoritative (a la Batman Begins), this movie is the prequel, long ago envisaged by creator Gene Roddenberry, and cancelled after its premature birth in the ham-fisted TV 'Enterprise' series. We follow Kirk from his earliest days, and also see young Spock grow up. It is an enormous balancing act, executed with a tremendous price tag (more than any previous Star Trek film) and has to tick many boxes for die-hard fans as well as reaching out to new audiences.<br/><br/>Our film opens a few minutes before Kirk is born. During a massive battle, he is shuttled out of harm's way, a cacophony of explosions submerged by sympathetic orchestra strains. He grows up the pretty boy-next-door with a wild streak. A sort of James Dean with a brain. Or, ""the only genius repeat-offender in the Mid-West."" After the most taxing training that Hollywood can devise, he becomes a hardened fighter still in touch with his humanity.<br/><br/>There are nice touches to look out for. Spock becomes 'emotionally compromised.' We see passion and a moist eye from the lovely Uhuru; and futurescapes glimpsed all too briefly in an average shot length of under five seconds.<br/><br/>As summer blockbusters go, Star Trek deserves to do well. But I would like to have seen some of the groundbreaking moral subtlety for which the original series – famed for the first on screen inter-racial kiss – garnered high regard among many. One has to search for any underlying dynamic at all. At best, it is the story of brave and fearless white Americans – with the addition of a Russian, a Scot, and a token black woman – facing a terrorist-style enemy (rogue Romulans) that has an unfounded grudge, formidable strike power, and no logical way of being defeated. (Wow! That's not too hard to follow!) Add familiar tropes about saving mankind, and western 'compassion' (before blowing someone up). Then fights between representatives of good and evil on a high ledge somewhere, and it starts looking depressingly derivative. Star Trek here relies on action scenes styled to Tom Cruise completing another impossible mission. But, sadly, Pine lacks Cruise charisma – or anyone else's for that matter. And, while MI-III director Abrams was probably a wise choice, the result is more a step in the right direction than a satisfying overall product.<br/><br/>We can unashamedly leave our pointy bits at home to watch this film in the company of regular cinema-goers. But, rather than ground-breaking fare, it only takes us to the happy-land of unthinking entertainment. Its catchline: 'The Future Begins' came up on the screen only moments after the trailer for the new Terminator, for which I am assured, 'The End Begins.' Seems all you need these days to defeat an undefeatable assassin is a good starter line. May the White House take note. Though not, perhaps, feeling impelled to boldly go too boldly."

((( and how the hell does it have an 8.0 rating here on IMDb, didn't any of the people who saw this go to science class either?<br/><br/>Okay, the movie is about a renegade Romulan Captain named Nero who travels back in time 80 years just to get revenge on Ambassador Spock for failing to save his home planet in the future. Apparently Ambassador Spock was going to stop the Romulan sun from going Super Nova by injecting it with something called red matter that would implode their sun and created a artificial black hole. Did it not occur to anyone that if you implode a star and create a black hole, which the Black Hole created would also destroy the Romulan home planet? So either way the planet would've been destroyed. And why doesn't Nero ever go to his home planet and warn them about the coming future catastrophe, No, instead he just floats around in space for 25 years doing nothing as he is waiting for Spock to arrive. This is just stupid. Then J.J.Abrams has Nero destroy the planet Vulcan, thus destroying 50 years worth of canonized Star Trek movies and television shows (all of which involve planet Vulcan). And what's up with those product placement ads.. come on man, this is Star Trek, 300 years in the future and people are still using Nokia phones, drinking Budweiser, and driving Chevrolets..

I know that it was meant for people who didn't like Star Trek and I'm sure it appealed to people who just wanted a shoot 'em up.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it has a poor story, which is consistent with most movies today, including the re-makes that make changes for the sake of changes. This story tries to tie people and events together with annoying lights. (Ask me about Super 8.) I could imagine that California was suffering from rolling blackouts during the filming of this blockbuster of luminary proportions.<br/><br/>The action could be interesting, but isn't. The gratuitous sex scene is included. The special effects aren't that special. The prosthetics were replaced with tattoos. Jar Jar Bink's annoying cousin was even included at an icy outpost.<br/><br/>The ""Is the parking brake on?"" scene is ridiculous and nearly a take-off of the scene in Galaxy Quest where Tommy first takes control of the helm of the real ship. It's supposed to be funny like that scene was, but it's not. In fact, none of the funny stuff is funny and the dramatic scenes are without personality. The witty commentary is witless.<br/><br/>So, we're left with a movie that is loosely based on a cult television series, trying to explain many things but leaving me to not care.

It's the writers I object to for creating an alternate timeline without laying any proper foundation for it. And then again, who is gonna believe 20th century motorcycles in the late 23rd century, or creating a Spock with a love interest or killing off his mother.

Afterall, I'm just a crazy Trekkie, but at least I have had the pleasure of saying how much I abhor this film. I will not buy the DVD; I will not recommend the movie. The only reason I give it 3-stars is because, while the story line was anything but Star Trek, the acting was credible, and I have nothing against those who were just playing the roles handed to them.

","As a Trekkie, I had set very high expectations for this film to actually be a true revival of Gene Roddenberry's famous 'Star Trek'. After stepping out of the cinema, I found myself surprisingly satisfied with JJ Abrams's attempt at a brilliant science fiction, yet still managing to keep most aspects of the original Sci Fi TV shows and movies we all came to love.<br/><br/>Star Trek: The Future Begins, or Star Trek VI as many loyal Trekkies would prefer to call it, used an excellent combination of the prime elements in Star Trek, and fresh, original and clever ideas for a well developed Science Fiction. The theory of warp is correct, Bones hasn't lost his witty behaviour, and even Sulu maintains his fencing abilities. New comers to the franchise will also learn how Kirk managed to ""beat"" the Kobayashi Maru, and see his rebellious attitude. For those who have been faithful from the beginning will be pleased to see Leonard Nimoy appear as an older version of Spock, whilst the ""new"" Spock as been beautifully portrayed by Zachary Quinto. However, to make the universe of Star Trek more exciting to both new-comers and ye-faithful, writers Roberto Ocri and Alex Kurtzman have included time travel, unorthodox (to the Star Trek Universe anyway) action sequences, and brilliant plot twists and character development.<br/><br/>What we get from this is a fun, fast paced, thought provoking and original Science Fiction film, plucked from the depths of the Star Trek Universe. Not a moment goes by in this 127 minute epic where audiences, young or old, won't be on the edge of their seats. The plot flows very well, and the film strays from the seemingly new trend of cramming the screenplay with 50 minutes of pointless gibberish. We've been presented with striking cinematography which has been stunningly strung together with clever editing, well written and delivered dialogue, and a cast which couldn't be more accurate to the original unless we revived James Doohan and DeForest Kelly from the grave (or space in Doohan's case), and rejuvenate the whole cast. The acting is flawless, with brilliant character history. The film contains stunning locations helping to bring the Star Trek Universe to life. Again.<br/><br/>With all the above mentioned, it's hard not to praise this great product of Sci Fi, except perhaps the lack of use of the LCARS computer system. There is only one notable disappointment in this film, however. And that's the lack of Oscars it won. The directing was evidently fantastic, with the great charisma of JJ Abrams keeping everyone together. It truly deserves more praise.<br/><br/>It is very safe to say that all audiences, even those who don't like Star Trek, will be able to see the greatness in this amazingly orchestrated piece. There are many words to sum this film up. Epic, brilliant, astonishing are just some of the one-word praises anyone in their right mind can award this film. I can't help by saying – hurry up the sequel."

"grove-93","1","5","8","29 August 2009"," This isn't star trek. It's crap.
","Let me state my level of Trekkiness. I watch a least one episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Enterprise, or Star Trek: Voyager every night. The new movie, which is simply called ""Star Trek,"" lacks the imagination, humanity, and social relevance of the television shows. The story is week and the characters are flat. The director of the movie is J.J. Abrams (the creator of the television show ""Lost."") has turned star trek into space opera. The special effects are neat, but that hardly impresses me, for a movie should be judge on merit alone. I have always enjoyed the television shows of Star trek more then the movies. The Star Trek shows engage the audience with science fiction concepts and questions. For example, one episode might ask the question: Can androids be conceder alive. No such questions were asked during this new recantation of Star Trek. In fact, the audience was not asked to think at all. The Story is ludicrous and is full of plot holes. The movie is just consisted of one action scene after another. During one such scene, three characters unnecessary space dive down to a platform that they have to shoot with hand phasers to deactivate. The scene is absurd because the shuttlecraft they jumped out of had more then enough fire power to destroy the platform. However, J.J. had to give the audience a long convoluted action scene that did not add anything to the story. The story is week, the characters are flat, and J.J. creates the illusion of excitement by having every body running around. J.J. has people running everywhere on the bridge, down corridors, on transporter pads, through sick bay, and anyway else you can think of. All I can say is I will NOT be running to see any more movies by J.J. Abrams. After all the bashing, I have done to this movie. It is time to give the movie its due credit in the special effects category. The movie is full of eye pleasing explosions and alien landscapes. The Enterprise has a new look that is fresh, modern, and clean. To contrast, the bad guy ship is dirty, grungy, huge, and completely impractical. The movie has amazing special effects, which will probably be honored with an Academy Award nomination for best visual effects. That being said, if the special effects were removed, little substance would be left. The movie does not engage the audience. Star Trek was originally created by Gene Roddenberry, who was a pioneer of modern science fiction. He work had to brake down social barriers such as racism, classism, and sexism. J.J. Abrams was not concerned with any of these subjects. He wanted to make a Star Trek movie that was space opera. Space opera is a sub genre of science fiction, but with more of a fantasy element. A perfect example of space opera is the Star Wars movies. Abrams sells the audience short, and thinks all we can handle is effects. In all, the movie is a disappointment, but unfortunately, it made a ton of money. We are sure to be graced with numerous sequels, until the good name of Star Trek is thoroughly smeared into oblivion. Star Trek should only science fiction, and it is a shame that the heart and soul of Gen Roddenberry is lost. I would obviously advise you to skip this movie and never buy it on DVD. With every fiber of my being I will annihilate any positive views of this atrocity of a movie."
"zubdog","5","5","8","29 May 2009"," Disposable entertainment
","I'll state the good stuff first. The cast is first rate and so is the direction and special effects. The film also added some much needed back story to Uhura.<br/><br/>The bad news is to enjoy the film, you'll have to check your brain at the ticket counter. The film has too many plot holes to list, but besides that the time travel plot device to ""reboot"" the franchise was at best lazy and at worst destructive.<br/><br/>My biggest problem was that the revised time line took away so much back story of key characters, especially Kirk. In the previous trek mythology he was an accomplished and seasoned ""professional."" In the new version he is a wet-behind the ears kid who wouldn't be anything if not for his starfleet captain father. I guess in this new time line nepotism is somehow virtuous. The other character's back stories aren't as bad, but they all seemed to be thrown together without much thought to if it made any sense. This all strikes me as unnecessary. There was plenty to explore in the existing back stories of both Kirk and Spock without changing the time line.<br/><br/>The plot also suffers from the number of characters. TV shows like the original Trek do well to explore the characters of an ensemble cast as they have 25 hours or so of programing to fill each year and need adequate material. Movies, on the other hand, generally have time to develop one or two characters really well. In the case of Star Trek the writers tried to do too much in too little time. The movie would have been much better had it focused on the development of a few characters-- say at most Kirk, Spock and Uhura-- and just left the other characters to be introduced in at a later movie. I'd even go as far as to say the the introduction of the Enterprise was unnecessary and might have been better left for the next movie."

It is pretty good space opera, not the best Trek movie, not even really Star Trek but Trekish, too much humor interrupts the suspense, some of the characters and events are cheesy, a few too many plot holes. Leonard Nimoy is ancient. Zachary Quinto did extremely well. Chris Pine is likable but lacks Shatner's charisma. Karl Urban, as expected, can't act. Eric Bana is terrific but is under so much make-up he looks like Joan Rivers. Bruce Greenwood and Zoe Saldana are also terrific. Simon Pegg flops, horribly. Anton Yelchin who plays Chekov was a welcome surprise, not only was the character improved over the original but the acting as well. John Cho was alright but a little too happy go lucky as Sulu. I didn't even recognize Winona Ryder. Thankfully they didn't destroy the Enterprise which has become the second most tired plot device after time travel in Trek movies."

","I have been looking forward to this since summer 2007 when is was released on IMDb that this EPIC prequel/reboot would be coming to our screens in 2009, yet it gets better still, to be directed by none other than J.J. Abrams (to fans of Lost, well hero.) So a bit on the film, now we (well all fans of ""Heroes"") were more that comfortable with JJ's choice for Mr Spock ""Zachary Quinto"" is an extremely accomplished young actor and seems to be turning in to none other that ""Philip H. Seymor"" not in the way of a lovable fat man but in the form of every thing this man gets his hands on is gold, one of the few up coming actors I look forward to watching in what I am sure is many future films.<br/><br/>So that in true Bond stile leaves ""Kirk... James T. Kirk"" played by ""Chris Pine"" who to be honest we were all a bit nevus about. But to the surprise of many die hard ""William Shatner"" fans (also know as the Shatners) was more the willing to fill the boots of the extremely large prints left from previous leading roles from William and Patrick. Chris, he just fits in, perfectly it almost seems that he is the ""Daniel Crag"" to Star Trek.<br/><br/>As we all know the above is only half of any action/SI-FI film the hart lay with the bad guy, to this film know as Nero (for those Star Wars fans out there the Emporia, Dath Vader, Dath Mall and Sir Alan Sugar all rolled in to one) played by Eric Bana who truly brings out the childhood boy inside us (you know, the out who pretends he hates big guns and sexy ladies in films but truly, he loves them) throughout his performance, the hairs on the back of the all the cinemas occupancies truly did stand up with the heroic trailer lie ""FIRE EVERYTHING."" <br/><br/>The film really is art on a screen, in the way of the picture looks amazing. The film is shot, in most quite well, bar a few ""Michael Bay"" moments with a running, bouncing camera but that's what we get for to many people following the ways of the seeming God of film Quentin Tarantino (But back to the CGI.) I honestly don't know what else to say then it is extremely good I mean if you remember back to Spider-man 3 when we all saw the transformation of the Sandman for the first time and it was CGI at its best, I remember watching ""Jonathan Ross"" and he called that seen and I quote ""that is art, really CGI at its best"" it is the same with Star Trek, mouth watering picture the interior course of the film.<br/><br/>So this film in short has a phenomenal cast, director and one bad ass baddie and some fantastic lines like ""FIRE EVERYTHING."" and from one Captain Christopher Pike to a future Captain James T. Kirk ""Your father was Captain for 12 minuets he saved 800 lives... I dare you to do better"" and there are many many more especially from ""Simon Pegg"" aka Scotty. So the question I have tried to ask and I guess am now asking you is, well ware did it all go wrong, its leaves you with the same feeling as Quantum of Solace amazing as your watching it but when its all over you realise that was it... it is over, ware was the climactic ending, then it hits you it was appalling the whole film was anticlimax, visually stunning but pointless. I believe JJ has tried so hard not to make this films ending all about the ""flash and boom"" and no story, witch I am all for but he seems to have forgot to add the ""flash and boom"" that is needed, it seems that the 2 hour film ends in seconds and there is no or hardly any epic Good vs. Evil fight that there is at any film (in some form.)<br/><br/>Out of ten i am not to sure ware it would be, but some ware around the 6 mark. So my sad conclusion is that this film truly is visually stunning, just not at all what it could of been... it could of been a Star Trek."

","A one is too much for this trashy movie. A zero is more like it. First, the story makes no sense. Couldn't keep up with the plot, holes and all. Second, the acting was horrible! I've seen much better acting in High School plays. Where did these actors come from? Grammar school? Even worse was the way it was shot. Wiggly camera shots do not make for enjoyable viewing contrary to what the Director and head honchos who make photograph these movies. Even when the camera is on somebody the camera NEVER STOPS moving...either side to side or around the actor or action. WILL YOU DIRECTORS STOP USING THIS WAY OF FILMING ACTION MOVIES??? The only decent thing were the credits because the movie was FINALLY over...and yes, nice theme song which should have been utilized more. Forget this dog. Good thing I saw this at no cost!!

"The_Other_Snowman","5","3","4","7 June 2014"," Millennial Trek
","2009's version of ""Star Trek"" is a fast-paced, action-packed, frenetic, illogical, nonsensical thrill ride of a movie designed for today's attention-deprived audiences. Two hours in the movie theater left me with a headache and a slight feeling of nausea, which was no doubt the director's intention. Destroy the audience's senses and you're halfway to winning their devotion, much like how a skilled torturer treats his prisoner.<br/><br/>The movie has characters called Kirk and Spock, just as the old TV series did, but that's about as far as the similarities go. The other roles -- Uhura, Scotty, Chekov -- were reinvented for the film, but since they were two-dimensional to begin with that's hardly an issue; what's more annoying is that the writers have updated James T. Kirk for the Millennial generation by making him an unlikable, self-centered, preening egotist without even a shred of charm or a single admirable trait. It's fun to watch him get beat up, which happens at least twice, but I don't think that's the reaction the writers had in mind.<br/><br/>There's a manic plot involving a time-traveling villain blowing up planets with the help of some technobabble weapon, who's the catalyst for a series of contrived coincidences that bring together the heroic crew of the Starship Enterprise. Meanwhile Kirk and Spock meet for the first time, and their relationship follows the formula of a romantic comedy: first they're interested, then they hate each other, then after a big fight they come to love each other, and by the end of the story they're the best of friends.<br/><br/>There are a few odd things that I can only consider anachronisms: Kirk listens to the Beastie Boys and orders Budweiser at a bar, as if the movie didn't actually take place three hundred years in the future. Presumably this was done to let non-Trek fans know that it was okay to enjoy the movie. At the same time there's a visit from Leonard Nimoy, the Original Flavor Spock, to tell Trekkies that it's a legit Trek film after all. The references and homages to Star Trek canon come off more like jokes or parodies, as if it were an overblown SNL skit rather than a major motion picture.<br/><br/>But forget all that: Trekkie or not, all you really need to know about this movie is that it will offer you mindless entertainment for about two hours, assaulting your eyes and ears and sense of equilibrium in every way possible with today's computer-generated technology. About three hours after you started, you'll probably have overcome the motion sickness and forgotten everything you just saw."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","4","6 February 2014"," Long live and prosper! Star Trek is boldly going where no previous Star Trek movie has gone before.
","The Original TV Series of Star Trek change post 1960's Sci-Fi forever. The show replace the tiresome hokey nonsense 1950s Sci-Fi with an intelligent view of the future, where human and aliens are trying to co-exist in peace, while also discovering the universe. It was indeed a new concept at the time; but overtime, Star Trek became view as an old relic of the past. While the film and TV Show franchise survive over the years, reaching out to each new generation of people. There hasn't been this huge support of the Star Trek brand, until this movie by JJ Abrams came out. How did JJ Abram gain main stream success? It was because he did three main things to make Star Trek, seem new. One is mixing the concept of Sci-Fiction with that of the more popular genre Sci-Fantasy. The movie feels more like a new Star Wars movie, then a Star Trek movie. Two: JJ Abrams replace the old actors with new ones, and change the Star Trek canon just enough to appeal new viewers, while not angering too much of the original fan base. Three: JJ Abrams and writer, Robert Orci hypercharge each original character's traits to the extreme. This brings on, a bit of a problem for me, as I found each character, one dimensional stereotypes of their former selves. Indeed, when I first heard who was starting in it, I thought this was a failure from the start. While, I was deeply misguide, I still think the acting is still mediocre at best. I do like Chris Pine playing as a mirror of himself rather than a cheap bad impersonator of William Shatner's James T. Kirk, but Kirk was more than a boyish horn dog which he is mostly portray in the film. Zackary Quinto wasn't bad as Spock, but he look and act like a cheap impersonator. I like how the film put conflict and tense moment between the crew members. I always found Kirk and Spock, a bit too calm when facing danger in the original. I like how they are bumping heads on decision making, here. I found myself, hating that Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) was put more in the back burning in this film, but Uhura (Zoe Saldana) was given more of a role than the previous films. The other crew members are bit cartoony for my taste. From the original cast, only Leonard Nimoy and Majel Barrett (The voice of the ship's computer) return, but they did play a big part. The film plot is that a Romulan name Nero (Eric Bana) from the future, has come back to the past to threatens the Federation because Old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) has cause his home planet to get destroy. Aim with a new weapon call Red Matter, he seeks to destroy every planet that the Federation control. Only James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the rest of the crew of USS Enterprise stand in his way. Some people call this a reboot, which in truth is a yes or no answer. The movie's premise doesn't allow that word to be used as it use both the Original Show timeline and a new timeline. I think the alternate timeline works, because it doesn't erase or ignored the previous films. It frees the new film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements and help pass the torch. The creators have also taken this opportunity to update the look of ships and technology to modern expectations. Still, it looks like a Budweiser brewery than an engine room. The special effects and CGI are wonderful in this film and action pack. Most of the violence is not graphic, rather it is suggestive and intense. Unlike the original movies, there isn't much Science gibberish that comes with this film. The movie doesn't really explain the whole black hole plot line very well, but who cares. I don't think, it was lazy writing. For entertaining reasons, it wasn't needed. The movie does have a comic book Star Trek: Countdown, that explain more of the loose ends like the why the Romulans have a new look, and others. I like how Nero is an amalgamation of the same-named emperor from Roman Empire and Jules Verne's Captain Nemo from '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'. Hints why the Narada looks like a giant octopus. There is a few delete scenes that need to be explore about Nero. The pacing is pretty good, but there is a few scenes that I didn't like, such as the events of Delta Vega. That's incredibly unlikely that all those events happen there. Kirk's promotion from cadet to first officer strained the suspension of disbelief for many. In order for it to happen, everyone above him in the chain of command had to die or be captured. I'm willing justified in that it's the crew's origin story, but it does stretch. One thing, missing from this movie is the very cerebral sense of the previous films about difficult situations and facing the unknown. I doubt it does follow any of Gene Roddenberry's original ideals, but it was indeed misguided popcorn fun. There was some funny moments such as James T. Kirk embarrassing reactions to vaccines. I like the nods to the original show such as the red suit dying, the Kobayshi Maru test, Centaurian slugs, the Green Female Alien, and the classic one liners. There's also a few references to other Star Trek shows. Lots of Easter eggs worth noting from other Sci-Fi movies. Look out for R2-D2 from Star Wars & Slusho drink from 2008's Cloverfield. The music is great, but I can do without the silly puns for songs in the soundtrack. I do like the camera shots, but the Len flare is used too much. Overall: Indeed the future has come and it does look good."
"jjgooner","10","3","4","1 July 2013"," How Star Trek Was Meant To Be
","Star Trek<br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>122 mins/ 12<br/><br/>Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Leonard Nimoy, Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Ben Cross, Winona Ryder, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Morrison<br/><br/>Director: J.J Abrams<br/><br/>Plot: Nero, a Romulan madman, creates an alternate universe in which Kirk has no father as he is growing up, despises Spock, and is not the U.S.S Enterprise's captain. <br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: When I originally heard that they were rebooting the Star Trek series, I was ultimately disappointed. Although Nemesis hadn't provided a terrific film, there was still potential in both the characters and the universe. I must confess, however, that J.J Abrams' Star Trek completely blew me away in its quick pacing, blazing action and effects and a incredibly good take on a series most had though dead. <br/><br/>Acting as a prequel/alternate universe to the original television series, Star Trek introduces us to Kirk's father, George, who is forced to sacrifice himself and the U.S.S Kelvin to time-travelling Romulan, Nero, so that he can save the rest of his crew's life. This is the turning point in the story, meaning every single action done is part of an alternate universe. Being a reboot, this is a very clever way for director J.J Abrams, to separate his film from all previous Trek entries. <br/><br/>The film then follows Kirk as he joins Starfleet at a young age and Spock as he leaves Vulcan to continue his emotional development at Starfleet. After a few amusing incidences, cheating and manipulating, they find themselves together on the Enterprise as they try to defeat and stop Nero from creating black holes that could destroy the federation's planets. Chris Pine stars as the young arrogant, overconfident womaniser that is Officer Kirk. He puts in a very funny and charismatic performance and if we had seen William Shatner's Kirk at that age, he probably would've been like that. The same can be said for all the actors portraying young versions of old characters. Zachary Quinto's Spock is obsessed and completely engrossed in logic and scenes where he and Kirk try to outdo each other leaves you stunned at their sheer hate and annoyance towards one and other.<br/><br/>Some may be disappointed that Karl Urban's Bones McCoy is just an impression of DeForest Kelley's one, but he does, actually do the finest impression I've ever seen. John Cho and Anton Yelchin give strong performances as Sulu and Chekov (who keeps the V, W swap) and Simon Pegg's incarnation of Scotty is far funnier than James Doohan managed. In previous instalments, Uhara, although elegant, was never considered sexy. But here, Zoe Saldana transforms the character into a complete beauty whom both Kirk and Spock fight for. Also in the cast is future Avenger, Chris Hemsworth who, although on-screen for a matter of minutes, creates emotional impact as George Kirk, and Bruce Greenwood, who plays Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike strong and boldly, and also acts as Kirk's mentor.<br/><br/>A nice little surprise for fans is the inclusion of the old universe's Spock, of course portrayed by living legend, Leonard Nimoy. It was an absolute joy to see him on screen and he provides knowledge to the younger characters since he was also drawn into the black hole. His storytelling skills are superb and you feel such despair for him as he describes losing his own universe forever. Eric Bana, who plays Nero, is however, the film's only casting stumble. His acting isn't bad, but he makes little effect on the viewer, for good or for worse. This could be because he is unrecognisable as a tattooed, bald Romulan, or maybe he just isn't suited to playing the bad guy. <br/><br/>The film itself is well paced throughout and full of dazzling action sequences along with top of the market special effects. The modern re-design of the Enterprise's interior is ingenious and the film makes constant references to the original series, which is sure to please all die-hard Trekkies. This film is so entertaining and does what no one has done before. It makes Star Trek cool. This adaption is an amazing re-imagination of the Star Trek universe, which captures the human and philosophical elements of the old while giving it a fresh and modern update. The finale is absolutely thrilling and a final voice-over from Leonard Nimoy that calls space the final frontier and tells us to boldly go where no man has gone before, made me in complete awe of this film even more. The ultimate Star Trek and one of the (if not THE) finest and most accomplished films of the 21st century. A total joy which left me grinning from Vulcan ear to ear."

"NusnakSpilkes","1","3","4","20 May 2013"," Absolutely disgraceful mockery of Star Trek
","Star Trek was about character development and always a voyage of discovery with a positive message, boldly going, etc. All I can say is that Gene Roddenberry would be turning in his grave at this dumbed-down, Homer Simpson mentality mockery of his Star Trek.<br/><br/>JJ Abrahms should be tried with treason for this mess. Without giving any spoilers I can summarize the movie this way: Lots of distracting lens flares (WHY does JJ Abrahms think that is cool - it's BAD camera work), a completely different turn of events, and the whole Star Trek ""universe"" sabotaged in one fell swoop, leaving nothing recognizable of the original franchise. Perhaps this was purposeful, but the end result is a movie, that is so full of plot and scientific holes that only children under the age of 10, or dumb Americans loaded up on meds could not see through the gross flaws. You have to have a very low IQ to like this movie. Very bad job Mr Abrahms. You should not be allowed anywhere near this franchise every again.<br/><br/>The one thing I will say positive is Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr McCoy. Brilliant homage to Deforest Kelly, the movie's ONE and ONLY positive. Chris Pine as Kirk was just PAINFUL. He made Kirk unlikeable and moronic. The rest of the cast were horrible too, even Simon Pegg as Scotty (who I like as an actor) was hideous in the role. And Spock? Let's just not go there. Terrible. This is just not Star Trek - period. Actually, it's not really ANYTHING unless you are a moron."
"dhsilv2","1","3","4","15 May 2013"," the worst addition to star trek ever
","I really wanted to enjoy this film, but there simply wasn't enough good to make up for the flaws. First, Abrams has clearly never seen any Star Trek movie or series. The disrespect to the original series is just astonishing. Second, the film completely leaves science out which is a departure from the original series and leaves this feeling like a fantasy movie vs a well made science fiction piece.<br/><br/>Finally, the story line makes no sense and if you've watch star trek before you'll be completely confused. Romulan's now have mining ships....ships that don't even really need weapons with super powered weapons the ability to come out of black holes and time travel? Of course after some research this is all explained in a comic book where they took some Borg technology, but this is never mentioned. Instead the viewer is left completely baffled and lost trying to connect the 40+ years of history they know from the series into this 2 hour train wreck.<br/><br/>The final verdict is this. If you have ZERO Star Trek knowledge this film is a solid C. The problem is if you've watched any Star Trek nothing about this movie looks, feels, or sounds like Star Trek. They've turned a show about using critical thinking and diplomatic methods to solve problems into an action film and couldn't even make the action fit closely enough in the universe to make it OK because it is a remake. Anyone with any love of Star Trek will need about 20 shots and a strong desire to love this film or a great ability to turn off their brain to tolerate this mess. Sadly this director was not only paid for this, but they let him make a sequel."

","Or better, as if someone took Mona Lisa and studied her for a few minutes, then painted Snooki on a canvas and named it ""Mona Lisa 2009"" . Now, before I really start writing why this movie is a complete catastrophe, I will ask you a question - if this movie wasn't based on 50 year old series, which has a huge background behind, would anything about it happen? Would it get such a high budget, would so many actors audition for it, would people rush as much to see it? In my opinion, of course not. <br/><br/>""So, Gene Roddenberry is dead, we can now ruin his life's work, and of course, make a bunch of money on it."" - I think this is what J.J. Abrams and other writers were thinking when working on this. J.J. Abrams is a good artist, Fringe is incredible, but please Abrams, stay away from Star Trek. <br/><br/>Let's start with the idea of Trek reboot. As I said, this is a 50 year old saga, which marked a huge fire power for science fiction, TV if not humanity in general. A reboot of it isn't nearly done properly, this should be epic, powerful, marking, significant... Instead, 2009 Trek is/was expected to survive and gather fame on original series' fame and fans. Actors really did a fine job, I will give you that, but the only one who really resembled and looked like the original character is Spock played by Quinto. I will admit that others also did good, and I liked them shown from a different perspective but none of them lived up to original guys and never gave a feeling of them. The other thing is special effects. At the same time they were incredible and annoying. They look futuristic and wow, but most of the outside scenes were zoomed in to a part of the ship, overdosed with lens flares which were in fact a commercial for Andrew Kramer's Optical Flares plug-in for Adobe After Effects. All in all, this is a profit- targeted project which was only successful because of huge background of Star Trek."
"Tachikoma-2","7","3","4","27 September 2009"," Star Trek Sabotaged
","Early in the movie kid Kirk demolishes a classic American muscle car, while listening to Beastie Boys ""Sabotage"". He does it for symbolic reasons; He tells the audience that the Star Trek as we knew it, is gone. It is replaced with hip, energetic and ultimately empty version of Star Trek.<br/><br/>Having said that, the characters do work quite well. They just don't resemble their original counterparts at all. Kirk for example is brash, arrogant and headstrong. Chris Pine is a charismatic actor and this new Kirk is a fun character. But he is not the Kirk as we knew him. Same goes for the rest of the cast as well; These are all fine characters, but revised versions of the old ones. That's my biggest grudge with the movie: Why the need to make revisions? Why is Hollywood constantly looking at the past? This constant grave robbing of the past is wearing thin. Why not use this great cast and create whole new characters for them to play? Why not move the Star Treck franchise in to a New Frontier? Why waste millions to recreate something that needs not to be recreated? <br/><br/>Cinematography is ""updated"" as well. Shaky cameras, cgi ships and creatures, signal a new era for Star Trek. It looks more like Battlestar Galactica than Star Trek. Yet despite the efforts, many physical sets are mindbogglingly boring. Ships engine rooms look like contemporary factories. Villains ship interior is just a collection of walkways and ropes. Incredibly dull. I didn't think I saw one impressive shot of Enterprise either. Clumsy directing.<br/><br/>Weakest part of the movie is the script itself. It is constantly turning and twisting, bombarding us with action and snappy dialog, to hide the fact that it is falling apart.On close examination The script does not hold together. The villains motivations are not enough to make us care. The numerous lucky coincidences just don't make any sense at all. Spocks behavior is difficult to explain at times.<br/><br/>Plus the whole time travel plot pretty much destroyed the entire Trek continuity. They are going to have to do some pretty intense time traveling in the next episodes, if they wish to make this mesh with the old Star Trek.<br/><br/>But I suppose they don't want to make this mesh with the originals. If that is the case, why not simply move the story into the future? There's plenty to explore in the universe. There's no need to revamp the past, when you can boldly go where no man has gone before."
"user-196-766417","2","4","6","2 January 2015"," One word: disrespect.
","With this new reboot, J.J. Abrams has completely destroyed the spirit of the Star Trek franchise, under the excuse that it's 'a prequel set in an alternate universe'. Roddenberry's Star Trek was a series of moral tales and social commentaries, and Abrams has dumbed this down to a glitzy sci-fi action flick. He has stated that it was meant to reach out to non-Trekkies as well, but that is no excuse for a bad script.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>Bones and Sulu were written decently, I guess. But Bones, who was an important member of the original triumvirate, seems to be relegated to a minor character.<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>Oh boy.<br/><br/>The plot is unbelievable. Sure, it's sci-fi, and I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief, but Nero's implausible motivations, combined with an overused vengeance plot, creates a movie that is just so incredibly grating. I'm not even going to mention physics, or the laws of warp travel set in the Original Series.<br/><br/>The main problem is the writing of the characters. The actors did the best they could, but even they can't work miracles.<br/><br/>Kirk is overly cavalier and arrogant, to the point where I was continually irritated by his very presence. Why Pike would choose such an unreliable, cocky idiot as his First Officer is incomprehensible.<br/><br/>The deliberate mischaracterisation of Spock (when he dumps Kirk on Delta Vega) is done only to antagonise him, and, more importantly, alienates him and Kirk. Then, they're suddenly friends at the end of the movie when Spock defers to Kirk and asks to serve as his First Officer. Such rushed character development is unrealistic. <br/><br/>Uhura has been reduced a love-interest who kicks ass. Writers these days don't seem to realise that strong female character does not equate to perfect female character. She is also unnecessarily sexualised (when Kirk watches her take off her clothes), like so many women in films these days.<br/><br/>All of these one-dimensional characters simply heighten the unrealism of the film. In science fiction, where setting and physics are outlandish, relatable characters are needed to ground the viewer. ""Star Trek"" fails in this regard.<br/><br/>This movie seems also to be one of those action-for-the-sake-of- action movies. There is an overload of explosions, destruction and laser beams. If you like this sort of stuff, you're in for a treat, but this overuse of action is an insult to the intellectual puzzles and peacekeeping missions of the Original Series.<br/><br/>Star Trek is an unrealistic, overly fast-paced movie that lacks substance and is disrespectful to the Original Series. Both the characters and the plot lack gravitas, and in the end, I just didn't care for any of it."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","1","4","6","25 December 2014"," Teen Trek: the next de-generation
","This latest Star Trek re-boot has the aesthetic of Star Wars crossed with a teenage soap opera. Like so many modern films, tiresome old-fashioned things like plot and character development are jettisoned in order to accommodate more empty spectacle. <br/><br/>In TOS all the characters had a depth and dignity, even when clowning around. You can believe they would all command respect and loyalty. Here they are replaced with emoting prima donnas, people who, not only would you not follow, but would go out of your way to avoid.<br/><br/>It would be impossible to point out all the badness of this travesty, but here's a few which stuck in my mind.<br/><br/>1. A pointless ""heroic"" death scene at the start merely to give Kirk some ""skin in the game"".<br/><br/>2. A pointless scene of young Kirk stealing and destroying a car merely to show he's a maverick. Ditto the following bar room brawl.(By the way isn't it odd that everyone in the 23rd century is heavily into 20th century rock music?) <br/><br/>3. A time traveller who spends 25 years in the past grieving over a planet that will die 125 years in the future and does not lift a finger to see his family or warn the inhabitants. Instead he spends the whole time thinking up a ludicrous and bombastic revenge scheme.<br/><br/>4, Despite, in TOS the enterprise having a chain of command based on age and experience and all the crew obviously joining at different times, (Spock explicitly states that he had served Capt Pike for 11 years for example) here they all become crew members on exactly the same day.<br/><br/>5. Starfleet's flagship being handed over to raw recruits with no supervision. The only moment that inexperience might be a problem is when Sulu bungles the takeoff. But this rare intrusion of realism does not last.<br/><br/>6. Apparently people carry around swords (or sword handles that magically just grow into swords) in the 23rd century so they can have sword fights atop drills. Well it worked in Star Wars didn't it? <br/><br/>7. Chekhov being able to run the length of the ship and still save the falling crew.<br/><br/>8. Kirk is given the captaincy, even though there are more highly ranked officers on board (Which is to say, EVERYBODY ELSE on board since he was officially suspended from Starfleet). Oh and by the way, why didn't Spock resume the captaincy when he recovered? <br/><br/>9. Scotty being immediately given control of the engine room despite having just beamed on board. And why was this genius engineer stuck on a deserted ice planet anyway? <br/><br/>10. Spock deserves a whole list to himself.<br/><br/>a) His romance with Uhura. I burst out laughing at this. Adolescent smooching in the elevator and the teleport pad is unbecoming in anyone let alone MR Spock.<br/><br/>b) His jettisoning of Kirk on a frozen and dangerous planet. No Starfleet officer would conceivably do this to another officer. The only reason is, of course, the plot demands it.<br/><br/>c) The ludicrous and uncharacteristic way that he explodes when challenged by Kirk.<br/><br/>Needless to say, given the badness of the script, the actors fail to rise to it with the exception of Karl Urban who does an outstanding job as bones, and Anton Yelsin who makes a reasonable fist of the teenage Chekhov. Of Simon Pegg's performance, the least said the better."
"goldenshuttle","4","4","6","26 September 2012"," Disappointing
","The problem with this movie are the characters. Nimoy and Shatner in the original play were shining young, but mature enough to manage such a legendary trip to deep space. Here we see a bunch of teenagers; trying to look mature for the same role. And they failed. You cannot send a ship with teenager captain, it looks ridiculous. At any moment it felt like they want to jump on the bridge, catch a few guitars and sing rock songs, or have a tattoo party in deep space...No disrespect, but Chris Pine and Zachary cannot compare to Shatner and Nimoy in any way. Perhaps if the director brought some exact look-alike it may have succeeded. watching Zachary playing a teenage Vulcan and painting that serous look on his face is totally ironic.....I wasted 15 minutes and did not bother to watch further.<br/><br/>This is another example of declining quality in Hollywood."

","I thought I would give a quick review regarding the people who say ""it's a great movie but it isn't Star Trek"". While I wouldn't call myself a trekkie (more a sci fi nerd) I can honestly say I have seen every incarnation of Trek to date, every episode, every movie... MMM, maybe I am a trekkie (Though I DO NOT own a uniform!). Gene Rodenberry's vision of Star Trek changed and evolved throughout the various series, so I am going to concentrate on one - Star Trek the original series, not the films with the original crew, the ORIGINAL series (TOS). I still watch TOS today and while later incarnations were more polished and had very credible sci tech and science babble in them, TOS was about the adventure, the relationships between the crew especially between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. They didn't care if the story wouldn't stand up scientifically they were morality plays with friendship at their heart. THIS is what the 2009 incarnation is all about. It isn't like the films with the original crew or the Next Gen or Voyager, but if you honestly sit down and watch the TOS, it is quite a different animal. I think this film is better for that. I once read that Rodenberry was asked what he would like to see for the future of Star Trek and he said he would like to see some bright young thing do it bigger and bolder than he ever could..... Nuff said!"

He's reduced to a bar-brawling nincompoop with an annoying swagger. No trace of the brains, and charm, that the original Kirk more often than not, showed. He's just an annoying, reckless ADHD toddler, that should be kept as far away from a billion dollar exploration vessel, as possible. He succeeded in actually making me HATE a character. Quite a feat, because I tend to forget characters that are wrong somehow.<br/><br/>Spock, on the other hand, played very well by the ex- ""Heroes"" bad guy, (sortof bad-guy, to be honest) comes off as half-way decent, despite the crappy role the script forces him in.<br/><br/>His relation with Uhura was a nice refreshing bit, and there could have been done more with that, but it got swept aside by the TOTALLY, UNABASHED, HORRENDOUS, CONVOLUTED plot.

"Jakealope","4","4","6","12 December 2011"," Takes the History, Gadgets & Characters of the OId But Leaves out the Theme
","While this ""reboot"" is certainly a lot better than the last 3 odd ""The Next Generation"" themed features, it is more of a muscular amped up sci fi action adventure movie than a true Trek storyline. In that the plot is simple: Surviving Romulans get all bent out of shape because their star went supernova, while Spock the Vulcan was on the way to help them, that they go back into time to get revenge on the Federation and Spock for failing to get their in time. Of course, it is rather sour grapes since the Romulans were antagonistic to the Federation long after the Klingons made peace. Time travel is a weak plot device most of the time, so that is one strike. Two, the whole plot is built around revenge and destruction, which is hardly an inspiring, open, looking into the unknown type of theme that made Star Trek so popular.<br/><br/>Also, it made Kirk and all the TOS regulars of the same age and class, sans Spock. So it was more like a Dawsons Creek teen adventure motif. Kirk is some bad ass tearaway, since his dad died fighting our time traveling revenge seeking Romulan, that he steals his uncle's 1967 Corvette Stingray and drives it off a cliff, jumping to safety at the last moment, to the sounds of the Beastie Boy's ""Sabotage"" on the car's radio. While even I laughed at such a crowd pleasing scene, it was definitely simple minded juvenile defiance and larceny, hardly auguring future greatness. From then on, it is one hijink after another, with some interesting action scenes, some downright silly like being chased by some ice monster after being stranded by Spock for defying Spock's commands. Why they couldn't just lock Kirk in the brig was never explained. But the ice monster did lead him to the future old Leonard Nimoy Spock, also stranded on the same ice planet by the bad Romulan Nero. Than that silly set of coincidences leads them to find Scotty, who is by himself with a robot helper on the same remote ice world working on a fancy transporter system. I mean is this supposed to be taken seriously? They aren't obligated to follow Star Trek ""history"" to the letter, but please be a little real, not one silly coincidence after another.<br/><br/>There is no sense of finding and dealing with the unknown and man or the future, just the obligatory showdown where blah blah all is put right in the end, bad guys poof! So if you are looking for a decent action adventure movie and know nothing about Star Trek, you'll like it. But if you are looking for a newer and better Trek, no way!"

"bkoganbing","6","4","6","16 March 2011"," Kirk And Spock In Their Salad Days
","Star Trek purists all over the universe are trashing this version of Star Trek and while I don't consider myself a purist as such, this one did not leave me yearning for more.<br/><br/>This version has the classic characters that have become so identified with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy played by young actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. We see them as children, in the case of Kirk at the moment of his birth, and then growing up into top flight cadets at Starfleet Academy. But there's no hint of the camaraderie that we remember from the television series or the films. <br/><br/>Young Kirk is a rebel and we don't know if he'll ever be any good. Far cry from the disciplined starship captain we know. Spock is pretty much the character we do remember, he is a younger version of Leonard Nimoy. The others are all there as younger versions of themselves. <br/><br/>Now as we're going through the film, purists will spot the many flaws in the saga we've seen develop. But that is later explained when we know the true nature of the villain that the Enterprise is pursuing. That would be Eric Bana a time traveling Romulan who's got a doomsday weapon and he's going to wipe out a lot of history as we've learned it.<br/><br/>He alters quite a bit of it so if new films are made and they are planned, the Trekkies will have to get used to a whole new dynamic. One change that was for the better, it was nice to see Zoe Saldana as a young Uhura get around and actually have a life beyond opening hailing frequencies.<br/><br/>The science seems flawed and I suppose we'll have to wait to get into the Star Trek century before we can get a clue if what happens in this film could actually happen. But I do wish they'd given the new Kirk and Spock a better introductory story because now they're stuck in those parameters."

THIS is my only problem. I would have enjoyed this movie, possibly enough to actually buy it. BUT, I guess the latest thing in movies, to add to drama in suspense, is to make the camera as shaky as possible. During fight scenes chases, any type of action, it's very hard to follow with what is going on when all you see is blurriness. So I became VERY frustrated! I don't need someone to tell me that the moment is intense by shaking the camera to the point i can't tell whats going on anymore. That's like someone showing me an intense photograph, of like someone jumping from a building, but then they start shaking the photograph in front of me, I can no longer see the detail, and my brain can no longer register the photo.

","This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everything about it, from script to direction to cinematography, is completely devoid of intelligence. They've replaced any sort of thoughtfulness or care with lasers, shaky-cam, and LENS FLARE.<br/><br/>What little story there is, is rife with unbelievable decision-making on the part of the characters, leading to nigh-impossible coincidences. Spock, for instance, makes a decision that is tantamount to attempted murder, for no real good reason.<br/><br/>Don't even bother trying to understand anything as simple as spacial relationships in this movie. It's impossible. But who cares, right? LASERS! LENS FLARE!

They're like watching a Saturday Night Live skit, but they are far, far better than Zach Quinto and, especially, Chris Pine. Spock and Kirk are complete, for lack of a better term, douchebags now. Kirk especially misses the mark, going from studious, devoted Starfleet officer to TEEN REBEL.<br/><br/>The score is terrible, certainly not up to the standards of Jerry Goldsmith or James Horner. When the theme from the original series kicks in over the end credits, it feels totally out of place.<br/><br/>I cannot comprehend how anybody could rate this movie highly. It is possible to do action intelligently! Die Hard, or Total Recall, or Raiders of the Lost Ark, for example.

"ssame1","1","45","119","12 May 2009"," My Thoughts on JJ Abrams and his Star Trek
","So, as I suspected, I did not like the new Star Trek film/movie. Let me repeat myself, I did not like the new Star Trek movie. Unfortunately, giving a movie project to a non-Star Trek fan is comparable to giving a head coaching job with the Yankees to a person who doesn't like baseball. Being a new convert, watching for only 10 years or so I came to the realization that this film, like all films, was made to make money – lots of it! Although one could argue that anyone who took on the new Star Trek project would make money, regardless of who was at the helm of this intricate, massive, cultural-hit of a concept. Alas, in this case it is J.J. Abrams, the ""stealer,"" the ""3M"" of many of someone else's idea kind-of director/writer. Please insert your own comparisons for Alias (La Femme Nikita), Fringe (X-Files), Cloverfield (Godzilla meets Blair Witch Project), Lost (The Prisoner from the 1960's meets Gilligans Island), etc...<br/><br/>Before I tear a hole in J.J.s alternate-universe of Star Trek, let's give credit where credit is due and make it clear what the silver-lining was: 1) J.J. probably ignited, excited, and down-right invited non-Star Trek fans into possibly researching/enjoying the Star Trek of old and become a fanatic of the sci-fi ""Enterprise"" and all its counterparts. 2) He made Star Trek ""cool"", especially for the younger generation, perhaps younger than me (30). 3) The set, studio, CGI, casting (mostly, especially ""Bones""), and most of the storyline (I'll get to this later) was awe-inspiring, saliva-inducing, and visually stimulating to any creature on Earth. 4) They kept the ""funny"" quibbles in the script. Good job.<br/><br/>These examples of what was good should be enough to love the film, right!? It really sounds like I really enjoyed it, right!? No. And here's why: 1) Once you get past the ""glitz & glamor"" of JJ's Star Trek alternate universe, you realize he forgot one thing many Star Trek television series episodes had, a ""realness."" Well, you're thinking I'm some head-case to think Star Trek is real. No, I'm not a crazed, Star Trek lunatic, let me explain. Every Star Trek episode/movie teaches a lesson on life – one could argue Kirk, Spock and crew in the movie showed valor, braveness in this film, but at what cost? The message in this film was transparent: Action, revenge, action. It didn't teach me anything about the dangers or consequences of revenge. 2) The original Star Trek had its own explosions, shouting, and grunting, but rarely used expletives, such as ""G.D."" Of course, in reality people curse, and I probably do it more than others, but it was another discrepancy to start from a sci-fi series that rarely curses. 3) Yes, I mentioned the casting/storyline was ""almost there"" but the Sulu actor did not come close to the original; the inflection of voice/tone was especially lacking. The storyline: Well it's completely new for Star Trek – everything that came before, and I mean everything, would logically need to be discarded. Why? In the new film there is now no Vulcan planet, and Kirk's father, as well as Spock's mother (an important supporting character in the original time-line) have perished. This changes everything, creating a J.J. Abrams ""alternate universe of Star Trek"" Star Trek.<br/><br/>Whether you are a purest, hardcore Star Trek fan or newbie, the movie is definitely a love/hate situation. Basically, this movie disregarded/omitted all previously known created Star Trek material, because the time-line has changed and all the choices/adventures would be irrelevant. Does this set-up allow the studios to make new adventures and create new character development? Yes. Does it sum everything I like about Star Trek? Almost.<br/><br/>Overall, there were many good/bad choices. I don't care for the ""hold-my-hand"", watered down, non-thinking Star Trek. To me, there was no rewarding personal character development or new insights. I didn't take away a moral lesson, such as, ""oh, this is how I should live as a person...with character, respect, duty, honor, pride, encompassing critical thinking/feeling skills."" This movie tells me I should live by a feeling that lacks realism combined with frenetic movement, and more explosions, the ""I can't think, but I can react to visual stimulation"" crap. Many will like the dumbed-down, in-your-face version of Star Trek, but I will always have the original genius of Gene Roddenberry vision in mind. This is one that is thought-provoking, breeds massive fans and has been doing just fine for 50 or so years without the almighty, J.J. ""stealer of good things""...""got to 3M everything"" Abrams. All in all, it's like different versions/translations of the Bible, everyone has their opinion. But for me, and many others, it just didn't have the heart of Star Trek and now is a critical time for fans to decide, J.J. is attempting to become the modern-day figurehead of Star Trek, leading the series away from the vision that should and always be guided by the foundation Roddenberry built.<br/><br/>As for the blatant disregard for William Shatner in the new film, especially his original narration, I hope J.J. ""boldly goes where no man has gone before"" and stays there in an isolated chamber, so he can not steal, borrow, nor corrupt another concept from an original creator and call it his own. ""Live, long, and prosper...in a galaxy far, far away""...oh wait a minute; I don't want to give J.J. any more ""new"" ideas."

It is an enjoyable movie. Had you called it, ""Let's Romp Through the Universe And Save It"" I probably would have given this movie a pretty high mark.<br/><br/>BUT it's Star Trek, and I expected more. I expected a pushing of the envelope. Look at the early Star Trek movies, and series and what you get are topics that push people. Whether it be a ""colored"" person, a person that looks like Satan (Spock) or a robot that is intelligent (Data).<br/><br/>Think about this one. We would not think twice about conversing with a robot and being friends with a robot. When STNG came out in 1987 we thought robots were things that you kept at arms length and to be wary of. Yet Star Trek changed that.<br/><br/>What does this Star Trek movie do? NOT MUCH!!! Sure great movie, great effects, but that I can get from another movie.

"merdiolu","2","17","39","22 May 2009"," That's what happens when you extend a franchise beyond its natural limits...
","I went to to this last Star Trek movie with a friend of mine. I am a trekie and watched every series and movie though I am not an overzeaolous fan of this franchise. In fact I am very critical and selective and I won't deny there are some moments of banality and low quality as well as brilliant episodes or movies in 43 years of Star Trek. My friend however never heard of Star Trek and whole concept was new to him though he is a very good critic himself. We both have seen the movie...<br/><br/>and both of us disliked it....<br/><br/>Let's look from two different perspectives...As for Star Trek fans this movie signals death of 43 years of deep Gene Roddenberry themes , philosophy and vision. Star Trek was always about exploration , getting whole universe a better place for mankind and its surrounding races , deep philosophic problems or questions ( remember original series Spock and Dr. McKoy always bickering. They were representing opposite ends of a serious theme or problem) They are gone now. Now it is all about CGI battles against powerful and two dimensional villains who has a personal grudge against main characters and who wish to destroy Earth/Federation/Humanity because of that with super powerful weapons. So the endings are always predictable. You can not identify yourself with destruction of Earth so Vulcan had to go. (we humans always think ourselves and our planet as center of universe selfishly by the way. Even Star Trek adapted that stupid thinking ) Destruction of Vulcan changes whole history of Star Trek and make previous entries invalid.<br/><br/>By the way I am not a purist and if there had been a decent script with proper drama at least I would even liked it despite all of negative factors I mentioned above but the whole movie was also a giant ST X:Nemesis and ST:II The Wrath of Khan rip off with elements of time travel from ST:VIII First Contact added. I can say Orci and Kurtzman watched these three movies and decided to write a script which mixes all three...So it is not even authentic or original. During whole movie I said myself ""I have seen that before"" In fact characterizations was even worse. During whole movie most of the cast (except Leonard Nimoy and Bruce Greenwood) were either playing young and kid versions or parody types of TOS characters (especially Yelchin and Pegg ) Even in worst entries of this franchise ( before this movie ) like in ST:V or ST:X most of the characters were taking themselves seriously. So aim of this movie is clear. Young , 12-18 year olds who never watched Star Trek or its excellent spin off versions....Kids who will be entertained and buy Star Trek toys in Burger King but forget everything in a few years (who is remembering Transformers anyway right now ?) This is a result of Hollywood Studios always looking to gross income of week not if they ever done an actual art production....<br/><br/>As for my friend he simply said ""In an age where they make dark , exciting and thinking sci-fi productions like BSG or Alien this kind of childish productions are bound to fail in artistic sense...I agree completely..."

It started out well and began to sink, getting cheesier as the series went on, finishing up with one of the worst finales in history.<br/><br/>The problems I see with the modern Star Trek franchise are the same problems with all forms of mass-media-produced ""art"": dumbing down to a small set of clichés, overly simplified plots, pointless action scenes.<br/><br/>An example is enemies: in Star Trek: TNG, enemies were not black and white, there were no ""outright evil"" races. The races all had good and bad qualities, including humans. There were moral dilemmas, and when there was action, it served a purpose. Now it is merely Distinct Good vs. Distinct Evil, ala The Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>You have the ""evil enemy"" which is portrayed using:<br/><br/>Dark corridors; dark bridges; dark computers; dim green lights; pools of dark water; dripping water; slime; residue; smooth curves coming to sharp points; vampire-styled cloaks which come up above the shoulders; high places everywhere to fall from; enemies can't hit anyone with their hand-held weapons; etc.<br/><br/>You can see this clichéd viewpoint becoming more prominent as time passes. The Borg went from having extremely bright and quiet ships in TNG, to being extremely dark, green-tinted and ""creepy sounding"" in Voyager.<br/><br/>I didn't think the clichés could get worse than they were in ""Star Trek: Nemesis"", with all of the ones I listed above, but this new ""Star Trek"" movie has succeeded. From start to finish it is one cliché after another. The first 1/4 of the movie I rated a 6/10, it was moderately enjoyable though left a lot of questions unanswered. As it progressed it became cheesier, and it seemed clear there would be no dealing with the gaping plot holes.<br/><br/>To name just a few that come to mind:<br/><br/>A black hole magically doesn't destroy the ship, but sends them back in time to the exact point in time and space where Kirk's father is on a mission for the first time.<br/><br/>Kirk is left on an ice world and runs away from some random monsters before finding a cave in miles upon miles of wasteland, then goes into a cave where he finds old Spock. Why would Spock be living in a cave rather than going to the Starfleet base a couple miles away? Why is Spock randomly on the same planet that Kirk is left on? Why is Spock randomly on the same part of the planet as Kirk? Where did Spock get firewood from when there are no trees around for miles in every direction?<br/><br/>Why are there open sewers on the Romulan ship? Actual shin-deep dirty water sewers with water dripping from the roof and no lights, on a spaceship. Why are there cliffs on the ship everywhere you look, without so much as railings? No spaceship designer would possibly be that stupid. Why are there no lights on the Romulan ship? The ship is powerful enough to destroy planets, yet it can't light up its hallways, or even its command bridge?<br/><br/>In the opening scene it is said that they can't take another blast like they already sustained, yet they take dozens more blasts over a period of almost ten minutes, without being destroyed. They manage to very slowly fly their ship into a collision Romulan ship, a ship that is shown to be able to turn and go to warp in a couple seconds flat, stands around doing nothing for minutes while the Starfleet vessel rams into it.<br/><br/>The whole scene with young Kirk driving the car off a cliff and diving out. Not to mention the security would merely have transported Kirk out of the car to a holding cell. Why must movies have scenes of people hanging on to cliff edges for their life? It's painfully cheesy to watch. This movie had 4+ scenes of people hanging onto edges for their life.<br/><br/>The last scene where the enterprise ejects its warp core (well, apparently it has a half-dozen warp cores?) to ""push itself out of the singularity"". Um, no? They were unable to escape the singularity at Warp 4, that is far faster than the speed of light, why would a regular explosion help? Warp speed is thousands to millions of times faster than a mere explosion. Exploding warp cores have been used many times throughout Star Trek to blow up enemy ships, but we're expected to believe that it instead gently pushes the Enterprise out of a black hole without a scratch on it?<br/><br/>The movie throws out the ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" plot by changing completely what happens, yet magically we are expected to believe that despite the universe drastically changing, somehow all original members of the Enterprise crew are reunited during a series of unbelievably unlikely events on random planets and places.<br/><br/>If anyone has read The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy series, book 5 ""Mostly Harmless"", there is a new guidebook that is able to traverse possible timelines in the way that best suits its own goals. This perfectly matches the plot of this movie: unbelievable coincidences coming to a particular conclusion. This is insulting to anyone with common sense.<br/><br/>I can not believe that this clichéd and cheesy movie is on the IMDb Top 250 list. My rating of it went down progressively from 6/10 to 2/10 as the movie progressed from clichéd scene to clichéd scene. This movie has no artistic merit, no plot, no meaningful action, nothing to it at all. It is empty, Hollywood drivel."

","The stars are for special effects and some (not all!) actors' performance. This is the utmost concession that I can make to this disaster of a movie.<br/><br/>Because, let's face the truth, it is forgettable like nothing else, and it betrays all the visions and philosophies of TNG and DS9 for the cheap thrill easily induced in an increasingly brainless popcorn audience.<br/><br/>Anything else to say? Well, one last thing: Commercial success, the golden calf of our century, is no challenge for the film industry anymore. Simple screenplays for simple consumers, add some spicy ingredients like young actors, sex, and CGI, finally stir long enough with marketing machinery - and no one of the new generation will complain about this meal which oddly tastes like the last fifty meals served. - The ones who had to vomit will soon die out."

","Times they are a changing. This new flavor of Trek will appeal to TOS fans because they shares some similarities. It's just as cheap (although not low budget), but then again completely lacks the originality of TOS.<br/><br/>The fans of TNG will find it absolutely abhorrent. Like a version of Macbeth where characters, although dressed in XVI century garb, are constantly jumping on trampolines and singing show tunes. (you have to remember though that what was once considered mere light entertainment is only now considered high art) <br/><br/>Then again this movie is clearly targeted at the new generation, if you pardon the pun. The same audience that seems to enjoy the new Batman, new Indiana Jones, the latest X-Man and Transformer movies. And The high rating is clear proof that its doing that job well.<br/><br/>The cast was not bad I have to say, especially Spok and Uhura, although Nero and Kirk could have been better. The look of it isn't bad either, the costumes, graphics and event the action sequences are all good form a purely technical point of view. However, the movie fails utterly when it comes to writing. Although there are numerous examples of the garbage the actors had to work with throughout the movie, none stands out as much as the ""Scotty"" sequences. Many have come to blame the actor, but even Alec Guinness would be unable to do anything good with those lines. Other more obvious examples include the ""green chick"", Kobayashi Maru (some things work out better as just a reference, like explaining the meaning of a joke spoils it), Scottys helper, young Kirks car ride, young Spocks fight, the glacier chase, the list goes on and on. And the villains are somewhat lackluster, even more so then in Nemesis and somewhat reminiscent of them.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind that it's entertainment targeted at a young male audience and not art, it is more than decent. However as a TNG fan I came to expect something more than just pretty visuals and familiar characters, there is clearly no food for thought here, nor any real drama, plenty of action and bad jokes though. 4/10"

And here are my reasons why - The acting was terrible, the design of the Enterprise was awful and the design of the bridge was too out there.<br/><br/>Also the story was pathetic...Abrams wanted to do a Re-Start of the series (even though it does'nt need one) and he used a really bad time travel story so he could tell it his way (WHICH IS A CRAP WAY) why did the romulans go to all that trouble when they could have just went back to Romulus to save them. lol And also at the beginning the romulans came through the black hole thing which looked like a thunder storm in space...then Spock came through one...then when they attacked Vulcan...there is another one...WHY???? And who here actually believes that if Romulas was going to be destroyed that the federation (even if they where still enemies after Nemisis, even though they had started talking) would be out there helping straight away...<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE SUCKED.<br/><br/>it was a terrible action movie, terrible sci - fi movie and the worst STARK TREK MOVIE EVER...<br/><br/>ps. they should have just made a Start Trek Voyager movie lol"

Lastly Pine enters the reactor and in spite of massive radiation exposure
is able by brute strength to kick the engine back into alignment. He dies of course. let us hope the franchise died with him. I fear not however. The other thing that always annoys me in this kind of movie, is the huge hallways. Space is at a premium in space (pun). What are they for, you never see large numbers of people using them? In fact you never see much of the ordinary crew members either. Even the earthly hotels do not have wide corridors, space is expensive, especially on space ships."

","The fact that this movie was even made, coupled with that fact that people actually claim to like it, has permanently damaged my faith in the human race. Watching this movie was like passing a bowel obstruction, only when it was over did I feel any relief and there was crying from the ordeal. I will NEVER see a JJ Abrahms movie again, EVER! And frankly, I think I deserve compensation for the time I wasted watching it. This is definitely for ""Generation Me"", basically have a bunch of teenagers and twenty-somethings run around screaming drama at each other, and when they aren't doing that they're making out. Perhaps if the original series hadn't led to later movies like Wrath of Khan and First Contact, and later TV shows like Deep Space 9 and Voyager, I could understand a reboot. I probably wouldn't have cared about the reboot at all, but 'old spock' from the original timeline shows up and claims everything Star Trek amounted to in about 50+ years has been washed away. Frankly, it felt juvinile and insulting. Then the rest of the movie follows a Star Wars plot line, only thing missing were lightsabers and wookies. Probably in the cut scenes.

How did they transport onto the ship that was lightyears away? I understand that they had the equation to transport at warp speed, but that doesn't mean they can transport trillions of miles away. If that were possible they could just transport from planet to planet and wouldn't need the spaceships. Why was Kirk such a douche? Even as a little kid he was an asshole. Why did he want to wreck that car? Why was he driving a car from the 60s and listening to music from the 90s? I don't mind watching mindless action movies just for the sake of action, but this movie was so full of holes it was impossible to see past them.<br/><br/>And finally, why did they change the entire timeline of the series?

And then there was the bridge of the Romulan ship which consisted of irregular shaped panels suspended dangerously over a mysterious chasm (be careful jumping to the science station or you'll fall to your horrible death!).<br/><br/>It would have been OK if it was a stand alone film, but they were working with many years of (usually) excellent Star Trek episodes and movies, and they should have given the canon, and the intelligence of the audience, a little more respect than that.

"randallgsmith","2","54","151","8 May 2009"," What's the point?
","J.J. Abrams and his crew apparently live by the maxim that ""ignorance is virtue""; it's difficult otherwise to believe that the creators of the 2009 Star Trek film have even *watched* any of the episodes of the long running series, let alone *studied* them in an effort to prepare for this latest installment. Aside from shallow parodies of some of the original characters, performed by a collection of barely post-pubescent actors (Cliff Robertson seems to be the only person in Star Fleet over the age of 25 in this century), there is very little for devoted Star Trek fans to recognize or celebrate here.<br/><br/>The script is particularly atrocious; apparently, scribblers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (Transformers, The Legend of Zorro) console themselves that ""it's just science fiction"" when justifying the endless array of non-sequitur scenes, weak or impossible science, breakdowns in logic, inconsistent tone, lack of motivation, and unrealistic characterizations. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of the original series, famously fought a one-man war *against* this kind of thinking when struggling to make a believable series back in the 60s; looks like his followers have now surrendered in this war without firing a shot.<br/><br/>(My favorite absurdity among many is the way the command structure on the Enterprise keeps changing every 5 minutes, as cadets who haven't even graduated from the Academy appoint themselves Captain, First Officer, etc., then resign, then come back as a different officer a short time later, much like it works in the movie industry, I suppose. Apparently the Enterprise crew is comprised of sheep who will take orders from anyone who comes over the ship's intercom. And BTW, when did the interior of the Enterprise start looking like a mixture of an Apple store and an oil refinery?) <br/><br/>Today's viewers and anxious movie executives may call this a ""rebooting"" of the series, by which I suppose they mean that any trace of the original show was lost once the power was removed."
"xo_l_colbzz_ox","10","13","29","17 May 2009"," Creating a New Fan Base at Warp Speed
","I've never been into anything ""Star Trek."" I don't mean to say that there's anything wrong with it, but watching a guy with pointy ears and a bad bowl cut travel through space in a spaceship that somewhat resembles a large pizza cutter just isn't my thing. While they did bring me out to see the film on its early Thursday release, the previews for the reboot didn't have me expecting much more than a decent ""Star Trek"" with more action and better special effects than I'd expect in the others.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams proved me wrong. And despite the numerous Trekkies returning Spock's Vulcan Salute at the end of the film, I couldn't help but think that ""Star Trek"" is really cool. The time travel plot is cool. The black holes are cool. The characters are cool. Everything is just so cool.<br/><br/>But, beyond being cool and easily appealing to the masses, ""Star Trek"" is just a good film. It starts out with one of the saddest opening scenes ever to appear in a movie, but even that scene is fast-paced and exciting like the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The film mostly follows James Kirk as a cadet on his first trip aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise during its maiden voyage. What should be a rescue mission at Vulcan turns into a fight for the United Federation of Planets against the insane Romulans that appeared mysteriously and attacked a Federation ship decades before. And thus the adventure begins.<br/><br/>The time travel plot allows ""Star Trek"" to be one of the smartest reboots ever made. Most rebooted films completely disregard all events of any previous films or television shows, and the only references made to them are typically reference gags for the audience members who remember them. But ""Star Trek"" goes beyond the basic function of a reboot.<br/><br/>The black hole that sends the Romulans back in time creates an alternate universe and allows the old material to coexist with it. Because of this, new audiences don't need to know anything about previous ""Star Trek"" films and television series. By recognizing the existence of both time lines, the film creates a synthesis of the old material and the new film that allows a new fan base to join the old one.<br/><br/>Of course, the casting directors deserve credit for a job done brilliantly. Few of the lead cast members are entirely recognizable, but almost all of them are great in their roles.<br/><br/>Chris Pine, really only known for his role in the forgettable ""The Princes Diaries 2,"" makes the film. His Kirk is a complete smart alack, a role that he plays extremely well. About 80% of the film's laughs are owed to him, and he's proved that he may be the next great action hero.<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto is great at maintaining the calm, collected attitude of the half Vulcan Spock, as well as delivering the one emotional outburst he has in the film. Some of his best scenes include the ones in which his character is in opposition to Kirk. Quinto and Pine play well off of one another and complement each other.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Karl Urban also give memorable performances as Scotty and McCoy, respectively. That extra 20% of the humor comes from their characters, both of whom serve as some sort of sidekick to Kirk at different points in the movie. Scotty is a lovable goof and a bit out there in personality, a perfect role for Pegg. Urban's McCoy, on the other hand, is a bit grouchier, but his cynicism and exasperation with his friend and his appointed captain lead to some hilarious lines.<br/><br/>The only expectantly bad performance of the film is Eric Bana's as the villain Nero. In his first scene, Bana isn't too awful, but the next scenes featuring his character prove that his silence in the first is the only reason he manages to look menacing at all. Each time he speaks, Bana's Nero looks almost tame as a villain. Crazy, but tame.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the special effects and costumes were great, with the exclusion of one badly-painted green alien that was a throwback to the old ""Star Trek"" series. Outerspace looked beautiful and the pizza-cutter ship called the Enterprise wasn't too shabby-looking either. Plenty of ugly aliens and monsters make their appearances in the film as well, and don't be surprised if a few of them make you jump out of your seat.<br/><br/>My one qualm with the film is the lack of strong female characters. Only Uhuru (Zoe Saldana) has a big role in the film, but aside from her linguistic skills, she served only as eye candy in a short skirt. Other characters, like the mothers (Jennifer Morrison and Winona Ryder) of Kirk and Spock, make very few appearances in the film, and none of them are ever really involved in saving Earth from the Romulans. Hopefully, there will be a bigger role for a female character in the sequel.<br/><br/>With its epic feel and its non-stop action, ""Star Trek"" is certainly an enjoyable film. So forget preconceptions about the previous movies and television shows. The new film is a great in its own right and can stand alone from its predecessors."

","After all the hype I found this movie disappointing. So much so that I left about ten minutes before the end.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, I suspect the reason is that the original Star Trek TV series rose above the slightly shonky sets, KMart uniforms and balsa model animations because of the concepts ""debated"" in the episodes. Chain of command, captains' responsibilities and so on made what was a pretty run-of-the-mill series into something worth wondering about.<br/><br/>Now we have breathtaking effects and CGI battles, bangs and the like. (Except the transporter effects - how come the TV transporters looked as if they worked while this film appeared as if they'd been drawn in by a toddler?) But I think these effects were the downfall of the film. I got the distinct impression that they sat down and worked out how to make the bangs louder, the explosions explosier and the black holes holier - and then looked at each other and said ""now how are we going to tie all those effects together? D'you think we need some sort of story line? Howsabout if .......<br/><br/>Five out of ten - for the bangs!"

","I must say I was very, very disappointed by this movie. I had read a lot of critical praise for it, and not seen much in the way of negative comment, so I expected it to be a least fairly good. Unfortunately this was not so. Frankly it seemed to me mostly a load of distasteful sensationalism, that did nothing but harm to the Star Trek vision. Of course it has plenty of fancy special effects - although they do seem to lean heavily towards a lot of flashing coloured swirls. And the acting is thoroughly professional - given the script, I don't think the actors can be faulted at all. They do excellent work with what's available to them. But the whole direction seems a complete disaster to me. Really I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised or disappointed. This is entirely consistent with Abrams' previous performance. I have to admit I've found all his previous output pretty much intolerable, with the possible exception of parts of Felicity. But I don't really have any emotional investment in, for example, Mission Impossible, so I didn't much care if he made a mess of that - other than the fact that film was just extremely unpleasant, and generally a negative contribution to the human race. I care more about this, because I really do think that Star Trek was worth saving from being reduced to this kind of nasty trash. Ah well, nothing is safe in this universe. As Spock might say, we must try to avoid emotional involvement, and rationally all we can do is try our best to encourage positive alternatives. As a final note, though, I truly am shocked that this movie didn't get much more negative response, especially from fans of the real Star Trek (fairly multifarious though that may be... but I certainly wouldn't include this unpleasant misbirth)."

But it was oval in the simulator. * The front view screen which doesn't show items in comparable<br/><br/>dimensions, but instead stretches the picture horizontally (??)<br/><br/>And, it also shows the stars moving L to R, instead of toward <br/><br/>the ship (or away from it, in a reverse view). * An Engineering Deck composed of nondescript walls and pipes <br/><br/>with no nomenclature and an antiquated, no-obvious-<br/><br/>purpose layout - and no work stations, screens, monitoring <br/><br/>devices shown. * Scenes of the ship are edited too short and don't lend <br/><br/>to establishing a realistic heft, mass & rock solidness<br/><br/>as it moves across the screen. <br/><br/>The actors fit the very basic guidelines - and the good story is compacted, making it difficult to pick up character development.<br/><br/>And - so it goes."

","This film blew me away when I first saw it many years ago, at how much it was different from TOS but at the same time drawing many, many parallels. The acting is superb, with all the leads having moments to shine reflecting their predecessors (which they do very well). The CGI is impeccable, and Giacchino
score is remarkable. The Romulans are once again the baddies in this fast paced film, with Eric Bana taking the lead with many memeable scenes which are absolutely fantastic! The film strays far from the regular Trek film as it has more action the the whole of TOS put together, and every ship is more supersized than a McD's meal. It is sad to see that in the long run this film killed Star Trek as we knew it (talking 'bout you Klutztzman) but that is not entirely this films fault.<br/><br/>The story is engaging, with many fan service moments but it doesn't feel overwhelming. Danger to those who hate change however, as this film has done so. All said and done, I would take this over Picard and STD any day. This film is the complete opposite of the Motion Picture, but it's similar in the fact that it doesn't feel like Star Trek. However, both ST'09 and the Motion Picture were able to kick start the franchise after a multiple year hiatus.<br/><br/>All in all, this film does what it does well. There will always people who are angry at JJ for this film, but it's not a bad film and it's got Leonard Nimoy. What's not to like?"
"superstition2","1","8","16","11 February 2010"," Pure garbage
","This film is alright if you're a little kid who doesn't want a film that's as good as something like the Dark Crystal. In fact... why not rent that instead? <br/><br/>Not even kids should be subjected to this dreck. It's a bad cartoon masquerading as a Star Trek film. There's nothing in it but the flimsiest of bad characters, a plot even a 4th grader could have done better with, and a flavor that makes Aspartame seem enticing.<br/><br/>Someone called this ""ADHD addled"". Addled is a great word for it. All action without conflict. To have conflict, you have to have a legitimate problem. This film's only problem is that the cameras are rolling.<br/><br/>People have compared this with the very disappointing Episode 1, and the comparison is pretty apt. Both films dumbed down to a target kiddie audience. But, Episode 1 is the better film, marginal as it was. At least it had better visuals and a few minimally interesting moments. Trying not to laugh when a teenage girl in a goofy faux-Asian getup pretends to be ""oh-so-serious"" in a monotone is one of them. Seeing children lead the adults -- a walking commercial for products, is also amusing. There is none of this even marginal aesthetic appeal here. It's a TV movie compressed into a bad commercial. It's bad because you can't even identify the product.<br/><br/>The saddest thing of all is the utter butchery of Spock's character. These people couldn't rest until they destroyed the most interesting person in the original series. It's a good thing Gene and Majel didn't have to see this.<br/><br/>I'm asking myself why I devoted to many words to this ""film"". As with watching it, there's no way to get that time back. A better review would just be one sentence: ""don't bother""."
"XweAponX","10","8","16","21 November 2009"," I was against this movie from the start!
","I even missed it in the Theatre. But thought about it, my mistake! Why deprive myself of something I grew up on, Something I have loved? To tell the truth I was curious, I wanted to see how JJ Abrams treated this ""Sacred Cow"". I had seen Fan reaction, Trek GEEKS stating that they WOULD NOT see this film. Well, I am a Trekker, but not a GEEK and I usually accept change, so, I bought this as soon as I had 25 bucks in my pocket.<br/><br/>TREK had Devolved especially in the last 15 years of the syndicated shows like Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise. I had thought Enterprise was just going backward, why tell THAT story? WHY make another FEATURE Film telling the Kirk/Spock story AGAIN? But anyone thinking that immediately loses the point: That in fact, this is NOT that same TREK Universe - It is irrevocably CHANGED.<br/><br/>I was a huge fan if The Next Generation and the four films based in That Universe. I extremely enjoyed Star Trek: Nemesis: It was good writing, good acting, great story, and written by John Logan and directed by Stuart Baird. But as much as I liked that film, nobody else liked it. So, when I heard about this project - I thought, these guys have run out of road? No more new story to write, so they go backward? Feh! Until I saw the first scene of this film - Everything happens... Bad Guys come, Huge Space battle... And Kirk gets BORN- Effectively changing TREK History.<br/><br/>Now, we have had Trek episodes (City on the Edge of Forever from TOS and Time's Arrow from The Next Generation) where the past gets changed And guys from the future have to go back and change it back.<br/><br/>But the focus of THIS trek is NOT ""The Guys in the Future who haplessly have to go into the past and change it back"" - Those guys do not exist yet! We don't ever see those guys... Those guys no longer exist! And all of Trek History from TOS... NEVER HAPPENED.<br/><br/>And THAT fact gives this film great promise - As a NEW Beginning.<br/><br/>We have one, and only one Link with that TOS/NEXT GEN/DS9/VOYAGER universe with it's Cardassian War and Dominion War and BORG: That is Leonard Nimoy as Spock PRIME. But Spock is also played by Zachary Quinto who could be Leonard Nimoy's TWIN, Or Son. Or Clone! This film is an abundance of riches as far as talent: Bruce Greenwood is Captain Chris Pike. Eric Bana as ""The Bad Guy"" Captain Nero. I do not know Chris Pine who plays Kirk, but I DO Know Simon Pegg/Shaun of the Dead- Who Flawlessly plays Scotty (w/little alien pet).<br/><br/>Winona Ryder as Amanda Grayson/Spock's Mom - I did not know it was she! And if you look carefully at the Vulcan council Members: You see Writer Akiva Goldsman. A stand-out is when Spock is standing before the Vulcan Science Council, who is the minister but the great character actor W. Morgan Sheppard? He goes uncredited in the film.<br/><br/>My favourite piece of casting is Karl Urban as ""Bones"" - A LONG way from Rohan in Lord of the Rings. His Dr. McCoy is flawless - Including facial expressions and sardonic/sarcastic remarks ""Are you out of your Vulcan Mind!"" Clifton Collin's Jr (Traffic) as Bad Guy #2 - Rounds out a class cast. One other little Abramism of note: IN a scene where ""Simon Pegg/Scotty"" uses the Transporter Trick to retrieve Kirk, Pike and Spock from two different locations onto the same Transporter pad - Standing right next to Simon Pegg is none other than Chris Doohan - James Doohan's son: An Homage to Departed Members of the TOS Enterprise Crew.<br/><br/>Although ""this is not your daddy's Trek"" - There are HOMAGES to Trek and earlier episodes and the ten earlier films. Check Kirk eating an apple while he takes a certain ""test"" - Spock Prime saying ""I have been and shall always be your friend"" to a Kirk that had never gone back to Genesis to pick him up.<br/><br/>Now it is interesting to note, that NOT ONE member of Rick Berman's TREK Production crew are present. Not one script supervisor, not one AD, not one writer. This film is ALL JJ Abrams. Despite that apparent handicap, he SEAMLESSLY references that original Trek 'Verse.<br/><br/>There are NO slow spots in this film. There is one ""Luke Skywalker on Tattoine"" moment where Kirk is looking at the Unfinished Enterprise in Iowa. We can surmise that Because of Eric Bana's visit from the future, changing Kirk's Birth and everything else... The USS Enterprise is different.<br/><br/>With that as the premise... Then TREK gets a complete reboot with this film, and if Paramount wanted to, they could go BACK, and re-tell ALL of that story of Kirk/Spock... Which would mean, all of The Next Generation could be retold? All of Deep Space Nine? As much as I was against telling ""Yet Another Kirk/Spock Story"" - I cannot refute the LOGIC of this new ""Parallel Trek Verse"" - And in fact, THIS Trek is an unrelenting, fast moving Epic... It never lets up, not for a second. It is Trek handed to Abrams with Paramounts Blessing and Abrams doing AMAZING things.<br/><br/>I have to admit... As much as I hated this film when it came out... I LOVE this film, especially NOW, that I have it on DVD and I can watch scenes and scrutinize it frame by frame. I hated this film violently - And I LOVE this film just as violently! Everything about this Trek is a NEW Trek. A Fresh Trek... And I hope that Abrams gets to do it again! And NEXT time. I'll see it in the Theatre!"

Maybe they had a good laser show, and smoke and lots of hot women in the audience, but still, the music stank. In a situation like that I would also get a headache. Not sure which would be worse, Creed or Star Trek. Hmmmm...<br/><br/>Star Trek had lot's of lens flares. If you like lens flares you may like Star Trek. Depends on what you're looking for in a movie, I guess...<br/><br/>On the plus side, it was very loud and had a lot of CGI and no JarJar Binks. The plot was ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional. My popcorn's butter was probably not real butter but still tasty.

"siderite","5","32","86","13 May 2009"," Oh, it was crap. Pure and simple.
","You might say that as an ardent hater of Lost I may be biased, but actually I didn't heed my own advice and I read some reviews about the movie. They were all cautiously favourable so that mellowed down my low expectations of the movie. I mean J.J.Abrams and young ST TOS crew? Come on! But I bought it and I even wen to the cinema to see it. Don't get me started on that!<br/><br/>So, where there good parts in it? Of course there were. That's what makes it so annoying. With casting like Zachary Quinto, who secretly I believe could make a very good actor if given half a decent role, Karl Urban, even Eric Bana. I have no idea what Ben Cross and Winona Ryder did in this film, but they also added some value to it. Funny enough, the only player that felt Star Trekish was Bruce Greenwood who I can easily imagine on par with Patrick Stewart in a true Master and Commander meets Star Trek film (which we all know it is what the next movie should be about).<br/><br/>Alas, the bad parts overwhelm the good ones. The Star Trek science was always dodgy, especially the one in the original series, but this one was neither true to the series nor close to anything we learn in school about science. I am talking about basic physics here, not something complicated like college! The action scenes were decent, but the style of always moving with the projectile and changing angles in a complete cacophony of loud and improbable sounds made them almost unbearable. The script? It had so many holes in it you just couldn't see any material left. The characters are completely different from the original crew. Almost nothing is left from Gene Roddenberry's legacy.<br/><br/>Bottom line: no, it's not as bad as Andromeda, but it's heading there. A film made only for memory deficient teenagers with cultural Attention Deficit Disorder. I could go on and on and on. As I said I really liked the performances of Bruce Greenwood and Eric Bana. You barely recognised the man. But other than that, nothing is worth the destruction of a mythos almost half a century old."

","When the Romulan mining ship Narada attacks the Federation starship US Kelvin, Captain George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) substitutes his captain, who is going to meet the Romulan Captain Nero (Eric Bana) in his vessel to negotiate a cease fire, in the command of the US Kelvin. He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife that is in labor; while she delivers their son James Tiberus Kirk in the hospital shuttle-craft, George Kirk crashes the US Kelvin against the Narada. The reckless and troublemaker Kirk grows up and when he meets Capt. Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) in a bar fight, he is invited to join the Starfleet. Meanwhile in Vulcan, the outcast Spock grows-up discriminated by his half-human condition. They meet each other in the Starfleet Academy, where Spock (Zachary Quinto) accuses Kirk (Chris Pine) of lack of ethics, cheating a test of command. The trial is suspended with the information that Vulcan is under attack and the Federation starships head to Vulcan, including the recently commissioned USS Enterprise. Kirk, who is a stowaway, foresees an alien attack and advises Captain Spike; however, the Enterprise is damaged and when Captain Spike travels to meet Captain Nero, Spock assumes the bridge and has a serious friction with Kirk after the destruction of Vulcan. Kirk is accused of mutiny and stranded in the desert planet Delta Vega. Out of the blue, he is saved from an attack of an alien animal by an old Spock that explains to him that Captain Nero blames him and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet Romulus by a supernova. Spock explains that he had failed with the creation of a black hole with red matter to consume the supernova and Nero is seeking revenge. Now Kirk has to find a way to save Earth, the next destination of Narada.<br/><br/>As a fan of the original TV series since the 60's, I was reluctant to see this updated version expecting the worst. However, my daughter convinced me to watch the DVD and I found a never disappointing beginning of the saga of the cult-series. The pace and budget of this movie, with lots of action and special effects, are totally different from the almost theatrical TV shows. But J.J. Abrams succeeds in maybe the most important characteristic of the original series: the charisma of the characters. It is amazing how Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, the underrated Bruce Greenwood and the young cast keep the chemistry of the original characters with the viewer. Further, the story and the screenplay are excellent, with witty dialogs and funny situations. Maybe purists do not like this version, but in the end, I was delighted with this movie. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Star Trek"""
"M_I_Goff","6","10","22","8 May 2009"," SpaceBalls for Trekkers
","I thought this was a great movie, very entertaining. But not in the same way that I thought movies 2 through 9 were great movies; more along the lines of Space Balls or UHF. Don't get me wrong, the story was interesting and the action kept me on the edge of my seat. And once it was revealed that the entire story takes place in an alternate time line I was able to appreciate the movie even more now that I was no longer asking every why every other scene was contradicting established Trek history. But the characters in this film seemed like spoofs of the beloved characters we love. In much the same same way that Mel Brooks royally spoofed Star Wars with Spaceballs (1987) and Weird Al royally spoofed Ghandi and other classics with UHF (1989), most of the crew became mere caricatures of their counterparts from the TV show and first six films. From McCoy showing up as a morbidly pessimistic hypochondriac and becoming almost mad scientist-like in the way he keeps injecting Kirk to get rid of the effects of previous injection, to Checkov speaking with such an overly Russian accent that the computer could not understand him. <br/><br/>I did enjoy this movie just as I did with Spaceballs and UHF. Actually this Star Trek movie is a step above the other films I mention here. <br/><br/>In spite of the fact (or maybe partly because of the fact) that I find myself wondering if JJ Abrams had asked comedians Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder for help recreating these people I thought it was a great movie."
"gunflyer","10","7","14","3 June 2011"," You couldn't ask for a better reboot
","I've been having to think about this for quite a while. People have been getting on my case about me thinking this is one of the best Star Trek films in the entire series(It's right up there with Wrath of Khan in my opinion). I've had more than enough time to think about this, and I think the best answer that I can give is that because of the scope of the story, the grand, epic scale and nature and the characters involved, this picture is big. It's almost too big to be a movie.<br/><br/>The science doesn't bother me. The details don't bug me because in my opinion they don't really detract from the story or bring up a way in which the crew could have stopped Nero. Talking of Nero, people have been demanding to know his motivations. I will keep insisting to you until the day I die that sometimes people do stupid, psychotic, evil and massively, mind-blowingly irresponsible things for reasons far beyond us. They do that in the real world too, and it certainly isn't improbable they wouldn't use whatever means at their disposal to reek revenge, no matter how crazy it may seem.<br/><br/>What matters is that there is a threat to every federation planet, and Kirk must not just deal with Spock, but he must come to terms with himself and realize he can't be a selfish jackass anymore, he has to step up and do what is right not for himself but for everyone. It's nice to see after all the conflict Spock and Kirk went through that their legendary friendship is beginning to blossom.<br/><br/>It was nice to have Spock prime there for a reason. His being there wasn't a result of being shoe-horned, but as a result of actual dramatic necessity. Spock Prime is there for a reason, and I honestly don't know if he will or how he will aid the Spock and Kirk of the past, we'll just have to wait and see.<br/><br/>What matters is that the story is big, it's fast-paced, it's never boring, there's always something going on. From the minute Kirk's father charges heroically to save hundreds of lives from Nero as he says goodbye to his wife and newly born child, you're emotionally invested. You know who this little boy is going to grow up to be.<br/><br/>This movie is a game changer. It takes the crew of the great original series and gives them a new lease on life with potentially endless stories that will no doubt thrill and excite us all. I just hope the writers can keep up this frantic pace."

This version of the character was despicable and in no way heroic. He was a loud, out-of-control jerk that someone should have smacked around - a lot. I kept wishing someone would kill him off.<br/><br/>The original series had heart and soul. This thing had neither. The original did not have mind blowing effects, but instead had mind blowing things to contemplate. AS far as I'm concerned, the franchise has lost the most important part of what was ""Star Trek"". I guess that's commercialism at it's finest. For me it had very little going for it with the exception of a few fun performances which weren't enough to keep me seated through the entire thing. I walked out."

","While some of the casting and character development is surprisingly dead on (which explains my ""2"" rating), overall this movie was a poorly done bastardization of a wonderful story line the original television and movie franchise were. Frankly, it should be banned EVERYWHERE and the perpetrators of this tragedy should be publicly impaled as an abject lesson to any who wish to destroy an original story with idiotic and stupid interpretations. The only interpretation of a story which I found to be more revolting was Peter Jackson's hack job of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>This film completely disregarded nearly every episode of the original TV program, recreated events of the story-line in a manner that was , to say the least. lame and imbecilic the the ""Nth"" degree. They even had the gall fabricate a completely bogus and unbelievable love interest between two characters that never (nor would have) existed in the original series. Also, characters were included/introduced out of sequence in such an insipid and ham-handed manner as to defame Gene Roddenberry's originally creation completely. I only shudder to think what would be next on this ""teams"" agenda: Jesus have carnal knowledge of his mother?<br/><br/>This movie was, at best, appalling and I can only take solace in the fact I didn't shell out good money to go see it in the theater.

"WeeClaude","3","5","9","27 November 2017"," Another of life's little disappointments
","Good grief, is this silly action movie really the highest-rated Star Trek film on IMDb? Higher than Wrath of Khan, First Contact, and the amusing whale one from the 80s? How revolting!<br/><br/>Star Trek 2009 is one of those films that demands absolutely nothing of its audience. It's all pretty people, explosions, and pretty people causing explosions. What little plot there is, is surprisingly nerdy - did they really need to include two timelines and two Spocks? And I suppose it would be churlish to point out that the storyline is recycled from the previous, much-loathed Star Trek film, Nemesis (a Romulan guy in a big spaceship heads toward Earth to blow it up).<br/><br/>For years, I had to listen to people talk about what a wonderful reboot this is, and isn't it great that Star Trek is finally cool and popular and mainstream, blah blah. Well, now that Star Trek: Into Darkness was a box office disappointment, and Star Trek: Beyond was a miserable box office failure, is it okay to look back at this 2009 scrapheap and admit that maybe it *wasn't* so great? <br/><br/>I think the sequels were box office disappointments, because nobody really cared about these characters and their stories. They were amused by this shallow reboot only for the duration of one movie! Eat your popcorn, go home, and forget the whole thing happened, right? Pretty feeble compared to the massive pop-culture impact of classic Trek.<br/><br/>I know what this film's defenders will say - this is still the most financially successful version of Star Trek ever made. To which I would reply, ""only sort of."" The economics of blockbuster films have changed since the 1980s. Back in the day, Wrath of Khan could be considered a big success when it cost 11 million bucks and made $97 million (unadjusted for inflation, of course). Khan's 9x return on investment made it far more profitable than, say, this movie or Star Trek Beyond, which lost money! Also, the first four Trek films were all among the top 10 movies of their respective years at the U.S. box office. You can't say the same for the reboot Treks, which underperform compared to rival blockbuster franchises.<br/><br/>Indeed, Star Trek remains - and always will be - less popular than other major film franchises. That's because it's nerdy and brainy, and that's a good thing! We need nerdy Star Trek as an antidote to all the stupid entertainment out there.<br/><br/>Which is why this film's dumbing down of Trek is unacceptable. And, considering how much they dumbed it down, this new series has been remarkably unsuccessful. Shatner and Nimoy would never have lost the box-office battle to Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and King Kong! If you're going to go dumb, at least have the dignity to make $750,000,000 and guarantee a sequel..."

But i decided to watch the new one on DVD. I was quite familiar with the story line and i knew the characters Kirk, Spock and Scotty.......somehow. But the thing about reboots is that its not relevant to know anything about the old ones, so i thought fu*k it, ill just watch it with an open mind and see if i enjoy it.And did i enjoy........I loved it!<br/><br/>The film starts with our main guy Kirk being born and took to earth to be raised by his mother. When he comes of age he decides that he wants to join the starfleet academy, so he can try to become a captain of his own ship, like his father before he. He meets Spock (portrayed brilliantly by Zachary Quinto) and later on Scotty (simon Pegg - brilliant as always. they team up to try and stop an alien race from destroying planets. They destroy planets by creating black holes which is cool! <br/><br/>This really is a new star trek franchise aimed at a new generation.

What is missing is the soul - like a zombie who still looks and speaks like the person he once was, but has lost its soul. That what made him himself is missing, it's a hull filled with something else. In this case it is filled with the fast-paced plot. Very easy to understand for people who don't watch Sci-Fi on television, fast-paced so that even people with a low attention span can enjoy it, but all in all a bit brain dead.<br/><br/>There is nothing of the utopian Federation world the series featured in the past, nothing of the deep humanism I came to love."
"steben","6","5","9","30 June 2009"," Average action entertainment
","I don't think I've seen many balanced opinions, people seem to either love or hate this movie. Personally, I don't see what the fuss is all about: I remember the original Star Trek always just made me laugh, whether Kirk was being seduced by people in ancient costumes or wrestling with green lizards that made Ed Wood saucers look fairly plausible; my nostalgic adherence to it comes solely from the fact that when I used to watch it, I was much younger and living in happier times. So, no, I wouldn't like to watch exactly this kind of product in a movie theater again, and I got nothing to mourn.<br/><br/>Yes, the new movie is as dumb as action movies go these days, with characters that offer as much depth as your average tea cup and a plot that defies the definition of plot in any explanatory dictionary. Still, I liked the way it looked, and the music is very solid. You really need to turn your brain off, tho. Expect a simple action movie. A bit better than XXX, a bit less credible, with approximately the same message: when you see a guy who says that he wants to kill everybody, you need to smash his face. Yep. Hope they hire some waaaaay better writers for the sequel, really. Know it's not going to happen."

","I would like to start by saying that I am not a Star Trek fan, I am a film fan and as a film this sucked. Yes the special effects were brilliant but it was horribly acted, predictable, boring, and the story was just ridiculous. I mean this is a huge film, with a huge budget you would think they would create a story to match, something grand and epic But they didn't. Instead they went with a bland and uninteresting story that failed at every opportunity to drag me in or even keep my attention for more than two minutes.<br/><br/>This wasn't enough though, having bored me half to sleep they decided it would be good to irritate me with endless barrage of stupid dialogue read seemingly by a bunch of zombies. I'm afraid I had reached my limit and walked out about twenty minutes before the end feeling both ripped off and disappointed.<br/><br/>Waste of money."
"diego_castro_95","1","25","68","17 May 2009"," What about the characters?????!!!
","OK, first of all I must say I am not a trekkie, I barely know what star trek means and the only reason I went to the theater to see this movie was because of the so called acclamation of IMDb's users towards it erroneously locating it #69!!! WTF! Better than Fellini's 8½ and 2001: A Space Odyssey?? Or Chinatown??? (not mentioning the entire list). My problems with my movie are the following 1. Although the actors try and make an effort, the few scenes with dialog and character's story are disastrous. We scarcely get to know mr. kirk and what we get to know is nothing but clichés. Wow he jumps of the car and then climbs in the edge of the cliff, excuse me how is this relevant to the story???? Then we just get to know he is a ""fight club"" sort of guy, that he is a ""rebel"" and that's it. That's it. And Spock is a man who doesn't seem to care 6 billion people dies (a phrase which is constantly repeated but still didn't impact neither me nor the characters in the screen). And then we don't know at what moment he gets engaged with the Uhura girl, who's first name remains unknown for half of the film ""OH HOW FUNNY JAJAJAJ"" Ehhmmm.... NO. But then you say, isn't the story interesting. NO. The villain's revenge is such a plain thing, and so is him. ""Oh you let my planet be destroyed now I'll destroy yours buahahah"". Haven't we heard that many times??. And so the story continues and then has a big plot hole relating time travel which half the theater didn't understand. The movie ends as everyone knew it would end and it leaves nothing to you but a ""We should've stayed home and rent something."" 2. There is this terribly written screenplay full of phrases such as: ""I married your mother because I loved her"" (Douh!) or many other ones that only make you wish the movie was over. The rest is just pretty well done, i must say, BAM BAM, BUM, BUM, CRASH! etc etc. But in a nutshell, star trek is a movie that is so clichéd and so desperately willing to amuse you that never accomplishes an specific goal or message just a waste of time and money."
"remyjaudoin","5","8","17","19 April 2020"," As someone who got into Star Trek recently
","I can say I remembered this movie to be better. The first time I watched it, I had never seen anything Star Trek related. I only knew very few things about the lore and characters. At the time, I think I was pretty satisfied with my movie going experience, thinking it was a decent, fun action movie.<br/><br/>Now, I've watched the entirety of the original series, I've seen movies 1 to 6 of the original timeline, and I'm currently going through ""the next generation"".<br/><br/>I can say my opinion has changed.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie is awful, but it felt pretty disappointing. It's not bad, just very, very bland and predictable. It's a pure Hollywood product.<br/><br/>It certainly lacks that very specific vibe Star Trek usually has when it's done right. That ""je ne sais quoi"" which made the original cast work so well. Of course, there's the disadvantage of not having eighty episodes to build the relationships between the characters. It is obvious you can't make your characters quite as likeable in a two-hour or so runtime.<br/><br/>Kirk and Spock are also pretty different from the original show. It seems logical since this is a modern reinterpretation, they had to change some stuff along the way. Plus it's better that than having the actors trying too hard to be like Nimoy and Shatner, which could have been very forced. But once again, it does lack the charm of the original cast. However, I really liked karl Urban as McCoy, I think he really succeeds in acting like grumpy DeForest Kelley without it being forced. Also props to John Cho and Anton Yelchin (rest in peace) who were very good as Sulu and Chekov, and the rest of the cast who were very decent in my opinion.<br/><br/>I liked the first scene with the USS Kelvin though, It was a tense and exciting opener, and worked better than most of the action sequences that followed.<br/><br/>I know it's not entirely fair to compare the original show and this movie for many reasons, but even on its own, the movie lacks much in substance. I kind of felt disconnected from most of what happened, I very rarely felt the impact of the supposedly dramatic moments. I don't think it is such a bad idea to destroy Vulcan and kill Spock's mother, but it didn't shake me like it should have. And it's probably because a two-hour movie isn't enough to make us care about these characters. Maybe if they did it later in the series, idk.<br/><br/>It is a great mystery to me how the first Star Trek movie from 1979 is rated 6.4 on Imdb, it had much more personnality in my opinion.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was pretty cool though. The main theme for the movie is epic (but, I mean, coming from Michael Giacchino, it doesn't surprise me).<br/><br/>(PS. Everyone and their mother has already said it, but could you chill with the lens flares J.J.?)"
"Abusimble1","1","90","289","5 May 2009"," The Death Of Star Trek
","As Hollywood movies got infested with and are now replete with shallow plots, feminism and lewd dialogue, I was hoping that the Star Trek series would escape from the same demise. Star Trek: Nemesis was actually the foreboding film that this last bastion protecting normal television was being reconnoitered for a full-scale assault by greedy executives. Nemesis was an experiment for this movie. Hollywood believed that if Nemesis got a good reception it would pave the way for a new Star Trek. Nemesis didn't get a good reception from anyone liking the original Star Trek but it got great reviews from 15 year olds who like seeing big explosions on the screen.<br/><br/>""Star Trek (2009)"" is not Star Trek. It is a passable action movie and that is all. In fact, most of the battle scenes are overdone and make the viewer think he's watching a crate of fireworks that has gone off. This alone means the movie cannot co-exist in a man's mind juxtaposed with the idea of Star Trek. Nor can it be considered a new type of Star Trek because that would require radically altering the original's definition. <br/><br/>Like ""The Dark Knight"", this movie seeks to replace vital elements which were present in every title before it. ""The Dark Knight"" was a misrepresentation of Batman and this movie is no different. Commonalities which are inherent to Star Trek and which are expected by the viewer so he can concentrate on the plot, are gone. The most conspicuous of these changes is in the characters. <br/><br/>James T. Kirk, a great strategist, is shown as an undisciplined law-breaking stuntman with nary a thought to his tactical skills being honed. There is one hackneyed scene with him looking at a mountain as if that is enough to make him into a great captain. 27 year old Spock is shown as a warrior Vulcan and far more aggressive than someone who would really understand logic, as expected to by his age. The others don't fare much better. Chekov acts a bumbling fool whose sole purpose is to provide comic relief for the tension between Kirk and Spock. Scotty and Ahura seem immature for their ages. Again, it must be emphasised that if these weren't supposed to be established Star Trek characters there would be no issues, other than the big one of sending a very bad message to schoolchildren.<br/><br/>There are two other major problems: The special effects and fights. Within the first 5 minutes there is a doomsday encounter between a starship and a Romulan warbird. The special effects for this sequence make the viewer feel as if he's watching a video game. The ships look drawn by hand and then water-colourised. Perhaps to portend this, ""Bad Robot"", the team responsible for much the computer imagery, had a distinctly shabby logo in the opening credits. The battle itself resembles the birthday party of an inebriated mob of psychotics. It's as if the director wanted to maximise the amount of action shown with little regard to plot. Here was a veritable fest of badly-lit destruction, the first of many. Phasers fire everywhere without seeming to acquire targets. Panels from the starship are blown off repeatedly by enemy fire. The ship is also shown very close up while all this is happening. It leads to the viewer feeling nauseous and numb. Rather than enriching the movie as carefully crafted battle scenes do, like in Star Trek II and Star Trek III, it makes a normal audience sensitised to further violence.<br/><br/>I shan't countenance the ruin of a great franchise. This film suffers from serious defects and it is a disgrace to have the Star Trek name associated with it."

","If you are a fan of the original Star Trek, there is very little of it here. The character development gives a completely different take on the crew's origins. I did not like the new twists on everyone's background. Very poorly acted too, but I did enjoy Zoe Saldana. There is also a plot element to explain why everything is different. Plot-wise, not an enjoyable story.<br/><br/>The only two highlights of the film for me was Leonard Nimoy and the look of the Enterprise. But they made the ship look too high tech. It looks like it could run circles around the Enterprise D.

For some unforeseen reason it was transformed into a right and has become grossly abused. I consider myself to be a advent Star Trek fan, and after watching what I believe to be a very successful movie, the final analysis is the J.J. has resurrected a franchise that seem to have lost its swagger and energy, we have seen many TV shows and 2 generation of Star Trek crews in movies, and for some reason we were left feeling empty, but this movie completely fills that void. The movie plot was Gene Roddenberry all the way, Star Trek is Sci-fi, therefore the plot must have a few tablespoons of absurdity mixed in, the action sequences, the dialogue is Star Trek. Start to finish I believe this team put together by J.J did a great job resurrecting what I believe was a dying franchise which had years of success.

Besides the fact that the whole concept is ridiculous (could just imagine a huge well type thing reeling up the several meter thick cable inside the mining ship) Why wouldn't Vulcan or Earth just shoot the damn thing from the surface, or send some shuttles or anything. Even a missile of todays technology could have done the job. The dialogues were also a bit superficial with none of the witty humor that defined the first few original crew movies. The scene where Bones confronts Spock about having sent Kirk from the ship was pretty painful to listen to, You could have at least acted like it was a hard decision.... ouch, not sure why that particular line bothered me so much but perhaps its because remembering the original bones think he would have a much wittier response. Anyways thats enough ranting, I'm voting 1 as believe the rating is waaaaay too high even though overall was O.K. and bearable to watch and the potential is there for something better to emerge if there is ever to be a continuation with this cast."

"Jimrsjdm","4","6","12","13 December 2009"," Not faithful to the original
","I thought the idea for this movie had tremendous potential (ie, taking the series back to its origins) and the new actors did a nice job with the tall task of playing legendary characters. However, I thought the writers and producers sabotaged the original 'Trek' with this effort, carelessly jamming together elements from Star Trek lore while not hitting the right emotional chords. There were numerous factual inconsistencies with the original series - which might be explained away with the ""new time line"" idea in the movie, but the changes were radical enough to create the impression that the writers were just sloppy or didn't really care. <br/><br/>With regard to the depiction of Captain Kirk - it's fine to paint him as heroic and bigger than life, but his unlikely ascent to power in this movie strains credulity, even for sci-fi. The character of Kirk, while heroic and intrepid, should have been portrayed as a much more believable person and maybe shown to be a bit more mature and responsible - which would have been much more in line with the original series. All in all, this movie -- as a possible introduction to a new set of films -- is disappointing, but I will hope that subsequent films will be better, if writers and producers can discipline themselves just a bit!"
"Vishal_s_kumar","10","6","12","10 December 2009"," You are fully capable of deciding your own destiny.
","In 2009, a new film with a new cast portraying old favorites returned to the series' roots to explore strange new worlds populated not by new civilizations but more complex and understandably functional sets and wondrous special effects that improve not on the spirit but certainly the look and feel of the old classics while delivering a film that at once both satisfies the demands of longtime fans and welcomes newcomers eager to accept this version of ""Star Trek"". Smartly and effortlessly blending the new with the old, maintaining the spirit of series creator Gene Roddenberry's vision but at the same time providing to the material a fresh and modern approach, Director J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is more than a summer blockbuster; it's a rekindling of an important milestone in Science Fiction while at the same time boldly plotting a new course towards a limitless, fascinating, and exciting universe of possibilities.<br/><br/>Not delving much into the plot, the biggest challenge facing a reboot of Star Trek -- particularly on this scale -- was threefold: the necessary re-casting of iconic characters, the re-design of the Enterprise, and the explanation as to the hows and whys of the differences between the 2009 edition of Star Trek and the long-established and cherished history of the people, places, and things of years past. Abrams' vision succeeds at each level. While the film might have gotten away with little-to-no regard for the latter -- the explanation for the altered reality -- the film not only explains it away but also integrates the reason into the film as the primary plot device. In addition, this is not the first time that ""Star Trek"" has seen itself drastically altered. Abrams' too does that, considering his masterful job of exploring both sides equally in Star Trek, mentioning Starfleet's purpose of being a ""humanitarian and peacekeeping armada"" while at the same time including plenty of action and cementing it all in a decidedly militaristic structure.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Star Trek features a cast that might not absolutely resemble the actors that played in Gene Roddenberry's original ""Star Trek,"" but they each understand not only their character's mannerisms but also the importance to the fan base to portray them with a dignity and compassion. In fact, the filmmakers have integrated additional character traits into the story for both dramatic and humorous effect, and the script's understanding of the complexities of the characters further allows the actors to effectively portray them as fans demand. For instance, Sulu's (John Cho) prowess with the blade is utilized in one of the film's pivotal action sequences. Chekov (Anton Yelchin) struggles with the pronunciation of the letter ""v"" in what is the film's funniest scene. Actor Karl Urban delivers the closest approximation of his character through his effort as Dr. McCoy; the speech patterns, the catch phrases, and his attitude towards Spock make for an almost uncanny resemblance to what DeForrest Kelley did with the character. Bruce Greenwood's portrayal of Captain Pike steals the show; he's superb throughout, and his character, too, winds up reinforcing the film's themes of destiny as well as any other with a simple but highly effective nod to the ""Star Trek"" universe when all is said and done. Zoë Saldana's Uhura undergoes the most noticeable change from 1966 to now. She's scripted as a more important character with an attitude and surprise revelation that breaks the norms of established ""Trek"" lore but fit in nicely with the entirety of the film. Zachary Quinto both looks and acts the part of Commander Spock. Spock proves the most pivotal character in the film; his half-Vulcan, half-human heritage plays a crucial role in the movie, and his ability to command his half-human side proves vital to the outcome of the story. Quinto makes for the best Vulcan since Leonard Nimoy, fully understanding not only what it means to be Vulcan but also what it means to be Spock. As James T. Kirk, Chris Pine might be just a bit too rambunctious, but as the film develops, shades of William Shatner emerge, culminating with a scene at the end of the film that's unmistakably Kirk. There's not a bad performance to be found, and more importantly, there's not a badly-interpreted character in the film. This crew meshes about as well as the old crew, and given that this is their first go- round together, it seems destiny has more in store for them than simply one great film.<br/><br/>Finally, it's important to note just how strong the production is from top to bottom. J.J. Abrams' visual style fits in wonderfully with the tone, story, and themes of the film, not to mention the approach that nicely compliments the set design. The extensive use of lens flare might distract some, but it reinforces the bright interior of the Enterprise, which also plays in stark contrast to the ugliness of the Romulan vessel and the urgency and sadness that play crucial to the crux of the film. Abrams' approach to the material is respectful and graceful, but also aggressive. In addition, Star Trek's humor never falls flat or overwhelms the picture in any way. In fact, it generally enhances the tone, pace, and urgency of the film and the development of the story and its characters. Star Trek also delivers impeccable special effects. The ship and the action both are superbly realized in the digital realm, and there is no single effect that appears as anything less than perfect. Star Trek is perhaps the current pinnacle of special effects;sheer immersion, attention to detail, and absolute seamlessness, they don't come any better. Lastly, Michael Giacchino's score is elegant, strong, and endearing. Like the film, it enjoys its own identity but listeners familiar with the broad range of music found in the ""Star Trek"" universe will note subtle similarities that allow it to nicely integrate with the works of Alexander Courage, Jerry Goldsmith, Dennis McCarthy, and others."

","At some point many years ago, big budget summer films became devoted to the central theme of the Earth's destruction. This is now ubiquitous. Look at the summer lineup. Angels and Demons, Transformers 2, Terminator: Salvation, even the documentary ""Earth"". Usually there is a device that the bad guys want to obtain that can destroy the planet. The villain is of course mad, and wants revenge for some transgression we're about to have explained to us. Nearly everything follows the ""Paradise Lost"" mould that Wrath of Khan used so well. <br/><br/>Screenwriters don't seem to understand that the scale of vengeance doesn't have to be so massive to be effective, to create tension. Its about the two rivals in an opposition of mind and spirit, playing chess like warring titans, leveling mountains in their path. A nemesis might know everything that a lover knows, all of the vulnerabilities, only they're willing to cross the line and twist the knife, and say ""I told you so"". Eliminating this as a plot element makes the story mechanical. Who cares if the world is at stake if every soul in it is generic? Show me one soul worth caring about, and I'll teeter on the brink of my seat.<br/><br/>The actors in this seem to have been chosen because of their intrinsic youthfulness. Its almost the kind of stylization you'd find in Japanese manga, with the characters in younger form having bigger, more expressive eyes. No wonder that the story shows the new Kirk being delivered by a creature with larger than life eyes.<br/><br/>Everything is dialed up for the MTV crowd. Instead of the minimalist camera movement in the original films, there's a lot of orbiting and rotation around the characters. Everything is done to indicate that this is a modern action film, with average values. <br/><br/>To really deliver the point that we're in alien locations, the angles are more obtuse, even the lenses are fish-eye at times. Kirk drives a motorcycle, is basically Matt Damon as Good Will Hunting trying to become Buck Rogers. He gets into fights in loud bars, boozes up, and gets lippy with authority figures who try to drag him out of his loser lifestyle. Because of his latent Hero Gene, and nothing more, he ascends to greatness. <br/><br/>The writing only aspires to pantomime the original cast using recognizable phrases and plot elements. It doesn't expand the mythos, it just plays off of what the average fan will probably remember. No chances taken, and so its like patrolling the Galaxy in a pontoon boat, remembering a world so far away it must have happened in an alternate universe, where screenwriters had vision, and directors had balls."

","Before going to see this film I wondered what all the fuss was about. All I could hear was the new height this film achieved in cinema; this would be the best film of the summer etc. I went to see the film and came out feeling a bit cheated.<br/><br/>I thought that the film started on a high. The opening sequence was bright and kept you entertained. I also enjoyed the time transitions which showed Kirk growing and maturing. Howerver the scene where Young Kirk jump out of his car and onto the rock just in time, I mean come on guys, what are we, seven? <br/><br/>I thought that Chris pine and Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock, did well amongst a cast which performances which were average at best, surprisingly Simon Pegg was amongst these, and the Scottish accent was horrible. Whenever I heard it I cringe, he is a good actor but trying to put on a Scottish accent is most definitely one of his fortes. This is an example of the producers and director wanting a famous face and not bothering to see whether he is any good for the role. This brings me to quite nicely to my next point. Eric Bana. He did not intimidate me in the slightest, in fact he seemed quite nice to me. When Zero is the only enemy he must put the fear of 3 enemies into you and boy oh boy did Eric Bana not do that, his assistant who insisted on speaking for him at the being was far and away more intimidating the he was and he only spoke all of five lines.<br/><br/>The director spent a lot of time establishing the build up but forgot he had to deliver in the crucial moments, namely the battle to save earth. That final sequence, putting it mildly, was naff. It lasted all if 15 minutes give or take a few minutes, and winded up being pretty easy. I felt as if I had waited all this time for and epic ending and winded up a garden stroll, what massive disappointment.<br/><br/>Don’t get me wrong this film is not a failure, it is not a bad film but it is most defiantly not amazing. Maybe my expectations where to high or maybe it’s because I’ve never watched an episode of Star Trek, I do have a feeling that this will have a few Teak fans realling in disappointment. But after reading reviews and talking to friends I was fully expecting the Si-fi equivalent to Schindler's List which I most definitely wasn’t. Many people will disagree with me but this film made me write my fist ever film review and I’ve been clicking on this website 5 time a day every day for 3 years which is saying something."

Let's also discuss Chekov he did not actually join the cast of TOS until Season 2, how did he suddenly appear earlier? Not only that Christopher Pike never achieved the rank of Admiral, in TOS, he was a Fleet Captain as demonstrated in ""The TOS Episodes: The Menagerie Parts 1 & 2"" and was injured in a training accident never rising above the rank of Fleet Captain. On top of that they did not keep up with the Star Trek Universe in how Kirk got his Commission as Captain.<br/><br/>I could continue but I think you get the idea.

JJ Abrabs is a talented filmmaker and it is easy to see his enthusiasm (he is almost like a fanboy giddily recreating all his favorite childhood movies) and rigor but the reboot and especially the cast will always suffer from comparison with the original TV series. Furthermore, although the film is interesting and gets everything sorted- in as much as one can in less than 2 hours- there is a rushed feeling to the proceedings. The special effects are good but we've seen it all by now, the razzle and dazzle only goes so far. The Star trek reboot isn't a bad film as much as an unneeded one."

","I'm not a trekkie by any means. I have only seen two Star Trek movies in my life. When I was young, I watched the one where they go to San Francisco (back in time) to save the whales. I watched this a few times. I also watched Star Trek First Contact a few times. I liked both of those movies because the struggles of the characters felt authentic. It felt like space combined with the dramas we face in real life, but put into a science fiction, almost super natural light.<br/><br/>This Star Trek merely wants you to go weeeee, uppppp, downnnnn. It's like a ride. Don't we have enough of this? Honestly, are people really impressed by twenty minute action/explosion scenes? <br/><br/>There were some tense and good moments, especially with Spock, but overall, really not that interesting, and I'm sorry to say I don't have very high hopes for Star Wars because J.J.

Nice soundtrack as well, nothing like a classical masterpiece, but effective, especially in the concluding generic where it superposes the new and old themes in counterpoint.<br/><br/>Overall I don't understand old fans having a grudge against this more action oriented movie, that's what a star trek movie should be; leave the holodeck pool parties for the series.

","Yes so some crazed Romulan who doesn't actually look like a Romulan gets thrown back in time and causes James T. Kirk's father to die prematurely, thus altering the course of history. The reason this happens, is that Spock was too late to stop a star from going supernova. Quite why he was late is not explained, probably because the writer had no clue why a Vulcan would be late for a major event like a supernova... Well Spock has this 'red matter' which can cause a black hole which eats a supernova for breakfast. Presumably the writer knows nothing about astrophysics since his black hole can eat a star yet would not pull the orbiting planet out of the Goldilocks zone... not that there would be a Goldilocks zone since there's no star to support life any longer... It is this 'black hole' through which older Spock travels back in time... however, the supernova which was swallowed some moments before did not travel back in time to the same location, yet the now deranged Romulan is transported to the same spot some moments before Spock.... amazing how a whole cataclysmic stellar event just disappears down the plot-hole, i mean black hole... So Nero the crazy Romulan hangs about for a couple of decades for Spock to pop out of the black hole... then captures Spock and takes the red matter. Instead of going to save his own planet, fruit-loop Romulan decides to destroy Vulcan with the red matter... It's a pity the talents of the cast were wasted on such an awful script..."

","Fade-in<br/><br/>The movie begins with the story of how the earlier USS Enterprise is destroyed by the Romulun villain Nero(Eric Bana) and Captain (Faran Tahir) is murdered. This also shows how young Jim Kirk is born and his dad perishes along with the ship to save others. This is followed by the young Spock(Zachary Quinto) who has human and Vulcan blood getting accepted in the Academy of science but refusing it to join the Star Fleet. Later Jim Kirk(Chris Pine) is caught by Captain Pike(Bruce Greenwood) brawling with some bullies and rescued and advised to join the Star Fleet. Refusing to do so that time Kirk later goes to the shuttle for new recruits and challenges to finish it in 3 years. Here is where he meets Dr.Bones(Karl Urban) and makes friend with him.<br/><br/>An interesting scene is when we find out that Kirk breaks the record and passes the test designed by Spock which is basically impassable. The later scenes are pretty quick and a little unrealizable as new future age policies are thrown around and somehow Bones manages to get Kirk into USS Enterprise. Kirk realizes that the rescue mission that they are bound for is going to turn out to be a fight and warns Captain Pike. Spock is unrelentingly against Kirk's idea and puts logic into everything. He later agrees and the ship moves into Warp speed and reaches the Vulcan planet.<br/><br/>They face the Romulun ship and their transponders are deactivated and Captain Pike is invited to a conversation with Nero. Though he is advised by others to avoid going into the enemy ship he has a plan and takes Kirk, Sulu and another crew member to bail onto the drilling stem and deactivate it. The plan goes into action and here we see a lot of hand-to-hand action and Kirk and Sulu manage to deactivate the drilling stem but Nero manages to put the Red Matter into Vulcan which is about to create a black hole. Spock realizing his home is being destroyed beams onto his home and tries to rescue the leaders including his Parents. While beaming out he loses his Mother(Winona Ryder) and is devastated.<br/><br/>With Captain Pike captured by Nero, Spock becomes the Captain and there is an argument between Spock and Kirk about whether to regroup with the other ships or chase the Romulun ship heading towards Earth. Kirk is taken away and bailed out onto an ice planet Delta Vega. He regains consciousness and treks to a nearby control center. Here is the best part of the movie when he is chased by local savage creatures and ends up being rescued by Spock Prime.<br/><br/>This part of the story is the twist and we come to know that Spock in the future fails to save the Romulun planet from a supernova by creating a black hole using the Red Matter and Nero is angered by this and sends him here to witness his revenge against the Federation. Spock prime takes Kirk to the nearby control center to meet Montogomery (Simon Pegg) who created the transporter. They beam themselves into USS Enterprise leaving behind Spock prime. Kirk then manages to emotionalize Spock and makes him resign as Captain. Kirk becomes the Captain and they set course to follow Nero. They catch up with him and the final fight happens with Spock and Kirk beaming into Nero's ship and Spock hijacking the ship with the Red Matter and Kirk rescuing Captain Pike. Spock puts the ship with Red Matter into collision course with Nero's ship and at the right moment the three are beamed into USS Enterprise. They offer to save Nero but he refuses and the black hole is created but only to find that USS Enterprise is also being sucked in. At the last moment Montomery creates a blast and they escape.<br/><br/>At the end we find Kirk being honored and relieving Captain Pike as captain of USS Enterprise. Spock meets Spock Prime. Spock prime advises him to sometimes leave logic alone and do what he feels. Spock offers as the Officer First in Command to Kirk and their friendship is formed.<br/><br/>Fade-out<br/><br/>The best movie of 2009 till now. It has the necessary ingredients of Comedy, Action, Romance and Special effects to make it a blockbuster. Actors like Anton Yelchin (Chekov), Simon Pegg (Montomery), John Cho (Sulu) provide good entertainement. Chris Pine's cool portrayal of Kirk is definitely a breather. As all Science Fiction it had the disadvantage of impressing the crowd but it was a surprise when the audience started clapping at the end of the movie. A real crowd pleaser and definite revival of Star Trek craze"

","I'd like to start off this review by saying I am not a fan of the Star Trek franchise and never have been. I have seen random episodes of several of the many series carrying the title, but was never really grasped by any of the series. Other than knowing the names of the iconic crew members such as Captain Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Uhura etc. I do not posses much knowledge of the history of Star Trek. Having said that, I went into this movie with little to no expectations, which may explain why I could find few faults with this movie. I enjoyed the plot and although the transition of Kirk from simple cadet to captain felt a little rushed, it did not hurt the storyline in my opinion. <br/><br/>I can imagine that fans of the Star Trek franchise might have more trouble with this movie due to possible inaccuracies when compared to ""actual"" history from the series. However as I stated I am not one of these fans, and judging by the scores the movie received in several reviews I read, I will take the liberty to assume that both hardcore fans and newcomers enjoyed this movie for what it was as I did.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi movie every now and then, not only to Star Trek fans and I believe it has what it takes to draw younger generations to the Star Trek franchise, and consider it a worthy reboot.<br/><br/>7/10 - Good for what it is, not looking at possible inaccuracies when compared to the original series."

","I have never in my life watched Star Trek...until now. I heard from a friend who was in living the same Trek-less life I was that the movie was great. So I went to my local video store and grabbed Star Trek on blu-ray due to the lack of anything else catching my attention. I figured I'd give it a go, but never expected to like it.<br/><br/>But to my surprise, I loved it! I am the farthest thing from a Trekkie, believe me, but there were a few pop culture references even the biggest Star Trek virgin picked up on! From beginning to end I was completely entertained. The story, characters, and graphics of the film made me feel as if I was on the USS Enterprise with all of the cadets. I was completely engrossed, I simply couldn't take my eyes off of my TV.<br/><br/>Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were phenomenal. Their dynamic, I feel is what kept me so interested. I don't know what their dynamic was on the television show or movies before this, but if it's always been this entertaining, I may start getting into Trek...hey, better late then never! This film had a perfect balance of comedy, drama, suspense, thrills, and so on and so forth. What an amazing cinematic experience! I recommend this film to any and everyone who enjoys an all around good movie! It had everything in it without feeling too overdone or crowded. I rarely purchase films unless I know it is worth it and has rewatchability, but I do believe I will be making a trip to my local Walmart and buying the Blu-Ray this evening...<br/><br/>....See you don't have to know or like anything about the original Star Trek to thoroughly enjoy this movie!

"john_seater","2","4","7","21 August 2009"," Some good acting, tiny bit of good writing, idiotic & infuriating plot
","Overall, the film is a disgrace. On its own terms it is routine and dull. As a part of the Star Trek series, it is an awful travesty. In fact, it is not a Star Trek movie. It is a pirate job that uses the Star Trek name and the Star Trek characters and then goes off on a plot that is inconsistent with the plots of the TV shows and older movies that it stole from. On top of that, the plot stinks.<br/><br/>The plot is totally routine and predictable. Some crazy Romulan is mad at Spock for having failed, despite Herculean effort, to save Romulus from some implausible disaster. So the nut decides to travel back through time to get even with everybody, even people who had nothing to do with the disaster. Besides being simply stupid and hackneyed, this time travel aspect lets the writers depart from the Star Trek narrative, established through several TV series and several movies, both original and Next Generation. And depart they do, whenever they feel like it. The movie takes place when Kirk is a cadet at Starfleet Academy, so it happens before anything in the TV series or previous movies. But the unimaginative writers couldn't be bothered to work out a plot consistent with the all the rest of the Star Trek collection. Instead, they had to jazz things up by having Vulcan destroyed and Spock's mother killed, thus rendering impossible several episodes in the TV series and the old movies. The writers excuse this travesty by saying that the time thread was disrupted by the nutty Romulans' time travel. Well, isn't that cute? With that logic, they can do just about anything and claim they have produced a Star Trek movie. In fact, that is just what they have done. What they have created is a movie that steals the name and glory of the old shows and then does something not just unrelated but downright contradictory with its forebears.<br/><br/>There is some good stuff in the show. The young Spock is very good, very well portrayed by Zachary Quinto. He is the one character in the movie that has real character development. We also get a plausible explanation of McCoy's background, also portrayed by a competent actor, Karl Urban. The rest of the cast is pretty much a blow off. Worst of all, I think, is young Kirk. Yeah, Kirk is supposed to be cocky, but this guy is just a pain in the ass. Chris Pine grossly overplays the cocky part so that he ends up looking like weak slapstick. That may well not be Pine's fault. The director and the writers surely bear at least part and maybe all the blame. The other characters are shallow and not worth the time to discuss.<br/><br/>The plot is idiotic. I already explained the hackneyed time travel part. There are quite a few other stupidities, such as the following. There is the miraculous ""red matter,"" one drop of which is capable of imploding an entire planet, yet somehow a large glob of it can be carried around in a very small force field in a star ship and then extracted one drop at a time with a hypodermic needle without damaging the ship or even the needle. Come on. The famous episode of Kirk cheating to beat the combat simulation in the Academy is overwritten and overacted so that it is neither plausible nor amusing, just silly. Worst of all, though, is the end of the movie. Remember, Kirk and all these guys are just young'uns at the Academy, not even graduated yet. By a totally stupid plot twist, they end up commanding the flagship of the fleet, the Enterprise, in the battle with the Romulans, even though they're still cadets, not even midshipmen. OK, let's let that pass. Of course, they are so brilliant that they take out the Romulan ship from the future by great derring-do. Idiotic, but we let that pass, too. Then when they get back to Starfleet, guess what? The whole team (except the young Spock, but hold on) is given permanent command of the Enterprise. No, we won't let that pass. I mean, GET REAL!! A bunch of kids commanding the fleet flagship? Yeah, right. Oh, I said Spock wasn't included. That's because at the very end, Spock waltzes on board and informs Kirk that he has noticed that Kirk has not yet chosen a First Officer (yeah, right, a bunch of kids are about to take the fleet flagship out into space without a First Officer), so he asks permission to fill the post. The brat Kirk nods OK, and that's it. Spock gets the job. No need to get approval from Starfleet or anything. The whippersnapper crew goes off merrily into the future, presumably remaining together for at least 20 years on the same ship - as if that ever would happen.<br/><br/>This is the kind of light stuff an unimaginative hack writes for 5-year-olds. As a pretender to be the prequel to all the rest of the Star Trek productions, it is trash, nothing but trash."

","I know people have said that they didn't want a retread but what's wrong with sticking with what works? This movie is so desperate to modernize the legend that it loses its soul along the way. Is putting a slick, 21st century character spin on these characters worth putting up with what's lost in the translation? The movie is slick and hyper but it's not very good. Are a few good explosions worth wasting 120 minutes of time? For me, the answer is a resounding ""No!"" There are far better ways to spend your movie money than this too slick for its own good movie represented by JJ Abrams's latest endeavor. Putting aside the hamfisted plot (which is unevenly awful), all that's left is a woefully underwritten motion picture that starts off interesting enough but is smothered under each hyper and slick scene until all you have is a film that gets smothered under its own attempt at being slick."

","This long awaited and anticipated movie is absolutely terrific fun whether you are a Star Trek fan or not. Rarely have I seen a two hour movie that packs so much in and sprints along at such a frenetic pace.<br/><br/>All the new cast were superb (with the possible exception of Simon Pegg who may have misjudged his performance but who we see very little of). Pine and Quinto playing Kirk and Spock totally nail it - really believable while bringing new aspects and their own interpretations to the characters. Carl Urban who plays Bones McCoy is truly superb too as is Zoe Saldana as Uhuru.<br/><br/>This is really a character driven movie, and the Romulan bad guys are secondary to that - the real pleasure is in seeing the new crew get to know each other, interact and master the brand new ""original"" Enterprise. (The love affair interest is cleverly and deftly handled too).<br/><br/>The effects are phenomenal, and because this is a relatively unknown cast who aren't swallowing up 50% of the budget on their wages, all the money is up there on screen.<br/><br/>It isn't perfect, but it is hard to see how this could have been done much better. JJ Abrahams has accomplished the near impossible - a new invigorated Star Trek that has universal appeal.<br/><br/>If you have illogical prejudices against Star Trek or Sci-Fi and don't see this you are really missing out.<br/><br/>This is how to reboot a franchise - this is just way better than the Star Wars prequels.

"DICK STEEL","10","14","37","29 April 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Star Trek
","My adventures with the original William Shatner-led Enterprise crew had been confined to the cinematic movies of Star Trek, plus sporadic episodes from the original television series. I grew up more with Patrick Stewart's Captain Jean-Luc Picard commanding the Next Generation on board the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D in exploring strange new worlds and civilizations, as well as every movie made following that crew. It's quite unfortunate that Nemesis didn't fare too well at the box office, and hence it took this long (some 7 years!) before another Star Trek movie got made.<br/><br/>In between we had other spin off series like Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise, all which somehow didn't appeal to me, and their ability to cross over to the cinematic screen was, I guess, questionable. Then the question of how and where does one even begin in making another mass appeal movie, which by now has a whole wealth of content, and canonical ones at that. Imagine an established franchise with fans worldwide, some practically religious followers, and convince them that what you're making, and a reboot at that (horrors!) would be the right way forward?<br/><br/>But I got to take my hands off to J.J. Abrams, and especially to the scribes of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman for really having the balls, and the smarts, to do what they did. It's a reboot all right, but a really clever way to jump-start a legacy without making a mockery of its rich history, providing an acceptable (though not never seen before) method relying on stuff that science fiction is made up of. Of course I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to find out yourself, suffice to say that it made everything fall in place, with the involvement of Leonard Nimoy, and the background of the Romulan villain played to stereotypical perfection by Eric Bana.<br/><br/>At its core, with this reboot, it allowed for the film to establish the paralleled and troubled background of the ship's Captain and First Officer, James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) and Vulcan Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto), and with all solid partnerships and friendships, they too don't begin seeing eye to eye. It's a little bit curious though that this version of Star Trek has forgone its television roots for the cinematic debut first, and even though both Pine and Quinto came from TV, I don't expect to see this particular film spin off a television franchise of its own (though I'm secretly hoping so!). If anything, there should be an ongoing series (if box office receipts permit) for the cinema instead of the gogglebox.<br/><br/>It takes a while to showcase these individual characters at the top of the Enterprise command, before we get to see the rest of the familiar crew, now replaced with fresh faces, like John Cho as Sulu, Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, Anton Yelchin as Mr Chekov, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and Simon Pegg as Scotty, whom fans will have to wait until the mid way point to see his very limited, though memorable appearance on the deck of the ship. Since it's an ""origin"" film of sorts, we get more acquainted to Spock, who now demonstrates more emotions rather than cold logic from the Nimoy era, and Kirk still rolling with the punches as the action-hero man, still defiant and often unorthodox in his approach to the mission at hand. Fans itching to see what James T. Kirk is famous for, you'll finally get to see that in his Starfleet Academy days here.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film was as energetic as that of its younger cast, and what is a 126 minute movie did feel as if it's under 90 minutes, where it begins with a bang from the get go, and never decelerates from its warp speed. Abrams kept the pace very fluid, balancing emotional scenes with the more action-packed ones, though I feel there would be some passing pre- mature judgement that Star Trek is never about the action. That's true here as well (except probably when you're faced with Kirk hanging on a ledge of some sorts no less than 3 times), in case you're wondering about the trailer's bells and whistles. The sound design was excellent as well, as you really get to experience that silence of space each time the vast void comes to fill up the entire screen.<br/><br/>Non-fans might find some reason to scoff at Star Trek being a bit stiff, but this version makes it all sexy again. There's a wonderful story that doesn't pander to the audience nor disrespect its rich history, perfectly fused moments of humour, adequate action, and that core story of how the Enterprise crew got together for its maiden mission, and primed for more when the end credits roll. And it's just nostalgic to see the good 'ol USS Enterprise NCC-1701 given a facelift by Industrial Light and Magic, and taking flight again!<br/><br/>Definitely highly recommended, for fans who will be smiling from ear to ear when spotting little gizmos and easter eggs from knowledge of hindsight, and non-fans alike, who would likely be converted and inspired to go dig through the video archives for the original missions."

"Joejoesan","9","16","44","15 April 2009"," This movie rocks! But...
","As a long time Original Series fan the JJ Abrams reboot sounded good to me. I thought it would be a good way to revive the franchise with new young actors in a familiar setting. And when I saw about 20 minutes of the new Star Trek movie a few months ago there was no doubt in my mind: this movie would freaking rock!<br/><br/>Having just seen the JJ Abrams movie I'm still very excited. Okay, it isn't the masterpiece I secretly expected, but boy, there is so much to enjoy in this one! The good points: great action (both in space as in the sky), Chris Pine (the new Kirk) does a great job, Eric Bana is a scary villain and all the important Enterprise characters get decent screen time. The movie begins with a bang and especially the first half (about the young days of Kirk) is great fun to watch. The story – in which the old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) accidentally changes history in order to give the new leading characters a new reality – is a smart move to satisfy both old and new fans. Although it's a pity that the writers sacrificed the planet of ******* to achieve that. A big shock for the fans! But what works best in this movie is the relationship between young Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto). In the beginning they don't like each other. Spock still has difficulty to get rid of his human side and Kirk struggles with the Starfleet chain of command. When Kirk discovers that it is Spock who designed the Starfleet Academy test that cannot be won – yes Trekkies, that's the legendary Kobayashi Maru – things really start to heat up. To watch the two get closer to each other is great to watch. <br/><br/>While Chris Pine (Kirk), Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Karl Urban (McCoy), Anton Yelchin (Chekov) and John Cho (Sulu) are all doing great jobs, I had difficulty with two characters. First of all Spock. Zachary Quinto seemed to hesitate between imitating Leonard Nimoy and creating his own Spock character. Somehow it took a long time for me to get used to the new Spock. But maybe that was because the original one, Nimoy, was also in this picture. The second character that in my opinion still has to grow was – sadly to say – Simon Pegg as Scotty. In the trailer he was great. But in the final movie his funny moments seemed mistimed and misplaced. His humour misfired. What a pity. <br/><br/>What I didn't like in this movie – apart from the new Scotty? The camera-work sometimes resembled the one in Cloverfield too much. At times it was too documentary-like, with lots of flares and strange unnecessary camera angles. At the end of the movie the story may become a bit confusing for viewers who are not used to vintage science fiction, when the results of time travel become clear. Because you don't know exactly what Spock and Kirk are doing, the finale therefore disappoints a little bit.<br/><br/>Overall I think JJ Abrams Star Trek is a great movie and a fantastic way to reboot the franchise and - hopefully - produce more Star Trek movies. It almost never has a dull moment and has a lot of references to The Wrath of Kahn. I can't wait to take my 11 year old to see it. As a fan there was only one thing that really really startled me. It involved the relationship between new Spock and well, see for yourselves. It emphasized the fact that Spock was still struggling with his human side, I can see that. But I justdidn'tbuyit. But maybe that's just my nerdy side talking.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","It's the year 2009 and Star Trek has gone Hollywood and in order to booster it's 'mAiNsTrEaM aPpEaL', the movie takes on the famous JJ Abrahms to deliver a neatly packaged, glossy production with lots of director trademarked lensflare to remind us that its THE FUTURE. Sadly, much like a porno movie, the production doesn't change the fact there's a lot of sucking happening.
The original Star Trek characters are back! And this time they're...young? And Uhura is dating Spock? And Kirk's a wannabe Starlord character? Also it's an origin story (because if there's one thing Hollywood loves to do - its origin stories).
The plot is bland, played out, and by the numbers. The situations they get into could be swapped out with any current sci fi action movie and it wouldn't make a difference. A number of star trek references are made to remind you why you decided to pay movie to see this. Leonard Nimoy shows up because...he does. Don't think about it too much.
This movie plays it safe. Its original star trek sparkle is gone. Even has a sci fi movie its easily forgettable. But that won't stop Hollywood from milking this reboot until they've they're defecating on Gene Rodenberry's grave."

This new telling of the Star Trek story out does every previous telling without taking away from the countless hours of Star Trek entertainment already available in film and TV. I loved the acting. I loved the casting. I was drawn into the story from the very beginning and then stayed completely engaged to the very last frame. Sometimes I go to the theaters just hoping to escape from the world and its cares for a couple of hours and just enjoy pure entertainment. Star Trek gave me this experience. Don't miss this one! One of the best few films of 2009 along with Avatar and the Hurt Locker (really a 2008 film, but that is another issue)."

","After I saw the teaser trailer for this on the Iron Man DVD, I decided to check it out. And it was awesome, Even though I really haven't watched most of the Star Trek TV series or the films, but I say this is a great reboot to the Star Trek films. <br/><br/>The film stars Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood, Simon Pegg, Leonard Nimoy, etc.<br/><br/>I go over the story.<br/><br/>When the Romulan mining ship Narada attacks the Federation starship US Kelvin, Captain George Kirk substitutes his captain, who is going to meet the Romulan Captain Nero (Eric Bana) in his vessel to negotiate a cease fire, in the command of the US Kelvin. He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife that is in labor; while she delivers their son James Tiberus Kirk in the hospital shuttle-craft, George Kirk crashes the US Kelvin against the Narada. The reckless and troublemaker Kirk (Chris Pine) grows up and when he meets Capt. Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) in a bar fight, he is invited to join the Starfleet. Meanwhile in Vulcan, the outcast Spock (Zachary Quinto) grows-up discriminated by his half-human condition. They meet each other in the Starfleet Academy, where Spock accuses Kirk of lack of ethics, cheating a test of command. The trial is suspended with the information that Vulcan is under attack and the Federation spaceships head to Vulcan, including the recently commissioned USS Enterprise. Kirk, who is a stowaway, foresees an alien attack and advises Captain Spike; however, the Enterprise is damaged and when Captain Spike travels to meet Captain Nero, Spock assumes the bridge and has a serious friction with Kirk after the destruction of Vulcan. Kirk is accused of mutiny and stranded in the desert planet Delta Vega. Out of the blue, he is saved from an attack of an alien animal by an old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that explains to him that Captain Nero blames him and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet Romulus by a supernova. Spock explains that he had failed with the creation of a black hole with red matter to consume the supernova and Nero is seeking revenge. Now Kirk has to find a way to save Earth, the next destination of Narada.<br/><br/>So far this is one of the top action movies of 2009, along with Transformers 2, District 9, 2012, Avatar and Sherlock Holmes. <br/><br/>Star Trek gets 10 stars."
"PhotoGene47","5","5","10","4 December 2009"," Disappointing
","I found the characters to be undeveloped and superficial with little thought given to development of character in the Roddenberry tradition. It seems Paramount thinks that by changing the storyline of the original, they are free to change the whole course of Star Trek. I found the persons playing the roles of Kirk and Spock to be one dimensional and lacking the quality and spirit of the original characters. I found the use of language by Scotty's character to be another obstacle. I hope that future Star Trek movies will have writers more in tune with Star Trek philosophy than with their own self-centered interests."
"brando647","9","5","10","24 November 2009"," A Brilliant Re-Invention of a Long-Loved Franchise
","It has been a long time since I've been so blown away by the Star Trek franchise, with most of it's films in the past 20 years being underwhelming (with the exception of FIRST CONTACT). I was a fan when I was a kid but the later series and films caused my interest to wane of the years. So, when news was released the there was not just another movie in the works, but a reboot, I wasn't entirely thrilled. The inclusion of J.J. Abrams as director grabbed my attention but I was waiting to reserve judgment until it was released. For a STAR TREK reboot movie to truly succeed, the casting would have to be spot-on and it would need to excel where the recent films had failed: plot. After having seen the film in theaters (and multiple times since on DVD), I was blown away at how epic the final product was. STAR TREK was back, and thanks to Abrams, it was better than ever.<br/><br/>The plot is probably the weakest element of the film but it was still done well enough that any minor plot grievances on my part were instantly forgiven. The film brings us back to the very beginning, as the familiar crew of the USS Enterprise are completing their run in Starfleet Academy and are first assigned aboard the ship under the command of Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). On it's initial mission, the Enterprise crew encounter a disgruntled Romulan from the future intent on destroying the Federation, one planet at a time, in an attempt to avenge the death of his family and the destruction of his homeworld. In general, it's no so bad but the inclusion of the mysterious, unexplained ""red matter"" and use of black holes for time travel felt cliché and didn't fit into the established epic scope of the film.<br/><br/>The special effects in the film were amazing! I loved the sleeker, more graceful redesign of the Enterprise and all of the space battle sequences were some of the best since the original STAR WARS trilogy. Granted, Abrams use of lens flares may detract from the style of the movie but the production design was easily one of the most impressive aspects of the film. Everything...the bridge of the Enterprise, the planet Vulcan, everything down to the smallest shuttlecraft...was beautiful.<br/><br/>Finally, the most important question in my mind prior to watching the movie: how were the performances of those brought in to replace the original actors for these legendary characters? I was worried the younger cast was going to give the film a WB melodrama vibe but it couldn't be farther from the truth. Each of the cast seemed to embrace the spirit of those who came before them. Chris Pine as James Kirk came off as a bit too abrasive at first, but there were moments where you could see some inspired Shatner in his performance (particularly the Kobyashi Maru simulation scene). One performance I loved that I wish had been given more screen time was that of Simon Pegg as Scotty, who unfortunately doesn't make an appearance until the second hour of the film. The biggest surprise in the film (as I never saw it coming) was Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. Leonard McCoy. Seriously, Urban captured every mannerism and speech inflection of DeForest Kelley and did his great justice in his performance.<br/><br/>Going in with low expectations to this film, I was happy to find it actually ranks as one of my favorite movies in 2009. Abrams has reinvented STAR TREK and made it cool; of all the films in the franchise, this film is the most accessible to non-fans of the series and it can be enjoyed by just about anyone. It's a blast to watch and it's reinvigorated my interest in the franchise after years of disinterest. Enjoy..."
"pbungert","3","5","10","22 November 2009"," Not the Star Trek fans have known for years
","This movie gets it only one third right. Star Trek has always been about 3 things...the relationships between the main characters; a hopeful, noble vision of a future based on ideals; and imaginative, though science-based technology .<br/><br/>Well, the characters are here, although some, like Bones, are portrayed much more faithfully than others. In my opinion, this Kirk goes beyond 'cocky' to just being a jerk.<br/><br/>The hopeful, noble vision thing is *completely* gone, replaced with typical action-movie garbage. In the Star Trek I know, planets are ultimately saved, though main characters may have to make personal sacrifices. In this movie, a planet central to the whole Star Trek saga is destroyed with billions of lives gone but, hey, Kirk and Spock became friends, so everything is okay. It's Independence Day in space! And science...hmmm...just one question I'll ask here: I know it was originally a mining ship, but what's with the drill? Is it really necessary for the singularity to be created at a planet's core? Like being black hole adjacent wouldn't quite do it right? I suppose in this universe you have to swallow a nuclear device in order for it to be able to kill you."
"ganoe","3","5","10","22 November 2009"," completely forgettable
","Probably the only redeeming quality of this film was that most of the actors here would make for a good Trek cast ... given a decent script and plot. Unfortunately both are absent in this 2009 installment of Star Trek.<br/><br/>When they spoke of a ""reboot"" I was really expecting something more along the line of Battlestar Galactica. But where in BSG and even old-school Trek, you could feel for the characters and there was a long term vision, none of that is present here. Roddenberry's vision of the future was one of human optimism and exploring the frontier of space (BSG was more along the line of human optimism and exploring human origins). This film trashes character development, plausibility and reasonable science in exchange for the contrived, only to push out eye-candy special effects and flashy action scenes. It brings the characters together in implausible ways, promotes stowaway cadet Kirk to rank of Captain over an entire experienced starship crew, adds some time travel, black holes and lots of other weapons/explosions ... mix and repeat. It's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" goes to outer space. While I'm sure there is an audience for that kind of movie, it's a complete disservice both to Trek fans and anyone in general who wants to see a believable film.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where to go with this one. With a lot of effort, this film could probably be turned into a spoof of what is wrong with Star Trek, because it's a complete miss on all the good parts."
"thomas_mills","8","5","10","18 November 2009"," Missing a few points from a Perfect Movie
","Worth a watch, Star Trek fan or not. For those old time (original series) fans, this movie provided a few insights in character background, but missed the mark on a few occasions. Most important is realizing that because of the events in this movie, the series episodes might not have evolved the way they did. Spock even informs Kirk in the alternate time, he knew his father and how proud his father was of him. The two biggest issues I have are: First, Spock would NEVER let Uhura get intimate with him, I'm sure the writers played off his half human side, but because of being half human, he always strived to hide those emotions... always. Second, at the end when the future Spock was talking with the young Spock, knowing he had lost his Mother, he could have used his Vulcan mind meld to transfer all of his memories of his Mother to the young Spock, giving him something more valuable than any other knowledge... the writers missed this major ""heart string"" puller at the end of this exciting action movie that would have had everyone walking out with a tear in their eye (who doesn't love their Mother!)."
"restin_him","10","5","10","29 July 2009"," This is Star Trek People
","After years of telling people why I like Trek they can see a film that puts the original series into full light.<br/><br/>Star Trek follows the creation of the greatest crew to explore the far reaches of space. The opening scenes show us a dramatic and moving battle between the USS Kelvin and the time displaced ship Nerada. This battle introduces the villain Nero (Eric Bana) and shows us the birth of James Kirk. Jump ahead 25 years and we see Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) take two different paths to Starfleet and the adventure to stop the vengeance filled Nero begin.<br/><br/>Lets start with the amazing story. The script perfectly captured the characters, drama, terror, and passion of the franchise. One scene at the beginning of the film was so moving I had tears in my eyes. Just the beginning reveals the quality of what is in store for old Trek fans and the new ones to come.<br/><br/>Star Trek does an amazing job of capturing everything that makes Star Trek brilliant. Being a crazed fan since childhood I tell you this film communicated all the qualities that make Star Trek great. While us Trekies get our fill the film does not turn off new fans and in fact shows them the charm and beauty of this franchise (if I had a buck for every non-Trek fan friend who has asked to borrow my DVDs). Gone are the things that weighed down the last three Trek series (techno babble, the need for a deep understanding of TOS and TNG, etc.).<br/><br/>The actors were brilliant perfectly capturing each character. I seriously felt like I was meeting old friends after years of their absence. Chris Pine was smart in not trying to imitate Shatner but was still able to show some of Shatners Kirk mannerisms. Quinto had a tough job in the film considering that Nimoy was also in the film. Even with this mirror image Quinto played Spock perfect. Nero was a fantastic villain providing us with a great excuse for a restart.<br/><br/>The special effects are beyond description. The sheer beauty of it all was to much to take in on the first showing. Lucas needs to take lessons from these guys.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this film you must. Heck, it is probably hitting dollar theaters soon so no excuses."

","Pros: - Great CG and Visuals - Good Pace<br/><br/>Cons: - Few plot holes/random parts - Complete disregard for the source material<br/><br/>When I first watched this movie with my girlfriend... we both came out of the theater thinking we liked it. Now, I have learned to hate it and she still likes it. The reason being - I grew up watching TNG and the following series and she had never watched Star Trek ever. My issue is that the movie makes certain plot decisions that practically erase most of the entire Star Trek time-line... when in my opinion the movie could have been just as good without cleaning the Star Treck slate. This movie is basically the result of the creators making an original sci-fi adventure then cut and pasting Star Trek elements on top.<br/><br/>-AX"
"visa-5","5","14","38","11 May 2009"," A knock off! Well it's not so bad, they put a lot of effort in it, but still a knock off!
","Positive aspects of this movie are:<br/><br/>-it looks good<br/><br/>-actors are, mostly, good<br/><br/>-sounds fine<br/><br/>-it's leave your brain at home ( for real you need to leave your brain at home for this one ) kind of movie<br/><br/>-makes me giggle, or was that the audience laughing influence <br/><br/>-it's called star trek<br/><br/>The negative side:<br/><br/>-story ( what story, there is no story. There is? Didn't notice. No, wait! I did. The horror! Now I need to have my memories suppressed, again, or I am going to suffer from PTSD)<br/><br/>-plot ( hahaha, hm, hahahahahaha, what is that, is it something like a hole on the floor things get stuck in, oh no back to the first point and PTSD )<br/><br/>-storytelling ( but that is just for small children, and this movie is not for small children, so it is really not important or necessary at all? Nah, why bother with it.)<br/><br/>-it's called star trek? ( why God why? )<br/><br/>So mostly it is not such a bad movie. But it has actually nothing to do with star trek whatsoever except on the surface. Should have been called Cloverfield 2 because it has more in common with it than the real star trek. I personally hate these remakes that just remake the name and the look but not the core of the original. After the movie I felt like I bought something ( cellphone, wrist watch, etc. ) but instead the original i paid for and expected to get, got a knockoff, a crappy replica. Yes it will fool me for a moment but I still got cheated. And when they say this is star trek for the new generation what are they trying to say? Sounds like an insult to me. It's like they are saying this new generation is either to stupid to follow a good plot or just to lazy. Character development is not important because this new generation suffers from ADD so they won't remember the characters anyway as soon as the credits are on screen so why bother. Everything must be dumbed down or their brains will melt or something? Hm, sounds kinda insulting. Wonder if the new generation will realize what the corporate world takes them for. Anyway, I have nothing against transformers, cloverfield and mindless entertainment like that. But does it all have to be mindless?? I hope not because I can keep my mind on standby for a limited time otherwise I think I am going to go crazy and need some kind of psychotropic personality correcting pill like most of the so called civilized world population.<br/><br/>p.s. sorry for so much sarcasm, or am I?"
"MovieFanGuyy","9","19","55","14 April 2009"," The long, beloved Star Trek franchise is back with a huge bang!
","I was one of the lucky few people to catch an advanced screening of this franchise reboot of the original Star Trek series. As a long time fan who grew up with Gene Roddenbery's work, I have to say that in recent years, science fiction has gone downhill. In recent years, the aging Trek series has completely worn out even it's most defiant fans. After Roddenbery left the Star Trek stage, under the direction of Rick Berman, Trek went into a nowhere direction, with three average Next Generation films, (First Contact was good, but nowhere near as exciting as the best of the original series of films) Deep Sleep Nine was a constant bore, Voyager was little more than Lost In Space of the 1990s set in a Starfleet universe, and Enterprise went nowhere fast.<br/><br/>Star Trek was going completely in a tailspin until Lost creator J.J. Abrams, came aboard to jolt the aging Trek franchise with a much needed rush of adrenaline! Wow, this is easily the best Trek film in 20 years, bringing back the excitement of James T. Kirk, Spock, McCoy and all the original crew back to their full glory. It's like seeing old friends all over again (even though this is an alternate universe.) Yes, this is a reboot, but the film has much needed action, and a new storyline that will bring new fans of the decades old science fiction franchise. Well done guys, for the first time in many years, I'm ready to go on another Trek! This is easily one of the best films so far this year! I love The Next Generation show and characters which I grew up with, but, I'm sorry, their films cannot, I repeat cannot touch the magic of the original crew at all!<br/><br/>Best of all, you don't need to be a fan of the series to watch this film. It's designed for people who have never seen a single prior Trek film or television show to enjoy it. Take the family, it's great entertainment!<br/><br/>The academy recently expanded it's best picture category to ten films. Star Trek should be on that list!"
"briandarvell","5","6","13","4 January 2010"," Unfortunately, as expected
","This movie played and felt exactly like almost all other recent Hollywood blockbusters. The characters are the exact same ones you see in other films just with different names and the balance of action-packed and plot-lacked is just as similar.<br/><br/>Overall the story was awful and basically destroyed anything remotely connected with the Star Trek as most fans know it. The action meanwhile was very good and the movie came very fancy and fast-paced.<br/><br/>Spock was done the best. He was most like the Spock we all remember while the new Kirk seemed pushed too heavily on the arrogant-American side. Also, a structured main character who is the cool, hard life genius that knows-he's-better-than-anyone-else is such an overused creation these days that if this was any other movie I might have given up watching it. A lot of focus was also put on Uhura obviously because the movie ""needed"" some sexual element.<br/><br/>I wish these Star Trek movies and shows would finally end. If it wasn't a ""Star Trek"" movie than I might have called this just an average action movie but unfortunately it was supposed to be a ""Star Trek"" movie, somehow."
"sweettsera","1","6","13","7 December 2009"," What a disappointment
","This movie was such a disappointment, i can not believe it will continue to make it. This is the ""new generation movie"" were you take a older show and destroy it with new ideas. This falls more under Star Wars then Star Trek. Spock was a well played character in the past, but it seems that the directer wants him to be a emotional wimp and wants to force interracial relationships. Their is no true team in this show, it works more on a romance with Spock. I would not say not to watch it, but just be ready to see how America has continued to destroy the Classics of Hollywood and replace bad directing with a large budget. Sorry the original Star Trek had top acting and a low budget maybe that's why it was on the air so long."
"crsabers","10","6","13","23 November 2009"," Excellent Movie
","I just watched this movie for the first time, I wanted to see it in theaters but never got the chance. This move had a get storyline and I loved how they incorporated all the old members of star trek in it to make the movie seem like its telling the beginning of the TV show. Also liked the fact that Leonard Nimoy was able to be in this movie playing as Spock. I thought that was pretty cool to actually have the guy who played Spock the whole time come back and play his older self in this movie. Its too bad that William Shatner couldn't be in this movie and dear god i didn't know those two were both 78 thats incredible. Either way this movie was a def 10/10 and look forward to watching the movie again."
"Kevinator007","6","6","13","2 June 2009"," Would it make a difference if I say don't watch it?
","It is a decent sci-fi movie - not a very good star trek movie. It feels like an extended episode of the series, and you'd think - oh well - I'll wait for next week's episode which hopefully will be better than this week's uncommonly uninspired one. The hic however is that this is not an episode - it's supposed to be a blockbuster movie. The special effects - granted are up to standards for a movie which involved astronomical sums of money in its making.<br/><br/>The plot unfortunately resembles too much the usual ephemeral blockbuster in the box office which normally lasts a short burst up the charts and fades away very quickly. It is good fun but you tend to forget about the movie as soon as you leave the pictures. About the story itself ... why bother ... not much to say except that you've got people coming from the future trying to rectify things in the present. No wait! The way I've said it might make the plot sound interesting but don't be fooled. Watch the film only for the special effects and the chick in short red skirt.<br/><br/>Those who want to see an entertaining sci-fi movie - go for it. If you are a trekkie - you would probably still go watch it but now you know what to expect."
"Adorable","4","6","13","11 May 2009"," Leaves the frontier decidedly unexplored
","The Beastie Boys must be happy knowing their music will still be played in the 23rd century. Trek fans, maybe not so much. And it's not that there's anything outwardly wrong with having Sabotage play as a young, delinquent James T. Kirk rides around future Iowa in a 1960's muscle car, either. After all, this is fiction.<br/><br/>What's wrong is that the new Star Trek doesn't know what it wants. If it wants to be taken seriously as a bona fide science fiction effort, then there's no place in it for such dated slights of irrelevant pop culture. And if it wants to appeal to what must be the movie's main audience, i.e teens, then even by their standards the Beastie Boys are archaic.<br/><br/>These issues epitomize the latest Star Trek log entry's failure to truly reboot the franchise. It's a confused, long winded and ultimately unsatisfying picture with very little of the spirit that made the original series and its follow ups occasionally enchanting. Plus, with Lost now a joke of its former self, it's evident J.J Abrams' affections and attention were entirely on this movie – a misguided effort, if we may be allowed to say so.<br/><br/>In terms of talent, there's promise. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto interact well and manage to breathe some new life into their roles as Kirk and Spock, respectively. Zoe Saldana makes the most of her stint as Uhura, although for a release that billed itself as ""not your father's Star Trek"" her outfit sure seems a lot longer and less revealing than Nichelle Nichols' ever was. Another awkward aspect – the 2009 model appears to have taken on a prudence never recorded in the 1960's serial.<br/><br/>Eric Bana shines as Romulan captain Nero, but only gets a few minutes on screen, most consisting of orders to fire some weapon or other at a hapless Starfleet vessel. This problem hints at a broader plot that's made up of confusing time travel bits and overall disappointing action sequences. For example, Nero's massive ship appears above two of the Federation's prized planets, Vulcan and Earth, yet only the Enterprise shows up for the fight. Where's the rest of Starfleet? Where's the ground batteries? These are questions a science fiction lover would ask, which leads us to suspect this one wasn't done by sci fi addicts.<br/><br/>Please don't think we're knocking J.J – he's given us a lot of great stuff over the years, not least of which the amazing Cloverfield not so long ago. However, his imagining of Star Trek is a letdown. Even with OK performances by Simon Pegg (Scotty), John Cho (Sulu) and Karl Urban (McCoy), this remains a lacking addition to the pantheon. We're sure plenty thought the exclusion of the famous ""to boldly go"" intro and classic opening theme until the last three minutes of this behemoth was in poor taste. This isn't yet another sequel, we're talking a re-launch. They should have used more of the legacy, and we don't mean going back to the desert locale where Shatner fought that lizard. That's not enough, nor is working Slusho into the mix What it does get right it does due to having a bigger budget than everything prior in the franchise combined. The ships look better, San Francisco looks better, and Eric Bana's monstrous battleship rocks. There's even some interesting shots of the farmland Kirk hails from.<br/><br/>But even taken on its own this isn't a good movie. As part of a broader concept, it does little to improve on what's come before."

"Lady_Targaryen","9","8","19","21 May 2009"," This movie was much more than I expected!!
","The movie starts with a Romulan ship called '' Narada ''attacking the Federation starship USS Kelvin, where we see Captain George Kirk ordering an evacuation while he resists bravely to Narada's attacks, to cover his crew going away. In one of the ships, is George's pregnant wife, who gives birth to James T. Kirk. Many years later, we see a young,smart and rebellious Kirk wasting his life until he is invited by Captain Christopher Pike to join Starfleet. Pike knew James' father and gets very interested in James' potential. <br/><br/>While the years in the Academy passes, James becomes friends with Leonard McCoy, and also is accused of cheating on the Kobayashi Maru test by Commander Spock, a brilliant Vulcan responsible to create the test. ( A test that no one ever passed, by the way!) While in James' audience, the Starfleet receives a signal from Vulcan asking for Help, but James knows something is not right, and even being forbidden to travel in a mission, with the help of McCoy, he has success entering the Ship, where a lot of things and surprises are about to start.<br/><br/>I never really watched the ''Star Trek'' series (unless if you counts watching random scenes of the series while my father was watching) and I only know basic things about the characters, but even so, this movie was a big surprise to me. I didn't expect much of it, specially because I watched this film in the movie theaters only because the ''Angels & Demons'' sessions ended before I could buy my ticket, but you know what? I ended up having a lot of fun, and I liked even more then ''Angels & Demons'' itself.<br/><br/>The story is entertaining and mixes well comedy and action. The characters are charismatic, the new Spock is hot, and they choose actors who are very similar to the old ones. (It was cool to see the old Spock on this movie too, by the way!) A great thing about this movie is that they did it in a way, that a person who doesn't know well the Star Trek story and universe, could understand everything just fine. It's very funny to see the discussions and the competition between Kirk and Spock before they were friends too.<br/><br/>I don't know if the movie pleased the fans of the series, but I liked it a lot and I totally recommended it! I also believe that if the movie went so fast to the top 250, is because more people are enjoying then hating, so my opinion has a point. =)"

"anifanmc","10","7","16","15 May 2009"," The greatest Trek film of the new era, and one that is sure to live long and prosper
","I have rarely been able to go to the movie theater and say ""wow, that was a great film. It was completely worth paying 15 dollars to see it in IMAX"", since with a rough economy, I find it hard to justify taking out the time to watch films in the first place. Not only that, but many movies are essentially television episodes produced for the big screen, and don't take full advantage of the scope that a film can provide. Star Trek did that, and more, and topped it with icing and whipped cream while providing a relatively coherent narrative with an epic scope combined with special effects that truly blew me out of the water.<br/><br/>I had come to the film with high expectations, and was not disappointed. The strength of the film is apparent from the very beginning, when you witness the birth of Kirk and the death of his father thanks to direct meddling with the timeline by a crazed Romulan by the name of Nero, who's been thrown back in time inadvertently by a black hole. You later learn the black hole was created by collapsing a rampaging supernova that was consuming the galaxy, and before it could have been collapsed it destroyed Romulus, his home planet.<br/><br/>The film cuts to Spock and Kirk's childhoods, and their struggles growing up. Spock's Vulcan classmates refer to his mother as a ""human whore"" and he has trouble controlling his already massively turbulent emotions (which are because of his being half-Vulcan) due to his half-human nature. Despite being trained in the Vulcan art of emotional suppression, the Vulcan high council recognizes his abilities but always holds him on an inferior emotional level because of his dual species parentage, and he leaves them for Starfleet. Kirk, on the other hand, is being raised by his abusive stepfather, and despite being intelligent and intuitive, he's become a drunkard and a bruiser with no sense of direction to take in his life. That all changes when he meets Captain Pike, who tells him of his father's heroics, and he resolves to show his mettle by enlisting in Starfleet and earning his stripes as a starship captain.<br/><br/>In this sense, the film gives heavy precedence to the growth and story of Kirk and Spock, who embody the central presence in the film. They aren't friends at first sight, unlike the original series, and come to clashes when Kirk cheats on an infamous test (but if I told you what, I'd be giving too much fun things away!) that Spock designed. The interaction between the characters is far from awkward, and Quinto pulls off Spock's Vulcan stoicism with a passion. You can see his emotions beneath the surface, much like Nimoy, and he still possesses the casual sense of humor. This is perhaps the strongest part of the film, in that the cast members and everyone involved are not only good at their roles, but they bring to it a vitality that hasn't been seen in science fiction cinema for a long time. For all the insane criticism i've seen for them being young, that's *exactly* what we need - a younger, dynamic cast who can really bring energy to these roles. Even the minor roles, like Jennifer Morrison as Kirk's mother, were done so well I was convinced with their acting from the outset.<br/><br/>The space battles and SFX were, as I said, amazing, and it really gave dimension to the universe and to the scope of the Federation. My favorite scene is probably the orbital dive. The complete soundless space, no music, nothing except for the breathing in their masks, and then the boom of entering the atmosphere - this shows Star Trek at its best, able to use spectacle in an artistic form. The sound effects were cool and tuned to sound different, but at the same time quite faithful to the original (the beaming noise effect, the warp drives engaging, etc). I was particularly impressed with the soundtrack, which conveyed the urgency portrayed in the film and the fast paced action, while providing somber setpieces and a thematic tune for places like Vulcan.<br/><br/>I was most surprised by the vast emotional undercurrent in the film, particularly in choice scenes. The opening scene during Kirk's birth, where his mother is escaping in the shuttlecraft and his parents are trying to decide what to name him - all as his father, George Kirk, sets the Kelvin on a collision course and to his death - was one of the saddest, most poignant scenes in the entire film. I could actually see people crying in the theater. Another scene that stands out in my mind is where Spock meets his older self near the end of the film. The exchange shows the personal chemistry between Quinto and Nimoy, and it's quite believable that Quinto is playing the younger version of Nimoy's Spock.<br/><br/>I will warn the hardcore fans however that this movie does take considerable liberties with star trek canon. This didn't really bother me in the slightest, as it was (1) taking place in an alternate universe, and (2) has basically revived a dead franchise, but if you are easily bothered by things or take it too seriously, you're better off not watching the film. If you enjoy good cinema on the other hand, this is the movie to watch/rent when the time comes.<br/><br/>This movie is the must-see of the year, if anything else. It's made for the big screen, and you'll feel your money was well spent, at the very least. It's the beginning of a new adventure, and as I said, I hope this new franchise will live long and prosper."

","I'm almost 40 years old and I've seen most of Star Trek lots and lots of times, I grew up with reruns of the classic series and I watched Star Trek die with Star Trek: Nemesis, I thought.<br/><br/>When I saw the first teaser for the new film with the Enterprise being built, I had goose bumps. Now I've been to the cinema twice to see Star Trek and it's better than I thought. Much much better.<br/><br/>Some points have been criticised by fellow fans, even though they of all people should know better: <br/><br/><ul><li>non-canon alternate timeline. </li></ul><br/><br/>Come on,everybody watching Star Trek knows that it is full of alternate timelines and changes. From TOS to TNG, from ""The Voyage home"" to Voyager. Voyager has been saved by Ensign Kim 15 years after everybody died by sending a signal back in time to Seven of Nine...<br/><br/><ul><li>Spock wouldn't have changed the timeline like he did, when helping Kirk and talking to young Spock. </li></ul><br/><br/>He did not change the timeline, Nero did the moment he attacked the USS Kelvin. Spock tried to repair what was left, e.g. getting Kirk on the captain's seat and Spock to be his first officer, so they could become friends. This friendship and their work together was essential in the old timeline, so old Spock tried to get them back on track.<br/><br/><ul><li>Spock and Uhura. </li></ul><br/><br/>Even in the original timeline, Uhura tried to get close to Spock in TOS,so they could have known each other from Starfleet Acedemy. In the original timeline, Uhura arrived on the Enterprise when Kirk became Captain. Spock had been on the Enterprise quite some time by then, so Spock and Uhura have not been together anymore. In fact, in the alternate timeline, Uhura and Kirk are on the Enterprise 6 (!) years earlier than in the original timeline. In those six years, the ""orignal Spock"" could have managed to get rid of his emotions for Uhura.<br/><br/><ul><li>Crew is too young. </li></ul><br/><br/>See my point before. The crew of the alternate timeline is together six years before they were in the original timeline.<br/><br/>Those six years would have made all crew members more mature, but the events Nero caused brought them together much earlier. Which also means, there are six empty years to fill with new movies before anything from TOS could actually happen - if it still could, after all the changes in the timeline.<br/><br/>Star Trek is and always will be - entertainment and a vision. The new movie is both, it's first class 21st century entertainment and a different vision of Gene Roddenberry's idea. If you are a hardcore Trekker, you should remember IDIC ;) Now they can bring back Shatner as old Kirk in the alternate timeline. That should cheer some people up."
"tieman64","Null","7","16","11 May 2009"," TV, the final frontier
","Directed by JJ Abrams, and made by a cast and crew plucked from the world of prime time television, ""Star Trek"" (2009) attempts to inject some life back into a dying franchise. <br/><br/>Abrams' film recasts the characters from Gene Roddenberry's now iconic ""Star Trek"" series, erases the more cerebral, sociological aspects of ""Trek"", ditches everything remotely resembling science fiction and swathes itself in zany special effects. Murder, vengeance, death, genocide, violence and ego-maniacal ""rights of passage"" arcs are the film's raison d'etre, instantly making ""Star Trek"" the antithesis of Roddenberry's humanist, quasi-Utopian vision. <br/><br/>In truth, the ""Star Trek"" franchise has been degenerating for years, slowly becoming a crypto-Imperialist action series. But it nevertheless often tried to be weighty, and always had a certain recognisable aesthetic about it. A certain elegance. Abrams' ""Trek"", though, is pure mayhem; a zillion dollar car crash.<br/><br/>Still, the film works well as popcorn. ""Star Trek"" is fast paced, takes helpful cues from Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"", abounds with zippy dialogue, TV teen soap-drama, sitcom level humour and has some moments of poetry, like a sequence in which Captain James Kirk is born, his body exploding into existence amidst flame and vacuum. Unexpectedly, Abrams also manages to capture the feeling of brotherhood, family and camaraderie that made the original ""Trek"" so popular. But is it genuine or cosy familiarity?<br/><br/>On the downside, Abrams is weak with visuals. He relies on words, the rhythm of his scripts, rather than strong images. As a result, most of ""Star Trek's"" pleasures are derived from the patter of dialogue, the pace of its twists and turns, rather than anything we actually see on screen. This is not surprising. Spectacle is now largely dead. Successful blockbusters are moving away from image oriented screenplays to word oriented screenplays. Audiences are left dazzled by frenetic storytelling, constant plot beats, incessant vignettes, canned drama and fast dialogue, rather than extended set pieces, new ideas or effects.<br/><br/>Still, there are some neat visuals scattered about. Consider one in which distant shuttles trickle across the screen. Mostly, though, the Starship Enterprise is ineptly photographed, and Abrams' space battles are shot with a frenetic, urgent, pseudo documentary camera. It works at times, but also reeks of a kind of desperation. <br/><br/>The ""Star Trek"" franchise had a few cool sets in its past, but there aren't any in Abrams' film. His starship bridges look like Apple showrooms, and real life factories and chemical plants are used as stand-ins for engine rooms. Later, a villain's ship is simply a mass of cliffs, chains and dark rooms. <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the film is a raging rip-off of ""The Wrath of Khan"". Marooned characters, truth bugs, villains bent on vengeance, the Kobayashi Maru, a self-sacrifice scene, a reluctance to admit a fear of failure, planetary destruction, super-weapons (a planet destroying super-weapon that rips off both Trek's ""genesis device"" and ""Star Wars'"" Death Star), ships hiding in clouds etc etc...are all ideas borrowed from ""Khan"". It's all very cheap - particularly one sequence in which Abrams wipes out a planet for kicks - but because things are so fast paced, you're quickly beaten into submission.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the film exists in an ""alternate reality"" such that anything which happens in this new series does not undermine what has gone on in previous instalments. But why not jettison this idea completely and simply reboot the franchise? In attempting to placate fan-boys, Abram' screenplay gets increasingly ridiculous. <br/><br/>Other silly moments abound: wouldn't someone have spotted a giant star that was about to go supernova? Why do the black holes have to be at the centre of planets to be effective? Since when do black holes send you back in time? How can these holes destroy entire planets but not ships? Why throw Kirk in an escape pod rather than jailing him in the brig? Isn't it too much of a coincidence that Kirk lands on the very same planet where Spock is hiding and where Scotty has been working? How gimmicky is the concept of ""interplanetary beaming""? How can people respond so callously to the destruction of an entire planet? Why didn't the planet have orbital defences? Why promote Kirk to captain so swiftly? Why doesn't the villain – essentially a clichéd pantomime Bond villain – not age after 25 years? <br/><br/>8/10 – Science fiction is supposed to be a genre of ideas. Though fast and fun, Abrams' ""Trek"" points toward a depressing future for this new franchise. Things are going to get a lot dumber. Worth multiple viewings."
"subego","9","7","16","9 May 2009"," My worst fears were left unfounded...the movie is AWESOME!
","Wow...that is all I can muster...wow! Look, I am a die hard trekkie through and through. I am a fan of all the series' and mythology (except possibly ""Enterprise"") but still have to rate the original series as my top choice. I am also a purest with regards to Trek history and timelines...which is to say that I grow irritated when newer series' decide to do things like include the Borg even though, officially, they are introduced in the 2nd season of Next Generation, but somehow they end up in Enterprise, which is set 100 years before the ORIGINAL series. Those kinds of liberties are the things that can kill any good will that may have possibly been generated in me for series's like that. <br/><br/>That is why I initially held a certain amount of apprehension with regards to the movie. Of course I was going to see it regardless, but I retained a healthy dose of skepticism about how they were going to pull off the feat of having all the primary members of classic Trek meet on the Enterprise, as opposed to how conventional Trek history dictates their collective histories unfold separately. I was very satisfied with how this was resolved...it was cleverly conceived, plotted and written! It never seemed like a half-assed attempt to throw the disparate elements together in the hopes of having it somehow come together. <br/><br/>The characterizations were probably the greatest strengths of the movie. In particular, for me, Karl Urban as McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty were absolutely priceless and spot-on! Urban was especially believable as the younger, but still cantankerous ""Bones."" He not only bore a striking physical similarity to youthful DeForest Kelly, but his vocal mannerisms and facial expressions were so accurate as to be almost frightening!<br/><br/>OK, to sum up, new Star Trek movie = an unparalleled YAY! My worst fears...the ones of this being a lame, uninspired, tacky and confusing rip-off appear unfounded! This is a welcome edition to universe of Star Trek and I sincerely hope that we can enjoy this ensemble for many years to come!"

Like the way Star Trek the motion picture was good albeit tedious till the Wrath of Khan came along and took the franchise on a wild and wondrous ride; here's hoping that the sequel (which is already on the cards) will elevate the franchise without sacrificing much of what we fans love about the Trek back stories on our beloved characters. LOVED Leonard Nimoy's role, I am SO HAPPY to see him again as Spock.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams....please take note, don't mess with the characters too much. Remember why the rebooting of Batman worked SO WELL, the movie stayed true to the original back story and it gained the fans' support while winning new ones."

","Ever since the crew of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise signed off at the end of ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"", the film franchise had taken a nosedive. Besides ""First Contact"", all the subsequent films only served to facilitate the demise of the franchise, with ""Nemesis"" seemingly the final shovel-full of dirt into the coffin. With the ""Original Series"" cast gone, the franchise (at least in terms of box office and TV ratings, not fanboys like me who will watch it regardless of popularity!) slowly died away.<br/><br/>However, after young director J.J. Abrams began building a name for himself with such projects as ""Alias"", ""LOST"", and ""Cloverfield"", he decided to tackle the challenge of making Star Trek relevant again to today's audiences. Abrams accomplished that goal with flying colors!<br/><br/>Since the ""Original Series"" characters are still (some 40+ years removed from their show) the heart of the Star Trek franchise (people don't flock to conventions to see Scott Bakula!), Abrams resurrects them in this film by showing them in their early years of space exploration. This proves to be the biggest success of the film, as nods to TOS abound throughout the movie. Since those are the characters we care the most about, we hang on the edge of our seats to see a young Captain Kirk get a little feisty, a young Spock raise that eyebrow, or a young Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy utter his trademark grumbly phrases. <br/><br/>Along with the time-period (pre-TOS) choice, the casting is also spot-on. On can easily imagine Chris Pine growing into the Kirk popularized by William Shatner, while Zachary Quinto also portrays a very believable Spock. Perhaps the most fun character in the film to watch, though, is Karl Urban as the cantankerous (even at a young age!) Bones. The actors playing the characters of Uhura, Scotty, Chekhov, and Sulu also turn in performances that easily harken back to their TOS predecessors. An appearance from old hand Leonard Nimoy (which turns out to be a lot more than just a cameo!) also fits right in to the flow of the film, not seeming forced or desperate.<br/><br/>There is also a pace and energy to this movie that is relentless. Basically, all the beats happen perfectly, punctuated by a score that is perhaps the best I've ever heard in the cinema. One would think it would be more difficult to reboot what had become such a stodgy franchise, but JJ makes it look easy. I think the bottom line is that it made me remember why Star Trek stories can be so great.<br/><br/>Overall, then, this Star Trek is critical to the franchise because it put Star Trek on the map again. It has all the ""old stuff"", it has the energy of a contemporary flick, and the plot/characters are almost perfect. With the exception of ""Wrath of Khan"", this may be the best Trek movie of them all."

","Star Trek (2009): Dir: J.J. Abrams / Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Leonard Nimoy: The ultimate space adventure finds its roots as Captain James Kirk grows up fatherless and Spock's home planet is vanquished. The film places the two in conflict while Trek fans understand the bond that eventually grows. Directed by J.J. Abrams who understands the origins of the series and is backed with fantastic visual elements of spacecrafts and bizarre creatures and lifeforms. He previously directed Mission: Impossible 3, which is the best of that series. Here he creates one of the very best of the Star Trek series. Chris Pine plays Kirk, rebellious yet with great instincts. He eventually becomes Captain Kirk but not without taking chances. Zachary Quinto plays Spock who learns a thing or two about emotion as he conflicts with Kirk who in turn challenges him. This will result in a future friendship but not without a great cameo appearance that reveals it all. Karl Urban plays Bones, the doctor and friend of Kirk's who takes a chance on Kirk and turns out to be right. Simon Pegg brings comic relief as Scotty who is merely discovered and adapts to this new world. Leonard Nimoy makes a great cameo appearance playing Spock in the future who informs Kirk where their relationship will go. It celebrates a series by reclaiming its origins and starting over again.

","I was drawn in by the movie, liking Star Treck NG, VOY quite a lot, and then seeing this really high rating on the movie review sites. Not wanting to spoil myself, I didn't read any of the reviews and just watched the movie - what a wasted two hours these were!<br/><br/>The other low-rating reviews are completely right. ""Star Trek implored us to do good and explore"", someone writes, ""this movie seems more about promoting violence"". Check. At the end of the movie, Kirk crippled the Romulan ship:<br/><br/>Kirk: ""I offer you assistance."" Spock: ""What are you doing? This would be unwise."" Kirk: ""Sssh, I just offered that so maybe we score with the Romulan empire."" Nero: ""I would rather dieeeee than accept assistance!!!"" Kirk: ""Okay. Have at him. Fire all laserz."" Nero's Ship: BAMMMMM!<br/><br/>And it stays at that level of cheesy predictability. Like when Kirk just totally coincidentally stumbled upon Spock's older self, who, by the way, saved Kirk in the last second. Gosh, wasn't it a lucky shot that they were both abandoned on the same planet within walking distance? Anyway:<br/><br/>Old Spock: ""You have to take control as a captain of the Enterprise."" Kirk: ""How would I do that?!"" Old Spock: ""Tell my younger self that he is emotionally compromised. He will resign.""<br/><br/>Not even five minutes later:<br/><br/>Kirk: ""Spock, don't you feel anything? Your mother just died! But you probably never even loved her anyway."" Spock: ""RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR"" Spock: ""I resign because I am emotionally compromised."" (he literally has to spell out the exact reason again, in case the viewer forgot.) Kirk: ""I am now Captain."" Crew: ""Aye Captain.""<br/><br/>Oh yes, and Uhura has a sex interest in Spock. Who knew? There's a long drawn out scene in the turbolift for you to get the point. Ugh.<br/><br/>Horrible, horrible movie. Bad acting, plot holes that even as a non- hard core Trekkie will take you out of the movie more than once, making you rethink if what just happened even makes any sort of sense. It's like the entire movie has ADHD.<br/><br/>Before watching it, I considered gifting it to my mother (a Star Trek fan) for the holidays, since it has all the old characters in it, and shows what happened ""before"" everything started - but no way. This isn't even Star Trek, the entire movie is set in an alternative timeline starting from the get go, which then becomes the canon timeline. Yeah, right. What a waste."

The redesign of Applespace is bad enough, but directorial wise, Abrams falls back on old standards from everything previous that he's done. Lots of shots of people running to give a false feeling of excitement, check. Count downs and one dimensional villains, check. Bad technology advancement (when does this take place again?) check. Pop references and modern music being listened to in a bar check. Messed up time lines that have no real point? Check. Macguffin device that will be only used once in the film and never again? Check.

","I love the Star Trek franchise so much I want to see a new Star Trek series! A lot of fan hopes are riding on this film! To drive this point home - I actually stopped watching television programing completely once Enterprise (the last Star Trek series) went off the air about 7+ years ago! And, I have literally watched every TV episode (and film) of every Star Trek series, in real time, since its inception in 1966! I also collect rare vintage Star Trek memorabilia, have heard Leonard Nimoy, and many others involved with Star Trek, speak at various Science Fiction Conventions from the early 1970's to the present, and I subscribed to a Star Trek fanzine, ""Trexperts,"" edited by a one dedicated Star Trek fan, which is still mailed all over the world! Needless to say, the Star Trek universe has had a huge impact on my life! <br/><br/>I sincerely hope someone from Hollywood reads this review! In the long run (and that's what Star Trek is all about) you're not going to win new fans by dumbing-down Star Trek into a comic book story solely to satisfy the fickle teen market! I realize a lot of the previous 11 Star Trek movies have been box office flops (and for good reason!) because IT'S ABOUT THE STORY, STUPID! Sure the special-effects-eye-candy is spectacular, the cinematography does not disappoint and the design of the sets are absolutely amazing! The acting ranged from excellent (the New Captain Kirk & Leonard McCoy) to sufficient (the new and original Mr. Spock). And, all the supporting cast certainly held their own! But the story was so unimaginative and preposterous, it came across as nothing more than boring cardboard drivel.<br/><br/>It kind of boggles the mind! There are absolutely an endless number of Science Fiction themes that run through all the various Star Trek episodes. What more could you want? You have about 26 YEARS worth of episode ideas to choose from! Then there are plenty of ideas Star Trek has not explored which is summarized in a single 900+ pages book covering most Science Fiction ever written in any language in the world: ""Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction."" It doesn't take a genius to do the research to come up with new and wonderful ideas! But no! The Spineless Chickens at Paramount had to make a film with as much delight and imagination as the last Star Trek movie dud! What an incredible insult to all the Star Trek fans that have spent their time and money supporting Star Trek over the years by watching only God knows how many vapid TV commercials or spending their money on film tickets, videos, DVD sets, books & fan magazines, convention tickets and Star Trek memorabilia!<br/><br/>Ironically, at the same ""Star Trek"" was playing in the theaters, I went to see a brilliant science fiction animated film, Battle for Terra. It's hard to believe, but it was showing on a mere single screen in a metropolitan area with about 1.5 million people! Despite the magnificent animation, storyline, and acting - staring both Danny Glover and James Garner (of all people!), it was a miserable flop at the box office. Why? Because the story was both too imaginative and gutsy! Something the Star Trek franchise once was like - a long, long time ago! I can only pray that in the future Hollywood's goal of relentlessly maximizing profits does not win out over substance and delight!"

None of the actors are miscast at all, and seem a perfectly natural fit to those names that a lot of us have grown up with, particularly Simon Pegg as Scotty.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I guess trying to jump back to the normal time line beginning would not have been as interesting, and it would have also precluded them from having Leonard Nimoy play an older Spock.<br/><br/>This was a well thought out movie. Good script, believable characters, and great FX. A most interesting and welcome addition to the Star Trek family. I can only hope the sequels will be kept to the same high standard."

","Let me say up front I am not a die-hard Star Trek fan. I did grow up watching original series re-runs, the tapes of the movies, I've seen episodes from the spin-off shows and I've read some of the novels here and there so I've got a good working knowledge of the show. Having assumed that Star trek was dead after the lack-luster Nemesis and the cancellation of Enterprise (a show that remains underrated in my opinion) I was rather surprised over a year ago when the teaser trailer for this movie popped up before Cloverfield announcing that J.J. Abrams was bringing it back. Having raised my expectations since then I went to a screening last night with hopes for a good Star Trek movie. That in short was what I got and more.<br/><br/>To start off with there's the cast. It's never an easy task replacing a well known cast with a new group of actors especially when the cast in question is those of the original Star Trek series but not only has this film done it has done well. I was initially skeptical of Chris Pine as Kirk but Pine not only fills the rather large shoes left before him but fills them admirably and by the end of the movie you have no doubt that he is Captain James T Kirk. In truth that statement can really be applied to the entire cast of ""new"" old characters but in particular it can be said of Zachary Quinto as Spock and Simon Pegg as Scotty as both fill some rather large shoes very nicely indeed. There's also a nice (if underused) villain in the form of Eric Bana as Nero plus a fantastic supporting cast including the ever excellent Bruce Greenwood plus Ben Cross and a woefully underused Winona Ryder as Spock's parents. And then there's the return of Leonard Nimoy to the role that made him famous in some of the best and most unexpected scenes of the movie. In short it's one of the best Star Trek casts.<br/><br/>This has also got some really good production values. The set designs have echoes from the original series but give a nice modern feel to them and this is especially true of the bridge of the Enterprise itself. The film's CGI is (in two words I use very infrequently) awe-inspiring especially when it comes to the various ships sued in the film but especially of the Enterprise which looks like a perfect meshing of both the original TV series ship and the one used in the original series cast movies. In fact if one can find nothing else to say about this film it is that it has the best special effects in the history of Star Trek to date.<br/><br/>The film is an action film with a good story. From the opening teaser sequence right thru to the end the film is full of space battles, sword fights and fist fights. The fights are all well staged and put similar sequences in the two most recent Trek films to shame. The space battles, thanks to the excellent CGI mentioned above, also come across as the best yet done for Star Trek as whole. Yet while this might be an action film it hasn't lost what makes Star Trek so good to begin with: story. In what can be called increasingly rare in the Hollywood action movie the writers actually take the time to explore character development. In fact it is the journey of these two young men whose destines has always been intertwined that forms the emotional center of this movie. That really brings us to the Nimoy scenes and the sticky issue of continuity.<br/><br/>As I said I'm not a die-hard Trek fan so continuity doesn't really bother me in this case but I know it bothers some out there so let me say the following. While this film features the original group of characters from the original series they're different versions of them. This is thanks to one of the tried and true plot devices of Star Trek: time travel and interference with the past. That said the interference causes a lot of changes from the subtle to moments where I can see some going ""blasphemy on the alter of Roddenberry!"" In particular there's two plot points (one of them being a relationship) which might do that but for those of us who realize (as the movie itself says) that the past has been altered and this is a new time-line it shouldn't be anything too upsetting and if fact it makes for some fascinating viewing. The film is also full of nice little references to various Trek stories of the past especially the best of the Trek films The Wrath of Khan. The scenes with Nimoy (including the most impressive Vulcan mind meld I've ever seen) illustrate this point beautifully: this is the end of the beginning and the start of a whole new Trek.<br/><br/>Another aspect that brings the point of this being both an ending and a new beginning is the score by Michael Giacchino. Star Trek has always been known for some nice film score and this film is no exception to the rule. The score is bombastic when it needs to be and personal when it needs to be. Giacchino also makes very sparing use of the classic Star Trek theme itself until the end credits to let the audience know for certain that while things might have changed this is still Star Trek.<br/><br/>If this new Star Trek movie is any indication there's a life for this little TV series after all. With a fine cast, well designed sets, fantastic CGI work, well staged action, nice scripting and good music I can say one thing for certain. If this is the future of Star Trek then may this new Trek live long and prosper."

","This should be called something other than ""star trek."" Actual Star Trek is a little more than cognitive than dumb action based BS. The plot(s) fail in interest as well as resolution. The directors and writers need to have a LOT more story telling and better unfolding of the adventure. This was just one action situation after another without reason. How other reviewers thing better than a 2 star is beyond me. The fact is, the Star Trek audience expects more intelligent and cerebral stories."

Abrams has taken Roddenberry's dream and soiled it with this diarrhetic abomination! It is nothing more than the usual lame 21st century sci-fi flick with lots of glitzy special effects, no story, poor acting and lousy directing.

It does in the sense that there is chaos going on around them, and death is lurking while life is coming.

","I could barely stomach watching this - I am not a big Star Trek fan, but I was willing to give the movie a chance. The moment they pulled the red matter crap I about turned it off. Look, suspension of disbelief is all nice and good, but there are lines you just don't cross, not without turning it into fantasy or space opera (and it was neither). The ending was the worst of all - no sci-fi that has EVER taken itself seriously has ever pretended that faster-than-light (FTL) travel was actual, physical speed - it violates fundamental laws of physics. Would you take a sci-fi seriously if it said gravity stopped working, just because you said so? Or if it said people could magically breathe in space with no other explanation? I doubt it, and yet that's how badly this breaks it. Star Trek's always been hazy on warp, but it's never been so stupid as to pretend it was an actual normal speed that just happened to be FTL until now.<br/><br/>Worse, to solve the problem they jettison the core(s) (which is the very thing KEEPING you in warp in the first place), and use the explosion to go faster. Excuse me? You're already going faster than light. The energy emission from the core explosion cannot possibly be faster than you're already going.<br/><br/>You have to realize, to even watch any sci-fi you're automatically suspending disbelief. Suspending disbelief to extremes is fine in fantasy since you can technically explain everything as magic unless it contradicts something you explained earlier. You can't do that in sci- fi, the writers simply are incapable of thinking more creatively than ""faster makes you go faster"".<br/><br/>And of course, there's the whole issue with Nero's motivation making no sense at all, and that is a *character* issue."

","I was never too much into 'Star Trek', the famous 1960s sci-fi television series characterised, with hindsight, by its liberal optimism. These days, the name is a brand that has been applied to various additional series and countless movies, the latest of which purports to tell us the story of the early days of the original series' characters. And it starts charmlessly, with product placement interspersing an utterly generic story – while the actors chosen to play the roles look the parts, the tale of wannabe captain James T. Kirk could have come from any movie about a young hotshot in any context. There's a silly time-travel plot as well that I couldn't make much of. Things get a little better when Leonard Nimoy (who originally played Spock, the series' defining character) turns up in a cameo, and Simon Pegg, who plays Scotty the engineer, at least attacks the role with gusto. But if you're not a fan already, it's hard to imagine you'll find much to appeal to you in a film that does what you might have expected it too, but absolutely nothing more."
"tom-456","5","4","8","18 May 2009"," Don't bother with IMAX versions -- even the real IMAX
","All in all it was a decent Star Trek story, and acted reasonably well, but from standpoint of special effects and technical matters generally, it just doesn't measure up to the standard established by many other movies in recent decades. The quality of the directing and editing also leaves much to be desired, particularly the fights scenes, where it is apparent that instead of having the stunt professionals take over and/or teach the actors how to pretend fight, they just had them go through some slow motion choreography and then tried to simulate fighting by chopping up the sequences very badly. This is one of my particular pet peeves with certain movies and certain directors. If there is going to be a fight in a movie, it should look like a fight, and the technique of chopping up the film to the point that you can't really see anything at all just does not achieve any realistic effect. <br/><br/>I made the unfortunate decision to see this movie at a regular, full-size IMAX theater, and this was a disaster. It has been widely reported that many of the screens at regular theaters are nowadays being promoted as IMAX, but using screens that are not particularly large, and using digital projectors, actually DLP projectors, instead of the big projectors that real IMAX theaters use, which run 70mm film through, oriented sideways. If there is any point at all to these digital IMAX theaters, it is so that real IMAX movies can be shown in regular theaters. But when you start off with a film that was shot in 35mm Panavision anamorphic format using an aspect ratio of 2.35 : 1, it is difficult to find any point in presenting this on any sort of IMAX screen at all. Even if they stick with the same original 2.35:1 Panavision version shown in regular theaters, the only discernible advantage of converting the film to digital media and using a DLP projector, is that of reduced cost. But for the real IMAX theaters, the problems are more significant, starting with the need to transfer the movie from the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio to the IMAX aspect ratio, which, at 1.43:1, is only slighter wider than old-fashioned non-HD television (1.33:1). The problem is entirely the same as the familiar, long-standing problem of how you show Ben Hur on a regular old-fashioned TV set. They obviously would not get away with having black bars on the top and bottom of the screen (it would have been 40% of the total IMAX screen area), so they had to pan-and-scan. That's right, folks, the IMAX version that you paid an extra $5 to see on the giant IMAX screen is a pan-and-scan version. The 35mm negative film doesn't have nearly the resolution needed for this large a screen, so what you see is a large pan-and-scan version that is so blurry as to be distracting. On many of the close-up scenes where two of the actors were interacting, they were unable to get them both into the frame, and it was apparent that they were panning and scanning back and forth between the two actors, whereas the original undoubtedly had a stable camera view with both actors. This was very noticeable in several places, particularly toward the end when the two Spocks were conversing. When they panned to Leonard Nimoy they also zoomed in on his face, which makes sense given that you have decided to pan to him, but in addition to the loss of detail that happens when you try to blow a picture up too large, something else had to have been done incorrectly, because the image was blurry beyond what you would believe if you did not see it for yourself. I noticed this several times throughout the movie, and my guess is that whatever sort of camera they used to photograph the original movie (the process that they refer to as ""converting to IMAX format"") was not properly focused on the film whenever they panned away from the center of the frame.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the IMAX (real IMAX) pan-and-scan version of this movie is a technical abomination, and I encourage you not to encourage the jackasses who made the decision to do this, whoever they are, by rewarding those jerks with your money. Any movie that is shown on a regular IMAX screen ought to be filmed originally in an aspect ratio very close to the IMAX aspect ratio. Ideally, it should also be shot using regular 70mm cameras in the very least, but the issue of resolution is secondary to that of the aspect ratio. The Batman movie that was shown in the large IMAX theaters was shot specifically for the IMAX theaters using either IMAX cameras or some other camera suitable for IMAX screens, which is why on the DVD, it still has the IMAX aspect ratio. You can shoot a movie in a widescreen format, or you can shoot a movie in IMAX aspect ratio, but no way, no how can you shoot a movie in the widescreen format in which this movie was shot and then try to show it on an IMAX screen."

","The elements are so convoluted with the Star Wars universe in this latest installment, that I do not know where to start. We have Obi Wan (Pike) Luke SkyWalker (Jim Kirk), Darth Vader/Maul/Sidius (Nero), Leia (Uhura), Alderan (Vulcan), C3P0 (Young Spock) and Yoda (Old Spock) and the comparisons go on and on and on to the point of rip-off. Kirk (and Old Spock) are marooned on Hoth. I mean Seti-Alpha 5. I mean ANOTHER ice planet, not Hoth, but the brain biters from Seti-Alpha 5 are employed here, although not in the same way, and now they do different things, but they are the same ""indigenous life forms"" from SA5.<br/><br/>*sighs* I wanted to love this movie. I've waited anxiously for YEARS for this film, watching as the parts were cast, as the script was approved, as filming began and ended, and as the post production work was commenced. I have to say that as far as the cast is concerned, they were all cast beautifully. Unfortunately, the casting is the best element OF this film.<br/><br/>We have an alternative reality, which means that Anton Chekhov is present in Star Fleet and on the Enterprise from the beginning, which we all know was not the case. It also means that all of the other 45 years' worth of Franchise History may be overlooked, and was SO overlooked as to be done with great relish.<br/><br/>Also overlooked, is sound reason. The contrived element of ""Red Matter"" was devised to create a black hole event when it contacts with matter. As lame as that sounds, it looks very good on the screen. What does not look good, is the vastly overlooked fact that it is held in a plasticine container, extracted through mundane methods involving a SYRINGE, and then injected into another mundane container before deliverance is initiated, with no black hole occurring within the syringe, nor within the secondary container. Even that not withstanding, the whole plot line does not stand up to the test.<br/><br/>Nero is upset that Obi Wan could not save Alderan from annihilation, so when he is sucked forever into the past, instead of warning his home planet and extracting the populous into his huge Death Star to save them, he haunts the skies for Old Ben, sorry Old Spock, to come back so that he can kill him. No Intelligent Life Found. At least, not aboard the massive mining vessel Nero captains. But then again, what's going on aboard the Enterprise is hardly better. <br/><br/>Spock (Young Spock, that is) maroons Kirk on Hoth (no, not Hoth, but who cares? It's Hoth) where Old Ben (Old Spock) is also marooned, but by Nero, and where Scotty has been stationed because he proved smarter than his instructors and it damaged their egos. But Old Ben knew that Han and Luke should be together, so he takes Luke to the sub station where Han is assigned and introduces him to Han and Chewy, while reminding Han that he's a first rate mathematician and demonstrates to him just how he changed the universe as it was then known. <br/><br/>This entire work is riddled with contrivances and stolen elements from Star Wars. So much so, that I cannot love this film as I once desired. If all you seek is a good summer Popcorn Flick, then this is it. But if you're a fan, even a casual fan (meaning you don't know the ship types, classes, and configurations by heart), of Star Trek, you will be disappointed by the lack of intelligence demonstrated in the overall execution of this work.<br/><br/>Star Wars has always been about the Human Condition, or if you prefer, the State of Heart. Star Trek has always been about the Human Psyche, or if you prefer State of Mind. This attempt betrays the entirety of 45 years of Star Trek history, and before you start telling me to get a life and stuffing me into my locker, you have to understand that for millions of franchise fans who spend billions of dollars on movies, merchandise, conventions, autograph collections, and signed memorabilia, this is serious business.<br/><br/>And while there are seven new members in key Star Trek roles, will their work be sought after in 45 years? If so, will it only be because they are ""part of the set"" or will it be because they were great at what they did? JJ Abrams, I have always loved your Bad Robot works, but I have to say that this was a vast disappointment, overall. The only part of me satisfied by this work is the part of me which needs huge, flashy, KABOOMy eye candy.<br/><br/>All in all? It's for action/science fiction fans, and fans of popcorn movies, NOT fans of TOS, TNG, or DS9. It holds some great action, better effects, and brilliant casting...it just left the previous intelligence of Star Trek, at the door. But in spite of what I've written here, I did enjoy the film. <br/><br/>It rates a 6.5/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"Simon_Says_Movies","8","6","14","26 May 2009"," An infusion of pop culture relevance and unmatched entertainment
","Movies based upon material fuelled by a niche audience or cult following often faces hurdles right off the start. Aside from a loyal core audience, adaptations of television shows, comic books, certain books or even starring a certain actor need to up the ante for a big screen treatment. There are certainly times when a film is specifically intended to strike out only a small wedge of the public, but these are often low budget, spring releases baked later by DVD sales. For big budget, summer blockbusters on the other hand the studios chequebook is on the table along with the hearts of fans, and in the case of Star Trek they hit the jackpot.<br/><br/>As far as the Trek world is concerned I am the epitome of a novice. I have never seen a Star Trek movie, I have never watched any of the numerous and long-running television series and I constantly jest my friends who do. Drawn in by impressive trailers and a director who I more than respect, any doubt (or embarrassment) I had was whisked away faster then The Enterprise at warp speed. Funny, engrossing, from what I gather loyal buy wildly accessible and infinitely entertaining, director J.J. Abrams has infused a slowly withering slice of pop culture with pizazz and heart. In the same vein that Iron Man last summer drew in non-fans with likable actors, flawless production values and endless wit and charm, Trek neither panders to the fan boys nor ignores them and if this is to become a trend for blockbusters to come it would be most welcome.<br/><br/>Along with the budget and special effects, or to be more accurate, more importantly then the technical elements, Star Trek pulsates with life and the human element thanks to a superb ensemble cast. Before production began, all eyes were on the casting; chiefly that of James Kirk (famously played by William Shatner). Choosing a relative unknown, Chris Pine, for the infamous role could have sunk the film right off the dock yet his boyish charms, smooth line delivery and charismatic presence fills the role to the top. Equally if not more important is the role of Spock, played by Heroes star Zachary Quinto who nails it home with a nuanced but blistering performance. Not an actor does wrong in Trek, and the leads are bolstered further by the likes of Karl Urban as 'Bones' McCoy, the always hilarious Simon Pegg as Scotty, Zoë Zaldana as the silky Uhura, Harold and Kumar's John Cho as Sulu and up and coming star Anton Yelchin as Chevok.<br/><br/>In this origin story we see the slow assembly as the classic crew beginning with James Kirk's birth on the USS Kelvin in the heat of battle which results in the tragic death of his father. Years later, a misfit and self-proclaimed charmer he is sucked into Star Fleet by Commander Pike (Bruce Greenwood) who offers him, simply, more. Rising to the top of his class he soon finds himself and his future crew thrust into action at the whim of a Romulan madman known as Nero (An unrecognizable Eric Bana). As the stakes grow higher so do the tempers of the cocky Kirk and subdued Spock and it is this dynamic that makes the film truly great. The more detailed plot surrounding the story is complex but never confusing and I will leave it for you to experience.<br/><br/>When all is added up in the end, there is little fault to be found in Star Trek. The effects are sensational but remain secondary to characters, the performances are uniformly excellent and the pace is taut and the drama often tragic. So even to those (like myself) with really no initial interest in the Trekkie universe, give it a chance as it is an infusion of pop culture relevance and unmatched entertainment.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","As an old Trekker I have to point out that the movie lacks the connection with the Star Trek Universe that Gene set, totally! I don't know where to begin. From the script, the directing, the photography? It's just not Star Trek. One of the worst modifications is the change of the transporter (beam me up) effect to an extremely futuristic one that does not reflect the era of the story. Kirk is portrayed as a reckless rascal that doesn't really care about nothing and nobody but himself does not obey any rules or regulations and is arrogant to his mates and superiors. If you also add the total lack of the scientific support, you will easily come to understand that it is not Trek. For all us Trekkers, is a total disappointment. For the casual spectator, is just an other action movie. For sure no Star Trek however!"
"Thorsten-Krings","9","6","14","14 May 2009"," The film we have been waiting for since 1979
","This is the Star Trek film Trekkers have been waiting for for decades! True to the spirit of the classic series Star Trek tells the adventures of a young Enterprise crew on their first mission. The film is awfully well told and full of action and suspense. It's 127 minutes long and not one of them is boring. However, the film is engaging not only because it is a well made action film but also because it has strong and interesting characters. The acting is superb. With the exception of Chris Pine, all actors manage to make us recognize the original characters without just copying the original actors. Particularly Checkov as Wunderkind is a great character. Pine does not convince as Kirk. The story is Kirk's initiation into becoming a responsible officer but especially in the beginning Pine plays him too smug and too self satisfied. At the end there are a few moments when Shatner's suave performance shines through but all in all Pine lacks the ability to relate to the character. But since the film is more about Spock than Kirk it's not too much of a problem. All in all Stark Trek is one of the few adaptations of TV series that creates something new yet treats the originalm series respectfully."

","Two-thirds of the way through the movie 'Scotty' says something, and I realize, that's a part of his personality - and that even as a die hard Trek fan - I never noticed that about him before!<br/><br/>Looking at the movie 'quotes' I see there is a lot of dialog in Star Trek. The plot seems a poor rehash of Wrath of Khan. It doesn't make a lot of sense and with Star Trek the plot is usually carved in stone as a giant monolith. While the story doesn't make sense the crews actions and emotions do. In the best movie, Star Trek IV, the plot makes sense but it isn't taken too seriously. For what it's worth, I've alway been partial to Star Trek V too, a movie that for me went where no movie's gone before. <br/><br/>I've loved Star Trek since watching reruns growing up. A baby sitter must have sat me down in front of the original episodes when I was 3 or 4 corrupting me. The people who made this movie seem to love Star Trek too. Star Trek isn't perfect. . . but parts of it certainly were. Perfection. I'd like to see this crew return, not just for another movie but to a weekly TV show. The 'alternative-timeline' I think, makes it possible. Who wants to watch an adventure where you know what's going to happen in advance?<br/><br/>I was never quite comfortable with the humor. I enjoyed it, as well as the banter, but didn't laugh out loud? The closest being when Chekov couldn't pronounce 'Vessels' or something. One reviewer wrote (rightly pointing out the lack of fan-fare at Vulcan's destruction) ""Exciting, inviting and a little bit frightening (the new Chekov's accent is as unsettling as any planetary destruction)."" There was room for this movie to be embarrassing. I was certainly cringing right away. The longest cringe I've ever held in my life was when Kirk was being born. Kirk is being born while his father is going down with the ship - defending a Starship from attack. Was it some kind of extended baby-making commercial? A cheap attempt to pull on our heart strings, to inject some 'heart' into the movie? I might have been better with it if there were more humor here, say, in the manner in which race car driver 'Ricky Bobbys' birth is given levity. Then, 10 or 20 minutes into the movie a giant 'Star Trek' logo fills the screen. How long can one human being be stuck mid-cringe? I did enjoy Star Trek immensely, but it may be due to oxygen deprivation from having my face stuck in one position for 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I never knew Kirk was a genius. I remember an episode (that the original motion picture, and Star Trek IV, were loosely based off) where Kirk outsmarts a computer. Spock comments, ""A dazzling display of logic."" Kirk says, ""You didn't think I had it in me, did you Spock?"" Spock replies, ""No"". Here Kirk outsmarts Spock in one scene. No easy task. Star Trek does a good job making Kirk more human and at the same time building him up to almost God-like legendary status. Kudos to the movie makers.<br/><br/>One reviewer wrote, ""Star Trek was the last refuge of an old-fashioned style of acting, more commonly seen in old black-and-white Hollywood movies. It was fake, but it was classy."" The new movie seems more realistic. Another review said (and he did intend it as sarcasm), ""It moves at a breakneck speed. Sometimes you aren't even sure what's happening on-screen but you are sure that you like it."" There's meaning here but it comes in snippets of information. For example, early in the movie the villain says something but it doesn't really make sense until late in the movie. It is fast and furious in most parts. The action scenes do blend in well with the rest of the movie. Related or not, it's said IQ scores in industrial (TV watching) nations are rising.<br/><br/>It's one thing to like all the violence and fighting, action and special effects... I certainly did... it's another thing to say it's right. Star Trek reminded me of 'Cloverfield' in that sense. When I watched Cloverfield (also by JJ Abrams) I was thinking 'I love this movie' but maybe I shouldn't be? I give Cloverfield 10 out of 10. The visuals in the movie did make me sick. What's next? a movie has to make us laugh, cry, throw up for two days before it's good? It was only with thinking about Cloverfield, after the movie, that I realized what it was about: the bravery of the characters in the movie. Each braver than I would be, but believable.<br/><br/>I suspect there's something slightly 'American' about Star Trek. Star Trek is global so I suspect this is 'forgiven' (probably not the right word to use). It's also about the whole field of Science Fiction (some would say it's mostly about friendship). It is still 'idea' fiction, even if only in part. There's a story about how writers Isaac Asimov and John Campbell were invited to the moon launch. They shared a moment because they both knew science fiction played a small part in paving the way for the space program.<br/><br/>I know each generation forgets about the past, surpasses the previous generation... I know they are going to forget all about us... In 200 years they'll be saying in winter we put a tree in our houses and stood around and worshiped it. I don't mind being forgotten about. That would be a good thing. My opinion of the 20th Century and now the 21st is about what Bones McCoy's opinion of it would be. I know it is pride... and conceit... but it would be nice if there were a 'Star Trek' in that future."

Star Trek has been deadfor a while now and this was more than what it needed for a jumpstart. The new movie is more youthful in both a sense it is the story of the start of Captain James Tiberius Kirk and that it is a more modern and fresh take on the series, a good way to tap into the youth of the world.

","As a fan of this show from the beginning, I must say J.J. Abrams brought a ""look and feel"" to this movie that it would have been nice to have in 1966. Of course, back then the technology was quite primitive compared to the standards of today. The new movie brings tremendous action & adventure to the screen. The actors portraying the original crew were believable and did as well as anyone could expect considering they are attempting to create characters we have known for over 40 years.<br/><br/>As a story, the plot is okay at best. The use of time travel to tell this story (and from what it appears any future stories) ""differently from the history we know"" is disappointing. But the plot gets the writers out of being locked in to tell the original history as all die-hard Trek fans already know (I cannot say more without a spoiler here). Essentially, if you have ever followed Star Trek in the past, you have throw out ANY story lines you already know because this universe of Star Trek is NOT the same reality. If you can do that, then it is just another action packed sci-fi movie to be enjoyed totally on its own.<br/><br/>The writers did attempt to include Trek fans with many familiar elements such as Bones ""I'm a Doctor, not a ..."", Scotty ""givin the engines all I can Captain,"" Chekov with his thick Russian accent (you are just waiting to hear him say ""Nuclear Wessels""), and Kirk taking the Kobayashi Maru test.<br/><br/>Anyone that loves science fiction will likely find this movie fun to watch. But I think the reviews in the TOS camp will be divided. They will either love it or hate it. Young people today will definitely enjoy this movie and from this point on they hold the reigns of how they want the story to be told. ""The Great Bird of the Galaxy"" is gone but he will always be remembered for creating this wonderful ""Wagon Train to the Stars."" And even though Majel Barrett as the ""voice of the Enterprise"" has now also passed on, she will always be remembered for keeping her husband's story alive.<br/><br/>******** Spoiler ********** Personally, I would hope for the next movie to restore the time line and not continue in this alternate universe, but I doubt what I think is relevant when it comes to producing a blockbuster movie that will bring in millions of dollars."

","I AM a Trek Fan.<br/><br/>And, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Hitting the reset button from day one was a good idea. They tried and IMHO failed in this approach when they created the Enterprise television series. But here, they got it right.<br/><br/>J.J. is adept at storytelling (i.e. Lost & Alias) and it shows once again in Star Trek.<br/><br/>Most of the cast did a wonderful job capturing their elder-egos. Not only did they look the parts, but the new cast is uncanny in how they adopt the idiosyncrasies and even the accents of the original characters. (The exception to this was Chekov. He's no Walter Koenig) The effects were simply jaw dropping. I truly felt immersed in the experience. Space itself was grand, awe inspiring, and dangerous.<br/><br/>Taking Trek out of the equation for a moment, simply taken as a movie this was fantastic. Its what the Star Wars prequels should have been. The story was compelling, the characters believable, the drama palpable, and the humor was witty and well timed.<br/><br/>Now, putting Trek back into the equation, J.J. respected Canon, and at the same time gave himself a whole new universe of possibilities to play with. I can't wait for a sequel.<br/><br/>Finally, the gripes (you knew they were coming). I can't give it a 10 for one simple reason... CAMERA SHAKE!! Please, oh please will you hold the damn camera still?!?! Actually, thats probably not going to happen, this thing just netted 74 mil over the weekend... oh well, one can hope.<br/><br/>Thanks for the ride, J.J..

","Star Trek is the first movie I can recommend seeing this year. Star Trek was done very well. I give mad props for the well done cast selections. They really expand the movie and give it depth. Even the ""red shirt no name man"" is in the story. If you are looking for good sci-fi and some laughs, this is the movie for you. I enjoyed the story line and look forward to the next one that comes out. As with all sequels I hope that they are able to recast all these characters. There was a lot of time put into finding the right people. With that, I hope they don't loose them in the next movie, because the movie will suffer. An actor from Heros was hard to convince myself that he was a good guy and not the villain despite knowing he is a good guy in this movie. The movie does not require knowing the old story line to enjoy, but if you do, the you will love it. It is a longer length movie, but you will hardly notice the time go by unless you constantly look at your watch."
"DonFishies","8","6","14","10 May 2009"," The legend returns with enough action and fun for fans and non-fans alike
","As much of a film geek and a science fiction fan as I am, I have never been a huge fan of Star Trek. I enjoyed the films I did see, I appreciated the legendary roles inhabited by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Patrick Stewart to name a few, and understood quite a fair bit about the mythology that took place since the 1960s. But when Paramount announced a reboot, with J.J. Abrams at the helm, I got fairly excited. And luckily, for good reason.<br/><br/>Packed into a rather twisty and time shifty narrative, Star Trek details the lives of the most notable members of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and how they met and became a crew.<br/><br/>Saying anything more would ruin the fun and the surprises Abrams and Co. have in store for fans and non-fans alike. From moment one, it is clear this is less of a film for Trekkers (or Trekkies, depending on how you feel about the title) and more of a film for everyone. Yes, there are stills terms and races of individuals that will baffle anyone not acquainted with Trek-lore, but screenwriters Abrams/Michael Bay-regulars Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman never exploit this. They ensure that everyone will be able to get some semblance of understanding from what is going on and what is being said. There are plenty of laughs as well, giving the film a more universal feel even as it becomes nerve-wreckingly tense. They leave just enough room to stay true to the original films and shows, while carving out their own identity as well.<br/><br/>That idea inherently, is what makes this film work so well – it does not rely on everything that has come before to work now. Some purists may not appreciate the subtle and glaring changes the film makes to what has come before, but the film has the attitude of not caring and doing its own thing. There is enough originality and unique moments within the film that it is able to stand on its own. Yes, the original Spock (played again by Nimoy) is integral to the plot of the film, but he never gets in the way of the film being able to start up a new series, a new lore and a new generation of fans. Everything about this film feels like it has been treaded on before, but never like this. Everything old, feels new again. Even the special effects, so important to the series from the start, look incredible and more believable than anything we have ever seen in the franchise before. Anyone expecting something in the vein of what has been done before is going to be sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>While I will not complain about the far too common lens flare that appears in an abundance of scenes, but the film does drag itself out in some cases. There is a lot to digest and a lot of characters to flesh out, but for a movie that starts off with the speed of a lightning bolt, it slows down a bit too much in the middle area of the film. It manages the rare challenge of remaining interesting throughout, but it feels like it spreads itself too thin in its midsection. While a lot of recent films seem to have trouble in their pacing, this film especially could have done with a few minor cuts.<br/><br/>Despite having a relatively little-known but being fairly recognizable, the cast is excellent in their performances. Chris Pine has just enough arrogance, swagger and charm to embody the eventual Captain Kirk from his first appearance on-screen through the finale. He does not descend into the overacting and self parody of Shatner before him, but he is believable enough to be a younger version of the well-known character. Although known more for being a villain, Zachary Quinto manages to give a stunted and emotional performance as the near-emotionless Spock. He still has the gleam of a villain in his eyes, but he has enough power and gravitas in his performance, especially when we can easily compare him to the original and legendary Spock (credited as ""Spock Prime"" in the end credits), that it is obvious he was born to fill the shoes.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty, all put forth great work in their supporting performances, no matter how silly some of the material is (Yelchin's Russian accent is stretched a little too far, but is not overbearing). I would have liked a little more of Pegg, but he easily steals the majority of scenes he appears in. Karl Urban stands out among the supporting cast for his straight-laced and often hilarious rendition of Bones. I am not as familiar with the original character as most, but while everyone else is either being dead serious or as offbeat as they come, he gets the most time to just kick back and have fun with his lines and actions. One particular scene involving multiple diagnoses on Kirk is masterfully done by Urban, who despite being set back by a few cheesy lines, makes the performance as strong as any other. Eric Bana, as the Romulan villain Nero, gets a few seriously deadly moments on screen, but is not nearly as fleshed out as everyone else. We understand his motivations, and he appears on-screen frequently, but he just does not have the same spark as everyone else does.<br/><br/>For only his second feature, and such a huge project, Abrams has delivered a fine product that is easily the first great film of 2009. The short delay only helped the picture become even better than it could have been. The cast is great, the story is well done, and the film is more fun than I ever imagined it could have been. Here's hoping for a great summer of film.<br/><br/>8.5/10."

","This is an elegant and action-filled restart of a 43-year-old TV series.It starts in the middle of battle and never lets off.I had to be dragged to this movie in a way. Yet once the lights went down and the explosions started (I'm a guy, forgive me Mother Theresa) I was hooked. We go back in time to Captain James T. Kirk 's troubled childhood,circa 2300-something A.D., through his near-dismissal from Star-fleet Academy. James was a ne'er-do-well on the farmlands of Iowa headed for a troubled life and the famous Captain Pike recruits him for the Star-fleet Academy. Although he's almost too screwed-up to attend such a disciplined place, James Kirk is there at 0800 hours after a long night of drinking and fighting in a dumpy bar, and gets on board,so to speak. The beauty of this script is the noble, strong and forceful presence of old-time Science Officer Mr. Spock, portrayed here as a young handsome and valiant man by Zachary Quinto. Spock is an instructor at The Academy who initiates disciplinary action against Cadet James Kirk for cheating on an essential,impossible exercise. The action goes to high-gear as the Academy's cadet corps are mobilized to fight an impossible foe with the Star-fleet Command. Through twists and turns now-Officer Kirk and Mr. Spock mobilize near-limitless inner resources and superior command-level skills to solve problem after problem with grace and courage that is charming and stunning.In sum, they're near super-heroes, in all their Technicolor glory.God, what a great story. This is a high-level re-vision of a tired workhorse series that is a gift to fans from whatever era of the franchise in Movies and TV."

This newest version of Star Trek is sure to wind up on a lot of those ""must see movie"" lists. It was totally a very pleasant and uplifting experience watching this movie. It was witty, funny, emotional and also visually appealing as well. The acting from all of the cast was excellent, with very little ""cheesiness."" I went into expecting it to be good because I am such a big fan of Lost, and I know what Abrams is capable of, but came out with only a greater respect for his cinematic capabilities. I only gave it nine stars because I am saving number ten for the sequel! Live long and prosper Abrams!"

Stunning images, slick set design and pretty actors put a polish on Roddenberry's universe that hasn't been seen since Star Trek: The motion picture took the show to the big screen.<br/><br/>However, behind the facade lurks simplicity. Lightning fast cuts and blur may be state of the art in the editing room but they also try to create excitement where the story just barely holds up to TV show standards and not at all to some after-screening scrutiny over drinks.<br/><br/>Success is quite likely and the seeds for a new franchise are sown, if with a heavy hand - after all that's what a reboot is about.

","OK this my second review of this movie. The first time I wrote it straight after seeing it at the cinema, then later I watched it again when it was released on DVD. And then I thought what a turkey! <br/><br/>After re-reading my first review I believe I was delusional. I must have hoped that the movie was going to be so good that it at first I had some sort of placebo effect. But seeing a second time I realized it was terrible. Three things make a good movie, the actors, the director, and the script. You can occasionally escape this trio if you get an inept director or a bad actor, but NEVER with a bad script.<br/><br/>The actors were good, they had to be to able translate this wham bang script to a believable level. The director, OK, he too, was good, but frankly he was in charge, couldn't he have looked the script and asked what high school kids were responsible for this.<br/><br/>The script, well it was almost religious text. That is because it was so holy. Plot holes galore. <br/><br/>Previously I used the term Wham Bam. That's what this was, all lights and sound, no content. The plot was ridiculous, every time they wrote themselves into corner they use techno babble to get themselves a freebie and trust me there was a lot of those. See ""intergalactic beaming to a starship at warp"" <br/><br/>I have looked back on the writers previous efforts. Mediocrity springs to mind.<br/><br/>And finally it is uniquely obvious the writers and director have no idea of plausibility. They create such a plot holes that Nero's Star Ship could fly through. <br/><br/>How can Kirk possibly jump from Cadet to the Captain of Star Fleets newest Starship just because he did a great job. In the movie he was able to jump 6 levels of promotion. Spock who a Commander, 5 levels above the cadet happily handed over command? Why?<br/><br/>Was it just Spock and Pike who were on board the Enterprise above the rank of Lieutenant? I am sure they have other Captains and Commanders in Star Fleet with the experience and seniority available. <br/><br/>I can imagine the scene in the Board of Review. ""We have 2 applicants for the new post of Captain. One guy has had 20 years of Service and has had 3 commands OR CADET Kirk with 3 years of recruit school, who has a history of fighting authority, has no experience with handling ships personnel but who, with the help of some other young recruits and a Commander with emotional issues saved Earth."" <br/><br/>Gee lets pick Kirk, cause it's a movie."
"meeza","3","5","11","11 April 2010"," A far out disaster!
","Call me a strange earthling who does not venture into the popular planet of Trekkies, but I still don't get the fascination of the ""Star Trek"" phenomenon. And Director J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek"" flick for the present generation did not generate interest for me to get on trek to Trekkieland. In fact, I found the latest ""Star Trek"" movie adaptation so repulsive and ridiculous, that I have been promoted to Vice President of the UFO (Untrekkie Fascist Organization). Abrams attempted to go where man has gone before way too many times, tell a tale of the origin of popular TV characters of an infamous TV show. So yes, we do discover how Captain Kirk became the entrepreneur king of the USS Enterprise; how Spock was all ears on seeking vengeance for the destruction of his planet Vulcan; and who were Kirk and Spock's parents, and how they played a part in their Enterprise Rent-A-Ship senior citizens program. OK, disregard the last one; I was pun-spaced out! We even have a Leonard Nimoy sighting in this latest ""Star Trek"" as an older version of Spock who actually somewhere in the film confronts the young version of Spock. Nimoy's ""In Search OfToo Many Spocks"" was featured oddly there. The rest of the Enterprise gang joins in for this film version also: Dr. Bones McCoy, Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott, Sulu, and Uhura. None of them are engaging or charismatic, but if I had to beam up a winner, I would select Scotty; who was pegged in nicely by comedic British actor Simon Pegg's commendable performance. The rest of the thespian enterprise of ""Star Trek"" was a disaster including Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Eric Bana as the baddie Nero, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and John Cho as Sulu. And even though Abrams was able to Finding Nimoy, old Leonard did not bring much to the older Spock characterization. Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman's script of ""Star Trek"" did not live long and prosperous in my attention span, too impractical and disengaging. Listen, I do not blame J.J. Abrams for his effort in piloting ""Star Trek"" for the present generation; but it looked like J.J. was lost in storytelling on presenting the film's narrative through a director's vision. I please want J.J. to give me back the two hours I lost in watching ""Star Trek"" but I know that is a mission that is impossible. Join the federation of Untrekkies and move into another cinematic galaxy devoid of ""Star Trek"". * Failure"

","Oh heck. Here we go: another review, with another opening disclaimer, to whit: I Am Not A Trekkie.<br/><br/>But (and it's a big but) I've been watching Star Trek off and on, small screen and large, for 40 years. Often it has entertained. Sometimes it has intrigued. And occasionally it has transcended both budget and genre with work amongst the most dazzlingly original ever to emerge from a TV or movie studio anywhere.<br/><br/>And then there's this movie.<br/><br/>It's slick, it's noisy, it's pretty much incoherent from beginning to end and it has as much to do with the provenance and traditions of Star Trek as it has to do with science fiction.<br/><br/>In other words: nothing at all.<br/><br/>For a couple of hours of passable entertainment value, it's OK though: the editing's good, the production values high, and both script and casting are not without felicities.<br/><br/>But a Star Trek opus it certainly ain't -- not in the sense of boldly going somewhere, of exploring new worlds, of confronting the vastness of space from the perspective of ordinary mortals.<br/><br/>That's because there's no humanity in this Star Trek. At all. Every character could as well be a Romulean. Or even, a dustbin.<br/><br/>Sure, it was always bound to excite passion amongst Trekkies, and that passion is admirable: compare the 'for' and 'against' reviews on here and the most articulate, well-ordered and well-founded are those to whom the movie rates less than zero.<br/><br/>For those of us who aren't Trekkies, however, there's neither pride nor passion.<br/><br/>Just the thought that Star Trek, at its best, really was so uniquely brilliant that nothing can destroy its memory or its reputation.<br/><br/>So although this latest effort, such as it is, may well destroy the franchise, that really doesn't matter.<br/><br/>This Star Trek is just a movie, as glossy, shallow and self-serving as the world from which it has sprung.<br/><br/>The real Star Trek sprang from a quite different world, and if you weren't around then, when traffic stopped and we stood in the streets to watch the live transmission of men landing on the Moon, when Star Trek truly was of its time, well. . .<br/><br/>Tempus fugit.<br/><br/>Sadly."
"ZombieMcQueen","10","5","11","16 January 2010"," An enjoyable new visioning.
","I went the opening day to see Star Trek with my dad, both of us being great fans of Gene Roddenberry's masterpiece of social commentary and adventurous storytelling. It has been said that ST'09 removes a good 40+ years of Star Trek canon. firstly, not including this outing, the original cast adventures (which this film is based upon) technically only makes for little more than ten years of the Star Trek longevity; Three for the original series, two for the animated series (which is constantly being debated as actually being canon or not), seven films based around the original cast if one includes Generations, and the handful of canonical books Roddenberry himself wrote. But I digress; onto the film itself:<br/><br/>With all honesty, I was hooked into the movie from the first minute. While the opening approach of ST'09 introduces newcomers to the Trek universe, as the final shots of the opening scene brought back the emotional impact of The Search For Spock's moral: ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"". ST'09 however, brings this to what is possibly an even more , as we see what is amusingly fitting as the birth of James Tiberius Kirk. From then on, the film works the Star Trek magic with superb character interaction, lead by Chris Pine's spot-on Young Kirk, Zachary Quinto's fascinating if somewhat reverse portrayal of Spock, and the return of the unforgettable Leonard Nemoy; moving cinematography, which opens your mind and intrigues your heart at the same time; and an impressive orchestral score that stands among the best in all of Star Trek's musical history. the story itself is fascinating as well, and never reveals itself too early; instead, the film keeps us watching more and more with the progression of each scene. <br/><br/>And yes, there are the nods to the pop-culture knowledge of Star Trek (Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not ...), but there is even more than that. Various canonical elements of the series is not only brought back to fill in some story-associated gaps, but to further the impact of the film's sense of canon with the fans. I won't go into them here (partially because IMDb's word limit restricts it), but all of these elements come forth in the film to not so much create a new Star Trek for people to follow, but to make the Roddenberry-created universe even more full. Granted, Abrams had previously said that he was originally not a fan of Star Trek, but there is simply too much of Star Trek here to disregard all the previous adventures,(perhaps unwittingly) keeping the original canon intact.<br/><br/>Of course, nothing is without its problems, certainly not a Star Trek film. the inherit problem of this outing is that, while it is based upon the original series, the style of film-making and story-telling used here is quite dissimilar to what its fans know and love: for better or worse, ST'09 is undeniably J.J. Abrams. From what I have seen in Lost and Cloverfield, Abrams' signature visual style is quickly-paced camera switches and the occasional appliance of 'jumpy' camera effects, and it returns in this film. This could be particularly distressing to fans, whom are more at home with the visual style of the original show and films, where every scene was focused on small groups of characters or some centered object. In ST'09, dozens of things just seems to happen all around at once, which can be exciting but also distracting. If anything, ST'09 borrows the same modern-day method of ""involving action"" seen in First Contact, Insurrection, Nemesis, and the last couple of series'. Likewise, Abrams love of large monsters returns in what feels like somewhat of an unnecessary action/lead-up scene. what also feels missing here is the sense of philosophy: the original Star Trek series and films all bared a strong sense of what is morally right or wrong, which is only partially touched upon in this movie. Another problem here is that, largely due to canonical references, this film is essentially a part of Star Trek lore: meaning that people coming into this with no previous care or knowledge of the series will be missing a lot, and may not even get into it. <br/><br/>Overall, ST'09 is a well-conceived film and one fun ride. Sure, it's not quite as fantastic an outing as The Wrath Of Khan, The Undiscovered Country or maybe First Contact, but it doesn't fail fans and non-Trekkies nearly as much as The Motion Picture. Fans will see this, of course. Casual movie-goers - you may find a good bit of enjoyment here, but some of you who enjoy a bit less sci-fi may wish to avoid it all the same. Personally, when I witnessed the traditional closing shot of Star Trek, I knew I had just been through yet another satisfying adventure of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and couldn't wait for the next one.<br/><br/>Until next time, Live Long and Prosper."

","The actors who played the roles of Kirk and Spock do deliver; they make you feel you're watching the originals once again. This is no small feat. However...<br/><br/>A number of things in the plot are meaningless. Young Kirk doesn't care for his own life or any form of authority, yet he enters Star Fleet Academy quite easily. He goes from nobody to captain in a few years. Spock is a poor victim, losing the command of Enterprise due to a plot set by his best friend Kirk and masterminded by... himself!<br/><br/>Some unnecessary, hard-to-believe skydiving, as if no other advanced, more effective and safe way were available five centuries ahead in the future to get the job done. Each of the skydivers using shinny, color matching suit and helmet, one color for each guy. Blah!...<br/><br/>Eric Bana is Eric Bana; he will never pass as a disgruntled Romulan captain. This is not his fault; he is just one of those guys whose fame and outstanding performance make it hard for the viewer to forget who he is and accept him as a part of the Star Trek lore.<br/><br/>The Romulan engineer who designed Bana's ship must be a lunatic, as notwithstanding being capable of creating a time traveling starship, its interior is full of deadly dangerous, absolutely nonsensical pitfalls.<br/><br/>And what happened with that beloved Trekkie planet called Vulcan??!! It seems it was destroyed in a time before the original series! I still don't know. I hate time loops.<br/><br/>Finally, the Enterprise... In sharp contrast with the beautifully rendered, all-glass bridge, it doesn't take much to realize that the engine room is just an old, ordinary, 20th century industrial plant used as a studio set, without any preparation whatsoever except for some bad C.G. to create a useless tube full of liquid. My guess is the budget had already been spent when the engine room's shootings began.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I admired Chris Pine's and Zachary Quinto's great performances, and those of other very good actors, but the things aforementioned caused some distractions that prevented me to fully enjoy the movie."

I really wanted this movie to re-boot the franchise so that I could continue to have new Star Trek movies to watch. Even after I first saw this movie, the day it was released, I was trying to tell myself that I loved it. I tried to excuse it for all its blockbuster simplicity and its lack of depth. But in the end I honestly felt like ""Armageddon"" had been remade with characters with Star Trek names. While it was a good action flick, even an excellent action flick, it just was not Star Trek.<br/><br/>The best Star Trek always asked questions. It always presented difficult social questions in a way that people could see them for what they were, without throwing them in their faces with platitudes and slogans. I remember the presentation of torture in the ""Chain of Command"" episode of the Next Generation. I remember the Voyager episode ""Prey"" asking questions about the sanctity of all life. And almost every episode of the original series asked very important social questions.<br/><br/>And there were the science elements of the fiction in Star Trek. The communicator became the cell phone of today. The Army is working on a real phaser (PHASR - with stun). And many of the ideas in the episodes were inspirational to real scientists (there is a real theory for warp drive in physics today).<br/><br/>So, what did the new movie give us: Red Matter and the importance of teamwork . . .<br/><br/>In the end I can't bring myself to consider this real Star Trek. It's a blockbuster action movie, and a good one, but it doesn't wrestle with serious issues, it doesn't play with scientific ideas, it really doesn't make you think at all. It's just a shoot-em-up where the good guys win, bad guy looses and the special effects are great. But it's not really Star Trek."

Nonsense follows nonsense follows nonsense. Read the critics below - they are absolutely right. It's a ridiculous movie. Not because it's about space ships and time travelling and all that stuff. It's because the makers decided to create a stupid, speedy, action packed movie for bald entertainment instead of some clever, speedy, action packed adventure. Wait a moment... maybe they didn't actually decide to do so. We'll see how many hollow sequels will follow before the rats are leaving the sinking ship."

","I am a fan of most of the Trek series, even the original. I was not one of those people, though, who could recite Trek history to you, or who would groan when a series episode would violate some part of the Trek history. However, this script was brilliant. The way they presented the story, it not only became a reset of the characters, but actually became a reset of the whole Star Trek universe. The film was quite enjoyable. The writers and actors played great homage to the original characters, while adding their own unique spin. And it was quite interesting to see the back story of how the incredible crew of the Enterprise came to be. Humor and action abound, and the characters are extremely likable. The script was very well done. I look forward to the next installment. 10 out of 10."

","Admittedly a newbie as far as the ""Star Trek"" lore is concerned -- substantiated by an admission that my acquaintance with the iconic sci-fi is limited to the ubiquitous pop culture references (""Beam me up Scotty!"") -- my accession to J.J. Abrams' re-imagining/re-boot/re-whatever of Gene Roddenberry's interstellar mythology is almost of a purely virginal viewpoint, a perspective that should supposedly raise eyebrows among Trekkies for the liberal interpretation done with this franchise restart. Nevertheless, in ""Star Trek"", for all the acrimony to hardcore fans that it might stimulate, Abrams acutely goes for less than a self-conscious nod to its highly esteemed source than a crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster with a broader appeal, typified by its decision to bypass its predecessors' heady issues and moral dilemmas in favor of peachy visuals and aggressive storytelling, resulting to a spectacle that dazzles and a ride that only purists and the most churlish wouldn't cotton to.<br/><br/>Years after the death of his father trying to save his starship's people, James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) grows up to be a rash hotshot squandering his life away in the cornfields of Iowa, where he is convinced by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to join Starfleet Academy and follow in his father's footsteps. This brings him face to face with Spock (Zachary Quinto), a smart-ass once bullied for his half-human, half-Vulcan bloodline and from here, it pretty much hovers around establishing the relationship between these two while readily introducing other characters into the fray: Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Scotty (a marvelously cast Simon Pegg).<br/><br/>It's to Abrams and screenwriters Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman's credit that the film zips along through gripping action scenes while still accomplishing to have its actors breath life to their roles, as embodied by Pine and Quinto's soulfully vulnerable rendition of their iconic characters, the same amalgam that has made the Abrams-directed ""Mission: Impossible III"" and Abrams-produced TV shows ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" work. It's a thrill ride that eschews whatever social undertones its previous installments allegedly dearly hold on to, instead going through a candid space opera, a zippy galactic adventure that gravitates one in and makes it, well, futile to resist."

","Star Trek is an unnecessary reboot in my opinion. JJ Abrabs is a talented filmmaker and it is easy to see his enthusiasm (he is almost like a fanboy giddily recreating all his favorite childhood movies) and rigor but the reboot and especially the cast will always suffer from comparison with the original TV series. Furthermore, although the film is interesting and gets everything sorted- in as much as one can in less than 2 hours- there is a rushed feeling to the proceedings. The special effects are good but we've seen it all by now, the razzle and dazzle only goes so far. The Star trek reboot isn't a bad film as much as an unneeded one."

","Star Trek is the best movie of the summer so far. While I'm no Trekkie, I was able to appreciate the delicate balance between making an summer-adrenaline movie with an attractive young cast while staying true to spirit of the original series. J.J. Abrhams has, in effect, done for Star Trek what Christopher Nolan did for Batman: get rid of the cheesy elements that made the series a laughing-stock while drawing out the raw power of the core themes and characters. Just like Nolan, Abrams has allowed the nerds to say to the mainstream public: ""See? That's why we're so into this!""<br/><br/>The story is good and the jokes hit the mark about 80% of the time, but the cast is where it's at. Chris Pine is makes for an entertainingly arrogant Kirk, and Heroes' Zachary Quinto is fine as Spock, but I'm all about the supporting cast, especially Zoe Saldana's strong Uhura, Karl Urban's (The Lord of the Rings) surprisingly funny take on Bones McCoy, and the pies de resistance, Simon Pegg, underused but awesome, as Scotty. If you've seen Shaun of the Dead and/or Hot Fuzz, you know Simon Pegg is the shiz. The Leonard Nimoy cameo is perfect, the action thrilling. My grade: A"

J J Abrams nailed this one on the head with a balance of a fantastic story, renewing the series for the newer generation, and combining it with stunning audio- visuals still holding up as astounding even by today's standards. The plot-line is relatively unorthodox, and is a strong, relatively sound script, with a bizarre and fascinating twist to it. This film is worth every minute and is captivating start to finish. The film has also been somewhat criticized for it's overuse of added in anamorphic lens flares, however I personally believe it is in the director's best interests to utilize this as to give a shiny, futuristic radiance to this fifty year old franchise."

"joshuadrake-39480","10","2","3","1 May 2015"," Good job, J.J. Abrams! Great STAR TREK reboot ever.
","The 2009 STAR TREK reboot is amazing and J.J. Abrams did a very good job with this movie and I like it.<br/><br/>The story of the 2009 reboot follows James T. Kirk and Spock aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero, a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The story also takes place in alternate reality due to time travel by both Nero and the original Spock.<br/><br/>The alternate timeline was created in an effort to free the film and the franchise established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving the original story elements.<br/><br/>The film is directed by J.J. Abrams (who also produced Cloverfield, directed it's sequel, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, Mission Impossible III and the upcoming seventh STAR WARS film saga, EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS) with a screenplay written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Fringe, The Legend of Zorro, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Cowboys and Aliens, Mission: Impossible III) and they really did a good job with a good screenplay and direction.<br/><br/>I love this story and even though I have seen only three of the films, STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK, STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME and STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER, I did not know what STAR TREK was, but I knew what STAR WARS was and it was really fantastic.<br/><br/>So, I had the guts to watch this movie and I thought I would end up saying, ""What in the hell did I just watch?"", but after it ended, I said ""That was fantastic. I hope there is a sequel to this movie someday."" and there is. I will watch the sequel and then I will review it.<br/><br/>The character development and storyline were really amazing and fantastic and extraordinary, man. It is just amazing and fantastic to see this movie last year in 2014 on FXX and I recorded it from my DVR and watched it and thought it was cool.<br/><br/>Chris Pine plays James Kirk and he is amazing, as well as Zachary Quinto playing Spock, the younger version and the late Leonard Nimoy as Prime Spock. Eric Bana plays the villain Nero wonderfully. The rest of the cast that includes John Cho as Sulu, Ben Cross as Spock's father, Sarek, Bruce Greenwood as Admiral Pike, Simon Pegg as Scotty, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov, Winona Ryder as Spock's mother and Zoe Saldana as Uhura all deliver great performances and there are some minor appearances by the film as well.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth, yes, Thor is in this movie as Kirk's dad, George Kirk, Jennifer Morrison as Kirk's mother, Winona Kirk, Rachel Nichols as Gaila, Deep Roy as Scotty's assistant and Tyler Perry as the head of Starfleet Academy, Admiral Richard Barnett and they all do a really good job.<br/><br/>The visual effects, sound design and makeup are really amazing in this film and I am surprised that the make-up won an Oscar at the 82nd Academy Awards. The film is well shot and I give credit to Daniel Mindel, who does a good job in this film. The music by Michael Giacchino was really cool and I liked his musical scores for Super 8, The Incredibles and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which I reviewed also on here.<br/><br/>This movie really deserved that critical acclaim and the critics took this movie really seriously, but also said that this film polarized some Star Trek fans and this film is just amazing in every way.<br/><br/>STAR TREK gets a 10 out 10 from me."

"erwhun","2","2","3","28 February 2014"," A backwards view of women, cheap dramaturgical approach, but great scenery
","This is a sexist movie with a cheap dramaturgical approach, far from the quality of, say, Star Trek: Voyager.<br/><br/>There isn't one independent female character, and the ones that exist with lines are there only to support the male characters. I would have loved to see more female characters with their own mind, opinions, thoughts, initiatives and who where there not just to interact with the male main characters but in their own right. Furthermore basically all young female characters wear short skirts. It does not pass the Bechdel test either. Coloured people are more or less conspicuous by their absence. The beautiful diversity of America is not reflected, which is even more strange considering the entire world is supposed to be one united federation.<br/><br/>Dramaturgically the movie is not much to hang on the wall either. Repeatedly the movie uses ""fear of heights"" where the characters hang from cliffs or platforms, but are saved in the last second. There are also a few monsters (aliens) chasing the characters, and in order to portray how scary they are, the monsters are randomly roaring and snorting - giving those scenes an almost childish impression. <br/><br/>What's good about this movie is the well-made, computer generated, scenery, and the plot. The scenery is detailed and beautiful, and often you spend time looking at the surroundings rather then the characters. Plotwise it is not too far from the high standards of Star Trek: Voyager or Star Trek: The Next Generation.<br/><br/>To summarize this is a movie hardly worth seeing, but it is not without strong points. It displays a very backwards view of women and have a very simple dramaturgical approach, but the plot is fairly thought through and the scenery is great."
"narvinya","1","2","3","17 March 2013"," Stereotypes, prejudice, clichés.
","I didn't even bother watching the whole film. What a disgrace to Star Trek. It is full of clichés, American stereotypes and prejudice. This is not Star Trek, it is Independence Day, or Armageddon, but much much worse. I will not list the plot holes here like others have done (like that fact that they wouldn't have known about the Romulans yet!), but I was bothered by other things.<br/><br/>The first thing that made me go ""oh no"" was that corny scene at the beginning where the Captain sacrifices himself and the ship to save his wife and newborn baby, but he gets to hear the baby's screams before he dies. How original. I got annoyed. And then...<br/><br/>The girls at Starfleet Academy are wearing skirts, like Asian school girls. There is college dorm sex. The Russian boy (he looks like 12), Chekhov, has an awful exaggerated accent to add some comic relief, that falls flat. Kirk is not likable on any level and I didn't think the acting was that great. The women of Star Trek have always been respected, professional, yet here they are merely turned into sex objects. You would think that in the year 2254 they would be past all these things, the sexism and the prejudice. Like someone else said I too have always seen Star Trek as a future we shall aspire to. But not this, it was like stepping back in time to watch Road Trip or Not another teen movie, with a lot of explosions. Also, what are Star Fleet cadets doing at a bar in Iowa? The Academy is in San Francisco! <br/><br/>A little research and a desire to reach above simplistic, Hollywood college/action movies and this film could have been so much more. How the hell did these filmmakers get their jobs?"
"mike-2195","1","2","3","5 February 2013"," Not For Original Trekkies
","First, I have little respect for JJ Abrams, as he has no respect for the original stories he chooses to rip off and mutilate. Every story I grew up with and loved that Abrams has put his hands on has been turned into a memory I'd now prefer to forget.<br/><br/>This movie was awful to say the least. The story, the plot, the visual effects, all left nothing desirable to remember.<br/><br/>As for our favorite characters, Abrams attempts to remake them all in his image with way over the top behavior characteristics and childish comic relief. It was more like a parody of Star Trek rather than a faithful follow up to over 20 years of TV and movies.<br/><br/>Everything in this film is implausible and unbelievable for Trek fans. Kirk is an adolescent rebellious punk with absolutely no respect for anyone. Spock and Ahura are in love like a pair of teenagers - which is impossible for Vulcans, even Spock who is half human. Further, Spock and Kirk hate each other. And Sulu is a Kung-Fu fighting ninja wielding a space age auto-fold-up pocket sword. And the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>The interior of the Enterprise looked more like a lady's dressing room with extremely bright pink and white lights encompassing the entire bridge.<br/><br/>The enemy had the worst makeup job of all, using henna ink to create nothing more than a sign-of-the-times facial tattoo.<br/><br/>Honestly, the original TV show had better effects than this film. Technically the CGI may be more advanced, but the over indulgence of it ruins the overall results.<br/><br/>I don't know what Abrams is thinking when he takes on these projects, but I personally wish that he would leave my childhood favorites alone and do something original of his own. Frankly, I don't think he has the capability.<br/><br/>Bottom line here is that if you are an original Star Trek fan, stay away from this piece of trash and anything else produced by JJ Abrams, otherwise you are sure to be in for a major disappointment."

Back in the day of Mr Roddenberry,the series had heart.Yes it was clunky,hokey and sometimes a bit portentous,but it was never mechanical. The 2009 version has no warmth,no characters even remotely vulnerable. Kirk and co have been turned into standard Hollywood superheroes with only the faintest resemblance to real human beings. Yes it's clever - clever;it might even be post -modern ironic (if I knew what that actually meant)but it's superficial gloss should not to be allowed to disguise it's shortcomings. You can ironically or otherwise refer to as many other films as you want,but you can still end up with something resembling a Steven Seagal movie with a billion dollar budget - and the new ""Star Trek does just that ."
"funero","6","2","3","27 September 2009"," Mindless summer blockbuster disguised as Star Trek
","I'm not a ""Trekkie"". I never watched the original Star Trek series, New Generation, Voyager and that last series, whatsitsname. I saw several episodes of that space station thing and wasn't very impressed. I also saw all the Star Trek movies, and found them ranging mostly between above and below average.<br/><br/>So while I'm obviously not a Star Trek fan material, I always had sort of weak spot towards the whole concept behind the franchise. Rosy, idealistic future, science-worship induced optimism and cerebral atmosphere were so much different than anything else on TV or big screen, like a little part of the 60-ies that somehow just wouldn't die.<br/><br/>Well, it's sure dead now.<br/><br/>A franchise reboot is only as good as the part of the franchise it manages to revive. Which makes this movie a very, VERY bad reboot. And not much better film either.<br/><br/>I won't dwell much on scientific inaccuracies, plot holes, unmotivated characters and forced action scenes that perforate the script into a giant incoherent mess; you can read about them in all the other 2- star reviews on this site. For me, the biggest letdown of this movie lies in the very idea behind it - trying to make an intense, hip, COOL action film out of a material that was never meant to be intense, hip or cool, let alone action.<br/><br/>Apparently, the producers' idea to revive Star Trek was to keep only the outermost shell of what constitutes this franchise (basically, uniforms, character names and starship models) and replace everything else with a grotesque combination of a Jason Bourne-esquire shaky-camera action and Han Solo mentality. In the process, Star Trek ceased to resemble itself. Clean-shaven well-mannered space cadets from the 22nd century communistic utopia suddenly started backstabbing each-other over rank (including stranding a rival crew-member on an icy planet), performing parachuting stunts through hundreds of kilometers of outer space and going alone into shootouts against an entire crew of a death-star-esquire spaceship. If the CGI department changed the ship models and pasted on different uniforms over the characters, the producers could have easily sold this as ""Star Wars 7"" and no one would have noticed the difference.<br/><br/>Of course, some would say, what's wrong with that? Who doesn't like Star Wars? Well, I like Star Wars plenty enough, but I like Star Trek too. Just because one seems to be more popular at the moment, doesn't mean we should just throw away the other one. Even if the pendulum of general public interest never swung back towards the more cerebral overtones of the classical Star Trek, there would have always been fans willing to keep the fire going; maybe with switching to lower-budget series and films, or even just comics and novels, but Star Trek franchise would have kept its place in history.<br/><br/>By turning it into a pale imitation of Star Wars, the producers had sold that place for a one-time profit of a summer blockbuster. It's their right, sure, but it sucks for the rest of us.<br/><br/>OK, so why did I give this 6, instead of 1 or 2 stars, like other critics? Well, even through all its rampart stupidity and missed potential, the movie was sort of fun in an empty-headed blockbuster sort of way. The actors did a splendid job of recreating old characters in their own way and CGI scenes were at times truly beautiful (especially during the no-sound scenes of outer space).<br/><br/>If you've never seen a 'real' Star Trek, are a Star Wars fan or just want some light-headed action-sf goodness, you'll probably enjoy this movie very much and subsequently contribute to its overinflated rating. Cheers."

However, I watched the first episode of TOS when it aired in 1966. I was 10 years old, and my entire world changed. I started to imagine a future - a future like nothing anyone had ever thought of before. That show was the catalyst for my love of the sci-fi genre, for many books and films over the years, in particular the many entries in the world of Star Trek. Honestly, this is a good little movie. It has the elements of Star Trek that make it what we loved - and love. The Prime Directive, the Enterprise, the themes of friendship and courage - the crew, the comedy, the rebellious nature of Captain Kirk - the new cast did such a great job portraying these beloved characters, I just felt I was seeing them all again, and I liked it very much. Don't get so hung up on what is Canon, and what is scientifically possible, that you forget to enjoy a tall tale - a story - with characters that are larger than life, and with whom we fall a little bit in love every time.

"budmassey","10","8","21","9 May 2009"," Quite possibly the boldest master stroke in movie history.
","It would not be an overstatement to say that this is quite possibly the boldest master stroke in movie history. After decades of derivative and diminished sequels and spin-offs, J.J. Abrams has managed to re-imagine the venerable classic in a way that is both true to the original and at the same time completely original. At the same time, he has rebooted the franchise in a way that will silence all the canon critics and created an independent and fresh future for years to come. Don't believe me? The sequel is already announced.<br/><br/>The problem with all the previous sequels was that they became increasingly diluted by budget constraints and cramped creativity as compared to their peers. With an estimated budget of $150 million, this sequel was anointed as the heir apparent to the franchise, and succeeded brilliantly.<br/><br/>Abrams could have approached this project with the cautious reverence it deserves, except that it deserved more, and Abrams knew it. We are given the obligatory historical references, and they are immensely satisfying, but they are also shrewdly seductive, as they lead us down the path of complacency. But from the beginning you get a sense that something isn't right, and you begin to wonder, ""is he blowing it here?"" These deviations accelerate and, before long, reach a point of no return. Now you're on the edge of your chair, where you belong, and you wonder how he's going to make it all right again. He doesn't.<br/><br/>Instead, we are shown a radically and irretrievably altered world where everything we thought we knew is swept away and replaced with a pristine tabula rasa. At last, Star Trek takes us, with glee and innocence, where no man has gone before. I would not have thought it possible, but this sequel is at once imbued with everything we liked best about the original series, and deviously enhanced by new possibilities, new capabilities, and a stunning Universe to once again explore anew.<br/><br/>There is time travel invoked, but, for once, it is not used as a Cosmic Mulligan. There is no do-over. A Romulan ship from the future arrives from a black hole to wreak revenge for a destroyed world, seeking to destroy other worlds in its path. The Enterprise and her intrepid crew, displaying all the humor, courage, and heroism for which we have come to love them, set out to save what is left of the Federation. If that doesn't make you want to see the movie, nothing will.<br/><br/>As a professor, I deal with people of all ages, all walks of life. Everyone I have spoken to raves about this film like none other that I can recall. As for me, I left the theatre with a feeling that maybe F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong when he said ""There are no second acts in American life."" That may have been true in Fitzgerald's time, but Star Trek, in all its revisionist glory, stands as proof that we live in a time when even the most tattered among us can reinvent ourselves with verve and purpose. Is this not the greatest gift that cinema has to offer?"

I'm not a die hard trekkie but I have been known to say on occasion, ""Everything you need to know in life you can learn from Star Trek.""

This movie has successfully given movie lovers a good believable story on the origins of it all plus a great story to introduce the chemistry which is so important in the Trek world.

Yes, every actor nails his or her character (possibly with the minor exception of Simon Pegg as Scotty, but that's a minor gripe). Also, this isn't just 'Star Trek The Early Years' - the story cleverly weaves in the old mythology - I won't say too much on that in case you're not aware of how it all plays out.<br/><br/>I will say that (if you can forgive JJ Abrams slightly overused 'lens flare effects') it is the most exciting of all the Trek movies. There's plenty of action and decent special effects. It doesn't quite rival Star Wars - it seems to be able to maintain its 'alternativeness' to the other great sci-fi franchise. It doesn't just breathe new life into the franchise (Star Trek X was a little disappointing), it makes 'Trek' accessible to the masses. If you don't know your Tribbles from your Borg, it really doesn't matter - this starts everything again and you don't need to know the backstory - you only need to be in for a good, popcorn-munching, sci-fi ride.<br/><br/>May this franchise live long and prosper."
"broadest","9","1","1","9 March 2015"," An Excellenty Executed Remake!!!
","I was sceptical about this film as remakes or modern adaptations at least a lot of the time fail and disappoint however this was certainly not the case for this film.<br/><br/>I'm not a massive Trekkie fan however I have seen a good chunk of star trek (original series), the next generation, deep space nine, voyager and of course the films that were released over the years and the key thing for me that has always had me hooked to star trek has always been the story. <br/><br/>Everything about this film works and is evenly balanced through the perfectly executed plot, its been a long time since I've been hooked to a film in general and I was gutted to see this film end.<br/><br/>Firstly the cast are perfectly cast Chris Pine is perfect as Kirk, he doesn't try to imitate William Shatners Kirk and that would have been a mistake but he is just as enthusiastic and passionate as Shattners Kirk and as the film went on I felt more and more 'yep this is the right guy'. I initially wasn't won over by Zachary Qunito as Spock due to his bigger build but he did win me over with his fantastic performance and delivery of lines. He was also enthusiastic, focused and as intellectual as Spock should be. John Cho, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban (though sometimes not always believable still gives the film a bit of a kick it needs) Bruce Greenwood are all perfect in terms of taking on the characters from the original series. On top of that I didn't realise Eric Bana was even in it until I saw the credits but he does a great job of Nero. My only niggle is that I'm not too sure on Simon Pegg. Now Simon Pegg is great and of course has excellent comedy timing but I'm not too sure about him playing Scotty. For one his Scottish accent wasn't very good and for me he just looked out of place in this film, of course he brought humour but is he as good a Scotty as Pine is a Kirk, I don't think so.<br/><br/>Bringing Leonard Nimoy in for Spock could have come across a bit cliché but thankfully the script made it so his character was essential and he played a very important part in the story and he does a fantastic job, it was great to see him in it and he brought so much to the film.<br/><br/>The visuals were fantastic, they were modern with a touch of classic star trek touches. The enterprise looked great, especially in warp speed. The bridge and the engineering room looked great, the costumes and make-up looked great, the environments looked great. Visually this film was spot on.<br/><br/>The story was great, I was hooked from start to finish. In the very beginning a massive event happens and from then on in the film is making you think and work out what could or might happen and the great thing is, its not predictable. There is a constant threat from the enemies in the film and this is all perfectly synced with Kirks introduction to the enterprise.<br/><br/>Overall a joy to watch, a great film and a timeless piece."
"jb_campo","8","1","1","8 March 2015"," Great start to rebooted Star Trek movies
","When Leonard Nimoy passed away this week, I thought it time to catch some of his last Star Trek appearances. The Star Trek movie 2009 does not disappoint.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the original series, you will love how this movie brings in many of the qualities of the original. Kirk as a brash, no- holds-barred kid who fears nothing. Spock battling his biracial status. Bones with his country doctorness. Checkov not being understood by the computer because of his accent. Sulu sword fighting. Scotty being able to do anything and laugh about it. But Uhura being ultra sexy and manning up to Spock - that was just great.<br/><br/>The evil Nero as the nemesis, and what he does, is incredible. The movie moves fast and furious as this space ship from the future comes to destroy the past. Common theme, with a great twist around Spock and Vulcan. <br/><br/>Love the action. Love the ending how Kirk and Spock conspire and like in the originals, split second timing saves the day. When the bad guy gets his due, you will cheer when Kirk says - You got it.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable fast-paced movie that will have you cheering and leave you wanting more. Enjoy."

","""Star Trek"" is a Sci - Fi movie in which we watch a man (James Kirk) who tries to live up to his father's legacy and also tries to save and fight for everything. We also watch a fight where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of it, and is the same legend which killed James Kirk's father.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because of the plot which I found it very good but also for the direction of it which made by J.J. Abrams and it was equally good. In addition to this I have to say that the Visual Effects of this movie were spectacular and gave a really different view in the whole movie. I liked the interpretations of Chris Pine who played as James Kirk and he was very good at it and Eric Bana who played as Nero and he was equally good at it. In this point I also want to mention that I liked the appearance of the original Prime Spock, Leonard Nimoy and about the interpretation of Zachary Quinto who played as Spock I believe that inevitably I compared him with the original and I had a neutral opinion about him.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""Star Trek"" is a great movie to watch and I am sure that you will like it very much. Also if you are a fan of Sci - Fi movies then I am definitely sure that you will love it. I strongly recommend it to everyone."
"bbickley13-921-58664","10","1","1","27 February 2015"," Made me a Star Trek fan again
","This film was a flawless blockbuster.<br/><br/>It was everything the series was in one movie or rather it was everything the pop culture phenomenon was in one movie. I've seen it umpteen times and every time I find a new reference from the series. Almost nothing these guys wrote was original, but tiny bits of pieces from the show. That should make any fan love this movie.<br/><br/>But don't worry, if you don't even know the difference between captain Kirk or Jean-luc Picard, it does not matter. All that matters is that you love a fun thrill ride, filled with high octane adventure. <br/><br/>As cheesy as JJ Anrams put it ""It's not your daddy's Star Trek"" it very for the times.<br/><br/>It does things the series could not do or for that matter the first set of movies.<br/><br/>At the same time, It was an great concept for a reboot as well that does not forget the source material it comes from. <br/><br/>Top ten of my absolute favorites."
"Tyrke","8","1","1","25 February 2015"," Fresh and different
","This review (at the current count) is the 1518th written by IMDb users, so I'm pretty sure everything was already said about this movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this film takes a different spin on the Trek universe. Having seen every ST movie and every TV series multiple times, the 2009 movie felt refreshing. A change of pace. Purists might nitpick and dissect it endlessly, saying it's not faithful/respectful to the previous incarnations.<br/><br/>Abrams' take is unique, as it modernizes the title. This time around, we're without Patrick Stewart or William Shatner, and that is actually good. You simply cannot take the same formula of extending an episode from the current Trek TV series into a feature length movie over and over again. For one thing, we currently lack said series.<br/><br/>In a way, Nemesis foreshadowed the change of tone to a more dark and unforgiving world, and even though it featured the TNG cast, it was already called the black sheep of the series.<br/><br/>This movie is distinct, carries the style of JJ Abrams (for better and for worse), while still paying homage on several levels to the old shows and feature films. It's fast paced, flashy and action packed. On the other hand, it lacks the careful buildup ST fans are used to.<br/><br/>Cinematography is also different, making use of modern (in my opinion, OK)CG techniques. The tones are high contrast, which is a mark of the digital age of movies. Both steadicam and shaky-cam shots are often used, you either like them, or you don't. To me, they felt alright.<br/><br/>Music is pretty good, atmospheric, and the main theme feels well suited to the film.<br/><br/>When I looked up reviews here, I got what I expected: either zeros, or tens. Movies like this are meant to split the crowd, and Trek has such a huge and devoted fan-base that this rift is totally justified.<br/><br/>If you're a skeptic/hater, give this movie a watch on it's 10th birthday, and see what you think of it then."
"drawlife","8","1","1","17 September 2014"," A Thrill Ride.
","When I first heard of this project, I initially disliked the idea because, I naively thought the old cast and crew of the original series or the Next Generation cast will return to the screen. Also another reason why I was turned off by it was because I had seen a couple of Star Trek films(did not watch the show) both original and Next Generation and I really didn't enjoy most of them, they just didn't do it for me. <br/><br/>However after seeing the trailers, it peaked my interest, and then I saw the film, and man was I dead wrong. <br/><br/>This movie is awesome. <br/><br/>Director J.J. Abrams revives this franchise with much needed flare. I understand there are some die-hard Star Trek fans out there that weren't okay with the fact that they used the time- traveling story device to throw aways almost 50 years of canon, but honestly I was totally fine with it. <br/><br/>I absolutely ate up everyone's performances. Chris Pine is sharp, full of wit and charisma with his Kirk. He evokes the iconic captain without a Shatner impression. Zachary Quinto is great as Spock, displaying his conflict as he is also half human, concealing his emotions. Pine and Quinto both emulate the Kirk and Spock relationship very well and brings more depth and complexity starting off as rivals.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana brings the emotional support and is a strong female character, however I did find the romance between her and Spock a tad bit awkward at times. Simon Pegg and Karl Urban bring out the best humor among the crew with their dialog and delivery in their respective roles as Scotty and ""Bones"" McCoy. John Cho and Anton Yelchin provide good supporting roles as Sulu and Chekov, they both play an integral part within the crew of the Enterprise. Bruce Greenwood is great as Captain Pike and provides a mentor-like relationship with Pine's Kirk. <br/><br/>Eric Bana as Nero is the weakest part in the film. Bana's performance is fine for the most part, although his delivery here and there was a bit dry, however the major flaw is that his character is a bit underdeveloped. I also questioned his tactics and logic within the film, I don't understand why he had to wait almost twenty-five years for Spock Prime(a role reprised by Leonard Nimoy) to take his revenge, or drill a hole to actually launch the red matter that creates a black hole. <br/><br/>The visuals are incredible, the USS Enterprise looked great, all the action set pieces are gorgeously shot. Abrams also uses a lot of lens flares but it only enhances the visual appeal, although he could have toned it down a little. <br/><br/>The films is about a little over two hours but it does not feel like it, the pacing is incredibly fast and flows very elegantly. Give credit to J.J. Abrams for reigniting this franchise and to his crew, especially his writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch it. It's very entertaining, full of fun, and a visual spectacle. <br/><br/>8.8/10"
"vince-86","6","1","1","20 January 2014"," JJ has destroyed the essence of Star Trek
","I worked on engines with my father when I was 6 years old. That was around 1970. Computers weren't controlling them, everything was done mechanically so they were pretty easy to understand; valves opened, a mix of fuel and air was created by the carburator and introduced into the cylinder chambers down the intake manifold. Valves closed, then spark, transmitted to the plugs via the coil & distributer, ignited the mixture forcing the piston down in it's chamber creating kinetic energy by turning the drive shaft which ultimately turned the tires making the car go. This is how all engines work. When I was a kid I thought Star Trek was really stupid but it was me who was ignorant. How is it that we always think something we don't understand is stupid? In 1970 the Enterprise's engine room and that warp core didn't look like any engine I'd ever seen. J.J. has dumbed the new S.T. down so far that I wouldn't have thought it was stupid if I was to have seen his version as a kid. This is the main reason I hate what he's done. He's doing such a disservice to the viewers. In many ways, by taking away the plausible advanced physics, he's aligned it - dumbed it down - so that the passive consumers who've been taking over for the last 30 years or so can easily understand it. Without curiosity we'll not go anywhere new, build anything great or create anything awesome. J.J. Abrams has made the Enterprise look like the U.S.S Apple-Store with an engine room from the U.S.S. Titanic Samuel Adams. In general something that fits into what an uneducated mind thinks it should look like and that's a bad thing. The engine room is the size of an Amazon fulfillment center, has .. what - like 20 freak'n warp cores? The only reason it's so huge and there's so many pipes and water tanks on a starship that uses anti- matter as it's primary energy source is because that imagery fits into what an uneducated mind - sadly a closed mind - finds familiar and comfortable. Anti-matter is the most powerful energy source known to man. It is real and awesome. 1 second of warp-core energy is equal to all electricity produced on Earth since there's been electricity production! It's power on a scale nearly unimaginable and truly nothing that's familiar. That's why the original S.T. was so great and J.J.s version pretty much sucks. In the original S.T., and all the movies and spin off series and in the real world of plausible physics - you'd only need 1 warp core, not much space for it (or water for that matter) and I only know this because when I was a kid I thought it was so stupid THAT IT PROMPTED ME TO LEARN HOW DUMB AND WRONG I REALLY WAS. It prompted me to read the blueprints, users manuals and technical books that my Trekky nerd friends had. That reading, that search for knowledge ultimately taught me that warp 5 wasn't the speed of light X5. It's the speed of light exponentially multiplied; SoL X SoL X SoL X SoL X SoL! These figures are off the charts fast covering distances incredibly vast! I write this for you, the new viewers, because J.J.s version won't prompt you to search for explanations of anti-matter and warp core engines so you won't experience the sheer awe these revelations the original S.T. lavished on me. J.J. is denying you of this. You'll not be prompted to learn that warping and much of the science on S.T. was conceived in the early 1900's by theoretical physicists Einstein, Rosen and Heisenberg - to name a few and unless you go to school specifically for this you'll not learn how they all wrote (and got published) papers on the physics used in Star Trek before there was common use of light-bulbs and air travel. You'll not learn that, by using antimatter, space is warped and it is moved around the ship effectively nullifying the galactic light- speed limit. Long before he was the nom de plume of the Walter White, Heisenberg (or more specifically the principal he created) predicted that you could never know where all the atoms in something were because just by observing/measuring them they are changed so something called the Heisenberg compensator is needed and is responsible for allowing the transporter to function. I'm not a professional who used this knowledge to further mankind but many other Trekkies - people who grew up in the 60's - are and have directly credited Star Trek for the innovations they've created. I learned about Einstein & theoretical quantum physics as a hobby because of the Original Star Trek. That's a great thing to glean from entertainment - knowledge of how the universe works. What is the J.J. version going to prompt you to learn? Sadly I believe - nothing. Now, after stating the above, I hate to say this but other than the disservice JJ's done in removing all the science they're not bad actors! Superficially its fun but compared to the original it's sadly lacking. Vince"
"Spondonman","7","1","1","13 October 2013"," It's a noisy cartoon, Jim.
","That I've got all 80 episodes of the original marvellous TV series on a titchy flash stick would have had Mr. Spock's eyes go round with wonder. I used to love those moral and intelligent stories with beginnings, middles and ends but by now Star Trek has now gone where no older man should really follow. This is cinema purely for kids of all ages or people coming across Star Trek for the first time with admirably open minds.<br/><br/>Young and brash James Tiberius Kirk comes of age as the Captain of the USS Enterprise spaceship, picking up his to be famous crew one by one to reboot the franchise, sorry, legend. On the way they have many loud and chaotic adventures, the main problem coming from a Romulan renegade from the future intent on making Spock watch his home planet Vulcan be destroyed. Belief must be suspended for the duration of the film but especially when young Kirk meets old Spock in the ice cave; it was so sloppy it had me too transfixed to laugh. At least Spock had his false teeth in.<br/><br/>The cgi cartoonery is slick, relentless, fantastic, brutal, confusing – in fact everything that is required nowadays, acting and physical sets are adequate, but of course the story comes a solid last as usual. Why couldn't the rogue Romulan and his crew on their trillion trillion dollar spaceship go back in time to save their planet from destruction instead of looking for a dubious vengeance for its said destruction? It's the ridiculous graphics that take the attention – as soulless, heartless and pointless as all the other bloated cartoons made nowadays – King Kong, Prometheus, Hobbit etc. There's nothing here that has added to the original series or inspired in me anything other than to watch the original series again – that at least was Star Trek after all. It looks good, isn't dull and passed the time for me, somehow. Ah well, now for Into Darkness!"

","Being a Star Trek fan does not mean you have to be a geek or a nerd. It just means you like one of the most profitable Science Fiction franchises of all time, only rivaled by the Star Wars franchise. I understand that there are some people out there that will say that they hate one of these two franchises, I am going to say something that will make them vomit. I am a fan of both franchises. Why can't you be a fan of one and a fan of the other?<br/><br/>That being said, I actually liked Star Trek. I think J. J. Abrams did a fantastic job breathing new life back into this franchise. He took all that we know about the universe of Star Trek and turned it on it's ear. J. J. Abrams was very smart about it, too.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much of the movie away because I think that it should be experienced rather than read about. Therefore I will give a couple of scenes that I like but I won't give too much detail. That said I will only tell you about scenes from the beginning to the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes of the first half of the movie is when young James T. Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) is driving his step-father's (?) vintage automobile, basically joy riding, when he is about 12 years old. The step-father calls on the in-dash phone and starts yelling at James to return the car, James hangs up. A police officer (robot?) gives chase and tries to pull James over, James takes a side road. The road he is on now ends at a deep ravine. James turns the steering wheel to the left, opens the driver's door and leaps from the car. The car falls over the edge into the ravine, but James is safe and as he stands the robo-cop asks his name. The way James answers is pretty funny as he says his name with dignity, and a little haughtiness.<br/><br/>The next scene I liked was when James meets Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Bones (Karl Urban). James meets Uhura in a bar. Some Star Fleet cadets intercede in his attempt to get to know her better, yeah like that would have happened, by starting a fight with James. James was able to handle himself pretty well, at the beginning, but eventually the six on one odds caught up to him. He is saved from a severe (severer?) beating by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Captain Pike offers James the opportunity to join Star Fleet, but the offer is refused. Thinking it over James joins Star Fleet. When he joins the other cadets on the transport ship he sits next to Bones and they strike up a quick friendship.<br/><br/>The third scene I like is the one in which James beats the Kobayashi Maru. The Kobayashi Maru is a un-winnable test in which the crew of a star ship has to rescue the crew of another, but there are several enemy ships surrounding the crippled ship. James has taken this test twice before but he has gained an advantage... he cheated by reprogramming the test. James wins, but he is brought up on charges of cheating and breaking the honor code of Star Fleet. James asks to face his accuser, Spock (Zachary Quinto) comes to the front of the auditorium. The scene ends not long after this, but I still like it. It's also two scenes.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. The graphics are beyond phenomenal. The plot and script was great. As I said before, J.J. Abrams was able to breath new life into this franchise. Also, it doesn't hurt that Leonard Nimoy had more than just a simple cameo role as Spock Prime."
"kalgo-725-870078","9","1","1","14 July 2013"," What a Reboot!
","I really liked this movie, it is well done, and I like the story. One thing that I don't understand is why they created the comic ""Countdown"" and did not figure out a way to communicate to watchers of this movie that it was important to see Countdown? For instance, without Countdown, why is Nero so upset at Spock Prime? Spock didn't blow up Romulus,and he tried to help. Countdown explains that. And even though it is from the future, it just makes no sense that a Romulan mining ship is so monstrously big and immensely powerful. Now, moving on, let me continue with what I didn't like in list form: If you are going to attempt to pay homages to the original material, you really should get it right, or don't do it at all! Spock Prime and Kirk are abandoned on an ice planet called Delta Vega, so close to Vulcan that you can see Vulcan's destruction with the naked eye, a fact that on its own defies reality. The first time we hear of Delta Vega is in the original series, and there is simply NO WAY that it is close to Vulcan! My next complaint is in the battle at the end. I didn't mind the first time I watched this movie, but now that I have watched the sequel, it is becoming obvious that Abrams has no idea how to stage a starship space battle. It's just a quick, mindless, ""fire everything we got!"" with no strategy, no pacing, and no evidence that Kirk is a budding military tactician of historical renown. Next, when the three jumpers are diving for the drill platform, we lose one because of his reckless maneuver. We are to believe that this wild Australian adrenalin junkie is more interested in the thrill than saving billions of lives in a military, special-ops setting? No, I don't think so. It was OK to have him fail, we would have gladly bought that, but to have him fail trying a stupid stunt, as if the jump alone wasn't thrill enough? It already is super risky, need not add that silliness. The Star Wars-esq ""one larger monster after another killing each other so it can be the one to chase the human"" on Delta Vega is childish, and doesn't work in Star Wars, don't bring it here in my house! lol Using Beasty Boys music and trashing an antique car(hundreds of years old) seems too much, and out of place. It seems highly unlikely that a starship captain would jettison an officer in a pod on an ice planet, so you had that contrived plot thing going on resulting in too many coincidences, ie, meeting Spock Prime and Scotty. Then to make Scotty the one who ""invented"" warp speed transport, nope, I don't buy it. It would more likely be Spock who would do such a thing. (In fact, didn't Spock Prime simply pull up the equation without Scotty's assistance? (Why do we need Scotty then?) But I guess Abrams is expanding the capabilities of the crew, like he did with the others. The whole scene was silly when Scotty beamed aboard the Enterprise in coolant. I liked that the mistake was made, but it was just handled so silly-I guess the coolant aboard a starship in the future is simply harmless drinking water? Really? and at a reasonable temperature for humans to swim in? And there is a button to open up a door to release the trapped person just ahead of the blender? And it stays open and doesn't completely flood engineering? Good heavens! I don't like that the engine room is a brewery, not futuristic looking. I don't like how Sulu couldn't figure out how to start the ship, it felt like a contrivance. I don't like the notion that we are now in an alternate time line. Aren't there plenty of adventures that this crew can have in our time line? Are we going to replay past adventures? (wink,wink) Does this give them license to not follow accepted Trek lure? Laziness? Now to things I liked: I really loved everything to do with Vulcan and Spock's time there. I really like Pike. I liked the start of the movie with the starship dealing with Nero. The visuals of the ships, the firing of weapons, the equipment and space sound effects were so good as to bring tears to my eyes. This movie has the finest space ship visuals of any movie ever made! I love the look of the new ship. I like the music and think that Abrams projects, like this and ""Lost"" and others show a brilliant use of music to convey somber mood. I like the characters, and their expanded capabilities, with the exception of the aforementioned Scotty and that transport formula thing. I like the casting. I like the writing, for the most part. I like the pacing, and how the movie does a very nice job of taking itself seriously, but not too seriously, compared to the first Star Trek movie, ""The Motion Picture"", which, I think, is guilty of taking itself too seriously, though, I do love that movie. lol I think that finally having a proper budget has resulted in the making of a Trek movie that shows its potential, looks expensive, is more exciting, and has wider appeal. Bravo!"

","I had no interest in Star Trek before or after I watched this movie. The reason why I decided to watch this movie was because of the release of the sequel(I believe) of this movie called ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" I heard people saying it is a great movie and I should watch it so I decided to watch the ""Star Trek: The beginning"" before I watch its sequel. I have never seen any Star Trek related series whether it was on TV or Theater and I didn't have that much expectation when I borrowed DVD to watch Star Treck the Beginning. Nonetheless, I have to say it was great decision to view this film. It has a great and easy story line that anyone who doesn't have a knowledge about the Star Trek could understand and beautiful scenes and computer graphics which satisfied my taste. Now I'm pretty excited to go watch the sequel of this movie and despite of the fact that I don't consider myself to become a fan of the series, however, I think it is still a great movie to watch whether you are a fan or not of the series."

I can't tell you how much this movie meant to some of the people there.<br/><br/>I'm somewhat an avid fan of star trek and from what i have seen this movie keeps to the original cannon.

","Quick spoiler-free review-- I had a difficult time catching my breath for a lot of the film--it IS a thrill-ride. It is a far less elegant Trek than that which I have known up to this point, and it has a very organic feel to it. The tag line of it not being your father's star trek is VERY true. Lots of people will find lots of reasons not to like the film, but I found myself very excited at the idea of getting to know these characters all over again . . . what a thought--how fun will it be to see new situations and interactions. The characters are definitely the characters and are very familiar in comfortable ways. They are also different, and for me at least, the differences work just fine.<br/><br/>The effects are stunning. The music is stirring. It is good to see good writing back in Trek again. There are some plot contrivances that are pushing the envelope of suspension of disbelief, but they work to the audience's advantage and help to get our characters in their places so much faster so we can see the story. Overall, the film was a kick! Will everyone like it? that is not possible, but I wouldn't be surprised if lots and lots and lots and lots of folks really do like it. for me: 8 out of a possible 10."
"andrewsoudbash","8","7","18","22 January 2020"," i am giving this film a nod of approval as it has done what it set out to do, reintrist the younger generations into loving a timeless story with relatable characters.
","I want to start by uploading the directors, reviving a story that many adults like my parents and grandparents remembered when they were younger as the child of a baby boomer my parents grow up watching the adventures of kirk and Spock. Like my parents when I was young we watched the original Star Trek as well. This new movie has perfectly captured the wonder and adventure of kids and adults alike once again. This film after watching a few times you start seeing scenes that didn't need to be there. If you don't understand what I mean by this, ill elaborate. You will be watching and towards the middle of the original crew will start entering the scenes and your realize there taking a really long time to gather everyone only after each new crew member there's a scene that is almost completely pointless almost like the director needed to extend the run time so they through some jokes and poor attempts at gags to amuses the viewer to diloud the long intermissions between the story and the characters. I would like to point out and continue the last idea that they wasted time in the story for run time. In the beginning few minutes we are immediately introduced to the antagonist and a tragedy starts this entire scene was a waste of time for the viewer in something that could have been explained in 2 minutes by a side character, but alas we are given almost 10 minute of a wasted scene.
World immersion is something many writers and producers have trouble getting their audience into; however, in the film we are immediately given key examples showing how people join star fleet and if you are like me, a mega lover of star trek, you would know the details of how people enlisted, and from what I could find this was almost everything was perfect, even including other alien races into the academy just to further immerse the viewer. J J abroms had spent his time creating characters that you would remember even if they were only on screen for a minute. Once the film really got started you almost felt like you were one of the crew members, rathers then feeling like a Q forced to observe for all of time. The viewer would feel like he was part of the crew and you where really with Kirk and Spock on one of there classic missions to explore the cosmos.
I will finnish by giving this film a nod of approval as it has done what it set out to do, reintrist the younger generations into loving a timeless story with relatable characters. With new TV series on the way; like Star Trek Discovery session 3 and the new star Trek Picard and the production of a new movie, we can expect to see the Star Trek franchise to continue and grow for many generations to come."
"DVDZombie","10","7","18","19 May 2009"," I am stunned, no pun intended.
","When I heard about the making of this film I cringed, when it went into production and the cast was announced I winced, when it finally hit theaters I hid. I stayed hidden and held my breath in angst waiting to hear what others thought of the movie before I dared see it myself. Even my girlfriend saw the movie before I did. All of this was due to my die hard love of not only Star Trek as a whole, but the original series more then any other. To me the characters, story lines and ideals sit so high on a pedestal they can never be tarnished and god help anything or anyone that dares touch them.<br/><br/>So I finally worked up the nerve, after reading countless positive reviews and getting the all clear from my girlfriend and two others, to see this new incarnation of Star Trek. I simply smiled, from start to finish. I cannot come up with a single complaint about this movie, it's portrayal of the Star Trek universe or the characters there in. Pine is fantastic as Kirk. I read an interview with him in which he stated that he didn't study Shatner at all because he was afraid he would try to act like him and the performance wouldn't be honest. If that is indeed true, then the casting of Pine as Kirk was the greatest casting success in history. He looks, acts and talks like William Shatner did in his portrayal of the character. At one point during the film, as Kirk is walking down the steps of Starfleet Academy with Bones, Pine does a light jog with his arms slightly raised at his sides. In that moment I could have sworn I was watching a young William Shatner portray the character. There are many other moments in the movie where the same feeling takes over and it's a wonderful thing. In my eye's Chris Pine was and is the perfect choice to play James T. Kirk and I hope that he will continue to fill the role in any sequels to come. As for the character of Kirk in the movie, it is written perfectly. Kirk was always said to be impetuous in his youth. Brash and hard headed taking on every challenge with no doubt of winning and no fear of failure. As a Captain he always chose to put his life at stake whenever the lives of others hung in the balance. Kirk always put his ship and the lives of his crew before himself and he always chose to jump in feet first when danger arose. I don't know how the portrayal of Kirk in this film could have been any more accurate then it is.<br/><br/>The movie itself pays great attention to detail where the Star Trek saga is concerned, while setting the groundwork for a whole new era. There are plenty of moments which reference the original series and stick to the time line and events of Star Trek. The mention of Scotty and his loss of Archers prize Beagle, Kirks rigging of the Kobayashi Maru test, even Chekov's infamous inability to pronounce the letter V. It's all there plus a whole lot more and even better, it's there with a twist that allows the reshaping of Star Trek's future.<br/><br/>As for the other performances, Quinto is fantastic. I doubt anyone could have chosen a better Mr. Spock. Simon Pegg is so perfect as Scotty that all I can say is watch the movie and see for yourself. He portray's the wit, charm and intelligence of Mr. Scott to a T. James Doohan would have have been proud of Pegg's performance. Urban is an excellent Doctor McCoy, Cho a wonderful Sulu and Yelchin filled the role of Chekov quite well. Zol Saldana played Uhura magnificently and I loved the way her character was handled. A beautiful actress portrayed her with just the right amount of sophistication and emotion mixed with sex appeal. What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic, the music is excellent, the wardrobe and weaponry are all perfect. The story is enthralling and contains just the right amount of humor, drama and action all rolled together into a movie that no one will soon forget. This looks and feels like Star Trek and In fact it screams Star Trek while opening up the Trek universe to a future that's never been brighter.<br/><br/>I would jump on board with the complaint of there being no role for William Shatner in this movie, but having seen it, I don't know where an old Kirk could have fit into the story. It would have made no sense to see an old Kirk given the events of Star Trek Generations and the time line presented in this movie. However, stick with me here, given the events of this film there is now room for an old Kirk to appear somewhere in a sequel. <br/><br/>To anyone who detracts from this movie I say your not being honest with yourself and, no pun intended here either, your letting your emotions cloud your judgment. Channel your inner Vulcan, or simply suck it up as the saying goes, and admit that this in one hell of a movie. To those who haven't yet seen it, go check it out because there is nothing here that a Star Trek fan or a SciFi fan in general wouldn't love. Star Trek has been done justice with this movie and more than that, both Gene Roddenberry's memory and his dream have been honored."

","I have been a Fan of Star Trek for most of my life. I admit I had SEVERE trepidation about this movie. After the first 10 minutes into what may have been THE most intense action scene ever in Star Trek my fears were put aside. J.J. Abrams vision of Star Trek was not only refreshing but nothing short of brilliant. Even half way through the film I kept thinking ""what the heck...that never happened."" but after a fateful meeting between young Kirk and old Spock everything is explained and this version of Trek is given a new life. Zach Quintano as Spock was brilliant casting, his performance was excellent. Chris Pine as James T Kirk brought a new level of both cockiness and arrogance that made his portrayal of the famed captain fresh. Karl Urban as McCoy was amazing as was Simon Pegg as Scotty. The best part about this whole movie is that it didn't focus on the usual triumvirate of Kirk,Spock and McCoy. All the members of the crew had involvement in the story and actually had something to do that was so natural they seemed to be playing these characters all along. The action scenes were intense, the special effects were amazing and the sound was incredible. Just a minor note my wife and my daughter , neither of whom are Trek fans in any sense, both wanted to see this. After seeing this movie we are all ready to line up again. I truly hope that they will announce a sequel to this film and carry on with the ongoing mission. Trek is back and in excellent hands... Thank Mr Abrams"
"WriterDave","7","7","18","10 May 2009"," Damn it, Jim, I'm a TV Producer not a Film Director!
","TV guru extraordinaire J. J. Abrams beams up as producer and director of this zippy and serviceable relaunch of the moribund ""Star Trek"" film series, itself a spin-off Gene Roddenberry's iconic 1960's sci-fi drama. There's plenty of circularity in concept and execution as Abrams does an adequate job of paying homage to the original TV series while giving everything a big epic, slick, modern film veneer. Abrams displays his usual flippant emo-sensibilities (lest we not forget his first claim to fame was the insufferable TV show ""Felicity"") in creating a colorful back-story to familiar characters, but he wisely focuses on action for the better parts of the film and keeps the pacing at warp speed even though we really know he just wants to play with Trekkies' emotions, much in the same way a swaggering Kirk antagonizes the desperately logical Spock.<br/><br/>Though Zachary Quinto is fairly lifeless as Spock, the rest of the cast is up to task doing fine impersonations of the senior Trek crew. Simon Pegg gets plenty of laughs as Scotty, and Karl Urban is mockingly masterful in his delivery of all the classic Doc McCoy witticisms. As the young Kirk, Chris Pine puts an entertaining spin on the role as he seems to be channeling both Christian Slater doing Jack Nicholson and, well, Chris Pine doing William Shatner. But it's only the dashingly smart and sexy Zoe Saldana who takes things to a new level giving Uhura a personality and vibrancy that was never apparent in the original film series.<br/><br/>Comparing the film to others in the series, it probably ranks somewhere in the middle. By far it displays the best production values and special effects of any Trek before it on the big or small screen. Always crucial to the film series, the villain in this one (a tattooed Romulan named Nero played by Eric Bana) is clearly no match for the mythic-sized Khan of said ""Wrath of"" or the unstoppable Borg Queen of the Next Generation's ""First Contact"". And while the early years of Kirk, Spock and the U. S. Enterprise are fairly well played here, the main storyline is where the film really suffers as it mashes up a big old mess of a plot involving black holes, time travel and planetary annihilation.<br/><br/>While I grew up watching the ""Next Generation"" on TV and enjoyed the original film series, I'm by no means a Trek purist. I am, however, a stickler for good storytelling. By playing with all this time-travel mumbo-jumbo, the screenwriters have essentially wiped the slate clean and negated the entire original series. The same old characters are now free to roam outer space on brand new missions, which is a brilliant business building ploy but lazy writing and a big cop-out. By going backwards in the serial mythos instead of forging ahead further into the future, the filmmakers have backed themselves into a corner. Just how many of these new adventures can the old crew have? And will it all lead to the inevitable...Picard's Academy Days or the origins of Data? While this new film was modestly entertaining and better than your average sci-fi flick, it didn't really leave me clamoring for more. Will the filmmakers eventually ""make it so""? Quite frankly, I'm indifferent, though Abrams probably ""gave it all she's got""."
"imdb-9000","10","7","18","7 May 2009"," Get over yourself Trekkers / Trekkies
","I went to see the new Star Trek movie today with a completely open mind, expecting radical changes, if not a total reboot of this iconic space opera. To be honest, I was blown away by the visual feast presented to us by Mr Abrams & co, and also the total respect shown for this iconic franchise. I don't class myself as an avid fan, just someone who's enjoyed Trek in it's many forms over the years. On my return home, I immediately read the user reviews on IMDb and my feelings echoed many of the very positive reviews on this site. There are however, a few hard core trekkies / trekkers who need to get over themselves. Trek had become very tired under the stewardship of Rick Berman and many of the actors were well past their prime. There was little point in continuing the movie franchise based on any of the previous Trek series with the respective actors. Even the TNG cast seem to be getting on a bit now! What we have here is a fresh vibrant take on classic Trek, with broad appeal for a 21st Century audience. Some of the comments are very negative about this new film, as it does not relate to the gospel of Roddenberry or follow the Star Trek canon. We have to be realistic - Hollywood is not going to produce the type of cerebral Trek, this small hardcore community hanker after. Star Trek 2009 may have a few plot shortcomings, but the excellent cast, fast paced action, stunning visuals and fresh feel of this new film certainly left me eager for a second helping, even if I was a little shocked at how old Leonard Nimoy looked! Bring on Star Trek 2!"
"musica1","10","7","18","3 May 2009"," Loved, loved, loved this Star Trek movie!!
","This movie couldn't have been any more perfect. I seriously can't think of anything I would have changed. The writing was GREAT! The casting was perfect. Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg are amazing! And Karl Urban as McCoy is priceless. Eric Bana made a very convincing villain. The directing was excellent! This movie is what the new Star Wars movies should have been and weren't. From scene one, you're captivated in by the characters (read this, George Lucas: the characters were actually DEVELOPED!), the visuals and the action. All three of those things need to be there for a good sci-fi movie or it won't satisfy. And this one satisfies in a big way.<br/><br/>I'm trying not to give spoilers here, so I can't say exactly what happened. But the writers and JJ have created a story line that will keep you immersed in the movie from scene one to the last scene. I LOVED that the central theme was the developing relationship between Kirk and Spock. I'm very familiar with the Trek universe, so I really enjoyed that they put in little shout-outs all over the place to us fans. ""I'm giving her all she's got!"" ""I'm a doctor, Jim, not a physicist!"" LOL But at the same time, they made a movie that non-fans can enjoy as well. My 20-year-old daughter went with me. She's hasn't really watched any of the Star Trek series except maybe an odd episode or two caught on TV, but she loved the movie as well.<br/><br/>And can I say that if the role of Sylar on Heroes isn't making Zachary Quinto an actual Hollywood star, his turn as Spock in this movie should do it. His Spock really makes the movie. He completely captures Spock's battle over his human, emotional side and his vulcan, non-emotional side with every little slight change of expression. <br/><br/>This may not be your father's Star Trek (as their ad said), but father, son, mother and daughter will all enjoy this one!"
"jedi_knight900","6","31","114","7 May 2009"," WARNING: Overdose on Lens Flaring and Droning Soundtrack
","Good Grief! Why the overuse of lens flaring? We get that this movie is an attempt to be a reboot for the masses and that you have to upgrade your stylistic approaches to film making and such to catch the attention of ""tweens"" and the like...but jeez, almost half the film consisted of this technique which made me feel nauseous 3 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>Mind you, this technique can be masterfully executed if used correctly (example: Very end of The Dark Knight with the lens flare as the bike drives off into the darkness).<br/><br/>Soundtrack in my opinion was very uninspired and the same dramatic theme was overplayed through several of the movies jarring scenes. Although not expecting much from the movie, I was hoping to here the epic Jerry Goldsmith theme thunder through the film at some point (was that expecting too much?), but sadly it was given a whimper at the end.<br/><br/>The ending BTW felt tacked on as an attempt to appease loyal Star Trek fans...I just didn't buy it. As one reviewer mentioned, it definitely felt like watching ""OC"" or ""90210"" Space Opera at times.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm not hating on this film. Picture a ride at Disney World which throws a bunch of action scenarios at you as you proceed through the ride. It's a lot of fun as you go through and you may remember some good parts, but the experience itself as a whole is forgettable (well, not as forgettable as this film, as there are some excellent rides at Disney World :). Some great FX, funny scenes and character interactions make this a movie worthwhile seeing in the movies at least once...Enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Star Trek rates a 6.5/10."
"rbr-80732","1","6","15","24 September 2017"," J J Abrams is a hack
","People often talk about Hollywood hacks and how the hacks are all about cash, money and balance sheet and never about a script, character development, script or (dog forbid) art.<br/><br/>But who are those hacks? Famous ones are the Pau; 'Mr embarrassment' who recently destroyed Ghostbusters or Michael Bay whose largest talent is recruiting corporations for product placement and of course JJ Abrams the douche destroyer of Star Wars (which has earned him the title Jar Jar Abrams), the copycat plagiarist of Spielberg and of course the one taking Star Trek to the level of a juvenile comic book here.<br/><br/>How this useless Hollywood hack gets assignments is probably due to his having photos of important Hollywood bigwigs. There is no other explanation.<br/><br/>Literally any Star trek episode from any period has better pacing, logic and dignity than this.

","Trekkie purists the world over will probably be trying to fathom out where this fits into their tidy little space time line for some time to come but, what the hell, it was the best two hour romp through space I've had in a long time!! Resurrecting such an icon of TV and cinema and taking it back to its very beginnings was never going to be an easy task but hats have to come off to this cast and crew, they have done a magnificent job.<br/><br/>Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were outstanding, each slotting into their role and maintaining many of the mannerisms of their predecessors. Karl Urban opened my eyes with his almost faultless recreation of DeForest Kelley's 'Bones' McCoy. Simon Pegg gave us a new, but highly enjoyable, take on Chief Engineer 'Scotty' and the rest of the core crew were equally magnificent (Including Chekov who was way out of his time line.) The inclusion of a Spock from the future, played (as excellently as ever) by Leonard Nimoy, was an interesting twist, as was the concurrent Spock's romantic involvement with Lt. Uhura. Getting Mrs Roddenbery's buy in by giving back her old job as a computer voice was a master stroke as well. From the other end, Eric Bana gave a very creditable performance as the Romulan 'Baddie', Nero.<br/><br/>What is clear is that this has been split off as a separate time line from The Original Series so certain discrepancies, not least Captain Pike's, can be quietly ignored.<br/><br/>So, did I enjoy it? Absolutely!!! Would I like to see a run of these films? Bring 'em on!!! Maybe they could even take one or two of the original story lines and bring them up to date their own way."

","I'm a lifelong Star Trek fan. I grew up in the early 80s watching the adventures of Captain Kirk, Spock, Bones - Star Trek (and Captain Future) made me a true science fiction fan. Then came THE NEXT GENERATION which I even love more. My favorite series is DS9.<br/><br/>And now, after a few years, and after the failure of ENTERPRISE, the terrible (and boring) ST: NEMESIS I thought ""this is the end of STAR TREK. Time to bury the franchise."" I would never have thought that someone would be able to reanimate this over 40 year old universe, but they did it! This is the Star Trek I always dreamed of. Full of good action, emotion, fun. In the last years (as much as I loved TNG)it was getting worse and worse).<br/><br/>And before some hardcore TOS or TNG fans say I am just for the action: Among my all time favorite episodes are TNG's THE INNER LIGHT, DS9's FAR BEYOND THE STARS and the feature THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. But such episodes worked for TV (I hope TV would be that good nowadays - I don't watch TV since many years now) For the big screen I want action, drama and emotions. This new Star Trek has all of this - and it is good!"
"Quinoa1984","8","8","22","7 May 2009"," The New/Alternate Generation
","JJ Abrams is a smart director - at the least smart enough to know what makes the original Star Trek show from the 60s, as well as the movies at their best (see Wrath of Khan thru Voyage Home), appeal so strongly to everyone from hardcore trekkies to just your average TV or movie-going public at large. It's a good script. Smart, actually, enough to try and give some new ideas or at least give us some characters to give a damn about. In his revised version of Star Trek he starts at the beginning, only an alternate beginning: it's still Kirk, Spock, ""Bones"" McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and (for a little while) Scotty, but there's some slight changes, alterations in the lineage thanks to a meddlesome, incredibly ticked-off Romulan.<br/><br/>In this case Abrams and the writers, Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann, get to have their cake and eat it in terms of story and character development; they can reboot a franchise right from the start but with some extra surprises. And because it treats time travel with a fresh perspective - you may be confused at first as to why Spock appears not only as his young self played by Zachary Quinto AND as the (formerly) one-and-only played by Leonard Nimoy - there's no limit to what can occur in a franchise that is only beholden to the original in terms of staying true to the characters, their methods and personalities, and the essential things that make Trek what it is with its ships, the federation, Klingons and Romulans, Vulcan, everything. It's a truly inspired screenplay written by people who love the show, and want to get right to the heart of the big behemoth to see what makes it tick.<br/><br/>If there are any complaints they're mostly minor, in terms of technical things. Abrams, who's only previous film was the third Mission: Impossible feature, isn't always assured during the fight scenes and cuts around a little too fast and jagged to always take. There's also a pet-peeve that one can have with lens flare (you may know what it is, in layman's terms it's that blue and other colored light that comes in horizontal lines, of which in this film I lost count), which became I assume an artistic choice as opposed to a flaw, one that didn't serve the movie really well. And while it's definitely a step up for Abrams in getting top-notch performances, especially from young actors who are definitely getting their biggest breaks yet here (albeit some are already stars and character actors, some unknown by me), there's a treatment to the direction in the movement of it that is somewhat akin to TV. Sometimes this is not a bad thing in the slightest; whenever scenes out in space were shown, in big battles or otherwise, it was fantastic, spectacular footage, by far the best in the entire franchise. As for ""dutch"" angles and rapid-fire camera movements...<br/><br/>But I digress, what most people will be concerned to know is: are these new kids the real deal? Do they fill in the shoes of iconic pop-culture figures like James T. Kirk and Spock and everyone else on the Enterprise? Without a doubt, they all rise to the challenge. Chris Pine is Kirk without having to submit to a Shatner imitation (save, arguably, for a couple of scenes like when he hits on girls or is doing the Kobayashi Maru test), and he makes Kirk his own through and through; he makes me thoroughly excited to see where he'll go in this rebooted series. Ditto for Quinto, who brings his own calm and intensity to a Spock that needs to rise up to meet his elder form right in front of him at one point. Others like Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, (of course) Simon Pegg and John Cho, they're all a pleasure to see not taking over roles as imitations, but just being themselves as the characters.<br/><br/>So, Star Trek, this revised edition is up to the standards of a franchise that can concern itself with action and suspense and adventure, but is also as much character driven as it is with story. No matter what quibbles I might have with certain aesthetic choices, this is the best we've seen from this diluted and over-exposed franchise (I mean Trek in general, through all of its re-incarnations of Next Gen and Deep Space 9) since its previous hey-day in the 1980s. It's fresh, exciting, funny, and has smart action to go with its package."

You can imagine my low expectations when I was pressured into seeing this movie. I really don't know how J.J. Abrams did it, but I left with - at the very least - an appreciation of star trek. Even in flashbacks of Kirk's childhood, the kid who played him was a splendid actor (and I normally HATE child actors). I would definitely recommend it to my friends...

"Critomaton","8","5","12","13 May 2009"," Finally! A remake/reboot/re-imagining/re-whatever gets it right!
","Star Trek is fantastic. It works on multiple levels. First, the characterizations are very faithful to the personality traits we've associated with Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, and the rest of the crew for the last 40 years. And yet, at the same time, the actors breathe new life and vitality into the roles. There's a fair amount of action, and lots of humor - fast-paced, clever humor, not just throwaway lines. <br/><br/>While watching this movie, I was enjoying it so much I started to wonder - would it be as entertaining if this was the first time we met these characters, or is part of the charm seeing such a believable ""origins story""? I really couldn't decide, the movie did such a seamless job of updating - yet staying true to - the Star Trek story.<br/><br/>OK, so yeah, the plot is a little confusing, because of the time travel aspect. But it wasn't nearly as bad as the Lost In Space remake in that regard. And yes, the ""loner out for revenge""-type villain may not provide many opportunities for grand philosophizing, but somehow the movie still seemed like it had a lot of depth. And for some reason, I actually thought this was one of Eric Bana's better roles. <br/><br/>I knew this movie would be good when most of the bad reviews on IMDb seemed to be from Trekkers who are upset about damage to the space-time continuum, or problems with parallel universes, or the look of the control panels, or other stuff that would normally be reserved for a line of dialogue from Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons. <br/><br/>Here's just one example of something the movie did right... I always hated that part from Star Trek II where Kirk was all smug about how he changed the Kobayashi Maru scenario so he could win. It seemed like such a stupid thing to be proud of - but I have to admit it was a quintessential Kirk (and Shatner) moment. <br/><br/>And when this movie began to elaborate on that event with young Kirk hamming it up during the fake crisis, I thought ""Oh man, I don't like where this is going"" - I began to sense shades of Superman Returns, with scene after classic scene being simultaneously rehashed and stripped of its soul. But no sooner did I have this thought then - BAM! - it turns out to be a setup for a very dramatic confrontation between Kirk and Spock that sets up their dynamic for the rest of the movie - not to mention the last 40 years. <br/><br/>Somehow, J.J. Abrams really did achieve time travel with this movie. He propelled Star Trek into the future by fully honoring its past. Bryan Singer (Superman Returns), Tim Burton (Willy Wonka), Michael Bay (Friday the 13th), Peter Jackson (King Kong), and all those other directors who have been destroying the classics for the last decade or so should take note. <br/><br/>Christopher Reeve IS Superman and always will be. Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka and always will be. Whoever that first guy in King Kong was always will be and Jack Black WON'T. But it really feels like we have a new Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Chekov, and Sulu. There is no question that Zachary Quinto IS the new Spock. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if this flick will warrant as many multiple views as Iron Man (that suit and Robert Downey, Jr. are just too cool), but I have this nagging feeling that Star Trek is actually the better movie."
"barryjaylevine","9","5","12","12 May 2009"," Completely entertaining; a great afternoon at the movies!
","This is a perfect example of movie-making as a team effort. Everyone brought something special to the party, worked their behinds off, and went home exhausted from all the effort. JJ Abrams and the rest of the cast and crew can be proud of what they've accomplished here.<br/><br/>I remember watching Star Trek on NBC as a teenager during the show's original seasons. As I grew older, however, the Kirk/Spock/etc reruns and movies grew somewhat boring (except ST-IV, ""Save the Whales"").<br/><br/>The Next Generation show was wonderful as it finally decided to take itself a bit more seriously and had story lines that were more adult. However, with the exception of ""First Contact"", these ""TNG"" movies weren't very good.<br/><br/>But now along comes JJ Abrams and tries to do what was supposed to be impossible: Resurrect the Star Trek franchise.<br/><br/>You know what? He's done it. I brought my son along (who was born when TNG first aired on TV). We had a wonderful time. The actors who inhabit Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Chechov, etc. bring just enough of the old '60's Star Trek along for the ride yet are confident enough to put their own imprint on these cultural icons (and the director is confident enough to let them). The interaction among the characters was a hoot. This builds the characters anew yet, because of some deft direction and crisp writing, lets us older fans feel comfortable.<br/><br/>What about the plot? From beginning to end, it's pretty much a non-stop roller-coaster ride. Suspend your sense of disbelief (it's Sci-Fi, remember?) and simply go with the flow. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Perhaps we'll have time in future Star Trek films to really flesh out the rest of the cast. I look forward to them.<br/><br/>I have -no- complaints about this re-boot of Star Trek. See it on the big screen and sit so the screen fills your entire field of vision. This is Hollywood at its best."

I tried to watch Lost, but it didn't move me, then JJ came along with 6 degrees which was a departure from his Sci-Fi roots and it was an incredible show that was cut far to soon from the ABC schedule.<br/><br/>I was not impressed with Mission Impossible 3 and didn't even consider spending a penny on Cloverfield. Fringe is amazing TV and possibly the best Sci Fi on TV since X-Files.<br/><br/>It's because JJ and his Fringe staff stepped up to the plate here that I spent my dollar. This movie was amazing. Short of an early sequence of a 10 year old Kirk, I enjoyed the film. I think the actors paid an amazing homage to the original stars and JJ and writers managed to bring a great amount of conflict, struggle and drama to the screen while maintaining the comedy and action from the best of this series.<br/><br/>This film has turns you never see coming and manages to bring you up to date on characters in a single film. This is not your fathers or grandfathers Trek, but that's a good thing. Much like Dark Knight, they finally got it right. I'm not a Treker, Trekie or anything to that account. Just a guy who loves movies and I can say well done indeed."
"BMatth6167","9","5","12","11 May 2009"," A few thoughts that are being overlooked...
","I have to say this right up front: I liked the movie. I did. Really, I did. But as the film is being hailed by innumerable online voices as the finest version of Star Trek ever created at anytime, anywhere, by anyone, please allow me to toss in a few grousing points.<br/><br/>J.J.Abrams version of Starfleet is the most unprofessional exploration and peacekeeping force in the cinematic galaxy. Totally unprofessional. It's being run by kids. Not just any kids, but kids fresh out of the academy. In J.J.'s Starfleet, you can go from being an academically suspended Starfleet cadet, without rank or actual space-faring experience, and within a single action-packed week be promoted to the rank of Captain (one rank step below an Admiral, mind you) and given command of a starship. And not just any starship....THE FLAG SHIP OF THE FLEET. The ship that professional career officers work their entire careers to get assigned to. If I'd been such an officer on the Enterprise and found out my new captain was a kid just out of the Academy who cheated on his exams and got his job by being brash, cocky, good looking and the son of another career officer who died on the job, I'd resign my commission. Clearly, Starfleet has a different set of priorities than when I signed up.<br/><br/>Another sign of the unprofessionalism: two of the bridge officers, the top people aboard the ship, officers so good that their daily assignment is to the decision making ""brain"" of the ship, are openly seen making out on the transporter pad prior to an away mission. Professional people do not do things like that. Professional people get fired for doing things like that. Not so in J.J.'s Starfleet, because J.J.'s Starfleet is run by kids. It has kid priorities. Kid rules. Kid thinking behind it's decision making.<br/><br/>I realize the whole point of the movie was to bring Star Trek to a new generation of kids, to create new Star Trek fans where there were few before. But I just wish we didn't have to change things to the point of pandering in order to create those new fans. I wish we hadn't gone quite so far to reach an audience that sees high achievement as a turn off....""See slackers, you can be a Starfleet officer too! No maturity or experience necessary"".<br/><br/>But, after all, it's just a movie. And I did like the movie. When it comes out on DVD, I'll buy it. When they make sequels, I'll see them too. Maybe the writers will have tightened things up around the ship by that time. I hope so. Kids need to see professionalism, too."
"eyecandyforu","6","5","12","11 May 2009"," Introductions and the flimsiest of plots
","JJ Abrams sets out to reinvent a franchise. Judging by the box office and lots of hooplah he has. Just like G.I. Joe, Superman, Spiderman and God help us Land of the Lost, everything old is new again. After a very nicely done opening pre-credit sequence we settle down to each familiar character's introductions, played by fresh young faces. There is something fun about seeing Quinto and Pine play Spock and Kirk, just setting out. We're exhausted for them already. <br/><br/>After some very fast explanations the plot kicks in. Not that a plot really matters, a fact that the writers and director obviously agreed with. Humor me for a minute and imagine if any of the original cast(s) were in this film. It would have been the biggest box office flop of the year. As a side note to directors and producers must we always have that comic bit of business at the beginning of a voyage when a spaceship behaves like a car? The driver doesn't know the controls, or it stalls. Then it's off to the really dangerous battle! This crew is wet behind the ears, so much so that they behave incompetently, then snap into genius mode. Only the recent graduates with no experience can save this world! Where is the rest of the Federation? Is everybody on vacation? Security on board the ship treat an officer like they're bullies on a playground. The voice recognition system can't identify a key member of the crew until he changes his accent. Characters wander around the bridge, more concerned with each other than the mission. And on, and on. This is all treated like a big wink to the audience, what a wacky crew. The intent being to make the audience like these characters again by making them stupidly human, like teenagers acting up inside a huge toy.<br/><br/>The Real World Trek.<br/><br/>Drastic plot devices are thrown at us with little regard for character behavior. At one point a Starfleet officer strands another officer (unconscious!!!) on a dangerous, frozen planet, for no other reason than he seemed to be getting on his nerves. That certainly is a new one. Is the ship so new that the brig isn't ready? Not to mention the fact that said stranded officer boarded the ship against orders by being infected with some sort of sickness, purposely administered by a doctor! Couldn't he just pretend to be sick?<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if I'm a Trek fan or not, in any military situation this would be absurd. This little bit of court martial material is necessary though, for other ridiculous plot lines to follow. <br/><br/>The film has an extreme deja vous aspect, with bald villains wearing Matrix like outfits speaking as though they're hanging out on the corner (""Hi""), commanding a big 'ol planet killing ship that looks like it's alive. I would invoke Star Trek Nemesis, but you already know that. Speaking of big 'ol ship, the Enterprise looks very nice, but we see very little of her. I don't recall seeing any shots of her speeding through Space, she just sort of ""blips"" from one point to another. There is no sense of space in...Space. <br/><br/>The ending rushes up before we know it, Eric Bana barely has a chance to act (and what a throw-away role, absolutely no development). I did experience several moments of fun, mainly in the slight impersonations the young actors do as a nod to the originals. The effects are fine but there were moments I would have liked to have seen what I was looking at better, or steadier. As one other astute reviewer put it, it IS the ultimate reset button film. So much so that I was lectured by a stranger in the restroom of the theater regarding the total reinvention of the franchise: ""They're starting over man, like it's a whole new Trek."" <br/><br/>I get that, but must it be such a mediocre new Trek?"
"jctundis","7","5","12","11 May 2009"," A for effort.
","Much like the first Star Trek movie, this one leaves a little to be desired. I guess the ""odd numbered curse"" lives on! The film moves at a breakneck pace at first, and then slows down significantly with the boredom alleviated with the timely arrival of Scotty, played brilliantly and with fervor by Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>Abrams made it clear that this was not a Star Trek film for Star Trek fans, and this shows most evidently in the characterization of Spock. I can't really explain without giving too much away, but from a writing standpoint... if this was to be a re-launch of all that made Star Trek great for a new generation of viewers then any future revelations about Spock or Vulcan philosophy in general have been rendered somewhat meaningless. Abrams tore away all the much discussed conflicts within the vaunted philosophy of logic, and with a bit of ""gleeful contempt"" as well.<br/><br/>The villain, Nero, is unmemorable -- as is the main plot. The only refreshing change, for good or bad, is that Starfleet makes no effort to fix things! But, of course, since Abrams and company have incorporated a much hackneyed plot device to create a ""new re-boot reality"" for Star Trek, they couldn't fix it now, could they? A quick assessment of the cast is as follows: Chris Pine plays an excellent Kirk. He's sexy, reckless and arrogant, but his presence is one of command.<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto should have been great as Spock, but his portrayal is too emotional at this early stage and it's very hard to accept him in this role. One particular relationship is also hard to believe.<br/><br/>Eric Bana's Nero is a lackluster villain and will be forgotten.<br/><br/>Although Bruce Greenwood is a bit too old for the role, he makes an adequate Christopher Pike.<br/><br/>Karl Urban is DeForest Kelly. He seems a bit out of place in a ""Star Trek movie not meant for Star Trek fans"" -- but he is an absolute joy to watch in every scene.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana as Uhura is a bit more ""stuck up"" than her predecessor, but that's to be expected, I suppose. This is the 21st century:) She's edgy, and very sexy.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg, Simon Pegg, Simon Pegg. I want a full on Scotty movie!! John Cho makes for a (finally) kick-butt Sulu! Anton Yelchin as Chekov was a little harder to accept. The accent was so forced, and felt like another case of ""gleeful contempt"" on the part of Abrams. Making fun of the accent by engaging in a hyperbolic exaggeration of it. It's only clever when you don't notice it, but the accent is omnipresent in every Chekov scene.<br/><br/>Ben Cross as Sarek was a brilliant casting move.<br/><br/>Sure, as an old Star Trek fan (I began watching it with my dad in the mid '70s, and I was named after Jeffrey Hunter and even my middle name, Christopher, was chosen because of his Pike character) I can nitpick the heck out of this movie. The science is bad (a black hole is not a wormhole), some of the continuity changes make no sense (which makes one wonder why any effort at all was made to reconcile this re-boot with the original series), etc, etc. I could go on, but it would be giving too much away.<br/><br/>But, all in all, it was a fun ride and is one of (if not the) best looking films in the franchise. A little shallow, perhaps, but that seems to be par for the course this movie season. So, maybe it played like a cheesy TV show sometimes but isn't that in the spirit of things? I definitely give it an A for effort. Something had to be done as the franchise had run dry more than a decade ago leading me to abandon the franchise (especially after the arrival of the far superior Babylon 5 series).<br/><br/>And remember. If you're going on an away mission, don't wear red!"
"KathyL59","5","5","12","10 May 2009"," Entertained and disappointed at the same time
","Okay, I have to say that I have been watching Star Trek since syndication put TOS on after school every day in the early 70's and couldn't wait to hopefully have another series start with the same characters I loved. I was excited when the movies came out and TNG started in the late 80's. Each movie and all the series that followed had the same basic theme, exploration of the universe that also explored the inner working of any society, righting wrongs and sticking to a moral and ethical code, with a little action by the bad guys thrown in. There was no moral or ethical dilemma in this movie, just a mad alien with a large ship who wanted to destroy Vulcan...shades of Star Wars! I liked this movie for the action but I just could not believe the change in the time line by a miner holding a grudge. And of all the other unbelievable things, Kirk steps into the captain's chair almost after leaving Starfleet Academy. Kirk should have been an officer for about 10 years before getting promoted to Captain. Having been in the military, no matter how competent you are, you are not going to be promoted that quickly. And Chekov was not assigned to the Enterprise for at least a year after Kirk was given the assignment. But I figure that gives Paramount at least 2 more movies to restore the time line to what it was. Here's hoping."
"andy-jennings","5","5","12","9 May 2009"," Not too bad, but not too great
","People seem pretty passionate about this movie. Honestly don't see why. The story is okay. Characters aren't bad. Still, something is missing. There's no soul in this movie. All the action scenes happen so fast you can't see anything. When someone gets punched in the face I wanna see them get hit. I wanna see their head snap back. I wanna see them crumble to the floor. I wanna see them sweat. Look frustrated.<br/><br/>What I don't want to see is a jerky camera cut away and two second later show me a guy with a bloody lip. Come on directors. Wasn't there ever a fight in your high school? Ditto for every other aspect of this movie. When a space ship is flying. Let's see it fly in open space, without a lot of crap around it, some dramatic music.<br/><br/>When characters are flirting, let them flirt.<br/><br/>To all future directors of space movies: Watch ""Pitch Black"" ""Wrath of Kahn"" ""Alien"" Season 3-5 of STNG. Ask yourselves 'why did this work.' Than watch the new Star Wars and ask 'why is this so terrible.' New Star Trek? Watch it on TV. It's better than Deep Space 9, I guess."

","Star Trek has been deconstructed and reconstructed into a new future that allows - finally - the franchise to boldly go where it has not been before.<br/><br/>For the un-trekkers: This movie is a mixture of stunning cinematography and fun ""don't take me so seriously"" plot that reboots the previous tired and dated musings of a franchise trapped in it's own zeitgeist. I'll get in trouble for saying this, but it's everything that the prequels to Star Wars wished it could have been. It's fresh, It's fun, It's visually spectacular, and a must see for anyone who likes action and adventure! If you like Star Trek, Star Wars, Star Gate, Starship Troopers, you are going to love this movie. It's just... cool! Way to go JJ!<br/><br/>For those fans who are already Trek (however you identify yourself): JJ Abrams has started a religious war. This movie is the Reformed Church of Star Trek - and I can see how many an Old School fan would see this as breaking too many rules.<br/><br/>I personally had a problem with some of the effects, especially the transporter (hated it) and I have no clue what they were intending for engineering, but it's not the engineering I know.<br/><br/>I have problems with plot holes - saw a ton of them, but hey I am a Star Trek Fan and dissect everything to the nth degree.<br/><br/>My suggestion for all fans Trek: go into this with an open mind and you will not be disappointed. For the first time in 10, no 15 years I have seen something special with the name Star Trek attached to it.<br/><br/>Watch this movie - it's amazing!"
"SoTyred","Null","5","12","8 May 2009"," My odd review: This film can only be validated by sequels.
","Star Trek 2009(SPOILERS WITHIN!!!): I'm not really going to write much, but I'll do that good/bad thing I see is so popular anymore. The easy way out. But much of the nonsense has already been rehashed in various actual reviews (those being ones that give examples rather than ""That was awesome man!!"").<br/><br/>THE BAD: Most of it. They didn't even attempt to make the whole 'time traveling thru a black hole' thing make sense. Just muttered some nonsense and moved on.<br/><br/>The bridge design IS as bad as I feared. It is absolutely the most distracting thing I've ever seen on film. I can't believe someone thought all that 'stuff for the sake of stuff' was a good idea, or in any way needed.<br/><br/>As has been stated countless times: No plot. The issue of destiny is so forced they may as well have just started the film where it ended, and just had the 'plot' as the opening 20 min sequence, and given us a real story. (more on that later).<br/><br/>Space Diving. Nuff said.<br/><br/>Scotty was handled very badly. Tho we can blame the later Trek TOS films for the 'Scotty as comic relief', this was just over the top silly.<br/><br/>As I mentioned (and feared...and this was way before Eberts review), they don't even try to make any of the physics logical. The Space Diving scene is offset by the revelation to Scotty about beaming, and ...well...like Ebert said...why didn't they beam exactly??? Oh that's right ...a dumb action scene was needed.<br/><br/>There's so much more that's already been said over and over. This is just fluff. Lotsa 'splosions, some 'tacked on' feeling drama, and little or no attempt to really achieve anything else. That's the problem. The 'real' story is that they needed a device to restart the TOS time line, but they did it badly. There are so many ways they could have achieved the same outcome (starting a fresh universe), but in a smarter way. For instance the time travel could have been handled like it was in TOS, with slingshoting around the sun. An established Trek method of time travel.<br/><br/>Nero's changing of some history makes sense, but not all. I can accept the changes to the characters lives, but not the way things are built or engineered. I'm not talking about the 'look' (as in the set from the 60's), I'm talking about matters that Nero's interference would just have no bearing on. I'm still trying to figure out how Scotty doesn't live his 'normal' existence, because nothing Nero does would have affected his life. Not that we ever knew a lot about it anyway, but still.....another dumb example of lazy and awful writing.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: I like the cast. ALL of them. Yes even Chris Pine. He had all the swagger that a Kirk character should have. Everyone was aces in my book.<br/><br/>Other than the bridge design, the rest of the overhauls to Enterprise didn't bother me a much. Altho why the design of the outside of the vessel is changed fits into the ""Well...what's that got to do with Nero altering time?"" problem. I can live with it, but there's no reason the Enterprise shouldn't have looked EXACTLY (exterior) as in TOS. Nothing Nero did would change the basic engineering concepts and design concepts.<br/><br/>Oh the FX are good as well.<br/><br/>That's it. That's the good. Which brings me to my 'topic' statement:<br/><br/>MY HOPE: They take this wonderful cast and make some Trek with some meat on the bones. No pun intended.<br/><br/>If they can give us some TOS Trek stories that are well written, by serious sci/fi writers who know how to write a more character driven drama/adventure, this film is a win, IMO. I wouldn't even mind them 'remaking' some TOS episodes and sort of doing what George Romero did when he wrote the script for the Night of the Living Dead (1991) remake: Just throw a few clever curve balls in. I wouldn't even mind straight up longer versions of classic tales. Why not? This is all about 'bringing Trek to a new generation'. Well, give them a REAL taste of what Trek was about in future installments.<br/><br/>JJ did his job, no matter who likes it or doesn't. Trek is alive again.<br/><br/>But now that the job is done, Trek needs to go back to being something of substance again. Just get real writers, and possibly a new director the next time.<br/><br/>I often hear people rip on The Final Frontier , or Insurrection. At least those films had substance. Real drama, not forced.<br/><br/>JJ's (and Orci and the other turd writers) Star Trek is like an ice cream cone that melts before you're even half way thru. If they can manage on making this a film series with stories of substance, it could work.<br/><br/>--Rating: 5/10 (My ""Worth seeing, but zero re-watchable value"" rating).--"

I am very happy that he did not try and invent the characters to what he wanted instead, he did a great job of keeping the basic personalities while adding a lot of emotion.

"The_highlander","1","5","12","7 May 2009"," A Trek film? No, but an entertaining one.
","I am a lover of trek. I watched the re-runs of the original series when I was very young, and continued with TNG and DS9. Voyager was on my short list and Enterprise annoyed me with its lack of cannon and originality so much that I couldn't enjoy it as a trek series.<br/><br/>I have been beside myself over the last few years for a decent dose of ""Star Trek"" that held the same emotions and story telling as the originals. ""Nemesis"" completely destroyed the hope I had that the feeling of the original (or even the first two spin-offs) could be rekindled.<br/><br/>When I heard of this re-imagining, I had a feeling it would be ""Nemesis"" in new clothes, that as long as the same people were at the helm (B&B) there would never be a reprise of the old trek that so many loved.<br/><br/>And I was right. The old trek is gone, and may never be back. At least, not in this new form. But this movie, this mutated form of trek does have some appeal.<br/><br/>I am no fan of eye candy just for the sake of having it, and this movie delivers more than its share. The special effects were well done, the acting well above the decent mark, and in some cases excellent. But the notion, the very idea, that this is all trek is, well, absurd at best.<br/><br/>The story is sub-par, another psycho from Romulus wants to take his revenge, and eventually finds himself trying to destroy earth. The enterprise finds a very contrived way of stopping it. In essence, this is what ""Nemesis"" should have been. They ignore several scientific facts for the benefit of spectacular (although absurd) special effects shots and leave plot holes for the sake of including bits of cannon mixed with more effects.<br/><br/>The bits of cannon included, however, does not make it a trek film. Sadly, the film deviates totally from trek in general, and instead to make it a trek film, they use the names and clichéd lines from the original series, and even one of the crew. But almost everything else deviates and twists the origins into something more Hollywood'eske.<br/><br/>The final thought is this is a very entertaining film, and most fans of the originals will appreciate all the dialog and character association from classic trek. But overall this film is lacking in the one department that made Star Trek, what it was. And that is heart."
"treadwaywrites","8","10","30","27 April 2009"," Visuals Will Leave You Stunned.
","By far Star Trek is the greatest movie adventure of all time. The story of Star Trek and its Enterprise crew should be well known by now, but in case you were hiding in a cave... The Enterprise is a starship from Earth's 25 century and the crew's mission is to seek out new life and to boldly go where no man has gone before. Way back in the day, 1966, came the Star Trek television series. Then in 1979 came Star Trek The Motion Picture. Now in 2009 we have Star Trek which follows those original characters of Captain Kirk and the Vulcan Spock, only this time we're getting a fresh new batch of actors.<br/><br/>This film allows us to explore Kirk and Spock before they have become their legendary selves. We meet James Kirk and learn how he was challenged from his home in Iowa into joining Starfleet, equivalent to our NASA today. We meet Spock who is tortured between his Vulcan heritage and his human nature and emotions. The other characters also come into our view for ""the first time"" and even though the actors faces are fresh the characters are very familiar. This is quite a challenge to the actors playing them and an equal challenge to real fans of the series who have embedded themselves and love of the characters with those original actors.<br/><br/>For Trek fans you're going to love this movie. It is fresh yet familiar. There is lots of new material here to keep you going for two hours. It is great to see this reboot of the characters and see them unfold from the beginning again. You'll love seeing Spock and Kirk save the galaxy for the first time. However, also for Trek fans the reboot isn't going to be able to follow every reference or look and act the same as it did in 1966 or 1979. When the series first rebooted itself with the 1979 release, little was thought about making everything match the t.v. series – thank god. It worked great. So hopefully Trek fans will see the choices made in 2009 as reasonable ones.<br/><br/>For normal movie goers this film is a marvel of modern CGI and everything looks so real that it is hard to believe that it is not real. It is a gorgeous looking film and that is hard to argue. J.J. Abrams, the film's director has done a remarkable job in getting this project off the ground and also pulling this movie together considering the special effects. It's almost like pulling a movie out of thin air. Just as the model making was incredible in the earlier films it is the computer imaging that makes this movie look breathtaking. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is a bit uneven and unbalanced. The actors certainly had enough reference material to pull from and while I wasn't looking for any type of impersonations from the actors, the characters are pretty much set in stone from the books and previous movies. This might be where Trek fans are most critical. From a non Trek point of view, the development could have been much deeper that it was. One of the surprise performances comes from Simon Pegg who plays Scotty, the ship's engineer. His delivery and skill takes many of the scenes that he is in.<br/><br/>As fir Chris Pine (James Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock), their chemistry together has a certain flair, but the spark never ignites fully. They play their parts very light without letting themselves go too deep into these characters. The tension of friendship is there but at times I just wasn't convinced that these guys had the bravado necessary to save the galaxy. If their chemistry doesn't do it for you, don't worry. There is still some sexiness to this geeky film. Just like its predecessors, this film finds a way to work in some sex appeal.<br/><br/>I am forced to admit that I am a Trek fan. Therefor I like the movie. I think I'm able to be unbiased enough though to say that non-Trek fans will like this movie too. It is a great sci- fi ride with some awesome graphics, great fighting, some twists and turns and all around good fun. If you're not a fan this movie just might make a fan of you."
"bob the moo","Null","7","19","29 May 2009"," Narrative-wise it has many faults but, in terms of summer blockbusters, it is accessible, fun, noisy and exciting with plenty of easy entertainment and spectacle
","Satirical news provider The Onion did a bit on their website the week this film came out with the headline that (roughly) read ""Fans slate new Trek film as 'fun' and 'accessible'"" which not only allowed them to make fun of the previous Star Trek movies but also provide a good review of the new one. The new film doesn't deliver the goods when it comes to shots of men sitting talking around tables and other such Trek film standards but in fairness it could not do more to make it clear that this is a massive ""reboot"" of the franchise that, with one thing or another, had stopped being of interest to a lot of casual viewers.<br/><br/>The better Trek films have always been the ones that have a bit of pace to them and plenty of action (2 and 6 in my opinion) but even these have slower, duller moments that come with the territory. Mostly this film strips them out and leaves little but action across the running time, making it quite a spectacle to watch and why it is one of the summer blockbusters I decided to actually pay to see at the cinema rather than catch on DVD (Wolverine – I'll catch you when I can rent you). To borrow a worn cliché – the money is all there on the screen and almost without exception it looks great and it is very easy to get caught up in the speed and scale of it all. I particularly liked some of the more imaginative shots and techniques that it used, making it much more engaging and adding a further element of freshness (which, if we're frank, the franchise badly needed). I will temper this by saying that at times there seems to be spectacle for the sake of spectacle – such as the creatures on the ice planet and the silly car scene with a child Kirk at the wheel – and this does make me sit back a bit and see it as effects rather than something I should get emotionally engaged in but this is the minority of the film.<br/><br/>Another injection is the comedy. While it is careful not to out and out mock the originals, there is much to laugh at with plenty of good lines that subvert some of the things we know from the original films (""out of the chair"" being my favourite but there are plenty others). I can see why this may be a problem for some but it does make it a lot more fun to watch than the last few Trek films. That the narrative is not as good as the action or throwaway lines is not much of a surprise but it does still niggle a little bit, specifically when it has to rely on so much coincidence to keep things moving. The sheer entertainment value of the film meant that I didn't dwell on these things but at times the way the plot plays out does suggest a little bit of contempt for the viewer. Having said that, it is a smart move to have the time travel plot that allows for the time-line of events to come to be totally changed (a point that the film labours to point out in one scene, so that everybody gets it) because this allows them to make further films that focus on action over detail without the worry of messing up some existing Trek time-line detail.<br/><br/>The cast surprised me in terms of how well they did – not least because the majority of them are not banner actors and indeed some of them I had never heard talk before (Urban's Bones is only known to me for his killer in the second Bourne film). Everyone does a sort of performance that allows us to know the character but doesn't get close enough to being an impression to be a worry. Pine fits the swaggering Kirk role really well and, although nothing here impresses me that much, he is very good as that. Likewise Quinto (Heroes) does a good job as Spock, managing better with the comedy impatience as well. Urban is as fun as Kelly ever was while Saldana makes for a very attractive Uhura (short skirt and all). Yelchin and Cho are quite fun but, as much as I like Simon Pegg, his wandering Scottish accent was so awful that it detracted from his otherwise funny performance. Both Greenwood and Bana add an older, tougher edge to the film, the latter being a particularly effective villain.<br/><br/>The new Star Trek film may upset fans because it does jettison pretty much all of the existing story in favour of starting its own as well as throwing all its weight into action and fun at the expense of almost everything else, but for the vast majority of viewers this will be the film's big selling point. Narrative-wise it has many faults but, in terms of summer blockbusters, it is accessible, fun, noisy and exciting with plenty of easy entertainment and spectacle. Great summer blockbuster."
"kitsilanoca-1","10","7","19","10 May 2009"," A Parallel Universe?
","CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Having seen the original series when it was first aired as a small child, and watched reruns on and off ever since, I went into the threatre with an open mind and came out very happy with what I had seen. I found it fun, exciting and imaginative, with great arcs in the stories of the main characters, and I obviously wasn't the only one who felt this way because the audience in the theatre I attended clapped enthusiastically at the end. <br/><br/>I have come to realize over the last forty years that with Star Trek anything can happen, including black holes behaving like worm holes, and the shift in the space-time continuum did not bother me at all, though I was surprised as anyone else at the destruction of Vulcan and the tragic death of Spock's mother. Still I accepted right away that this was opening new roads for ideas as much as Spock and Uhura being a number is, or Scotty being given the equation for trans warp beaming by a Spock from the future.<br/><br/>I truly liked getting to see a young Spock's vulnerable human side a bit more than we did in the original series. Then again in the original series episode, The Menagerie, we do see a younger Spock showing this by smiling in a certain scene, and a few other episodes have him expressing some emotions as well. I am very curious to see more of him in what I expect will be future films. I was also glad to see Ben Cross as the choice for Sarek, and found him touching as Spock's logical father who admits he has felt emotions like love.<br/><br/>So for those who aren't happy with this new look to Star Trek, I suggest you maybe try to see it as a parallel universe to the original series, where both slight and great differences can exist. Also keep in mind that just because time has been tinkered with doesn't mean the characters from STNG etc. won't exist on this time plane in the future. They just may have some changes in their lives, positive or negative, minor or extreme. Just be imaginative: maybe Jean-Luc Picard will captain the future Enterprise, he'll just have married and divorced, having fathered some children in that time. Maybe Tuvok of STVG - who'd be a child when this story is told - was not on Vulcan when it was destroyed. The same might be said for Ensign Vorek's parents, and they will meet at the Vulcan colony that the elder Spock plans to help build. Maybe Seven of Nine's family will never be assimilated by the Borg, she'll end up joining the Maquee and meet Seska, as well as Chekotay and Bh'lana, that way, and they'll all meet Captain Janeway and the USS Voyager the way the rebel group did in the series. Who can say?<br/><br/>As one film reviewer here in Vancouver said, he'd been waiting for this for forty years, and I couldn't agree more; I'm going to see it a second time!"
"anderbilt","9","7","19","8 May 2009"," The New Star Trek is a Highlight Reel
","Seeing the new Star Trek film at its opening in my local theater last night has given release to the nearly two years of tension felt since the announcement that the next film would reboot The Original Series. <br/><br/>It's a tough job; the Original Series, of all the franchises, had the tough job of competing in prime time TV in the pre-cable days of the Big Three Networks in the late 1960's. As such, it fought for audience share against cowboy, cop shows and splashy entertainment specials during its nearly three years on NBC. Trek fans of the modern era, who weren't around when Trek bloomed and faded away back then, often can't understand the steadfast attachment of the Original Trek fans to the series. I always consider it to be in a pristine bubble, where It Was What It Was, regardless of how today's fan, William Shatner or Leonard Nimoy feel about it today. It was often well-written with the craft of that day's trusted network writers, with sprinkles of brilliance from the top sci fi writers of the day; it was a trustable sci fi show, with the fun of the cop and cowboy show all rolled in as well. <br/><br/>This show, and Kubrick's 2001, were the two seachange moments of visual sci fi in that late 60's era, so give them their due. <br/><br/>To the NEW Trek: AWESOME action film. I found it a relief that the first act of the movie throws the whole universe in flux and vibrantly gives license for the substantial revision of the entire Trek universe. <br/><br/>My only complaint is a nagging subtle sense that the plot was crafted using highlights of the previous Trek moneymakers: villain seeking vengeance, time travel ex machinas, and the overall sense of ""let's make a fun space kids movie"" that crept in all the way back in ST II Wrath of Khan and really didn't leave until the TNG films. <br/><br/>Awesome production design, awesome effects, great fit and finish!! Fun!"

","If your a fan of Star Trek at all or Sci-fi in general this is not worth seeing. If you like a good action movie with an interesting plot this is not worth seeing. If you like well acted character development and a plot that at times makes no sense, and boring ""action"" scenes:<br/><br/>THIS IS YOUR MOVIE! I think Abrams took his formula from ""Lost"" and simply applied to Star Trek.<br/><br/>Honestly, as a Trek fan I could handle detail changes. Of course some of the material from a TV show 40 years ago is a little dated. But without revealing details of the movie, there is more ""Action for Action sake!"", overdone bright lighting and ""Huh? What about this detail?"" moments that critics and other reviewers seem to have overlooked or simply dismissed.<br/><br/>I also find it strange that when a director ""reimagines"" a classic (King Kong, Planet of the Apes) but is obviously a fan and stays true to the core work, he gets panned. While when Abrams ""reboots"" a classic, changes details and doesn't seem to care about Treks themes he is applauded. <br/><br/>Please JJ Abrams ""reboot"" some other film classics like ""The Godfather"".....I want Sonny Corleone to live!"
"lotharofthehillpeople420","1","4","9","2 June 2011"," Star Trek Reboot was a Deal Breaker :(
","Star Trek I should have been sped up and edited. Star Trek II showed the cunningness of Kirk and the sacrifice of individuals. Star Trek III talked about loyalty to friends, those friends closer than family. Star Trek IV was just plain cool and a bit funny. Star Trek V taught me that I need my pain. Star Trek VI showed the length to which friends go to help friends. The Original Series was best at drawing from very human source material, and exceeded the status of awesomeness when the three best friends that anyone ever had did it together. The Reboot lacked all of this, but most of all, it lacked heart.<br/><br/>I went in totally trailer-blind, so the Star Trek Reboot seemed exciting: To see the exact steps Kirk took to beat the Kobayashi Maru; To see just how Kirk became the youngest captain in Star Fleet history; I was genuinely curious to see just how that happened – to learn how one of the galaxies best strategists cut his teeth. I imagined Kirk played Kobi Maru calculated - like a tense poker hand - feigning a little sweat. Rather, he did a Cool Hand Luke and was all calm and nonchalant. (At least Luke was bluffing and there was a chance to lose.) The Kirk reboot was eating an apple! Ack! What reasonable outcome could he expect than to be expelled? <br/><br/>Yes, Star Trek needed a new breath of life. The TOS actors should not do another film, but Paramount and Gene Roddenberry's ghost should not have allowed that travesty. (I don't blame you, Gene.) The Reason Why: I spent my youth watching TOS, really came to appreciate the camaraderie of all the characters, including helmsmen, and genuinely enjoyed The Next Generation also. What the Reboot did was take 40+ years of history (1966 till present) and threw it out the window – completely erased my knowledge of a fictional universe and said, ""Thanks for your money. Now it is time to go."" My pop knowledge of Mirror, Mirror, The Naked Now, The Apple and all those hours watching premier episodes of TNG – it is all irrelevant. It does not exist. Thus, they do not respect us and the agreement that was in place. They create stories within certain guidelines, and we'll believe them.<br/><br/>What the reboot did was break the contract that existed between the Star Trek franchise and every self-respecting fan of good, quality writing. By changing the time line, none of the stories that were written 40 years ago mean a thing. By changing the time line, they stole the soul, the essence of the Captain Kirk everyone knew – one that grew up with his father as a guiding influence to join Star Fleet, who had and lost a brother, who may have handled the Kobayashi Maru with real poise (now we will never know) – and turned him into a joke. I really wanted to see how the Kobi Maru happened, and not some sloppy excuse by a weak writer who can call upon ""alternate realities"" to get away with anything.Very simply, the ""writers"" (and, yeah, I have to put that in quotation marks) took the super easy road and hacked out this... less than average movie.<br/><br/>To me, I do not give the reboot any credit to qualify as a Star Trek movie. More than anything, it was just a movie that happened to have some familiar names. If the Trekies accept it into the chronicles, then they can say good-bye to Captain Picard, Commander Riker, Mr. Data, and the whole of the Enterprise-D. Given such a loose and fast story, nothing is safe to take for granted. And that is too bad. They burned down the library and threw away the reel-to-reel tapes for a quick buck, for a director who happened to be on a hot streak and for writers who wrote Xena: Warrior Princess episodes! Ack! I like the classics, but look forward to new stories. I did not mind that this reboot pre-dated the whole series. Learning how Kirk became the youngest captain was a new story to all of us. But they absolutely melted and destroyed any semblance of TOS. TNG, DS9, Voyager – all gone.<br/><br/>What is worse about the reboot is that I went into it for some reassurance. For a message that said, even though the world is changing, here is something that is rock solid. Instead, they pulled the rug right out from under everyone and said, ""Ta da! Here is a malformed ash tray that a high school freshman could write."" <br/><br/>Clinging to the past isn't always healthy, but in this case, simply put, ""Old Star Trek – Good. New Star Trek – Bad."" IMDb does not allow for zero stars. Too bad since that is my assessment of those folks riding the coat tails of others. Star Trek V taught me I need my pain. It makes me who I am. So, sure I am a bit disappointed, but out of respect to Star Trek V, and all the other good work out there, it helped/inspired me to write this review and I hope this particular view can help others gain their own perspective."

","This film is definitely one that is worthy of the press it received. The characters are all well developed and I love it that they did that for ALL the characters and not just Spock and Kirk. <br/><br/>A lightning storm in space causes the crew of the USS Kelvin to stop and send the information they're getting to Earth. Upon the revelation of this massive ship, the USS Kelvin is attacked, The Captain is going aboard the ship in a shuttle and is killed by Nero. George Kirk now assumes command and orders an evacuation but--he can't get out because autopilot has been disengaged so he has to fight them off. As Mrs Kirk is leaving in the shuttle and seconds before he collides into the Romulan vessel the two name their son Jim. <br/><br/>Years later, Jim is in a bar fight and Captain Pike tells him of the noble sacrifice his father made so that he could be born and live his life. Pike convinces Kirk to join Starfleet (and a bad beating which happened prior to Pike's intervention)<br/><br/>Kirk is in school 'studying' for the Kobyashi Maru which is a no win scenario when he hears of a transmission that 47 Klingon warbirds were destroyed. Kirk passes the test but is brought before the academic review board when the board receives a transmission that Vulcan has sent a distress signal and are experiencing seismic activities. 7 vessels show up but the Enterprise is late because of a small misstep. Kirk convinces Captain Pike and Commander Spock that this has something to do with the warbirds that were destroyed and the lightning storm that happened the day he was born. The Enterprise shows up and is attacked while the Captain is shuttling over, he assigns Sulu, Kirk and Crewman Olson to disable the drill that is drilling a hole into Vulcan that will make the implode the planet. They are successful and now Spock goes down to get his parents. His mother dies when the transporter can't lock onto her signal awhile the planet disintegrates. <br/><br/>Kirk makes more of a stir and is marooned when he defies the now Captain Spock's orders to go to the Lawrencian star system and join the fleet. Kirk meets Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and is told he has to get command of the ship, this is where we meet Scotty. The two are told of the fact that Spock in the future was involved in a plan to save the Romulan planet but was late to the draw and Nero the villain of the film captured Nimoy Spock and marooned him on the same planet so that he can watch Vulcan be destroyed--powerless to stop it. <br/><br/>Scotty and Kirk are beamed upon the Enterprise and Kirk makes Spock see that he is emotionally compromised and can't command the ship. Course: Earth. They go to Earth, disable the drill and use a ship piloted by Nimoy Spock to collide into the Romulan vessel and red matter that was used to destroy Vulcan ignites pulling the vessel in on itself. Kirk offers to help but the Romulans say no. The ship is destroyed but the Enterprise is jeopardized, they eject the warp core and detonate it which pushes the ship from danger. Now the adventures begin ==================================<br/><br/>This one was amazing! I loved the fact that the film took a different direction from the events of the series thereby creating another reality so to speak. It was well done and as a trekkie, I love the fact that anyone could understand it even if they were not a fan of the original series. This was a job well done!"
"logangiese","10","4","9","23 March 2010"," Best J.J. Abrams movie to date
","The new Star Trek movie is the second coming of what seemed to be a dead franchise. It brings back the classic characters of the mischievous yet responsible Captain Kirk and the always uptight but humorous in his own right First Officer Spock. The film begins with a great but one-sided battle between the Federation and a mysterious alien ship that seems to have a vendetta against anything that moves. Fast forward twenty some odd years later and you have a young rebellious Kirk joining the Federation out of pure frustration and Spock being disobedient to his elders by also joining the Federation. Spock's story alone makes for a good movie and his character really evolves from what viewers are used to. He seems to have a certain swagger that he didn't have before. Of course Spock and James T. Kirk meet up at Federation school and have several humorous moments before their fate collides them together into a fantastic voyage. What makes a good movie great are the side characters involved. All the characters from the original show are in this movie and every new actor playing that character is magnificent. Everybody from Dr. McCoy played by Karl Urban to Scotty played by the delightful Simon Pegg. Director J. J. Abrams hits another homerun that seems certain to be one of the highest grossing blockbusters this summer. The special effects are what you expect from this type of movie, which is top notch and the script writing allows you to dive right into the movie. The other summer blockbusters have a lot to live up to now."

If you have invested in a premium home entertainment system, with wide screen, hi-fi stereo and blu-ray disk, you will collect on your investment watching this film.<br/><br/>Excellent actions scenes. There's fist fights, running firefights with phasers, and ship to ship battles.<br/><br/>Also, there's a cute sense of nostalgia. I like the fact that the original Enterprise bridge noises are back.<br/><br/>The bad: <br/><br/>The theme music is lame, and there really is too much of it. Every second scene seems to conclude with an unnecessarily loud blast of orchestral crescendo. I find this annoying. And as directing techniques go, it's about as subtle as holding up a placard saying ""this is really dramatic, folks!"" <br/><br/>And more importantly, the characters' motivations are somewhat nonsensical. For this reason, I have rated the film only 6, rather than 7. I just found it a little disappointing that JJ Abrams didn't take the opportunity of this ""reboot"" of Star Trek to give us a slightly more intelligent plot."

","This movie features sci-fi action at its best! I'm perfectly fine with Trekkies' 'this-ain't-no-longer-our-beloved-Star-Trek'-weeping and wailing, because this is the sci-fi flick we have been waiting for. Does anyone remember the last movie that featured top notch space battles, sweet action scenes, adorable characters, illogical plots, and, to sum it up, more entertainment than you can stomach?<br/><br/>The plot(if it is worth mentioning): some angry Romulan captain, called Nero, ventures through time and space to capture Spock in the past, since he is convinced that the Vulcan ambassador is responsible for the destruction of his home planet. He seeks vengeance - the destruction of Vulcan - and aspires the harsh end of the Federation. Well, as fate wants it, young Kirk and his fellows get in his way, realizing that they're too late, and that the time-line they were supposed to be in has gone to hell - thanks to Nero, the black-hole traveling redneck.<br/><br/>This sounds a lot like the ordinary sci-fi plot, and it surely is, yet it was executed so tremendously excellent, from the CGI, the characters (especially Kirk and young Spock), and the action, as I have mentioned afore. It is, bluntly put, brilliant entertainment that will leave your sci-fi desires satisfied until Cameron's AVATAR makes its way to the big screen in December.<br/><br/>If you haven't done so already, watch STAR TREK!"

Most of the Star Trek movies are sketchy when it comes to the story, the only exception being The Wrath of Khan. This movie is worse than most. The story makes no sense.

","The good news is the great cast and faithfulness to the characters we love. The bad news is that this production is just like JJ Adams TV show ""Lost""- reminding me during the movie of Austin Power's take off on Time Travel. They are so blatantly diluting the continuity to give them wide abandon for future ""sequels"". Come on, it doesn't take that much work to write the story the way it unfolded for the last 40 years. Someone has to reign in JJ Adams. He's got his hands on a fabulous property, don't ruin it.<br/><br/>The entire population and planet of Vulcan is gone? There's a lot of Vulcans in the story lines of the rest of the Star Trek movies and TV shows, so none of that happened? Why the need to kill Spock's mother, who we meet in the original series? Where were the volcanoes on Vulcan? Why would the elders be standing around a fire while there's a big drill from the sky coring their planet? Why does it take Spock running in to tell them to leave? Not logical. Why was the cop who stopped young Kirk in the corvette a robot? Where were the black people in Star Fleet academy? Where were the aliens we have previously seen? Where are the handicapped people (aside from Pike).<br/><br/>Great that they used Leonard Nimoy, but I hope they also got some of the rest of the surviving original cast and Next Generation and Voyager (and I guess even Enterprise) on some kind of footage. <br/><br/>I am grateful for sure for the fabulous casting, most of the writing was excellent to spectacular, the special effects were nice but some of them were poorly used. The chase scene with the big monster who chases Kirk into the cave was more Galaxy Quest GoRigNak than Star Trek- any series. Establishing shots need to be a little longer.<br/><br/>Although I accept that Spock was waiting there in the cave... just happened to be the same planet, just happened to be the right cave... and no explanation why Spock hadn't gone to the nearby space station and warned someone... but the glib passing over of why Spock didn't come with Kirk - to not deprive him of the friendship he'd make with Spock???? BS. No homage to the original bridge- OK, one sound effect... but the chair should have been the chair at least, the curved bridge...<br/><br/>In any case, I could forgive the small technical stuff and even some of the leaps of faith required if I wasn't so afraid of the broad license they can take from here out. This is not ""Lost"" and you can't do the ""Dallas"" thing where the little boy falls out of bed and its all a dream. Star Wars worked their prequel without the time travel excuse, come on Star Trek!<br/><br/>And what's the next movie... Star Trek, How we returned Old Spock to the right time line?"

Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film. In fact, I give it a thumbs up. Still,it's not half as great as the hype. There are a handful of loud scenes, some chuckles, but not enough gas to cover even the action junkies who don't care about a plot. This movie simply does not work as an action piece but doers work for the Trekkie. In the end, Star Trek provides for a few bangs, but doesn't turn it into a full-blown summer film and ultimately, not as great as everyone keeps trying to say that it is. Considering that it was suppose to revive a dead franchise and reportedly had a huge budget, I wonder where the money truly went? I'm betting it went in to advertising and paying Internet bloggers.

","This was a good action film, which started out at maximum velocity and somehow managed to keep this momentum nearly constant throughout. Unfortunately, it did this by compressing time in a jarring way, and quickly glossing over anything which didn't involve an explosion. For a science fiction film, it had very little science in it, and demanded an awful lot of suspension of disbelief for the tech it did include. While it was an entertaining watch with all the fights, chases, more fights, and death-defying craziness, I left feeling pretty hollow. What was once great science fiction has been reduced uncomfortably close to the level of movies like Armageddon. If you strip away the sexy effects and improbable action sequences, you're left with only nostalgia for characters which were painstakingly developed by greater storytellers. I can't help but feel disappointed, no matter how realistic and impressive the new Enterprise looked."

Also, Anton Yelchin is adorable. I remember him as Charlie Bartlett in the movie with the same title. Let's just say I like the actors they chose for the movie. It was great hearing ""Live Long & Prosper"" (although I wasn't happy that it took me nearly 20 minutes to get my fingers to do the Spock salutation), and ""Good God, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a"", but I was, however, a little disappointed I didn't hear ""I just can't do it Captain, we don't have the pow'r"" But the movie was still AWESOMEand I hope there will be a No.2!

","Garbage. This director understands something, but it is not Star Trek. The movie that is here is a shallow and misguided journey into the ego of the director. There are to many people in this film, the violence is gratuitous and contributes nothing to the story. The actor playing Spock is good as an enraged ""hero"" but unbelievable as a Vulcan. There is no character development at all. There seems no context for the characters and no context for the story. The so-called ""spectacular"" effects are overblown. The real appeal of the Star Trek series has been the characters, not the explosions. Maybe if the director had a name instead of initials, there might have been a story here. In effect, this production team has killed the series for good. Hollywood has lost the soul of making good science fiction.

","I was 8 in 1966 when Star Trek released. My imagination was full of Apollo missions, Lost in Space, The Outer Limits, The Twilight zone, Thunderbirds. You younger ones not alive then cannot imagine the thrills and optimism these shows elicited in a kid in Australia. My corn flakes packs had models of the lunar module, the command module and other exotic space vehicles. I would dig into each pack and put the toys together before eating the cereal. Not everyone owned a TV, and they were B&W. My parents brought one for the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. In 1969 I watched the moon landings in a house close to my school because the school did not own a TV. I saw 2001 when it was released at the cinema. So enough reminiscing. I have seen every Star Trek episode made in the 60's. I have seen every Star Trek film. I am not into the derivatives. Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura and Sulu are my old friends, and I wanted this film to treat them with respect, honour and humanity. This film dished it out in spades with humour, compassion, intelligence and verve. And filled in some gaps. Why was he called Bones? It is a lovely, action packed and emotional return to what inspired me as a child. I don't need a sequel."
"runeba5","Null","3","6","25 September 2010"," Typical bastardization
","The makers of the film were seeking to effectively reboot the Star Trek franchise but they went about it in a way that is aggravating, poorly thought out, and ultimately insulting to the Star Trek franchise in general. For the film doesn't just reboot the Star Trek universe. No, it has a plot that erases all the previous shows, movies, characters, and stories of Star Trek from existence! Well, at least from the Star Trek universe's reality, at any rate. It's like finding out in the last chapter of a novel that everything you've read up to point had been a dream. And worse, it's as if the author had no idea that he had suggested as much! The plot of the film involves villainous characters traveling back in time from a date that, presumably, immediately postdates the end of Voyager, in order to interfere with Federation history. The plot details are irrelevant: Let's just say that these villainous characters, by the end of the film, succeed marvelously in interfering with Federation history and changing the time-line. This is how Abrams and his writers chose to reboot the franchise–not by starting from scratch, but by logically connecting it to the regular Star Trek canon and using time-travel shenanigans to put the young versions of the original series characters on a new path. In a rather ham-fisted scene, Zachary Quinto's Spock and Zoe Saladan's Uhura explain to the audience that the characters are now on a new path–on an alternate time-line'–and that their destinies have been changed. But what about the destinies of, I don't know, the cast all post-OS shows? How could all those characters be born–or the stories which they're were involved in occur–given that the villain of the film has successfully interfered with history? In a scene that is perhaps intended to call back to Star Wars: A New Hope, the planet of Vulcan is destroyed. Now if we watch Next Generation or DSN we know we're watching a time-line that doesn't exist and perhaps characters who most likely were never born.<br/><br/>Apparently it has only recently dawned on Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman–the writers of the film–of the implication of their plot. Orci has been going around claiming that the time-line which bad guys came from (the time-line of all the shows and movies) somehow remains intact, due to quantum mechanics (?!?), and that the universe Abrams film takes place in will now be one that is parallel to that other, regular universe. Except for one problem: no where in Star Trek movies or shows has it been suggested that time travel leads to the creation of a parallel universe. Indeed, in all the Star Trek plots involving time travel, it's never suggested that the good characters need not worry about some bad guy going back in time and meddling with things since it would just create a new time-line that cannot effect the one that the characters are in. Indeed, the time-travel stories always depended on the assumption that there is one time-line which time travel can alter. Since Abrams and his duo of writers (the same brilliant scribes that brought us the recent ""Transformers"" flicks) unwisely chose to connect themselves with the established canon (via the time-travel story), the same rules as all other Star Trek movies/shows/stories apply–and so, by implication, since the bad guys of the film succeeds in going back in and meddling with things, all the Star Trek stories we are familiar with have effectively been retconned out of existence, never mind what Robert Orci claims.<br/><br/>The plot of film, by the way, has much else that is wrong with it. Kirk is jettisoned on a snowy planet on which he randomly happens to run into two characters that are crucial to the plot. In Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, it is mentioned that Kirk, by cheating, happened to have passed in his Starfleet Academcy days the insurmountable Kobayashi Maru tactical test. Abrams film proves that things that are reputed to be legendary about characters are perhaps best left as legends.<br/><br/>The direction of the film isn't much to speak of either. It suggests the work of a director painfully aware of his limitations working hard to dazzle us with the superficialities he is only capable of. The interior of the Enterprise, for god knows why, is distractingly bright. And there is much needless shaky hand-held camera work. Many of the aliens that are shown have faces that look like reflections off fun-house mirrors. There's a scene that involves Kirk making love to a green alien–except she looks entirely like a cheerleader of the Dallas cowboys who has been painted green. Abrams forced kinetic style seems incongruous with the spirit of Star Trek. There is simply no grace.<br/><br/>But in the end, it's the time-travel plot that remains the glaring fault of the film. By implication, it negates all other Star Trek stories. And it is indicative of the cheap plot device that time-travel has in general become in science fiction. It's not an original story but rather something that even the most non-creative movie executive could have thought up to reboot the franchise. Moreover, it actually undermines the purpose of a reboot because it beholds any sequels to the rules and premises established in the regular canon. But should this incompetence surprise us? After all, over the last months Abrams has been announcing at the top of his lungs that he had not been familiar with Star Trek before being asked to shoot the film. He was sneakily suggesting that as a consequence his approach would be all the more original because of that lack of familiarity. Paramount has chosen to hand the reigns of the series to someone who is eager to announce his lack of interest in it, and the franchise would have been better served remaining in Rick Berman and Brannon Braga's hands."

"sue-dixon73","10","7","20","21 February 2020"," Thoroughly enjoyable
","I saw this many years ago & I remember going to cinema with some trepidation . I am a Star Trek fan right from the Original Series ,through to The Next Generation, Voyager, DS9 . Plus all the previous films .
Star Trek is an idea of a Universe which ideally we should all strive for , all races, species, sexes , working together in the most wonderful way . Really did not want this new film to ruin the franchise.
Well , I was not disappointed , I came out of the cinema totally energised, entertained , and happy with the end result. Yes the film may have lens flares , lots of action , and the like , which may be construed as veering away from the previous Star Trek universe. But I actually think that this film benefitted from the advances in special effects in recent years which made the whole thing look more 'real' in a way. The previous incarnations of Trek were unable to benefit from this due to technical constraints and funds at the time they were made. But all the necessary ideals put forward by Roddenberry are all there . The casting is brilliant , and with a few notable differences are mostly the same as in the original series.
Obviously each to their own , but I for one was very impressed . My advice would be to ignore the naysayers who have just gone down the list of reviews and blindly put a thumbs down on any review that gives over a 7 and make up your own minds . LLAP 👍"
"Offworld_Colony","10","7","20","7 February 2020"," The quintessential example of a perfect reboot.
","Everything fires on all cylinders, not least of all the electric and amusing acting, some rich kinetic photography, clever callbacks and nuanced emotion.
Perhaps re-tutored the world in how to build artistically presented blockbusters, for a spell anyway.
The film that made Star Trek cool. It was always fun, heartfelt and adventurous, but it wasn't all those things *and* cool.
Abrams manages to make a gripping and fresh and pitch-perfect reboot with an equally pitch perfect cast. We don't see too little or too much of the prequel elements of Star Trek and there are enough clever references that it's not too cloying or befuddling to those new to Star Trek. The timeline altering is just an absolutely perfect idea and there's a real sense of classic movie magic and an ingenious modern spirit injected into this movie that makes it timeless and consistently excellent.
The 4K UHD isn't a huge leap above the blu-ray in terms of image because it was a pretty fine entry as it was, but the sheer contrast between the lights and darks in this movie are eye-popping and colours are strong and nuanced without being overwhelming."

","I quite enjoyed this. It is a simple, end-to-end action adventure set in space. It doesn't attempt to moralise or philosophise, it is just an interstellar shoot 'em up. Chris Pine is pretty wooden, Zachary Quinto does a passable Mr. Spock and Anton Yeltsin seems to be having a good time trying to get the onboard computer to recognise his particularly thick accent. Sadly Eric Bana completely lacks menace as ""Nero"" and Simon Pegg's ""Scotty"" is just plain irritating but the special effects are stunning.

Roddenberry would be proud.<br/><br/>That alone would make this movie memorable, but not only does J.J. Abrams manage to pack a lot of action into this film without detracting from the story, but he also manages to give each of the characters in the ensemble enough screen time to come across in a satisfying way without making the film seem unbalanced.<br/><br/>Ordinarily, I don't think that most movies need sequels, but this one would manage one very well.

"peachmahoney","10","5","13","9 May 2009"," A Big Splashy Hollywood Summer Movie with Good Acting and Great Writing?!?
","When I step into the summer multiplex, I know that in order to have a good time, there are certain things I'm going to have to ignore like the terrible writing and embarrassing acting. I need to remind myself ""I'm here for the blasting air conditioning and to see some stuff explode.""<br/><br/>So imagine my surprise when I saw the excellently acted and smartly written reboot of Star Trek. JJ Abrams was wise to chose mostly unknowns and B listers for the core roles. Chris Pine, as James Kirk breathes a rebellious and tender core into the character. This is a rough and tumble Kirk with damage and a bad attitude. Pine creates a Kirk worth cheering for. Heroes' Zachary Quinto is pitch perfect as Spock both psychically and emotionally. As expected Simon Pegg infuses Scotty with humor and hipness needed for this type of franchise. A huge surprise here is Zoe Saldana as Uhura. Saldana is an actress I'm familiar with from campy movies like Crossroads (with Britney Spears!), Center Stage, and Drumline. But her resume is completely forgiven when she steps on screen as Uhura. Sexy, strong, and brilliant this is not the quiet Uhura of the past. There's a sadness and vulnerability that she displays as well but I'm not telling you how or why that happens.<br/><br/>In fact, the script is so well written each scene filled with surprises that I'll leave the spoilers to someone else. Instead, I'll simply talk about the quality of the writing. Orci and Kurtzman smartly pepper each scene with little and vital Trek details without trying to hard. And the structure of the plot is GENIUS. The pair wisely avoided cramming too many details in and stuck with a strong story. What a concept! Around each corner of the film, is something to thrill, delight, and even touch the viewers.<br/><br/>Abrhams should also be applauded for his smart and stunning direction. Actual sets and not tons of CGI give this Trek an authentic, tangible feel much like the original series. He also avoids the self- congratulatory shots and masturbatory action sequences like other big budget films (cough, Dark Knight, cough, Watchmen, cough). Instead he develops the characters and focuses on the story. In short, it's amazing and classic like the first Superman and original Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>So the first big blockbuster of summer 2009 is one you don't have to be embarrassed to say you loved. You are allowed to keep your brain on while you watch it. You don't have to be a fan of the original to enjoy it. You just have to like great movies. And Star Trek is precisely that."

It was a home run all the way around especially in the casting. The original members should be proud of their stand ins.

"Suestonto","8","6","17","9 May 2009"," This is your grand father's Star Trek with Abrams' action.
","What is Star Trek? It is an extremely puzzling question. The creator of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry's visions of Star Trek are: morality play, adventure/mystery (to boldly go where no one has gone before). When Gene died, Rick Berman (executive producer) took over. His vision of Star Trek included many recycled clichés from previous ST episodes, the famous technobabbles, the aliens of the week, the weekly Phaser battles in the alley and the contrived writing. The die-hard fans, Trekkies, have different vision of Star Trek. Trekkies view Star Trek as a fictional universe. They value the custom design, the alien design, and the existed canon as the cores of Star Trek.<br/><br/>The movie Star Trek is marketed as ""Not your father's Star Trek"". Its aim is to attract the casual movie fans and the hardcore fans.<br/><br/>*Spoilers Alert*<br/><br/>In the movie, a Romulan villain, Nero, time traveled by accident to young James T. Kirk's era hoping to revenge against the Federation.<br/><br/>*Spoilers End* <br/><br/>The movie managed to mix stunning space battles with a lot of clichés from the old Star Trek. No doubt that casual movie viewers who don't understand Trek will be heart boiled because of the cinematic choreography and the visual excellence. Majority of Star Trek fans will love the funny clichés. The writing staff of the movie managed to use the time paradox to circumvent the canonical paradox created due to REBOOTING the franchise. This move will appease the die hard Trekkies. They too will be content. In every way, JJ Abrams and his crews has managed to accomplish the impossible, to satisfy every viewer group. Still, one question still lingers after watching this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Is this movie a Star Trek by using the original definition from Gene Roddenberry? <br/><br/>The clear answer is no. The movie does not involve with morality, mystery and adventure. Without incorporating these concepts, this movie lacks the SOUL of Star Trek. It is but a shell of itself.<br/><br/>Ironically, the movie did not scrap away the old Star Trek like Paramount promised. It is full of background clichés and stories base on the previous Star Trek movies and shows. It is still your grandfather's Star Trek."

","Star Trek is an impressive, extremely entertaining film that will delight trekkers, more casual fans (like this reviewer) and people new to the franchise alike. For me, the effect was the same as when I saw Star Wars as a boy more than 30 years ago. The keys are in the writing and the characterisation, some decent acting (particularly from Quinto and an extraordinarily well-preserved Nimoy) and a confident, joyous direction that shows Abrams was really having fun. And when the director is enjoying himself this much, so shall we. The story is tight, (mostly) holds together, there's a good villain and the script is believable. There are some delightful scenes and asides that really make this film, most notably (for me) the shimmering backdrops of 23rd-century Iowa (complete with gargantuan, unexplained buildings rising from the prairies), the believability of the interior of the spacecraft and nice touches like a Vulcan schoolroom. There are plenty of references and homages too that sci-fi fans will have fun with. Kirk gets (briefly) marooned on an ice-planet, shades of Empire Strikes back, and the inevitable multi-species cocktail bar near to the spaceport - both standard, and fun, sci-fi tropes. There are 'Lost'-like references too - the rather Dharma-like research station in which Scotty works, and of course the clever use of time travel as a coherent plot device rather than just a gimmick. Even the small things delight: the grubby bits of the Enterprise, the low-tech plastic industrial curtains, the Corvette and Kirk's motorbike. Good writing, good direction and good acting. Who needs special effects? But these are here, in abundance, as well. I wouldn't be surprised if this wins Oscars. A sequel? Make it so."

(b) Star Trek is officially alive and well!<br/><br/>With full credit to the decades of Star Trek that have come before this movie, I find myself forced to admit that I have never been so stoked or electrified by a Star Trek production in all my time as I was coming out of JJ's latest feature. While I must admit that I don't have that sense of being immersed in a deep moral issue in the way that so many Star Treks have done in the past, it's possible that those feelings have simply been overwhelmed by the excitement and rich plot that this wonderful picture boasts.<br/><br/>I'm not going to sit here and try to analyse each sub-component of the movie. The cast, plot, special effects, music and direction were all top notch, and - put together (which is what really counts) - they have produced a feast for the senses as well as the intellect.<br/><br/>What I will comment on in particular was an aspect that I hope many people will notice and appreciate - the realism and appreciation of physics that gives a credibility that is often lacking in space-based science fiction. A hole is torn in the hull of a ship, with an ensuing vaccuum that tears a screaming ensign from where she is holding on for dear life and throws her out into the void of space. As she passes the edge of the breach in the hull, the sound is choked off in an instant and replaced with nothing but the eerie silence of space. It is frightening and stirring, and I anticipate future space-based sci-fi taking this route. This is just one of the ways that this new Star Trek has been yanked forward and steeped in an unforgiving reality, but one that many fans and friends alike have clamoured for over the years.<br/><br/>I feel that I could sit here and talk about this movie forever, but rather than spoil any more I'll just summarise by saying that - for me - this movie has reinvented the Star Trek universe in so many ways, and I cannot wait to see what can be made of it. While I wait, I will rest content in the knowledge that Star Trek no longer simply holds the crown for thoughtful, moral cinema, but excitement and thrills as well.<br/><br/>10/10 for a movie that I cannot think of ways to improve."

","Based on the trailers and all the talk prior to the release of this movie, I already knew that this Star Trek would be different than others and that I had to change my expectations accordingly and watch this movie as a slight different take on Star Trek as we knew it.<br/><br/>I did and I was not disappointed. One person here said it was Star Trek on steroids and I totally agree. The pace is faster, action scenes are more intense, Ships and battles have a more greatness about them and most characters seem a bit more natural instead of utopian.<br/><br/>While older Star Trek movies often seemed like a rather lengthy episode and seemed that they were filled with obsolete scenes just to make it long enough to call it a motion picture, this new Star Trek gives you the satisfaction of watching an action-packed movie which doesn't allow you to fall asleep of boredom.<br/><br/>Special Effects are absolutely stunning. Go see them for yourself.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good. The three main characters (Spock, Kirk & bones) are very convincing and well cast. I especially enjoyed Karl Urban as Bones. Simon Pegg also did a good job on Scotty. I found him to be very amusing. Only Chekov and Sulu didn't really impress me (I never liked Sulu anyway), but they only played a minor part in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has some downsides however: - Due to the fast pace of the movie, some characters are introduced too fast to get really acquainted with them. - Villain (Eric Bana as 'Nero') is pretty generic. Although I like Eric Bana and he believe he did a decent job with the means he had. I think this character lacks some needed depth.<br/><br/>And of course there are some issues concerning the old star trek universe and this new (Chekov, who actually was still a little kid in the old star trek time-line) and the general discussion why such a reboot was necessary.<br/><br/>But if you let all those things go, then Star Trek XI is a great movie. <br/><br/>It's like comparing Peter Jackson's the Lord of the Rings to the original book by Tolkien. If you see the original as holy, then the new take will disappoint you and leave you frustrated, but if you see them as 2 different takes on the same story/concept, then you'll find them equally enjoyable.<br/><br/>I like both LOTR's as I learned to separate one from the other and enjoy the good things of both and now I am doing the same with Star Trek.<br/><br/>This movie has rekindled the Trekkie in me and I am looking forward to a sequel"
"ladyophelia101-1","5","4","10","11 May 2009"," In the hands of a better director it could've been great
","The new Star Trek movie should have done what Casino Royale did for the Bond franchise. Unfortunately, it ended up being more like Quantum of Solace.<br/><br/>The script, scribed by the people that brought you Transformers was distinctly incoherent. What I find interesting is that so many people admit to the many plot holes and yet seem to forgive the movie. Unfortunately, I can't do that. The story rests on a convoluted time travel/alternate universe storyline which makes little sense on numerous different levels. Then there is the fact that there are very little well executed character moments. The one character they did focus on, James T. Kirk was fitted with a dying Hollywood trope: the story of the rebel guy whose father is dead and has to live up to his father's memory. That was a storyline that was tired when they did it more than twenty years ago in Top Gun. But since they did decide to go that route, where was the emotion in Kirk when he was confronting that man responsible for killing his father. If anything this should have been the thing to bond him and Spock. But instead Spock decides to do one of the most illogical things a Vulcan could possibly do and maroon Kirk. Is there no brig on this Enterprise? Oh, but wait, the marooning leads Kirk through a series of roll-your-eyes coincidences to meeting Spock Prime so that's okay, I guess. And by the end of the movie Kirk, who hasn't even yet completed the academy is promoted to Captain of the Enterprise, flagship of Starfleet. I've heard of promotions in the battlefield but this one is just too much to swallow. That's like telling Harry Potter that for saving the Philosopher's Stone he gets to become superintendent at Hogworts! A lot of people have complained that the bridge of the Enterprise doesn't look like right. I can accept it looking different, but the Apple-store palette really needed to be toned down. It was just plain distracting. The flares were another problem. Abrams had lens flares where there was no possible reason for there to be one. I counted three in less than ten seconds. Definitely excessive.<br/><br/>For the most part, the cast did well, that is the main cast. Chris Pine was exceedingly annoying, but that's not a surprise based on the script. By the end at least, I could believe that he and Zachary Quinto were Kirk and Spock. Quinto started off the movie unable to convince me he was anyone but Sylar but really did do a tremendous job, even carrying his body like Spock. Karl Urban, as many have commented, seemed to be channeling DeForest Kelley. The most annoying of the crew was Simon Pegg. It's really not Pegg's fault. The scripting for Scotty was absolutely awful. The character spent far too much of the movie (what little he was in) playing for laughs. Another real low point was Eric Bana as Nero, who many will compare with Khan, but let's face it he couldn't even touch General Chang. Where's the scenery chewing? I just didn't care about this villain, and his back story as explained in the movie was fairly ludicrous. I understand its better explained in the comic, but if you need the comic to tell the story then you're not telling the story correctly.<br/><br/>The effects are indeed amazing. It looks gorgeous, with the exception of some weird spinning ship which was just annoying. It's the best you'll have seen Star Trek look, but unfortunately, in the end, it's all gloss. Ultimately the movie failed with the director. Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting Abrams in the league of Michael Bay for overt action but the fact is a lot of characterization and plotting was sacrificed in favour of ""cool"" unnecessary action sequences. Speaking of unnecessary, had I wanted to own this movie on DVD, I would literally edit out the car chase scene at the beginning. Not only is it utterly pointless, but it could be deleted and not effect the story one iota- not exactly a sign of good storytelling. I truly believe in the hands of a better director this might've been a better movie. Even the people that brought you Fantastic Four understood that the characters needed to be established first. Don't get me wrong, it's an interesting roller-coaster ride, but in the end it lacks substance, namely, heart. So if I hated it so much, why am I giving it a C? That's the thing. I didn't hate it. I just didn't really care. The movie felt unnecessary. I'd much rather have see a new Kirk and crew already established on the Enterprise than a rushed origins movie. Hopefully the next movie will do better. So long as they don't let Abrams in the big chair. Check out more reviews at http://www.igp-scifi.com"

","I'm an old school trek fan. Reruns in the early 70s every day after school. I've seen'em all 100 times each. I loved the characters. JJ did a great job picking new people to fill these shoes (literally). Spock and Bones are played well like you would guess they were. Kirk's goofy mannerisms from the 60s are gone, but his recklessness remains (his strength). The plot's a little thin and contrived but effective in pulling together these characters. We all know no one dies of consequence (except the red shirt guys :)) since we know their future (or do we?). The plot has the smart move of allowing for the past to change. If this wasn't there then the outcome would be all too well known. The only things they could have left out were the silly Bones/Spock banter. That type of stuff could have waited for the next movie. Another thing would be the theft of the plot from Wrath of Khan. Twisted yes, but borrowed from on a lot of levels.<br/><br/>9/10. Kirk's rise from cadet to captain was lame and should have taken longer. The villain was not the best. I doubt I could have come up with something better. It was worth the $5 I paid."
"Zedo","8","4","10","9 May 2009"," Easy to enjoy.
","Let me get my negative thoughts out of the way first: I was perturbed by the choice the creators of this film made regarding its odd relationship with the series (And the previous films). If you're familiar with Star Trek, you'll know what I mean. Once or twice during the film, I thought ""Wait, this can't be right..."" until I realized the unusual approach the filmmakers chose. In my opinion, it was a bad creative choice.<br/><br/>Despite that, I liked the movie quite a bit. If you aren't too familiar with Star Trek, you won't even notice the oddities. And in any case, the end product is a decent story, told with excitement and style.<br/><br/>I estimate that those behind the film were striving to make this acceptable to almost everyone, rather than trying to blow anyone's mind. They succeeded, as I can't imagine many people who wouldn't enjoy Star Trek. If you're a bitter hipster who only watches black & white films with just enough plot to deliver a sad ending, you probably weren't thinking about going to see this anyway. Everyone else, have fun!"
"Irishize","9","4","10","9 May 2009"," Takes me back to Star Wars in 1977!
","This really was a pleasure of a film. Abrahms has plotted a course that manages to get the balance of engrossing action and entertainment just right.<br/><br/>And entertainment is something that has been missing from the SciFi genre for a while. I'm just about old enough to have experienced Star Wars in the cinema in 1977. The feeling of seeing your imagination (as opposed to what some focus-group *think* people like) up there on-screen can't be beaten.<br/><br/>There is a scene on a snowy planet that is very reminiscent of Star Wars' Hoth - not in plot terms of course, but in the way it carries the viewer with the hero and the odds he faces. And another aboard the Romulan ship that conjures up the feelings of watching Mr. Skywalker battling for his life in ""Revenge of the Jedi"". This is just for comparison of course - the film is very confident in it's own universe, and Star Trek's fantastic range of characters and history is used to full (and respectful) effect here.<br/><br/>The design-work involved is top notch too. Influences from the original TV series are everywhere and the realism of 2001: A Space Oddysey is evoked also. The fight scenes are orchestrated so that they don't just feel like set-pieces, but real action moments.<br/><br/>The only slight gripe for me was Scotty. When I heard Simon Pegg was playing him I though it sounded like perfect casting. But I think his performance was hammed up too much for ""comic effect"" - and it didn't work. It was all the more apparent given the rest of the cast's believable performances as young versions of the classic cast. But we can forgive Mr. Pegg. As anyone who has seen the excellent series Spaced will know, his SciFi fan credentials are above reproach! All in all an excellent film that stays true to what makes Science Fiction on film one of the most compelling experiences."
"jheckler85","7","4","10","9 May 2009"," Not Great, but good
","I can totally get behind an action packed, alternate-universe Trek movie, god knows we needed one after the overly dramatic TNG movies, and this movie delivers on those points. Only complaint? Kirk goes from suspended cadet to 1st officer because he bursts onto the bridge with solid information for capt pike? (no other officers or not suspended cadets to choose from? ??) Then upon graduating, kirk skips the ranks of ensign, Lt, Lt Comdr, and Comdr goes straight to capt and his own ship, the Enterprise . Really? C'mon J.J. Oh, and Uhura and Spock hooking up? Why? There was no point to it. Other than that, great visual effects, not overdone like i was expecting, the enterprise looked great on the outside, but a mixture of a petroleum refinery and an ipod on the inside. The plot was sound, it was good to see the humorous Bones back in action, and the acting was better than expected, kudos to the casting director. Overall, a movie worth watching and owning (it'll look great on bluray)"
"iamdbm","8","4","10","8 May 2009"," Wonderfully ridiculous!
","This latest Star Trek offering is completely ridiculous. And incredibly wonderful! I'm not sure how people who aren't familiar with Star Trek will react because they'll miss the myriad references to elements of previous shows and movies, but those who've seen the classic TV series will have tremendous amounts of fun. Over and over again throughout the movie I kept asking myself ""How is he doing this?"" Meaning, how is the director managing to both make fun of and deeply appreciate Star Trek at the same time. There is both strong emotional connection to the characters and great campiness every minute of the movie. The only thing I found slightly off-putting was the casting. I would sometimes get distracted from the film as I tried to identify the face hidden behind a thin layer of alien makeup. If you're any kind of Star Trek fan at all treat yourself to two hours of fun and go see this film."
"tbiegalski","7","4","10","7 May 2009"," Felt more like Star Wars than Star Trek
","As an action space opera, the new Star Trek is great. As Star Trek, it is lacking. It is an action filled shoot-em-up with wonderful effects, competent acting, and an exciting story. However, it lacks intelligence, which it tries to desperately make up for with style and wit. It felt more like Star Wars than Star Trek. There was no message (unlike previous Star Trek, so much of which was modern morality tales and intelligent sci-fi fables) - unless you count the typical Disney bs of believing in yourself, or the importance of teamwork. It is just what you would expect from the commercials. We can only hope that the money which this will make will lead to more intelligent ventures into the franchise. Makes me miss Bill Shatner."

"fwomp","10","5","14","13 May 2009"," Star Trek -- The Next Series Has Begun...
","Okay. How do you re-imagine STAR TREK, one of the largest sci-fi franchises in the world, and do it without alienating the ""trekkies"" and, at the same time, not lose an audience of new watchers who may not be that familiar with it? The first thing you do is hire J.J. Abrams, the genius behind the LOST series on TV. Abrams is making a serious name for himself in Hollywood, and it took some serious c@hones to take on a project that could literally blow up in his face. Re-imagining Star Trek with an all-new cast and a new storyline was seriously risky ...but the risk has paid off big time.<br/><br/>The thing Abrams seems to be aware of is that entertainment (be they TV or big screen) is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. Let me say that again in case you missed it: entertainment is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. You can have action, adventure, cool CGI, but it's how the characters respond to such things that pull the audience in, and Abrams has done that with extreme care here.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, however, some trekkies are gonna be seriously pi$$ed about this. Much has been altered (by way of time travel ...but that's the only semi-spoiler I'll give) and the new Kirk (Chris Pine, SMOKIN' ACES), Spock (Zachary Quinto, 24), Bones (Karl Urban, LORD OF THE RINGS) and the rest are only shadows of what they once were on TV. Even so, there are plenty of inside jokes for trekkies to enjoy (""I'm a doctor not a physicist!""), including finding out if Kirk always does get ""the green chick,"" Chekov's (Anton Yelchin) battle with his accent and the computer recognizing him, and Sulu's (John Cho) fighting abilities. The other thing that'll rankle true trekkies is Spock's emotional state. But let's remember that Spock is half-human, and always battled with his emotions, from the beginning of the series and even on in to The Next Generation where another Vulcan (Sarek) gives over his weakening emotional thoughts to Captain Picard so that he can finish negotiations.<br/><br/>The great thing about this newest version is that it relaunches Star Trek when it was headed downhill. The Next Generation is dead. ENTERPRISE is ...not good. DEEP SPACE 9 has been ousted for some time. And no new films with older cast members were in the works. So, although trekkies might ""hate"" what's been done to their beloved series, they won't bemoan the possibility that this newest version will bring in fresh blood to their ranks. But is that enough? No.<br/><br/>What Abrams and the rest did was incorporate just enough of what made the classic Star Trek part of our culture (honestly, who doesn't know where the term, ""Live long and prosper"" came from) while giving us an action-packed, summer popcorn movie that'll please just about anyone. And I say this with all sincerity. When I went to the theater, there were teenagers and octogenarians in the audience. In fact, a buddy I went with brought his mother and grandmother, and they both loved it! Quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>This one's a sure winner. And I noticed that another film is in the works for 2011. Let's hope this new series truly does live long and prosper."

I hadn't seen a good movie in what seemed to be a VERY long time; that all changed yesterday.<br/><br/>I went in thinking I was going to enjoy this movie; this obviously set the bar high. This movie had no problem meeting (and exceeding) my expectations. I don't think it is in a movie's favor to satisfy my expectations, but this one did it very easily.<br/><br/>The cast was spot-on! What a great selection...kudos must be given to the talent scouts for this movie. I didn't mind some of the - what some will consider corny clichés (there were probably 3 or 4)- as the movie's performance is off the charts.<br/><br/>I haven't wanted to see the same movie more than once in a very long time. I would go see this one again, and would do so tonight. I am very much looking forward to the next one..."

","J.J. Abrams did a better reinvent for Star Trek than Bryan Singer did for Superman! This made me feel good like watching Christopher Nolan's reinvented Batman. This cast really hit it out of the park with this movie, and I welcome a sequel or more.<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto made an excellent Spock, which I never really doubted. His ""temper tantrum"" made me feel like he was really feeling what Spock should be going through at the time. An excellent performance! Being a Heroes fan as well, I was hoping for Spock to open some heads. GRIN! <br/><br/>Simon Pegg was a perfect Scotty! I was truly amazed that when he wasn't on the original crew to begin with, but I'm glad he was added. Star Trek... based on the original series... wouldn't be Star Trek without Scotty.<br/><br/>So, Mr. Abrams, I hope to see the next installment of this reinvented series in the next 2-3 years. IMHO, you'd be wise to cash in on this goldmine."
"MReed542","10","5","14","10 May 2009"," I've already seen it twice!
","OK so I'm old enough to have actually watched the shows as a child and yes, my husband was wearing Spock ears the first time I met him (it was Halloween), and yes, I have the original Hallmark Star Trek Enterprise Christmas Ornament in a safe deposit box so when I give this movie a 10 out of 10 you can believe that it's a 10!(Not that I even come close to true Trekkies but...this movie was so great that I have already seen it twice since it opened 2 days ago!) <br/><br/>The loudest applause definitely goes to JJ Abrams who so perfectly captured every nuance of the essence of Star Trek that it's a real shame the Academy Awards Committee doesn't think that Sci-Fi is art.<br/><br/>The actors could not have been more perfectly cast nor could they have played these legendary parts with higher quality. I felt like each one of the actors respected these characters deeply and cared for them as if it were the greatest honor in the world to play them.<br/><br/>Chris Pine channeled William Shatner and I swear that Zachary Quinto and Leonard Nimoy are related somehow. McCoy was awesome and Scotty? Wow. Just not enough Scotty though. Uruha. Such a GREAT update to her character while staying true to it.<br/><br/>I loved the nods to favorite episodes and even the style of the bad guy music was reminiscent of the old battle scenes in the original series.

"RMS1949","9","5","14","10 May 2009"," I made my decision...

And this coming from a longtime fan of the 60's series...<br/><br/>The new Star Trek movie was exciting, stimulating and just plain fun. I really believed these were the younger versions of the Star Trek crew that I enjoyed as a kid.. It did not try to lecture us, or remind us of anything, it just tried to be entertaining. And to me it absolutely did so. I'm sure a second film will be in the works if this one is a success. And I think it will be. So here's my hand raised for someone looking for it.."
"Wolfiemann","10","5","14","10 May 2009"," To quote William Shatner, ""Get a life will ya people""
","First off, I am 41 and have grown up with Star Trek my whole life, (since the 1st grade). I have watched and own every episode of every series (including the animated), I have read the comics, and I have seen every movie multiple times. I consider myself a Trekkie, not one of the overbearing Trekkers who get P.O.'d at every little thing that does not fit what they think is Gene Roddenberry's vision. I also state that this is my opinion, not assume I can state Gene's or any other affiliated Star Trek persons opinion.<br/><br/>That said, I thought this was an absolutely fantastic movie. If die hard Trekker's think about it, many of the story line complaints make sense in that this whole movie created and is based on an alternate time-line for the Star Trek universe which I think was utterly brilliant of J.J. Abrams.<br/><br/>By the Romulans going back in history and killing Kirk's father, Spock's Mother, and destroying Vulcan, they've completely changed the course of Starfleet history as we knew it up to now. This opens an entirely new universe of stories and possibilities for the franchise.<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto was exceptional as Spock as was Chris Pine as a young brash undisciplined Kirk. The entire cast was perfectly cast for their rolls. If I had any complaints, it would be the following: John Cho and Simon Pegg did not get enough screen time as their characters, and Chekov accent was very irritating. Otherwise it is an awesome Sci-fi movie and a great kick to the Star Trek franchise.<br/><br/>Trekkers need to remember: Everyone hated Next Generation at first, which became more popular than the original. Abhorred DS9, Voyager and Enterprise, which all became successes. Why? Because it grew on them over time. Give this film a chance, and don't compare to the originals, and you will see this is a splendid movie."
"jccwu","8","5","14","9 May 2009"," This film reminds us how fun & cool the original crew really were!
","Even though this new Star Trek movie is a prequel; its an updated look into its universe as it also pays a lot of respect to the original television series and its characters. You'll recognize a lot of the famous quotes and mannerisms from the famous crew. Some of the events in the film may even seem familiar, as they are mentioned in the original series and its earlier movies.<br/><br/>The problem that I did have with this film is that it deals with some of its characters that are not in the same time-line, which means that certain Star Trek history has been altered. In other words, there are now continuity errors that involves with the original series and movies. I felt that it was just an excuse to gather all the original crew together for this particular film and it gives the filmmakers the freedom to alter the Star Trek history for their future sequels.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a very enjoyable Star Trek film that reminds us how fun & cool the original crew really were. This is the movie that will regenerate the popularity of Star Trek again for the 21st Century."
"Rick_Swift","10","5","14","6 May 2009"," Fascinating rebirth of a classic
","J. J. Abrams brings his unique writing to a classic franchise. With Star Trek, he takes by far the most influential sci-fi series of all time and dons a Jedi cloak to reinvent the franchise with more grit, grime, and guts than the classic fare.<br/><br/>Always with my friends was the question, which is better Star Trek or Star Wars, as Abrams claims he was never into Star Trek, I was expecting a darker, more one-dimensional Star Trek - and that is what I got. Even the music had dynamic horns and choir voices reminiscent of John Williams, except for a few scenes. Overall this will not have the same feel as any of the other movies, with the exception of the brutal Wrath of Khan - which we all know was the best of the Star Trek films - until now. Yes, I just said that, deal with it! I keep hearing, this isn't your father's Star Trek, no, it isn't - this is my son's Star Trek, and you know what - I am glad. I can keep my dad's Star Trek on the shelf and dust it off and wax nostalgic over days gone by, or I can engage to full warp and embrace this bold new interpretation on the classic. No reason they can't coexist.<br/><br/>Star Trek opens up with action almost immediately and only applies the dampeners a few times to fill in compelling story lines that will have you sympathetic to new and familiar characters. Telling the tale of the heroic James Tiberius Kirk and his quick advances through Star Fleet Academy, Chris Pine and Jimmy Bennett both enter the legend's boots, with dramatic success.<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto and Jacob Kogan both play the pointy-eared bastard, Dr. Spock as he carves out his own destiny by joining Star Fleet Academy against the Vulcan Science Academy's wishes. Spock is himself a child of two worlds, and is constantly struggling with fitting in wholly anywhere. Logic and science are his guide, while emotions of helplessness persistently haunt his thoughts.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana plays the vixen du jour, Nyota Uhura - yet another member of S.F.A. Russian born Anton Yelchin naturally assumes the stammering Pavel Chekov with a few chuckle-worthy scenes, but by far my favorite character, then as now is Bones, Dr. Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban). Urban brought a smile to my face as I swear the original DeForest Kelley possessed his body from wherever great souls reside when they reach that Final Frontier. Simon Pegg managed to effectively resurrect another missed old-friend, Scotty - who of course delivered his most famous line, no doubt Pegg insisted on that, can't say I blame him one bit.<br/><br/>These actors not only held their own, they owned these legendary characters masterfully, let's face it, it is simply impossible to fill the shoes of the unique William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. Pine's style and charisma comes across as genuine machismo and charm, he even gets to smooch a green-hottie, no doubt he insisted on that, can't say I blame him either. Not to be outdone, Quinto clearly has some green blood pumping through his veins. The two worked so well together in certain scenes, you forget this is just a couple of actors on the screen, you feel a certain tulpa has been created in the theater. Wonderful job guys; don't let any Trekkies tell you otherwise.<br/><br/>The casting was superb, kudos to all involved - whatever late night calls were placed at the last minute to pull this cast together, however much sleep was lost wondering if you got that right someone for the part - know ya' done good, folks.<br/><br/>It's hard to write this review in my typical non-spoiler fashion, so I will wait until I get some intense debate going here. I really must admit, I was so drawn into this movie, this story, the adventure, that I couldn't find one fault anywhere. And I gave this 6 stars because I can, I have the con - so to speak.<br/><br/>If you don't agree that this movie deserves the Blockbuster of the year, I guess you are just too hung up on the changes from the original concepts, the twists that make no sense to the uber-purists, but everything is accounted for in this film, no plot holes can be surmised because of the genius of J. J. Abrams. Let's not despise the fresh changes, let's embrace them as new Trekkies are recruited to boldly go where no man has gone before."
"greenusmarine53","10","6","18","8 May 2009"," 'Bout time someone cared enough to make great Trek **Spoilers**
","**Possible Spoilers** <br/><br/>So, yesterday I looked online to see the show times for Trek and lo, the theater I was going to had not only a midnight showing but a 7 and 9:30 PM showing as well for Thursday. Giddy as hell, I asked my boss, pleaded practically, to let me go be a geek for the evening. Afraid that my fellow geeks you descend upon the theater in droves, I got there six hours early and purchased tickets for both the 7 and 9:30 shows. With hours to kill, I watched 17 Again, which was pretty dern good, I even got a tickle in my nose there at the end. But anyway <br/><br/>Since learning that there was going to be a new Trek film, the geek portion of my life has been filled with nervous anticipation and sitting there in that seat was the culmination of all that worry and trepidation. The lights dimmed, trailers rolled by and It took me a moment to realize that the fist frames were of a ship flying by at close range. Radio chatter. Faran Tahir walks onto a dimly lit bridge. Hey, Hey that's the guy from Iron Man! Thus starts an absolute thrill ride where for the next 2 hours I am pulled back into a universe I had invested countless hours in but had never quite been satisfied with.<br/><br/>JJ and crew have done what I wish Berman and even Roddenberry had done. He has taken this franchise and breathed new life into it. There was an engaging story AND eye candy. I have always believed that the actors of the various shows and the fans and maybe a few writers were the only ones to truly care for the universe of Trek. The rest were money grubbing turds. Yes, even Roddenberry. (**gasp**) He gave birth to the idea and for that I will be forever grateful but even he fell into greed. But that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the actors performances. I'll keep it short by simply saying that all of them were fantastic. Even Anton Yelchin, who I had heard was a bit annoying in his interpretation of Chekov but there were a few times when I swear I could hear Walter Koenig. And if Zoe can move me with just a few lines, I greatly anticipate seeing more from that woman. And Spock beat the snot out of Kirk. Not gimmicky looking punches but a very brutal, visceral attack. Like I said, I could go on and on. One more thing, for those who think Simon Pegg was the comic relief, I think Chris Pine held his own on that point. ""Wellnot only."" HA! Classic.<br/><br/>The story. Yes, I've heard from a few die hards that the story failed on many points. I very much disagree, though there were a few holes. I do feel they should have spent a bit more time on Nero's character. As well as explained the whole time/alternate universe thing. Don't get me wrong. I got it. Personally I don't think it's that hard a concept to grasp but I'm looking at it from a non fans point of view. I read the Countdown story so I had the background but more of that should have been in the film. Eric Bana kinda got shortchanged on there. Someone asked the question, ""Where the hell was the rest of Starfleet?"" Well, they were in the Lorench (?) system or something. But still, a few defenses around Vulcan and Earth were in order. The only thing the bothered me, being military and all, was Kirk going from cadet to Captain in a few days, but hey, it was still a damn good story and a great first film.<br/><br/>About the eye candy. Yes, there was quite a bit but it was so beautiful in execution. Damn did they do a great job. It never took over. Okay, maybe once when the Enterprise came outta warp behind Titan (Hope y'all caught that nod). But it was a glorious shot. Perfect. And speaking of the new E, oh boy did she grow on me. To quote, ""I'd love to get my hands on her ample nacelles."" The visuals helped tell the story and except in that very necessary instance never became more important than that story. Understand, I watched the movie twice. The first was to get the googily eyes out of the way, the second to look at it a bit more critically. I might have failed a bit in that attempt, but like I said, this film is platinum. Oh! I didn't say that yet. Oh well, now I did.<br/><br/>I give this film ten stars, or two and a half thumbs up, or four outta four, or whatever, despite it's few flaws, for one simple reason. Everyone, even the dreaded Paramount and CBS powers that be (even if not for altruistic reasons) gave a damn about this universe and the characters. For a long time Trek fan (note: not FANatic) it's very refreshing. To actually care about what you are putting your name on. Imagine that!"

And I was so happy to see Leonard Nimoy to appear as Spock one last time. His acting was golden as usual. Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock) were great as well. There wasn't a moment in the movie where their acting wasn't good. Also when I think of Eric Bana (Nero), I don't usually picture him as a bad guy. He played Nero really well, and I was surprised on how well he did. <br/><br/>There is really no reason to hate this. Congratulations Abrams, you have another great movie out there!"

","In the future, mankind has created many space travel advances and is capable of exploring the universe. This film opens with James Kirk's father being killed by a rogue group of Romulans seeking revenge against Spock. The Romulans are a violent species of aliens and they believe that Spock caused the destruction of their homeland. Most of the plot revolves around the young life of James Kirk. He is rebellious and seems to be wasting his life until he is convinced to join Starfleet, the human space command. Kirk, along with the help of many friends he makes along the way, thwarts the attempts of the Romulans to destroy Earth. Main actors and actresses include: Chris Pike as James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Simon Pegg as Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott, Eric Bana as Nero, Karl Urban as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Hikora Sulu, and Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike.<br/><br/>There are a few different themes that I noticed in this film. The celebration of honor, friendship, commitment, and bravery was a common theme. A second theme surrounds James Kirk. This theme was that even a young person wasting his or her life can still become something great. Lastly, one last theme that I noticed was that even though Spock and Kirk are completely different in so many ways, they still become very close friends. The praise of honor, friendship, commitment, and bravery is depicted in various scenes throughout this film. First, James Kirk's father sacrifices himself to save the crew of his ship. He used himself as a decoy so the others could escape. Another scene that exemplifies this scene is that of the Starfleet students scrambling to join the war march to save Spock's planet instead of running away in fear. The second theme, how someone can change his or her fortune, is expressed through many scenes as well. This theme is more aimed at Kirk. He was a troubled youth with a mischievous and rebellious background. Through gut feeling, honor for his dead father, courage, and friendship Kirk saves many lives on planet Earth. He goes from scenes of rebelliousness to later scenes of honor and commitment. The third theme, how two opposite people can become friends, mostly relates to Spock and Kirk's relationship. These two first meet when Spock catches Kirk cheating in a virtual training exercise. Kirk gets to know Spock and later pulls emotion out of Spock in order to gain control of the Enterprise. Kirk does this by provoking Spock. After Kirk has proved himself worthy of respect by risking his life for others and saving earth, he and Spock become friends. Another film with this similar theme is the Fast and the Furious: Fast Five. In this film, Brian and Dominic prove very different in personalities, but with honor and love between the two eventually growing, these two completely different people become like family. Many invisible sounds and close ups were used to emphasize the theme of glorifying honor, friendship, commitment, and bravery. Emotional scenes used close ups shots of characters faces to show their honorable, friendly, committed, and brave expressions at perfect moments in the film. Also, during many scenes, invisible sounds were used to make scenes more 3 dimensional. Invisible sounds of Spacecraft mechanical sounds, colliding ships, wind, and crunching planets are all examples of invisible sounds in this film. The theme of glorifying honor, friendship, commitment, and bravery is something that all viewers can appreciate. Most people strive for these qualities in either themselves or the people in their lives. The producers of Star Trek not only hooked us with this theme, but they did a superb job using special visual and sound effects to drive home the point that much more."
"cuppa_tetleys","8","3","7","19 June 2011"," An extraordinary spectacle, visually stunning, otherwise uninspiring for a Star Trek virgin
","There seems to be a disparity in reception of this film between hard- core Star Trek fans. Half seems to think it's an incredibly faithful adaptation with fantastic action and lovable characters, the other half seem to think this works as a guidebook on 'Star-Trek-for-dummies', with writing and intellect far below the standard they have seen previously in the Star Trek series. I, however, have never seen Star Trek, nor have I held any interest in it, but I can honestly say that this film impressed me. <br/><br/>The setting was intriguing, the vulcans were extremely interesting and the characters were fun and likable. But lord almighty is this film beautiful. Everything from the Enterprise to the giant enemy space look absolutely astonishing, Star Trek boasts battles of epic proportions and (no other way to say it) badass aliens that look really cool. The direction and soundtrack are appropriate for the scale; action is reminiscent of the early Star Wars films, though seriously upgraded, orchestrated with booming percussion and high violin that might as well classify as space pornography. <br/><br/>The film however is not without fault; the writing, while good for an action film, may disappoint some fans looking for the intricate complexity of the science fiction, and didn't really draw me in all that much compared with the aesthetic. And while the characters are fun, I didn't really sympathise with any of them too much, though Spok especially seemed to possess an extremely deep and interesting race and back story that kind of got glossed over in the grand scheme of shooty space action. I was a bit disappointed myself; the Vulcans seemed fascinating and I would've liked to learn more about them, but we are only given the bare bones. I think, to me, none of the characters acted in a human way, which put me off somewhat, but that might be the entire point of an grandeur space opera, people go about things in a completely different manner. I just didn't see any real weakness in the characters that made me think them human. Spok briefly shows a crack in composure, but the entire nature of the vulcan people is to be calculating and logical, so he remains blank throughout the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The villains in this also perplexed me slightly, we are merely told of their motives and then they just pop up now and then, whenever they feel like it, it seems. Villains become better when we know more about them; it offers a kind of moral conflict in our minds when we sympathise with immoral motives. This isn't true of all villains (Dark Knight's Joker), but then the acting needs to be excellent and 3 dimensional, which it isn't here.<br/><br/>Any complaints I have are personal gripes, and even with them I can still highly recommend Star Trek, regardless of your Trek disposition."

It was the nonsensical and silly script that wrecked it for me.

","This is - and I am absolutely truthful here - the VERY FIRST movie I ever watched in my whole life where I felt so tricked, deceived and let up afterwards that I wanted my money back! Idiot me bought the DVD. It's up at Ebay now, I want it out of my house! If there was a zero star verdict, this one earned it. How could they?

If *I* wanted alternate universes I'd go watch Bladerunner, Alien, Dune, Star Wars, whatever, there are loads of those around - I don't need an alternate universe for Star Trek! I want Star Trek, when I invest money to watch Star Trek.<br/><br/>I neither liked this totally idiotic Kirk (I mean the original had its problems, but this one would get the Raiders of the Lost Ark-Treatment, a single bullet into the frontal lobe, to stop his awful mannerisms and he-man behaviour), nor the Spock who had nothing, but absolutely NOTHING left over from the early, timid and very much socially/emotionally challenged Spock of TOS. This guy here was, well, neglectable. Same goes for the new Uhura, who hasn't got a thimble full of the charisma and sex appeal of the original one.

"HuskyEnzo","5","3","7","26 April 2010"," Arrested Development
","I had very low expectations when the current ST-movie was announced and when I read, that it was meant to show the academy- and early years of the TOS-crew and ship.<br/><br/>And the point-of-critic still remains valid!<br/><br/>The makers and cast delivered a good SciFi movie. Nothing less and nothing more. That's all, folks. Throughout the entire time since the ""Next Generation"", even a blind could see that the execs in the company and the creative staff behind the whole franchise didn't have neither the guts nor the creative potential to evolve, cultivate and develop the franchise forward. That they completely lacked the pioneer's spirit which all ST-series ever pretended to cherish and portray. Thereby the Closing Argument by ""Q"" in ""All Good Things"" was *imho* always an adequate description of the entire franchise's problem as such, surely without any of the addressed executives noticing that. <br/><br/>What this film mainly suffers about is a problem, which already affected two ST-motion-pictures before: the first movie blatantly ripped-off the TV episode with that NOMAD-probe, for part two they revived Khan. Here the plot delivers an enemy-ship, reminding very much of that one in ""Nemesis"" and just like there the villain is on a vendetta against one of Enterprise's clueless senior-officers who doesn't even know of his opponents existence. The whole thing is a ""Dejà Vu"". For the climax the two main-heroes have to fight it out over there – again. Before the whole thing blows away - again.<br/><br/>At least they spared us too much idiotic technobabble this time. There's action, good lines, erotic and a logical predesign of the original Enterprise. Unfortunately it's predictable, that the makers will fall back to the old ""Patterns of a Dead Horse"" after this brief vitalization. But too many people don't want to hear about the Prime Directive anymore, about Klingon honor, technological bullshit, captain's doubts and constructed conscience-conflicts or about ensigns in their pubertous-prime whom the script don't allow to let themselves get laid. <br/><br/>I recall seeing the first three episodes of the last series 'Enterprise'. ""Aha... they dress it into a rock-song and think we'll buy it..."" Unfortunately that song sucked (Joss Whedon did better!). And again: the same lame dialogs, onedimensional characters (looking concerned all the time doesn't automatically mean good acting) and those crappy Star-Fleet-uniforms I can't bear to watch anymore. And just as ""Enterprise"", this movie also plays in the past and is the same foul compromise. So all in all this is giant leap back to where everyone has gone before. The only good point (apart of Zoe Saldana) is that they once and for the first time consequently showed, that messing with the timeline ends in irreversible mayhem that even the Enterprise can't fix anymore. But when I think that they only did this to restart an all new timeline with the old crew instead of creating new characters who are truly original and interesting I have to freak out. And you really don't wanna tell me that Janeway was an interesting character do you? That would be like selling Chancellor Angela Merkel as Michelle Obama and you don't really mean that.<br/><br/>This STAR TREK-movie is good and highly entertaining but it also reveals the still unsolved problem of the franchise and –guys at Paramount: you better get it going to the right direction. SciFi-franchises came and went, some better, some worse. Hell, even George Lucas screwed his own one up! <br/><br/>The best in last decade was surely the most short-running: ""Firefly""! There's none higher. Make it so.<br/><br/>That'd be all, dismissed!"

"GloriousGooner","7","3","7","29 March 2010"," Really Good Fun
","I found Star Trek surprisingly good, from start to finish it struck just the right balance between action set piece and character building exposition - telling its own unique story whilst at the same time establishing the well known crew of the USS Enterprise in their respective roles. The director does well with material that could so easily have been turned into a flashy fast pile of nonsense but rather he keeps it engaging and entertaining throughout. The actors put in some good performances too - with a young Bones and Spock having the mannerisms of their characters' original players down to an absolute tee. Part of me expected the usual needless love story that you tend to get in these sorts of blockbusters, or maybe a scene of blatantly contrived tear-jerking but there are none here. The fatty excess has been trimmed away perfectly leaving a really succulent effort to sink your teeth into."

","The only thing that really surprised me in this movie is that Spook didn't die to let James get the hottie. After all, she was the reason he got to save, not the town, not the nation, nor the world, but a pretty big part of the universe.<br/><br/>I guess the writer skipped that chapter in the ""Ten Easy Steps To Write a Hollywood Super Production"" pocket book.<br/><br/>But I'm sure there will be another episodes and Spook will have plenty of time to die.<br/><br/>So next time when you check the ratings of a movie, be sure to read the negative ones too, otherwise it could be the worse spent two hours of your week."

","This was neither horrible, nor was it that good either. I grew up, somewhat, watching the original series, and have seen a few of the movies, and what could have been a fairly decent account of how they all ended up on the same ship just did not cut it for me. I think we could have had a fairly decent movie, you know, how everyone ended up where they did (Enterprise) and some basic history on more than just Kirk and Spock, without so much falderal concerning some Romulan with a grudge against a Vulcan. Needed more about the hows and whys on that one; or I dozed through it. And portraying Kirk as some James Dean wannabe was a tad over the top for me. Though I did like the fact that the young Spock was ""getting some."" Lots of plot holes that needed to be filled, and about 30 minutes that could have been sliced too. But if you are a Die-Hard Trekkie, then you'll love this movie. If you are only a somewhat DHT then there will be some eye rolling, but for the most part you'll feel like you did not waste your time."
"Nola6015","5","3","7","5 December 2009"," A good Sci-Fi movie; but somewhat troubling to a true Trekker
","I gave this movie half of a perfect score because in the ranking I chose to rate it 50% for its quality as a good science fiction motion picture, (and it was every bit of that) and 50% for its fidelity to Star Trek--and I'm sorry to say that on this end, it came up with zero. I'm sure this won't be popular to those who champion the new set-up and inevitable ""change""; but I really don't care as this is about my view of a movie that alleges to be about the ""early days"" of Jim Kirk, and his colleagues, and their start into Starfleet history. That said, we who ""lived"" the ""five year mission"", and loved every bit of it, and the following movies--will have a hard time reconciling much of what is presented here, with our deeply etched convictions of what is, was, and must be! <br/><br/>Let's look at the two major areas with which I have issues hence the zero in the last five stars, for its failure to be ""true"" to Star Trek: 1.) Inconsistency with original series. I didn't like the tangentially suggested/implied romantic aura existing between Spock and Uhura--for inconsistency reasons ALONE. The Nichelle Nichols character never remotely displayed any interest whatsoever in Spock--it seemed she did like Sulu a bit, and certainly Kirk. On the other hand, her hostility toward Kirk is uncomfortably palpable. The Nichols character is a thoroughly likable, gentle, and professional individual. This Uhura seems to have a major chip on her shoulder. And yet, the only individual who, from the get-go definitely had a MAJOR crush on Spock was nurse Chapel—who was conspicuous by her absence. Then there was Chekov, who didn't even appear till season two, and there he is already in action--even under Pike's command. Spock's ""emotions"" are far to manifest in this movie from his ""illogical"" fisticuffs with the other boys, to his irrational hostility toward Kirk, and even with others--I found him a very unlikeable character. As to James Tiberius... Kirk's first deep space mission was NOT on the Enterprise under Christopher Pike, who, for whatever it's worth only served with Spock under him, never Kirk. However as a young officer, Kirk's first deep space mission WAS working under a Captain Garavic, on the USS Farragut. (See ""Obsession"" TOS) It would seem they have re-written the entire history of what transpired before Kirk ever came in contact with either Spock, or the Enterprise.<br/><br/>I concede this poses no problem for youngsters who never became avid Trekkies; but for those of us who bought up the novels (I have over 90) and have owned the series (TOS) since its first release in VHS-- well, these inconsistencies are as irksome as fingernails on a chalkboard! Yes, I realize time was altered with Nero's interposition on the scene; but this nevertheless makes the claim of this representing the ""early years"" somewhat meaningless. Chronologically it had several faux-pas as well, since the first episode with Kirk in charge of the enterprise (Where No Man Has Gone Before) had a stardate of 1300-something or other, and these are already in the 2200's.<br/><br/>2.) I did NOT like the destruction of Vulcan I thought the irreversibility of this event, and the subsequent ""fate"" of Amanda were irreconcilable with what we know transpires in later episodes of Star Trek, including the motion picture series—this kind of thing would have had a HUGE impact in irreversibly changing just about everything in the remainder of the Enterprise's missions. I guess there never would have been an ""Immunity Syndrome"" as there certainly would not have been a Vulcan crew; and as to ""Amok Time"" (a Hugo Award winner), -- forget it, no T'Pring, no T'pau,-- no Vulcan at all-- Spock would truly be in deep trouble. For heaven's sake they talk so much about things like the Prime Directive, and their devotion to NOT changing history--and yet this production utterly shatters TOS history. So much of what happened in TOS is rendered impossible with these events, that, as a bona-fide devotee of the Trekkie generation, I found it terribly unsettling--this could have/should have been a totally different sci-fi movie; but as presented, NOT ""Star Trek"". Otherwise, (as was the case in ST III The Search For Spock, they should have found a way through time, just as Nero did, or left some wiggle room to, perhaps in a sequel if necessary, reinstate the status quo—positively this was the biggest negative in the movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>As I'd already stated, it's not a bad sci-fi movie, it's a GOOD one. But as for being true to what became TOS, if fails miserably, hence I can give it none of the remaining stars as I grade it a total flop in that arena. The writers should have studied a bit more on important details of the past, and built their plot more around actual people and events already KNOWN from TOS--they could've done a bang up job with that; but as is the case in all too many hitchhike movies, they seem to think they can improve on the background and make a better story, completely disregarding what the ""faithful"" know.<br/><br/>They didn't! If you're not a Trekkie, well versed in the wonderful history therein contained--you'll enjoy a good sci-fi flick. If you're a die-hard devotee of ST TOS, and catch every inconsistency--you'll want to pull your hair out. I know I did! Nola6015"

","Disappointingly juvenile treatment and attempt to ""reboot"" the franchise. Several authors have commented about the cheesiness of the original series, but there was often more original ideas (until they started repeating themselves) in one of those 48 minute low budget TV episodes than in this entire film. The movie also has gaping plot holes and a time- travel aspect that is wholly unnecessary and a poor justification for bringing back Leonard Nimoy. The young actors aren't given much and they don't do much with the slight exception of Quinto's Spock. I thought Abram's writing in MI3 was excellent and I am a huge fan of ""Lost"" but he apparent ran out ideas when the deadline for this turkey came due.<br/><br/>PS: Who in world thought it would be a good idea to conjure a love triangle between Kirk, Uhura, and Spock?"

It is completely faithful to the original series and whenever a new character appeared on screen, I knew immediately who they were. The plot was kind of annoying in some ways but seeing the way everything looked and marveling at what a superb job Abrams did with the casting and all other aspects of the production just thrilled me. No wimpy captains here. Kirk is powerful and dynamic, though he has his faults.<br/><br/>I have long dreamed of directing some version of Star Trek myself.

Oh, it's got a character named ""Spock"" who has pointed ears and comes from a planet named ""Vulcan."" But the similarity between ""Spock"" and Spock is about what you'd get if a twelve-year-old watched a dozen TOS episodes, then tried to describe Spock to a grown-up director or writer who had never seen TOS. And ""Spock"" is the closest to the original of the main ensemble.<br/><br/>Okay, so it didn't _have_ to be the same, I know. But it captures _none_ of the original's feel or charm. Indeed, where it tries to do so, the film gets in its own way. To put them in the familiar setting and context of the commander/first-officer/doctor, the script has forced situation after forced situation calling upon the viewer to strain their willingness to disbelieve the absurd to its breaking point.<br/><br/>Also absent were any familiar sounds. But for a few, almost swamped, beeps and chords, most of the sound effects, and all of the score, again fail to connect us to the source material.<br/><br/>There were lots of exciting scenes, and I think this could have been a worthwhile entry into the sf genre of movies (but for that annoying habit the director has, as several others have noted, of shaking the camera for no apparent reason; actually gave me a mild headache, at one point). However, by calling it ""Star Trek,"" some reasonable expectations were cultivated. Alas, no reasonable expectations were met.<br/><br/>I'm sad to say it, but, although this movie is sure to spawn at least a couple of sequels, it's time to face the fact:<br/><br/>Star Trek is dead."

","I am a Trekkie, and my first impression from the previews was that Star Trek was going to be a flashy teen movie. The last trailer changed my mind. When Christopher Pike said, ""Your father was captain of a starship for 12 minutes. He saved 800 lives. I dare you to do better,"" I knew the movie had character and I knew I had to see it.<br/><br/>Character: The first seen, with the heartbreaking self-sacrificing heroics of George Kirk, had me on the verge of tears. I liked the subtle back stories to Bones and Scotty. It leaves a basis for much more depth into their characters. Spock's struggle with his humanity was done wonderfully. People can easily identify with the characters and the struggles in their lives.<br/><br/>Trek: Despite popular belief, this is a Star Trek movie. With a little more action than we are used to but it is a Star Trek. I wanted the pseudo science I had grown to love, and I got it, with the transwarp transportation (way cool), black holes, and time travel done well. It is actually my favorite time travel Star Trek ever. They rebooted the franchise with a perfectly acceptable Star Trek plot device, and with a stroke of writing genius, were able to keep cannon and do something new. Red Matter was a little bit hard to swallow, but dense dark matter would have been acceptable to me, so in the end I didn't mind. Besides red is easier to see against the ""dark"" colored background of space.<br/><br/>Fun: They poke fun in all the right places. The Red Shirt. Archer's dog. Bone's and Kirk were a funny duo. The Action was well paced and felt natural.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend this movie to fans and nonfans alike. Being a fan myself I loved it. This movie has saved Star Trek. It needed saving, it was dying. The past two movies were subpar and barely redeemed their budget. The last series was canceled. This movie will ensure that we will have Star Trek for a long time to come, and for that I am glad."

"gus120970","7","3","7","12 May 2009"," Rebooting the matinée
","Part and parcel of the PR bandwagon for 'Star Trek' were reports of Trekkers (a devotee corrected my previous use of the term 'Trekkie') weeping in the aisles, collapsing in ecstacy etc. at preview screenings. I suppose that's to be expected. It's been a long time since a movie featured the original characters and there was always something slightly antiseptic about the TNG cast and the movies spawned from their series. Such was the pre-release feedback from that constituency I was expecting to be blown away, rather than, as happened, leaving the cinema entertained and engaged, with slight nagging doubts. The most major of these is how cavalierly this reboot rewrites the entire Star Trek universe, details of which, of course, cannot be revealed. It also uses the laziest of sci-fi clichés in order to twist a plot around. When you see the movie you will understand instantly what I mean by this. Otherwise, it's most pleasant aspects are the rich, warm tones of its cinematography and retro stylings when it comes to the likes of uniforms, 'ray guns' and starship interiors which appear to feature copious amounts of pipework. This is as much a homage to an earlier generation of science fiction movies as to the original Star Trek TV series. One irritation is Abrams love of shaky camera work, which sometimes, when combined with overwhelming pyrotechnics makes it difficult to see what's actually going on. This is where JJ Abrams has fixed his vision. The reboot aims at recreating the intimacy of the TV series, dodging behind rocks and acrobatic hand-to-hand combat rather than the 'epic' and cerebral tone introduced by the movies of the 70s and 80s. Unfortunately the plot is not that strong. As in other recent 'reboots' of Batman and Superman, the initial exposition of story drags a little as characters are introduced. I have my doubts as to whether the actors are able to either inhabited these much-loved characters effectively and also give them new life. In this first movie, Spock and Kirk aside, perhaps, they seem to be pale imitations. Simon Pegg's Scotty, especially, was a disappointment. The thing about Star Trek is that it's such an assured franchise, the producers know they can refine and enrich their re-imagined ST universe over several more films, and this one gives them a relatively strong platform to do this from."

","For Star Trek fans ONLY. This movie is as visually stunning as it is stupid. Why? Simple: Time travel plots usually have holes large enough to drive a star ship through. This movie proves it.<br/><br/>In this case you have a planet blow up, Romulus. A Romulan captain with a very low IQ and a very powerful ship is plunged backward in time. He decides to kill everyone for destroying his planet. The problem: he's in the past so his planet isn't blown up yet. You'd think he'd want to phone home, warn the folks, maybe even contact the government and tell them what's on the menu in a century or so...but no: This guy has only one mission, to wait 25 years for Spock to show up, and then start the killing everyone in revenge for...uh...what hasn't actually happened. Even Spock seems to have forgotten that since Romulus isn't blown up yet, maybe he could have a chat, explain it, and everyone could go home happy. Nope...Spock has lost his marbles too. So now we have alternate reality Star Trek where EVERYTHING you've ever watched before now never happened even within the framework of fiction! What is worse, pompous scenery chewing Kirk has now become Kirk the young punk. Spock, sucks face in elevators, and Scotty doesn't wash. What a waste!"

","I have never seen any of the previous stories from the voyages of a legendary team of Starfleet, so this one was the first acquaintance with the brave space explorers. The one thing I know for sure after this is: I want to sign up for the service!<br/><br/>The reboot always leads to a new origin story, as in this case it's the second version, we haven't been beaten by countless repetitions like Batman or Spider-man, however, I cannot say that the start was in any way slow or boring. We get to know the characters pretty fast in order to create a special connection between them and then show some real progress towards the climax of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot grows on you easily and within minutes you feel like a genuine member of a crew. Following the menace we discover things that turn heads and drop jaws. The set of characters defined in the beginning is only a tip of an iceberg, so prepare yourself for a journey full of surprises.<br/><br/>The visual effects are great. Whether you are on the ground making a step on the land that has never seen a human, or speeding through space towards the pitch black mystery, you will always find yourself admiring the detailed and masterful setting of the scenes. And it is not just beautiful but meaningless surroundings. They are filled with dynamic action and clever dialogs. Furthermore it is topped with a fantastic soundtrack that makes your arm hair stand up while you tremble expecting something cool to happen.<br/><br/>Unless you hate science fiction packed with top shelf action and swore to eradicate every instance of it, you should definitely check out the movie."

","For the most part, this was a GREAT movie. I am a fan of the Original Star Trek, but not a fanatic. I do hope they will make a TV series from this movie. It is exciting to think of the possibilities, as the actors develop the characters from the original team. I wonder about the change in Spock's character, as that was an intrinsic part of the original series – it really takes something away by not having it. On the other hand, in my opinion, in the original series, the doctor overdid it somewhat on his emotional responses to Spock – this ""new"" doctor may be able to improve on that. I am disappointed in the relationship that Uhura and Spock have going – it is quite out of character for both people and for the series in general. One aspect of the original, that made is so good, was that the main characters didn't have a permanent on-going ""intimate"" relationship with someone, and never had that kind of relationship between themselves. It was the way that the characters related to each other and worked together that made the show such a success. Other points that factored into the success of the original Star Trek is the absence of sexual scenes and the near absence of profanity. I hope that high standard will continue to be upheld. Except for the one minor sex scene, in this new movie they did very well regarding those two aspects. I am impressed and pleased. Three cheers for the ones responsible for that. Please, please don't get sucked into using profanity, sex, and blood and gore, like most of the movies out there today. Thank you for doing such a good job on this comeback. Good luck with developing it into another fun, exciting series."

"chrisiomuk","10","5","15","14 May 2009"," Through the eyes of a young boy.......
","I remember watching Kirk, Spock and McCoy when I was a young boy sat on the carpet in our living room at the feet of my father, I loved it, every week it was a new tale of how the crew of the enterprise took on new dangers and met new races of people on strange planets. I remember vividly the Carbon based life form in one episode and the Tribbles that ate the poisonous grain giving away the sinister Klingon's dastardly plot in another but above all this, it was a tale about a group of friends dealing with each others emotions in different stressing circumstances and situations. This is something that was lost a little when The Next Generation came along, don't get me wrong though, I liked TNG a lot but it never impressed me as much as the original series mainly due to the fact that it centred to much on the technology and science behind what was going on rather than how it effected the people.<br/><br/>As the end credits started to roll on the new movie I couldn't stop a tear rolling down my cheek as all the memories of being a young boy watching the original series flooded back to me. I realised that the last 120 minutes I had witnessed had surpassed my expectations ten fold and that the actors had played their parts as the respective crew members perfectly, Karl Urban as 'Bones' probably my favourite re-visioning. Now Im sure the plot was fantastical and hard to believe for some people, yes, but then I cannot remember an episode of any star trek that wasn't a little silly, scientists are finding new ways to explain things every day so who is too say what can or cannot happen in this screwed up universe we call home you just need to have an open mind. All I can say is that Kirk sleeps with an alien woman, gets into a few fist fights and saves the day. Spock uses logic to explain things, argues with McCoy and wrestles with his human emotions and McCoy says 'Damn it' more than once and uses the word 'Vulcan' to address Spock instead of his name. Everything I remember from the series and following films.<br/><br/>I came out of the cinema feeling like I had not seen a new star trek movie but had actually seen a new extended episode of the original series and I have to say I will never be the same. Thank you J.J. Abrams and all the actors and crew who created this masterpiece."
"Meven_Stoffat","10","5","15","10 May 2009"," Who said they don't make 'em like they used to anymore?
","Now firstly, I was not a Trekkie before seeing this last night at the cinema in Digital projection. However though, the trailer looked amazing, and I remember watching the show on TV on the Space Network every morning before going to school. I also remember dressing up as Data from The Next Generation on TV.<br/><br/>Anyways, last night I saw this in a packed cinema with every single seat taken. We had gotten tickets in advance, and got to the theater early. Good thing we did- the lineup was longer than the great wall of China! We were lucky to get good seats too. And boy, we LOVED this movie! Anybody would like this movie, even people who don't like Star Trek. Hell, Even my sister who didn't like it loved it. There were even a lot of non-Trekkies in our theater, if I had to guess.<br/><br/>This movie is a reboot of the franchise, taking us back to the very beginning. We learn the origins of the characters Spock and James Tiberius Kirk, Kirk's bumbling misadventures at the Starfleet Academy, Spock and Kirk's rivalry, the Klingon, and much more.<br/><br/>The movie is flat out perfection in every sense of the word. The special effects are excellent, the visuals are breathtaking. Sometimes there are Camera flares (meaning light reflecting off the camera), adding to the ""beautifully shot"" feel of the movie. The action is top notch- The hand-held camera adds to the intensity of the scenes (don't worry, the camera doesn't shake all over the place, you can actually see what's going on). There's tons of humor too- Kirk is HILARIOUS, as well as there are tons of hilarious moments in this movie, including Kirk getting all the injections- now that was hilarious! The best thing about the film is the casting- Chris Pine is awesome as Kirk, and is really funny here. I was surprised to find out he played Darwin Tremor in Smokin' Aces too- he was hilarious in that one as well. Karl Urban as McCoy, John Cho as Hikaru Sulu, and the sexy Zoe Saldanha as Uhura is awesome too. Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty were hilarious too, Pegg was the PERFECT Scotty. Truly fit the quirkiness of the character.<br/><br/>But the real high point of the performances is Zachary Quinto as Spock. He plays Spock perfectly. The look, the tone of voice... he really IS Spock. He makes a lot of Spockish facial expressions throughout too, he's really Nimoy-esquire. Speaking of Leonard Nimoy, he's in the movie too! It was a great surprise to see the original Spock.<br/><br/>So in short, do NOT miss this while it's in the cinema. Abrams has really nailed it here. Well, I'm now a fan of Star Trek thanks to this movie! People applauded at the cinema when the movie was over. I was one of those people, in fact I even yelled ""YEAH!""."

","This new star trek film is an amazing achievement. On its own merits, it is a well made science fiction movie with great acting made easy by a good story and very well done special effects. It blends the real world of today with the possibilities of the future with seamless effectiveness. It is almost like reading a good Asimov sci-fi novel, but only come to life on the big screen. From the opening scene, it is clear that human emotion and interaction are central to the story, something missing from many of the sci-fi pictures being made. As to the fact that it is a star trek movie, the entire new cast is, in my opinion, just as good and true to the original crew. I have to say that Zachary Quinto, as Spock, was my favorite, it was truly a really good performance. But Karl Urban, as Bones, was the greatest surprise; I did not believe anyone could ever pull off playing Dr. McCoy, but he did with all the emotion, insight and fun. Most of the credit has to go to J.J. Abrams, he has put together a very smart, fast passedand cohesive film, the fact that he has also rejuvenated the best loved sci-fi entity in the universe is further testament to his achievement."

They all made and or changed things.<br/><br/>There are, no doubt, going to be purists that are offended by this movie. But they actually mention this in the movie - this IS an alternate future. It was changed when George Kirk was killed on the Kelvin. In the 25 years since that incident, our main characters have grown up differently.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>This is the most exciting reboot of any franchise that I've seen. I kept waiting for a break or a dull moment to get up and go get a refill on my pop and popcorn, figuring that somewhere along the lines it'd slow down. Never happened. My wife and I were both amazed at this movie - how Bones was still Bones, Scotty was still Scotty, and really the only thing that amazed her was Spock and ... Uhura? The cockiness of Jim Kirk - supergenius. Portrayed beautifully.<br/><br/>Considering that I'm a middle aged Star Trek fan that owns every episode of all the TV series, all the movies, and still has my original James Blish books and I do own a Bat'leth - (Okay, I'm a Trekkie) - I didn't want this movie to end. I want more."
"abecipriano","10","5","15","9 May 2009"," OMG! I ain't a Trekkie, but as a movie buff, this was an AWESOME re-boot
","I headed into this movie with relatively high expectations, because the trailers were awesome...<br/><br/>As the movie started, my wife, friends and I were treated to an awesome intro that reminds me of those cool James Bond intros in terms of impact... and it helps set-up the rest of the movie, and we eventually understand that it sets aside a series of events that makes it different from the original Star Trek crew's experiences as people (or Trekkies, I should say) know it.<br/><br/>After the intro, it was off to Star Trek Redux, as we saw how the principal players, James T. Kirk and Spock, as well as the rest of the original USS Enterprise crew, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, Bones and even Scotty later on, came together.<br/><br/>Generally, the storyline is quite excellent, the action and special effects were state of the art, and I think the director JJ Abrams paced it well while the actors were generally well cast. With exception for a scene or two with Karl Urban (Bones) when I felt he was overacting to simulate the character of Dr Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, all the cast members performed admirably in the shoes of their predecessors who began this quest in 1966. Chris Pine is a perfect impetuous and brave James T. Kirk, while he is opposed and complemented by Zachary Quinto, who is a very good selection as Spock (though he has sinister looks that remind me of his character Sylar on Heroes, like he was going to chop the top of your head off... hahaha). THe other actors also come together pretty well, Zoe Saldana as the long legged Uhura, Karl Urban as a serious and sometimes-not-intending-to-be funny, ""Run Fatboy Run's"" funny Simon Pegg, ""Harold and Kumar's"" John Cho, and a very young Chekov played by Anton Yelchin. Coolness.<br/><br/>The storyline, though complex at first glance, as there are time-space continuum (whatever) factors to it, allowed us to accept this re-boot, meaning there was logic to it. Though there are some elements that Trekkies will surely hate (a romantic thing that was not in the original series springs to mind), I hope that they forgive certain liberties taken by the new writers (JJ and his crew from Lost) as it is a worthy part of the Star Trek family. <br/><br/>I don't consider myself a hard core or even part-time Trekkie (though I grew up as a fan of Next Gen), but I believe this story will appeal to Trekkies, and non-Trekkies alike. As long as you love to watch movies and sci fi flicks, this is the story and movie for you. It left me with a good feeling after I finished the movie as it was simply awesome. I empathized with the crew as they experienced difficulties and also expressed feelings of triumph when they achieved success. <br/><br/>I am so looking forward to more Star Trek flicks to come. Lock in JJ Abrams for 5 more sequels, please! He's the best!<br/><br/>Enjoy you guys!"
"JoeB131","8","5","15","8 May 2009"," Better than I expected.
","I really went into Star Trek, not wanting to like it. <br/><br/>However, to give the devil his due, Abrams really did capture the essence of the characters, and even expands on some of them. <br/><br/>There's not a lot new here. We have time travel, we have a ranting Khan-like villain. We have the obligatory red shirt buying it. The characters do the things we expect them to do. In many ways, this is a ""the crew comes together film"" that the Original Series never had but all four sequel series inflicted upon us. <br/><br/>Let's evaluate the characters- <br/><br/>Chris Pine as Kirk. Actually, a pretty solid performance. He comes off as this rebellious guy who wins because he doesn't always play by the rules. He does the unexpected, he takes chances. You really believe he's a young Shatner. <br/><br/>Quinto as Spock- He actually had me convinced he was a younger Leonard Nimoy. (And the two actors together fit almost seamlessly.) He really recreates the mystique of Nimoy's original presentation and all the faux-Vulcans we've seen in subsequent series lacked. <br/><br/>Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy. He's actually pretty decent. If there's a fault, it's that we don't see more of him. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg as Scotty - Pegg is a great comic actor, and he brings that comic frustration to his version of Scotty. <br/><br/>The gal who played Uhura – Really pretty, they give her more depth and personality than she ever had in the series (as Spock's love interest, no less!) They make her a linguist, which gives her more to do than ""Hailing Frequencie Open."" <br/><br/>Bruce Davison as Christopher Pike- I hope that Admiral Pike appears in the sequels, I really like his character. <br/><br/>Now the ones that don't work so well- the guys who played Sulu and Chekov. Their characters were always interchangeable on the series, and here they were largely dispensable. <br/><br/>Eric Bana as Nero I think in some ways he's channeling Ricardo Montalban, but you never get the feeling he's into it. <br/><br/>SPOILER - There are things I didn't like, such as destroying Vulcan (and wiping out most Vulcans) and creating a separate time line where presumably, most of the Original Series, Next Generation and Deep Space Nine never happened. (On the brighter side, neither did Voyager! Enterprise appears to be part of the continuum, though!) I think Abrams felt he needed to up the ante, but I think he went to far on that plot point. <br/><br/>Some things are over the top. This new Enterprise is HUGE judging by the sets (which strikes me as impractical) and the Romulan Ship even bigger. (Seriously, why would a mining barge be armed like a dreadnought?) I think it suffers from Blockbuster Syndrome, where they do all these things that really shock and awe on the big screen, but won't look nearly as impressive the third time you've seen it on DVD. <br/><br/>Heroic or not, promoting Kirk from Cadet to Captain at the end? That seems, well, improbable."
"mhansen0207","10","5","15","8 May 2009"," So it Doesn't EXACTLY preserve canon, STILL A GREAT FILM
","As a hardcore Trekkie of 15 years (I own every movie and every season of every show), I was VERY skeptical when I heard Paramount was going to reboot the Original Series with new actors. I went into the film last night ready to dislike it if I feel it didn't live up to expectations.<br/><br/>Luckily, my fears were most DEFINITELY misplaced. J.J. Abrams's ""Star Trek"" is a roller coaster thrill of a ride that Trekkies and even NON-Trekkies are sure to enjoy.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away the plot of the film, but suffice it to say, it preserves the best parts of Original Series canon while introducing new twists and turns into Trek lore. I found myself not bored for a single second during this film, which is unique, as I feel there are parts in the other ""Trek"" films that seem to drag on and become a bit tedious.<br/><br/>The new cast SHINES in their roles, keeping the best characteristics of the original characters while making them their own. I especially enjoyed Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, and Karl Urban as McCoy. I would go in to more detail, but I encourage EVERYONE to go see this film for themselves. To the cast and crew, here's to a job WELL DONE.<br/><br/>So, while I was nervous at first, I can say with absolute certainty that ""Star Trek"" continues to live long and prosper.<br/><br/>You will NOT be disappointed."
"shiloo","6","5","15","8 May 2009"," Something different, good and bad
","Now I am confident that die-hard Trekkers for the most part hated this movie, simply because this truly is Star Trek remade.<br/><br/>What I don't like is that in some aspects, the movie, more so the script, seemed to appear like a no-effort script. The authors were lazy to implement a few things that ultimately are the core of Star Trek.<br/><br/>Among such things is to have a Spock character, whom I actually enjoyed a lot, who makes a believable torn-between two extremely different cultures personality, but as I read somewhere else, by concentrating on such fine and good character development, which I sometimes missed in the old Franchise, they kinda forgot some other things, like for example that this entire franchise is set in Space, rather than on Planets, with ships traveling in-between. This is not Star Wars, yet it sometimes felt like a less love-story-fantasy oriented version of it.<br/><br/>In short, the epicness was lost. Volcan got destroyed, for crying out loud! And that's it. There were six billion people on that planet, only 10000 Volcans survived, yet it felt like some random earthquake in a sparsely populated area. The only sense of what this truly meant, ironically comes from seeing the old Spock watching the destruction of his home planet.<br/><br/>No offense, but even when the (by human standards) uninhabited planet Genesis was destroyed in the Cinema 30 years ago, it was more epic. Destroying Vulcan looked like the destruction of some arid mining moon somewhere far away, where let say the enemy is testing his new killer weapon, but it looked like the real thing was yet to come.<br/><br/>The movie lacked (not always, but too often) calm, but grand pictures, showing the vastness of space, the eternal silence, and how small everything humane is. One could have almost forgotten this is after all a movie about space-going scientists and explorers - just without the space.<br/><br/>And because of the lack of such grand pictures, a more epic feeling for the destruction of one of the core planets of the federation was lost.<br/><br/>This Star Trek is small in horizon, it focuses on character development, which is nice, but what made Star Trek special, and allowed it to last for 40 years, the epicness, was lost.<br/><br/>I hope that the sequel to this new series will, after having taken the screen-time (and space) to focus on those (new) characters, give us epic pictures, and give some of this old Star Trek feeling back - which is what made Star Trek so vastly different from Star Wars, that could have easily played in a medieval kingdom, with Darth Sidius riding on a black horse.<br/><br/>It is most likely related to the fact that Mr. Abrams actually always liked Star Wars more, and is a specialist for TV shows. I like them all, but I am not convinced that his genius there was applied correctly with Star Trek. I should mention that I am the targeted age group for this movie, but what made me, or friends, watch Star Trek, was the optimism (it's there), the grandness of scale (missing) and that it was not fantasy oriented, but scientifically oriented (kinda there). Let's hope that Mr. Abrams doesn't make it into a soap-opera simply set in space, Star Trek above all is an utopia, where in fact we do not see realistic characters, but ideal characters in many ways, and where we get a feeling on how it would be to truly explore the infinite vastness of space. That is the Star Trek feeling, a unique feeling, please don't make it a Star Wars reloaded, Star Wars simply never quite had the scope of Star Trek.<br/><br/>I believe I should mention what I liked about this movie as well: it wasn't drowned in CGI-effects, something very important. It truly felt CGI was not the core concept (unlike in Star Wars) but simply a means necessary to tell the story. I really liked how some simply cheap and old stuff from the low budget series was most carefully redesigned, while making it still visible where it comes from. I don't mind the AppleStore design, in my opinion there is no reason why a futuristic utopia has to look like a cheap 60s low budget movie (as the original series was in terms of design). This is what I likely liked most, an excellent transition.<br/><br/>And together with some really good acting (after all, those are young kids, not yet the seasoned veterans we got to know in TOS and the movies) I believe all the issues I brought up, together with the good things I mentioned, means this can go very well if certain problems are corrected, or more focus is put on making it a Star Trek movie (without the 'canon' issues), Abrams will make this an excellent re-run.<br/><br/>I know he can do it, a lot of sensitivity was shown in production design, CGI and cast, so in terms of story, epicness and more 'space feeling', things definitely can be improved."
"troy-125","8","5","15","6 May 2009"," A little old, A LOT new...
","Saw the new ""Star Trek"" movie at the super secret World Premiere a few weeks back in Austin, Texas. Wrote an opinion for it immediately afterward for IMDb, but somehow my opinion never got published.<br/><br/>I will say that I am one of few dissenters on the crazy ""this is the best Trek ever"" bandwagon. That distinction belongs to ""Wrath of Khan"", for reasons that are myriad and don't really belong here. The new film is good, not great, but does accomplish a major task, which is to make the franchise fresh for new audiences.<br/><br/>Remember that Roddenberry's ""Trek"" was all about ideas: can mankind reach an enlightened state of existence, and tackle the universe's great mysteries (read: social allegory of the time) with intelligence and wisdom, instead of might and fight? For the most part, ""Trek"" has managed to embody more of the former, while giving us enough space battles and arch-nemesis' to keep the sci-fi action fans happy.<br/><br/>How does Abrams new movie marry these basic tenets of ""Star Trek""? It doesn't, opting for lightning-fast-action right out of the gate, and not stopping for a second to ponder anything of depth for its running time. Now, I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing - what it gives us a pretty cool sci-fi action movie, just not a true ""Trek"" movie.<br/><br/>Abrams may or may not have been the man to ultimately give this series new relevance. Only time (and sequels) will tell. Let's look at his casting choices, and how they fare. Pine as Kirk is passable - he neither defames the legacy nor elevates it. Much more interesting is Quinto as Spock. The script plays up Spock's inner battle between logic and emotion, and Quinto finds the right tone for this re-imaging (it doesn't hurt that the REAL Spock, Leonard Nimoy, shows up for inspiration. How the filmmakers manage that trick may upset your Trek sensibilities, depending, really, on how well you like the movie). Saldana's Uhura is soulful and intriguing, and Urban has got the right idea as Bones (but tell me you don't think of Hugh Jackman every time you see him). Let's hope we see more of him in the sequels. Sulu and Checkov, just like in the TV show, get little screen time or depth, and Pegg is funny as Scotty, but you're always aware that its Pegg, and not the character, making you laugh.<br/><br/>But finally, regardless of what you think of the casting choices, or the playing loose with the Trek universe rules, or the little things that don't seem quite right, the move suffers because of its lack of a strong villain - Bana's miffed Romulan is a snooze. Given hardly any screen time or back story, he's simply there to create a reason for the movie to be, instead of emerging seamless from the world of Trek itself.<br/><br/>And that may be what makes or breaks this for you. Sure, it's pretty rousing entertainment, but it's really not Roddenberry's universe anymore. And as such, things can come and go as they please to fit the needs of Abrams' vision. Whether or not it's a vision that can stand the test of time, like, oh, say ""Star Trek"", is a future-tense discussion."

I think anyone who shares that opinion will absolutely flip over this one; Roddenberry's katra is smiling down from wherever he rests in the celestial abode.<br/><br/>Casting and performances very, very good. Pine, at one point early on, delivered a smirk (or maybe it was a sneer) that was soooo Kirk; this was the role where my expectation for disappointment was the highest - I was not disappointed. I know Shatner was peeved at not having a part in this, but really he should be proud that the character he helped to create is so iconic that for someone else to recreate it requires learning some of his MORE . . . SUBTLE . . . mannerisms. Pine never ""Shatnered"" in delivery of his lines, but you still felt the connection.<br/><br/>Saldana in Nichelle Nichols role - yum yum in both cases. Bigger part in this than Uhura ever was in TOS, but hey, way OK by me. Funny (spoiler here) she has all these kissing scenes with Spock, where back in the real world of the 60's her big inter-racial kiss with Kirk was the big hoo-haa; to me, hilarious on the transporter pads where Kirk is looking over and going WTF? Urban absolutely NAILS McCoy. ""I'm a doctor, not a physicist!"" OK, we all knew it was coming. It was still perfect. Sulu's ""advanced fighting technique"" was (spoiler) fencing - cute, harking back to a couple of TOS episodes. But Sulu was never developed much as a character in TOS, he was just there firing phasers and whatnot, so Cho could not have done much wrong (I mean, unless he showed up non-Asian).<br/><br/>Yelchin, frankly, shouldn't even have been in this as Chekhov was not part of the first TOS season, but that can be forgiven in an alternate timeline (convenient SF concept, useful to explain away nearly anything). Pegg was consistently amusing, although it would have been better for the TOS purist had he asked for Scotch instead of a sandwich.<br/><br/>My only quibble is with Quinto, who delivered a fine performance . . . but his voice lacks the baritone ""Spockiness"" of younger Nimoy's. I mean seriously, to this day, when I see one of my kids flaking out when they should be doing homework, I drop my normal (already pretty low) voice an octave and say ""hmmm . . . strangely quiescent"" (a Spock line from TOS episode ""Operation: Annihilate"", first season). It only sounds right in Spock's octave . . .<br/><br/>OK script:genius; action:whooooo; pacing:bracing; drama:hey, it's Star Trek, not Hamlet"

","I was never really a big fan of the Star Trek series and the movies before this one and i was not intentionally going to see this film but i thought i would give it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of Star Trek. I thought it was acted superbly, i thought that Zachary Quinto was a very good Spock and i also found it good to see Simon Pegg in a movie as big as this. This movie gripped me from start to finish and has some very good action scenes such as when they land on the drill and have to destroy it. It also has a very interesting plot about how James T. Kirk became captain of the USS enterprise and how all the other characters get involved to the story. This is a very good movie i give it a very high rating and i will definitely be buying the DVD."
"Sanou_san","10","4","11","21 November 2009"," Cool, eventful, envisioned and re-established movie
","I've never been an avid follower of Star Trek nor Star Wars series. But I always remember when I was young how I got fascinated watching the older version of these movies in a defunct VHS format medias. I can't even remember the older version of the only Star Trek movie I've ever watched, but admittedly it was one of the best classic sci-fi films I've ever witnessed. I can tell that Star Trek has to have more lead compared to Star Wars. The latter considerably to be an entertaining film as well but Star Trek has the sharper phase and delightfully different attitude in its story. Forget to mention I didn't quite like much the remake of Star Wars, as how they were visualized and dramatized. I can clearly see the pale dramatization of characters in Star Wars than in Star Trek. This is the only variance I could see between the two. Though they undeniably equal in terms of effects, uniqueness of story and plot they have differences. At any rate, this fresh remake of Star Trek movie had got to be one you need to absolutely see. Chris Pine effectively characterized his role as the son of George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth), and Zachary Quinto had me reminisced a lot of his character as one of those Vulcan habitants. The story was also very much solidly established. I'm impressed how they managed to have such considerably effective paperwork of script to visualize this uncanny, heavy-effect sci-fi film. The crew certainly deserves a worth of a recognition and payroll for such job well done. I was enthralled and thrilled with the joyride of this film. The people, the acting crew had made their roles convincingly well and it is a great deal to be acquainted with their effort-full job. Eric Bana did get a grip of that antagonistic aura of a villain, somewhat confused, vengeful, cruel and honored. I consider this film to be a worthwhile choice of seeing over and over again."
"ClintWardley1","5","4","11","10 May 2009"," Great Movie but with one gaping plot hole.
","OK this my second review of this movie. The first time I wrote it straight after seeing it at the cinema, then later I watched it again when it was released on DVD. And then I thought what a turkey! After re-reading my first review I believe I was delusional. I must have hoped that the movie was going to be so good that it at first I had some sort of placebo effect. But seeing a second time I realized it was terrible. Three things make a good movie, the actors, the director, and the script. You can occasionally escape this trio if you get an inept director or a bad actor, but NEVER with a bad script.<br/><br/>The actors were good, they had to be to able translate this wham bang script to a believable level. The director, OK, he too, was good, but frankly he was in charge, couldn't he have looked the script and asked what high school kids were responsible for this.<br/><br/>The script, well it was almost religious text. That is because it was so holy. Plot holes galore.<br/><br/>Previously I used the term Wham Bam. That's what this was, all lights and sound, no content. The plot was ridiculous, every time they wrote themselves into corner they use techno babble to get themselves a freebie and trust me there was a lot of those. See ""intergalactic beaming to a starship at warp"" I have looked back on the writers previous efforts. Mediocrity springs to mind.<br/><br/>And finally it is uniquely obvious the writers and director have no idea of plausibility. They create such a plot holes that Nero's Star Ship could fly through.<br/><br/>How can Kirk possibly jump from Cadet to the Captain of Star Fleets newest Starship just because he did a great job. In the movie he was able to jump 6 levels of promotion. Spock who a Commander, 5 levels above the cadet happily handed over command? Why? Was it just Spock and Pike who were on board the Enterprise above the rank of Lieutenant? I am sure they have other Captains and Commanders in Star Fleet with the experience and seniority available.<br/><br/>I can imagine the scene in the Board of Review. ""We have 2 applicants for the new post of Captain. One guy has had 20 years of Service and has had 3 commands OR CADET Kirk with 3 years of recruit school, who has a history of fighting authority, has no experience with handling ships personnel but who, with the help of some other young recruits and a Commander with emotional issues saved Earth."" Gee lets pick Kirk, cause it's a movie."
"dddienst","4","4","11","9 May 2009"," A fun romp but it was NOT Star Trek and here is why.
","The main problem this movie has is that it violates the prime directive of time travel and doesn't even care. Star Trek established that if you go back in time and change something then every thing that happened and existed since then never happened. You might as well just trash all the old star trek movies and series because it never happened.<br/><br/>And I am supposed to believe that Spock the one person in the universe who understood the mechanics and the math of sling shot time travel would accept the destruction of Vulcan and 6 million of his people and all the repercussions that, that will have on the future with everything the Vulcan people did and invented in the universe. This is the pinnacle of absurdity!<br/><br/>What would have happened is Spock would have convinced Kirk that the time line needed to be corrected and his own father saved. They would have engaged the bad guy and recovered Spock's future ship then traveled back to the original disturbance and destroyed the bad guy again in the past saving Kirk's father and probably destroying the alternate future enterprise with Kirk in the battle. Time line restored. 6 million Vulcan's saved. Jump to actual time line Kirk graduating star fleet and being assigned to whatever ship he was on before the enterprise.<br/><br/>Spock of ALL people would not allow Vulcan to die in the past because in 200 years he will be 2 minutes too late to save Romulus in the actual time line. <br/><br/>Also I found the coincidental meeting of Kirk and Spock on the ice planet ridiculous and then the changing of all Star Trek cannon to claim the Scotty invented long range in transit teleportation when he did NOT even more absurd. He was dead by the second generation star trek episodes which had no such technology! Why would you do that since Spock is from the even farther future where the technology would have existed and Spock could have used it anyway without letting Scotty see or know future secrets. <br/><br/>I find it odd and amusing that Paramount would screw up star trek cannon and time line so terribly while the Star Trek fan films can keep it straight. Maybe paramount should have hired the people that make Star Trek: New Voyages to reboot the franchise?"

","I didn't much enjoy The Original Series with William Shatner, but I thought this film was brilliant.
How they devised the 'alternate reality' was ingenious as it leaves all of the original TV series' and films intact and is the writers way of nodding with respect to everything that had come before.<br/><br/>I think it allows people, like me, who did not grow up with The Original Series on TV to begin appreciating Star Trek where just watching Shatners series on DVD would not give the same energy as it had."
"Minerva_Meybridge","10","2","4","10 August 2017"," Excellent Movie, but Gaping Plot Hole
","The dialogue, the characters, the direction and special effects gave homage to the original cast and series. There was not one single moment that was dull. The film affected an alternate timeline when Nero destroyed the USS Kelvin, commanded by Captain George Kirk, the father of James T. Kirk.Nero is a Romulan, who for some odd reason, sent Spock to save his planet. Spock failed, but his attempt sent both Spock and the Nero's giant ship back close to 200 years in time. But rather than using the ""gift"" of time he has received to be able to save his planet and eventually rescue his wife and family, Nero spends his time idly plotting revenge against Spock.So, either Nero is a totally idiot, or the writers were. At least this could have been explained by having Nero's ship losing warp capability and throw to, say, near earth, so that he couldn't go back to save his planet. But that wasn't the case.It was also a bit of a stretch without explanation that when young Spock maroons Kirk on an arbitrary planet, it turns out to be the same planet that old Spock just happened to crash land on, and that same planet where Scotty has been stationed. That just reminds me of Bogart's line in Casablanca, ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."""

"mymtproject","3","2","4","24 November 2016"," Action packed movie with absurd, cartoonish characters
","Let me get this out of the way first - J.J. Abrams is not a good director. Period. I don't care that younger viewers enjoy watching his movies; he produces flashy bilge an nothing this guy has done since CLOVERFIELD is original, nor good. <br/><br/>Now let's get to J.J. Abrams's ""reimagined"" STAR TREK, which is full of unfunny homages (there's a hot, green lady on the bed) to characters who act completely out of character (see Spock with emotion impulse control issues, Uhura the pompous slut and Kirk the hotdogger who bumbles his way from one crisis to another and escapes by sheer luck). <br/><br/>The plot. Okay, ""Nero"" seems like a rather Earthy name but let's just run with it. Using the plot from the Next Generations movie NEMESIS, Nero has a supersized ship that all but wiped out an entire Federation fleet so he can get to Vulcan and destroy it using a big drill on a cord from his ship (why not just nuke the planet from space?) and then dropping a small black hole into the center of the planet. Check that off, Spock's home world destroyed and now ON TO EARTH, because we always have to include Earth in every damn Trek movie these days.<br/><br/>Nero's beef with Vulcan, Earth and the Federation? His world was destroyed when Spock from the original time line we knew in the original films (see great Trek movies like ST 2, 3 and 4) went back in time (more borrowing from earlier Trek movies) to save Nero's race (Romulus, which was also the planet of the bad guy from NEMESIS) from being annihilated by a Super Nova. Spock gets there too late to save Romulus and Nero's wife and children die in the planet ending explosion. Now since Spock had a time machine on a ship, couldn't he have just gone back again and gotten to Romulus earlier, before the explosion? The way the old Spock explains it to the newer, idiot Kirk never really makes sense. Anyhow, Nero gets a hold of time travel, goes back to wipe out EVERYONE since he can't have his family and race. <br/><br/>Along they way there are the intros to Scotty, Bones and other characters but you're still scratching your head trying to figure out WTF they are doing in this film. It feels like they threw a bunch of stuff together for a last-minute homework assignment, put some flashy space battles in along with groan inducing one-liners and said ""RUN WITH IT, THE PROLES WILL LAP IT UP!""<br/><br/>And people DID lap it up, calling it ""very cool"" and ""fun"" and ""action packed"" but nobody except longtime Trek fans and most semi-coherent adults saw what it was, overblown cinematic garbage.<br/><br/>The pinnacle of the absurdity of this movie is when Spock, as acting commander of the Enterprise, jettisons Kirk in a giant bubble down onto an ice world (hope he doesn't freeze, oh and that there is air to breathe down there) because he was a treat aboard the ship. Why not just lock him in a holding cell? I think they had those on the old Enterprise from the 1960's series. Ever heard of them? This moment gets more absurd because Kirk just happens to land on the one planet in the entire Universe (not Galaxy but Universe - see mathematical impossibility) where old Spock happens to be stranded. <br/><br/>Illogical, Confusing, Stupid. <br/><br/>This is not a new, exciting remake (unless you want all action, useless characters and no plot), this is shake in some old Trek movie ideas, get new actors/actresses with terrible lines and throw in a lot of lasers and explosions. The only reason it gets a 3 is because of the action. That's all about this movie can offer for the $9 you paid for it."
"vicroberts-14272","10","2","4","9 October 2016"," An artistic license to bold go where no one has gone before.
","May contain spoiler An artistic license to bold go where no one has gone before. J J Abrams reinvents the Star Trek movies by starting at the very beginning. It has the same in it that Star Trek fans aka ""Trekkie's"" have come to know and love. It gives people who are new to the movies as well as the ""Trekkie's"" a chance to get to know the characters and what makes them tick. In my opinion the casting for this movie was spot on. As the rebellious Kirk they casted Chris Pine, who has been in other movies like ""The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"" but really comes into his own in this movie and I don't think we have even seen the last of him in the Star Trek franchise. I can see why they have cast Zachary Quinto as the young Spock. He seems to have captured similar traits that we have come to be familiar with. Quinto hasn't really been in any main stream movies but I think that the Star Trek movies will really kick start his acting career. As for ""Scotty"" they cast none other than our very own Simon Pegg. We know him best from TV programs like ""Spaced"" and films like ""Shaun of the dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". Pegg brings his unique brand of comedy to the film. And we can't forget the late Leonard Nimoy as the old Spock, which I'm sure would have been nerve racking for the cast but especially Quinto. Due to the brilliant acting choices there was none of the over acting we saw from the likes of William Shatner in the original Star Trek Series. And now down to the movie. It has the right mixture of action, laughter, sorrow and pride. Both Kirk and Spock have had to overcome some disadvantages within the early years. Kirk was bought up in a single parent family after his farther died before Kirks life had even started and Spock having identity problems in his youth due to being half Vulcan and half human. But overcome it they did and both go on to enroll at the Starfleet academy. During their time at the academy an unlikely friendship forms between Spock and Kirk. The developing friendship only strengthens the story line which some critics have failed to see. In the first installment of the Star Trek movies a rebellious Kirk tries to live up to his farther legacy is forced to team up with the rational thinking Spock to try and prevent a time traveling, revengeful Romulan from destroying the Federation, but in doing so they get pay back for what has happened to their loved ones. But they wouldn't have teamed up if it wasn't for Bones (played by Karl Urban from Almost Human) getting him onto the enterprise by giving him a vaccine. But it would have happened faster if Kirk hadn't got himself kicked off the enterprise via teleportation, but in him doing so he got to meet up with Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) who helped him back onto the ship. During the movie thee maybe bits that will be a bit scary for younger children, but is a good movie for older children and teenagers to watch with their parents. This movie full of great one liners like ""I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!"" Which you can't help but say it in Scotty's accent. It is also nice to see in the future that they still have problems with speech recognition soft where and it is perfectly demonstrated when Chekov (played by Anton Yelchin) says ""Ensign Authorisation code: nine- five-wictor-wictor-two!"" with the computer replying Authorisation is not recognized. They ended they film with Spock Prime (and I keep on wanting to put Optimus Prime but that's a different movie) giving us the famous monologue ""Space; the final frontier. These are voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new lifeforms and new civilization; to boldly go where no one has gone before"" Don't get me wrong, I don't expect this film to be to everyone's taste, but with a 95% likability on Rotten Tomatoes the chances of you coming across someone who didn't enjoy it very unlikely. Some die-hard fans of the original movie Star Trek movie franchise have criticized the new film and J J Abrams for changing too much of the story. Stating that the new movie doesn't represent what they feel are the best bits of the old films. I personally feel that the new movie are better than the old. There is less rickety, wobbly stage set and the special effects has improved with the technology that is now available. I also believe that J J Abrams has breathed new life into the movie. Gives Abrams more of an artistic license in future movies."

It tells the thrilling and moving story of a grief-stricken young man who attempts to drown his sorrows in a sea of booze and loose women. However, the reappearance of the man who killed his father gives him the chance to grow up and prove he can be a true leader. <br/><br/>I still see you pointing that phaser at me: No, that has nothing to do with Star Trek. What makes this film such a great one is how it broadens a 43-year old franchise to a wider audience. It serves as a sequel, prequel, and reboot to the previous films, and is not only equally satisfying in all three categories, it is emotional and exciting and accessible enough to be enjoyed by someone who either didn't know Star Trek or didn't even like it. And I know you want to kill or stun me—and I don't want to push you over the edge—but time travel and alternate realities aren't new in Star Trek. Your classic Trek tropes are alive and well in this movie. This movie doesn't do anything except inject the franchise with a much needed dose of humor, excitement, heart, and visual grandeur that had been far too lacking in this franchise, for far too long.

"shane-vasik","3","2","4","16 January 2015"," I'm sorry, but I still don't like this film all that much..
","Firstly, it doesn't ""feel"" like Star Trek. Okay, okay, you've heard that before from other reviewers, but here's why it's important to some of us: Simply calling a sci-fi action flick ""Star Trek"" doesn't make it fitting of the universe it is built around. The ship in this movie reminded me of The Minority Report for some reason - all white with light blue displays had an intergalactic hospital feel about it. Spock making sarcastically predictable one-liners were so bad I gagged whilst others chuckled. And Kirk being a martial arts expert with a teenage angst attitude who never listens to the advice of his officers (even though he repeatedly asks for it) makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>Also, although I like Eric Bana, what's with a Romulan covered head to toe in tattoos? I never knew they inked up before. And, to this day, I still have no idea why he's so upset with Earth.<br/><br/>This did not feel like a movie about a Starfleet captain or crew in the 23rd century, at a time when we've evolved beyond our petty differences and practically created utopia on Earth. This felt like...well, just another sci-fi action flick, and a poor one at that. I actually liked all the TNG movies (yes, even Insurrection and especially Nemesis), but this left a bad taste in my mouth."
"Tyson14","10","2","4","29 July 2014"," A great action film in its own right
","So, I've something to tell you all; something not even some of my closest friends are aware of...I'm a MASSIVE Star Trek fan. I've seen pretty much every episode of Star Trek ever made, I've seen every film made (even the one where Kirk fights God!), and I could have a debate with any other Trekkie about who is the best captain (Janeway, naturally). However, in recent years, Star Trek was a franchise on its knees. Since the end of Enterprise in 2005, there was no Star Trek series on TV for the first time in 18 years and the last film, Nemesis, effectively signalled the end of the line for the Next Generation crew. What was to be done? Well step in Lost, Alias and Mission Impossible man J J Abrams to breathe life into the once great franchise. To paraphrase Spock: ""It's Star Trek Jim, but not as we know it.""<br/><br/>After the death of his father aboard the USS Kelvin, James T Kirk (Chris Pine) runs wild in his directionless life. Meanwhile, on Vulcan, Spock (Zachary Quinto) is ostracised due to his mixed Vulcan-human parentage. Both are headed for the USS Enterprise, both there is only room for one in the captain's chair.<br/><br/>Reinventing Star Trek was never going to be an easy job for J J Abrams and his team, as there was almost forty years of canon behind them. However, from the first frames of the new film, the Star Trek timeline has been completely torn apart, due to the premature death of George Kirk, James Kirk's father. Some fans have complained that this isn't 'real' Star Trek, but it gives the writers the opportunity to completely reinvent the franchise, both in this film and the inevitable sequels. This is an opportunity which Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman seize with both hands, with a major re-writing of the Trek universe occurring. All bets are off from this point onwards, which is what Star Trek needed, after having picky fans moaning for years that x couldn't have happened, as y had happened earlier, but this also affected z. Let the reinvention begin.<br/><br/>Despite this reinvention, the focus stays on the relationship between Kirk, the passionate human, and Spock, the logical Vulcan. Chris Pine is good as the cocky, self-assured, skirt- chasing Kirk. Although he doesn't have the same bizarre speech pattern as Shatner, when the words come from his mouth, you believe that he is James T Kirk. The way he holds him self is similar too, especially in a moment where he sits in the captain's chair with his fist under his chin, which is completely reminiscent of Shatner's Kirk. The superb performance though comes from Zachery Qunito as Spock. Not only does he have the advantage of already looking like Leonard Nemoy, there is a real belief that beneath the Vulcan exterior, there is a battle raging between the human and Vulcan aspects of his personality.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast put in strong performances as well. Zoe Saldana's Uhura finally has a story arc that Nichelle Nichols would have killed for, Simon Pegg's Scotty and Anton Yelchin's Chevok provide the comic relief, and John Cho's Sulu getting to take part in a pretty tense sword fight. The highlight amongst the supporting cast though is Karl Urban, as Leonard 'Bones' McCoy, who has mastered the mannerisms of the grumpy ship's doctor to perfection. More of him in the eventual sequel would be more than welcome.<br/><br/>Abrams has also succeeded in doing something no previous Trek did - Star Trek is now sexy. The original crew we ancient by the time they started making films, and by the time they made Nemesis, the Next Generation crew had too many wrinkles and expanding waistlines. In this film, the hem lines of the skirts are that little big higher, Kirk is caught in bed with a green alien, and the USS Enterprise is very much suited to the iPod generation. The film is also quick paced and action packed, with some fantastic special effects.<br/><br/>The Verdict Set expectations to stunning - thanks to J J Abrams, Star Trek will live long and prosper. Oh, and it made me cry...twice"
"angelicseven","10","2","4","12 September 2012"," Accepted by even non-Star Trek fans
","Possibly like any other long time Star Trek fan I couldn't help be skeptical and have my doubts. Only after having seen it I came away totally impressed. For once J.J. Abrams did to Star Trek what Burton did for Batman. The only thing I found difficult to get use to, even though it makes sense in an altered time-line, is the different look of the Enterprise. It looked like it not only had plastic surgery alteration but got bloated in some sections. I didn't care for Zachary Quinto as Spock when I saw how he didn't seem to properly regard Leonard Nimoy (Spock Prime) with due respect, as Chris Pine did so with William Shatner. He just didn't seem Spockian at all. I liked the rest of the cast members but had trouble recognizing Checkov and Scott. When it came to Nero yelling out, it seemed like they should of subtitled the movie 'The enemy whines like a baby again (for the 3rd time).' Anotherthing that bothered me is how Bruce Greenwood didn't look anything like the Pike we knew, even though he's a undoubtedly very good actor. Even if you're not a fan of Star Trek you will like this movie!"
"schuesseled","10","2","4","22 July 2012"," A Great alternative to the series.
","I'm a fan of many of the star trek series, I like the whole universe.<br/><br/>This film is great, it stands apart from the series in that, it's shorter, has better effects, is more action orientated. etc. Many would even claim it's not really star trek because they changed too much, blah blah.<br/><br/>I like that whole time travel resulting mess that this film uses as a basis for it's plot. Those who are expecting this guy to be the this and this species to be that, because they were in the series which for the most part are set after this film. Are in for a shock when everything gets changed around, making the plot intriguing and surprising.<br/><br/>Coupled together with stunning visual effects, the sound of the warp engine igniting is almost erotic and great acting from the cast, makes this one of the best movies to spend your money this decade."
"NewDivide1701","10","2","4","21 February 2012"," The future has a new lease
","As Captain Picard once said, ""Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown"".<br/><br/>One of the many great things about this movie is not only it has the concept of ""This is not your father's Star Trek"", while still being ""your father's Star Trek"". In short, J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is not a reboot, but the same old Star Trek pushed into unknown territory.<br/><br/>The movie is not one big homage to the original series, but flows with not only the original series, but the entire legacy as well. And as any good Star Trek film, or any good sequel/prequel/instalment, you don't need to know any of the other movies to understand it. What is even better that even with the alterations to the time line, much of what is known about Star Trek's legacy is still maintained, including the Kobyashi Maru scenario for example.<br/><br/>From a Trekkies point of view, that even the course of Star Trek history has been drastically changed, it doesn't have the ""screw the original series"" feel, but rather that we are now boldly going where no one has gone before, and what is to happen with Star Trek with these drastic historic changes. Sailing into the unknown.<br/><br/>Star Trek blends comedy, suspense and action perfectly, though it hardly give you time to breathe. Basically, the one scene from The Last Samurai where Tom Cruise took out 3 assassins at once and later the events caught up with him. This is the feeling you get from this movie at the end where it all finally comes together. With all that, it also has the same fantastic feel as did the original Star Trek did, making the old seem new again, and not betraying Star Trek at all.<br/><br/>The Enterprise I admit was a shock to see, but quickly came to accept it as the Enterprise, keeping it true to Walter ""Matt"" Jeffries original design, while re-envisioning the look of the 23rd century and keeping it true to Star Trek legacy. The design of the bridge, transporter room, everything, as though the designers have the technology to extract imagination directly out of imagination itself.<br/><br/>Onto the characters. Chris Pine's portrayal of James Tiberius Kirk (why he left it as James T.) is shown a someone who is very impulsive, cocky, and ready to use his fists, while at the same time showing his light hearted side and that sense of apprehension. In other words, exactly like James T. Kirk. He does not portray him as William Shatner did, but that would be more like a parody as shown many times over.<br/><br/>The case of the 2 Spock's, their performances are, I wouldn't say identical, rather they are almost indistinguishable from each other. Both Zachary Quinto who does a nice performance of the same old Spock we all know and love, and Leonard Nimoy able to go back to his famous role after 18 years.<br/><br/>Probably the best performance is Karl Urban as Doctor Leonard McCoy where he is not doing an impression of Deforest Kelley as McCoy, but that his performance is almost a dead ringer for that of Deforest.<br/><br/>Where in many science fiction stories where people are looking for survivors of a starship, planet, or apocalypse, this movie now can take a new approach of survivors of time. What path will they follow? Will this Star Trek be something completely new, or will it settle into much of what was your father's Star Trek?<br/><br/>And I had no trouble with the lens flare. It added character to the movie.<br/><br/>Altogether, this is by far the best Star Trek I have ever seen, and recommend it to both the fans and the non-fans. And I am willing to see where this will lead. And go into territory ... he he, where no one has gone before.<br/><br/>Give Star Trek ..... 10/10"

","Well recently I was involved in very hot dispute about the point of view and the meaning of two greatest ever sci-fi movies Star Trek and Star Wars. So some people often believes that Star Wars movies are charming very dramatic filled with amazing action scenes, love and all those gadgets and so on. With few words, what we have? There is big intergalactic space ships with big hallways and chambers operated by computers with big buttons like on my a year old nephew baby toys!?! Light sabers working in full absence of any course of nature. The list is gonna be too long, OK the story is good - A long time ago...wtf... that's why I would stop here. Star Trek - is our future!!! Every single part of that movie describes what we have before us. Every scientific element in Star Trek saga has a physic explanation and theoretically can be done. If still there is people wondering where's the difference well as long as Star Wars telling us story about our past Star Trek is leading us to our future. Regards!"
"sqeaston9","6","2","4","4 January 2012"," Terrible plot undermines what was otherwise good
","So Star Trek returns with it's most visually stunning outing to date. This movie looks great, with very nice sets, special effects, costumes and action set pieces.<br/><br/>Similarly, the casting is very good. Quinto is just perfect as Spock, and I found the choices made for the other characters fine as well. This was one of my biggest concerns for this reboot, so bravo! The story effectively creates a new reality for our characters, a major catastrophe means that this is effectively a different universe to Star Trek:TOS. I think this was probably for the best, freeing the writers from the constraints of the existing storyline. I know that many viewers object to this thinking it somehow invalidates other existing Star Trek franchises. It doesn't because it's a different reality. ST:TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager are real in their own universe and are as valid as ever.<br/><br/>But where the movie really falls down is the plot. There are many plot holes, ridiculous coincidences and incomprehensible decisions made by the characters. It seemed like the plot was simply created to string together the action set pieces regardless of how stupid it turned out. I can understand this being an action orientated movie, but I couldn't help but find myself regularly shaking my head at what I was seeing.<br/><br/>The plot is so poor it reduces what would have been 10/10 for a 'Wrath of Khan' quality plot to a mediocre 6/10. Please, more of the same for the next movie but write a decent story, or at least one that makes logical sense. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."

(Sulu is the only bad actor portrayal) SCOTTY is excellent!! love it!! THey do a great job in showing how Kirk evolves from childhood and where he gets his true grit. They throw in a few lines from the original TV series but not too many to make it cheesy. This movie cant be exactly like the original series which is just fine. YOu develop an admiration and feel a kinship to the new cast almost immediately. The special effects are awesome. In this age of Fake Looking CGI, there is none of the CGI garbage.

","If only more movies could be made like this I would be in sci-fi heaven. The movie goes beyond science fiction with an action packed pace, drama and comedy all thrown in with very likable timeless characters. Sometimes it all just comes together and it does in this movie. This is the only movie I have watched 10 plus times and still I'm not bored with it. One of the most important keys for me is an emotional connection YOU FEEL FOR THE CHARACTERS. From the initial gut wrenching decision to save wife and baby KIrk to Spocks dealing with planet destruction. Secondly BELIEVABLE story, intelligently written.. tying in new with the old. <br/><br/>I thought I would be watching the third sequel by now WHAT HAPPENED???<br/><br/>The director did an amazing job and brought the action, pace, emotional, believable to the screen to make this an epic DEFINING MOVIE of the Decade.."
"ppilf","3","2","4","22 March 2011"," just another B action movie
","Did not like this movie. Just a poor action thriller clone of the Star Wars fantasy opera, complete with finale hero award ceremony. Cowboys and Indians in outer space. Full of action and special effects, but juvenile with shallow characters that appeal to a 12 or 13 year old. But then the action movie industry audience is predominantly age 13 intelligence level. Movies like this are usually successful teen money makers. The special effects, and the Spock and Scottie characters just slightly salvage the film (to three points). The Bones character was embarrassingly obvious in his attempt to mimic Leonard McCoy of the original series. There are much better Star Trek films and series episodes."

","There's a lot I could write about this new version of Star Trek. But I'll keep this brief.<br/><br/>I'm not a Trekkie as such, but as a casual fan of The Original Series and the Star Trek movies with the original crew, this movie is a big disappointment.<br/><br/>I understand the need to usher in a new generation of crew members, new story lines, new technology and so forth. However Star Trek 2009 takes the quick and easy path for all of these. <br/><br/>It's painfully obvious from the first 10 minutes of this film that it is targeted squarely at teenagers and young adults. All semblance of an intelligent and intriguing plot or deep character development is absent. Even internal consistency is thrown out the window. Plot holes aplenty and a complete lack of adherence to the core ideas of Star Trek are visible at every turn.<br/><br/>Imagine Star Trek by Jerry Bruckheimer.

"imdbbl","Null","2","4","24 September 2009"," Just another big budget action film
","JJ Abrams last project is one of the most well known franchises out there,Star Trek.I have never seen the original show nor the movies. I only saw a couple of episodes from a 90's spin-off and I was very young. But I am well aware of how famous this franchise is and the huge following it has so I was curious to watch this. The film chronicles the early days of James T. Kirk and the rest of the USS Enterprise crew members... To be honest this is just another big budget action film.It creates an illusion of excitement by having people running around all the time and shooting weapons, gigantic ships firing lasers,black holes destroying planets and what not,but the truth is the story is weak,not that interesting and its been done before. The most interesting part in the movie is the time travel which serves as a plot device,that's something that is always pretty cool and obviously it raises certain questions about different realities and changing the past or the future and that is something that fascinates me. But, I did my research, and apparently time travel has been used several times in the previous movies of this franchise; and even worst then that is the fact that this exactly same plot device is being used RIGHT NOW in the TV show Lost(which I love), a project JJ Abrams is part of; talk about lack of creativity...there are also a few plot holes and clichÃ©s that contribute to the overall poor quality of this flick. Onto the acting, Zachary Quinto wasn't bad as Spock but I don't think this kind of role suits him very well,he's much more comfortable and more importantly,believable, for instance,as the crazy and psychotic Sylar in Heroes.Chris Pine was a pleasant surprise,good performance and, he carried the movie on his back.And then we have Leonard Nimoy with a not so small cameo,who's been doing this character over 40 years.I'm sure the fans were delighted to see him back. From the little I know I don't think the film honored the original show and it hasn't converted me as a fan either...<br/><br/>6/10"

"jephtha","7","0","0","24 February 2015"," Well made and promising, though it has room for improvement in terms of thrills
","Star Trek was the unexpected success of the 2009 summer season. It's not hard to understand the reason for this. As James Rolfe put it, ""it has a kick to it, which makes it more commercial than any Star Trek"". I can't help but wonder, though, if timing had something to do with its success. Much like how ""Godzilla 2000"" may not have been so well received were it not for the failure that preceded it, it's not difficult to suspect that this film may have garnered less praise had it not followed the divisive entries in a certain other franchise.<br/><br/>There is not much delivery on the promise to ""boldly go where no Star Trek has gone before"", which is something that Roger Ebert and James Berardinelli have already discussed far better than I can. This prevents this movie from truly being the groundbreaking project that a re-imagining can potentially be. Even so, there are many things that I admire about it. The style is noticeably different from any other space opera of its decade, granting a breeziness that is appropriate for a summer blockbuster. J.J. Abrams seems to have an apt for this genre, providing plenty of fast paced sequences and good scenery. It's not very often we get to see the Enterprise stationary upon land, where I believe it looks more impressive than in space. The performers are all competent given what they are aiming for, bolstered by some rather effective humor. However, it is somewhat disappointing that so many of them are underutilized. Most of them really amount to superficial updates of previous incarnations, which will not do much for the casual moviegoer. Kirk and Spock are the only substantial ones, though Spock is less successful due to giving the impression of a self-righteous teenager for much of the first half. Pine is suitably entertaining and arrogant as Kirk, managing to put a new spin on the familiar captain. Even so, I will say that, as far as an initial chapter is concerned, there is a much better effort at establishing the characters than there was in ""The Phantom Menace"".<br/><br/>Where ""Star Trek"" falls short of the Star Wars prequels, however, is in imagination and excitement, a comparison merited due to a style that veers closer to an action packed space opera than a traditional science fiction film. The special effects are all polished and mostly pleasant to look at, but lack that creative flair that made those other space operas so visually versatile. This can be seen in both the creatures and hardware. Aside from the iconic Enterprise, the space vessels are rather forgettable and fail to inspire awe from the viewer; the villains float around in what looks like a giant mutated pine-cone. The most creative ship is the one that contains the red matter and seems to have some type of gyroscopic structure, but compared to some of the other things seen in space operas in recent years it might as will be a wind-up toy. As for the creatures, consider that red thing on the snowy planet that Kirk is jettisoned to. It's definitely weird, but there's something disorganized and fleeting about it. The giant red angler fish and bio-luminescent eel from ""The Phantom Menace"" managed to leave a better impression. The biggest issue is the villain, Nero. While his motives are made clear, he's not built up as a very impressive threat, mostly because it is painfully obvious that without his ship he is just another guy with a grudge. Compared to the unnerving quality of the Borg and the craftiness of Khan, I don't see Nero looming in the minds of many following the closing credits.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is definitely a successful outing for the Star Trek franchise, which has suffered a rather bumpy road with its feature films. I recommend it for its entertaining characters, humor and sleek effects, all of which hopefully will be taken in a more interesting direction with its second sequel."
"alindsay-al","9","0","0","4 September 2014"," A Fantastic sci-fi that really surpassed my expectations
","To begin with I am not a Star Trek fan, I have never seen a full episode of the show or any of the films until this one. I must say I am incredibly impressed with this film and I am looking forward to all things Star Trek in the future, it just makes me wish the Star Wars prequels could have been anything like this film. This film documents James T Kirk's rise to the captain of the Enterprise and his relationship with half Vulcan Half Human Spock as they attempt to take on a force from the future. Now this film mainly features Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock and both of them are marvelous in their roles and the best part of this film is their relationship and the contrast of their ideals and character. Also the chemistry of the two is something that can be capitalized on and used for this franchise to grow. Now the supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag for me with Karl Urban and Zoe Saldana thriving in their roles as Dr McCoy and Uhura but there was also some negatives for me among the group with the Russian character and Simon Pegg's character scotty are both comic relief and I just wish their was only one comic relief character but it is a bit of a shame that their is two. Another negative character is that of the Villain Nero and while his reasoning behind his actions was good his character was weak and not worthy of being the villain in this film. The story is another great positive as I mentioned the relationship between Spock and Kirk was fantastic and also the use of time travel was a smart move for the story and also to keep fans of the originals happy. The script was really good and all the characters have great lines and the delivery of the lines is also top quality. Now with this film there is a certain controversy on the lens flair style but I love the style of this film as everything looks incredibly cool and it totally fits with this reboot. I absolutely love this film and I am now really looking forward to seeing the second film and more Star Trek films."

Nero fires on and cripples the Kelvin, then demands that its captain be beamed aboard. Before handing himself over, the captain transfers command to George Kirk, whose pregnant wife is about to give birth to the legendary James T. Kirk at any moment.

","Moment of honesty, I was never a Star Trek (1966-1969) fan growing up. In fact, when my brothers watched Next Generation in the living room I often walked out to play with my Matchbox Cars. I found the whole enterprise boring and later, when I wasn't completely lacking taste, I never sat down to watch any of the various series or movies. Ask me which I would prefer, I was solidly in the Star Wars (1977-2005) camp.<br/><br/>My introduction to Star Trek in all its glory didn't really start until I saw the teaser trailer for the 2009 movie. The teaser was simple; just a few close shots of the infamous Enterprise being built with heroic music swelling in the background. The whole thing felt like the beginnings of something colossal and I was actually a little excited for a movie whose expanded universe I knew little about. Once I actually saw the likes of Captain Kirk and Commander Spock on the big screen, my mind was absolutely torn asunder by the awesome ride that was Star Trek (2009).<br/><br/>The movie begins with a microcosm of what's to come; a universal anomaly, a spacecraft being blown to smithereens, high octane action and drama. The first five minutes has more emotional weight than most movie franchises, and it only goes up from there. We are introduced to the ensemble who all have their moments but the main story arcs concern Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto).<br/><br/>We see snippets of both their youths. Kirk grows up an intelligent, suave but angry young man who is coaxed by Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to join Starfleet. Meanwhile Spock grows up the product of two worlds; having a prominent Vulcan father and a human mother. He's teased in his youth for this very reason and thus becomes about as rebellious as a Vulcan can be by joining Starfleet. There the two meet and don't quite get along. They do however have a common enemy, Nero (Eric Bana) quixotically entitled ""the last Romulan Emperor"".<br/><br/>By the halfway mark Nero has taken loved ones from both protagonists and committed one horrible act of genocide. Despite this, the film accurately captures the zeitgeist of the original series. It's a hopeful film about people at the pinnacle of human and alien understanding trying to gain even better insights into the universe. A film about explorers who go where no man has gone before and stop evil from grabbing hold in the cosmos.<br/><br/>See, I know this because after watching Star Trek, I went back to the well to not only see the original cast in the show but the movies as well. In addition I went and watched a few episodes of Next Generation and even became friends with George Takei on Facebook. There is a reason why Star Trek is one of the longest running franchises in history and its not just fan boy love.<br/><br/>It's because each generation has left its mark on the franchise while staying true to Gene Roddenberry's spirit. The newest Star Trek crew are clever, energetic, and youthful. The Enterprise ship has the look and feel of an Apple Store with an external dampener, and the movie has slightly more pomp and circumstance than the films before it.<br/><br/>Or after it; Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) while action-packed, wasn't nearly as original or interesting. It certainly doesn't approach the gold standard of Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan (1982). Nor does it reach the stars quite like the 2009 reboot. Here's to hoping J.J. Abrams has a few more tricks up his sleeve.<br/><br/>Its funny how we can be introduced to new things; or rather old things we previously had no interest in. I was introduced to Wagner through the Bugs Bunny short What's Opera Doc? (1957). Who knew that Elmer Fudd singing a parody of the opening passage from Act Three of Die Walkure would be so enduring and cultivate an interest in opera. Star Trek is similar in my mind. It may not be the real McCoy, and to many it's not the best version of Star Trek's reality. But to me it's the gatekeeper to a brave new world.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

","It was a very fun and entertaining film, a worthy successor to the Star Trek lineage. J. J. Abrams was slick by creating an alternate Star Trek time line. This way he can escape having to deal with fitting the story Into the history for the past 40 years; and, avoids being burned at the stake by millions of fans if he gets it wrong. There were many things kept from the Original that I appreciated being there. The uniforms,and the Kobayashi Maru test as well as sound effects from the past made it feel comfortable on this very modern version of the ship. The actors payed attention when they delivered the iconic lines for each character and made the delivery feel organic. All in all a very smart and colorful retelling of the story.

","I'm not really much of a Star Trek fan (I saw like one season of TNG and some of the movies), but hot damn was this movie badass. During one of the worst summer movie seasons in cinematic history (2009) Star Trek came out and blew audiences and critics away, and for very good reason. It is one of the best summer movies ever and if you call yourself a fan of sci-fi you must see this, and if you love a fun action movie you must see this. Star Trek rewrites the history of the franchise, with a Romulan named Nero going back in time and killing Kirk's father. Nero disappears for a couple decades, but then he returns to finish what he started. The story is so well told and it is incredibly well paced. It truly is the shining example of everything a sci-fi script should encompass, it has great dialogue, good humor, shocking plot twist, and a slam-bang conclusion. It also uses the series mythology well, remember in the old show how Mr.Sulu would just sit on a console? Well now, he is a kickass sword fighter. Aurora is now a super genius, and Bones is just awesome. Hell, I hold this script on par with that of Iron Man. The action in Star Trek is everything I wanted it to be: Constant, well shot, well edited, and is extremely pretty to look at. But what I loved even more than the action and script, was the acting. Chris Pine nails it as Kirk, and the guy who played Spock is perfect in his role, whenever these two are on screen they steal the show. The whole cast does terrific jobs with their roles, and they truly bring these characters to life once again. Star Trek is exactly what summer blockbusters are supposed to be: Well written, gorgeous looking, action packed, smart, beautifully acted, sexy, and insanely fun."

","This was a great SF movie, but i can't give it more than 7 stars. It means it was entertaining, kept my attention without any idle running but was not THAT memorable. However, it was nothing more than an excellent action-packed SF movie.<br/><br/>The plot is good and the actors well chosen. Some of them are even resembling the original cast with a cameo appearance of the original Mr. Spock.<br/><br/>But the most important thing is that Star Trek fulfills it's purpose.

","It's official. I like it. I'll give it an A- or 8/10 stars. I was proper mad when I found out they were going to rearrange the time-honored timeline...destroy planet Vulcan?! Kill off Spock's beloved human mother?! Have Uhura be Spock's girlfriend?! <br/><br/>BEWARE: MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!!<br/><br/>Now I know what to do. Whenever I decide to have a Trek-a-thon of movies and shows, I'll watch the old stuff first, chronologically...Enterprise, TOS, TAS, and the first 6 films with the TOS cast. From there, I'll choose to either watch the Next Gen and its films, followed by DS9 and Voyager, or I'll insert these 2 JJ Abrams movies in right after THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Either way, all it is is an alternate timeline, alternate reality. In the future, Spock gets on the bad side of a ""very disturbed Romulan"" named Nero. Older Spock (Leonard Nimoy yay! :D ) ends up going back to the date of Kirk's birth where he witnesses Nero completely rearrange the original reality. Kirk's Dad is supposed to have lived to see his son's accomplishments in StarFleet, but instead he is killed just moments after baby Jim is born. In the new reality, Spock is the designer of the Kobayashi Maru test. (In THE WRATH OF KHAN, the dying Spock declares, ""I never took the KM...what do you think of my solution?"") In the new reality, we have a troubled, immature Kirk whose Dad was never in his life instead of the Kirk we're accustomed to. A little ""Tom Cruise-ism"" has been liberally applied. How many times has the Tomster played arrogant, childish twirps who have to overcome something and live up to Daddy's legacy? Even the APPLE during the simulation of the Kobayashi Maru...remember A FEW GOOD MEN????!!! LOL<br/><br/>Sure, I gripe. But I'm not a purist. I ended up really liking this new film in spite of being sure I'd hate it. Chris Pine's Kirk grows up fast, thank God, and becomes much more likable as the film progresses. Zachary Quinto (Is it KEEN-TO? Or QUINN-TO? Sorry if I've butchered it before!) makes a wonderful Spock, and has great chemistry with Pine. Both of them pay great homage to Shatner and Nimoy, and even though I didn't see it before, Pine has been able to channel Shatner's vibe. I'm on the Spirk bandwagon too. Now whenever I look at pictures of Pine and Quinto or the young Shatner and Nimoy, one word comes to mind: T'hy'la...Soul Mate :) Surely I'm not alone in believing that by the 23rd century, the New Civil Rights battle will have been resolved, and people will be evolved enough to accept same-sex relationships. One can hope!<br/><br/>I adore the new Bones (Karl Urban) and the new Sulu (John Cho) is very cool. The new Chekov is wonderful too...Anton Yelchin is one of the best actors out there...perfect choice! I'm sorry...I have no issue with Zoe Saldana, but the new Uhura was really dull compared with the original, and I'm not just saying that because a pairing between her and Spock is not only illogical but BORING! And speaking of boring, they really have gall when they say Nero was a better villain than Kruge, or Shinzon, or Ruafo, or Tolian Soran. Nero is BORING. The only thing that kept him afloat as a villain were the horrifying special effects (black hole eating Vulcan) and that huge, ugly ship of his! ""It did happen! Don't tell me it didn't happen! I saw it happen! Don't tell me it didn't happen!"" Oh puh-leeze! Nero is THE most forgettable villain.<br/><br/>Still sounds like I hated it? Nope, not even with the terribly borrowed concept of ""parasitic creature who will make you talk!"" Ripped right from WRATH OF KHAN. The story overall is very engaging (even when Kirk is ejected from the Enterprise and ends up on ""Hoth"" with the same crab creature who terrorized Anakin and Padme in ATTACK OF THE CLONES! LOL) and most of the cast are really great and give enthusiastic performances, including Bruce Greenwood as Capt. Pike. At the conclusion of this first foray into a new timeline, Kirk and Spock will begin their long friendship (and t'hy'la-ship too, if only in my imagination!) aboard the Enterprise. I am already 99.9999% sure I'll love Benedict Cumberbatch in the sequel to this film. Whether or not I love the film INTO DARKNESS remains to be seen. But I probably will. In spite of the dozens of complaints I've made about this prequel, I enjoy the crap out of it!!!"

","Thanks to this film, the world not only came to receive the franchise ""Star Trek"" back in style, but also received J.J. Abrams.<br/><br/>""Star Trek"" is the great return of the famous and most successful franchise back into the 7th great art, all thanks to the nerd J.J. Abrams. When Abrams promised to bring-it back the saga he promised that not only would be loyal to the predecessor's movies and series but also be loyal to all movie fans. With this he meant pure entertainment, and managed to be on the largest possible magnitude.<br/><br/>The story of J.J. Abram's Star Trek is half remake and half prequel, working perfectly. Everything starts with the birth of Kirk (Chris Pine) and follows up to his big arrival to captain of the Enterprise and the union with the unforgettable crew, but here enters the mix between prequel and remake. But instead of following the line of actual events of the normal series, everything changes when the cruel Nero (Eric Bana) appears and destroys the ship with Kirk's father inside (which never happened in the original series because Kirk grew up with his father).<br/><br/>Many fans may start to take this wrong, but everything changes when Kirk, after series of events, meets the ""future Spock"" (Leonard Nimoy), which the ""present Spock"" is played by Zachary Quinto, Spock is a Vulcan (beings of high intelligence and pointed ears), both Kirk and Spock don't really get along fine. But the future Spock treats him as a friend, and reveals terrifying secrets of the future related to Nero, which will bring serious dangers to the whole galaxy.<br/><br/>J.J. alongside with the screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman managed while being original and at the same time loyal to the original saga with an genius way. The direction of J.J. delivers stunning visuals and gets us through each scene and within the Enterprise (totally magnificent). Not only is super loyal to the saga but also manages to deliver pure entertainment filling the film with great action sequences. But for the movie work and be memorable enough it needed to have a great cast that could manage to incorporate their characters in the greatest perfection, something that didn't miss at all on this film.<br/><br/>Each one in the cast does a terrific job in his characters; Chris Pine delivers and makes his Kirk so memorable and Zachary with his unforgettable Spock. Both characters are very well explored and their friendly relationship between the two as well. Not only them but Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Karl Urban (Bones), Simon Pegg (Scotty), John Cho (Sulu), Anton Yelchin (Chekov), all excellent as Eric Bana, despite his villain not be very memorable and explored .<br/><br/>Probably the best prequel ever made, super loyal to the original saga, a stunning direction and a superb cast with a amazing chemistry. While delivering pure entertainment and can bring new fans to the saga, and definitely be the best of J.J. (at least until ""Into Darkness"") and his grand entrance to the cinema with one of the best ""Star Treks"" and one of the best movies with sci-fis action adventure ever made. 9/10"
"WKYanks","9","0","0","3 May 2013"," Better than I was anticipating.
","I haven't had an ""anticipation buzz"" like this waiting to see a movie since TMP. I was primed and ready to go with an open mind. I had read ""countdown"" before I watched it.<br/><br/>I've been saying all along ""it all depends on the story"" I think they pulled of the necessary ""transition"" very well. Those comments from JJ... ""this is not a movie for Trek fans"" was hog wash. This entire movie was crafted in respect for trek canon, albeit they intended launch it in a new direction. That was obvious to me as I watched it. They did pay attention to detail in their effort to take these characters into a new time. They had to ""know"" what these characters were to us. Bravo!! The good: Casting. Wow, all were just perfect in my book.<br/><br/>Nero: The only casting and performance that was not good. Not impressed, the story was weak. 25 years in wait? ...but we won't see him again, so nothing lost really.<br/><br/>I'm so relieved that we now have these actors playing our beloved TOS characters.<br/><br/>Sound effects: Caught a couple ""Star Wars"" sounds. Spock's ship with the red matter sounded like Annikan's racer. Again and again throughout the movie we were treated with sounds from TOS. This is something that ""new fans"" might not appreciate, but I took notice and really appreciated the detail.<br/><br/>The story: I'm a little surprised with my reaction here. ""it all depends on the story"" I said time and time again. I think I was wrong; the story was pretty weak I thought. Especially if you hadn't read Countdown beforehand. It was just another ""Save Earth"" storyline. What surprises me is it perfectly accomplished the goal I think. It was a vehicle to reintroduce our beloved characters in a new light. So while even Vulcan being destroyed did seem to resonate with me like I thought it might, the ""story"" wasn't what made this move good; it was how it was crafted to accomplish the goal.<br/><br/>Our new 1701: To start, it's apparent to me that 1701 will not be portrayed as a beloved character as it was before. They didn't ""present"" it like I thought they might (or I was hoping). 1701 was as much a character to me as Kirk and Spock were in TOS, so I was a little let down here. The exterior look was fine I thought. I'm not a fan of the bridge. It is too bright and the lights were too strong I think. The shape of the Captains chair was a nice nod to good old 1701 though. Where I was most disappointed was Engineering. WTF - really. It looks like a freaking building. Maybe it will take better shape as we get a few more movies, but I'm not a fan of Scotties baby looking like the inside of a paper-mill. I'm also not a huge fan of multiple ""guns"" and launching points of what looks like ""flares"". Trek star-ships have always been unique in the sci-fi realm with regard to their offensive weapons. This is a change I'm not fond of. I suppose it will have to grow on me. Maybe just another way to bring in a ""new generation"".<br/><br/>Music: Initially I didn't take to Michael Gucciano's score, but it definitely has grown on me. Enterprising Young Men is awesome and I did enjoy the ending music.<br/><br/>To summarize, I'll give this movie a 8 out of 10 solely riding on the casting and performance of the characters. Maybe that was their intent all along with this movie. I think they did what they needed to do; they gave us our characters back so we will long to see them again. I didn't honestly think that was possible. When I first heard of this movie and what they were planning, I was angry, ""Shatner is Kirk!!, Nimoy is Spock!!"", etc... I said time and time again. I am both surprised and pleased that they have changed my mind. Someone else can play these characters and most importantly I think, they can play these characters with respect for our original ones. The biggest plus for this movie was, not to sound corny here but, it's ""fun"" again. Humor throughout the movie in a positive light. Not ""forced"", but from a Trekkie's heart I thought. The audience time and time again erupted in laughter, young and old alike. Above all, this movie was ""fun""; something I think the other movies, aside from Data's classic lines and an occasional Worf quickie, had lost since TVH. This movie was most obviously crafted to bring us old Trekkie's along for the ride, and this Star Trek fan is most appreciative.<br/><br/>So JJ, cut down on the lens flares and shaky cam and upgrade Budineering and everything will be alright."
"SomeCreepinaVan","7","0","0","30 April 2013"," boring plot
","6/10 <br/><br/>The biggest problems I had with Star trek was the plot and pacing. The Its a typical revenge story which is boring. The pacing also felt off. The pacing feels rushed after the crew boards the Enterprise,almost like a new film. <br/><br/>This is how JJ Abrams tries to create an upbeat energy filled film, for which I give him credit for, but the beginning was too short and slow for this to work. I've never liked the pacing in his films. The beginnings always feel too slow, and the character development feels artificial. In MI3 we get Tom Cruise at a house party. In Super 8 we get random kid scenes that add nothing to the plot.<br/><br/>The villains shows no intelligence and were a real weak point in the film.<br/><br/>The Kirk/Spock kid scenes felt unneeded except for the car chase scene with Kirk.<br/><br/>The relationship with Uhura and Spock felt unprofessional. Uhura always messed with Spocky boy in the original series so maybe thats were they got it from. She would ask Spock ""Do you think I'm beautiful while touching his ear. I took it as she was amused by Spock's reaction. I get it Uhura's sexy but come on, too much happens after the crews gets on the ship."
"TheNorthernMonkee","9","0","0","16 April 2013"," How a reboot can/should be done
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>There's an article referenced on IMDb from 2006 called ""Spaced Out: Re- Booting Star Trek"". Written by Bryce Zabel, he talks about the concept of re-booting a series now only 3 years off it's 50th anniversary. The Crew of the USS Enterprise, first hitting our TV Screens on September 8th 1966. <br/><br/>Well, saying ""our"" screens, my Mother would've been 15 at the time of premier, my Dad 14. It would be a further 16 years until I entered this world, and a further 5 years and the Premier of the Next Generation for my first discovery of Star Trek, and a love affair that would last for the rest of my childhood and most of my Adult life.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to case in point.<br/><br/>Zabel, like many others had a dream of bringing back a series and developing it into something new, something fresh.<br/><br/>Everyone in this life dreams of telling their own side to every story. Gathering the memories of life and taking them in a fabulous new direction.<br/><br/>Star Trek would eventually find this new life, this (to steal from another recently, successfully rebooted series) regeneration. It would find it thanks to the tender love and care of one of it's own fans.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams, the man behind Lost, Alias and countless other hit series/movies, took hold of Star Trek and reinvigorated it.<br/><br/>After Jean Luc Picard's final outing on the big screen in 2002, Star Trek was flat out cold. <br/><br/>Personally, I'd never had a problem with the final film Nemesis, and a review written on IMDb way back in 2003 by yours truly (yes I'm referencing myself from 10 years ago, and no I don't care) showed that whilst at the time I enjoyed it, it never finished the series off properly. Admittedly the idea of the time whereby all surviving characters from the Next Generation, Deep Space 9 & Voyager would fight to the Death against an enemy (I even started writing a script where DS9 is blown up within the first 5 minutes) was a little far fetched, I honestly thought there was life in the series. The box office, and most other fans/pundits/critics felt differently. Star Trek was effectively KO'ed.<br/><br/>This meant that when Abrams got his hand on the series, there must surely have been only one option? A mainstay of Hollywood commercialism, a prequel.<br/><br/>At the time I shuddered and wondered how it could even work. A prequel is fixed within a universe, a point in time. Heroes shown as their younger selves, they cannot be changed, they cannot be written.<br/><br/>A character's life is written in scripts/novels and cannot be changed. So how can a prequel be anything other than a attempt to recapture youth and recapture a former glory?<br/><br/>Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, writers of this film find the only way possible. To create a prequel, to recapture the old heroes of your youth, whilst simultaneously telling a fresh and original story, there's only one way to do it. You need to make it 100% crystal clear that you are effectively creating an entirely new world, a parallel to the world of our dreams and memories. A place where anything can happen, and facts can be manipulated.<br/><br/>This Back To The Future style alternative reality, it allows for an entirely new future to develop. One where the characters can change and personalities rewritten.<br/><br/>Should a key actor quit, the story can accommodate this. Should they choose to blow something up, again, this is acceptable.<br/><br/>What makes the whole concept of these films so wonderful is that they ARE able to do this. The shock value in this movie of destroying Vulcan, the pure genius of this move, it is breathtaking, it is wonderful.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that there aren't tributes within the film to the original. The throw away lines to series, the introduction of nicknames like Bones and Scotty, they all add to the wonderful effect.<br/><br/>Include some superb (but not ground breaking) special effects, and the story takes on a life of it's own.<br/><br/>The acting is average, but acceptable, all actors mimicking the originals to varying degrees of acceptance. Karl Urban deserving special praise for his Leonard McCoy.<br/><br/>The film captures the mood effectively and does exactly what you'd expect really. It moves and enthrals. It makes you laugh, and it makes you think of days gone by. As a tribute it is superb, and as a fresh start, it is a masterstroke.<br/><br/>The sequel is due within the next month, and personally, there's a thrill and an expectation. Star Trek is firmly back where it belongs.<br/><br/>Bibliography Re-booting Star Trek by Bryce Zabel - http://bztv.typepad.com/newsviews/2006/06/spaced_out_star.html"
"OrionSiriusSagan","9","0","0","26 March 2013"," This is a great way for Star Trek to reboot
","I enjoyed this JJ Abrams reboot of the glorious Star Trek franchise and the villain in this movie even from the trailer instantly reminded me of Titan AE. The Titan AE-like antagonist in this movie is a bald Romulan commander named Nero and as it turns out he wants revenge for the loss of his planet Romulus and sets out to destroy UFP planets for retribution. Nero was upset that the UFP did not save Romulus yet they saved their own planets form the Hobus supernova. The computers look more realistic for the 23rd century than they did in Sta Trek TOS given the accelerating changes in technology that occur even today. My favorite part is when Young Spock and Kirk beamed over to the Narada and foiled Nero's plot to destroy Planet Earth."
"butsko02","9","0","0","23 March 2013"," 1966 Redux with Excellence!
","S P O I L E R Alert.<br/><br/>Star Trek began in 1966 and was formatted as a television show (CBS Studios, 2013). The show was abysmal. The acting was B movie grade. The characters were stereotypical, hackneyed, and cheesy. The plots followed a predictable formula. The main character Captain James T. Kirk found himself in an impossible situation, he almost fails and losses everything, when finally the good guys rally to pull out the win. Wash, rinse, repeat. It should have failed. The series was canceled after three seasons, but that was only the beginning for this powerhouse entertainment franchise. Star Trek 2009 stays perfect to form. Director J.J. Abrams continues the Star Trek legacy. This review will reflect the charming and endearing aspects of the original television series was brilliantly captured by Star Trek 2009.<br/><br/>Star Trek is focused on the plot with a motif on characters. The story begins before the time of the original series. It starts with Kirk's father courageously battling the enemy Romulan warship. He saves the unborn Kirk and mother but ultimately dies in the process. Flash- forward about 20 years and we are introduced to the familiar and cocky James T. Kirk (actor Chris Pine). Kirk ends up in a bar where he ends up fighting with several Starfleet cadets. Interrupting the fight is Captain Christopher Pike (actor Bruce Greenwood). After being challenged to live up to his father's legacy by Greenwood, Kirk joins and begins training.<br/><br/>Joining Kirk in training are the Trek originals; Spock (actor Zachary Quinot), Uhura (actress Zoe Saldana), and Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy (actor Karl Urban). Their training is interrupted the characters are quickly deep in intergalactic battle. The story has many twists and turns but eventually Kirk is commanding the U.S.S. Enterprise against the Romulan arch-enemy Nero (actor Eric Bana); the very man who killed Kirk's father. This is a clever segway to tie the past and future together. Through the unexplained future availability of time travel, Nero is not the only man from the future, actor Leonard Nimoy appears as the Spock from the future. <br/><br/>""Conflict is the mainspring of every story"" (Boggs, 2008). The plot of this film is focused on the conflict of situations and the internal and external conflict between characters. The story line conflicts begin early as Pike confronts Nero and just before leaving puts Spock in command of the enterprise with Kirk as first officer. Nero captures Pike and forces Spock to witness the destruction of his home planet. This becomes the seed of internal conflict that ultimately leads to Spock being relieved of command. Kirk and Spock at this stage of the story despise one another. It is a curious and ironic relationship when Kirk learns from future Spock that they will become great friends. This adds to the interesting character developments and furthers the character motif. The theme of this movie includes the action and adventures of the crew. The special effects are the foundational point. The blockbuster appeal of this film is due partly to the amazing imagery and special effects. The computer-generated effects are breath taking. In one exciting scene, Kirk and Sulu (actor John Cho) skydive from outer space to the planet's surface. The infiltrate the planet drill Nero is using to access the planet core. The guards intercept the two and a great fight scene entails. The lighting is used in this film with artistic proficiency. The crisp, brightly-lit, ultramodern bridge of the Starship Enterprise with the intentional high-key lighting represents the cleanliness of good (Boggs, 2008). The grungy, dark, and generally creepy appearance of Nero's ship accompanied with the low-key lighting represents evil (Boggs, 2008). This contrast adds believably to the plot and overall theme. The subjective points of view along with three dimensional arrangements and camera angles make for an exhilarating audience experience. The camera slowly pans the Enterprise and uses camera zoom techniques to exhibit the awesomeness of this ship. This and other cinematography effects make this a breath-taking film to watch. The film has a linear structure, even amidst the time travel, following events as they occur. This helps viewers stay with the potentially complex screenplay and maintains the coherence necessary for understanding the plot. Within this genre of film, the Star Wars franchises of films are very comparable to Star Trek. The Star Wars films follow a very similar structure: focus on plot, character motifs with exciting action packed stories. All of that combined with great special effects results in entertaining movies. These movies are so similar in so many ways, that to compare them requires a razor's edge analysis. The conclusion is a wash; they are equal. Star Trek 2009 is exactly what it reports to be. An exciting plot centered in the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Familiar characters along with extraordinary special effects make this a great movie! 1966 redux!"

","This film shows what Hollywood premier talent can do with a franchise that previously was on its last legs.<br/><br/>I saw this movie when it opened a little less than four years ago. I admit it: I'm an avid Star Trek fan and have been all my life. I had a very good feeling about this movie going in, and when I walked out, I could not be happier that my emotions had been justified.<br/><br/>One does not remake, reboot, or re-anything an entertainment phenomenon as long-lasting as Star Trek without dedication and skill. The director, J. J. Abrams, manifested both qualities in abundance.<br/><br/>The movie began with the time-travel conceit that has been a staple of many a science-fiction story. Abrams ably used it to his advantage to create a new version of the Star Trek universe with characters that both old and new. He gave us a combination of a young Kirk and a familiar setting, with more than enough innovation to make Star Trek new and exciting once again.<br/><br/>With decades of history already written, recorded, and enjoyed by hundreds of millions, the world of Star Trek was running low on fuel. It looked as though ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" would be the last of a singular breed, at least for quite a while. And it had been years since ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" had gone off the years after a shortened run. Even die-hard Trek fans were asking themselves whether Star Trek had finally depleted its deuterium reserves.<br/><br/>Along comes Abrams, with his New Hollywood hustle, with the bustle of new productions under his belt, and a reputation as a daring and adventurous filmmaker. The day that Paramount inked its contract with Abrams for a new Star Trek movie was the day that the franchise found new life.<br/><br/>What do we see in ""Star Trek"" (2009)? As the new sequel draws near, it behooves us to remember: A brash and untried Kirk, a young-yet-cantankerous McCoy, and an ever-logical soon-to-be-best-friend, Spock, whose human side has yet to fully emerge. Together with the rest of the crew, the new cast brings an energy that the previous cast no longer had.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor: Rather than reading yet another review of ""Star Trek"" (2009), buy, download, rent, or stream the movie for viewing once again, or break out the discs you purchased, and enjoy this movie for the spectacular it is. I saw it numerous times, including at the theater, and enjoyed every viewing. You will see why the consensus is that this is one of the best films in the Star Trek universe, and why it would be a crime against science fiction moviedom not to catch the new sequel at least once when it comes out this May.<br/><br/>Great entertainment like this doesn't come around too often even for those of us who are lucky enough to live long and prosper."

It's a 2 hour tribute to military interventions and a rape on the original concept. It's no longer a science-is-cool-movie, it's a ""go-join-the-army-movie. <br/><br/>And the Star Wars resemblance mentioned in other reviews is embarrassing. Once you start seeing how they copied many ideas from Star Wars the movie becomes simple and predictable. <br/><br/>Star Trek has baldly gone from logical and interesting to emotional and predictable like so many other movies lately. <br/><br/>But the effects are pretty good looking.

","I went to see this with a lot of nervousness as I thought Quinto, Urban and Saldana were the only ones who looked right for the roles. I took to Pine within a few minutes of watching and Quinto the same. Saldana didn't get nearly enough screen time but in all honesty was given the time that is usually alloted to Uhura and brought all the warmth and beauty that Nicholls brought to the original Uhura. When I saw and heard Karl Urban as McCoy I got a shiver down my spine! Not only looked like a young DeForest Kelley but had the gruffness and almost identical personality! The Nero angle and Spock (Nimoy) involvement was sub story enough not to take us away from the leads. Chekov was young, brash and as green as a 17 year old would be. The loss of Amanda, Spock's mother is left to be continued. The destruction of Vulcan is a puzzle and the survivors must have relocated to a planet they renamed Vulcan to be in the universe we know. Sarek and the supporting parts were satisfactory and in all it's been a long time since I've enjoyed a movie as much as I did this. Begone all ye naysayers...."

","I'll start by admitting the following: I'm an old-school, original series fan; I reluctantly accepted ""The Next Generation"" after it was well into syndication; never watched ""Deep Space Nine"" or the other spin-off series; have never attended a Star Trek convention; but know every episode of the original show inside and out. I've seen all the movies, & think ST II, III, & IV were the only ones worth the price of admission. Each subsequent film seemed to get worse. All that is to provide some context for what follows, and to explain why my expectations for this film were very low.<br/><br/>I was, however, pleasantly surprised. Strong points include cinematography, set design, story, character development, costume design, creativity, and fun. As a dyed-in-the-wool fan, I was on the look out for inconsistencies of plot, technology, character history, etc. Many such inconsistencies began to appear within the first few minutes for the film, and I resigned myself to a post-modern deconstruction of the original series characters. This is especially true of James T. Kirk, who appears not as the powerful but controlled, suave, entirely confident, all-around capable leader we know from the 60's series, but rather, as a raw, brash, impulsive, unformed pre-character version (a la Daniel Craig's James Bond in ""Casino Royale"").<br/><br/>The story, however, cleverly winds around itself to provide not only a time-warping explanation of these inconsistencies, but more importantly, establishes an entire new timeline/divergence/parallel universe, whose essence is familiar to science fiction fans, and whose employment here creates an entirely new treatment of Star Trek. It provides the franchise with a new lease on life, independent of the history of the old series and its successors. In other words, it is a fresh new start.<br/><br/>This is infinitely preferable (for me) to a plodding homage, attempting simply to retell an old story over again -- the worst example of which is perhaps the abysmal ""Superman Returns."" I think it also provides younger viewers with the opportunity to form their own (current) attachments to Star Trek and its characters. Whatever this says about our culture, at the very least, it's good for the box office.<br/><br/>On the down side, the script was frankly a bit weak. An ample helping of familiar aphorisms from the old show was served out to please old fans -- e.g., Dr. McCoy's famous ""Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a (fill in the blank),"" but with enough restraint to keep the film from becoming a parody. These were dished out sparingly at first, and with increasing frequency as the characters began to evolve into the more familiar constellation of relationships one recalls from the original series. The rest of the script, however, lacked a bit of punch. Trekkies will no doubt compare it unfavorably with the script in ""Wrath of Khan,"" which was stellar.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is a minor criticism of what was overall an enjoyable and inventive treatment, reviving an old mythology for a new audience (without alienating an older one). Honestly -- and truly -- none of these films is ""Lawrence of Arabia"" -- but within its genre, I have to give it a strong 9 out of 10. And I am planning to see the as-yet-unwritten sequel. My recommendation: See it. And definitely on the big screen."
"milesflatt","10","5","16","9 May 2009"," A Thrilling Adventure and Rebirth of Star Trek
","Prepare for the ultimate interstellar galactic adventure in the new Star Trek. The movie is perfect. With a plot that has you sitting on the edge of your seat, stunning visuals and great acting from an all star cast, this all new look and rebirth of the Star Trek franchise will be a pleasing to everyone. Unlike previous Star Trek movies which are aimed more towards audiences, this movie is for everyone and here is why.<br/><br/>The story primarily focuses on how Kirk and Spock become the characters we know them to be. It starts with a back story on each of their childhoods revealing their strengths and weaknesses. The chemistry between them is no doubt one of the greatest aspects of the movie thanks to young actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. As the movie goes on they find themselves fighting with each other until they eventually realize their differences and come together to fight the common enemy Nero, a slightly troubled Romulan played by Eric Bana who is capable of destroying an entire planet! The new young crew of the enterprise finds themselves dealing with problems and confrontations they've never experienced before and do their best to take on the evil Romulan.<br/><br/>I have to say this is one of the best casted movies I've seen in a while. Each member does their part to give the new crew of the Enterprise some originality as well as maintaining enough similarities to the characters of the old Trek. Actors Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), John Cho (Harold and Kumar) and Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings) help to add comic relief throughout the film all the while you're sitting on the edge of your seat shivering with anxiety. I was really surprised by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto's performance as Kirk and Spock. They both have never experienced a leading role for a highly anticipated summer film and did great. They fit into their roles so perfectly and had such great chemistry together. Eric Bana was fantastic as the villain; you can hardly tell it's him with all that alien make up. You will even be surprised by the appearance of Leonard Nimoy as Spock from the future, satisfying die hard Trek fans. Did I mention the visual effects yet? If I have already I must re-emphasize how spectacular they are. The scenes in outer space are all beautifully done with many bright explosions and colorful laser blasts. There are a few monsters in the movie that are simply terrifying and look completely believable as monsters of a distant future. Even the sounds are amusing to listen to as alarms on the spacecraft and explosions rattle the audience.<br/><br/>It's truly one of the best movies I've seen in a while and a great reboot to the Trek Franchise. It's no surprise that this piece of magic was produced by J.J Abrams (creator of Lost). He truly knows how to make an engaging piece of work. It's a perfect combo of action, adventure, science fiction and drama. This is one of those movies that will have you wishing it would go on and on and when it comes to an endyou just want to see it again. <br/><br/>Live long and prosper"

"TxMike","Null","4","12","27 November 2009"," Fine movie based on the 1960s TV series.
","I am of the vintage that watched the Star Trek TV series during its original run. To its credit this movie follows much of the workings of the show quite closely, but adds layers that make it more interesting in a modern take.<br/><br/>As I was watching it I was reminded of the fairly recent movie ""Batman Begins."" In a similar sense, this movie could quite easily have been called ""Star Trek: Captain Kirk Begins."" Because that is the movie in its essence, how the character James T. Kirk came about, a bit of his antics as a child, his unorthodox experiences in starship training programs, and what events led to his becoming, at a relatively young age, the Captain of the Enterprise.<br/><br/>Chris Pine, mostly of TV acting background, is ideal as James T. Kirk. Likewise Zachary Quinto, also a very experienced TV actor, is ideal as Spock. From the original series we also have Leonard Nimoy, pushing 80, as Spock Prime, which involves some 'time travel' where Spock Prime ends up interacting with the younger crew members.<br/><br/>As an aside of sorts, it was fun seeing finny Brit Simon Pegg in a different role for him, mostly a dramatic role but with a very funny take, as Montgomery Scott who is credited with developing the approach necessary to transport people to a space ship traveling at 'warp speed.' <br/><br/>There is no need to get into the details here, suffice to say there are fierce battles with enemies. But in the end we see how Kirk became Captain, and how he and Spock forged what would have appeared as an unlikely partnership. <br/><br/>Good movie.<br/><br/>Jan 2010 edit: Saw it again, I enjoyed it even more the second time. Really good movie."
"seaview1","9","4","12","13 May 2009"," Star Trek Redux Exhilerates
","Continuing the trend of reinventing sixties iconic figures such as Batman and James Bond, Star Trek was inevitably next in line. For those who fretted that the new incarnation of creator Gene Roddenberry's beloved franchise of 'Wagon Train to the Stars' would be dishonored or ignored, they needn't worry. This new version, intended to reboot the franchise that was so popular in TV reruns and subsequently in a series of big budget films, is a remarkably balanced take on the origins of the classic Enterprise crew. It is designed to appeal to the non-initiated audience while referencing the existing canon of Star Trek lore. Director J. J. Abrams (Fringe, Alias, Mission Impossible III) brings a fresh vision abetted by Trekkie fan/writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman.<br/><br/>James T. Kirk is born as his father rescues a starship crew during a Romulan attack led by the mysterious Nero (Eric Bana). A young rebel who grows into a brash, thrill seeking adventurer, young Kirk (Chris Pine) is recruited into Star Fleet Academy by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Meanwhile the half Vulcan / half human Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) has matured amid bullying kids and decides his destiny lies with The Federation as a cadet instead of his home planet Vulcan. Kirk strikes up a friendship with an ornery young Doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban is a hoot) whose distrust of space and things not medical will become legendary. It is McCoy who devises a way for Kirk to become a crew member of the newly commissioned starship Enterprise. In fact, most of what will become the core crew is assembled including communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsmen Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and later, engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg). Seeking vengeance against the Federation, Nero has traveled through time to exact pain and destruction with a planet killing device that will draw the Enterprise to Vulcan and ultimately Earth. With the Universe in the balance, Kirk and Spock must decide if they can work together (with the help of a certain mentor).<br/><br/>The parallel life paths of Kirk and Spock are marked contrasts of two men who will clash and reconcile their future relationship. Kirk smacks of hawkish, shoot-from-the-hip reactionary while Spock is the logical, think-inside-the-box good soldier. Nero reminds us a bit of Khan from Wrath of Khan. The character of Uhura is a major upgrade. She is a multi-talented officer who has romantic longings for a certain Vulcan. Greenwood shines as the veteran Pike. Leonard Nimoy makes a welcome, pivotal appearance as an elder Spock who figures prominently in the history that is to come. The cast makes the most of iconic roles and excels at recreating the personas of what we remember; each crew member gets an opportunity to shine. It is nice to see this group working and improvising together for the first time to solve a crisis. Further, this story takes it for granted as does its audience that this crew is not only multicultural, but multi-species, a far cry from the novelty of the integrated crew of classic Trek.<br/><br/>The screenplay has some well written dialogue and clever Trek references sprinkled throughout, and age old lines of the classic show are introduced for the first time. When McCoy utters, ""I'm a doctor, not a physicist"", it's a riot. Part of the fun is watching two heavyweights like Kirk and Spock faceoff and slowly bond and seeing how Kirk ascends to the captain's chair. We finally get to learn what the 'Kobayashi Maru' wargame really is and how Kirk manages to defeat the test.<br/><br/>Sure, the plot has some gaping holes if you think about continuity and the fate of a certain venerable, classic character. Nero's motives are explained in time, but they don't make total sense. This film also does not have the gravitas of deep themes as previous films which is perhaps its only true failing, but instead, we get a strong character study that more than compensates.<br/><br/>Technical effects are quite impressive although Abrams seems to favor close-ups and tight camera setups that put the viewer in the middle of action scenes. Fortunately, there are no jarring Cloverfield hand-held camera moves. There is a good fight sequence on a weapons platform and a surprise on an ice planet. You want phasers shooting back and forth in space battle? You've got them here. In fact the energy level keeps this voyage bouncing along.<br/><br/>The Enterprise is stunning-it has never looked quite this way ever, and it is cool how they depict the starship going into warp drive. There are imaginative points of view when showing off the ship's exterior, and the interior is brimming with activity and sound, which is in stark contrast to the more antiseptic views from the earlier show. The costumes (complete with female miniskirts) harken back to that period and yet seem fresh. At credits' end, there is a nice dedication to the Roddenberrys, Gene and Majel Barrett (who voices the Federation computer one last time).<br/><br/>Fans of the old show may tear up at how faithful and creative Abrams and his screenwriters are with Trek lore and how they set everything up nicely going forward. This is their alternate universe now, and we are game for the experience. This crew, baptized under fire, is ready for new missions, and they cannot come soon enough. Way to go, Mr. Abrams. This Trek rocks! ***1/2 of **** stars"

"The_Film_Addict","10","4","12","11 May 2009"," Star Trek is at the top of its game.
","Premiering on television airwaves in 1966, Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek"" was an allegory towards contemporary society; within this utopian future, a group of men and women of all races, free from the clutches of racism and sexism, would unite together ""to boldly go where no man has gone before."" ""Trek"" was powerful in its storytelling and reaffirmed the bold, unique powers of science fiction. Though ""Star Trek"" ran a measly three seasons, this failed television series boosted an influential legacy. With ten feature films under its belt, six TV series, comic books, and even a short-lived animated series, there's no doubt of the massive, influential impact this mythic universe had on popular culture. Warping to 2009, in an age where reboots and remakes run Hollywood, newbie director J.J. Abrams (creator of ""Lost"") leads a hip, modern cast in a new, ultra stylized reimagining of a television classic. Though Abrams' reboot is low on plot, ""Star Trek"" never fails from being a high-octane, hair-raising, pyrotechnic displaying, laser-tag chasing, visual effect showcasing thrill ride. ""Star Trek"" is at the top of its game.<br/><br/>Twenty-two years after the heroic death of his father, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), an intelligent and often reckless young man, fills his time slurping beer and looking for trouble. After failing to womanize Uhura (Zoë Saldana) in an Iowan bar, Kirk, yet again, lances himself into a brawl with a group of overly confident academy students. Noting the fierce determination Kirk possesses, and his father's inherited bravery, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), commander of the U.S.S. Enterprise, encourages the young, misguided Kirk to join the Starfleet. Knowing what little he has, Kirk, slightly hesitant, joins the Academy where he meets Dr. Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), a loud mouthed, paranoid physician who fears the coldness of space. Years later, Kirk, still up to his old, devious ways, is put on academic suspension after strangely passing Spock's (Zachary Quinto) exigent flight simulator. When a distress signal is beamed from the distant planet Vulcan, Kirk, dodging academic suspension, is smuggled onto the U.S.S Enterprise with the clever help of Dr. McCoy. Once on the sacred Enterprise, Kirk's journey towards captain of the Enterprise and the formation of his aggressive, platonic friendship with the half-human half-Vulcan Spock begins.<br/><br/>Let's be honest here, over the years, ""Star Trek"" has been reduced to ridicule by the vast majority who think the series' mythology is one big, fat joke. The term Trekie (or Treker depending who you ask) even carries a negative connotation, we assume some middle-aged, convention attending, pimply-faced virgin, is the show's only target demograph. Unfortunately for those bashers, they never truly understood the power of this show or the power of the science-fiction in general. However, luckily for this franchise, J.J. Abrams' reboot, which is being marketed as ""not your father's 'Star Trek,'"" is surly to induct a new set of followers into this long established cult.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why this film is works is because of its hip, modern cast. From Kirk, Spock to Scotty (ingeniously played by Simon Pegg), each member of the cast brings a newly-formed resonance to its character. ""Trek's"" modern cast are not the scripted-punching actors of the 60's, the revamped update features fierce, spontaneous characters who are driven by mesmerizing performances. It's genius in its casting. Even the villainous Nero (Eric Bana), who gets little screen time and quite frankly a microscopic amount of villain time, brings an enormous amount of energy to the picture. Zachary Quinto, of Heroes fame, too, is able to confidently recreate Leonard Nimoy's initial creation.<br/><br/>Not only is the cast a marvel, but the film's technicality is amazing in its execution. Drowned in vibrant colors, slick architecture, and astounding set pieces, the film's production design is the stuff that dreams are made off. Director J.J. Abrams, who clearly has respect and enthusiasm for the source material, adds an alluring cinematic quality to every frame of this picture; he reaffirms the daring, stunning magic of movie making. ""Trek's"" Composer Michael Giacchino even manages to create an iconic score, replicating the unforgettable orchestrated sound of John Williams, is bound to take audiences back to the classic days of science fiction.<br/><br/>It's an exciting movie that proves not all Hollywood movies have to be reduced to cheese. It's cold, hard hitting entertainment of the highest order; it's entertainment done right! In fact, this is the type of film that deserves to be seen two, three or even four times on the biggest screen you could find. Headed by a competent cast and crew, ""Star Trek"" is a rock solid production."

I went into this movie not knowing what to expect and as i sat through the glorious 120 minutes of the movie i was completely blown away.

"Prichards12345","6","4","12","9 May 2009"," Good but I have mixed feelings.
","The above says it all, really. J.J. Abraham's reboot of Star Trek is bold, exciting, action-packed, decently acted and well-directed, with good effects, humour and a touching appearance by the original Spock himself, Leonard Nimoy. But there is really one big problem with it.<br/><br/>It isn't Star Trek.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire 40-odd year history of the franchise, what made Star Trek so popular was it's commitment to optimism, philosophical fun, and some tongue-in-cheek cheesiness. Roddenberry and his writers created a universe that the viewer wanted to belong to. But this film wipes the entire history of Star Trek in one fell swoop, and creates a grimed-up world of its own making. Gone is the clean-cut look; the Enterprise's engineering section looks more like an oil refinery than a sophisticated Starship. And consider the following:<br/><br/>WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS! <br/><br/>Not long after Kirk And Spock first meet, the planet Vulcan is destroyed, killing Spock's mother in the process.<br/><br/>Kirk's father is also killed at the moment his son is born, defending his family against the same Romulan responsible for Vulcan's destruction, completely rewriting Kirk's personal history at a stroke.<br/><br/>Uhura and Spock fall for each other, hugging and kissing in a scene near the end.<br/><br/>And although Leonard Nimoy narrates the famous Star Trek credo, to seek out new life etc, what we really have is an action war movie, with little of Star Trek's respect for cultural differences. Star Trek dumbed down to the level of Battlestar Galactica - I'm talking about the old one! I don't think I've ever seen a film with as many plot holes as this one and still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>However if you can forget the entire history of the franchise you can find much to admire - Zachary Quinto is an excellent Spock, and Chris Pine is also a brash likable Kirk. Some of the action sequences are brilliant, Kirk and Sulu's attempt to save Vulcan by a sub-orbital drop is breath-taking, as is the final battle sequence with The Enterprise appearing suddenly above Saturn's rings to take the Romulan ship by surprise - a sure nod to The Wrath Of Khan, here. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg has a standout-extended cameo as Scotty, though Eric Bana's Romulan villain Nero feels pretty one-dimensional. In the film's biggest misstep, he even waits around for 25 years, just to have his revenge on Spock.<br/><br/>Entertaining and fast-moving, then. But it's just not Star Trek."
"jessieong","10","4","12","8 May 2009"," The Best Star Trek Ever!
","There have been a lot of Star Treks in many forms. Most have been pretty good. I have been watching Star Trek since the 60's. Only ""Star Trek the Movie"" has been a disappointment. The ""Wrath of Kahn"" has been the best, until now! Trust me, you will enjoy this version. All the old actors (that are still alive) should be proud to have these young actors portray the characters they took so long to develop. I think this movie will spawn a whole new generation of Trekkers! I know my son is 25 years old and I'm sure he doesn't consider himself a Trekker. He might after seeing this show. This movie gives great background on the main characters so that this new generation have a starting place to fall for these characters."

","Abrams and crew went above and beyond my expectations and completely blew me away with fascinating visual effects, top notch music and high grade acting. Just like what Nolan did to Batman, JJ Abrams breathed new life to a dormant franchise and one can assume that this is where things will kickstart for Captain Kirk and his Enterprise crew. Having seen this one, I am all for a Star Trek 12 and I might even buy the classic series and the preceding movies. JJ Abrams, also the director of underrated action piece Mission Impossible 3, definitely has an eye for action and escapist storytelling and this movie might just be his hot ticket to greater movie projects.<br/><br/>I've had my reservations with Chris Pine playing Kirk because to be honest, no one really knew him and the fans were worried if the new Captain Kirk will work or not. Well, fortunately all is good and well with Chris Pine as he fills in the shoes of William Shatner. Pine's approach to Kirk brings justice to Shatner's unique portrayal while making a distinct personality that caters the new generation. Not to be outdone, Zachary Quinto of Heroes fame brings the assertiveness and gusto of Spock to a whole new level. Both of them meld perfectly on screen and the chemistry has a certain spark and charm that will be remembered by fans and non-fans alike. Tip of the hat also to Karl Urban who plays Bones McCoy, Simon Pegg as disgraced engineer Scotty, Zoe Saldana as feisty Uhura and a kickass John Cho as Enterprise pilot Hikari Sulu. Eric Bana channels some of his ""Chopper characteristics playing main baddie, Nero and for all intents and purposes, his turn as a villain was effective and three dimensional. <br/><br/>Mind blowing visual effects and an ear piercing and stunning score by Michael Giacchino bookends this visual treat of a movie that is turning to be an early 2009 favorite among fans and critics. A must see for the summer movie season."

","***There are SPOILERS in this review***<br/><br/>I have spent most of the afternoon trying to formulate a review that is a little calmer than how I felt when I left the cinema after seeing Star Trek... to say I left the theatre bouncing off the walls and with an inane grin should give you some clue as to how this film blew me away – it was FANTASTIC!<br/><br/>I am 44 years old and grew up with these characters from the age of about 5 or 6, and let me tell you, the casting was top notch! Zachary Quinto as Spock was brilliant, Chris Pine as Kirk was brilliant, although I felt his character was a little too arrogant to start with, but by the end of the film I saw that he had to be cocky in order for his character to grow into the role, and boy, did he ever?! Simon Pegg as Scotty was hilariously brilliant – what a way to enter a star ship! LOL! But the stand out for me was Karl Urban as Leonard McCoy. He had his dry, sometime pithy sarcastic humour down to a T, and I was not watching someone playing the younger version of Bones – I was watching Bones himself.<br/><br/>Another mention must go to Eric Bana who is fantastic and totally unrecognisable as the Romulan, Nero. Whatever you do, do not get into this film late, otherwise you will miss the awesome spectacle of his ship appearing on screen for the first time. It was also wonderful to see Leonard Nimoy as old Spock, and not just in a bit part, either. However, one thing that did bother me a little, I'm a child of the time/space continuum theory, and I didn't altogether agree with the two Spocks having a heart to heart, but that is a minor point.<br/><br/>The opening scenes had me welling up and thankful that I had gone to see it alone – how embarrassing, crying at a film within the first 5 minutes, and a Star Trek movie at that! *rolleyes* <br/><br/>The original series started in the 60's, and I loved how Earth, although is was in the future, was reminiscent of this era.<br/><br/>To summarise, if you can only afford to see one film this summer, make sure it's this one."

"andypoek","10","3","8","4 August 2010"," J.J. Abrams asks the question, can Trek movie be cool?
","The latest genesis of the Star Trek franchise is a great stand-alone movie that pays its respect to the ""product"" that proceeded it. This ""Star Trek"" was definitely created with the goal of drawing in a younger audience without offending the thousands of Trekkies who grew up with the show. As one of those original fans of the 60s television show, I can say without hesitation that I thoroughly enjoyed the ""rewrite"" of the Star Trek Mythology and found the movie to be a blast. The special effects were outstanding, the sound quality was wonderful, and the actors (even though faced with an almost impossible task of playing roles so well-known that they're become iconic), all succeeded in making the film work quite well.<br/><br/>In thinking about the task that faced these young actors I really am quite impressed that they were able to pull off their portrayals so well. They made it easy for the viewer to forget that in addition to playing their role assigned to the film, they also had to play the actor who played the role in the original series.<br/><br/>Oh sure...there are some liberties taken with the film. (Vulcan, for one, is surely treated roughly.) (Spock and Uhura? Who'd thought it?) All in all though, the film is true to the series and has included a great cameo by an old friend."
"wwefreakjon","10","3","8","23 May 2010"," Not What our fathers grew up with
","Earlier tonight I was given the pleasure of watching the latest Star Trek film and I have got to admit that it surpassed even my expectations. I was expecting a sexed up version of the original series that my dad grew up with and that I grew up with the re runs of. I was only half right. What waited for me was not only a sexed up version of what I'd grown to love over the years but a new beginning for the franchise.<br/><br/>The movie begins with an epic battle sequence showing the voyage of the USS Kelvin versus a monstrous Romulan vessel know as the Narada. During the battle George Kirk gives his life as the captain of the Kelvin so that the rest of the crew, including his wife and newborn son, can escape. The next part of the movie shows the son (James T Kirk) 25 years later going to star fleet academy. When a problem arises on planet Vulcan, all of the Star Fleet cadets are called to help out. When they arrive at Vulcan they find that the same ship that had destroyed the Kelvin 28 years earlier is attacking Vulcan.<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely fantastic, and one of the reasons for this is the casting. I know that most trekkies were rather uneasy about rebooting the series because of the casting issue but they did a fantastic job. McCoy and Spock were perfectly cast and did great jobs of taking on the characters and making them their own. Kirk was taken on by Chris Pine and this may be considered blasphemy by Trek fans but I like him as much as I liked Shatner. My favourite member had to be Scotty. He was the one person (Simon Pegg) that I knew would do a bang up job.<br/><br/>That is not to say the the casting was the only good thing, because the direction, special effects, and editing were all just as great. I seriously can't wait until the next movie."
"Wizardling","5","3","8","25 April 2010"," Great fun, staggering disregard for logic.
","A fun, action packed film with excellent re-imagined characters, great visuals and a very ST sense of humour :-) Sadly it's let down by staggering disregard/ignorance for basic logic and science - even ST universe science.<br/><br/>A ""supernova that threatens the galaxy""? GALAXY??? Is there a giant star millions of times bigger than the largest know star out there? If so, one wonders why the rest of the galaxy wasn't pulled inside it by it's massive gravity well long ago...<br/><br/>And oh how convenient there's a planet of ANOTHER star system, not Vulcan's, that future Spock can watch Vulcan's destruction from... with the unaided eye. Sorry, did the Universe suddenly shrink? First a super massive supernova that threatens the galaxy, now the galaxy is so tightly compacted you can see one planet from another planet circling a totally different star? I could go on, but you get the point. The director was either asleep in science class... all 12 years worth of lessons it would seem. Or he has no respect for the intelligence of ST fans, let alone the average viewer. Don't get me wrong - I suspend belief for 'impossible' ST technologies like the transporter all the time. I've been happily doing so since original ST. In fact a certain ability to suspend belief is required to enjoy almost every science fiction movie or TV series (let's face it - perfect quiet in outer space scenes are not real exciting for the viewer, etc, etc). But the new ST movie takes this too far. My ability to enjoy it was severely and all too frequently compromised by the utter absurdities taking place on screen. What a damn shame. Cause the acting was absolutely first rate IMO.<br/><br/>Edit: I have since been informed that canon has been retroactively altered to place Delta Vega (Delta means fourth, so 'Fourth planet of the Vega system')... inside the Vulcan system. Okay... However one wonders why the hell it's still called Delta Vega then... That fits no known naming convention for planets without a proper name.<br/><br/>Oh, and I watched the movie again last night to see if it still felt as dumb as the first time. I was worried my review above might've been unnecessarily harsh. Sadly I was right the first time - ST 2009 is mind-blowingly dumb :-("
"manicman84","8","3","8","25 March 2010"," a sci-fi adventure movie at its peak
","My opinion on the new ""Star Trek"" doesn't really differ from the general one. J.J. Abrams succeeded in making a reboot that's both fresh and respectful to its source material. He didn't experiment with the new technologies or complex narrative, but conveyed the dynamic, yet totally comprehensible storyline intersected by numerous allusions to the old series. You don't need to be a trekkie to fully enjoy this movie that can be described as humorous, fast-paced and universally gripping. The action sequences are never less than awe-inspiring. The transformation of James T. Kirk is entirely believable and unforced. Chris Payne is great in this role, just as practically everyone from the distinguishable supporting cast. ""Star Trek"" can be considered a sci-fi adventure movie at its peak, still it lacks certain kind of depth and emotion to be truly remarkable for me. Nevertheless, it's without any trace of doubt an essential viewing even for people who have not been particularly interested in this saga before."
"athomed","8","3","8","15 January 2010"," This is a remake not a re-imagining.
","After finishing the movie it's clear that this movie isn't out to neglect the source material and completely create new characters. The creators of this movie took great care in giving Trekkie fans a nice Vulcan salute. This is a really great movie! I'm glad that Star Trek was put into the right hands. A disaster could have spelled disaster to a franchise very important to me and many, many others.<br/><br/>Everything works out well in this movie. It has a fast pace. It's edited nicely. There's no time to waste scenes in this movie. This is also a very funny movie at some points. Especially a sick Kirk running around the ship with swollen hands and tongue while Bones is following him trying to cure him.<br/><br/>This movie really doesn't disappoint. I can't wait for the next movie to come out. Walk into ""Star Trek 2009"" with an open mind and you'll be glad you did."
"Rob_Taylor","8","3","8","23 November 2009"," Rather better than I had feared!
","Soooo...They made a Star Trek movie. They made it using Kirk, McCoy and Spock et al, but not the original actors. Oooookay. Not happy about that.<br/><br/>This was my initial reaction to the announcement of this film.<br/><br/>Having seen it, I'm actually very pleased to have been proved wrong. See, I grew up with Shatner, Nimoy and the rest. So when Next Gen came out, I was disposed not to like that. It won me over (well....apart from Wesley Crusher, anyhow). Same with all the other spin-off series. But when it came to replacing those iconic first characters! How dare they! Who could step into those shoes and do a good job? Well, it appears, the cast of Star Trek have done just that. Some of them, it has to be said, are more comfortable and convincing in their roles than others. But none of them suck.<br/><br/>Most of the objection to this film seems to centre around either the cast being replaced, or the fact that ""the timeline has been altered!"" I've addressed the former, but here's some thoughts on the timeline thing.<br/><br/>See, I'll be the first to agree that Trek overuses time travel. It's become like the only futuristic tech thing they can come up with. It is a big yawn. But the argument here that ""they've invalidated all of the rest of the Trek canon!"" is really both naive and rather simplistically childish. Has no one who watched this movie not also watched any other time travel movie involving branching timelines? Alternatively, try reading any book by Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, for some ideas of what could be possible.<br/><br/>Anyhow, back to the film. Is it any good? Well, yes. There are plot holes in it - big ones. Holes you could fly the Enterprise through and not touch the sides. And the plot - minus the holes - is still a pretty simple save the galaxy affair. But it is enjoyable, and it is fun.<br/><br/>Even when the new actors utter the old classic lines of dialogue, it just raises a warm feeling inside, rather than the horrible cringing I had expected to experience.<br/><br/>And as for the fact that ""the past has been changed"" so what? All that means is a greater creative freedom to take the series in new directions. Let's face it, what else was going to happen? Another spin-off series with more of the same old, same old? Another Next Gen movie? The franchise needed a new breath of life. Hopefully this is it. Let's see what they come up with next."
"littlemomma07","10","3","8","11 August 2009"," Different Universe?
","I am not sure what would be considered a spoiler so I gave the possibility that it might have one or a few.<br/><br/>It is sad how many have complained that it was a horrible movie. The effects were great, the acting was great and solid and the story was great. Those of you who are die hard fans here is why I thought the story was great: <br/><br/>Gene Roddenberry is not around anymore to write anymore Star Trek stories sadly. In both TNG and Voyager they dealt with time traveling and alternate time lines. I am unsure about the others. But if you take this movie as an alternate time line and run with it, it will make J.J. Abrams a genius as a director and Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman geniuses as writers. This, if you look at it, will let Star Trek Live on. No, it doesn't follow the original program nor does it follow the written series. But it is still genius. The movie industry has been running out of ideas for new movies anyway and this, if more are made, will make some good movies. Now the question is, does Janeway exist? Do the others? How can this change the future of this science fiction? A lot of things didn't follow how Star Fleet would do things. Like Kirk being kicked off of the ship. How were rules changed due to the mess up in the beginning? He was viewed as a trouble maker and Spock did what he thought was proper. He was, after all, acting from emotions instead of logic.<br/><br/>The movie explains things great. You aren't left asking ""why?"" I am frustrated, as a fellow writer, that those that are against this are so negative about this.<br/><br/>If you are reading this and haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest watching it for yourself. Keep an open mind that it could be an alternate reality.<br/><br/>10 stars to the director and writers for this movie as well as everyone else that worked on this movie."
"Deckard-16","9","3","8","17 May 2009"," A TERRIFIC Summer movie!
","I've always liked Star Trek but never loved it (except on a few occasions: ST I, Wrath Of Khan & the ""save the whales"" movie). People who speak Klingon creep me out.<br/><br/>I gotta say that this new Trek was a blast!<br/><br/>This re-boot rates up there with Batman Begins & Casino Royale. (It'll be interesting to see if the next Trek will bring us an excellent Dark Knight or a disappointing Quantum.)<br/><br/>The casting is great! Zachory Quinto & Karl Urban (remember Bourne's main nemesis in Supremacy?) do a fine job at channeling Spock & McCoy. Whereas Chris Pine puts his own stamp on Kirk & it is a welcome one. It's great to have a sexy Uhura (Zoe Saldana sizzles in the role). The rest of cast is fun to watch too.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away, but I was happy to see that Leonard Nimoy's presence is much more than a cameo. Eric Bana's villainous rebel Romulan is super intense & almost turns the fun faucet off at times, but I loved it!<br/><br/>If you are a sci-fi nut then you will not find the story confusing. The action is whiz-bang & beautifully presented. There is a lot of eye-candy up on the screen.<br/><br/>Like last year's Ironman, this is summer entertainment at its best. In fact, I like this new Trek better than Ironman (that final battle in Ironman dragged a bit).<br/><br/>This Trek makes you wanting to take another one."
"themisfit","8","3","8","17 May 2009"," An enjoyable Summer movie
","From J.J. Abrams of ""Lost"" fame comes a reboot and prequel to Star Trek simply entitled ""Star Trek."" The film chronicles the early days of Captain Kirk and Spock and basically serves as an origin story for these two characters and the rest of the crew members of the USS Enterprise during their mission to stop time-traveling Romulans who, angered by the loss of their home world, seek revenge against the star fleet. Coming from a person with a very limited amount of Star Trek viewing history and background knowledge, with the exception of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" and ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,"" it's safe to say that this movie is very enjoyable as a standalone picture and the start of what is hopefully a great trilogy. It seems as if the intention of this movie was to cater to a wide audience and it sets out to do just that, as the absence of things such as ""technobabble"" would indicate and the characterization simply sets the ground work for who these characters are and what they will do. However, ""dumbing down"" Star Trek seems to have also alienated long-time fans of the franchise, but in short, ""Star Trek"" is simply a Summer film and an enjoyable one at that."
"erdprods","9","3","8","15 May 2009"," An Awesome Re-Boot
","A very logical extension of the original in which Abrams and his friends use their standard ploy on Star Trek, successfully. An 'alternative universe' has been created by Spock and Nero when they came back in time and tinkered with things. As such all the original characters can now be anything the authors would like, because of the tinkering element. Even Rick Berman would go along with this because Mike Pillar (STNG) has made many dissertations about time travel concepts and, indeed, Mike and Rick made these happen in STNG. This, thus, makes it credible and allows Star Trek to continue on for years! Orci and Kurtzman are to be commended for holding to the basic template with Pike and they didn't make Pike nearly as radically different at Berman and Pillar made Zefram different from ST to STNG the Movie (First Conctact).<br/><br/>The new universe in which Spock and Uhura have a ""thang"" is going to be decidedly different.<br/><br/>We can't say this is wrong as in the original Spock and Chappel had a ""thang"" that was mutually acknowledged in Amok Time.<br/><br/>Orci and Kurtzman are to be commended for being ""quite logical"" and for centering on SPOCK as the true essenece of Star Trek.<br/><br/>May the franchise ""Live Long and Prosper!""

","I have never seen a full episode of Star Trek in my life, but when I saw the previews for this movie, I knew I had to go see it. It didn't disappoint one bit. The movie was filled with great storytelling, great action sequences, and the CGI was possibly the best I have ever seen on any film. <br/><br/>I liked pretty much everything about this movie, from the gorgeous visuals to the surprisingly good storyline that was quite clever. If there was one thing I could change about this movie though, I would make it longer! When I sat down in the theater, I was expecting to be there for a good 3 and a half to 4 hours.

I was never quite a fan of remaking a film, but I'm glad they did. The story would seem confusing to some (just ask my wife), but all your questions are answered throughout the film. For those of you who adore the original series, I believe you will enjoy this film. Like I said before, the acting was superb.

"Mythos_Ruler","9","3","8","15 May 2009"," The cast excels in their roles! Fun flick with tight action sequences.
","I just saw this flick today, after anticipating it for 2 years, ever since it was announced. I grew up in The Next Generation, but still have a kind fondness for The Original Series. I think The Wrath of Khan is the best movie and Deep Space Nine the best of the TV series.<br/><br/>I liked JJ's Star Trek a lot. I really do mean a lot. I wasn't blown away by it like I was blown away by the Dark Knight last summer. I would give Star Trek an 8.5 out of 10. For comparison I would give The Wrath of Khan a 9.0 out of 10 and The Final Frontier (Star Trek 5) a 5.0 out of 10. Overall the movie was about as much as a fan could hope for in essentially what amounts to a reboot of the entire mythos, from the era of Kirk onward.<br/><br/>The entire cast of the Enterprise are perfect for their roles. I couldn't be more pleased with Quinto as Spock, Saldana as Uhura, Cho as Sulu, Pegg as Scotty, and Yelchin (in a surprisingly funny turn) as Pavel Chekhov. I reserve special commendation for Karl Urban as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and Chris Pine as James Kirk. Both of these men NAILED their roles and were an inspiration, both for very different reasons. First off, Karl Urban's essentially channels the late-great Deforest Kelley, the original Doctor McCoy, with great skill! His mannerisms and speech, while not a complete imitation of the original McCoy, immediately ""sells"" the performance. and the man who had the biggest shoes to fill, Chris Pine, pulls off his performance for a very different reason. He makes the character of Kirk his own. It is a cockier, more aggressive Kirk than we've all grown up with. It is a character that we all know is an asshole, but love to see him win anyway. Pine's performance brings with it a self-assuredness and a wink and a smile that at once reminds us of Shatner's Kirk, while maintaining a fresh and new take on the character.<br/><br/>That's all i can say right now. I have to give it a day or two to fully germinate in my brain, what i just witnessed. I think i agree with one criticism I read over the Internet - that this film feels like a first act of a much larger arc. I agree with this, not in the sense that it's the first part of a multi-film story arc, but rather that it is a flick that neatly sets up the characters and Universe for additional adventures. The film leaves the audience wanting MORE. And that leads me to my biggest criticism about the storyline: the film would benefit GREATLY with another half hour of story thrown in there. The film needed breathing room. I wanted to inhabit this world up on the screen for a little while longer and explore it a bit more before we blow it all up. It's my hope that subsequent films flesh this Universe out more comprehensively. I want to see more more more. My biggest kudos for the storyline is one word: consequences. I have gotten too used to Star Trek TV shows where everything is reset at the end of the episode and then next week neither the crew nor the ship is worse for the wear. In this movie though there are consequences; DIRE consequences that are not reversed with a magical reset button.<br/><br/>For the next flick here's what I want to see:<br/><br/><ul><li>Some truly ""alien"" environments. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Carol Marcus. She would be a great character to have. In the old time line she was the mother of Kirk's only son, David (Star Trek 2 and 3).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Klingons maybe? Not sure about this. In earlier movies there was a ton of back story from which to build possible future films, everything is so wide open now it's hard to decide where they should head next for the sequel! Perhaps Kang or Koloth, Klingon characters from TOS, could show up for Kirk's nemesis.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>More alien life forms. - More scenes set on Earth, showing us how things have changed over the course of 2 and a half centuries.</li></ul><br/><br/>PS: Bruce Greenwood was awesome as Captain Pike! The man has some gravitas in this flick. When this guy tells you to get your sh!t together, you listen!"
"TAEMO","8","3","8","13 May 2009"," That was fast! (Spoilers)
","Star Trek was fast, even faster than The Last Crusade. Indy3 is one of my all time favorite movies, and I consider it to be the best popcorn movie there is. It is so fast and so good that you tend to overlook all the stupid things and coincidences and there are quiet a lot. For example, when young Indy whistles for his horse and right after the horse come the bad guys in the car. But the movie is so good, you just overlook all that stuff. Star Trek is faster, but it does not lend itself as easily to suspension of disbelief. The coincidences are too obvious. For example why SpockPrime and Kirk are on the same planet, same continent, same cave. It is hard to swallow that. Why does the black hole in the beginning lead Nero exactly to that time and place it does to meet the USS Kelvin, why Old Spock comes out of the black hole just in time so that Kirk is matured into a young man and is ready to battle Nero. These coincidences are grand.<br/><br/>The character moments in Indy3 are top notch. Indy talking to his father aboard the airship, discussing their plan on the motorcycle and the end of course where Henry calls his son Indy for the first time and Indy subsequently lets go of the grail and can be saved. Those moments never feel rushed or too short, they are, just perfect. In Star Trek, they feel a little rushed, it is just about acceptable. And the character moments are not bad. They are very good, just a little too fast. They are so fast and they take place in odd places. For example when Spock leaves the bridge after his planet imploded, Uhura comes after him and they talk in the turbo lift. The same when Spock leaves the Bridge after he was relived of his command. He goes to the transporter room? Does not he have quarters? Perhaps they did not have enough money to build the sets. <br/><br/>About the sets. In TLC the sets were perfect. You always believed that a certain interior set belonged to the exterior establishing shot. In Star Trek that is not always the case. The sets in general. I like them just so. The bridge is nice. What is absolutely unacceptable is the use of industrial locations for the bowels of the ship. You just do not believe you are still aboard the Enterprise when the action shifts to engineering or the shuttle bay. That pulls me out of the movie and that is not good. <br/><br/>The action and the SFX in Indy3 are perfect. Granted, some of the special effects look a bit dated by now, for example the plane dog fight, but oddly enough it does not detract from the movie. (Some of the mate lines were removed in the DVD versions) The action sequences are inserted so seamlessly, they come and go so fast, you do not even realize that you are in one, and when you do, they are over. (plane battle, plane car chase, tank vs. horse) The action in StarTrek is pretty good and the effects are top notch. The life action and the FX blend flawlessly, also because the lens flare that dominates the life action cinematography is copied in the CG stuff. Were it not for the industrial interior Enterprise sets, the movie would feel completely rounded. <br/><br/>What I do not like, and I am afraid that future movies will bring more of it, is the shaky camera and the quick cuts that Bourne 2 and 3 director Paul Greengras pioneered. You can not relish a good special effect when you do not see it properly. But hey, that is how Abrahms envisioned the movie, that is the way it is done. Certainly a great artistic achievement, to uphold the style, the pace and the look throughout the entire movie but it is to fast and flashy for my taste.<br/><br/>J. J.'s character direction and scene setups are a double edged sword for me. Theere are good scenes, some very good, but the Kobayashy Maru Test was a joke. Could Kirk be more pretentious and casual when facing Star Fleet's hardest test? And little bit more seriousness would have made the scene much better and not degraded it into a mere joke. And it was too fast. Too slow on the other hand was the Spock, Kirk scene on the ice planet. Are not they in a hurry? Do not they want to find the outpost? Need not Kirk get back to the ship? Yet they sit there, having a talk and barbecue around a log fire. (Where did they get the logs on a ice planet. Christmas trees?)<br/><br/>The music in the Indy movie was great, had the best music in any Indy movie, the best themes. The Star Trek score is great also, Kirk's theme is cool, the title theme is beautiful, although I missed the fanfare. I wonder why the film's composer was not allowed to use it.<br/><br/>The acting was very good, the casting perfect. They had so many actors from so many different genres, their fans alone would have made the movie a blockbuster. But since the movie is so appealing to a general audience it is/will be a huge success. It will bring in a lot of new fans. The sad thing is, I think that most of the old fans, as myself, do not think the movie to be so good. And do not get me wrong, I do not think it is a bad movie, and I hope it will make a lot of money and bring us seven sequels, but as a fan, I am a little bit disappointed. If the movie took its time, if it was a little bit more traditional, it could have been so much better."

","I can see how this movie would upset devotees of the vapid Roddenberry/Berman/Piller version of the Star Trek universe. It pretty much puts back all the unforgivable ""mistakes"" and ""flaws"" of the original series that these fans thought Next Gen had ""corrected."" In place of the idealized, mentally-hygienic, practically carved in marble heroes they seem to prefer, it gives us a bunch of weird, violent, sexed-up, imperfect, and very human characters. And it has illogical elements and plot holes - while of course there were none in the ""new, improved"" Trek shows. Let's face it - compared to Next Gen, this movie is a train wreck.<br/><br/>The thing is, watching a train wreck - a passenger train at that - is more interesting than watching a train full of people who have no problems rolling smoothly along on perfectly level tracks while discussing the physics of train travel. Which is sort of what watching Next Gen is like. <br/><br/>So frankly, despite its flaws, I welcome the new Trek with enthusiasm. It's a mess, but it's a creative, exciting, emotionally-engaging, adventurous mess. If you want to have fun - see this movie now. If not, stay home and watch ""Pen Pals"" a few times. Maybe you'll change your mind about trains."

","I saw this movie last week and it was awesome! Anyone could watch this movie - you don't have to be a trekkie to appreciate the visuals, story and acting. I have to say, the actors were superb! I was skeptical of the new and young looking Kirk until he actually came onto the screen and I have to say, he did a wonderful job. I thought he, Spock and McCoy and Scottie were just great.<br/><br/>It was weird to see Karl Urban play the doctor as I'm so used to watching him in more action figure roles. However, he played his part really well. My favourite actor was Simon Pegg who played Montgomery Scott. He brought a new life and sense of humour into the movie. This movie does not have one boring moment. Eric Banner, who plays the villain, didn't have a very large physical role but all credit goes to him for acting it well. Great movie to watch!"

","FINALLY a spin-off/update/remake/tribute/big-screen version of a much loved TV show that DOESN'T disappoint. I'd become so disenchanted with such so-called blockbusters but Star Trek is an absolute thrill from beginning to end. There's a pretty seamless weaving of ST lore with really nicely observed prequel characterisations of all the main characters.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie though, is the wonderful casting, which makes you believe completely that these characters ARE the younger versions of Spock, Kirk and Bones. Its not often the Casting Director gets kudos in a feature, but this is one who deserves as many plaudits as the director or stars themselves. It is absolutely immaculate casting, and the actors have then improved on their basic similarities with lovely, understated but wholly authentic body-language, facial expressions and tonal inflections which are a joy to watch. Simon Pegg as Scottie didn't really convince me as a precursor to the dour Scot we all know and love, but was fun nonetheless and delivered some classic lines with gusto.<br/><br/>The plot rolls along and there's a good mixture of action and character development.<br/><br/>HERE COMES THE LITTLE SPOILER ***** The ONLY bum note in the whole movie is the weird, unmotivated Spock/Uhura kissing!

","Even through i've watched pretty much every Star Trek Show at some point(especially TNG), i've never been that much of a Trekkie. But what i've always been is fascinated with long running media franchises like Trek. And to make it possible for a franchise to be and stay successful it has to reinvent itself, which every fan should admit was the necessary and right thing to do for Star Trek at this point. IMO with this movie the task to give another Generation it's Star Trek was a absolute success, which should make everyone who likes the series happy.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie had its problems like obviously trying a little to hard plotwise, as well as far as the drama goes. But what made the movie as entertaining as it was to me was the balance, which from my point of view pretty much every single aspect of it reflected. Starting with making it as much enjoyable for Trekkies as for your average moviegoer. I actually watched it with a hardcore fan on one hand and another guy who pretty much doesn't know anything about Trek other than Kirk and Spock. And they both liked it.<br/><br/>Another thing was that they finally had some real good action stuff in there, but at the same time didn't forget to develop the characters. Furthermore did the movie not take itself too seriously, had a good amount of humor (something i've always liked about the later movies with the original crew), without being cheesy.<br/><br/>All in all, the only thing left to say is, that Star Trek is definitely back to live long and prosper."
"dropout237","9","3","8","12 May 2009"," Great movie. Just enjoy it
","Went to Star Trek last Saturday with a friend. From the opening scenes to the closing credits it blasted across the screen with such confidence that I was blown away. Don't get caught up with 'canon'. What a load of bull. Go to the movies to enjoy the experience, not to poke holes in them.<br/><br/>The plot cleverly changes all that we have come to know and love from Trek into an unknown future for all the characters. I think this is a great way to move Trek forward without knowing what is to come. Wrath of Khan, maybe just a minor tantrum? Tribbles, maybe with teeth? Who knows what Trek will give us in the future, but that is what storytelling is all about. Don't wait for the DVD, or worse, illegally download it. See this movie where its meant to be see... in the cinema."
"alr126","8","3","8","11 May 2009"," What can I say?
","Where to start? <br/><br/>JJ Abrams did a fantastic job with the special FX. He paid so much attention to detail everywhere. When viewing the outside of the Enterprise for the first time, one could almost feel as if it was he or she approaching her for boarding, it looked that real. Kudos to Mr. Abrams. <br/><br/>I also thought the casting was top-notch. The characters chosen to portray the classic figures were spot-on. From Kirk to Spock to McCoy and even Scotty. <br/><br/>It's kind of hard to write a story that could seem plausible using the technology at that time. While this may seem foolish because the technology is fictional, a writer still has to stay within certain parameters. For very short periods throughout the movie, I felt as if it was a little hokey, maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was just me. <br/><br/>I gave this film an 8 because, again, at times it felt a little hokey, not what I wanted from a Star Trek film, I've experienced to many hokey Star Trek movies in the past. <br/><br/>Regardless, of all that, I highly recommend this movie. It was a good swashbuckling space adventure, kind of in the spirit of films 50 years older without all the special affects."
"glennrparker","8","3","8","11 May 2009"," Bolding going.....
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Very cool reboot. I thought all the cast were amazing, but especially Kirk and McCoy. You could really believe that they were younger versions of the characters we know, even down to the same mannerisms and tone of voice. Loved the production design, how the technology and uniforms blended with the original series and yet still seemed new. Loved the use of several lines from previous movies - ""I am and always shall be your friend"" is from Star Trek II and III, while Spock's line about whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth, is from Star Trek VI. Loved other little nods like how the Centauri slug is basically the same as the Ceti eels from Star Trek II. Loved how the first guy we saw wearing a red uniform was really gun-ho and stayed alive about 30 seconds, again in keeping with the original series. There was even a nod to Alias in there with the big ball of red matter.<br/><br/>Glad they didn't kill off Christopher Pike as I think that would have been rewriting continuity a little too far. It would have taken things into Alien 3 territory when they killed off most of the survivors from Aliens in the first 30 seconds of the movie, which it didn't recover from. <br/><br/>But established Star Trek continuity has been drastically rewritten now anyway. No Captain Robert April (first commanding officer of the Enterprise) and no more Vulcan, but let's face it Vulcans are very dull anyway. I could have done without most of their episodes in the TV series.<br/><br/>My only worry is that after this excellent start, things are allowed to slide again and we end up bored with Trek a few more years down the track. Unless of course they just don't make anymore, which might be a good idea. I'd like to see JJ Abrams lending his talents to other great films other than Trek, as he is once of the best creative minds out there."

"FoxWolf87","8","3","8","10 May 2009"," Nowhere Near the Old Star Trek... But It's Good.
","I really thought this one would suck. I'm a fan of the Star Trek series, and when I heard it was a prequel, I thought it was a terrible idea. When I heard it was a reboot, I didn't like the idea of just eliminating the universe I liked. I also read some of the negative reviews by other Star Trek fans and wasn't encouraged. But, it really is good and I would be lying if I said I hated it. It was actually very well made.<br/><br/>No. It's not on the same plane as the other Star Treks. This one, is popcorn fun action sci-fi. The other series are concept and character driven thought-provoking morality plays and dramas (With some exceptions. There is a lot of God awful old Star Trek floating about too. {Season 3 of TOS, Star trek V, and Season 2 of Enterprise come to mind})<br/><br/>But if you accept this as entertainment, and you don't get stuck in the rigid dogma of Gene's assumed vision (Trekkies), or the preconceived notion that Star Trek is for nerds (jocks) you will find a very entertaining summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>STRENGTHS - The action is great. The effects are mostly incredible. The actors (with the exception of Chekov {But he's not that bad}) really nail the essence of the characters. The dialogue is good. The pacing is a little fast, but it's meant to be fast, and it keeps you engaged.<br/><br/>WEAKNESSES - 2 very obvious ad placements. Strongly emotional events are happening, but the story moves too fast to focus on them. Sulu becomes a little bit of a stereotype. There are some illogical plot elements. And actually (I love the original Star Trek timeline but...) I would've preferred more separation from the original universe. S<br/><br/>Also some of the Enterprise sets look more like a treatment plant than a starship.<br/><br/>However, overall, this is really good. It's not the same as the original Star Trek series', but that doesn't make it bad. I would've preferred that they stuck with the old timeline, but really, they didn't know what to do with it, and neither did anyone else, so they took the only logical course. A well-made reboot to appeal to a general audience.<br/><br/>This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone (not just the hard-core fans), but anyone who wants to see a good action film.<br/><br/>8/10. Good action film. Some flaws, but not enough to make it a bad movie."
"Rafacus","9","3","8","10 May 2009"," The authentic casting makes this a must-see.
","If the main goal of Star Trek was to win over general audiences then I think they succeeded. With likable characters, top-notch special effects and a solid story, this nerd's epic hit the box office with the sonic boom from a roaring thruster. Zachary Quinto's Spock and Chris Pine's James T. Kirk are not only convincing but are near perfect in their matching to the original series. The characters are instantly recognizable by looks and accents and Eric Bana's Nero Romulan will drive fear into you and your planet.<br/><br/>No doubt like all Sci-Fi remakes of our age, the die-hards will find something to diss on in the movie (I think these winners are called Trekkers). I mean it does miss the mark on delivering the stiff, robotic fighting and the flashing bulbs from the original series but for average Joe, this could easily be one of the best Space-Aged movies ever. Though the use of lens flare was a bit on the ""a little too much"" scale, the feel of the Enterprise's bridge and the relationships among the crew came off as genuine and well acted. My only regret in seeing it was not experiencing it in full IMAX glory.<br/><br/>The scenes that struck the best chord with me was aboard the Enterprise itself, though the Space and explosions were pretty, the bridge had a feeling of advanced technology and I liked the look of the Romulans. Simon Pegg's Scotty and Karl Urban's McCoy will no doubt be fan favorites and Zoe Saldana's Uhura will have the young men in the audience drooling. The full cast really grips you throughout the entire movie and it was enough to make me forget that Tyler Perry was in the movie.<br/><br/>So J.J. Abrams has pulled it off, he has taken the most nerdiest of obsessive nerd shows and made it absolutely watchable to the regular person. Although the speedy plot will not win any awards, the character interaction, menacing bad guys and the authentic casting makes it a must-see.<br/><br/>More reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com"
"hugh_booth","3","3","8","9 May 2009"," Generally fun, but a big dumb movie.
","This movie was well cast, but unfortunately not the reboot of the franchise one might have hoped for. It does succeed as an adventure film, keeping the audience entertained, but there isn't much else. Many people have been singing its praises, however, the movie is genuinely unremarkable. As a Star Trek film it fails, with a weak story line that doesn't make much sense within the canon that still needs to be considered. As a Sci Fi film it fails with a plot that falls apart on simple science, let alone major sci fi concepts.<br/><br/>The revenge plot doesn't make a lot of sense from the outset. Our villain Nero is basically upset because Spock and the Federation failed to save Romulus in the late 24th century (100+ years in the future). It seems that a supernova threatened the galaxy, and despite Ambassador Spock's promise, he failed to save Romulus. The problem is, supernovas don't threaten galaxies. They don't expand in an infinite blast wave that wipes out countless star systems. In short, the concept behind the destruction of the planet was ridiculous.<br/><br/>From a Trek standpoint, there is then the question of how the Romulans were presented in this future. You would think that they were a helpless refugee race utterly dependent on the benevolent support of Spock and the Federation to save them. You would never guess that they were a huge Empire with a military rivaling Starfleet. In short, it would be a little like the Russians blaming the US because they were unable to stop the meteor that was going to land on Moscow. It becomes clear that the writing staff didn't bother getting any kind of picture of the state of the Trek universe before their time travel tampering set big changes in motion.<br/><br/>Visually, they obviously had to make many changes to the sets and special effects to update it from the sixties. Unfortunately they made a few too many changes purely in the name of being different. On the lighter side were warp speed effects that tossed twenty-five seasons and four movies of established shots (along with a lack of knowledge of how fast ships had been a century before Kirk). More serious were the engineering sets. Taking the idea of an industrial look to the extreme, one could easily mistake main engineering for a waterworks or a brewery. Aside from the lack of anything that actually looked like an engine (Star Trek style or otherwise), it just didn't make much structural sense.<br/><br/>The movie itself could have been much better. Though some might argue that they didn't need to know much about Trek because it's a reboot, it doesn't take that much to make sure your story holds up, without beating your audience over the head with minutia. Unfortunately the examples which hold the story to canon (gee they mention Cardassians) really don't come across as anything more than an attempt to cover the fact that the writers and director didn't learn much about the core material.<br/><br/>Paramount has shown once again that they are clueless as to why the franchise is dieing. First and foremost you need a coherent (preferably smart) storyline to compliment the characters. Beyond that an attempt to keep track of continuity is useful. Further one should at least try to understand basic science when making a fantastical science fiction film."

","I have never seen an episode of Star Trek in my life and know nothing of previous movies of the show, but decided to tag along with a few friends to see the opening. I am not one to give any spoilers, so simply put, it is a great movie. Star Trek is full of action, great special effects, and scenes of suspense. Not only is it greatly entertaining, but there are laughs throughout. Even with the little knowledge I have of Star Trek, I can confidently say each actor does a superb job carrying their role throughout the film. Star Trek is as easy to follow as it is to enjoy, and you will not be lost if even you are a non-Trekkie. Highly recommended."
"gallae","8","3","8","8 May 2009"," A long term StarTrek Fan's review
","I have been anticipating this film more than any other in the last year and a half. A film about Kirk, Spock and the rest during their academy days? This was mooted ages ago but instead we got Nemesis which while very well produced, was less than satisfactory. In fact it looked like that film almost ""killed the franchise"". That being the case, and the fact that J.J. Abrams was producer on Lost and Cloverfield made me a little uncertain as to what I'd see.  I've been a fan of Trek ever since I watched it in the 60s, so I'm hard to please.<br/><br/>What makes or breaks a Star Trek film is the script, always - how it treats the characters, how it hangs together in the Star Trek universe both in background details and also in continuity. This is why The Wrath of Khan  and The Voyage Home are overall good films, and The Final Frontier and Insurrection are not. The former seem to fit well in the Star Trek universe, the latter don't. This film however is well written, even if the plot does depend upon apparent chance and coincidence to a huge degree.<br/><br/>When they started making more than one series of Star Trek, there was a tradition of including a character from the previous series, or a recent film. They've done that in this too, and for me that helped make it ""Trek"". I also loved the inclusion of green women and Captain Pike, who were both in the pilot to the original series. :) A real test of whether or not Star Trek is a ""modern mythology"" like comics is whether or not it survives a change of actors. There was a long tradition in the TV series and films that original actors always played their characters whenever possible. In this film however (with one exception) that isn't the case. How much were the character of Kirk, Spock and McCoy derived from the character of Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley? It'd be tempting as a fan to believe that all of it was. The actors of the new film however do such a good job that the characters are still recognizable.<br/><br/>When McCoy says ""I'm a Doctor, not a physicist!"" (as you know he will) it's right rather than parody or pastiche. I found myself guessing how the characters would react or talk (based on my experience of the series and films) and most times I was right, so I'm satisfied with their portrayal in the film (even if Checkov was left with ""the comm"" more than once - gasp).<br/><br/>The problem that Abrams had of course was how to do a ""prequel"" without running into all manner of problems with continuity? Enterprise faced the same problem and the solution there was to introduce a ""time war"" in which future agents interfered in past events and thus changed the time line to various alternate presents. While that sounds like a cop-out it actually had many precedents in the TV shows, including the original series.  Most of the time however, the result was use of the ""reset button"" in which the original time-line is restored. Well, without going into spoilers too much for this film, time travel is involved, but this time the ""reset button"" isn't used.  What we end up with is actually predictable - pretty much the same line-up of the original series of characters in the original series (nurse Chapel is mentioned but not seen), but not exactly the same temperaments of history (which can be blamed on the root event of the film). And because this is an alternate time-line we're now in, future writers are free to write whatever adventures and developments they like.<br/><br/>This is a ""reboot"" rather than a ""reset"" button, and this is quite clear in the credits with one character having ""prime"" appended to their name. There's already a sequel in the works, though I could even believe a new TV series could be launched by the film too - otherwise why use the original theme at the end (a very nice touch)? Wishful thinking perhaps. :) So for me, a very long term fan, they got this film right, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if it does make my complete collection of ""Star Trek fact files"" obsolete."
"Kevin_turner_5","9","3","8","8 May 2009"," Warp Speed
","In death there is rebirth, the death of the Star Trek came to the screen as Nemesis. The movie that was reborn is Star Trek. This movie raised the bar for prequels and any Star Trek film, with the exception of Wrath of Kahn and First Contact. The acting was paramount, they fit the parts with perfection. The visual's were top tier, it wasn't shaky or anything like Cloverfield if any one has concerns. You feel like your in 2230, and everything falls in place, you see a higher budget Enterprise, the way it should be, you see actual parts of the ship and engineering things that the older movies couldn't have. The comedy is perfect, there's quite a bit of reference to the Star Trek universe for the fans, which brings me to my gripe about the movie.<br/><br/>The only bad thing which is tiny, is if you know nothing about Star Trek, you will not Fully understand the villain, and his hatred will seem unjustified. Every one should see this movie, ladies its OK to go with your boyfriends this movie has a lot of emotion in it and a nice love story and compassion in it."

I wished the origins would last like 30mins and then we would actually watch some REAL adventures. All this friendship drama and how they got united felt like a TV episode and not a movie to pay for. I wasn't surprised at all and didn't feel any excitement through out the movie. Quinto was excellent,but the guy who portrayed captain Kerk was very very boring and too""all American."" I missed the style, i missed the ""where no man has gonebefore"" and the unknown. Under my opinion, there's potential to the newseries, but i'd wait a couple more of their films until the Enterprisecrew reaches it's full potential and we can actually enjoy a really exciting sci-fi adventure."
"moviewizguy","9","5","17","10 May 2009"," The future begins.
","The film explores the back stories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens to destroy the United Federation of Planets.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Trekkie (is that how you spell it?) in any way nor have I seen a single second of the Star Trek universe in my entire life. In fact, I never really wanted to watch the films in the first place because they never interested me. However, since the fantastic J.J. Abrams was on board, I knew I should see this film. To my relief, the film was great. In fact, it's the best movie I've seen this year thus far!<br/><br/>If you find yourself almost teary in the first few minutes of this film, you know it'll be good. The film is character driven. There's a lot of action sequences, yes, but the film is really character driven. In fact, the high point of the film was its characters and the casting made it possible. From a glance, Chris Pine doesn't seem like the ""right"" person to be in the movie. After all, he doesn't have a good track record for the movies he has starred in so far. However, he really does a great job playing the charismatic, smart talk guy. Zachary Quinto does an equally exceptional job as Spock, a name I've heard so many times without knowing who he really was. Eric Bana plays an almost unrecognizable performance as the ""villain."" Simon Pegg and Karl Urban play the comedic relief characters. And to wrap the diverse ensemble up, Zoe Saldana, Ben Cross, John Cho, and Winona Ryder give us each a unique performance.<br/><br/>Apart from the cast, the action sequences were amazing, along with the special effects. The score by the underrated Michael Giacchino is great, especially hearing the theme song for the first time. However, the story is also really great. I didn't realize this was a time movie at first. I found it mentally stimulating. The laid back feel and the slapstick humor adds to the immense satisfaction when the credits roll.<br/><br/>The film is really good because there's almost nothing bad to say about it. Yes, maybe you can find one small detail here and there that doesn't make the film perfect, but no movies are perfect. This movie is human, with sharp dialogue, and fantastic characters, a complex story, with action sequences to fill on top. If you haven't seen a summer movie yet, make this your first one. As you can see, the film is very accessible for non-Trekkies. However, I'm sure the die-hard Trekkies will appreciate the new, fresh zest Abrams have brought into the film."

"webmaster-2064","10","6","22","29 April 2009"," Great movie, worth watchin on the BIG screen
","Just wanted to tell you, I went to see the new Star Trek movie yesterday evening. I don't know if you're familiar with Star Trek story or not. Personally I wasn't. I think I must have seen or two of the latest movie they've made, but I've never seen any of the series.<br/><br/>So if you're like me. Don't worry, you don't really need to know the story to understand the movie. Mostly because it happens before the series, and tells the youth of the main characters and how they got to know each other and end up on the Enterprise (kinda like what they did with Batman Begins).<br/><br/>Now onto the movie itself. It was GREAT. Really, really great. I had seen the trailer and knew it looked promising, but I wasn't expecting it to be so great.<br/><br/>Special effects: Really awesome. I hadn't been to the Kino in a long time and movie I saw which had lots of effects was probably Matrix 3, and woah they really learned how to do better effects since. And seeing it on the big screen really makes it more intense than at home.<br/><br/>Action: LOTS of action. Spaceships going boom, hand-to-hand fight. It's intense and not boring at all.<br/><br/>Story: It was interesting. Like I said I'm not too familiar with the TV Series so I don't know the mythology well. But I think they've kinda respected it. And they also pulled a rabbit out of their hat that allows them to go slightly a different way from the series. I'm not going to say to much, cause it would be spoilers, but it all makes sense in the end. Other bonus: there was a lot of humour here and there, which makes the movie very enjoyable and really balances well the action sequences.<br/><br/>Characters: I think pretty much everyone was well casted and they all had a pretty good chemistry. Again I had not seen the original characters too much. But from what I know, yeah the new ones are great. Special mention to Zachary Quinto (the guy who plays Sylar in Heroes) who makes a really really really great Spock. Other bonus point: you get to see Leonard Nimoy (the guy who played Spock in the original series) quite a lot. I thought he was maybe just going to make a small cameo or something, but no, he really is important to the story.<br/><br/>Music: The soundtrack was done by the same guy who made the music on Alias and Lost so I kinda recognised his style every now and then. It was also well made. Bonus point: there were time where there was no music, pretty much just silence. I think this must have happened twice, just before a heavy action sequence. I've always found this to be a great way to intensified the moment.<br/><br/>So yeah overall a very good movie. And if you're into sci-fi things like I am, I really recommend you to go see it. It's really worth watching it on the big screen."

I get that trekkies are older and you're looking for new blood, new fans to watch Star Trek films and spend lots of money, but this was surely the least best option you had, I mean you should at least have thought "" we have a good fan base so let's be sure not to piss them off and alienate them, then along comes JJ and does just that.

So, I'm writing this as an outsider so I have no feelings going into the film in regards to anything that does or doesn't happen and how things might be different than what came before this. What story is here centers on Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) as the two must put aside their differences to try and stop an evil leader (Eric Bana) who plans on destroying just about everything he can. I guess it should be said that this is a rather amazing production that has one great action scene after another. The visual look of the film is quite amazing and it always amuses me to watch something like this and know that there are people out there with this type of imagination that can really open up and let stuff like this fly out. The CGI-effects are mighty impressive and even the cast members, for the most part, offer up nice performances. I'd also add that Abrams handles all the material extremely well and delivers not only a brilliant look but the action scenes all try to top the previous one. With that said, there's a lot to look at but there's very little heart or soul to be had. Perhaps fans of the series or previous movies will disagree but to me this was just one big action picture full of eye candy but nothing else in terms of a story. The CGI effects, while great, take up 98% of everything we see so they are the movie and not the characters, their actions or anything else. I'm certainly not expecting Bergman here but I did expect a little more. This is certainly a summer blockbuster at its highest levels in terms of action, explosions and all around spectacle, which will be reason enough for millions to view it and enjoy it."

","I just saw Star Trek at a local multiplex two nights ago and wanted to comment on it.From the beginning where James T.Kirk is born as his father sacrifices his ship and life to stop the villainous Nero,to Kirk and Spock growing up,tho the battles and climax,this is one hell of a movie and does it's roots proud.The cast is perfect.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto shine as Kirk and Spock,and Eric Bana is a perfect villain.They are all good,but particular standouts are Karl Urban who is utterly perfect as ""Bones"" McCoy and Simon Pegg,who is hilarious as Scotty.Kudos also for getting Leonard Nimoy to return as the elder Spock.The special effects are stupendous and Michael Giacchino's score is wonderful. All possible praise must be showered upon director/producer J.J.Abrams and screenwriters/executive producers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman for honoring and bettering our beloved original Star Trek.A warp-driven 10 out of 10!!!"
"Lenz-El","8","4","13","25 May 2009"," A Visually Stunning and Immensely Entertaining Ride!
","Now, am no Trekkie and have no knowledge of the Star Trek franchise besides William Shatner was the Captain Kirk of the original 1960s TV series, Patrick Stewart was the captain of the 90s series, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Whoopi Goldberg made some appearances on that show. So when hearing about this film as not interesting as Star Trek has been revered as geek religion and had little appeal to those who weren't familiar with it's history. But when I saw the trailer for the film, I was pretty surprised at how good it looked and the fact that J.J. Abrams (""Alias"", ""Lost"") was directing only got me more interested in the film. After the film was released, I heard good things about the film and decided to check it out. I'm glad to say that ""Star Trek"" was great film with not only some exciting action and breath taking special effects, but there's enough distinction between keeping the mythology of the franchise intact and introducing it to a new audience who have no knowledge of Star Trek. Of course, you'll be lost when certain alien species are described or terms like ""warp seed"" are used, but overall, you'll find yourself very engrossed in the film's story as well as it's various characters.<br/><br/>The best aspect of the film is without a doubt the strong acting from a relatively unknown cast. Not only do all the actors play their roles very convincingly, but their individual character moments really add that needed depth to a summer blockbuster that often turns into an action fest with little emotional investment. I can't really say which character was the best, but I know the standouts were Chris Pine as the tough, womanizing and future captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise, James T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as the brooding, complex half human/half Vulcan, Spock. In the original series, Kirk and Spock are the best of friends and trusted companion and while I have knowledge of their history, its interesting seeing how both men grew up as troubled youths and became rivals before becoming the iconic duo that Trekkies all. In all their scenes, Chris Pine effectively finds a balance between arrogance and confidence that makes Kirk the lead hero you root for and Zachary Quinto does a stunning job of showing Spock conflict between controlling his human emotions and being a strong willed Vulcan who must always follow the code of a captain. But while the film does focus more on the rivalry between Kirk and Spock, the rest of the cast again have their moments of where they get to define their characters rightfully. There's Karl Urban who does a fine job as the space fearing Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, Zoe Saldana is both sexy and strong as Uhura, the alien linguist/communications expert of the Enterprise, John Cho gets to show off his impressive fight skills as Hikaru Sulu, the pilot of the Enterprise and both Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov and Simon Pegg as Montgomery Scott bring more than just comic relief to their colorful characters. You also have great supporting roles with Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Morrison as Kirk's parents, Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike, an almost unrecognizable Winona Ryder as Spock's mother, surprisingly Tyler Perry as Admiral Richard Barnett and even the original Spock himself, Leonard Nimoy who is an integral part of the story. My only fault with one casting choice/character and my only gripe with the film is Eric Bana as the villainous Romulan, Nero. I don't really fault's Bana's performance too much as Nero never really comes off as a strong antagonist and is rather one-dimensional most of the time.<br/><br/>Besides that, the story moves very smoothly with little plot holes and J.J. Abrams does some of his finest direction here. Not to mention, ""Star Trek"" easily beats out Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" as the most visually stunning film in recent years! The cinematography is perfection and successfully compliments the story that's being told. The special effects, once again, are top notch and dazzling. Also, the costumes, set pieces etc. have been masterfully modernized and polished for the new age of the Star Trek. A franchise that has been called dead has been remarkably revived in this sci-fi spectacle that is both character driven and visually compelling. ""Star Trek"" has enough freshness and entertainment to satisfy both long time Trekkies and new audience who could easily became fans after watching this film. I am already anticipating the sequel and can't wait to see the next adventure of the newest incarnation of the U.S.S. Enterprise."
"Donkey_Hotay","9","4","13","25 May 2009"," As good an action film as you will see
","For the most part, negative reviews of this film come from fans of the original TV series who are disappointed about the remake's ""unfaithfulness"" to Gene Roddenberry's universe. I have read reviews, for instance, disparaging the new film's intellectual inadequacies, or its lack of a tidy, coherent moral message--to loyal fans, these were an integral part of what made ""Trek"" so fascinating and ahead of its time. <br/><br/>But in enumerating the myriad ways that the new Trek differs from the old, the die-hards are completely missing the point. They are simply reinforcing what has been made explicitly clear: this is not Roddenberry's Star Trek, but J.J. Abram's. <br/><br/>And when we judge Abram's Trek on its own merits, it is quite difficult to dislike. This Trek is able to transmit much of the wonder and excitement of the original, while excelling in aspects where the older series lagged. One such aspect, of course, is special effects--even most Trekkies will be excited that their beloved Enterprise now has an arsenal truly fit for the 23rd century.<br/><br/>Regardless of its detractors, the film isn't pure muscle and action--the young actors excel in their challenging roles, and the writing is sharp, witty, and, yes, intelligent! The end result is a Star Trek re-make much like (I would suggest) a Lord of the Rings re-make: a quality film which stakes out new territory, but which is able to harness the compelling uniqueness of the original universe."
"Reel_starz","8","4","13","25 May 2009"," A bold and immensely satisfying adventure
","When I walked into the theater, I barely knew anything about Star Trek. My knowledge consisted of a few character names and other tidbits I had picked up, mostly from reviews of this very movie. However, luckily for me, while there are probably some in-jokes and subtleties that I missed, it did not matter. My ignorance of Trekkie-lore did not hinder my enjoyment of an expertly-made and thoroughly entertaining movie. While I would not say that J.J. Abram's Star Trek is quite on par with The Dark Knight or even Batman Begins, which were both movies that successfully rebooted a failing franchise just like Star Trek, I agree with what many critics and audience members have been saying since the sci-fi movie first hit theaters: it is phenomenal for the way it managed to please fans of the original series while still welcoming newbies like me.<br/><br/>One of the first things worth noting is the stellar ensemble cast. While no single performance stands out, though both Chris Pine as James T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock come rather close, every cast member gets a moment to shine and they all take advantage of that opportunity. Though they are relatively new to the movie industry, Pine and Quinto do a brilliant job as the two main characters and their relationship, which changes from one of mutual hate to something more amiable, develops extremely well, largely due to their unique chemistry. As the villain, Eric Bana brings just the right amount of menace and, strangely, humanity, allowing the audience to sympathize with his cause without compromising the evil nature of his character. Other performances that deserve mention are Karl Urban as Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy, John Cho as Mr. Sulu, Simon Pegg as the quirky but intelligent Scotty and Anton Yelchin as a very Russian Chekov. Zoe Saldana does a fine job as Uhura but her character lacks the development and distinctive personality of the others as, though some comes through occasionally, she turns into little more than a love interest.<br/><br/>Other than the fantastic cast, an infinite amount of credit for the movie's success should go to director J.J. Abrams. As a fan of Lost, I was ecstatic when I heard the praise reviewers were giving Abrams, and after seeing the movie, I completely concur with everything people have said about him. Given the amount of effort put into the film, it's surprising that he was, in fact, not originally a fan of Star Trek, yet that actually seems to be more of a good thing because he approached the movie as a newcomer, enabling him to tell the story without getting bogged down in the mythology as a die-hard fan might have done. Of course, he could only achieve all of this with the help of producer Damon Lindelof and writers Roborto Orzi and Alex Kurtzman, all of whom also worked with him on Lost. They all did a great job of developing the characters and combining action, romance, drama and science fiction into a credible, gripping story. The dialogue was clever, often funny, and occasionally cheesy, though that is not necessarily a bad thing. Also, there is enough emotion to make the audience - even non-Trekkies - care about the characters, many of whom are not even human, but it never becomes sappy or overly melodramatic.<br/><br/>Last come the techs. The cinematography was very good and the visual effects, while nothing groundbreaking, were nonetheless quite spectacular. Fortunately, unlike many modern blockbusters, Star Trek does not fall into the trap of relying on special effects or action; in fact, the action is always secondary to the characters and story. The score by Michael Giacchino finds the right chord between heroically uplifting and urgent. It never distracts from the movie itself, instead emphasizing the tone or emotion of a particular scene and lending the film an almost epic feel.<br/><br/>Initially, I was conflicted between seeing this or Terminator Salvation, which just came out, in theaters. A combination of impressively good reviews and word-of-mouth, the enticing trailer, a promising looking cast and, of course, J.J. Abrams convinced me to see Star Trek, and I in no way regret my choice. While I have not been converted to a hardcore Trekkie, nor do I think I ever will, I will certainly be interested in any sequels that come out in the future. May this franchise and the careers of all those involved live long and prosper."

","First of all i want to say that i am not a fan of Star Trek. I have never watched an TV-show or see any movie about Star Trek. But me and my friends were bored and we decided to give this movie a change and go see it and we were all amazed !<br/><br/>This movie is totally awesome. The most brilliant visual effects that i have ever seen since Transformers probably. All the actors were awesome and fitted the characters good. I loved Simon Pegg as Scotty and Chris Pine and Karl Urban were funny together. Just forget the name and go see Star Trek, i promise you that you will like it if you have ever liked Sci-fi movies."
"rshprd57","8","4","13","24 May 2009"," Great Movie, Just Not Quite Your Daddy's Star Trek
","I'm not a Trekker, but did follow and enjoy the series and movies.<br/><br/>I walked away from this movie with good, but also mixed opinion.<br/><br/>However, there are some aspects that were spectacular.<br/><br/>Hands down, the award for best portrayal of an existing Star Trek character has to go to Karl Urban. Karl completely and convincingly nailed the part of Lenard McCoy. Deforest Kelly would have been proud!<br/><br/>Next in that category goes to Simon Pegg for his portrayal of Montgomery Scott. Admittedly, some of that credit is due to the development of the original character throughout the Star Trek movies, which allowed one to see Simon's portrayal as how Mr. Scott might have started out. Nevertheless, Simon definitely had the part down.<br/><br/>Zoe Saldana as Uhura was convincing enough as well, again due to character development in the later Star Trek movies, which provided audiences with a deeper look into the original characters. There were however, some things about Uhura that many might be saying Wow!, Huh!!?<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto as young Spock was also convincing but perhaps a bit more (openly?) emotional than the Spock most of us have grown accustom to. However, you can absolutely accept this younger version of Spock.<br/><br/>John Cho as Sulu was also a good fit, but again was somewhat of an expanding on minor glimpses into the original character in the original series. It nevertheless worked in this film.<br/><br/>Lastly, Chris Pine as Kirk was initially hard for me at least to accept. However, by the end of the movie I could definitely see this character as how Shatner's Kirk might have started out.<br/><br/>Overall, the casting was excellent and well performed by all.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the movie was also extremely entertaining, but the high marks end there.<br/><br/>The Romulans, renegade or not, were just not very convincing Romulans. While the Romulans are suppose to less emotionally evolved ""cousins"" of the Vulcans, these guys were just a tad bit too emotional, if not undisciplined, for my taste. Yeah, we have seen emotional Romulans and Vulcans throughout the series and the movies, but I just did not get these guys. They seemed more human than Romulan.<br/><br/>Other than getting us all up to speed on the younger years of our favorite characters, the plot really does sort of go where no Trek has gone before. I had been forewarned that ""liberties"" had been taken with this movie and they definitely did that, which I am sure many of the hard core Trekkers will take issue with.<br/><br/>At the risk of spoiling the movie, lets just say that writers, producers, and director, definitely took liberties with this one by basically reinventing the entire future of the federation as we all came to know it beyond this period in time.<br/><br/>Great way to both cover their continuity behinds and perhaps even pave a road for a completely new Star Trek series and movies.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie if you enjoyed the original series and are NOT a hard core Trekker."
"tkaczyk-m","10","4","13","21 May 2009"," To all Trekkers and Trekkies
","I've decided to delete my previous comment and raise the note because of the comments I've seen.<br/><br/>To be honest - I don't understand you all. The original ST series is dead. Point. It was, in my humble opinion, revived in a respectful matter by TNG and there I stopped. Therefore my opinion is based just on some original movies,TNG, a few eps of Voyager, some games and nothing more. I don't mind being an ignorant in the eyes of some fans.<br/><br/>To the point. Let's make an example of Fallout 3. I enjoyed the game, but was fully aware of the fact, that after many years it was impossible to suit all fans and not keep up to date with modern game technology.<br/><br/>The same goes with Star Trek. I think that it's formula is worth presenting to the younger generation, because it's a great universe with lots of genuine characters and plots. What would you really expect? A copy of the old series? Or an updated version?<br/><br/>Oh yes, Volcan was destroyed. So what? Keep the old storyline in memory and enjoy the new one, where Spock is a more complex character at the beginning.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing a new series of many movies with this cast, developing new courses of action rather than seeing old story being retold. If the second option was chosen, you would be all despised by the fact of barging into a territory of ST cult. Instead, the team decided to make something new from something old.<br/><br/>Is it bad? Your choice.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the new movie. Really. Because the casting was done superbly and opens lots of possibilities for the future. Rather than nagging about inconsistencies or legend abridgerations I'd prefer to call it, as many are, an alternative (though following the same path) version with lots of cinematic improvements.<br/><br/>And having seen the new Kirk and Spock, completed by the XXI visual effects, I'm thinking fondly of the future productions. <br/><br/>I recommend you do the same and while in love with the classic productions, try to enjoy the fresh view."
"JasonKellerman22","10","4","13","17 May 2009"," Something new for everyone, you included!
","Being a ""non-trekker"" (as you like to label) I definitely do not have any say over the original star trek nor do I intend to try, seeing as how evidently you claim to have all the rights here! This movie was a prequel meaning that it shows what happened before the events that took place on the original show that you have adored for so many years. That being the case everyone,trekker or not, is starting from scratch and is on the same page.<br/><br/>It seems to me that your synopsis of this amazing film is nothing more than 33 years of repressed anger for being ridiculed for having an unhealthy state of obsession for a freaking show! I think that you are so blinded by the fact that you and people like you have been cultivated on being different for so long that you cannot consider anything new and therefore cannot enjoy a great movie. The whole idea of the film, in my opinion, was to give all of us ""non-trekkers"" a better appreciation and understanding as to why you were so in to the original show; and I can tell you that they nailed it!<br/><br/>I would like to point out that the way they presented Leonard Nimoy's cameo appearance in to the film was genius! Friends of mine who have a better understanding of the show said the casting for the movie was done beautifully. Maybe there were some alterations in characters namely the character of Spock but again the idea that the movie is a prequel sums everything up and I think nothing was overdone! Besides, the way the characters played off of each other was excellent! Personally I think William Shatner is a bigot and was seriously mistaken when he opted out from having a cameo. And as for Leonard Nimoy, have some respect for someone you have idolized for all these years! In my opinion the man is a rock star and that is exactly how you so called trekkers treated him in his glory days! Even you have to admit, in spite of what you think, that you were slightly excited to see the original Spock appear in that ice cave. I'm pretty sure that deep down you know it was cool when you witnessed the symbolic scene of the original Spock respectfully ""passing the torch"" to the new Spock.<br/><br/>I think it is a shame that you disgruntled trekkers could not appreciate a glorified and refreshing insight on your show that finally came! JJ Abram thought you guys had been in that hole of social deprecation long enough; but in his attempt to pull you out of the gutter you still manage to be considered weird. So congratulations, your lack of understanding outside of your non-social bubble is still intact. You can enjoy your old re-runs while I along with the rest of the enlightened will gratefully enjoy the new and improved for years to come!"
"Hemo_jr","10","4","13","15 May 2009"," This is simply the best SF movie ever made
","Watching _Star Trek_ this weekend was an amazing experience. It is not only extremely well written, acted and had amazing effects, but it tugged at emotional chords so long forgotten, I did not realize they were there. <br/><br/>I was 13 and an avid SF fan in the Fall of 1966 when I first saw the television version of ""Star Trek"" -- and as anyone connected with SF will tell you, 13 is the golden age of Science Fiction. ""Star Trek"" was actually good, its universe was well thought out and it attracted not just good TV writers, but good SF writers. When ""Star Trek"" looked like it might be canceled after the second season, I joined in the letter writing campaign to NBC to get it renewed for a third season. And when the third season was such a disappointment, I gathered up my feelings, put them in a box and buried them.<br/><br/>Watching _Star Trek_ 2009, that box of feelings burst out that box. This was not merely ""Star Trek"" revisited, or a new and improved ""Star Trek"", but ""Star Trek"" perfected. It was ""Star Trek"" with all the lightning captured in the bottle. I was proud, I was happy, I feel shivers and goosebumps multiple times, I was in awe of what was on the screen. Seeing Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu et al. in such heroic circumstances being more heroic than ever before was amazing. And the Enterprise, itself, coming out of warp drive with phasers blazing and photon torpedoes shooting to save the day was an emotional catharsis. I had to deliberately calm myself on several occasions.<br/><br/>_Star Trek_ is a good movie even disregarding the emotional strings it plucked for me. If anyone actually came to this movie cold (born in a box and never let out 'til now?) they would come away from it with the sense they had seen great entertainment. The story, the characters, the visual and emotional impact of the movie all came together here.<br/><br/>Now for a few minor nits that could have been picked by paying attention to science adviser on the movie. Eta Carinae is the perfect candidate for a supernova, it could have been mentioned by name. A planet in another solar system may have had its surface sterilized and its atmosphere blown away, but it is doubtful it would disintegrate completely. The sequence and timing of a supernova and its effects could have been mapped out a bit better. A class M planet so near Vulcan so as to see it as a fairly large disk in the sky would make it and Vulcan a double planet. But overall the movie paid more attention to science here than I am used to (kudos for that, as well). Also, the Bones character was heard in situations a ship's doctor would not normally he heard -- apparently just to let him say some of his more annoying catch phrases from the original TV series.<br/><br/>On Memorial Day weekend in 1977, _Star Wars_ was released. It made previous all science fiction films look pale and sickly in comparison. This Mother's Day weekend 2009 history repeats itself with the movie _Star Trek_. This _Star Trek_ movie stands head and shoulders above all SF movies before it. It is simply the best SF movie ever made."
"cecodere","5","4","13","13 May 2009"," Reset!
","Let us be a little bit more serious on this movie. It is actually a big reset button for the entire Star Trek franchise, and a disappointing one at that. Can you imagine an entire planet being destroyed without any defense systems trying to destroy the enemy ship, that is what happened for both for Vulcan and Earth, pretty far-fetched. <br/><br/>I know Star Trek can be far fetched, but I think this Star Trek movie is one of the worst in this department. Yes, the special effects are nice, the crew is interesting and acting is good, but the story is flimsy, and forgot all the previous Star Trek movies and shows you watched they are now worthless and no longer exist in this movie's reality, because history has changed!!"
"axy0","10","4","13","13 May 2009"," I want a show with this cast and Orci and Kurtzman as writers
","I was a fan of the Patrick Stewart era movies, and I came in to the theater highly skeptical. I was anticipating a formulaic action movie plot with mediocre acting by an inexperienced, young cast that probably only got the part because they looked like the original actors and could bring in some revenue from the young teenage girl demographic - Hannah Jonas 3-D status. I wasn't expecting much in terms of acting or plot. <br/><br/>Happy to say I was utterly and completely wrong (for the first time ever). The acting was on par with an episode of TNG. The plot was so much more than ""we have to stop the bad guy before he destroys Earth! Oh no, we almost messed up, but wait we saved it at the last minute!"" The twists made it so much more and tied it in with the original series nicely. Leonard Nimoy made up for the lack of a Patrick Stewart in this rendition as well. <br/><br/>The plot was very original and gave me something to think about on the walk to the car. That's when you know a movie is good. They stuck with the ""Back to the Future"" Theory of time travel which in my opinion is the only one that makes any sense.<br/><br/>The writers put some serious thought into this one. I am definitely going to check out their future projects. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>The two Spocks have different memories, so are they in a sense completely different people? The writers even got general relativity correct in the plot line which is almost unheard of in any sci-fi movie. Since Spock and Cpt. Nemoy were at different space points before entering the black hole, they should have different time dilation. In their case it was a 25 year difference - you could even work out the mass of the black hole with that information - I am very impressed by the writers here. Red matter is a term I don't believe exists in any previous sci-fi works (correct me if I'm wrong) which makes it a unique concept to this movie. Completely fictional, but still really cool. We will probably see it used again in many other sci-fi movies to come. <br/><br/>***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>That's what really set this new Star Trek apart from any of the previous movies in the franchise. It had new ideas, a new way of storytelling, and actors that pulled it off with a decent performance. <br/><br/>I admit, maybe I am giving it 10 stars instead of 8 stars because I had mediocre expectations for it. I also saw it on Thursday before the good reviews came out. I wasn't expecting it to be really good or really bad, so in a way my 10 star rating is unbiased in either direction. Any work that can successfully reinvent the legacy that is the original Star Trek (We have a space shuttle named after the Enterprise) deserves a 10 out of 10."
"cmwood","10","4","13","12 May 2009"," Because it's Mine, Abrams walked the line
","If you are a long time Star Trek fan (let's try 1967 as I watched it with my family as a youngster) I'm sure you had trepidations about the new film as I did. But fear not! for I bring you great tidings of glad joy. For the JJ, whose Alias is Abrams, has brought the Fringe to the Lost! As a died in the wool ""Trekkie"" (yes TREKKIE, not a hubristic Trekk-er which bears the weight of canon around their necks –not that there's anything wrong with that!) I've found myself more Trekker, who was lost and mired in the semantics, plot devices, and personalities of Star Trek canon.<br/><br/>So naturally when JJ Abrams did a preamble to a new trek preview that included an intonation like (paraphrased here);""I'm not really a Star Trek fan, I'm a Star Wars Fan!"" I notably raised my pointy eyebrows and twitched and my rounded ears with a resounding NO! He isn't going to ""Battlestar Galactica"" Trek is he? Huh??! you might ask? Well I actually am a fan of the TOTALLY different Galactica series that only bared resemblance to the original, in near design and name.<br/><br/>OH NO!, Not TREK! Please don't do that to MY Trek! (yes!, we rabid fans are possessive, and love to take ownership of something that belongs to everyone else too) However like Johnny Cash, the ""Bad Robots"" Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman walked the line with all Canon(s) firing! The thing about canons is, once they've fired, the cannonball is gone, and so it is with the canon of the new Trek.<br/><br/>Or put another way, how do you jettison the weight of the future, when it hasn't been written yet? <br/><br/>** Note this might be a spoiler for some**<br/><br/>The answer is simple, the long held Trek tradition of TIMELINES! The tradition has always been, we must restore the Original timeline! But what if you didn't? You would get the opportunity to (as has been euphemistically constantly referred to as..) reboot, the series. (Oh I get it, Bad Robots reboot everything!) The Goal, of course, is to grow NEW trek fans, something that has been waning for years.<br/><br/>As a teacher I took the opportunity to talk to students whom I know would otherwise dislike anything Trek to see if it worked.<br/><br/>I like this quote from one of my students, it truly sums up the sentiments of most that I spoke with, He said; ""I thought it was going to be lame, but it wasn't it was really good!"" And in case you haven't figured it out, an old dyed-in-the-wool Trekkie liked it too.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I could complain about the fact that in effort to make the ship look my gritty they made the engineering section look like ""suds your duds"" but I won't (oh I guess I just did! Well pour a little trekker in me!) But the pluses of Star Trek SO outweigh the minuses that I am anxiously awaiting the sequel.<br/><br/>You see Star Treks mission is, and always has been, to take us ""Where no man has gone before""! <br/><br/>Mission Accomplished JJ!"

","I've been waiting for this movie for some time now, and i was very excited to go see it, but unfortunately i was disappointed. It's a very good action movie, that keeps you plugged in for about 2 hours, with all sorts o explosions and visual effects. But that's about it. That's not what Star Trek is all about. That's not Gene Roddenberry's vision. In fact, this movie strikes a huge blow to everything Gene fought so hard to create over the years. Maybe i am saying this because i'm a huge star trek fan, but this movie is made for everyone, it's easily digestible, you don't have to think too much. It's doesn't leave you with anything to reflect upon. The entire story is pretty thin (seems to be written by someone who doesn't know too much about the Star Trek universe), and cannot be integrated into any other series. It has huge errors like Spock's mom dies, Vulcan is completely destroyed (WTF??), romulans appear at the middle of the first season of the original series, therefore they have no place in this time frame. Cardassians are mentioned (they appear about 200 years from now). What the hell is Scotty (an engineering genius) doing in a God forsaken place with a furry gremlin as an assistant (or pet)? And Sulu is NOT a ninja. Maybe the biggest error is Spock's interest in Uhura. Again WTF??? Didn't the scriptwriter see at least one episode of the original series??? Vulcans only mate once every 7 years!! Season 2 Ep 1 Amok Time! Hellooo. Mr. Abrams!!! I'm sorry, it has to be a Blockbuster movie, so somebody has to kiss or have sex with somebody, so people pay up to see vulcans making out. Pathetic. Gene is turning and twisting in his grave. Looks to me that they used the brand Star Trek to make people come to the cinema, pay up, and put an end to the recession, because this seems to be the only reason they made it. Too bad for the actors, who are pretty good, especially McCoy. i hope they won't make another one, because it would be a shame. Would be best to get Rick Berman, Branon Braga & CO to continue Enterprise instead, or do anything but this. My guess is that true Trekkies will be very disappointed. To JJ: Stick to anything else, but please don't mock Star Trek anymore than you already have. You should be ashamed."

","When I was a very young girl, I watched the original Star Trek series. Since then, I have seen every episode and every film of Star Trek. I thought it was impossible to make a movie about Kirk, Spock, Bones and Scotty with a new crew, but JJ Abrams made something fantastic of it. I think this new crew has watched the old one very precise, when you close your eyes you almost see the old crew in front of you, especially Bones and Scotty. It is also a great movie for young people. A lot of spectacular special effects and a lot of humor! It is a very sensational movie with a great story. This is a great movie for all ages, even for the 'die hard' Star Trek fans."

","I have watched, read, and listened to Science Fiction, quite literally, my entire life. While it's not my only interest (by a long chalk), SF is my favorite genre.<br/><br/>I watched the first run of Star Trek as a teen in the 60's. I loved it and tolerated the dismissal of the series by peers and parents as ""that Buck Rogers junk"". Now, Star Trek; the Original Series (ST:TOS), is held up as iconic Science Fiction, not to be challenged or changed.<br/><br/>Star Trek 11 not only challenges and changes the fundamental premises of ST:TOS, but does so brilliantly with humor, excitement, and yes, romance. Additionally, there are more than a few unforeseeable twists and turns.<br/><br/>All of the main actors give their characters wonderfully full, believable, and well-rounded existence. Their iconic relationships are developed logically and with sensitivity to the fannish sensibilities.<br/><br/>There ARE changes. Major changes. But most are reasonably explained in the course of the film. Those changes that do not have explicit explanation, can be rationally inferred from the context surrounding them.<br/><br/>The Battlestar Galactica series was successfully, and brilliantly rebooted. Star Trek 11 is doing the same for the Star Trek franchise. May it live long and prosper."

","MMMM This movie was delicious. As someone who grew up with Star Trek from the original to 'everything but Enterprise' (and I must admit to seeing a few of those as well) I am shocked at people who decry the 'canon'. Seriously? Get OVER yourselves. This movie pays appropriate homage to us true longtime devoted fans while at the same time, it embraces an entirely new set of fans for the real 'next generation'. After Shatner's Kirk and Stewart's Picard I never loved another captain... until tonight. When I saw a Captain truly worthy of the name (don't even get me started on the unworthiness of Janeway) Granted this *is* Kirk, but it also isn't. Yes, there is time travel, yes there is a rewriting of the history, but if you have *ever* read comic books, welcome to the genre! This does NOT discount all things Trek. It does not dismiss what we know and love about the story, the ideals and the 'big dreams' that star trek gave us in the 60s. Men and women, blacks, Russians, whites all working together. Earth peaceful and stable... Star Trek is more than a TV show, it is an ideal... And this movie? Captures that spirit and accomplishes its mission.<br/><br/>I left the theater upset that I'll have to wait at least a year or two for the next Trek movie! THANK you J.J. Abrams. You've earned my respect and gratitude."
"peter_uk","10","4","13","10 May 2009"," Unbelievably Brilliant!
","Clearly this new Star Trek is not for the purists, those that feel that absolutely nothing should ever change from the original series, and nothing should ever diverge from the ongoing ideals, steadfast beliefs and unswerving viewpoints of Trekkie and Trekker traditionalism. However, I can certainly say that am blown away by this latest offering and thoroughly enjoyed every action packed, pulse raging, sci-fi second of it.<br/><br/>And before I find myself shot down by the Star Trek fraternity for not towing the devout Gene Roddenberry line, I should mention that I was indoctrinated into Star Trek back in 1972 when I was four years old. I waited on tender hooks in the 1980's for the release of Star Trek the Next Generation, watched every episode of Star Trek Voyager during the 1990's with avid interest. I engrossed myself in Star Trek Enterprise with joy, and even tried to keep up with Star Trek Deep Space Nine. I own every Star Trek motion picture and consider myself to be a real fan, not a Trekkie or even a Trekker, but someone who simply enjoys Star Trek because it was good.<br/><br/>Yes this new motion picture is a tangent away from the original Star Trek series. Yes it does deviate from the established character doctrines and the classic good verses evil and we all live happily ever after outcome, but why the hell not? Lest it missed anyone's attention the last motion picture, Star Trek Nemesis, did not fair quite so well at the box office, and Star trek Enterprise was brought to a close after only four seasons. Why, because Star Trek has become predictable, unsurprising, and dare I say it, humdrum, but not for much longer it would seem.<br/><br/>Yes I found myself laughing and chuckling throughout the movie, and yes I was swept away by each panoramic shot of a new Enterprise, so adeptly replicated for the twenty-first century audience that it defies any kind of criticism from the Trekkie/Trekker perfectionists. I found every character, from Spock (Zachary Quinto), through to the dumb burly security officer was eminently portrayed, with exceptional performances by Simon Pegg (Scotty) and Karl Urban (Bones). Even Leonard Nimoy clearly enjoyed his part in this mind-blowing feast of special effects, stunningly crafted sets, and fast paced cinematography. Even the hand phasers that have been perfectly redesigned, combining the old with the new offer a science fiction geek like myself the chance of seeing a Star Trek as it should have always been, not the cardboard and balsa-wood archetypes of the 1960's that are woefully outdated.<br/><br/>Chris Pine was simply outstanding in his role as the young captain Kirk, a character so historically entrenched in the minds of all Star Trek fans it seems impossible to imagine anyone else but William Shatner playing that part. Yet within minutes of his appearance I was not only able to accept this youthful usurper, but found it difficult to separate the idea that Chris Pine was not indeed William Shatner himself, somehow magically rejuvenated just for this movie. Again, Zoe Saldana who played Nyota Uhura was tremendous, still sporting that bizarre earpiece that has always denoted Uhura's position as communications officer, and just as stunning as Nichelle Nichols in the original series. Admittedly the relationship between Nyota Uhura and another well known bridge office was something of a difficult twist to accept, but it still brought something special to the new Star Trek.<br/><br/>Congratulations J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman you have done the impossible and done it well. I and all of my friends are once again in awe of Star Trek and biting our fingernails in anticipation of the next Star Trek blockbuster movie. Don't disappoint us."

","I'm 55 and grew up with this as a TV show. In later years I went to the franchise movies and enjoyed them. This film, however, is a cut above the rest because of its casting and story line. Well-edited and directed, the story has moments that are deeply affecting. (When one remembers that this is a fantasy film prequel that is no mean achievement!) My 86 year old mother was with me, and behind us were some teenage boys--a pretty broad demographic--and we all clapped at the end. From a casting point of view, the young Kirk was as charming and virile as ever, an uncanny-looking Spock was well, perfectly Spock, and McCoy and Scottie were terrific. And, without giving it away, who knew about Uhura? This movie delivers on all fronts and the cast and crew should be proud of their efforts. A very enjoyable film."
"youngman44","10","4","13","9 May 2009"," Loyal Yet Updated
","I've been watching Star Trek since I was a young boy back in the early days (late 60's) and I loved everything about this movie. The characters were exceptionally true to form and the updated action as well as some much needed additional personality (to Ohuru in particular) was exceptionally well-suited but not overdone. The narrative itself was entertaining, suspenseful and intriguing. Exceptionally well written, in my view. Let's hope the collaborators can come up with another one like this. I feel confident it will be a massive hit. <br/><br/>I'd probably give this movie about a 9.6 out of 10. The one thing that was slightly disappointing was the voice of the young Spock. He just was far too boyish. He did a fine job with the part - but I think they could have scored an actor with a bit more richness, even though still youthful. I had a deeper voice at age 13 than this guy. I think that adds to the richness of Spock's character and logic - and that is central to the character. If that had been better, it would have been a 10 for me. <br/><br/>The beauty of this film is that it was extremely intense and exciting - I suspect it would be enjoyable for even new viewers who do not know the back story. <br/><br/>Yet, it threw plenty of 'bones' (literally and figuratively) to viewers in the characters of McCoy, Kirk, Spock, Sulu and the rest. Many classic phrases from the Doc, Kirk and Spock. <br/><br/>The added centrality of the role for Ohuru was more fitting for our culture as well as extremely entertaining. Zoe Saldana - whew! She is gorgeous. And, she was an excellent Ohuru."

You barely even need to know who Kirk is at all. (Of course it's hard to imagine being alive today and not having heard of him.) Knowledge of Trek Canon only enhances the experience of this movie. It is not necessary. I repeat, it is not necessary for you to know anything about Star Trek to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams and his production team have simply made a great action adventure movie that happens to be set in the Star Trek universe.<br/><br/>The effects are top notch, making you actually feel like they filmed these scenes in space, and the action is very engaging, but more importantly, the character moments give us wonderful glimpses into the people who will eventually form one of the most beloved crews of all time.

"sarastro7","10","4","13","8 May 2009"," Not bad, not bad...
","I was a bit skeptical, but I must admit this is a fine movie. We may even have a classic on our hands. The references to the original Trek are so sweeping that any Trekkie can't help but be thoroughly entertained. While the story is fairly weak and we don't really get into Nero's motivation, the production values are the best we've seen in a Star Trek movie yet. And the really big strength of this production is the characters. I'll just say it: They're all great! Good acting, good dialog, flawless character dynamics. Kirk, McCoy and Scotty are good, Uhura is superb and delectable, Chekov is funny and endearing, Sulu is utterly cool and Spock is simply spectacularly good! Get this crew into a TV series NOW! I'll pre-order the DVDs!<br/><br/>Still. This isn't *really* new. Paramount was not brave enough to do a continuation of the original Trek, but thought they had to regurgitate the old characters in order to succeed. Well, maybe - I guess we'll never know. But it's still a nostalgia trip more than it's innovative science fiction. Also, again, the story is weak. Exploding planets and supernovas. Yeah, yeah. They put that in there because they think that's the kind of thing you put into sci-fi movies. It's ""big""! But without a good story, it's not big at all. What the heck is ""red matter""? No explanation. Oh well. This is, I guess, par for the course. Most Trek movies, or sci-fi movies, don't have great stories. We'll survive.<br/><br/>But, apart from the story, I do have one serious gripe which, sadly, I've heard no one else even mention: Where's Roddenberry's Utopian society? We don't hear squat about it!! In the original series, Kirk's whole dynamic was about how poorly he fit into the Utopian society of his day, and how this drove him to be a space adventurer. If you want to, you can take this as being implicit in the new movie as well, but we don't hear a single detail about the nature of this future society, or the ideals of the Federation. It's as if Roddenberry's vision of a better future has been surgically, if not excised, then certainly ignored. As a utopianist myself, this bugs me. If we don't have the idealism of the background setting as part of this universe, then it's not a model for a better world, and then the characters are not all that heroic. This way, their actions matter a lot less. The big picture is not part of the picture. Well. Since the movie doesn't show anything, it still might be there. We'll have to see if it is included in the subsequent movies or TV series. I really hope so.<br/><br/>So. My rating of the new Star Trek is this: Subtract one star because it is a regurgitation of something old. And subtract another because the Utopian aspect is missing. Otherwise, very enjoyable movie. Good stuff.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"bsilverbush-2","9","4","13","8 May 2009"," Prequel to TOS, 21st Century Style
","Any movie fan knows that the key elements to a good movie are (not in order) story line, direction, cinematography, acting, and soundtrack. There are many good films that may be weak in one or two of these areas. However, a great movie excels in all of these areas. Star Trek 2009 is one such film. You most certainly do not need to be a ""Trekkie"" to enjoy the movie, for it stands on its own as terrific sci-fi. However, fans of Star Trek TOS (the original series) will be even more enamored of this near-perfect production, because the young characters (Kirk, Spock and cast) are true to their adult persona, as developed for television. At least, it's what we suspect these memorable characters would have been like in their youth. The inter-play, dialogue, and even the comic relief, is pure entertainment, and you will not find yourself looking at your watch at any point in the film. Casting is spot-on, as is the script. I have no doubt that this movie could not have been done any better, even if Gene Roddenberry had overseen production himself. I suggest, if you have the opportunity, that you see it in IMAX, because the computer generated graphics and sets are truly spectacular, such that the imagery nearly jumps off the screen and you actually find yourself on ""the final frontier."" FYI: Roddenberry developed his idea for Star Trek in 1964 when he thought of combining Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. The show was eventually canceled because of low ratings. However, the show's impact on pop culture cannot be denied."
"MrWall21","9","4","13","8 May 2009"," Just Watch It
","This was the easiest 9 out of 10 I've ever given. Star Trek is the Star Trek movie we've been waiting for, despite it's negation of almost all previous Trek (not a spoiler, by the way). Part of the reason I don't give it a 10 is because of that weird negation which leaves us with Enterprise as the only Trek relevant to this new series (I hope we get some sequels out of this!). The new timeline leaves us with the same characters who are somehow different. Everything is familiar but different enough that we don't know what to expect. So this movie feels very much like a reboot as well as a continuation, and a sequel as well as a prequel in a way only Star Trek can. You will feel uneasy about this a few times in the movie, when you realize that there is no reset button, and no way to cheat death. The Kobiashi Maru figures into the story, and you'll see why when you watch. By the way, without spoiling too much, Spock, Vulcan or not, copes with loss remarkably well. <br/><br/>Venturing into the unknown, coping with loss, and a fair amount of logic vs. humanity make this a more mature movie than perhaps the producers want you to think it is (the commercials seem to advertise it as purely an action flick). But watching it reminded me of the best parts of Star Trek II and VI, my favorite Trek films. In fact, as much action as there is here, it never seems to drag too long or seem incomprehensible as it does in most action movies. The focus is on the story and the characters. <br/><br/>And the characterizations are solid, if a bit different from what we expect. Sulu doesn't have his cocky optimism and machismo despite being respectably kick-ass. Cho seems to be channeling his masochist character from House rather than the reborn Harold from the end of Harold and Kumar. Uhura, still the most compassionate character, is withdrawn and a bit cold compared to Nichelle's warm and playful Uhura who sings and shakes her booty when off duty. Bones is spot-on, and Zachary Quinto, who already seems to have the name of a Vulcan, is also superb. Chris Pine has clearly done his homework here and channels Kirk far better than Jim Carrey ever did on In Living Color. There is one scene towards the very end of the movie, as he walks onto the bridge where Pine seems to have copied cell-for-cell a signature Shatner mannerism. I'll have to watch it again to be more specific. <br/><br/>One last note. Not terribly pertinent but something I have to get out. The Vulcan school where we see young Spock seemed just a bit too robotic and alien for a Vulcan institution. This is a culture of logic, yes, but also a culture of jeweled breastplates and Hebrew hand signals. Eh."

","I've been a TOS ""Trekkie"" for nearly all of my short life. Seen every movie, watched and re-watched every episode. I must admit, when I first heard that Star Trek was being revamped I was both excited and a little afraid. Would it be the same Trek I knew and loved so much already? Would it be better? Far worse? Was Star Trek ready for a revamp? Would Trekkies still like it, or would it be another flop that others could run us on a line with? My fears were completely unfounded.<br/><br/>The movie is, for lack of more accurate words, simply stunning. It was a definite thrill ride and was extremely entertaining from beginning to end. Really, it was what the original Star Trek had always wanted to be but couldn't. There's only so much you can do when all you have is some cardboard and Styrofoam rocks set in a different colored background every week for one hour.<br/><br/>The casting could not have been better, especially in the three major roles we were all looking forward to--Kirk, Spock, and Bones (the last of which could have been DeForest Kelley's son, he played him so well)--and Nimoy's appearance was, of course, the icing on the cake. Not only did nearly every beloved reference get immense approval from the Trekkie crowd, the few that didn't catch the references still found them fitting. In other words, everyone loved this film, even the kids in the crowd who'd probably never even heard of it.<br/><br/>As a Trekkie myself, I feel compelled to address my fellows reading this: though this is not the Trek of old, it hasn't lost a thing in the revamp. Those who complain that the message of love and equality was been pulled from it, thus making it worthless, are only looking for a flaw. This is a different era with a whole new set of problems. Complexity is still there, it just isn't in the fact that races and cultures can mix, or rallying for the rights of women. Whole new questions of morality and sense of identity are addressed, topics for this day and age, and the transfer is truly a seamless and, in my opinion, great direction for the franchise.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great film, whether you want to believe it or not. Give it a chance! If for nothing else, the plot has a refreshingly realistic ""Star Wars""-ish feel to it for those looking for the go-ahead to cross over, but fans, enemies, and clueless laymen alike will equally enjoy this amazing epic of a film.

Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine were both amazing as Spock and Kirk. I thought Pine did a really good job as Kirk but since I don't know what Shatner was like, I cant really comment if he was better. Now one good thing JJ Abrams has done is that he has put up a lot of comedy in the film, thus even though its supposed to be serious stuff going on the comedic edge keeps things fun. Simon Pegg as Scott was brilliant. This review wont be complete without mentioning the top notch CGI, the graphics were amazing, they made the whole affair a pleasant feast for the eyes.

"fisher2314","10","7","28","1 May 2009"," How can Chekov be there?
","Although the movie is not out yet, there is one point of contention in the casting/crew. Pavel Chekov did not appear until the second season of the original series as a ""green"" recruit. He was never a character in the first season. Right away that made his appearance here seem out of place. Indeed, according to the archives on www.startrek.com, Pavel Chekov graduated (graduates?) from the Academy in the year 2267. Jim Kirk graduated in 2254, a full 13 years earlier. If we assume that they graduated as college age students (early 20's or so), that would have made Chekov about 12 when Kirk graduated. Indeed, the same archive puts Kirk's birth year as 2233 so he was indeed 21 upon graduation and Chekov's birth year was listed as 2245 so he was 22 upon graduation. In the original series, Kirk was in his mid 30's as Captain so that would have made a new recruit Chekov in his early 20's so that works out. However, in the new movie, Kirk and Chekov appear to be working side by side right out of the Academy. I think Mr. Abrams made a goof by including Chekov in this original crew movie. This may sound over the top goofy but we are dealing with an old, well established franchise that has certain norms and constants that should be acknowledged. Putting Chekov in this movie appears to be an error. However, as I said, the movie has not even hit the screens yet so there could be some odd explanation (distant cousin, father, etc. Pavel Chekov is listed as an only child so it's not some kind of twin brother thing) but it will still strike the Trek faithful as odd."

"the_rb-1","7","3","9","21 May 2009"," Not worthy of the top 250
","This movie did a lot of things right and will probably win a lot of awards because of it. But I don't think it's worthy of the top 250 here at IMDb, not even close.<br/><br/>First off, the CGI and direction in general was great. A lot of people including myself were stunned by the gigantic explosions and sweeping shots of gargantuan space ships hurdling through space. The only problem I had with the directing was the liberal use of the shaky cam during action scenes... a pet peeve of mine.<br/><br/>I'll also briefly mention the acting was pretty good and I didn't really see any weak link in the cast. I especially found Spock's whole inner struggle very believable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, at about the halfway point of the movie, after getting accustomed to the unreal space battles I started paying attention to the story, and that's where it all went down-hill. The plot is riddled with many uses of the 'deus ex machina'. At the heart of every problem (and indeed, solution!) lies either a black hole, or far-fetched one-in-a-trillion coincidence. This would be even slightly bearable, if the writers had done any research on black holes whatsoever. Alas, scientific inaccuracies abound making poor physicists like me cringe in their seats.<br/><br/>OK, so maybe the scientific inaccuracies escape most people. But it doesn't matter. There are other glaring flaws in the movie. Once we know who the bad guys are and how to solve the problem (again, at about the halfway point of the movie), other things like smart dialog and character development get completely pushed aside to make room for neat explosions, unbearable one-liners and a corny motivational speech or two. In short, Star Trek goes from a fantastic movie to an average action flick.<br/><br/>So, to summarize, Star Trek did a lot of things right, but it wasn't without its mistakes too. I've focused more on the mistakes here because most people seem to think this is one of the best movies ever made, which I can not at all agree with."

","I'm a lifelong Trek fan in all of its incarnations. Loved the movie. Great story. Great laughs. Truly exciting and invigorating. Amazing fun ride. <br/><br/>Just one beef with the execution of the movie: Is it just me or was there some crazy unbridled CG lighting geek working on the movie that was totally in love with blinding lens flares, light sources, and reflections? Yes, CG dudes and dudettes, these lighting effects are beautiful, impressive, and bring realism to a largely CG movie. But at some point they just become ridiculous and distracting. The scenery is so complex, beautiful, and intriguing that I wanted to pay more attention to it, but I found it difficult with 2, 3, 4 or more glinting, flickering, flashing, or otherwise scene-obscuring lighting effects per shot causing me to squint or close my eyes or have my attention drawn out of the scene. Honestly, by the end of the movie I found myself rolling my eyes and chuckling every time the movie trotted out one more kitschy distracting lighting effect. Oh, there's the sun in my eyes again... Come on. Really?<br/><br/>OK, so, in the grand scheme of things, a very minor technical criticism. Annoying but not unforgivable. On the whole the movie is an amazing achievement and excellent start to a new Star Trek era. Live long and prosper...and wear your sunglasses kiddies!"
"C-Younkin","8","3","9","17 May 2009"," Best of summer so far
","JJ Abrams does what I never would have expected him to do, make a Star Trek that was accessible to everybody, even those who never really thought much of it (namely me for one). This is an eye-popping, heart-racing thriller of a movie with fantastic special effects, make-up, and exhilarating action sequences. It has a fantastic supporting cast including Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, and Eric Bana, being perfectly twisted as the main Romulan villain Nero. Leonard Nimoy also appears in a cameo that should have fans drooling. But what I loved were the two central performances coming from Chris Pine, as the cocky, restless, and wild James T. Kirk, and Zachary Quinto as Spock, torn between logic and emotion, Quinto finds the humanity. The power struggle between the two is one of the highlights of the movie. I can only hope that Abram's ""Star Trek"" will live long and prosper."
"fred-houpt","9","3","9","17 May 2009"," A fitting and exciting prequel. Well worth the price of admission
","At my age I can attest to having watched the first series, Shatner/Kirk and Nimoy/Spock, etc. I loved the first series and I grew up watching all the rest. Looking back at the original series now, seen in the current context of powerful computer CGI and mock-up modeling at a high level, the first series is almost painfully amateur to watch. Having said all that, it was the first and it dealt with its story, its special effects as a made for television show that the networks killed off just as it was capturing an audience. Now, in mid 2009 we see a terrific depiction as a prequel to the first series.<br/><br/>There are several really big problems for this film and I'll give them now. The first series had the most minimal computer graphics that the cameras showed. This prequel shows off computer chops that look to be about 100 years more advanced than they should. That was a choice the director took and although it makes no sense to those of us who knew what the original looked like, I suppose the alternative of showing an even more crude and undeveloped technology in this film would have looked, well, boring to the eyes of a current audience who use computers much more complicated than the original show; if you follow me....<br/><br/>Second, the twists in the plot (I won't spoil it) are so ridiculous and utterly impossible, that all one can do is say, well, this is a movie and it's all made up and fictional, so why not just throw rational thought out the window? The saving grace to this film is the depiction of the original cast as younger men and woman, who now all appear like gleaming, young, revved up hot rods, ready to kick some serious ass as they boldly go. You get the picture. The script is not the winner here nor are the predictable badder than bad bad guys. The real kick that this film has in spades is a relentless plot that does not rest for more than a minute or two at best. The blistering pace this film achieves just moves you along, never letting you think too long about what people just said or how preposterous the plot just got. It is just more go, go, go, and then more. That is what an action picture fantasy like this demands and the cast and director deliver. Don't bother trying to make sense of the plot; not even Spock's vaunted logic could deal with that. A really fun time at the movies and a very plausible, if over horse-powered, prequel crew. Terrific fun and a keeper once the DVD comes out. What a hoot."
"Kirasjeri","9","3","9","13 May 2009"," Great, BUT beware the PARADOXES of Time Travel and Alternate Realities!
","I've always had issues with time travel and the inherent paradoxes. Beyond that, alternate realities/alternate time lines is another issue for me, and there were very many of them in all the ST TV series.<br/><br/>One time in ""Yoyager"" it became so obvious a crewmen asked Captain Janeway about the paradoxes, and she replied quizzically, ""the best thing to do is just not think about them"". <br/><br/>Usually, broken time lines end up back to normal, but in this film nothing ends up as it was.<br/><br/>Remember the infamous episode of ""Dallas"" when an entire season of shows was wiped out as they were depicted merely as a dream? That is what this ""Star Trek""movie just did on a gigantic scale - wiped out EVERYTHING we saw and know and accept as a given as part of the ""canon"". No Federation-Klingon Alliance, perhaps no Borg, and on and on.<br/><br/>In the movie, in the future, Spock fails to reach Romulus in time to create a singularity to save that world from a supernova. How exactly that was Spock's fault I failed to discern.<br/><br/>But Nero's Romulan ship, a mining ship, went with Spock's vessel through a singularity (created too late), and somehow went back through time instead of being scattered to the subatomic level or turned into pure energy, or whatever happens in a Black Hole. Romulus was destroyed by the supernova.<br/><br/>Nero blamed Spock, and somehow every planet in the Federation. This is not logical, and if Nero is merely insane, well, that detracts from his validity as a villain. Khan was not insane, certainly not to that degree.<br/><br/>Nero manages to drill a hole into a defenseless Vulcan, insert some ""red matter"", that can create a singularity, and this all of Vulcan and six billion people are destroyed, while Spock watches! Off next to Earth, which was also equally defenseless, except for their relatively few star ships. The excuse for that was they were off elsewhere on another assignment.<br/><br/>Well, after some heroics, Nero and his ship get sucked into another singularity and they vanish. To reappear in the sequel, in the present, past or future?? Who knows.<br/><br/>So Vulcan is gone in the film. Romulus is still there as it got destroyed only in the future. Kirk, while still a cadet at the academy, get command of the Enterprise and, at the film's end, permanent promotion from the Federation from mere cadet to captain! Puhleeze.<br/><br/>Why can't Spock go back through another singularity and change the time line?? How one can determine where in the past or future you will end up in going through one of those I can not figure out.<br/><br/>So, there is no single reality. There is any number of time lines depending on who changes what in the past. as I said, I always had issues with this. And also as I said, even Spock made a reference at the end to ""cheating"". It does make it easier for the screenwriters to just blow up everything that happened in the Star Trek world and ""canon"".<br/><br/>Weirdest paradox, at the end. Young Spock meets old Spock, and they have a conversation!! Think about that. It should be impossible. <br/><br/>So, you can see the paradoxes. Right captain Janeway? What's that, captain? ""Just don't think about them""?? Isn't that ""cheating"", as Spock said? Guess so. As with so many shows, be it ""24"" or whatever, suspension of disbelief is required.<br/><br/>So turn off your scientific logic and just enjoy the fun. But remember, like Vulcan, everything you knew about the Star Trek universe is now gone - at least until someone goes back and corrects the time line! The movie is PG-13, and almost a PG. I would have preferred an R with some real gore.<br/><br/>Superb special effects, sound effects, score, set design, costumes, etc. Well acted, and many touches that are reminiscent of episodes, scenes or events from the original series. <br/><br/>The interior of the Enterprise looked nothing like that on the cheesy set of the first TV series, thankfully.<br/><br/>When did Romulans become giant super-powerful bald guys covered in what looked like Maori facial tattoos?? Or was that supposed to be only typical to that crew? Of course, the Federation first saw Romulans quite late, in ""The Balance of Terror"" episode.<br/><br/>Major Plot Hole: apparently both Vulcan and Earth were totally defenseless without so much as a phaser bank available. Even Star Fleet headquarters in California, a population center, had no defense, neither shields, nor phasers, and certainly not photon torpedoes. Nothing. That big ""drill"" in the film was easily knocked out with light hand-held weapons.<br/><br/>Minor Plot Hole: The Romulan vessel was not originally some all-powerful doomsday machine from another race; it was a working mining vessel. Even though from the not too distant future, it all too easily handled not only Federation but Klingon warships.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder played Spock's mother! Who dies. Ben Cross played his father Sarek, now that Mark Lenard is dead. And Leonard Nimoy played one of the Spocks. Speaking of Spock, a much thinner and less stacked version of Uhura makes out with Spock in the film. And when did they become an item??"

","Star Trek (the reboot) is one of the best 'summer blockbusters' i've seen in years. While most of these 'event' movies seem to disappoint, Star Trek is actually better than you can imagine! This is a really clever and well done reboot of the original series which should please Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike. Some nit-picking purists might moan about certain aspects but this is better than anyone could have hoped.<br/><br/>Starting with a blistering pre-credits sequence that is both exciting and moving, you just know your in for a treat! And the rest of the film is just as good, for director JJ Abrams has given us a fresh new take on the Trek universe. He has upped the action quota (and much of it is quite brutal) and the film moves at such a breakneck speed as to be a thrilling ride. Special effects are top notch, and there are some stunning shots that will have you itching to see the film again.<br/><br/>Thankfully the most important aspect, the cast, are just superb. Nice performances that hark back to the original characters but don't imitate them. Quinto is just uncanny as Spock and Chris Pine is just dynamite as the young arrogant but self assured Kirk. Some of their scenes with each other are just riveting. Also worthy of note is Karl Urban as McCoy and Simon Pegg as Scotty, although Pegg does get less screen time than the rest.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws in the film, one involving a massive coincidence thats hard to swallow, a silly alien that chases Kirk and an alien assistant for Scotty we could have done without. But these don't detract from what is a hugely entertaining and enjoyable entry into the Star Trek universe.<br/><br/>This viewer is already looking forward to seeing it again and hopefully we'll see some sequels. But if your planning to see it, then make sure you see it on the big screen for maximum effect!"
"jaddison383","9","3","9","11 May 2009"," Beyond the Final Frontier
","It's not clear from the opening moments of J.J. Abrams' Star Trek what we're in for. A dramatic, action-filled opening greets us on a huge scale of special effects, makeup design, elaborate sets, and emoting. From there the film zooms along, introducing us to the characters, jetting off on a thrilling plot, racing us through action, humor, and character in an incredible display of movie magic until we reach the finale and simple ending. Yet somewhere along the way something has changed. Somewhere along the way we've been completely taken in, and Star Trek has emerged as something of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>To give away any of the plot would be to take away from what is truly a fantastic experience. I am in no way someone familiar with the original series, and guess what: This movie still blew me away. The feeling of elation filling me as I left the movie theater is a feeling the likes of which has not been produced by a summer action movie in a long time. Director Abrams has taken one of the most popular series of all time and created something current and completely enjoyable for all audiences. What's incredible is that he was able to take a material so beloved and turn it into something far beyond anything you'd ever expect from a Star Trek movie. It truly goes beyond the 'final frontier', and into great movie territory.<br/><br/>The cast all fit the movie perfectly, providing humorous characters with just the right amount of humanity to make them completely relatable. The film takes us on a journey that is so out-of-this-earth (excuse the pun), we can't help but drink it up. The movie is paced at a great speed to keep us utterly enthralled and still allow for the appropriate amount of depth. But most importantly of all, the film reminds us what true, wonderful movie-making is all about in the first place: Entertainment. 8.5/10 stars!!!<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","With the recent surge in reboots of franchises and remakes, J.J. Abrams goes into a little different direction, and uses time travel as a device to play in both worlds, that being the original series and the new reboot he has created. The result is a highly entertaining film with great special effects and good performances.<br/><br/>Going through a black hole and destroying a federation ship, Nero has altered the current time line and created an alternate universe. He's exacting revenge on other planets because his was destroyed. Can the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise stop him in time? I never watched the original series with Shatner, and caught a few episodes of The Next Generation because my dad would watch them. The series seemed to be running out of gas in films, with every single film being about throwing the ships shield's up and pretending to be hit by missiles in space. I welcome this so called 're-boot' with open arms, the series needed it in my opinion. Abrams and co have created something special here and I'm interested in seeing where they take this series.<br/><br/>The casting choices work for me, I knew enough of the original characters to know this. For me, Urban as McCoy is the best casting decision. Quinto from Heroes fame fills the shoes of Spock, he looks the part and plays the part well. The guy looks evil every time you look at him. Pegg as Scotty is a given and newcomer Pine does the role justice and I'm glad he didn't try to impersonate Shatner here. Everyone works in their supporting roles and we are introduced to them by the numbers. I was a tad upset to only see Pegg introduced near the end of the film, but here's hoping we see more of him in future installments.<br/><br/>The special effects were stunning. I noticed they employed the same technique used in the short lived brilliant television show Firefly, which employed quick zooms and having objects and people out of focus for a brief second while in space. Although, I'm sure during the scenes in space, it would be silenced, such as the girl flying out of the ship in the opening and Kirk & Sulu descending on the drill. Yet in other scenes we would hear the explosions of the missiles and so on. Inconsistent, but not a huge problem.<br/><br/>The way the film is shot is beautiful, but I could do with a little less of the lens flare. I understand that it was intentional, but near the end of the film is became a little overbearing and distracting. Also Bana is underused in my opinion. I could have used a bit more with him and Kirk in the climax.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a bang and the adrenaline is there at the end as well. The film slows down in some parts, but this is needed to fill in the spots of the story. A story that is well written and with Abrams behind the camera, well directed. Abrams has finally made the jump from television to film. His first try was the mediocre Mission Impossible III. With Star Trek it seems this guy has no fear, taking on two films that belong in a franchise, kudos.<br/><br/>Trek is entertaining, funny and will draw in a new audience. I had a great time in the theatre and liked every minute of it. I can't wait to see the direction they take this new and exciting series. Thanks for not disappointing."

","I was hoping that Star Trek, a science fiction adventure film, would be just as amazing as its predecessors. I wanted a feeling of nostalgia, but did not want a copy and paste of the old movies. To my surprise, it not only met my expectations, but went so far beyond them. It gave us the characters we loved but set them in a parallel world letting them set their own new journey. They gave us a younger and fresher feeling while keeping it funny and suspenseful. Everything about this new Star Trek, from the amazing directing from JJ Abrams, to the outstanding cinematography and visual effects, makes me give this movie a 10 out of 10. A rating only fit for a minuscule amount of movies. Just like all the original Star trek movies began, the new Star Trek ended the same way, with the most famous quote said by the original Spock, ""Space the Final Frontier: These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""(Star Trek 2009)"

","JJ Abrams and his creative team with added lens flare have rebooted the Star Trek films and gone off to another timeline.<br/><br/>This preserves the stories of the earlier Star Trek adventures and its sequel shows but allows Abrams to concentrate on new stories a younger crew of the Enterprise. That was the plan with Star Trek. Unfortunately it all went awry immediately with the sequels.<br/><br/>However here we see the adventures of the younger James T Kirk, a rather wayward young man encountering Spock, Sulu, Scott and Bones as well as other crew members.<br/><br/>The writers have created conflict between Kirk and Spock as the Vulcan is unhappy with Kirk's breach of ethics and later after Spock's planet his destroyed, Kirk's inability to follow orders as Spock kicks him off the Enterprise which leads Kirk to meet the older, alternative Spock.<br/><br/>The plot is a renegade Romulan attacking Federation ships, who might be from another time and his anger is focussed on Spock. It is an action oriented film, with fun and humour.<br/><br/>The best acting performance is from Karl Urban who just oozes the spirit of Doctor McCoy, very few thought that Urban had it in him to deliver such a marvellous performance."
"filipemanuelneto","7","2","5","20 April 2017"," A new life and a new story for the Enterprise.
","The film franchise ""Star Trek"" began in the seventies at the expense of the enormous popularity of a TV series. Films have succeeded and, if we think about it, we can consider two cycles of films (the Kirk cycle and the Picard cycle) but, no matter how much they change, they have always tried to maintain that inspirational connection with the source, the TV series. This movie is finally breaking with that. The series is no longer in the memory of the overwhelming majority of the audience and only the staunchest fans will challenge what this movie did: write a new story for ""Star Trek"", as if we could spend an eraser on everything that has been said and done so far and recreate everything from the scratch. Well, I usually take these exercises with caution but, I confess, I enjoyed the final product. I'm not from the generation that saw the series, so it doesn't shock me seeing the characters being reinvented with a brand new story. It can even be refreshing for new audiences.<br/><br/>Despite previous films, this film bets heavily on special effects and CGI. This made it visually terrific, even when these CGI seems quite unrealistic (the effect created when ""Enterprise"" reaches warp seems more and more like a submarine navigating fast forward). The actors did a very positive job and the least positive point was the romance between Spock and Uhura, with Kirk trying to make a triangle with them. This always seemed strange in the plot, even considering Kirk's womanizing, irresponsible and stubborn behavior. I enjoyed revisiting Leonard Nimoy in the character that earned him fame and success. The soundtrack is, by far, more interesting than the previous films, blending themes from the movies and the series into a unique and unmistakable soundtrack, that is in the ear."

","(www.plasticpals.com) I was never a huge fan of the original TV series from which this remake takes its inspiration. I'm more of a Next Generation kind of guy, which I watched religiously every weeknight during junior high. In my view the original series survives mostly on camp and the rare, well-written episodes that made a statement of sorts. But there's no denying that the crew of the original Enterprise have become ingrained in the pop-cultural subconscious due to their archetypal characterizations. So the remake probably shouldn't have come as much of a surprise to me, though it did catch me off guard as a fan of The Next Generation, whose cast members are all alive and well, and fully capable of doing a new movie in that series.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams made it abundantly clear in his press interviews leading up to its release that Star Trek wasn't trying to appeal to the hardcore trekkers. You know the ones: the kind you see dressed as Klingons at comic conventions that get humiliated mercilessly by Triumph the insult-comic dog, and parodied on The Simpsons. No, he insisted, this Star Trek was made for the every man, the casual moviegoer looking for an entertaining sci-fi flick. And I think he succeeded.<br/><br/>So bravo, J.J., for rebooting a series the right way unlike, say, the wholly abominable Terminator 3 (of which I will never speak again) or the X-files sequel. There's very little I would change about Star Trek, except for the obnoxiously way over the top chase sequence starring a young, rebellious Jimmy Kirk, the curiously bare-naked alien (living in extreme arctic conditions) or the silly and totally predictable final challenge to the Enterprise. And there's no robots. But these are minor quibbles, really. Hell, I was so absorbed that I didn't even recognize Eric Bana (playing the principal villain). Oh, and lest I forget, Uhura has never looked so good.<br/><br/>Despite playing with the series canon, I don't think too many fans will reject the changes given Leonard Nimoy's unabashed ""passing of the torch"".<br/><br/>So definitely check it out."

"MBunge","6","2","5","26 September 2010"," Fun and energetic, but let's be honest. It's not much of a Star Trek movie.
","This movie is big, loud, exciting, fresher and more energetic than anything from Star Trek in well over a decade. That doesn't mean it's any good, though.<br/><br/>I could try and go into the plot, which involves time travel, an alternate time line and an assload of black holes, but let's be honest. This movie should really be titled Star Trek Muppet Babies. It's the original crew back when they were roughly the same age as the cast of Gossip Girl. There's really not much else to the story, aside from the best special effects in the history of the franchise. The plot isn't more than an excuse for the characters to rush around, get into fights and make funny quips. As a summer movie thrill ride, it's pretty good. In fact, it's better at that than the first big movie of summer 2009 (which now apparently starts in May), X-Men Origins: Wolverine. So, if you're nostalgic or just looking to turn your brain off for a couple of hoursyou'll probably enjoy this film<br/><br/>However, Star Trek has a great many flaws. To start with, this is probably the most scientifically ignorant story to ever come out of the Star Trek franchise. The original series was much smarter about science than this thing. Next Gen, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and all of the other Star Trek films are smarter than this. Yes, even Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier doesn't disregard basic scientific fact and theory as blatantly as this movie does. Now, that may not matter to you. For me, when a film deals a lot with black holes and it's obvious that the screenwriters never even Googled the term ""black hole"" to know what they were writing about, it's aggravating.<br/><br/>This movie also has probably the single least interesting villain in the history of Star Trek on the big screen. The Klingons from The Search for Spock were better than Captain Nero (Eric Bana). Heck, even the stretchy-faced guys from Insurrection were more compelling. It's not Bana's fault. He can certainly act and he emotes as much as he can, but there's just nothing to his character.<br/><br/>I also have to make the same complaint about Star Trek that I make about many contemporary action movies. The fight scenes are frequently indecipherable. It's like someone took the footage and edited it together by throwing it in a blender and pushing ""puree"". Everything happens so quickly and the camera is so close in on the action that I can only get a vague impression of who's shooting who or who's punching who in the face. Maybe I'm just getting old and the kids today with their iPhones and their Facebooks and their Twitter can follow this stuff. I mostly can't.<br/><br/>This is also a pretty weird looking film, if you pay attention to it. For example, some of the areas inside the Enterprise look like the 23rd century while others look like a brewery or the floor of a factory. I mean, there's almost always some creative license when it comes to the interior of a space ship in the movies, but the insides of this Enterprise don't make a lick of sense.<br/><br/>As for the Star Trek Muppet Babies experience? Jeffrey Quinto and Anton Yelchin are passable versions of Spock and Chekov. John Cho's a fairly generic Sulu. Zoe Saldana is extremely hot and gets more to say as Uhura than the character usually has. Simon Pegg seems to play Scotty as a funny slacker. Chris Pine is charismatic as Jim Kirk but there's really not much Kirk-like about his character. I realize you probably don't want to watch a 20something actor do a William Shatner impersonation for two hours, but this Jim Kirk could have been a character from any of a hundred outer space movies. In fact, Karl Urban gives the hands down best performance as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and that's largely by doing a DeForest Kelly impersonation.<br/><br/>Star Trek is an entertaining film. I don't want to take that away from it. But the acid test for any Star Trek story isdoes the underlying story stand up if you remove any Trek connection from it? This movie fails that test. It's nowhere near the level of The Wrath of Khan or The Voyage Home. Its enthusiasm and the new look and feel it brings to Trek, however, definitely raises it above crap like Nemesis or Generations.<br/><br/>While adventure has always been a big part of any good Star Trek, it's always been about more than just shooting people with phasers or beaming people out of ships seconds before they crash. At its best, Star Trek has always grappled with issues of the human condition. This movie doesn't do that. But if it can breathe new life into a franchise that was driven into the ground through incompetence and a tragic lack of imagination, that's quite an achievement in its own right."

","Speaking as someone who has never seen the original Star Trek films or watched any of the TV shows, I wasn't very excited when I heard about this film because I didn't know anything about the Star Trek universe. However, when I saw the trailer, I was very interested in checking the film out and I'm glad I did. I've heard that this film was geared towards people like me, the younger generation. People who had never been introduced to Star Trek. I was very thrilled by this film and it definitely left me wanting to see more. The cast was very good, the story was well done and the whole feel of the film was just epic. In so many ways, it was my kind of film, which is so ironic to me because I've always viewed Star Trek as ""not my thing"". After seeing this film, I don't think I want to go and see the older Star Trek films. Not because I think they'd be bad compared to this one, but because I feel like the new Star Trek is more my thing and I want to embrace that. Maybe someday I'll check out the older films, but right now I'm just looking forward to another Star Trek film in this new series. I will definitely go out and buy this film and I would recommend to anyone who loves sci-fi or action films. Even if you've never seen any version of Star Trek, this film is a blast."
"John_Truby","Null","2","5","8 January 2010"," Takes this tremendous challenge head-on
","Renewing an old series is one of the most difficult challenges for a screenwriter. The audience is familiar with all of the previous stories and the series' complete iconography. So the bar is very high. Plus, the reason you are renewing series is because the mythology has been told to death. So coming up with a new story that both pleases and surprises the die-hards is extremely difficult.<br/><br/>Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman chose to go with an origin story, which seems so obvious I wondered why the Star Trek powers hadn't done this a long time ago. Oftentimes the origin of a superhero or superhero team is the most fun part, not only because we get to see how this special magic first came into being but also because the story is, literally, original. Every other story after the origin is essentially the same tale but with a different opponent.<br/><br/>But origin stories are also a lot more difficult than they appear, as the writers of Watchmen discovered. Audiences love seeing the formation of the original team, but if you take too long doing it you kill narrative drive. And once you kill it it's real hard to get it back.<br/><br/>Star Trek's writers solved the problem of renewing this ancient (by Hollywood's standards) series, and executing a good origin story, by grabbing some of the best techniques of science fiction, myth and drama. Science fiction often piggy-backs on the myth form. That's why so many science fiction stories use Greek and Roman names, stories and history. Myth is the best genre for telling a story that covers a great deal of space and time, and science fiction is the futuristic form that typically covers huge amounts of space and time.<br/><br/>Like all genres, myth has certain unique story beats that must be present if you want to execute the genre properly. For example, many myth stories begin with the birth of the hero, followed immediately by the death of the father. Sure enough that beat happens in the opening scene of Star Trek. And its followed by every other major beat in the myth form.<br/><br/>The writers keep the story from being a predictable myth-repeat by adding some of the key beats of the science fiction form, especially the elements of time travel. Due to Gene Roddenberry's original premise of ""Wagon Train in space,"" Star Trek has always emphasized the spatial aspects of science fiction, as the Enterprise visits one new world after another. As the show's tag line states, ""Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life forms and new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before."" But this Star Trek is directed by J. J. Abrams, co-creator of Lost, whose brilliant fifth season has used the element of time travel better than it's ever been done before. In many ways, time travel is the key to rejuvenating the Star Trek franchise and making the origin story work. Time travel allows the writers to emphasize character change in a very plot-heavy genre – of many of the major characters – by jamming the characters' beginning and ending selves close together in time. It also lets the writers keep the narrative drive going fast and furious from the very opening on. Instead of spending the abnormally long time collecting allies that origin stories usually require, the Star Trek writers can sprinkle the introduction of the various team members throughout the story.<br/><br/>The final genre the authors of Star Trek used was drama. Mixing in drama elements is the main way you transcend any genre, because you are essentially taking a mythic hero and adding psychological depth and individuality. This is the main technique writer Tony Gilroy used in writing the Bourne films, and what Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis did when called on to rejuvenate and rewrite the origin story for James Bond in Casino Royale. In Star Trek the writers not only highlighted the moral and psychological needs of main characters Kirk and Spock, they also made the brilliant dramatic move of turning Kirk and Spock into lead opponents for a good part of the story.<br/><br/>Most of us writers never get the opportunity to rejuvenate a classic like Star Trek. But we can take on the challenge of telling a science fiction story so it has tremendous emotional impact on the audience. The choices the writers made in the new and improved Star Trek can teach us a lot about why science fiction has become one of the most popular genres in mainstream Hollywood film.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS please visit www.truby.com"

","I use to watch the original series with my father back in the '60's and I watched it in syndication most of my adult life. I was not opposed to a reboot, but the time travel/ alternate reality thing has been done to death. While I enjoyed the film, there were some troubling plot holes here and there. Here's a few I noticed: (1) Vulcan is minutes away from being destroyed and Spock decides to beam down to save his folks. He goes to the turbo-lift and heads to the transporter room. Kirk and Sulu are falling without a chute and Chekov gets up and runs around a few corners and into the transporter room. He beams up Kirk and Sulu and THEN Spock comes walking in. Where did he go? (BTW, how come Chekov could beam up Kirk and Sulu when they were falling but not Spocks mom when she was falling?)<br/><br/>(2)Cadet Kirk convinces Capt Pike that they are 'warping' into a trap. Pike orders the shields to be raised and when they arrive at Vulcan, the ship gets hammered by debris. Shields do not deflect debris?<br/><br/>(3)Black holes either destroy things OR can be used to time travel. It just depends on the needs of the story.<br/><br/>(4)Why could no one detect the supernova heading towards Romulus? Spock was supposed to stop it, but it consumes the planet before anyone knew what happened?<br/><br/>(5)As others have pointed out, one doesn't need to drill any holes in a planet if you can create a black hole.<br/><br/>Although he doesn't come off quite as 'cool' as a younger Nimoy, I still liked the casting of Zachary Quinto as Spock and the casting of Karl Urban was inspired. The ""Bones"" McCoy character was a true embodiment rather than a cheap imitation. Zoe Saldana was fine as Uhuru although the Spock/Uhuru romance was a bit too out of character for Spock. Simon Pegg was amusing as a younger, higher-energy Scotty and John Cho filled the Sulu role adequately. The portrayal of Chekov was over the top and quite annoying to me. Bruce Greenwood as Captain Pike injected just the right amount of gravitas and confidence into the role. I enjoyed every minute that he was on the screen. And that brings us to Chris Pine as Captain Kirk. As a fan of the original series, I found this Kirk to be lacking charm and grace. That 1960's Shatner had a swagger and was a master chess player in space battles. I'm not sure if it's the way it was written or his performance, but Pine plays Kirk as a class-A jerk with a bad attitude. The joy of the characters as they were originally written was the triangle of Spock, Kirk and McCoy. McCoy would loudly make his voice heard to the captain in one ear, with virtually no check on his emotions and Spock would be in his other ear, coolly stating the facts with no emotional bias. Kirk would take all of this input and more and invariably make the right choice. Pine's Kirk seems to get by on brashness, cockiness and determination. <br/><br/>(BTW, who had the awful idea of making a beer brewery into the Enterprise's engine room?)<br/><br/>The shaky cam bugged me a few times but the effects were very good. Overall, I enjoyed the film and was able to overlook many of the flaws because it was a great popcorn flick. 7 out of 10 stars"
"garydiamond","6","2","5","11 October 2009"," A mixed bag; better than the weaker Trek movies but not one of the best.
","Now, by no means is the 2009 iteration/reboot/alternate history of Star Trek a complete middle finger to Trek fans, as a lot of people reviewing this film seem to think. As an attentive but not obsessive fan I can say it has at least a little respect for the canon, although the philosophical questions/seeking out new life parts of the franchise are skipped in favour of flashy lens-flared action scenes. This will annoy the hardcore Trekkies, but to be honest these are things usually better handled in the episodes anyway. People go to the movies to be dazzled; with television they merely expect to be entertained.<br/><br/>The script/story isn't bad. There were a few loose threads that never really got tied, such as the time-dilation effect of Spock appearing 25 years after Nero even using the same wormhole, why young Kirk trashed a car, what the purpose of the Starfleet base on the ice world was other than a plot device to find Scotty, and - most jarring of all - what happened to the black hole created really near to Earth? But as the focus of the tale is making it an emotionally-charged epic and not worrying about realism, some of these can't be considered faults, merely realisation of the intentions of it's creators.<br/><br/>The applications of Trek staple ""psuedo-science"" were skipped in favour of a better plot, which worked sometimes but not always; obviously no-one working on this picture understands what a black hole actually is, let alone the impossibility that a dab of a mysterious liquid (creatively named red matter, nice job there) could create one on-the-fly. They certainly can't cause time-travel; that's usually attributed to a wormhole, I'm surprised no-one noticed such a glaring error. These were obviously skipped to keep the picture moving swiftly, to keep things fun and entertaining, and since the film never really drags it can be considered a modest success in this respect.<br/><br/>The cast has a couple of standouts: Chris Pine's Kirk carries the cocksure charm of the original, without resorting to copying Shatner's mannerisms and inflections, which I really appreciated and Spock, as played by Quinto, is given a lot more depth by a great performance. Both play conflicted men well and have probably set themselves up for their entire careers with this film. Bruce Greenwood makes the most of his Pike storyline, though I do wish he'd been given better dialogue to work with as he strikes me as the most believable Starfleet officer in this particular version. Nimoy's return as Spock Prime is enjoyable; though he does get a clunky, expositional monologue his prowess as an actor saves at least some of it; I think he sees the potential in this new approach to Trek.<br/><br/>Bones, Uhura, Scotty (and his Ewok-style mascot), Sulu and Chekov are misguided attempts to retain the campy humour and feel of the original series distilled into one-dimensional characters. I found all attempts at humour fell completely flat, with none of the actors able to master decent comic timing. Karl Urban is especially guilty; he tries too hard to copy DeForest Kelley instead of bringing his own personality to the show. This would still be a fun movie without the cheap jokes; the screen time could have been used for character development instead.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are uniformly excellent: all of the space battle shots and the exterior ship designs look great, from the fearsome appearance of the Romulan mining vessel to the sleek, guns-akimbo fighter-jet portrayal of the Enterprise. This made the space battles much more epic than your average Trek flick. The sets are good - I especially liked the bridge of the USS Kelvin, and the design of the Romulan vessel was superb internally - but some, like the brightly-lit sterile Enterprise bridge and the engineering section, which looked like a sewage treatment plant, do not fit a genre whose best moments are usually found in dark mood lighting.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this picture is far, far better than the two weak TNG outings it followed - Insurrection and Nemesis - but it can't live up to the three best Star Trek films (The Wrath of Khan, The Voyage Home and First Contact). It is, in some respects, another in a long line of action films that distracts from inconsistent pacing/scripting with impressive whizz-bang graphics and good-looking actors. It has the fun, feel-good appeal of an 80s film, but it also has some of the same superficiality, glossing over things that could have easily given the picture more depth and resonance. Something of a missed opportunity."
"spundog","7","2","5","29 September 2009"," Chris Pine, your mouth is ajar...
","I really wanted to love this movie, and after hearing many great reviews from friends and acquaintances i readied myself for a killer ride. I'll put it this way: You know how a great ride at an amusement park can be ruined by the wrong person sitting next to you? That's kind of how i feel about having Chris Pine portray James Kirk. First off, his voice has an almost cartoonish sound to it, kind of like ""Shaggy"" in the original Scooby Doo. Additionally, while most of the other actors go out of their way to infuse the soul of the original actor into their portrayals, Pine gives no effort whatsoever to do the same for William Shatner. The only thing he shares with Shatner is the tendency to overact. Every scene seems just a little too far over the top, whether it's for the sake of comedy or for the sake of drama. This guy seems out of his league in this role. The rest of the crew is well cast for the most part, even though Simon Pegg as ""Scotty"" also goes a little overboard at times. McCoy (Karl Urban) and Spock (Zac Quinto) are great, and Zoe Saldana as ""Uhura"" is a fox and plays an extremely sexy geek. She steals the scene whenever she's on camera. Eric Bana is a tremendous villain, and it's a testament to his acting that i didn't even realize it was him at first.<br/><br/>It seems to me that CG special effects have gotten to the point where I almost tune them out nowadays; the over-the-top action combined with predictable conclusions make some of these fight sequences almost tedious. I guess back in the day when they had model builders and cameramen who were struggling to get the shots, a sharper editorial sense was needed, and this was a bonus for the films in most cases. Nowadays it seems they trivialize the action by having too many things occur simultaneously, or by having things occur which are too far-fetched, and break you out of your suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a fun movie with lots of great action and some pretty good acting, but Chris Pine just spoiled it for me. From his voice to his mouth always hanging wide open as he searches for oxygen to feed his enormous dome (one fitting moment has Uhura referring to him as ""the mouth-breather""), the ride just wasn't as fun with him overacting next to me."
"Rizar","Null","2","5","14 September 2009"," We Still Have Faces in the Future!
","This generally did not feel like Star Trek. But at least we learn that people will still have faces in the future with the great number of camera close-ups!<br/><br/>It did take my breath away when it finally pulled back some and gave me a chance to see the bridge of Enterprise. I also enjoyed Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov and found him to be the most humorous part of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot follows a young Kirk from his roots as an Iowa farm boy, to Star Fleet Academy, and to Enterprise. He becomes competitive with a Vulcan, Spock, and he befriends Bones, and then he pushes his ship against improbable odds like a madman. The film dislikes anything as rational as probabilities (which always annoyed me in some Star Trek episodes, but certainly it isn't true of all of them).<br/><br/>It includes the use of black holes as weapons, talk of red matter, time travel, cool Vulcan educational machines, flashy modern computer consoles, & distant tracking of human vitals.<br/><br/>Artistically I thought the plot was too unbelievable: (1) Kirk gets promoted too swiftly. (2) Spock and the Vulcans are humanized so much I wonder whether they wanted to capture much of the essence of the Vulcans.<br/><br/>There was one good scene of the Vulcan philosophy explaining the stoical views of the Vulcans. Spock is told the importance of controlling his emotions as a way to free himself from being a slave of his passions. But most of the movie belittles Spock the way a drunk idiot would do at a party; I just wish the old Spock would have been there to bite back the way he always used to do against McCoy.<br/><br/>I was disgusted with the treatment of the Vulcans and found them so overly humanized that the film makers might as well have done away with any 'aliens'. I thought about walking out at one point.<br/><br/>The supposed alien races were so cuddly and so obviously marketed to please human audiences and their biases that the movie was a major letdown for me. But perhaps it's good for people who don't like the ethos of Star Trek and its ability to put our humanity into perspective, to inspire scientists to love our mastery of nature in the future (but without turning us into slaves of our very power), and its emphasis on cultures and ideas different from our norms. This Star Trek had none of that and merely fed us mirrors of ourselves.<br/><br/>I suppose a better comparison would be to Star Wars, but I didn't see any interesting 'bad guys' or fantastic powers and the humans are weaker than the Jedis, so Star Wars is also far superior in every way in my book."
"atropos3000","9","4","14","18 August 2019"," It's very good!
","I am a fan of Star Trek original and Next Generation, therefore I am god when it comes to judging all things Star Trek. This is as good as one would expect from Hollywood, nay...Gene Roddenberry who would recognize the extraordinary effort in to turning the 60's TV series and subsequent movies into the next sequence of Star Trek capitalistic bravura. Both James T Kirk and Jean Luc Picard would approve."
"smellysocks12","9","4","14","20 May 2009"," Great movie, also for non-fanatics
","I have never considered myself to be a Star Trek fan. As a matter of fact I actually never understood the big deal about the slow paced, static television series that is apparently loved by many ""Trekkies"" all over the world. In the sci-fi genre the Star Wars series was always considered to be superior by me, because of its sense of humor, great action scenes and in my opinion more likable species and characters. Having heard good things about this movie, I still went to see it with some friends who are more into Star Trek and I was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of action, humor and special effects to go around and the environment looks better than it has ever been. This all did not go at the expense of a good story. I liked the plot and while not overly complex, the story is complex enough to keep me interested. Having seen this movie I am enthusiastic for a new star trek movie by JJ Abrams."
"Aaron1375","9","4","14","17 May 2009"," The reboot to the Star Trek series my favorite Star Trek to date.
","I am not what you would consider a Trekkie. I am a casual viewer of the series at best. I watched some of the original series and it was okay to pass the time. I did not care for the Next Generation all that much oddly enough because while I like Patrick Stewart as an actor and in just about every role he played I disliked the character of Picard for whatever reasons. Still, my favorite characters from the whole Star Trek universe are the ones from the original show and the first six movies. Though I really disliked Star Trek the motion picture, which was the first Star Trek movie of any kind. This movie featured young versions of those characters and I found the movie was very well cast as I liked all the characters. The guys playing Kirk and Spock were great, the ones playing Dr. McCoy and Scottie were very funny, and the other cast members filled out the troupe quite nicely. The story had very good action, drama and lots of humor as well. The movie did not have a slow stretch in its entire running time. I only have minor complaints here and there mainly about how I would have liked to see more of Kirk's time at the Starfleet academy and a little better conclusion with the Romulan leader Nero, but this movie was very entertaining for the most part. The story basically has a time travel twist to it and I do not want to go into to deeply out of fear of revealing some of the plot, but it was very interesting and I was happy to see Leonard Nimoy had a bigger role in the film than I expected. Also, I loved Simon Pegg as Scotty, he takes a while to make his appearance in the film, but when he does he really makes an impact. So for a very fun, action packed and funny thrill ride beam aboard the new Star Trek movie."
"CaptSC","10","4","14","15 May 2009"," Surpasses my expectations in every way!
","As soon as I saw the first teaser trailer for Star Trek (the one that showed a person working on the Enterprise) I knew it would be special. Abrams knocked my socks off with Cloverfield, and Star Trek is even better.<br/><br/>I will not give away one detail, but the movie held me from the beginning to end.<br/><br/>Each cast member pulls their weight, I thought the Chris Pine and Zach Quinto especially deserve props. I would think that the casting of the new Kirk and Spock would be hardest to pull off, and they are AMAZING!!! I am a fan of the older movies, and this is definitely up there with ""Wrath of Kahn,"" if not better.<br/><br/>Worth your money and then some!"

My heart was beating of joy from beginning to end The plot was good and simple as in the original series. I'm not a hardcore Trekkie but I've seen all the episodes. I didn't like any of the star trek movies up to today. This time I left the cinema disappointed... I wanted more!<br/><br/>WELL DONE<br/><br/>G."
"kurtvogner","10","4","14","14 May 2009"," Addressing people's qualms
","If you're new to the series or haven't seen the movie, please don't read this. You don't need to read Trekker nitpicking. (Unless you've read many of the ""1 Star"" reviews, in which case, go for it, because I heartily disagree with them.)<br/><br/>Regarding claims of plot holes and damage to the franchise, I feel the need to address these claims to show that it is not a difference in familiarity/appreciation with ""good"" Star Trek films that makes me appreciate this installment:<br/><br/>""Kirk discovered the Romulans!"" That one was ruined a long time ago. Roughly around the time when the writers of the series decided that Romulans were Vulcans who refused to embrace Surak's reforms during the Time of Awakening. In other words, Vulcans knew about the Romulans. The Romulans probably didn't just disappear so that no one could find them. Both races obviously had warp capability, or at least the capability to explore as far as the distance to the other race. Do you think the Vulcans just forgot to mention them to the Federation when they joined? In all likelihood, I think that the Romulans probably brushed shoulders with Vulcans every once in a while, if only to growl and act treacherous. If humans and Vulcans could fly far enough to meet with each other, I find it really unlikely that they'd go so long without bumping into Romulans.<br/><br/>""Nero should have just warned the Romulans."" In his 25 spare years he probably did that. And the Romulans probably had no need to do anything just yet, as the cataclysm wouldn't happen for about 130 years. (I wouldn't jump to do anything drastic based on some guy saying ""In 130 years these dudes will be too slow to save you! Get mad and kill them!"") Nope, it would probably be up to Nero both to help his own people in whatever way he could (and in doing so, very likely reveal to them that the Federation existed, so that they might initiate contact with the Federation much sooner) and then take revenge on the Federation. This would be particularly desirable if he was unable to go back to a version of his own time in which his family was still alive. (Being a miner, he probably doesn't have the know-how to figure out how to create a black hole guaranteed to drop him right back there.) So, kill the Federation it is.<br/><br/>""They made it into an action flick! Ships don't fight like that!"" The only logical reason ships fought the way they did in the original series is that they didn't have the technology to produce good dogfights, and later just didn't want to risk copying Star Wars. Otherwise, they would be making the supposition that in the future, people will make incredibly expensive vessels, pack thousands of people on them, and rely on sheer power to defeat all threats to them. That's ridiculous. At worst, smart commanders would have a large, cumbersome ship that would deploy smaller, maneuverable ships that would strike out at the other vessel and its own defense ships, battleship/fighter style. The other alternative is to have the ships themselves be maneuverable. The traditional Star Trek ""Let's hail them and see if they're willing to talk it out. OK they're not fire everything!!!"" approach is really rather silly. Because not every ship can rely on being the flagship of the most powerful group of space travelers in order to win their fights. Other races would know that they were destined to lose these fights and desperately avoid them, an avenue which non-Federation races constantly refuse to take throughout the series.<br/><br/>""They used the oldest trick in the book to go back in time and AUUUGH EVERYTHING'S SO IMPLAUSIBLE!"" Now, I can sympathize with disliking things that are implausible. But for the sake of entertainment, I sometimes let things go. Like when I watched STAR TREK IV.<br/><br/>Do you remember that one? When Spock was sitting on the bridge and suddenly decided, ""Gee, we really need to go 300 years back in time. I bet we could do this by flying around the sun really fast. Let me do some math here... Yep! I checked guys, this works. Let's do it.""<br/><br/>Really? REALLY? Don't you think that if time travel was that simple, someone else would have tried it? Don't you think that it would take more than 30 seconds to figure out correctly? Do you really think that Spock just happens to be miraculously smarter than every character on any series of the show, ever? (Aside from Q, maybe.) Time travel cannot be that easy, therefore plot holes are allowed in Star Trek. Accept it. If you want to complain about things, try the weather. There's plenty to get upset about there, and least then you won't be discouraging people from enjoying something great.<br/><br/>Also, almost every adventure movie ever relies on SOMETHING extremely unlikely happening. Kirk landing near Spock is not by any means the worst of them."
"dhardee","10","4","14","13 May 2009"," Damn it Jim, I'm a Dr., not a movie reviewer!
","This was a simply wonderful reboot of the Star Trek franchise. It was fast, exciting, funny, sad, and gorgeous to watch. The casting was perfect for such well known roles and the actors brought just enough of the original characters along with subtle differences that show this really is an alternate time line. In fact, the only caricatures I've seen are the annoyed Trek ""purists"" who all seem massively upset that Abrams and company didn't actually break any canon but rather made their entire holy book obsolete. Their whining write ups sound like they're auditioning for a part on the next Galaxy Quest to make fun of themselves."
"3xHCCH","10","4","14","12 May 2009"," Superlative Movie - And That's No Hyperbole!
","I am definitely giving this movie a ten star rating. I'd give it more if I could. This is the best movie I have seen so far this year! I am not a serious Trekkie by any means. I know the members of the crew of the Original Series, but not with too much familiarity. But for a casual Star Trek fan like me, this prequel is really excellent! Excellent story. Excellent casting. Excellent technicals. Excellent execution.<br/><br/>The film begins with the birth of James Tiberius Kirk and it never lets up on the drama, the action, the science fiction, no holds barred. There is heavy drama even before the credits. (My wife already was teary-eyed by the end of that sequence!) Even when the story grapples with time travel, warps and black holes, you never get lost with the flow. The logic is always there. None of the usual plot holes that beset stories that deal with time.<br/><br/>I really have to complement the casting director. The new cast is amazing in its portrayal of the crew which millions of fans know and loved over the years. They have collectively succeeded in recapturing the spirit and character of the individual Enterprise crew members as young cadets. Kudos to Chris Pine as J.T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock. They really possess the essence of the characters, and the evolution of their friendship is very believable as portrayed. Apart from John Cho (as Sulu), the other actors are not really known to me, and this is an additional plus. The guy who played the young Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) also did very well, as with the guy who played Scotty (Simon Pegg).<br/><br/>I congratulate the director J. J. Abrams for this bold visual spectacle that went well beyond my expectations. I went in the movie house with very high expectations due to the very positive word of mouth. I was definitely NOT disappointed. I exhort all of you to watch this movie on the big screen as it deserves to be watched. I think this movie would be a classic the appeal of which will never fade even after repeated viewings."
"blackmamba99971","10","4","14","11 May 2009"," What a thrill ride
","Well i have to say that this film was in every form top notch. To see the young james t. kirk inexperienced and down right brash in everything he does reminds me of what William shatner had done in the early years. This cast was excellent in every way Karl Urban as bones, Chris Pine as kirk and Zachery Quinto as Spock who i thought was a dead ringer for the real Spock. Eric bana also as a romulan who went berserk trying to get revenge on Spock for causing the destruction of Romulus in the future. The story was fantastic showing us the academy years between kirk and his team mates was fabulous. Space scenes were imaginative with complex battles as well as some excellent shots of atmosphere entries. This blew away the old star trek genre with Patrick Stewart and looking back they were kind of lame in some sense. But still kept my feelings about star trek true since every generation must learn from the first. And this one was the very best representation of how it all started. Wonderful film."
"vip_ebriega","9","4","14","11 May 2009"," Beam me up Scotty! I'm ready to be a Star Trek fan.
","My Take: This new STAR TREK is bound to recapture the hearts of its fans, while also being accessible to a wider audience.<br/><br/>I usually go see movies in theaters when it's worth it. As much as possible, I really don't want to see a movie I can see for free on television. If I only get to go in theaters this year, I'm glad, thus far, that among them is STAR TREK. It's one of the biggest and, in my opinion, one of the very best movies of the summer so far. If this is the only movie I see this summer, I still wouldn't feel so swindled.<br/><br/>Let me start by pointing out that I'm not a Trekkie (Trekker?), but I did see enough Star Trek movies, even loved a few (STAR TREK III and IV so far), to familiarize me enough with these characters. Other than that, my loyalties to this are extremely limited. But it turns out, I could buy a ticket and not know anything about STAR TREK, and I still will come out having a grand time at the movies. I always thought STAR TREK as a film franchise, whilst not exactly strong blockbuster contenders, have mostly been interesting on the big screen, alternating spaced-out action sequences with space opera and Shakespearean villains, but this new STAR TREK is probably the best so far, particularly because the film opens its doors to other than its fans. Trek fans may reunite, but everyone will still have enough fun with STAR TREK. I sure did! <br/><br/>The movie serves as both a prequel as well as a reboot to the screen franchise, while it's also a great way for fans to catch up with the dangling threads left behind by their beloved characters. The movie opens with the introduction of George Kirk, the first officer of the federation ship The Kelvin, who takes command of the vessel when it's attacked by Romulans, led by the vengeful Captain Nero (the scenery-chewing Eric Bana). He's, of course, none other than the father of the then-famous James Tiberius Kirk. Forward 22 years later, grows up into a rebellious youth (Chris Pine), wasting the good name of the father he never really knew. But during a brawl in a bar, he is inspired by a Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in the Starfleet Academy. It's so nice to see everyone's favorite characters refreshingly enjoyable again. Though it's a stretch, it's nice to see Kirk as a sort of rebel without a cause and Nyota Uhura (then played by Nichelle Nichols) as a sexy, miniskirt-clad Zoe Saldana. It's also nice to see ""Doc Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), Hikaru Zulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and especially Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott (who else but Simon Pegg) in their younger forms after (or is that before? Never mind) their shoes were worn by the late DeForrest Kelley, George Takei, Walter Koenig and James Doohan. But perhaps the most delightful is Zachary Quinto's impression of Mr. Spock, baring both a sort of uncanny resemblance and impersonation. When he does an impression of Spock's trademark eyebrow raise, I cheered.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons I liked the original STAR TREK movies is the camaraderie and quirky relationship between these characters. These characters probably wouldn't be nearly as effective as individual folk, but are always so good together. Seeing them, as if for the first time, on J.J. Abrams new STAR TREK is having that very same feeling Michael J. Fox' character in BACK TO THE FUTURE felt upon seeing his parents as teenagers. It's nice to see these characters we know and love, yet being acquainted with them in a different way. For anyone looking for a more contemporary comparison, Batman fans felt the same feeling when they saw BATMAN BEGINS and later, THE DARK KNIGHT.<br/><br/>The plot is a stretch to be sure, taking place in the past while creating a sort of alternate reality that changes the outcome of the future events portrayed in the previous movies, but in such an event, plot contrivances don't matter as long as the plot can carry the film's 126 minutes and is able to reintroduce us to these characters we have known and loved. There's even a cameo/bit role by Leonard Nimoy, reminding us of the things of the past (or is that the future? Whatever). But fan you may be or not, STAR TREK is a fast, highly entertaining and exciting blockbuster with some genuine excitement and a few great laughs along the way. This 'Trek' is a nostalgia trip at warp speed that's bound to live long and prosper in all of us for years to come.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","I am not a Star Trek fan. I know who Captain Kirk is, I have heard of Spock, Scotty and a Klingon, although admittedly all I know of them is if you get one of the starboard bow you are screwed. I went to see Star Trek not to pick plot holes, inconsistencies with the original or to have a bitch in general - I went solely because it looked like a good movie.<br/><br/>The opening scene focuses on George Kirk, father of James T, becoming Captain of the Enterprise and rescuing eight hundred people in a total of twelve minutes, sacrificing his life in the process. The opening battle was beautifully shot - the sound of the explosions were muted and we had the pleasure of hearing a simple orchestral score over the action. It was the kind of shot a lesser movie would have ended on rather that opened with. This was a good sign.<br/><br/>The movie follows the known crew of the Enterprise though their first battle with the Romulans the leader of them being Eric Banas Nero whose reasons for his mass genocide of the Vulcan race was actually the most confusing in cinematic history. <br/><br/>The plot, apart from the confusing Romulan back-story was very strong and there were some genuinely funny moments, all of which were intentional. Simon Pegg, Karl Urban and Chris Pine were all very capable of playing such legendary characters but the casting of Winona Ryder as Spocks mother did throw me slightly -either her life of crime as aged her drastically or else her digital ageing was completely unnecessary - just cast someone of the appropriate age or if you feel the need to add a star cameo for the love of god pick an actual star!<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised about how good this movie actually was. I am glad it was an early summer blockbuster as it may have gotten lost in the Transformers2 of T4 hype but it thoroughly enjoys its success and if there is a sequel I would go and see it.<br/><br/>I would give the movie a rare 10/10. I don't know if it was consistent with the original series and I don't care that I probably missed a ton of in-jokes and throw backs to the TV show but what I do know from my complete and utter newbie point of view is that last night I saw a bloody impressive movie. <br/><br/>Bring on the sequel."

","Incredible film. Watched it last night in IMAX and it was action packed from beginning to end. I have been a fan of the trek series since the 70's and have watched all of the TV shows and films. This is a reboot. Something new and fresh and it's meant to be. If you are fan of the series and films, watch it, you wont be disappointed. If you have never seen a Trek film before you will be entertained and most likely become an instant fan. The characters are very likable and portray the old crew surprisingly well. The space scenes and CGI were excellent. I could not have asked for better. I am ready to watch it again and looking forward to another film with this cast."
"TheHande","9","4","14","8 May 2009"," ""Where no-one has gone before.""
","Without speculating the long lasting effects of this movie on the franchise's continuity, Star Trek is a brilliant movie. It offers a brilliant fresh look on the franchise while retaining enough classic elements to keep you locked in and involved with the characters.<br/><br/>One of the things which Star Trek does well is tell a dramatic story. Upto the point where Spock's mother dies the film feels rather well setup but after continuity becomes disrupted you're left in the dark as to how the movie ends. This shock value undoubtedly wears off on later viewings but keeps you involved none the less.<br/><br/>The great thing about the film is how it allows all the classic Trek-figures to don the spotlight. Uhura undoubtedly less than the guys though her involvement with Kirk and Spock does make for interesting viewing. Hands down my favorite performance came from Karl Urban as McCoy and it really felt as if DeForrest Kelley had come back from the dead. In fact all of the new actors inhabit the base-traits of their predecessors well and there is no lack of continuity experienced in the new cast, even with more outlandish casting decisions as Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>The only thing that's disappointing about the movie is it's emphasis on action, which is based definitely more on film marketing than cinematic artistic merit. The shaky camera-work seems most out of place for a Star Trek film but this new bold direction for the franchise only serves to launch what I believe to be a new series of films.<br/><br/>In all Star Trek leaves you with a great feeling that the movie has taken you through a great journey. I hope that the sequels will keep building more on the characters and that this New-Old Trek series will have a good run.<br/><br/>Live long and prosper."

","After seeing the trailer I had high hopes for this new franchise, and it did not let me down. Terrific cast, and a terrific new NCC 1701. The movie had humor, and substance. The characters did there homework, and did a splendid job with the adaptation. Simon Pegg your the man dude. The few complaints are significant enough for me to talk about. Firstly the space action sequences are way to fast for you to absorb. They need to slow this amazing cgi down so you can actually see what's happening. this is also a problem with transformers. Uhura's love interest, Im not feeling it, it does not work. That's it Im done complaining. the film is excellent, and I will be seeing this again this time on IMAX. 9.99 for me."
"sdevore1138","10","4","14","8 May 2009"," Amazing!
","Saw this last night. Went in pretty skeptical. It's been a long, long time since I've been excited about a Star Trek movie. But wow, this was a great piece of entertainment! It was suspenseful, awe-inspiring, clever, and funny all at the same time...and overall just a joy to watch. ""Fun"" is probably the best word to describe it. It was like spending time with some old friends and being reminded of what you loved about them in the first place. Plus, it illuminates a chapter of Star Trek lore that we've never seen and never really heard much about. There were no cringe-worthy moments, and I'd really struggle to find anything negative to say about this movie.<br/><br/>As far as the performances, the standouts to me were Anton Yelchin as Chekov (had the accent down perfectly), Karl Urban as McCoy (really worked hard to pay homage to DeForest Kelly's version), and Zoe Saldana (I never realized Uhura was hot...did you?) Simon Pegg's Scotty was hilarious and shows up at the perfect time in the story. He just nailed it. I look forward to seeing more of him in the inevitable sequels.<br/><br/>Chris Pine makes a great debut here and includes extremely subtle Shatner-isms in his performance. From his chest-puffed walk, to little, barely discernible facial expressions and eye movements will remind you of Shatner from time to time, without the stilted delivery of a cliché Jim Carrey-style impersonation, thank God. He makes a great young Kirk who you can easily imagine growing into the Captain we know from the original series and especially the later movies.<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto probably had the hardest job in this movie, considering his classic counterpart (Leonard Nimoy) is actually in the film for real-time comparison. I've never seen Heroes, so I wasn't sure what to expect from him, but I thought he did a pretty good job considering the challenges of the role. He didn't remind me of Leonard Nimoy at all, but I could see him fit as a younger, slightly more emotional Spock than we've ever seen on screen. Let's face it, those are big shoes to fill, especially when he's in the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised and had a great night at the movies. I'd recommend this to any former fan who has since given up on Star Trek. It's a whole new experience of the franchise. And for those who have never been a fan, but know all the pop-culture references of all the characters...I think those are the people who are really going to love it. Highly recommended for anyone and everyone really.<br/><br/>I'll definitely be seeing this again this weekend.<br/><br/>Go see it!"

Meeting and exceeding expectations on the long needed visual upgrade, J.J.

"thingadonta","7","4","14","7 May 2009"," Not entirely Roddenberry
","I found this Star Trek prequel mixed. Spock and Kirk and co. back in their Academy days. Huge plot potential. Is it well done?? Yes, and no.<br/><br/>The 2009 Star Trek is more complicated in plot than the 1960s style, more difficult to follow, and the characters resemble Melrose Place on steroids. People assume command without structure, risk taking has become more prevalent than ever, and Roddenberry's 1960s humanist-style idealism has been a little compromised. A little harsh maybe, but the 1960s Star Trek was visionary in terms of its humanist ideals, whilst this relies more on basic Hollywood action formulas than vision and substance. There are good, mild references to issues concerning unconscious racism, but not much else. There is no real build up of tension in this film (incidentally, Kirk's 'dramatic pause' has long gone from Hollywood, which I always liked), or mysterious twists in the plot, just one action scene blasts onto another. Outside of Spock and Kirk, character development is weak, including the villain (a time-disaffected Romulan), who gets about 10 seconds of back story.<br/><br/>For some reason it's rather crowded on the bridge now-there are no open spaces on these ships anymore. Spock and Kirk's relationship has changed-there is more disagreement, and less general co-operation. Kirk's entire first foray into space is essentially as a stowaway and illegal, yet he is able to assume command of a starship, with barely a whisper from anyone else. Time travel scenarios now go on so often in these Star Trek plots that there are people doubles everywhere, where you can bump into yourself, young or old, and the whole 'stability of the time-line concept' is a bit of a joke (although the original series did introduce these conundrums). Villains now have the entire time scale to plunder and pillage, especially the past, which is weaker technologically. Thankfully, reality isn't like that (excepting real-time cultural imperialism).<br/><br/>I wish they wouldn't use hand held cameras in every single action scene, so that you can no longer see what the hell is going on. It's dizzying, nauseating, and frustrating. Why does Hollywood always have to overplay a good idea? Hand held shots originally gave a feel of proximity and authenticity (usually in a documentary sense), but now every damn action scene has it. The brain actually has a natural 'image stabilizer' (you don't see dizzying images going up and down and all around you, do you-unless the images are moving at such speeds and to the point where the brain can't compensate anymore-which is not the typical action scene 'moving speed'), so one doesn't experience such shaking, dizzying, and moving images at normal action speeds; therefore overplaying the hand-held camera effect actually becomes self-defeating-you actually feel more like you are behind a camera, which is the exact opposite to what is intended. This is damn annoying, and overdone. I wish they would limit it to extreme action and speed changes (eg like a car accident), where it belongs.<br/><br/>Good special effects, an excellent opening scene (where we see Kirk's father and mother), a reasonable time-travel and coming-of-age plot, but I would have liked it as more circumspect and introspective (think Blade Runner, Batman Begins), humanist (1960s Star Trek), or ' basically gritty' (12 Monkeys), than Melrose Place or Top Gun in Space. But at least it's better than the overly simplified and dramatically weak Star Wars prequels."
"brotkernmehl","6","4","14","6 May 2009"," all in all a solid action movie
","i've just seen this movie in a German cinema. i'll try to be as objective as i can as a star trek fan.<br/><br/>first of all an apology for bad grammar.<br/><br/>overall its a solid action movie with minor plot problems. acceptable acting from all the protagonists. its impressive how well some roles are filled with people you could actually mistake for younger versions of the original actors. <br/><br/>the special effects are pretty good, you could compare them with transformers1. there is some decent ship to ship combat and also nice large scale effects for example the implosion of a whole planet. so if you don't care that someone jumping out of a shuttle from orbit, diving down through the atmosphere and landing on an 25m² platform doesn't burn up this might be right for you.<br/><br/>and for all the Trekkie's out there: keep your hands off this one!!<br/><br/>don't get me wrong this film really isn't bad but thats not enough. the spirit and the essence of the series and films is gone. for example the protagonists don't even try to communicate with an attacking unidentified vessel. the humanity, diplomacy, solving problems through knowledge and finding a non violent solution to a problem. for me this has always been the essence of star trek but there seems to be nothing left of it.<br/><br/>imagine Spock and kirk fighting hand to hand on the bridge of the enterprise! there is so much chaos in this film so many things that are hard to believe if you know the original series.<br/><br/>there are even cardassian drinks served in a bar on earth! well you could look over that but when i sum up all the small glitches it makes me kind of sad.<br/><br/>so when the romulans destroy Vulcan, by using ""rote materie in German, would be red matter in English"" something completely undefined. it just exists and is capable of creating black holes. so the romulans drill their way into the core of the planet and after that send some red matter in. this way a black hole is created probably induced due to the heat of the planets core. so why not create that black hole somewhere on the surface? you think: OK the time line can still be restored but no. it actually stays this way. this film sends star trek into an alternate reality rendering all the other series and films obsolete."
"Macleanie","9","4","15","18 June 2019"," Perfect introduction to Star Trek
","Shamefully this 2009 movie was pretty much my first full experience of what the Star Trek franchise has to offer. I have never been a fan and was completely new to the series. I have since begun to understand its following although I'm glad to have started with JJ Abrams remake as it was the perfect introduction. As a science fiction action movie it ticked all the boxes and had a well crafted cast which made watching this movie thoroughly enjoyable. The story is along the lines of what I expected going into it but together with its effects and smart script it was smooth and sleek. I really enjoyed learning how these characters came together and involved more action than I participated, much to my delight."
"SophomoreSlump","10","4","15","10 May 2009"," Phenomenal!
","Director JJ Abrams has outdone himself this time with this new Star Trek reboot/prequel. It simply tells the story of the early days of Captain Kirk and Mr Spock from the Star Trek we all know and love. But the difference between this and the original TV series and movies is that this Star Trek has the privilege of special effect visualization.<br/><br/>The visual effect is astounding! JJ Abrams managed to create something as massive as a planet and the USS Enterprise look so real. It is like we are there. To add to the realism, there are creative uses of lens flare (those lights that are reflected at the screen throughout the movie) that makes it look like the camera is actually out there filming the scenario.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is epic. It has the combination of orchestra and choir which really complement the sequence shown.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that there are several silent scenes showing the outer space. One where the Romulan drilling vessel is attacking the Federation starship. The Federation starship is damaged, a silhouette of a crew member drifting in outer space with explosions and shooting still going on in the background, yet there is no sound. And when Kirk and Sulu dive from the Enterprise to enter Vulcan, there was only silence until after they enter the planet's atmosphere. Usually, a sci-fi film would ignore the fact that sound can't travel in vacuum to make a scene seem cooler. But the fact that Star Trek acknowledges this just adds more to its realism.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting; everyone was great. The star of this movie is, obviously, Chris Pine as James T. Kirk, showing off the character's rebellious and cocky, and ultimately, leadership side. Zachary Quinto playing the iconic Spock was logical. He may not have the same deep and commanding voice Leonard Nimoy has, but the other resemblance of characteristic is undeniable. The rest of the crew -- Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Karl Urban as McCoy, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov, and especially Simon Pegg as the babbling Scotty -- did an appraisable job forming a team that would make Star Trek lasts throughout the ages. And of course Leonard Nimoy himself had no problem taking back the role of the original Spock.<br/><br/>This movie is for everyone. No matter if you're a trekkie, a film-addict or just a casual movie-goer, you will be purely entertained as I did.<br/><br/>The directing is superb. The editing and camera angles are sleek. The storyline and the storytelling itself is very engaging; holding your breath and grabbing your attention in the most mind-numbing sequence, Star Trek is everything a summer blockbuster should be like."

","Star Trek is an entertaining sci-fi action adventure remake. I thought there were some flaws which I'll get to later but the good more than outweighed the bad with this one. Director J. J. Abrahams has done an admirable job of bringing this movie to the big screen and he continues to show his talent as a filmmaker. Well done. Star Trek has it all character development, action, drama, suspense, humor, and a little romance. The cast including John Cho as Sulu, Bruce Greenwood as Pike, Karl Urban as Bones, Zoe Saladana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty, and Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime are very effective in their limited screen time. Winona Ryder shows up for a cameo role as Spocks mother and she's good in her brief part. The two stands outs were Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. They both were impressive as their characters who the story seemed to focus on the most. The two characters I found to to be a little weak in the cast were Anton Yelchin as Chekov mainly because his Russain accent was a bit strong at times and Eric Bana as the villain Nero a Romulan Captain with a major grudge who doesn't have much to do except look mad. They both are talented actors and weren't in it all that much anyways so neither of them really hurt the film. But I just thought their performances weren't as good as others. No offense. The action sequences are well paced with a compelling story and amazing special effects that help bring the film to life. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this movie but I enjoyed up liking it. Star Trek was much better than G.I. Joe or Wolverine which weren't the greatest films at least to me. I felt entertained after watching this movie so it's definitely worth seeing. Overall despite some flaws if you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi adventure with character development, action, suspense, drama, and humor. Then look no further Star Trek is the movie for you. It won't disappoint."
"racinGSRstyle","1","3","10","3 October 2009"," Flawed, but still pretty damn good
","7.7 / 10 <br/><br/>First I'd like to say that despite my 1/10 vote (to bring it down from top 250, doesn't belong there in my opinion) I give this movie a 7.7 out of 10. I pick this number randomly, not only because I am new to reviewing films on IMDb and it is really hard for me to pick a number out of 10, but also because it was pretty god damn good but definitely not perfect (mountains are crumbling, but people are walking/running without impediment!). So, based on films in the top 250 and their 8+ out of 10, I'll go with a 7.7.<br/><br/>This movie had a few flaws, ones that I commented on and elicited laughter from my fellow men and women. BUT it was very entertaining. I was more of a Star Wars than Star Trek kinda guy, and never really experienced the original series (although I have seen all of the films), but I did very much enjoy the Next Generation episodes I used to watch as well as Deep Space 9 and all of the movies. With that said, if the prequels to Star Wars had been this good (I have to admit I did enjoy Revenge of the Sith a lot), this might (might) have been #1 of 250 after opening instead of whatever it is currently at. Then again, who am I to say that Star Wars is more popular than Star Trek.<br/><br/>In any case, I really enjoyed this film and think it is worth a look whether you are a film buff, Star Trek buff, or just have 10+ dollars burning a hole in your pocket for 2 hours of enjoyment. There is no reason not to watch this movie unless you have something against good movies or something/someone involved with this one.<br/><br/>7.7 / 10"

"BGarrett03","10","3","10","11 May 2009"," Best, most entertaining movie since..well, i don't know when.
","a couple of things to make clear before i tell ya what i think of the film.<br/><br/>Yes, i've seen every Star Trek movie. Yes, I was a fan of TNG as a kid, and a semi-fan of DS9. I've watched a few episodes of the original series, and think it was fine. Voyager and Enterprise were LAME.<br/><br/>Now. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. Honestly, I cannot remember seeing a better, more exciting movie in theaters since Terminator 2.<br/><br/>J.J. and company have breathed a new, invigorating life into what I have long considered to be a dying or dead franchise (basically since the end of TNG, especially that last movie where they killed Data. LAME. Though DS9 got a lot better when they added Worf)<br/><br/>Boohoo, there's a Cardassian. Wahhhh they know about Romulans. From seeing the movie, you can tell that it was never meant to be entirely canon, although to the naked, virgin eye, it appears to be. And I believe the naked virgin eye is the set that J.J. was trying to appeal to, while at the same time trying not to p*** off too many Trekkie's. But lets face it, Trekkie's, you were already p***ed off before you even saw the movie. Please, take your complaints to the next Star Trek convention, to which I'm sure the new cast will be invited.<br/><br/>The cast is BRILLIANT, especially Simon Pegg as Scotty. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto really pull off the Kirk/Spock dynamic well, in the end, and I must say, Chris Pine plays a purely bad ass Kirk. <br/><br/>Anyway, don't miss this movie. Go see it in theaters though, a big screen and a loud surround sound really add to the excitement of the picture."
"Sweettina135","7","3","10","11 May 2009"," Entertaining Film, Could've Been Better (Coming From a Non-Trekkie)
","If you aren't a Trekkie and you're unsure as to whether or not you'd enjoy this film, well, here's the skinny on it, and I'll let you decide. The group I went with consisted of 6 people: One enjoyed it but wanted to see more of the kid versions of Kirk and Spock, another doesn't like Sci-Fi therefore didn't enjoy it, two Trekkies loved it, one was bored by the special effects but liked the dialog, and then there was me, who felt the following.<br/><br/>What I Liked About It....<br/><br/>1. The dialog was quick and witty - the writers did a great job with that for this film.<br/><br/>2. The casting was fantastic. Chris Pine was definitely the highlight with his rebellious, cocky, and flirty take on Kirk. Zachary Quinto followed close behind with his heartfelt interpretation of a young Spock, struggling between feeling and not feeling emotion. All of the other actors did a great job as well.<br/><br/>3. As a film editor, I love looking for stand-out filming techniques in movies and television, and with Abrams, this was a sure thing. Once again, the shots were superb and engaging.<br/><br/>4. The special effects. The team who worked on this aspect of the film is a very talented bunch. Each effect lit up the screen and oozed second by second with outstanding detail.<br/><br/>5. The Kirk & Spock plot lines: Kirk's growth to being Captain and Spock's growth to actually showing some sort of emotion.<br/><br/>6. Young Spock and Old Spock on screen together. It was like seeing double vision! Very cool.<br/><br/>What I Didn't Like About It....<br/><br/>1. The movie had some incredibly corny moments that it could've done without: Kirk in the snow and being chased by that giant creature. It was both unnecessary to the plot and looked incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>2. There were at least a couple drawn out scenes that could've been either removed or cut in half. While I love Abrams in some aspects, this is one that often irritates me. He has trouble getting to the point quickly. Most of his shows, it takes a few episodes for things to actually pick up.<br/><br/>3. The special effects. While I said before, that they looked great, the non-film editor in me feels they were much too overused. I would've preferred more of the character interactions and dialog rather than watching a bunch of fancy effects fill up the space of the movie.<br/><br/>4. The plot line. The battle with the Romulans was vague and lacked depth. There wasn't much reasoning behind what they were doing except that the Romulans were attacking them. <br/><br/>5. Young Spock and Old Spock being seen together. While it was very cool, it was also very unnecessary and did not bring any more to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film to those of you who don't watch Star Trek. It's very enjoyable and intriguing, even if at some points, you find yourself wondering, ""What's going on?"" If you're a sucker for quick wit dialog you'll be sure to love the moments when the characters are actually interacting!"

I'll be honest, I'm not a Trekkie, yet I consider myself more knowledgeable about the Star Trek universe than the general public so I had expectations, and boy were they false! This movie is a technological masterpiece! The SFX just blew my mind with all the attention to detail and realism that they had. The sound effects were brilliant, every hit and punch would go through your ribcage and the score is fantastic.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the early years of James Tiberius Kirk and his crew as they meet each other for the first time, I have to mention this but I'm sure the fans were having a blast every time a ""new"" character was introduced. The plot has several twists and turns but it's not too complex and the regular movie goer will understand it.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing to write home about, don't expect any Oscar nominations for it, but the actors carried their roles pretty well making them likable and real. Don't expect anything that will blow your mind from the acting department although it was solid.<br/><br/>Now I'd like to address the issue of the ""cheesiness"" I hear people complaining about, this movie is Star Trek and it's supposed to be cheesy just as Doctor Who needs to be quirky, it's part of the charm the series has.<br/><br/>Overall I'd recommend this movie to every Trekkie, sci-fi fan and even your average movie goer, watch it you won't regret it."

","I have been a Star Trek fan since I caught the Original Series in reruns back in the early 70's. I am a huge fan of TOS and I was a bit concerned that JJ ABrams would turn this franchise into a 90120 in outer space and abandon the core values of Trek left to us by the Creator, Gene Roddenberry. After seeing the movie last night at our IMAX theater, my worries evaporated and morphed into uncontainable excitement and wonder. This new Trek was a mind-blowing experience, the stunning visuals and special effects, Abrams was able to communicate the spectacular feeling of being in space and truly showing how magnificent the USS Enterprise is in her element.<br/><br/>The actors were amazing and brought each of the icons they were playing to life. Chris Pine oozed cockiness and leadership, Zachacy Quinto made you feel Spock's inner turmoil and conflicted emotions and Karl Urban WAS ""Bones"" McCoy. The rest of the cast was, pardon the pun, stellar. Zoe Saldana brought a great charm and intelligence to Uhura, John Cho exhibited his swordsmanship and humor and the oh so young Alton Yelchin played Chckov's accent up in a believable manner yet got to show off his mad science skills. Special kudos to Bruce Greenwood for bringing Captain Christopher Pike to life and being a mentor to the rebellious young Kirk.<br/><br/>This is the best Star Trek since The Wrath of Khan. It has the depth of emotion we expect from Star Trek while still telling an amazing space opera story that takes you into the depths of outer space as well as the depths of human & Vulcan emotion. Eric Bana's Nero is the weakest element of the story. With a running time just over two hours, they just couldn't fit more of his back story in which leaves his character a bit unfinished in the movie. The writers of the film did do a prequel graphic novel that explains how the events of this movie were triggered and fills out the Nero back-story. If you love this film and want to know more, I highly recommend the Star Trek: Countdown graphic novel. Otherwise, this movie blew all of my expectations out of the water and more than thrilled me with the confidence that JJ Abrams and company know exactly how to make a Star Trek epic. This franchise will boldly go and live long and prosper with this cast and crew. A must see movie for Trekker and newcomer alike."
"jennifer23-3","10","4","16","6 May 2009"," The character casting and well thought plot will make this a great hit!
","I was very lucky to be able to see the pre-screen for this movie on Monday at the AMC Studio 30 and I am still in complete awe of how great of a movie this is! I will not go into a lot of details, as I hate spoilers, just the basic comments. First, they were spot on with all the casting, these ""new"" faces do an excellent job to honor the original cast. My personal favorite is the new Bones. The plot is a little confusing in the beginning, but the suspense is rewarding as the storyline opens. Some of the fight scenes are a little too fast, and I would suggest sitting far enough away from the screen to adjust for this. There were moments in the theater when the whole audience clapped and laughed, and I don't think anyone walked away disappointed in any respect. I was fortunate enough to be sitting with two older gentlemen who were 1st generation Trekkies, and even they were overjoyed with the movie. The best thing about this movie is that you don't have to be a hardcore Star Trek fan, or even a big fan of sci-fi to be able to appreciate this movie. I don't see how anyone could come out of it with a bad experience. I would not doubt if this leads to a whole new world of new movies for another generation to enjoy!"

","Star Trek 2009 is a fantastic film, it spawns a new telling of the Star Trek story from th 1969 tv series helmed by director J.J. Abrams. Abrams reimagines all of these character full filling there famous roles. The casting in of the character was so carefully handled, not just to fill the shoes but to breath life into Abrams vision and take. From the opening of this film it is hard to catch your breath. The Film is full of excitement and spectacle with a concise and neat story. Throughout the movie he characters are aleays faced with problems and are forced to work together and this makes very good relationships between the ensemble cast of characters and develops the characters. The cinematography helps with the pacing a lot. Sweeping shots on the bridge and dutch angle accomplish this. The shooting style is very busy, often times, more than one problem will arise for more than one character in the same shot. This creates a sense of urgency and momentum while aiding in character development and it never feels too bloated. The Score by Michael Giaccino is very underrated and undervalued. The main theme is very memorable and brings excitement with character victories and also helps with the pace from the get go. The visual effets hold up to this day, they seem almost flawless. I highly recommend you watch it or if you haven't seen it recently, watch it again"
"phd_travel","7","3","11","8 February 2010"," Quite good even if you are not a trekkie
","I enjoyed this movie even though I am not a trekkie - just enjoyed the original series but never followed any of the subsequent series. <br/><br/>Good points: <br/><br/>Story: It was quite enjoyable in the beginning when they set up the backgrounds of Kirk and Spock. Although Kirk's maverick rebellious style was a little annoying. The casting was quite good overall. Quinto was right for the role. Saldana is quite elegant. Chris Pine looks a little haggard for his age. Anton Yelchin's Russian accent is a bit too hard to understand. Wish we could have seen more Winona.<br/><br/>Effects: The slightly old fashioned and not over the top effects is a good contrast to the dizzying new scifi movies. What happens to the cast looks quite realistic except Kirk getting beaten up too much. <br/><br/>Bad points: The time travel element was a little bit bewildering - might have to watch twice. Some of the action in the latter part also seemed to jump from one scene to the next too quickly without a clear explanation. I realize for fans they had to pack in a lot of details which probably added to my confusion.<br/><br/>Music: It would have been nice to hear the glorious theme song earlier in the movie instead of just at the end.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth seeing - not a let down at all.

","The 2009 version of ""Star Trek"" is a ""re-imagined"" prequel to the famed Gene Roddenberry TV series from the 1960s. In this outing, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a hell-raising 23rd Century Iowa farm boy who's tired of living in the shadow of his father, a Starfleet captain who died a hero's death, sacrificing himself to save the lives of his crew (the infant James and his mother included). Yet, after just a single pep talk from one Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), the hotshot Kirk figures it's time to hang up his motorcycle - or the futuristic equivalent thereof - and follow in his hallowed father's footsteps by becoming a member of Starfleet himself.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on the planet Vulcan, a young Spock suffers persecution for being half-human on his mother's side and, thus, opts to sign on to become a commander with the Earth-based Federation rather than serve in the Vulcan Science Academy, as any decent, civic-minded Vulcan with his kind of aptitude is expected to do.<br/><br/>Soon, Kirk and the famously emotionless Spock (Zachary Quinto) are serving together on the maiden voyage of the spanking new Starship Enterprise, along with such familiar faces as Bones (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) in their younger years, with Scotty (Simon Pegg) getting a chance to hop aboard later on. Before they know it, the Enterprise is locked in battle with the Romulans, led by a villain named Nero (Eric Bana), who are trying to make a black hole out of Vulcan, with Earth as their next target.<br/><br/>If none of this sounds particularly familiar even to die-hard Trek fans, it's probably because scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have concocted a time-shifting/alternate-reality version of events that goes against much of what we've previously been told regarding the back story of these characters. One of the benefits of this approach is that it allows Leonard Nimoy to join in on the proceedings, playing Spock as an older incarnation of himself.<br/><br/>The script has some fun parodying Kirk's reputation for one-upmanship and serial womanizing, but a little of that does go a long way. Still, the tension that develops between the cocksure Kirk and the similarly adamant Spock (both well played by Pine and Quinto) is nicely balanced against the camaraderie of two equally skilled professionals working at the peak of their abilities in a common cause.<br/><br/>Special kudos go to director J.J. Abrams for the tremendously exciting action sequences he has created for this film, including one amazing scene atop a giant drill platform located miles above the planet's surface. No surprise, the art direction, production design and special effects are all first-class, and editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon have assembled all the pieces together for maximum impact.<br/><br/>This latest incarnation is good fun for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike."

","This has to probably be the best movie I have ever seen. I wasn't a Trekkie before the movie, however I did grown up with Trekkie parents, so had watched an episode or two of the original series, so I was familiar with the characters and their idiosyncrasies. I wasn't expecting a lot - I've done a lot of drama myself so I'm highly critical of actors. I was expecting this to be just some nerd movie that only pandered to a small group of super fans etc BUT...I was totally blown away. You know a movie is good when you don't expect it to be, but then it is.The casting for all of the actors could not have been better. Personal favourite was Zachary Quinto as Spock - that guy deserves an Oscar. Some people will complain about lens flares and a trigger-happy camera man, but that just added to the bright, futuristic atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought it was great how each actor took part of the nature of each character, but brought themselves to it as well, Chris Pine as Kirk became a little more rebel/bad-boy with an attitude problem, high Top-Gunnish, Zachary Quinto Spock created the perfect tension between his human and Vulcan sides,and even though Eric Bana as Nero had little screen time (he should have had much more) the scenes he was in were perfect, and created a unique and original character (making klingons or something as the bad guys would have been LAME - kudos on choosing Romulans).<br/><br/>Original Series fans will appreciate the introduction of the red suits, ""Im a doctor not a ___!"", the iconic spock-eyebrow-raise, kirk hitting on everything that moves, the origin of the name ""Bones"", and how they found Scotty; and new viewers will find it a fantastic introduction to some of the best characters ever created.<br/><br/>I will be really upset if this doesn't get an Oscar Nomination for best Picture, I believe it should win!"
"movieguysla","10","3","11","5 October 2009"," Re-Engage
","We know what to expect from a ""Star Trek"" movie, thirty plus years after ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". Perhaps this is because the franchise has kept it all in the family up till now. The majority of films have been directed by people involved in the ""Star Trek"" universe for years. The thought of an outsider venturing into the realm of ""Star Trek"" and directing the re-launch of their precious franchise is enough to make a Vulcan's ears straighten out. I mean, the last time an interloper put his stamp on a ""Trek"" adventure, the result was the Stuart Baird-directed ""Star Trek: Nemesis"", considered a failure on all fronts.<br/><br/>So, it's refreshing to see TV guru J.J. Abrams not just succeed, but overwhelmingly so in delivering a fresh, relevant and exciting take on a new ""Trek"" tale. Even more impressive is that ""Transformers"" scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzmann developed an ingenious device to appease long-time Trekkers and newcomers alike. Said device is a black hole that creates an alternate ""Trek"" universe early in the film. This allows the filmmakers to have fun with shades of the ""Trek"" characters we know and love, yet gives them a chance to re-make and re-discover them in a new adventure. It's a great story design and that rare occasion where a time travel story has no glaring flaws. ""Back to the Future II"", a movie that is built on traversing space and time, had a major error in its depiction of time travel* and even another ""Star Trek"" film, ""First Contact"", mishandled time travel*. But if you follow the characters of this movie in and out of wormholes, go home and draw out a schematic diagram of exactly what happened, it make sense! The plot details involve Spock traveling back in time on the heels of Romulans, who are convinced Spock caused the destruction of their home planet. The Romulans are bent on revenge and destroying Vulcan with a mysterious substance called Red Matter. At this point in time, youthful Kirk, Spock, Bones and the rest of the crew are getting their feet wet on the bridge of The Enterprise after the original Captain, Christopher Pike, is captured by the Romulans.<br/><br/>The tech aspects of the movie are top-notch, killing the old notions of cheesy FX that have haunted this franchise in the past. Also top notch is the casting, succeeding in many different ways. Chris Pine as Kirk brings the right machismo and sense of humor to rival straight-as-an-arrow, logic-based Zachary Quinto, nailing the role of Spock. The early-relationship standoffs between Kirk and Spock are a lot of fun, almost playing out like the romantic comedy couple who hate each other that you know will be together in the end. There is romance in this film that wakes Trek fans out of the coma they've been put in by Picard's stodgy relationships (he deserved sexier times). There's a romantic liaison between Spock and Uhuru (a concept straight out of ""alternate universe"") that works as a romance and for comedy fodder as something else to come between Kirk and Spock. Karl Urban has his best role since ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as ""Bones"" McCoy. His role isn't as re-imagined as some of the others, instead, he flavors his role with the best parts of DeForest Kelley's original portrayal, to hilarious effect.<br/><br/>Eric Bana does a fine job as the revenge-bent Romulan, reminding audiences that a real THREAT is essential to an adventure movie. Once the threat is real and potent, a movie can have all sorts of fun underneath that umbrella, and ""Star Trek"" does. Take note, Indiana Jones. In fact, George Lucas, why don't you give J.J. Abrams a call"
"skorpio_60","10","3","11","10 September 2009"," Lots of arguing criticism
","I'm so great fan of SCI FI films & of course STAR TREK is my number one as series, or as films. I believe that after Rondenberry died, other directors & producers have the right to create their concept about the Federation, either in respect of the time sequence & the main philosophy of the original creator, or without them. A nice film is based on an acceptable script, on professional acting, on a respectable budget, etc. Personally I'd accept & be fond of a Star Trek film or series, even not in absolute terms with the sequence, or the philosophy of the original concept, as long as it fulfills the above characteristics. I liked the film even if I keep my reservations too about some scenes, some actions like the one mentioned in others comments saying that in the environment of a Starfleet, no officer would ever drop out of a spaceship a fellow officer just because they had a serious agreement. There are ways to solve even the greater disagreement. But lets not stand on this kind of endless discussions about details or scenes, or time lines... The film was great & the quality also."

","Firstly - I am a fan of Star Trek, and I have been for all my life, having grown up watching all the series' as they appeared on television over the years; so no crying please about how only a ""true fan"" could understand why this film was so awful and probably the reason for world hunger.<br/><br/>I don't fully understand the reviews crying about the fact that the story wasn't cannon, or the characters weren't in it at the right time (note: Chekov), and the set didn't look cheap enough...<br/><br/>What these people are failing to notice is the fact that ... it's an alternate universe - there WILL be differences in what happened, because that is what the entire plot revolves around - maybe, just maybe, Chekov joined Starfleet earlier than he would have in the proper time line, due to Nero messing everything up. Maybe.<br/><br/>Plus there is the fact that Chekov was added in because everyone knows his character, and having characters people like and know is another way to get people interested in the film.<br/><br/>The story wasn't cannon? Aww well that's because it is an alternate time line, like I said - it wouldn't be cannon because of this, therefore; shut up.<br/><br/>The set doesn't look cheap because ... it's not 1966 anymore. Deal with it. There comes a time when all fans have to accept the fact that the original set isn't going to be brought back, because it was cheap looking for a reason, and if a film with said cheap set was ever made in this day and age, it would be laughed out of the cinema.<br/><br/>On to the review.<br/><br/>Star Trek was possibly the best film I have seen this year, surpassing Wolverine Origins ten times over - the plot was an interesting take on the franchise, Zachary Quinto was absolutely brilliant as Spock, as were Chris Pine and Zoe Saldana as Kirk and Uhura. The addition of Lenoard Nemoy just made it that much better.<br/><br/>The set was incredibly ""futuristic"", thus giving the Enterprise a new, modern lease of life. The inclusion as Simon Pegg as Scotty was a brilliant choice because he brought his own charm to the role, as well as keeping to the norm people would expect.<br/><br/>I would enjoy another Star Trek film with the same characters and actors (maybe even a television series? Please? :) ), purely because this fulfilled my expectations and can only get better from here.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing."

To those of you who're not into Star Trek, you will be after you see this. And for those like me who casually like Star Trek, it'll make you want watch the old TV series and the movies. Great job JJ Abrams! I had a feeling that JJ Abrams would do a good job because he seems to have the ""midas touch"" when it comes to his work. Look at his resume': Alias, Lost, Fringe, Cloverfield, Felicity, Mission Impossible 3, Joy Ride, Armageddon, Forever Young, and even Regarding Henry! This guy has a great imagination. The coolest thing was seeing how the classic characters evolved. We always saw the interesting relationships between the characters on the TV show but we'd only knew a little of the backstory. It was almost like watching the Star Wars prequels with James T. Kirk like Anakin Skywalker."
"Chris Knipp","7","3","11","12 May 2009"," Spunk meets Spock
","What do you do with a franchise that has been milked dry? You stage a prequel, or, in other words, a childhood-and-youth-of-the-hero movie. J.J. Abrams' aim in this simply-titled entry is to show how James Kirk and Mr. Spock got to be running the spaceship Enterprise. The non-Trekkie must approach with trepidation this dramatic effort to freshen up the hallowed TV series and its not-so-successful movie avatars. Is it enough to say it's beautiful and entertaining, but lacks something? What happens is a big battle to trounce an evil guy who's destroying whole planets, and some background on the young Spock and Kirk. The substance is simple: Spock's logical, alright, but he's also deeply emotional. Kirk's a testosterone-soaked bad boy, but he's got just the balance of smarts and derring-do to be a great leader.<br/><br/>Beyond that, this 'Star Trek' reboot is a dazzlingly pretty audio-visual experience, maybe the closest a lot of moviegoers will ever come to abstract art. It's geometric abstraction: though we're whirling around the galaxies, mostly what we see is space ships with their angles and curves. The early sequences are well balanced and fun, despite an opening that follows the typical but inexplicable blockbuster theory that you should hit 'em with all you've got in the first ten minutes. This 25-years-older flashback showing how daddy Kirk was captain of the Enterprise for a few minutes and saved 800 people while his wife was giving birth on board to the future James Kirk, is ridiculously loud and impulsive and confusing, and when it is clear, it seems corny as all heck. Anyway, mile-a-minute openings' may grab the viewer, but you can never keep up to that level. The only reliable result is that you've numbed the audience.<br/><br/>The next scene, a nice contrast because it's back down on the flattest of earth surfaces, shows a pre-teen Jim junior--miraculously, since it's the 23rd century: where'd he get the fossil fuel?--racing a stolen Corvette across the desert a few lengths in front of a motorcycle cop, jumping out just before the 'vette pitches over a cliff and hanging there--a time-worn dramatic device that will be repeated again more than once. This tow-head smart-aleck is an annoying little cuss, but he's certainly got balls far beyond his years. He's ready to ""boldly go."" I have never watched a whole 'Star Trek' original episode, and if I've glimpsed any of the ten-odd movie spin-offs, I've forgotten. I can believe, however, that this is both one of the better ones--and missing certain essential elements in the interpretation of the original characters and in the way ""issues"" are brought up in the series as originally conceived. The only ""issues"" seemed to be to stop a bad guy bent on destroying the galaxy, and the conflict between the cold logic of Zachary Quinto's Spock and the obnoxious spunk (but creative initiative) of Chris Pine's Jim Kirk. The young Kirk, more or less the star, played by Chris Pine, is a bad-boy cutie. His pretty face is always bruised and scarred from a brawl, or maybe it's acne. Pine's Kirk bursts with boyish energy that's hard to resist. What's not so easy is to imagine how such an obstreperous twerp would be allowed on board the space ship, let alone be rapidly moved to a leadership position in the highly regimented, not to say repressive and fascistic, intergalactic system.<br/><br/>It's also not quite clear how a nerdy character like the half-Klingon Spock would be so highly regarded, if Kirk's kind of, well, enterprise, were deeply valued. Are they just two sides of one person, maybe? But mostly there's so much action going on in 'Star Trek' that it's not important to ponder such questions. It primarily just gorgeous special effects.<br/><br/>There are some appealing secondary characters (not as much multi-galactic social color as in 'Star Wars,' though, by a long sight). Simon Pegg the English actor plays Scotty with a real Scottish brogue and a peppy comical manner. Anton Yelchin who is really a young Russian-born actor but grew up here and speaks perfect English, does a funny but accurate Russian accent as the 17-year-old navigator, Chekhov. John Cho, who plays the Asian crew member Hikaru Sulu, is the quite amusing guy who plays Harold in the 'Harold and Kumar' comedies, but he's not very amusing here. I was surprised to see Winona Rider was in the cast. I thought she might have been the green floozy, but she turns out to have played Spock's human mother. I know nothing about the guy who plays the young Spock. He is not interesting. But Leonard Nimoy himself, the original Spock, is on hand to play the old Spock, who returns from the future to help out. That is a lovely touch, though the writers have to get tangled up in a time warp to stage it.<br/><br/>Eric Bana as the evil leader Nero is fine, if you don't mind that all his cohorts look pretty much identical to him--all swarthy, shaven-headed, tattooed leathermen. The contrast with the bright-eyed dazzlingly-lit world of the Enterprise reminds me of the Drapes and Squares of my high school, or the Greasers and Soscs of S.E. Hinton's 'The Outsiders.' How is it that the proper good-boy spaceships are by NASA out of Mies van der Rohe, while Nero's are like rough-hewn medieval sculpted weapons? You kind of have to like the originality of the Nero vessels, but they don't look very aerodynamic.<br/><br/>It seems to be the rule now that when a blockbuster is half decent, the flacks rush in with raves when it's barely out of the can. I'd side more with Anthony Lane (""This new 'Star Trek' is nonsense, no question. . .but at least it's not boggy nonsense"" or Roger Ebert (""you want space opera, you got it"")."
"teda0311","10","3","11","11 May 2009"," Characters are AWESOME
","I would go so far to say that this movie is more about good strong characters than any previous Star Trek.<br/><br/>Chris Pine (portraying Kirk as a hooligan ready to fight anyone anytime) is outstanding as everyone else. I do have a mild prejudice on my part against Harold and Kumar go to Star Trek. The new Scotty will make you forget he used to kill zombies and the new Uhurah will make you drool. The new Spock is the best character improvement and Spock was my favorite character in the original. Long live and prosper Spock! The story was a little weak, but even a weak story with such good characters can thrive. I would see it again and hope it goes where no movie has every gone before."
"chi-cerca-trova","9","3","11","11 May 2009"," A Brilliant Film
","I must preface any statement I make about this film with the following disclaimer: I never followed Star Trek. To be honest, I've only seen Nemesis. So, my approach to this movie is from the standpoint of a film rather than an addition to the Star Trek cannon.<br/><br/>Having said that, I thought this was an amazing film. It grabs you in the first 10 minutes and does not let go. The special effects, the story, the acting all came together to create a wonderful film. JJ Abrams was able to do what few directors can: Balance the epic nature of the film with a gripping character study. Too many times the basic human story involved is lost in an orgy of CGI. While CGI made up a substantial chunk of this film, JJ Abrams never lost sight of what makes a story great.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it, from a cinephile's point of view. A great way to start of the summer movie season, Star Trek will not disappoint."
"d_art","9","3","11","11 May 2009"," Movie Thoughts: The New Star Trek
","And so, I watched the new Star Trek flick directed by JJ Abrams on Friday morning for $6 (since it was before noon at AMC) with some buddies. It was massively entertaining and I liked it just like everybody else who came with me, although I did have one major nitpick about it (although those who see it will probably know exactly what I mean... but I understand fully why they did that). Definitely, worth watching again. The casting and the acting was excellent. I loved the little fanboy elements, small little details that elevated my appreciation of it, and the visuals are colorful, optimistic, while being mature in its execution. Despite the fact that I was more on the Star Wars side of the Trekkie-Jedi spectrum (at least before the prequels), I did love the old Star Trek series. Cool thing about Star Trek was that although they explored new worlds ""physically,"" in reality it was more of an inner journey that was projected as physical manifestations (just like the great Twilight Zone series), which made you think a little bit more. It also made the cheesy f/x charming, because those things became irrelevant. And, Captain Kirk, what a character! Spock, what a square! (in a good way) Mc Coy was a like a grumpy, emotional grandma, but a ton of fun! Admittedly, much of the movies that came out of it were more about the dogfights than exploring, however. Despite the fact that people do make fun of the first motion picture, I appreciated it simply for the fact that they actually tried to ""seek out new civilizations."" <br/><br/>Yes, going back to the movie at hand. I loved the fact they got an unknown and not Matt Damon as Captain Kirk. Yea, Matt Damon might as well have been a great choice... but it would just be Matt Damon playing himself. His personality in movies are already too much like Captain Kirk. He's too likable, gets the chicks, and can beat up everybody. I'm sure no one minded Pierce Brosnan becoming James Bond in Goldeneye or Jack Nicholson become the Joker in Bat Man as they were already ""perfect"" for that role, but seeing Heath ""Brokeback Mountain"" Ledger becoming the Joker? Unheard of! Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the first X-men? Hugh who? A blonde Daniel Craig as Bond? What? Just to clarify, these untested unknowns have now ""become"" these beloved characters to the fanboys. Simply put, these actors had to ""try harder"" to get over all the hoops and suspicions of the audience and wound up with something better, more original, and daring. While Chris Pine as Kirk wasn't some great breakthrough role, I appreciated the fact that he wound up as far from being any parody or a caricature (Let's face it--how can you NOT make a caricature of Captain Kirk? Everybody....else and...their grandmother....has). True, Karl Urban, being spot-on perfect as Mc Coy ALMOST treaded the line toward caricature, but he was so excellent at it, it was a tear-jerking homage more than anything. Zachary ""Sylar"" Quinto as Spock--he brought dimension to what could've otherwise have been a flat character in the wrong hands. I generally dislike most portrayals of Vulcans in Star Trek--Leonard Nimoy as Spock was probably the only Vulcan that I liked. I LIKED Sylar's Spock. There was actual inner struggle in this version of Spock, which can be both good and bad, but it makes sense...I'll merely say: ""Facinating."" Anton Yelchin's Russian accent as Chekov, however...well.... I didn't mind. Wasn't Chekov already kind of like a stereotype? Haha. I dunno. I still liked him. Hey, it was the Cold War back then--having a Russian in a USS starfleet was quite an accomplishment in itself. There were also small and major details I did love. One was a scene where Spock beams down on a planet while crouching. This kind of detail made perfect sense especially assuming that most planetary (or rocky) surfaces are usually not level. Another great treat, a major one, was that there was actually a scene where James Kirk takes the Kobayashi Maru test, which was mentioned before (or would that be late?) in the best (and still best) film of the series, Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan.<br/><br/>Admittedly, much like the other movies of the series, the new Star Trek film doesn't ""seek out new civilizations"" either. However, given the fact that it's more about the introduction of the characters and their quirks and what they're capable of and how they came to be where they are, I can let that fact go (for now). It may simply be better that they ""seek out"" in the next movie instead (which hopefully won't be about dogfights but actual exploration). It's sometimes just hard to fit everything in. Even movies like Spider-Man and Batman Begins, where the main character goes through a journey from ordinary to extraordinary, one wonders if it's so important to have a major baddie in the first film given that the bad guy will always lose screen time to the main guy. In the case of this movie, where there are lots of main characters, this discrepancy may be quite noticeable, even though I think Eric Bana as the Romulan baddie Nero handled it perfectly well and I have no real complaints on that regard. After all, thanks to time travel (one of the central parts of my aforementioned nitpick), the bad guy appears to the good guys ready-made and angry, ready for consumption (to become cannon fodder) like an instant TV dinner. I wonder if they have a ""bad-guy replicator"" in the future? Nitpicks aside, the action is aplenty, the special effects are excellent, the characters are lovable, and you want to see them win (a good sign) and well, what do you expect? Overall, a very good film: 9/10."

"MaxBorg89","9","3","11","10 May 2009"," Here's to the new generation!
","As far as reboots go, the new Star Trek picture was always going to be a tough one to pull off, and not just because of the famous ""odd-numbered curse"" (this being, technically speaking, the eleventh Trek movie): unlike other recently regenerated franchises like Batman or James Bond, Gene Roddenberry's creation is burdened with a somewhat cheesy reputation, mostly due to William Shatner's iconic line delivery (very... long... dramatic pauses) and fans (or Trekkers, as they call themselves) who have a habit of trying to learn the Klingon language. It is therefore understandable that Paramount handed the damaged franchise (the previous film, Star Trek: Nemesis, while not being the worst of the lot, was the least successful commercially) to a non-fan: J.J. Abrams, whose untarnished TV record (Alias and Lost) and previous successful ""redemption operation"" (Mission: Impossible III) make him an ideal candidate for bringing Star Trek to a new, disillusioned generation of viewers. And boy, does he deliver...<br/><br/>Kicking off with a huge space battle, Abrams' prequel/reboot then proceeds to show us the difficult upbringing of the original show's leading duo: James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), a hot-headed, womanizing rebel whose father was killed in the aforementioned battle, and Spock (Zachary Quinto), the Vulcan scientist who has to deal with the ""shame"" of having a human mother (Winona Ryder). The two meet (and clash) at Starfleet Academy, and later find themselves on the U.S.S. Enterprise alongside ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) and Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Their mission: to prevent the vengeful Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan who has come from the future, to carry out his evil plan.<br/><br/>A simple story on paper, but with a few surprises along the way: that's what Abrams and his screenwriters, self-confessed Trek aficionados Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, offer the audience over the course of 126 minutes. There's humor, action, suspense, romance (though not the one suggested in pre-release rumors), some technobabble (this is Star Trek, after all): in short, a fun, exciting ride that will please old and new fans alike. For the latter category, there's the classic good story well told, decorated with some nice explosions, space travel at incredible speed (one really gets the feeling of traveling faster than light) and a few bona fide fights (not to mention a tormented protagonist who's more Luke Skywalker than William Shatner); for the die-hard Trekkers, there are the characters who retain their original characteristics while inheriting some new traits from the actors playing them (best of the lot are Quinto's Spock, Urban's McCoy and Simon Pegg's Scotty), a villain worth comparing to Khan and knowing references to the original series, which range from deliberate tributes (the classic theme music and ""final frontier"" monologue, the late Majel Barrett - that would be Roddenberry's widow - voicing the Enterprise's computer) to clever, and occasionally ironic, in-jokes (how McCoy got his nickname, the Kobayashi Maru test, Sulu's passion for fencing).<br/><br/>Still, this isn't just a prequel story, it's also a reboot, meaning Abrams must have some trick up his sleeve that will allow him to take the story in a new direction come sequel(s) time. He does, and it's a brilliant idea he and the writers have come up with: through his time-trotting actions, Nero has permanently altered the Trek reality we knew and erased the events of at least ten episodes (including the original rejected pilot The Cage, whose lead character Christopher Pike has an important role in the film), which means encyclopedic knowledge of TOS is no longer a prerequisite for future installments.<br/><br/>But angered Trekkers needn't worry: there's still a vital, unbreakable link with the original show, namely Leonard Nimoy, who takes advantage of the time travel gimmick to play the ""real"" Spock once again and truly pass the torch to the new cast, acting as a bridge between the two separate continuities and ensuring the old Trek universe will never die, despite what the destruction of a '60s car early into the film might symbolically suggest. Some will probably claim The Wrath of Khan remains the best entry in the franchise, but it is undeniable that thanks to Abrams and his ""partners in crime"", Roddenberry's creation really gets to go where no Star Trek film has gone before. May the new version live long, and prosper"
"Mr-Linus","10","3","11","10 May 2009"," One of the best ""popcorn"" movies out there!
","Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Doesn't matter if you didn't see Star Trek before, or even think it's cheesy.<br/><br/>Personally, I probably seen 10 minutes of all Star Trek before this movie, and thought that it was incredibly cheesy and stupid. (I know, shame on me). And, the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place is because of Mr. Abrams - I loved his previous projects.<br/><br/>And yet... this movie blew me away. J.J. Abrams and his crew made sure that the movie would be enjoyable for EVERYONE. The 126 minutes run-time felt like 10 minutes at most - the film is paced incredibly well. There's not one boring moment.<br/><br/>The excellent cast helps too. I was most impressed by Chris Pine, who was simply excellent for the role of Kirk.<br/><br/>Overall, just go see this movie. I could go on and on about how great the CGI was, how well done the dialog was (has to be Orci's and Kurtzman's best work yet) and how fitting the music was (Michael Giacchino)... but the truth is, you just have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Live long and prosper."
"digginglife66-1","10","3","11","9 May 2009"," Sheer AWESOMENESS
","I should start off by quoting a fellow movie goer at the end of this film. ""Dude, you just missed the best movie ever."" And to date, it is.<br/><br/>Star Trek was a fantastic rendition of a familiar legendary series with many a devoted fan, and few will be disappointed. I was not among them.<br/><br/>There are very few complaints I have about the movie, so I wish to get them out of the way first. Number one is the music, I was not sold on it. I liked the ending when they brought back the original tune from the regular Star Trek with no attempts to jazz it up or to alter it. Second, Zachary Quinto, I was not fully confident in his ability to portray Spock, he wasn't a complete failure, but I believe that his ability to further portray the character will show itself in a sequel. We'll see then.<br/><br/>I cannot say that there is a perfect movie, because no movie is perfect, however it doesn't get better than this. The acting was superb, the casting was nearly pitch perfect, the action breathtaking, and it leaves you feeling good and fulfilled. When I see a movie I want to leave feeling good about the experience, so does everyone else, and this has done it. I laughed, I cried, I fidgeted during times of stress on the characters, it was a fun experience.<br/><br/>I have to say my favorite parts of this movie are those involving the first ever Spock, Mr. Leonard Nimoy. He has the ability to command the screen with quiet confidence that few actors will ever accomplish, he is indeed commendable.<br/><br/>Please see this movie; fan or no. It satisfies the hunger for something better than an average film."
"vorlon42","7","3","11","9 May 2009"," Not bad
","Not a bad Star Trek movie. Not a bad film. Perhaps the best of the ""odd numbered"" Treks. Far better than the last ""even numbered."" The acting was good. The characterization superb. The special effects were well executed and not distracting or over the top. It was certainly entertaining. The plot was a little unnecessarily convoluted. Apparently reading some prequel comic makes it clearer. But, for me, the film's major downfall was an overabundance of smarmy meta-textual in-jokes that hampered the pacing of the film combined with some glaring logic errors. Some of them are quite clever, but they're a little to frequent and seem a little to ""oh look how clever I am!"" They don't ruin the film, just hold it back a little."

Sometimes you aren't even sure what's happening on-screen...but you are sure that you like it.<br/><br/>Spock's mother, played by Sandra Bullock, is probably the most touching character in the movie. Also the make-up they used on Zachary Qaonto to make him appear old for the scene in the ice cave was terrific.<br/><br/>If you like The Fast and The Furious films, then you will love this. If you liked all the old Star Trek films even though they didn't have good effects, you will love this.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would have to say that the sequel is strong in this one. May the Federation be with you."

","This is quite possibly the best 'reboot' a franchise has ever gotten. I hadn't watched anything Star Trek in so long that I'd forgotten how much I loved the universe and the characters in it, and this movie definitely reminded me. The dialogue is wonderful, the acting is right where it needs to be, and the direction was another hit out of the park by JJ. I literally have no complaints. It's both an action AND story packed 2 hours that is so massive and enthralling it left my head spinning (and a movie hasn't done that to me in years). <br/><br/>Even if you're not a Trekkie, GO SEE IT. This could very well change your mind."
"Neopaulitan","10","3","11","9 May 2009"," A Much-Needed Reboot to a Beloved Series
","I've been a fan of Star Trek for about 22 years now, ever since I'd seen STIV:TVH. I merely liked the movies and classic episodes I'd seen up until then; with STIV, I became intellectually engaged and began to catch repeats of classic episodes whenever they came on.<br/><br/>I remained an avid fan through TNG and I liked DS9 quite a bit. I fell away from my fervor after the first season of VOY. Not that it wasn't likable, but grown-up life had come to need more of my attention, and there seemed to be too much Trek for me to keep up with. I did watch the movies as they came out, and caught a few early episodes of ENT.<br/><br/>Having said that, I don't understand the negative reaction I've seen from fans here. Some here seem to think that this movie invalidates everything we saw in the in the episodes and movies. I can't believe die-hard Trekkies (or Trekkers, if you prefer--the distinction is lost on me) are unable to grasp the concept of alternate time-lines. Everything that we saw happen in Universe Prime (which is what I guess we're to call the original universe, since Leonard Nimoy's character is Spock Prime) still happened in that time-line; a new time-line was created with Nero's time-travel. Alternate time-lines/universes/earths have been a staple of Star Trek since the original series (see ""Mirror, Mirror"", ""Bread and Circuses"", and ""Miri"" for examples).<br/><br/>Others have complained about this Star Trek not having a soul. Maybe this is because it didn't veer into the preachiness that previous installations indulged in. I have to ask, is there anything left to preach? Trekkies have already heard Trek's message. In this new movie, the message is there, but it's transmitted more through the actions than the words: In Spock's withdrawn petition to the Vulcan Academy of Sciences due to the racist attitudes of its board, in the replete examples we see of different races working together, and in the challenge by Pike to Kirk to become something better than he was.<br/><br/>The destruction of Vulcan and the death of Amanda Grayson were both shocking and heart-wrenching, but they also sent a clear message: this new Trek is not safe. Unexpected things are likely to occur. This in itself is a much-needed transfusion for the Trek franchise; as one of it's producers recently noted, ""Star Trek choked on its own continuity."" Now that the Universe Prime continuity has been ""archived,"" it will be exciting to see where the franchise goes next.<br/><br/>I loved the cast. Pine's Kirk was brash and reckless, exactly what one would expect of him. Quinto's Spock was incredible, and Karl Urban nailed the attitudes and cadences of Dr. McCoy. I wish we'd seen more of Sulu and Chekov, but I understand the limitations of a two-hour movie, and I'm sure they'll be developed more in the sequels. Overall, a truly great film that sets the stage for telling bolder Star Trek stories than have ever been told before."
"Medacakathareal","8","3","11","9 May 2009"," Lighthearted thrillride. An excellent reboot
","Last night I sat down to indulge in JJ Abrams take on Gene Roddenberry's classic series and I must say I wasn't disappointed. It seems the critics might be right for once as Abrams delivers a fun fast-paced movie that is filled with witty quips and funny moments and yet maintains emotional depth.<br/><br/>The cast is young which makes it all the more surprising they did so well, every cast member, even the oft mediocre Karl Urban, does well in their role. This film will go from making you laugh to having you on the edge of your seat in a millisecond.<br/><br/>The only weak link in the acting chain is Eric Bana, I've got nothing against him personally, but every movie I've seen him in he has been unequivocally awful and this film is no exception. He plays a vengeful Romulon from the future and the main villain of the film and I really found myself wishing Abrams had cast someone else.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty solid, it has found an interesting balance between comedy and action that it somehow manages to maintain. The only plot complaint is the unnecessary inclusion of Time Travel, which leads to an unnecessary, albeit welcome, cameo from old Spock (Nimoy). Spock essentially becomes Captain Exposistion and goes around explaining things and it does seem a bit silly...<br/><br/>So the film is not without its flaws, but it makes up for them and becomes the first truly good Summer Blockbuster in 2009. So whether you're a trekkie from way back or someone who's just hearing of the franchise now, go see Star Trek."
"helmutty","7","3","11","9 May 2009"," Not a fan of Star Trek.
","I have not even watch any of the Star Trek movies, not the 2003 movie. But it is J.J Abrams that makes me interested in the reboot/remake. His previous movie, Mission Impossible 3, is good and is the best of the trilogy. His latest effort, Star Trek, is not bad either. There is drama, there is fast-paced action and there is amazing special effects. J.J Abrams is famous for producing TV series, Lost, and the shaky Cloverfield.<br/><br/>The story: The origin of Star Trek. It reaches out to everyone whether fan or not. Reboots/remakes are usually different from the original, this is something people need to accept while watching them in order to enjoy or like them. There are many successful reboots like Batman, Hulk and now Star Trek. J.J Abrams makes movies that are not too long or not too short. They usually clock around 2 hours, not more or not less. That is why, his movies are entertaining. His movies do not make you feel that they are dragged or being cut short. Now the story goes at a fast pace. Especially for those who are watching Star Trek for the first time. There is enough suspense and when it comes to action, it is purely intensity. The action scenes are breath-taking, fast-paced and are moving in a frenetic way. The music is epic too.<br/><br/>Overall: Yeah, I don't know whether it is a good reboot but it is definitely a good adventure movie and worth the watch. Those interested in the origin of the Star Trek should catch. J.J Abrams' fans should catch this too. Star Trek's fans will catch this one. If there is a sequel, it should be up in my must-watch movies."

Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Ben Cross, Winona Ryder SynopsisA distress call from the planet of Vulcan sends Starfleet into action as the newly launched USS Enterprise lead by Captain Pike (Greenwood) attempt to head off a Romulan menace (Bana) hell-bent on destroying the United Federation of Planetsplanet by planet.<br/><br/>ThoughtsProducer / Director J.J. Abrams (producer of Lost, Fringe, Alias and Cloverfield) was given the unenviable task of bringing the Star Trek brand back to the big screen. Nothing could be a harder, more daunting task than trying to please a roomful of Trek fans while attempting to draw a new generation into the fold. But Abrams was a wise choice will the success of the great Lost series (and the up and coming Fringe), Abrams has established a knack for cerebral science fiction like few have in the last decade or more. With the new Star Trek adventure Abrams and his technical crew have managed to pull off a story that is a sequel and a prequel not to mention a relaunch of the long running series that can now even break new territory while being respectful of the classic voyages of yesterday. I think even the late Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry would be impressed. The smart storyline evolves in such a way that they managed to pull off and bring in Leonard Nimoy for one last appearance as the pointy-eared, neck-pincher Spock (still my favorite Trek universe character). Now came the hard part. The job to assign new faces to the roles of the original series must have been amazingly tough and for the most part the producers pull it off surprisingly well. The holy trinity of Kirk, Spock and McCoy (the heart of the series) could have easily sent the project down in flames quickly but Chris Pine (Just My Luck, Smokin' Aces) manages to channel the cockiness and spirit of William Shatner's Kirk while taking the role and making it his own. Zachary Quinto certainly pulls off Spock's look and mannerisms even though he is a bit off sounding like him (Nimoy, who has done narration for many projects in the past has an unmistakable voice) but for me Karl Urban (with many genre projects already under his belt such as The Lord of the Rings) did old Bones so convincingly that it gave me flashbacks and a huge smile. With the main trio locked down next came the second tier characters the new Scotty (Pegg of Shaun of the Dead and Spaced) is spot-on and as funny as ever. Zoe Saldana (Guess Who, The Terminal) makes the role of communications officer Uhura her own and is uber-sexy doing it too. John Cho (of Harold and Kumar fame) and Anton Yelchin (Terminator: Salvation, Alpha Dog) round out the cast as Sulu and Chekov, Cho certainly looked the part but again he wasn't able to give his Sulu the unmistakable George Takai voice. Chekov was for me the only sore spot in the casting. Yelchin just didn't do it for me. He didn't look like Walter Koenig at all and his accent was horrible. While the production design was excellent minor things cropped up here and there. The CGI was plentiful and over-powering and ranged from the awe-inspiring to the ho-hum. Was the green cadet chick Kirk was macking a CGI effect. Either way it looked terrible. To round out the Trekker nit-picking, the music soundtrack was lacking. Even though the use of the original show's theme was excellent it lacked the memorable presence of the Jerry Goldsmith years.<br/><br/>In ConclusionMinor quibbles (or is that Tribbles?) aside the new Star Trek has more-than-enough to please many of the most hardened of fans (my Mother even loved it). The end product is admirable and easily accessible by those new to the series and just a fun romp through the universe. They plotted the correct course and warp speed ahead."
"Dragonsouls","9","3","11","9 May 2009"," Old fashioned fan who loved it !
","Now let me first introduce myself since I find it necessary to let other Trekkies know that I am a huge Sci-fi fan, and always regarded Trek as the best of all franchises. Besides a few seasons of DS9, I've watched each and every episode of all the other series, as well as reading five Star Trek novels and watching each film dozens of times.<br/><br/>This film was a treat, and the best birthday gift I have ever had. I will go into detail as I continue to write this review, but will start off by summarizing it in a few words- SATISFYING and EPIC in scale! Besides some flawed editing and pacing, the direction was tight and JJ is indeed the new Spielberg of our time, or at least will eventually become.<br/><br/>Kudos to the writers for sticking to the Star Trek formula. I had to really watch this film twice to appreciate it. After the denial ended after my first trip to the theaters, I realized how easily producers could have messed this film up and they didn't. It's not easy re-booting Star Trek, the last time it happened, we had Roddenberry supervising TNG and DS9. Enterprise wasn't really a re-boot, just an alternate universe so it doesn't count as a re-boot.<br/><br/>Star Trek by JJ Abrahms is a re-boot!! Trust me when I tell you. The acting sometimes made me feel as if I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit because of all the Nostalgia but I still laughed and even choked up a bit in some scenes. If anything was missing, it was a bit of the old Trek's ways to make a point about things, and this film wasn't the most philosophical Trek film. However, the plot was very good which involved a re-booting of the entire time-line that I found no problem with. I was perplexed as to why Old Spock would break the prime directive since I don't think he would do that in his prime.<br/><br/>The Special Effects were stunning! Nothing groundbreaking, but just lots of it, and on par or better than Battle Star Galactica's effects also by the great ILM company. I was miffed about some little things, like the effects of beaming and warp speed causing a haze around the Enterprise. Speaking of the Enterprise, she wasn't treated with proper respect in this film, maybe we get a director's cut soon? I would like to see scenes from the first trailer, when she is being built.<br/><br/>I give this film a 9/10 because it's not my favorite Trek film. I am too old fashioned to put this #1 after just two viewings. But its' up there because of the good writing and performances by all of the cast. I hope the next film will be less of an intro film and more of the Hard Core Trek! Finally, Leonard Nimoy in his cameo role. What a treat!! I was rubbing my eyes and pinching myself, numb with emotion. The Vulcans were really introduced to the world in this film, and it's what propelled this film for me. One of the Best Trek films ever for sure!"

","First off for those that gave the movie a bad rating shame on you. First off with the next generation crew anyone who has seen Nemesis knows why it could never happen again. Gene is dead, someone took over his vision and ran with it. Yes it wasn't the absolutely the best it perhaps could have been but it was a tremendous movie. I have been a Trekkie a long time and thought it was a great direction they went with the new movie. It helped breath life back into Star Trek...Besides honestly sure it would have been great if they did the same old stuff by just redoing the original stuff all over. At least with the way this has played out it opens so many new opportunities."

For people who aren't original Star Trek fans, this movie has good character development, an interesting storyline, and plenty of fun action - as well as a lot more comedy than I expected, and left all of us smiling at the end. For Star Trek fans (the 3 of you that haven't rushed out and already seen it) - you will enjoy the way it modifies the storyline without destroying the original, and how they included young versions of every memorable crew character from the series.<br/><br/>Chris Pine (I almost typed Pike!) was excellent as the new Kirk and played the role with the right personality, and they set up Spock and Bones in a way that can easily tie in with their 'future' counterparts. Comedic relief was provided by the other characters, and it was fun to see young versions of them (though non-trekkies missed out on a couple 'inside jokes').<br/><br/>The theater was full of people of all ages and walks of life, and the trekkie I saw the movie with thinks it will crate a whole new generation of Star Trek fans.

That size ship should not have bin able to carry more than 15 shuttles."

","Okay, overall the JJ Abrams reboot of the Star Trek franchise with his film Star Trek is a fine action-adventure space movie but I'd put it below Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, and possibly below Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and maybe even Star Trek: First Contact simply in terms of entertainment value and a tight story.<br/><br/>Star Trek 2009 has a lot going for it, mainly excellent casting with a couple of exceptions. I would have much preferred Gabrielle Union in the role of Uhuru, and Karl Urban as Spock (although his McCoy is excellent). Zachary Quinto turns in fine work, but I just don't think he was right for the part. Chris Pine deserves the big Steve McQueen-type stardom he will now get (hopefully he will choose his roles well), and even Simon Pegg as Scotty worked somehow.<br/><br/>The biggest mistake of all was the de-alienization of Spock. Go back and watch Star Trek: The Motion Picture and see how Nimoy plays Spock as almost wholly alien, with that cool black wardrobe and very very different from humans. That is the cool Spock which made the character an icon, not the Oprahized touchy feely sexpot Spock we got in this film. Using Nimoy served the time-travel device but they didn't need him in more than one scene - and how can the two Spocks be in one universe??? Gah, Old Spock telling Quinto Spock ""Good Luck,"" (sigh) The best Spock in the whole movie is the little kid Spock - good little actor and he owned the part.<br/><br/>All over the web you can read glowing reviews about what they got right - the visceral action, the fast pacing, and a story that hangs together, but the film was not without its problems.<br/><br/>The time-travel device is always iffy or weak as a way to tell a story and it only worked halfway in this instance because although they tried to follow the Wrath of Khan revenge arc with their story, their villain was too plain, from too humble a background to really bring gravitas to him or his quest. The love affair between Spock and Uhura was a misfire 100%. Unfolding events kept putting the characters we knew into the chairs we were used to seeing them occupy but it felt forced, not the result of an altered time-stream which would have been interesting (that you can alter time, but not really) Kirk was the by far the most fully realized character and the most believable, but the sheer disregard the characters had for chain-of-command and regulations was breathtaking. The original series was grounded in a rock-solid command hierarchy and unflinching attention to procedure and regulations and it created drama when the characters went outside of them and created a foundation upon which the story rested (a military crew on a mission) but in Star Trek 2009 the characters just seemed to make up rules as they went along and mixed and matched them.<br/><br/>By rebooting the story with the altered time-line we get an instant mix of character relationships, not the backstory we know where people had a track record and had worked together already for years or at least knew of each others' talents and exploits. The original Kirk carefully hand-picked his command team because he knew of their talents, this crew just was tossed in a blender and ended up in the right chairs.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but toward the end of the film with Nero and his giant claw ship becoming the focus of the finale, it visually reminded me way too much of the worst Star Trek film, Nemesis - another mad Romulan out for vengeance against the captain of the Enterprise. Oh, and don't get me started on Red Matter (or as I call it, One-Glob Singularity-forming Lava Lamp) - now that was a cheap plot device.<br/><br/>The other main criticism is that this film fell too much in the gritty in what I call the Sleek vs. Gritty approach to science fiction aesthetics (read my post about it on Galactica Variants here: http://galacticavariants.blogspot.com/2009/01/sleek-vs-gritty.html ) What made the original Star Trek so cool was the sleek, minimalist look to the design - which had a functional quality to it. Frankly some of the sets looked cheap. Pool light covers for transporter pads and weird plastic cutouts for the above transporter sections for example. <br/><br/>Abrams should bring back the iconic sounds, and no more shots of breweries and basements substituting as the engineering section, that was a travesty. Just one or two shuttles next time, not the whole lower half of the ship for a giant hangar bay.and more color and atomization in the transporter effect, but the horizontal lines were okay. Bring back beam phasers, the pulse gun type sucked. Slowly alter the look of the interior closer to the original series' look - far too many graphic interface panels and consoles and thingies that stick up. No more Star Fleet Academy - you've done it, never need to see it again (it was done best in Wrath of Khan). Sick Bay - it looked like a modern dentist's office - return closer to the look of the original series (minimalism, get it?). Bring back phasers as lasting beams of light (enough with the staccato-fast effect) and bring back that cool blue and the cool sound (gads, this one is so obvious). And - please - no more aliens (except as featured guest stars or way-in-the-background-and-blurry extras) and get rid of the little munchkin Scotty sidekick rock alien (I was flashing back, in a bad way, to Ewoks)"

","I too, like most people, are not an avid fan, though I am married to one. I have sat through the best and the worst that the Star Trek franchise has to offer and I was absolutely overwhelmed with this movie.<br/><br/>There was no conceivable way that the set designers and technicians were going to transport this modern day concept back to the 1960's. We are far removed from the days when the doors were opened by people hiding in the wings. And yet, I felt that it was simply not overdone. Whereas the original series tended to gloss over most of the more technical parts eg ships entering the cargo bays etc, this picture took it further and let us have a good look at how the ship worked while still tipping its hat to the original shapes and feel of the ship.<br/><br/>Uhura still looks silly with her earpiece sticking out of her ear but it was right to leave it in. Same as the phasers etc. These were the areas where the defunct Enterprise series let it down. It tried to be too clever and failed.<br/><br/>While the plot is not fantastic, it does allow JJ Abrahms plenty of leeway to play with the time line. Everything that die hard Trekkies can stand up and argue about, has been covered neatly and explained.<br/><br/>Sitting with my husband on the way home, we found ourselves trying to make sense of the brave new world out there for the new crew of the Enterprise. And a brave new world it shall be, as every movie from this point forward, no longer exists in the new universe.<br/><br/>I now look forward to seeing what the writers come up with...oh, and please leave Chris Pine in as Captain Kirk...after all, he is much better eye candy than William Shatner ever was!"
"davidmvining","7","2","6","22 November 2019"," A fun adventure.
","There's an interesting divide between Star Trek fans about J.J. Abrams' reboot of the franchise. I see it as those who view the franchise as science fiction and those that view it as techno-fantasy.<br/><br/>In my mind, Star Trek has never been science fiction. It's a fantasy world with switches and starships instead of wizards and dragons. They've made up the ""science"" from the beginning. Transporters? Fantasy. Warp speed? Fantasy. Phasers? Fantasy. Science has since gone to quasi-justify some of this, but none of the ideas were born of scientific rigor. Instead they were invented because Gene Roddenberry needed a cheaper way to get people to the planet surface in ""The Cage"" than a shuttlecraft, which they didn't have the budget to build, so they used an optical effect to have people appear and called it the transporter.<br/><br/>And yet, many Trekkies disagree with me. Mike Stoklasa, of Red Letter Media, is very much on the other side and gets really irritated with the movies from The Next Generation on about how they don't keep to the science of the show. Windows shattering in Generations led to a couple of minute long comment about how they're not glass but transparent aluminum and have gone through so much more stress than landing on a planet. My response is to feign surprise at inconsistency in a franchise that is almost a thousand hours long.<br/><br/>So, when Abrams introduced red matter, seeing a planet destroyed while standing on another planet, and a super nova that will destroy the galaxy, I shrugged at the ridiculousness while others raged. No, none of it is scientific, but neither are transporters.<br/><br/>So, with that out of the way, let's talk about the movie itself.<br/><br/>Time travel brings a mining vessel back in time right in front of the USS Kelvin and commander George Kirk. The situation quickly devolves and the Kelvin is shot to hell. Commander Kirk orchestrates the evacuation but needs to stay behind to give them a chance, forcing his wife and very newborn son to flee without him. This first ten minutes is so successful in terms of short form storytelling, I kind of wish that this was everything. It's clear, emotional, and wonderful to look at as George Kirk sacrifices his own life to save his wife and son.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie isn't as strong, but it's still fun. Abrams has a zippy style that he ends up fitting well to his take on the material. People running around ships as they try to explain things to each other while amusing things are happening (like James Kirk's enlarged hands). Abrams wants to entertain in a propulsive way, and he zips along fast enough that we're just along for the rollercoaster ride.<br/><br/>But, getting into the details of how some of the plot works out reveals this fantasy/science fiction problem in greater detail. The one to point out (because it inexplicably comes back in Into Darkness) is the transwarp beaming concept. On a planet, Kirk finds Old Spock and Scotty. Old Spock inputs a formula from the future into Scotty's computer that suddenly makes it able to transport people in ways that no Star Trek show has even hinted at being possible, across light years and to a ship in warp. No hardware upgrades necessary, apparently. The franchise has always existed on this border between the two genres, but, to take a political term, this movie moved the Overton Window firmly towards fantasy, and that bugs people. It also bugs me, but not enough to kill the film. It bugs me because, within this version of the universe, transwarp beaming invalidates starships completely. It was a quick solution to a plot problem without any concern for how the technology would actually work. It's silly.<br/><br/>Still, the movie zips right past that and the action continues with people running down corridors.<br/><br/>The real strength of the film is the cast. Chris Pine is affable as Kirk. Zachary Quinto captures Spock's essence. Karl Urban is note perfect as McCoy. Even Anton Yelchin is delightful as the seventeen year old Chekov. The movie spends so much time with our crew of the Enterprise that it ends up failing a bit with its protagonist, Nero.<br/><br/>Nero's entire backstory gets told in one data dump about halfway through the movie, which Eric Bana growls through while threatening Captain Christopher Pike. It carries no emotional weight because it comes so late and is delivered so quickly and (nearly) incomprehensibly. The motivation there should have been enough to make Nero an interesting bad guy (although another motivation other than revenge might have been nice), but the delivery is kind of terrible. Our antagonist is really just a scowling guy who shows up every once in a while who hates Spock.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is silly with a conflict that could have been better defined on one side, but it's still a fun two hours. The protagonists are uniformly likable and have great chemistry while the action is well staged and the movie is paced at almost breakneck speeds. It's rather unlike any iteration of Star Trek before it. I overall prefer the ponderousness of The Motion Picture, but I can take this new tone and energy."
"lothos-370-690020","2","2","6","15 July 2015"," Style over substance, with lens flares
","As a big fan of the original films and series I was already concerned when I learned this would be a 'reboot'. The phrase has always bothered me, as it is essentially a way to make more money without spending all that time and money creating a new ideas. Normally when I have low expectations I am pleasantly surprised, not the case with Star Trek 2009. Joke about the over use of lens flares aside, there were two major flaws with this re imagining.<br/><br/>1. The plot holes: <br/><br/>I should not be able to make a list this long of plot holes including multiple scientific errors revolving around the main plot and motivation for the antagonist.<br/><br/>A. Supernova wasn't detected in time to evacuate Romulus. B. Expanded far enough to destroy multiple star systems. C. The one person attempting to find a solution was solely to blame when he didn't arrive in time. D. A mining ship was equipped with a time travel device. E. Same ship also equipped with hi powered weaponry. F. Kirk is transported to a random location on a desolate planet but is a few hundred metres from old Spock and a base equipped with long range teleporters. G. Long range teleporters H. New recruit with no battle or command experience is promoted to captain. I. Everything to do with a liquid that can cause black holes. (too many to list) J. Black hole ceases to exist after destroying Vulcan.<br/><br/>2. Everything everyone else has done before this film is null and void.<br/><br/>One of Star Treks strengths for me, was its rich universe. It was populated with a myriad of creatures which numerous writers took great time and effort to flesh out. With one stroke all of that is gone. With such extreme changes to the time-line, none of what happens in Star Trek ToS, Next Gen, DS9, Voyager, or any of the films happens. The removal of the Vulcans from the Federation coupled with the drastic move towards a more militant Star Fleet changes everything, and occurs far enough in the past to have completely disrupted events that lead to almost everything covered in those shows and films. Some might feel this is a minor issue as we still have those shows and films, which is true, but that is not the point of contention I have with this film. Star Trek was one of the few science fiction shows that put science and diplomacy above action. A franchise that used clever writing and adherence to existing and imagined scientific knowledge and theory that shaped the universe in which it was created. The overall feel of the show was drastically changed to pander to the impatient three second attention span, drooling Michael Bay generation. <br/><br/>Abrams, if you can't remake something without destroying the fundamental aspects which set it aside from everything else in its genre and made it a pioneer of that genre, then you shouldn't remake it. Go ruin something no one cares about like Star Wars."

","I'm not as long winded as some of the reviewers but here is my h.o.. The movie starts out with a stunning opening scene that IMO is arguably one of the best ever in a sci-fi movie opening scene. The birth of Kirk.<br/><br/>The movie moves on to show how Kirk meets some of the main characters from the original series I grew up with. Kirk and all the characters seem fresh and original as they should in an origin script.<br/><br/>The plot is fine, is it perfect like some well-tuned book? I don't know but for a sci-fi movie it's perfect and engaging and totally action packed.<br/><br/>Action: Except for Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country which had a ""few"" notable action scenes. This movie totally kicks butt!! The weapons, the way they appear and operate have all been ""Modernized"" for 2011. It's actually like you would expect it to be if imagined. I was always disappointed by the old ""new"" trek like Next Gen and the Capt. Janeway stuff on Voyager. Even ""Enterprise"" made the old seems fresher and new than years of Next generation and myriad movies. Compared to Starwars they seemed wimpy. But not anymore, the new movies action scenes rival any modern sci-fi movie. <br/><br/>To close, the movie ROCKS! Rent buy whatever but watch it. And if you have big screen plasma with kicking entertainment sound system be prepared to be rocked!"
"Quebec_Dragon","7","2","6","7 May 2010"," Satisfied but still hungry for more
","I admit I got sucked in by the great reviews and that my expectations were probably too high. I had a good time but I wasn't blown away by it. Why? Weirdly, it might be some of the plot elements (mostly scientific) that hindered my enjoyment. They seemed illogical as Mr. Spock would say. I know Star Trek is supposed to be space opera but the thinking man's humanistic space opera and those seemingly illogical elements created plot holes and coincidences that bugged me. I was even thinking of including most of them in this review with an attempt at explanations but it would make this too long and way too geeky ;-) (read the lower-rated reviews on IMDb if you're curious). Don't get me wrong, the script is fun with enjoyable character moments, a few good surprises, its fair share of adventure and space scenes but enjoy the ride and try not to think too hard.<br/><br/>I loved the introduction in space. I thought it was great, dramatic and surprising. The young years of Kirk would have benefited from a little more time but one shouldn't be too greedy and it would have taken time from somewhere else. The casting of the movie was very strong with the highlights for me being the new Spock (the guy actually made me forget his other famous role as Sylar in Heroes) and Dr. McCoy (cynical and even looking very similar). It's amazing how Star Trek references have seeped into modern culture and I think almost anyone, even non-Trekkers, will enjoy the references and homages, especially how the younger actors play their iconic counterparts without turning them into bad caricatures (some might disagree about Chekhov and Scotty but I personally loved them). Almost every crew member besides Kirk and Spock has its moment in the spotlight and yet you wish you would see more of them which is a compliment in itself. The villain would have benefited from being better; he was definitely the weak link. He was underwhelming and stupid. I'm not sure if the culprit was the writing or the interpretation by Eric Bana, probably a mix of both. I also disliked the little alien partner of Scotty and I have no idea why he was included except perhaps to add a cutesy factor and sell action figures.<br/><br/>Most of the introductions, meetings and interactions between the adult crew members were joyous and sometimes surprising. The story does keep you guessing as to what will happen next after a particular major event. The pace was good, it was filmed dynamically but the fight scenes were victims of zoomed in shaky cameras preventing us from really seeing them well. Not as bad as other recent American films though. The visual effects were very good except for a few blinding lens flares. There were a couple of moments where I got the shivers (good ones) but then that's because I've been a fan of Star Trek for so long. One was when I saw the Enterprise for the first time (very well modernized yet faithful to the old exterior look, not really so in the inside) and the other time in the middle I cannot reveal except to say that this line made me realize that anything could happen. One could argue that the writers could have been bolder making for a stronger dramatic story but at the risk of alienating the hardcore faithful who might be offended by the reboot anyway. Those trekkers might say the new Star Trek movie invalidates every other Star Trek story out there. I prefer to think that those stories might still be mostly valid (especially those from Next Generation and after) or at least valid in a parallel dimension/universe/timeline whatever. The new Star Trek does free the writers to boldly go where no one has gone before. It was a valiant fun effort well worth watching but I do hope the next instalment is more clever and logical while retaining (or improving) emotional resonance.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"
"lewiskendell","6","2","6","13 April 2010"," I can't help but wish that the re-launch was accompanied by a better story.
","I have a feeling that I'm missing a bit of the intended Star Trek experience, by not watching it on the big screen. It's easy to see how the action sequences and special effects would make a much bigger impression at the theater, and without those to blow the viewer away, the movie has to depend on its less flashy elements. This isn't to the film's advantage. <br/><br/>At times it ""feels"" like Star Trek, and at times it absolutely doesn't. This is coming from a mild Trek fan, at best. The story didn't do much for me. It's like the writers latched onto the very first semi-decent idea that they had, when it wouldn't have hurt to brainstorm a bit more. Nero seems a lot more like a villain from a forgettable TV episode, than the grand return of the series to the big screen. Most of the cast made little impression on me at all.They certainly won't be replacing the original actors in my mind. This is a decent sci-fi movie with above-average special effects, but that's all."
"tom-709-390243","8","2","6","10 April 2010"," A well paced action adventure, but not a great Star Trek movie
","I have mixed feelings about this movie. As a movie it is above average, a well paced action adventure with enough comic relief thrown in to break up the tension. As a Star Trek saga, however, it leaves a lot to be desired. I have the distinct impression that the director J.J. Abrams would much prefer to make a Star Wars movie. <br/><br/>Now I like Star Wars, with it fanciful stories and supernatural theme; however, Star Trek is more the art of the possible with normal humans struggling in an alien universe. Roddenberry envisioned an idealistic society that existed on a well defined technological base. He closely guarded that vision and would not allow the established technological principals to be violated. <br/><br/>Abrams was bound by no such vision. It is my impression that he purposefully strived to remake Star Trek into a variant of Star Wars. Gene Roddenberry would have hated Abrams movie. <br/><br/>Go to my web site -- star-trek.fl-ink -- to read more about this movie."
"lain_alphard","9","2","6","13 March 2010"," It's Worth Waiting
","Yes, it's almost a year since it came out. But when I watched it again a few days ago, from DVD, I had this sudden urge to review it. <br/><br/>I don't consider myself as a Trekkie. I'm a huge fan of Star Trek series, but I only went as far as watching them. When I heard it would be rebooted, I was so excited. And by J.J. Abrams! But I have fear that I may not be able to see it in the theaters in my country. Star Trek series, I notice, are not that popular outside of US; so you could imagine how happy I was when Star Trek was finally released in my hometown, though it took almost six months! However, as the title of my review suggested, it's worth waiting. It definitely is.<br/><br/>First, the story. Basically, it's about how the original crews got together. I won't be subjective, since I'm a huge fan, by saying it's an extraordinary writing. It has smart and funny dialogs and moments. I found myself laughing hard quite often, and I had this thrill feeling each time Kirk met his future crews (especially his one and only soul mate, Spock) and when he took a glimpse of his ship-to-be Enterprise through the shuttle's window. Nevertheless, there were a bit cheesy moments; for example, when Pike told Kirk about those whole following his father's steps or the way Kirk and Spock ""got together"". I'm stunned, though, by the idea of an alternate reality--not in the authenticity sense. IMO, that was a clever move from Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman to liberate them from the series and previous movies.<br/><br/>Next, the effects. You can't have a science fiction movie with bad effects. And Star Trek passes the test. It's nothing new, really, but that didn't matter. I wasn't looking for a new one, anyway. What I cared for more was that it could give me a real feeling of future and space. And it did. In addition, the score (Michael Giacchino) is amazing. It takes your emotion deeper--most notable was when they managed to escape the black hole.<br/><br/>The one that I enjoyed the most is definitely the acting. It has perfect casts who gave perfect performances (and there's Leonard Nimoy, the original Spock!). I particularly love Chris Pine's. Zachary Quinto is also amazing, but IMHO he resembles Nimoy too much. Pine, on the other hand, brought William Shatner's sense but was also able to add his own; it's very refreshing, very enjoyable. I love their chemistry. And it's nice knowing that in RL their closeness is also very much like their characters--as I saw in their interviews together.<br/><br/>Of course, a movie isn't all about story, effects, music, and acting. There are lots of people involved--editing, cinematography, costume, make up, etc. And Star Trek succeed in combining all of them into an amazing experience for its audiences.<br/><br/>And now I can't wait for the sequel."
"jaustenaa","8","2","6","22 February 2010"," Good, but not Star Trek
","For a nerd like me, this movie is worth it just to see the new going-to-warp computer animation. The movie however, is not very Star Trek-ish. Star Trek is, as many have pointed out before me, about the ideas. Ideas like in the future, we have so advanced technology that no-one needs to be poor. Abundant energy and replicator technology make everything almost free. Thus famine and greed have been eliminated, and people of this future are instead working to improving themselves and working for their ideals.<br/><br/>The original Star Trek ideas was, for instance, problems is possible to solve without violence, racism does not exist and compassion and dialogue is used actively in diplomatic situations. Ideas that say we shouldn't interfere with the developments of aliens on other planets, but wait to make contact until they have developed warp technology. Ideas like if we create robots or an android with artificial intelligence, it automatically have every right a living being would. If they are alive, we have no right to abuse them as laborers. Watching the older Star Trek series and films can teach you a lot.<br/><br/>The Star Trek 2009 movie have very few of these ideas. Star Trek 2009 uses the amazing sci-fi from the Star Trek universe, but leaves out this interesting future culture. It's an action-blast with little of the Star Trek soul. They try compassion, but fail with a smirk undertone and no real effort in saving an enemy. I find this very alien to the older Star Trek. Maybe we can expect two star trek types in the future, one for the kids and one for young adults.<br/><br/>The Star Trek Enterprise series from 2001 seems to be a mix. We get perspective and good insight because of the high intelligent scripts, but also a lot more action and violence."

","I used a similar title to my 'District 9' review, but it also fits here. I admit I'm not a Star Trek fan but I love Star Wars. Still, I knew the basics going in and I liked viewing the movie from that perspective.<br/><br/>I think the script worked very well. It was smart and didn't seem too offensive to hardcore fans from what I could tell. It was tightly paced but also rich with content. I also though the origin story was the way to go because, well it worked. Putting Leonard Nimoy in without forcing it was a great accomplishment and much appreciated.<br/><br/>Chris Pine seems to have been deeply influenced by John Travolta, which I'm not sure is a good thing or a bad thing but there it is. Zachary Quinto more or less nailed Spock in my opinion. I also liked how they managed to involve all the major characters AND how they came to be members of the Enterprise's crew. Another testament to a great script.<br/><br/>I'm actually jealous. I wish some of the properties I'm more devoted to had scripts this good. A great idea for a sci-fi buff and very solid for anyone else, although I am disappointed so many Trekkies are mad about it. I know the feeling (Star Wars)."

A fairly engaging storyline (if a little muddled at times), some amazing special effects and good performances, particularly from Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock). The two actors manage to capture the essence of the characters without becoming caricatures of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. Kudos also go to Karl Urban with his fun portrayal of the irascible Dr ""Bones"" McCoy. On the negative side, some screamingly bad CGI aliens, one too many unbelievable plot twists and coincidences and a pointless romantic sub- plot between two of Trek's iconic characters that just doesn't ring true. And whatever you do, don't mention Spock's teeth ! And I'm talking the original Spock here not Quinto's version.

","I'm really surprised how many 1, 2 and 3 star reviews of ST09 are in this site. I enjoyed the movie immensely at the theater, bought the DVD, and have watched it half a dozen times since. I don't consider myself a Trekkie or Trekker because I can't speak Klingon, tell you the color of Zephram Cockran's shirt, or name the writers of every show in the first season. (But if I could, I would call myself a Trekkie, not a Trekker.) However, I did watch the very first airing of the very first episode. ""The Man Trap,"" in 1965 when I had just turned ten, and watched every show of the original series as they came out. I once skipped a Boy Scout camping trip to watch the episode, ""Assignment: Earth"" (a great disappointment.) <br/><br/>I had no desire to see Star Trek TOS done again, and haven't liked a Star Trek movie since ""The Return Home."" (""Well, ""First Contact"" was pretty good- but it was the only STTNG movie that was!) So I received ST09 with an open mind. I didn't expect it to be the same; it couldn't be. It had to appeal to a very different audience. I was interested in seeing what they came up with.<br/><br/>Star Trek 2009 had an intrinsic problem to solve; what does Star Trek need to be for its audience in the 21st century, and how do we get there from here -- one century closer to the date of the series itself! But actually getting there was put into the background, so we could zero in on the new actors playing the old characters-- the fun part. Plot logic and continuity didn't have a high priority in this film. How could Spock Prime watch the destruction of Vulcan from another moon or planet-- if it was in his solar system, the other planets would be pulled into it; if it were from even the closest solar system Vulcan would be an invisible dot circling a pinpoint of light. How did Kirk, Sulu and Olsen dive from space into the atmosphere at a perfect right angle to the threshold without burning up like the space shuttle Columbia? How the hell did Spock manage to illegally banish Kirk from the Enterprise only to send him only eleven miles from Spock Prime who he didn't even know existed, amidst all the vastness of space? If you're looking for a story that makes sense, ST09 is not for you.<br/><br/>But since when did Star Trek ever make sense? Since when do explosions in space make sound? When did the concept of the Universal Translator ever make sense? How can a computer suddenly extrapolate the language of a culture it hasn't even made First Contact with? And would you actually eat any food that was made in a replicator? Are warp drive, time distortions and tele-porter beams really science or a hi-tech kind of magic? Everyone just puts the line where we suspend disbelief in our own place, that's all. <br/><br/>ST09 always struck me as the post-911 remix. ""We were once innocent and optimistic, but that is all gone and now we live in an alternate reality in which our father and mother were killed by alien terrorists."" Its like a snapshot of what's become of us by way of the Great Speckled Bird. Its compelling enough that lots of us-- not all of us-- don't need to pay attention too carefully to the background. And according to the box office, the Abrams team got the depiction right. That understanding informs my enjoyment of the picture.<br/><br/>Chris Pine creates his own Kirk but at times shockingly invokes Shatner effortlessly, whether he's slouching in the captain's seat or intoning the name ""Bones!"" Zachary Quinto, though never reminding me of Nimoy, always inhabited Spock's identity, practically never invoking Sylar. His voice is actually softer and gentler than Nimoy's, playing the same character in the original. <br/><br/>One of the biggest changes in the Trek Canon was the character of Uhuru. You can't make a big-budget wide-appeal movies nowadays without having far stronger female characters than Gene Roddenberry had. Modern women would never accept a Communications Officer Uhuru who had nothing to do but turn on the Universal Translator and automatic ship-wide radio at the beginning of her shift. Zoe Saldana fends off Kirk's boorish advances, intercepts and translates elusive Klingon radio transmissions, runs long-leggedly through the Enterprise's halls in her famous mini-skirt, and badgers Spock to assign her to the Enterprise even if it looks like favoritism. So what if she's in a love triangle with Spock and Kirk? Here's a woman fit for a starring role in the film. About Vulcan time!<br/><br/>I loved Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin, Ben Cross and Bruce Greenwood recreating the series' characters-- even though this Captain Pike could have been the father of the original Jeffrey Hunter Captain Pike. (J.J. Abrams said they wanted an actor to capture the Kennedyesque quality of Hunter in the original series, so they got the guy who played Kennedy (very well) in Thirteen Days.) <br/><br/>Eric Bana brings a lot of working-class gravitas to a role that is just patched together to give the actors something to do. He's always fun to watch. By the way, Nero has more motivation in this film than many of the other reviewers give him credit for; he slaughtered the Kelvin mad with grief over the death of his family and his planet, only minutes before he destroyed the USS Kelvin. Then he and his ship were captured and imprisoned and tortured by the Klingons for 25 years before escaping, explaining why his face was so twitchy in one extended closeup. He became an obsessed crackpot in prison. Buy this entire sequence was cut out of the theatrical version.<br/><br/>Well, that's my take on the movie. Not so bad if you have a sense of humor."
"darin-wissbaum","5","2","6","22 November 2009"," Fun but filled with plot holes...
","This film started off as being very entertaining and it was interesting to see and learn about the early days of James Kirk, Spock, Sulu and all the rest of the old Enterprise crew. The special effects were top notch and I must say that Zachary Quinto really looks like a young Leonard Nimoy. But with that being said from someone who watched the old Star Trek series and knows all about the characters backgrounds this film is filled with a ton of plot holes. For example, Spocks mother was never killed and there are several old episodes in which she is part of the story and if you even watch Star Trek The Voyage Home she is alive and well. Also the planet Vulcan in the old series was always there and was never destroyed and the Vulcans were never an endangered people. Pavel Chekov was not part of the Enterprise crew till the second season of the series and yet he comes in during the time of Captian Pike. And speaking of Captian Pike he did not leave the Enterprise crew as an Admiral but rather was burned badly and was unable to speak or walk ever again. Why the filmmakers would take these types of liberties with the facts is beyond me. Why not just show how they all became part of the crew and have just a simple but entering classic Star Trek story? I know it is just a movie but it does a bit of a disservice to the old series with these crazy contradictions. And what is with the writers of Star Trek and time Travel? It is getting old. What I would have wanted to see is someone in there latter years like Leonard Nimoy as an elder Spock for example being that he is in this film to tell the story to a group of just graduating cadets about the Early days of Captain Kirk and the Enterprise crew. You know kind of a way to inspire them. Star Trek has lost its gas and it is time to put it to rest...."
"mergatroid-1","5","2","6","18 November 2009"," No where near as good as I was led to believe
","This movie was ""OK"".<br/><br/>I am a Trekkie, and have been since I watched the first series air.<br/><br/>I have seen everything Trek over and over, and I admit I've been getting a little bored of it lately. I have never believed any of the series or movies have really captured the feel or the original series.<br/><br/>I grew up on Armed Forces bases, and one of the things I liked about the original series was that it felt military. I loved Kirk snapping orders MISTER! It gave the series a little legitimacy.<br/><br/>Then came The Next Generation, and while I liked the series over all, one of the dumbest things I have ever seen was the inclusion of children on the Enterprise. This was a military vessel, could be destroyed at any time, and the writers would have us believe the crew would take their children with them. I had to overlook that stupidity every time I watched.<br/><br/>At least DS9 was a little better even if it did over do the religion aspect (why would an enlightened race ""worship"" wormhole aliens?).<br/><br/>Voyager was different, but not as much as I had hoped. Then came ""Enterprise"" that basically drove the nail in the coffin of the Star Trek franchise. The crew was fine, as was the acting. Unfortunately, once AGAIN, the writers figured canon didn't matter. Now, on to this movie. ""Not bad"" is the best I can say for it. I could understand the story, and even go along with most of the things they did. But some things were just stupid. What's a young Kirk doing being able to steal an antique car, be able to drive it, be able to get gas to make it work? And excuse me, but Federation Starships being constructed ON THE GROUND? Stupid, impractical and impossible considering none of the large star ships were ever designed to fly in an atmosphere (excluding Voyager). Spock is barely even Vulcan in this movie. Writers just have to have their own way. If you come up with an alien in a movie, and he's very popular to the fans, and you have a new writer for the next movie he's just got to try and make the character something he's not. Sure, Spock always had his human emotions to fight off, and apparently now so do all the rest of the Vulcans. I know that it's always been alluded there were emotions buried under layers of logic in Vulcans, but not to the extreme that would have us believe in this movie. Spock was always the exception because he is half human, not the rule. And even so, he was damned good at burying his emotions, almost as good as other Vulcans. Spock's father admits he married his wife because he loved her? Shoot that writer and move on to the next.<br/><br/>The entire planet of Vulcan is blowed up REAL GOOD, and where's the Federation? They send a few ships to what they think is a rescue mission, and they get blowed up too. After that, there might as well not even be a Federation. Here's this giant ship, blowed up Vulcan and is currently working on blowing up the Earth, and not a single ship around to challenge it. Not a single one. You would hardly know that, at this period in time, the Federation was not on good terms with any number of races, including the Romulans, and the Klingons. You'd think there would be a few ships in the neighborhood to defend the seat of the Federation. As other people have mentioned, the Evil Villain had no good reason to have a hate-on for Spock in the first place, unless he had the IQ of a doorknob (like the writers). To top it all off, he could have used his massive ship to SAVE ROMULAN, but NNNNNOOOOOOO, that would make too much sense for these writers. No one ever accused Hollywood writers of having brains. Just don't get me started on the ""red matter"". Doh!<br/><br/>To top all these problems off , JJ weed smoker tells us (on the blu-ray extras) he didn't have the money for some of the sets he wanted to build, so what does he do? He uses an old power station to stand-in as the engine room for one Federation ship, and uses a freeking beer factory for a stand-in of the Enterprise engine room. This is the worst, stupidest, most moronic thing I have ever seen. Not only do these places not look anything like any engine room conceived anywhere ever, but other than just looking stupid they also make no sense. If you have a huge spaceship, do you waste reams and reams of space on ""emptyness"" or do you use every cubic centimeter to good purpose?<br/><br/>I have seen a LOT of bad scifi in my days. Many of these bad movies had very low budgets, and since they couldn't afford sets guess what they did? They used factories, water plants, dams and maybe even power plants and beer factories to stand-in for real sets. Well JJ, guess what you made this Star Trek movie look like? You made it look like you ran out of money half way through, and then went the way of the ""B"" movie.<br/><br/>Sure, this movie was entertaining. And there were some excellent spots. One of the things that really kills me is that they did not have to ignore canon. They were just lazy writers. It would have been simple for a true fan to work with this story, make the movie every bit as exciting as it is, but not beat the crap out of canon at all. I have to say a lot of ""fans"" are better writers than the people who wrote this movie."
"ch4151","8","2","6","8 November 2009"," Wonderful Reboot
","This movie did exactly what it was supposed to do - to boost the Star Trek franchise and attract new fans. The movie feels fresh with good story telling, a new set, and the new cast. Good acting is not always found in this genre. <br/><br/>I'm old enough to watch entire the Next Generation w/o missing an episode during its first run. But admit it, the science and logic of the Star Trek series are not exactly, well, logical. The format of talkative, lecture laden with not always fresh messages, doesn't translate well to the big screen nowadays. The fact is that the entertainment industry is profit first. A franchise needs to attract a brand new generation of fans to stay alive and flourish. The movie did just that.<br/><br/>After all, isn't being open-minded an important message from Star Trek?"

","I wouldn't dare to call my self a ""hard core"" Star Trek fan but I have seen all series/movies except for most of the '60 ones, which is a bit of a bad thing when watching this movie. Keeping that in mind, I must say, I loved it! <br/><br/>Cool & balanced special effects, great casting, even better acting (in most cases) and an worthy plot. Personally, I would've lost the somewhat irritating lens light glows all over the movie and tuned Chekov's accent down a notch, but, apart from that, everything else is perfect. <br/><br/>Still, this movie is best for Star Trek fans. It's not like you must know all there is to know from the franchise but still, you would experience this movie better if knowing a few of the basic things, I think. If not, then it might be a perfect place to start?"
"jkd15-1","7","2","6","26 October 2009"," Almost but not quite
","Before I start. This was a good movie and entertaining. Some of the fight scenes with the Enterprise were awesome. Especially the final fight scene where the Enterprise comes out of the black hole with cannons blazing.<br/><br/>I wasn't a fan of the voices though. Kirks was very good but only done once. Scotties was pitiful and without the sincerity of the original. Oh and it sounded fake. The one I liked was from Checkoff(spelling).<br/><br/>The movie tried to jam too much into the film without creating character or relationships. There was little chemistry between characters and the time warp with the original Spock was corny.<br/><br/>With all that negative, it was still a decent watchable movie. Makes me want to watch the original for the great chemistry and banter.<br/><br/>I am saddened by the miscues but entertained by the overall movie."
"lloyd1018","9","2","6","16 October 2009"," It's all about the characters
","I didn't have high expectations for this film. It seemed like an insurmountable challenge to me: producing a fulfilling prequel to the original Star Trek series. I doubted that a new cast could provide the chemistry of combative characters that made the 1960's series so enjoyable. Any doubts I had have now been cast adrift into the void of space. The first meeting between Kirk and Bones was magic. Karl Urban nails McCoy from the word go. Kudos to this actor for breathing life into one of my favorite ST characters. I didn't feel that the chemistry was quite as strong between the science office and Kirk. Hopefully we will see more of Spock's human side as this movie franchise develops. He did show a rebellious side to his personality when confronted by Vulcan elders. Bodes well for the future. It was great to see all the old favorites return in young guises such as Scotty, Chekov and Sulu. There was even an unexpected budding romance involving Uhuru.<br/><br/>The plot of this film was nothing special and the bad guy was pretty one dimensional. But for me it wasn't about the plot. It was about the interaction of Kirk and his crew. It was about a maverick star ship officer forming relationships with his crew and friends as they prepare to embark on adventures throughout the universe. At the end of this flick I was left yearning for more. It felt kinda sad seeing the original cast man The Enterprise as they qualified for their old age pensions. Near the end they really were flogging a dead horse. Now Star Trek has been reinvigorated with talented fresh faces who I suspect will win over a whole new generation of devotees. J J Abrams you've made my day. Can't believe all the negative reviews here. Think the 8+ overall score for this film is more indicative of its strength. Not surprised that a sequel has been green lighted. As I said, I can't wait to see the next installment."

","Before I went to see this movie, I thought Wolverine was a decent way to start off the summer season, that is until I saw Star Trek, and thought it was better than Wolverine on all levels. <br/><br/>Star Trek is the definition of a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>It has amazing special effects, good character development, which is what many blockbusters are lacking these days, an intriguing story, and it takes you into another world. <br/><br/>Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are perfectly cast as Kirk and Spock, Zoe Saldana did a good job as Uhura, Simon Pegg was funny as Scotty, Anton Yelchin was very charismatic as Chekov, and I enjoyed seeing Winona Ryder on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this has what a lot of summer blockbusters are missing, and I would recommend this movie to everyone. It's fun, exciting, powerful, well-acted, and humorous, and you don't need to be a fan of the TV show to like the movie, Star Trek is for everybody.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"
"Jackpollins","8","2","6","13 August 2009"," Very good, but over-hyped
","It's rare to find a good remake of a retro show that fits the time that they are remaking it. That's why I was happy to find Star Trek, a very good addition into the over-hyped list of good films. It's a nice mix of action, humor, and drama that did not quite deserve the recognition it got. Chris Pine play James T. Kirk, a troublemaker as a kid, now a space captain as an adult. Pine does a good job at following in Shatner's shoes. Zachary Quinto as well does a good job of following in Nimoy's shoes as Spock. I can't say they live up to Shatner's or Nimoy's greatness, but they certainly do do a very good job. It's an over-recognized film that's certainly still a very good film. I can also say anyone looking for the Leonard Nimoy cameo won't be let down and the supporting cast adds to the fun. But ultimately it's not the great film I was reading about, it's just a good film. It's very entertaining, ultimately satisfying film. Simon Pegg shows up towards the end as Montgomery Scott, and is hilarious and interesting, and it's a great performance. This is a fun and satisfying film that won't have you talking after the movie about it, and it's certainly not groundbreaking, just a simply good film."
"greycloud-3","4","2","6","13 June 2009"," Good movie but many things wrong with it.
","Good movie to watch and growing up watching star trek and knowing it's time line, i would like to add that there are a few things wrong with this movie. Chekov did not appear on the enterprise until the second season of star trek TOS. Planet Vulcan did not get sucked up into a black hole as it still existed in the series and other movies. In this new movie, the Enterprise was way too advanced to be the same ship in the series. Spock's mother did not die in the series and other movies. Captain Christopher Pike looked too old in this new movie when in the series, he looked younger. The original Scotty in the series and other movies did not have interstellar transporter knowledge. Captain Kirk did not become captain until after Spock served with Capt Christopher Pike as in the episode, The Cage in star trek TOS. I know Spock said that in his own reality, Kirks father did live to see his son grow up to become captain. So sorry to spoil such a good movie so i would have to say the whole movie in itself is set in an alternate universe."
"mvsunstar","5","2","6","20 May 2009"," To boldy go where everyone has gone before ...
","Honestly, I came out of the movie feeling exhilarated. The action was non-stop and the characters were enjoyable. Kirk, Spock and Bones were all played spot on and had me believing in them as younger editions from TOS. Scotty, Ohura, Sulu and Checkov all had makeovers from the originals, keeping only remnant characteristics intact - but nonetheless, entertaining. The CGI and special effects were fantastic, except for the first door at the star fleet base on the ice planet. No, I don't have a particular thing for doors, but this looked like it came from Home Depot.<br/><br/>And here in lies the problem. I realize now that I have been successfully dumbed down by Hollywood. All through the movie in the back of my mind I found myself questioning the logic, the very simple plausibility of it all.<br/><br/>For starters, there are the undeniable Star Wars plot similarities. Time travel - please, this is getting to be so passe. Although I understand the desire to start a new time line from the original, more thought should have gone into hammering out the details then to have some coal miner from the future hunt down future Spock for trying to save his world (groan). The chance meeting with future Spock in an ice cave - this was killing me inside. I hate these esoteric, universe connecting moments that stand utterly and completely outside the realm of reality. But what really had me was the use of something called 'Red Matter'. I had to laugh. It's like souped up vampire blood mixed with anti-matter. This was so lame. And as another reviewer stated, only drops were needed to create black holes but Old Spock was carrying around gallons of the stuff. WTH! And if only a drop creates so much destruction then when the mining ship is destroyed at the end you'd think the whole universe would have been obliterated. I mean there were, many, many drops in future Spock's ship. Whoever thought of this as the Death Star should be shot. And what is with the lack of old people in the future and by old I mean people at least over 30. Do star ships only get piloted by children? And why does a mining ship from the future have the extraordinary ability to destroy so many star fleet ships. I mean it can't be shielding as the Kelvin clearly did some damage to it when it rammed it. It certainly can't be maneuverability, look at the size of the thing. Perhaps, it is the sheer alien ugliness of it all that just strikes fear into the hearts of all those who fly before it. I mean give me a break, a mining ship from the future- WTF! Since when do mining ships come fitted out as battle cruisers. One last thing - what about the time police from the very far future? Were they watching porn when this whole event unfolded and simply missed the ball.<br/><br/>But, as I previously mentioned I somehow entered a dumbed down, less critical, blithering mass of exhilaration. I was drawn into the action, allowing myself to transcend the ridiculous story elements. Only after wards, in fact the next day, did some common sense come seeping back.<br/><br/>So for me the movie is a mix of greatness (loved the characters) with a mix of ridiculousness (Hollywood style). Would it be too much to ask for things that make some sense?"
"fantasywriter411","Null","2","6","18 May 2009"," Something about Romulans
","*****This comment may contain Spoilers*****<br/><br/>One small point regarding, Nero, the Romulan character from the future. Romulans were first introduced in an episode from the original television series titled ""Balance of Terror."" In that episode the entire bridge crew was stunned to learn that Romulans actually looked like Vulcans. Up to that point no one, in Star Fleet, had ever seen a Romulan. Interesting point considering that a vengeful Romulan from the future is so central in this current Star Trek feature. ""If memory serves,"" this is also where the Star Trek lore, regarding the Vulcan origin of the Romulans, began. All this is quite minor consider the visual wow factor of the current feature.<br/><br/>Additionally, the concept of Transwarp, according to Star Trek lore, was first discovered by Spock. This is based on events that occurred in the original television episode titled ""The Tholian Web."" The term ""interphase"" was used to discuss travel between our universe and the alternate universe discovered in that episode. Beyond that, the current Star Trek feature is quite spectacular and well worth the viewing. I took my nephew and he is now hooked on the franchise. What a ride."
"Low Man","7","2","6","14 May 2009"," It Needed Better Writing
","Having Spock chased through time by his very own revenge obsessed Khan-doppleganger and screwing up the canonic Star Trek universe in the process isn't a bad idea. In fact, it's a rather appealing conceit. It simply needed more thought than it seems to have had.<br/><br/>To wit:<br/><br/>1. A magical, unexplained, and apocolyptically lethal material at the center of the threat is just lazy. Creating scientific implausibilities to fill in the need for dramatic development is standard in sf stories, but for cryin' out loud, give it some internal logical consistency. We know something about black holes these days, so fudging the science on them is a guaranteed way to throw the ohfergodssakegimeeafreakinbreak switch on a person's willingness to suspend disbelief. (Those who care about such things know what I mean. Those who don't should probably read someone else's review.) As attendees of filmic shadow plays, most are happy to be lied to. Frequently, that's why one goes to the theater in the first place. A happy lie, a sad lie, an absurd lie, etc. It's all part of the entertainment gestalt. You can tell me black is white, but there'd better be plausible exposition if you want me to believe it. Failing that, I'll believe whatever you tell me about the colors smyzgetrunleo and bristarglfloss as long as it doesn't keep adapting as needed. Deus ex machina (or diabolis ex machina in this case I suppose) really is all played out, and it seems like lazy writing to me. Get me? Well maybe I'm giving free rein to a glut of pecksniffery, but it bugs me.<br/><br/>2. The antagonist is out to destroy planets full of beings he's never heard of because Spock failed to save Romulus in a timely fashion? It's possible I suppose, but it seems awfully weak in believability and pathetically weak from a dramatic standpoint. There's gotta be more to it, but without knowing what it is, I don't buy it. It needed more development or a different approach. I know he'd probably rather eat a pyramid of Giza sized pile of rancid head cheese chased with a million gallons of sour milk than get attached to the Star Trek franchise again, but this is the sort of thing at which Harlan Ellison excels. I think he could have made the story a truly gut-wrenching piece of drama. As presented, it really was pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>Those two quibbles aside, though, I still enjoyed the film quite a bit. It played, for me, a lot like a TV pilot episode. There was a gratifying amount of character development as well as copious references to past episodes of the various Star Trek series' to keep the general fan population happy. (All right. I probably qualify for the Trekkie category, but what the hell.) It has many fine moments, dramatic and comic, and reaches an admirable thespian standard...for a television series. I feel like there's an alternate time line series somewhere in the future, in movies if not on TV or direct to DVD. If that's the case, bravo. I'll probably be back to see it. As a stand alone event, however, it really needed better writing. It's something from which all of the Star Trek offerings have suffered to a greater or lesser extent, not because good writers did not work with the series, but because they always seem to get restrained somehow and never quite break out of the TV mold. If you want more explanation of this view, the published screen play version of the original series episode ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" by Harlan Ellison delineates the problem better than anything I could say here. It might be interesting to see that made in the alternate universe cast expanded to film length. (Note to the producers: Don't do it without Harlan! I mean it.) Still...I feel I can recommend this movie to you with a clear conscience. It is better than average, and may be (I haven't quite decided yet) the best of the Star Trek films yet made. Industrial Light & Magic certainly went hog wild with it, so it looks astoundingly good. Where they go with it from here will be telling. I am hopeful."

This movie goes to the origins of the first adventure of USS ENTERPRISE. You got James Tiberius Kirk(Chris Pine), a cocky trouble-making with the taste for a thrill. After he was born, he gets some reprieve to join the Federation by a Captain Pike(Bruce Greenwood) who remembers George Kirk for his bravery against the Romulans. He meets Ulhura(Zoe Saldona) at a bar, gets a shot to be in the Federation following the brawl. On planet Vulcan, there's is Spock, who is a half-breed gets to do the same thing; join the Federation. Nero(Eric Bana), is a nutshell. Blaming Spock for the destruction of his planet, he destroys Vulcan for his troubles. Getting all the crew to battle him took lots of determination and a little bit of logic from The Future Spock(Leonard Nimoy) which helps prevent an uncertain future. Just not seeing this movie, is totally illogical. Plenty of plot enough energy to keep you on the edge of your seats. With a touch of humor ""Star Trek"" will time warp you to galaxies far away.

"vernmcc","10","4","17","8 May 2009"," Wow, a fantastic twist to make a fresh start
","I have been a fan of the Star Trek series from the mid seventies, when the original series went into syndication in NYC. I have always been intrigued by the possibilities of the story and have been disappointed by the latest versions of TV series that seem to be running in mud trying to engage the audience and struggling to adhere to the genre's story arc.<br/><br/>This movie is a breath of fresh air. It successfully detaches from the genre's arc yet is absolutely true to the original characters. The movie grabs you from the first moment of the film and doesn't let go until the end. I would suggest you hit the rest room before it starts, because there was no obvious slow portion of the film that you could safely miss. The character development of the original cast is so tightly woven into the story line that they are not side stories, but the character development accelerates the whole story.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the few I would recommend to actually take the time to see in a theater. The scenes and score are amazingly matched and the big screen really helps pull the viewer into the story.<br/><br/>There are moments in the movie to cheer and moments to cry. Yet at the end, I felt like I knew life long friends even better."
"jr747","10","4","17","8 May 2009"," It has everything! And this reboot was...logic!
","This movie is even better than I had expected and than the trailers suggested! I deem it one of the best Star Trek Movies ever (if not the best) and one of the best movies I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Even though I had high expectations due to first reviews and the belief in J.J. Abrams' skills, I still was astonished by this film. <br/><br/>First of all I expected it to be action-packed - which it is indeed, but I never thought it would be so hilariously funny at the same time, as this is something the trailers do not reveal. It actually is great fun!<br/><br/>The second, even bigger surprise is J.J. Abrams' approach to Star Trek. As he himself committed that he had never been a fan of Trek, and as the franchise with it's out of fashion, nerdy image and rather unsuccessful recent outings seemed more or less lying to the ground (I personally doubted if we would ever see the final frontiers of outer space on the big screen again), I thought we would see a complete relaunch that does have the label ""Star Trek"" on it but is an overall new concept with a new feel for a new generation of viewers. To my delight I had to find that it is not(only)! J.J. really succeeded with a balancing act here: While he managed to shake all the nerdyness of the franchise, opening it for almost all kinds of viewers, he revealed so much knowledge about and respect for the Star Trek universe, that this film after all still has the look and the feel of Star Trek - it simply IS Star Trek! <br/><br/>If you are not a Trekkie, go and see this movie - and you will be one, soon! If you are or have been a Trekkie, you must see it! You will have the time of your life, getting wet eyes, discovering so much that is familiar to you in a completely new way. It's like meeting old friends again - boldly coming along with them where no one has gone before.<br/><br/>Annex: <br/><br/>Some words to those hardcore Trekkies, who are upset about this film, as it alters the known ST timeline / starts a new one: Don't get me wrong, I understand your point very well, being a Trekkie myself I am familiar with time travel and it's consequences and therefore know what this is all about. But after all as time travel is possible in ST universe, you cannot be a fan of Trek and at the same time deny the possibility of an alternative timeline as created in this movie!<br/><br/>Furthermore you have to face it: without this reboot ST probably would have been dead! The makers of previous ST movies and shows failed in breathing new life into this franchise. Therefore A reboot such successful, keeping the franchise alive, was only possible with someone from the outside. Thus it was to expect that nothing would be the same again with J.J. in charge. But instead of telling a story, based upon ST, but not sticking to the history that has been told in the recent 40 years, J.J. explained all alterations to the known history in perfect consistency with the ST universe's logic! Nothing more could we have hoped for. We can be grateful, that so much of the original ST has been preserved and now may live on!<br/><br/>If you still are upset, that all the things, that you have seen on the screen during the last 40 years now may not have happened / won't happen: grow up and face the truth - it's fiction! Check your DVD boxes: it's all still there!"

","As a young Star Trek fan, I wanted to watch the JJ Abraham's reboot to learn more about the universe and the characters before I watch the series. Well I was a bit disappointed as Chris Pine performance is for me, not good enough to beat such expectations from a very solid fan community. However, the images and sounds are excellent and Spock is really well played, but even me, a Guy who does not know much about Star Trek universe, was not convinced.
I would say it is a good movie, but clearly not what I expertes."

","Skip to bottom for TLDR<br/><br/>Whilst i didn't think this was a horrible movie, quite the contrary it was a good film, but a horrible ""Star Trek"" film.<br/><br/>Just like in the hobbit, they have to introduce some idiotic/illogical love story. The Hobbit and LOTR lore basically elves and dwarves hated each other and would never, ever of fallen in love. Elves were beautiful beings, whilst the dwarves were not. In the Hobbit they decide to have about 4 Dwarves and the rest are basically small humans. Purely to fit this stupid love story.<br/><br/>Same in Star Trek, Spock is more human and guess what? He has a girlfriend.. PLEASE!!!
In the classic original Star Trek, Spock was basically incapable of having a girlfriend and was still learning his human emotions well into what would be considered his 50's.
Imo they completely ruined his beautiful character and everything that made him Spock. <br/><br/>Like most modern remakes, they do not make them for the fans. Knowing that the fans will automatically go to see these movies when they come out. They direct the movie at everyone else. Your mainstream society of movie goers that will watch any mindless dribble as long as it has CGI and a bit of stupid humor.<br/><br/>I thought the actors done a fantastic job considering the script. It's not their fault most of the characters were ruined, they played their parts very well.<br/><br/>I probably won't watch these movies again. But as i have said many times before. Rating this movie 1 star just says that you are beyond salty. Yes, it's a bad Star Trek film but as a movie it is still worth higher than 1 star. Again all i see is 1/10 or 10/10. People either love or hate movies there seems to be very few in between.<br/><br/>TLDR
Logically, i have given this a 6 due to it being a decent ""Action"" film. Whilst also being a horrible Star Trek film.
100% aimed at your common movie lovers that will watch anything with a bit of CGI, action, illogical love stories and stupid humor. This has become the trademark of modern remakes. They have proven to make more money as they are aimed at everyone rather than the fans that made the original movies/series a hit.
Same with books. They ruin books by changing them into stupid movies purely ignoring the fact that without the original fans. It would never of made it to the big screen in the first place."

","I am a Star Trek fan, a ST:TOS fan. And therefore I was (as many were) sceptical of a reboot of our favourite characters.<br/><br/>But from a character point of view, I think the casting was great, the dialogue fun & witty, I enjoyed the pop-corn ride and wanted more from this crew at the end of the film. In sense, this film was a resounding success, great fun, I've re-watched it a number of times, because I enjoy my time & journey with the characters. It is also surprisingly respectful of TOS.<br/><br/>There are problems - and the biggest is the plot is awful and the motivations are totally unbelievable. There is no just credible way that Spock would have been blamed for failing in a last ditch attempt to save an already doomed planet. The Romulans were never that illogical! <br/><br/>But I still rate it highly because the whole experience is just such fun!"

","I think they did a bang up job. All my favourite characters were there, played by younger actors. I very quickly accepted the new actors. They caught the essence. I choked up every time Leonard Nimoy came on screen playing the future Spock. The characters are in constant danger. I kept thinking they were done for, only perhaps to be rescued by some sort time travel paradox. But each time they concocted some crazy improbable way to rescue themselves. Very imaginative escapes.<br/><br/>Things I did not like: Romulans were much more like Klingons than Romulans. You can't change something that basic without explanation. Someone called out ""Godspeed"". All the other Star Trek adventures are relentlessly secular. There was too much boring watching spaceships shoot fireworks at each other or people shooting laser pistols at each other.<br/><br/>I burst out laughing at the Romulan spaceship like a giant hairy cockroach, another like a 1920s eggbeater. The drill for some bizarre reason was covered in giant thorns. None of this seemed plausible to me.<br/><br/>Chris Pine was meltingly handsome and charming. In future I hope he gets more kisses planted on those perfect lips of his."
"caseynicholson","10","1","2","6 August 2016"," Not Just a Great Star Trek Movie--But a Superb Film, Period!!!
","I really can't say enough good things about this movie. It's not just a great Star Trek movie--perhaps even the best of the whole lot--but it's also just a wonderful film, period. <br/><br/>The movie is a reboot of the original Star Trek series featuring the characters from the 1960's TV show turned successful film franchise. Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, Bones, Scottie--the gang's all here in this new start for a familiar series of tales. And yet while the characters and theme is rooted in fifty years of film history, it's also a fresh take on the characters and their stories.<br/><br/>Two things make that the case. First, the plot revolves around a time-traveling space opera story in which the original Spock (Leonard Nimoy reprises the role) and some antagonists from Star Trek: The Next Generation (a group of Romulans) emerge into the past to cause trouble for the parents of Captain Kirk. This sets up the main narrative of the entire film, and in doing so it also alters the course of history such that all the characters get a fresh start. Basically the idea is that the original Star Trek series is still canon, but that events just prior to the lives of the main cast has now shifted history so that they can go off and create their own new history together. Translation: everything has changed, but in a way that we can now have lots more great movies and the like starring the original characters.<br/><br/>That being the case, this movie provides us with origin stories the likes of which had never been revealed in such depth for several different characters (full disclosure: I'm a fan, but not a ""Trekkie"", so there may be similar origin stories out there that I'm not aware of). Specifically, Spock and Kirk both receive robust origin accounts--and ones that both help explain their respective histories, and also provide for a dynamic film.<br/><br/>All that having been said, the movie is crafted in a way such that it brings these two elements--the origin of the young crew and their first journey together on the Starship Enterprise, and the drama concerning the original Spock and the Romulans--together in a wonderful film. It's really an absolutely fantastic movie. The effects are out of this world (cheesy pun intended), with the space ships and the extra-terrestrial planets done extraordinarily well, along with a cast that nails the roles of every single Star Fleet member.<br/><br/>Again, I simply cannot recommend this movie enough. It's one of my all time favorites! 10/10 stars!"
"Fluke_Skywalker","8","1","2","4 January 2016"," Trek 2.0
","I know many longtime Trekkies/ers/ionados/meisters have lamented that JJ Abrams re-... whatever it is, of Trek dumbs down their beloved saga into a slick, shallow popcorn action movie. That it isn't about ""big ideas"". My response would be that they're right and they're wrong. Yes, this is a popcorn movie, in the best sense of that word. It zips along at warp speed for the entirety of its two hour runtime, with plot (not to be confused with story) often a mere flimsy sinew holding it all together, and there's no doubt that their mission here is to entertain more than it is to make you think. But the notion that somehow Trek has always been about big ideas isn't exactly true IMO. I think more accurately Star Trek was always more about big ideals, epitomized by the saga's second series (Star Trek: The Next Generation) and its subsequent films. That's certainly not to say it didn't explore that big idea territory at times, but it's never been a saga about hard science. Those aforementioned ideals (that secular humanistic bleeding heart utopianism) aren't exactly shoved in your face here the way they were in TNG, but the characters remain altruistic and they're (ideals) here, if only in the most shallow sense. It certainly retains the series' trademark optimism, though it does trade adventure for action (though to be fair that's been true of most of the Trek films).<br/><br/>Abrams' film puts the focus on character, with a sort of Cliff Notes Campbellian hero's journey aided by a rather dubious reset of the Trek canon. Make no mistake, there are countless contrivances in this film. Some large enough that they should be fatal, but they're not. At least for me. That's because this movie is just so damned fun. But it also sneaks up on you emotionally. Doubtless some of this has to do with whatever affection for these characters we bring with us, but from its tear jerking start to its rousing finale, I felt emotionally invested in this story and its characters."
"troyputland","8","1","2","9 April 2015"," Star Trek XI
","J.J. Abrams has reinvigorated and revitalised the Star Trek franchise with this witty and convoluted 11th film, breaking the cursed odd film amalgamation. Scriptwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have worked out a cunning way to keep Trek fresh for audiences old and new. The story is simple yet intricate; an alternate reality and a new time-line of events have been created due to Spock's undoing. Thus brings Chris Pine's James T. Kirk, a brash youngster that's persuaded by Bruce Greenwood's Captain Pike to join the Academy and outdo his Father's heroic actions. Events lead him to the Captain's chair of the Enterprise, where he's in charge of a group with a large personality. Quinto's (younger) Spock and Karl Urban's Bones McCoy are stand outs. Both constantly bereave Kirk for his behaviour. Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin and John Cho bring character traits we've seen before, and manage to add new spice to them as well. Star Trek XI upholds a consistent story, but the ending isn't as grand as it feels like it leads up to. Eric Bana's Romulan captain has limited potential even if his villain is intimidating. Maybe the next outing will see a more engaging brute, but for now, Abrams has hit the spot of our sci-fi needs."

","I won't be comparing this with Star Trek canon or the previous films and shows. Suffice to say this film delivers a non-stop rush of sci-fi action and special effects that is sure to satisfy anyone's thirst for the stuff.<br/><br/>The acting and characterisation of the main protagonists, Kirk and Spock, are well captured and delivered, though they are not consistently likable cadets. They bring out a lot of human qualities to the film that people can associate with. There's good chemistry and charm between them that keeps you interested throughout the roller-coaster story. The rest of the cast are serviceable but not outstanding, although Bones does a good job at injecting some world-weary cynicism and humanity to an otherwise tense plot.<br/><br/>Kirk's rise to captaincy and the relationship with his crew is actually more interesting than the heavy-handed revenge scenario that takes itself a little too seriously and tries to be too clever for its own good. Unfortunately, the elements of highbrow sci-fi become too confusing and silly and this let down the decent drama built up over the course of the film.<br/><br/>The main villain, Nero, gives the film an air of menace whenever he's around but his personality and motivations are poorly fleshed out and not rationalised very well. In essence he and his crew take the role of one-dimensional villains that receive very little screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, Star Trek does a good job at maintaining excitement and interest but at the same time delivers a flawed and unnecessarily complicated story."

I will leave that for the die-hard fans who either loved or hated this film.<br/><br/>""Star Trek,"" from 2009, shows us the young Kirk and Spock, along with Bones, Chekov, Ahura, etc. It starts out with James Kirk Sr. meeting his death in space but managing to get his pregnant wife off the ship; then it shows us the wild child James Jr., and then later as a student, coming up against Spock before they even board ship.<br/><br/>I have to say, I really enjoyed this story, as the fleet fights a Romulan time traveler, who is creating black holes to destroy the Federation planets, one by one. I think Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and the rest of the cast do an excellent job as the younger versions of the characters from the '60s TV series, with Quinto especially as a standout. And it was a kick to see Leonard Nimoy as the old Spock as well.<br/><br/>I feel there was an attempt to remain faithful to the '67 series, with Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike, and Mrs. Roddenberry, Majel Barrett, doing a voice-over.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is smart in this and the next film to focus on the relationship between Kirk and Spock. He continually brings both films back to it; in this film, it's an unsteady pairing that evolves over time.<br/><br/>The special effects are spectacular - you wouldn't expect anything less from a big Hollywood film.<br/><br/>Star Trek is a very successful franchise, much more successful, I feel, than Star Wars once the first big three films were done."

Although I probably won't go and watch all the old episodes or anything like that. This movie is a cleverly crafted gem that has space battles, building rank and trust, rivalry, tactics and time travel with a bit of awkward romance thrown in. And it all works well together. Chris Pine is good as Kirk who is this brash, reckless and overly cocky but likable protagonist. But Zachary Quinto just nailed it as Spock. The rest of the cast is good as well. This is a classic sci-fi flick that will be remembered for quite some time and isn't a wonder why it caused a bit of nerdgasm. It will be difficult for the sequel to top this one.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

He completely destroys a vintage sports car and wilfully gets into a barroom brawl, living like he has nothing to lose. Then he joins starfleet and saves the day. A hero! 7.

"dromasca","6","1","2","29 May 2013"," rewind on Star Trek
","As everybody is bracing for the second series of the new Star Trek series, I realized this is the right moment to see the first episode which somehow I missed a few years ago. I am a fan of the Star Trek TV series and movies, so there were little chances for me not to like this film. The passing of the torch from Gene Roddenberry who created the original series to J.J. Abrams makes a lot of sense to me, as I see in Abrams the successor of Roddenberry in creating science-fiction which keeps the right balance between science and fiction while adding human and in the best moments philosophical meanings to the action on screen, with an universal message that while the Universe may be infinite and the borders of knowledge just expect to be pushed further and further, the basic values that govern this Universe are the same, whatever form they wear.<br/><br/>The story in this first series of Star Trek is a prequel to where the original series started in the 60s. Same as George Lucas did with Star Wars, we are being brought to an earlier phase of the conflict between the Federation and the Romulans, and we get to know all the familiar characters of the original series at an earlier age. Rigorous science was never the strong point of Star Trek, one accepts the conventions in order to enjoy the show, so the space travel as well as hint of alternate universes Abrams likes is used here as well, and it's not necessary to analyze it too closely to find some flaws. What counts is however the way the young actors build their characters and how they drive them towards becoming what we know that they will be in the series that began back in the 60s. The effects around are pretty standard for the space wars kind of movies, and the old tricks like the 'transporter' have kind of a 'retro' look. Here lies actually part of the charm of this film, and this balances to some extent the 'teens on space ships' moments, or even the 'intergalactic sex' scene (yes, there is one, not too explicit, do not worry).<br/><br/>The presence of Leonard Nimoy as old Mr. Spock living thanks to some time travel tricks to meet his young self played by Zachary Quinto ensures continuity and connects well with the older TV series. Young captain Kirk is played by Chris Pine and I probably need to wait for the next series to see how he evolves into the character of Kirk as I remember him. A few good actors I know from TV series (Karl Urban, John Cho) add good supporting acting to the cast. Reasonable action combines well with nostalgia, but this combustible is already burnt out completely in the first episode. I hope that the coming series will find something new and interesting that speaks not only to the captive audiences like myself but also to the broader ones who were less exposed to large doses of the older Star Trek series and movies."

That's what the old Trekkies love: The discussion of technology, the moral aspects of the action.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams has thrown these base ingredients of Star Trek over board and applied only the name to a low class space-fantasy-action production. Not even the quality of the acting can cover this.<br/><br/>Even if the moral aspect can't be as prominent in an movie as in an television series, it was always there.<br/><br/>Beside that, Abrams uses ""Technology"" that is in total contradiction to current science: black holes can't be used to travel through time, they would consume everything that comes near; a matter, capable of creating a black hole out of one drop would create a black hole as soon as produced.<br/><br/>Last but not least is to consider, that the film lives a lot from it's glorious heritage and the established fandom, but not of it's own. We tend to overlook a lot of flaws in the film in favor for it's inspiring young characters.

","The Star Trek film (2009) follows the adventures of a young James Kirk, played by Chris Pine, on his path to becoming the Captain of the USS Enterprise. The story begins on the day of his birth and also shows us how the heroic actions of his father saved the lives of hundreds of people, including James and his mother, while sacrificing his own. After flash forwarding in time, we see a rebellious Kirk who does not seem to have any direction in life. A chance encounter with the Captain Pike, played by Bruce Greenwood, of the USS Enterprise encourages James to join the Star Fleet. The film takes us along the series of events that introduce the audience to many of the other key players in the previous Star Trek films such as Spock, played by Zachary Quinto, Leonard McCoy, played by Karl Urban, and Scotty, played by Simon Pegg. The events that unfold bring the group together against a common enemy, Captain Nero, played by Eric Bana, who is bent on the destruction of the entire Star Fleet. Captain Nero holds the Star Fleet responsible for the destruction of his homeworld of Romulus. Kirk must pull the group together to prevent Captain Nero from destroying Earth and the entire Star Fleet in the process. <br/><br/>While the theme of the films follows along the classic guidelines of good vs. evil, there are also some strong elements of character development present in the film much like we see in the film Batman Begins (2005). It is very interesting to see how James Kirk became the Captain of the USS Enterprise and formed such a strong bond with the other members of the crew as well. J.J. Abrams, director, does a fantastic job of introducing each of the key characters that we know and love from the previous Star Trek films and providing the audience with some addition back story for these characters in the process. The focus on character developments is part of what makes the film such a delight to watch.<br/><br/>In addition to the strong character development, the editing in the film is top notch. The pacing of the film keeps the audience on the edge of their seat and never lets up from start to finish. Even some of the less action oriented scenes are still very interesting because of how well they tie in to the overall story that is being told here. The editing of the film does an outstanding job of immersing the audience in the action that is occurring on screen. The cutting of scenes is used to great effect to set the appropriate tempo during different scenes throughout the film. The battle scenes cut back and forth between different crew members to give the audience a sense of the chaos that is occurring on screen while slow cutting is used in some of the less action oriented scenes. Overall the film never leaves the audience bored with what is happening by keeping and an excellent pace from start to finish. <br/><br/>Star Trek (2009) is an outstanding film that follows James Kirk from childhood to becoming the Captain of the USS Enterprise. The theme of the film follows the classic struggle of good versus evil while we see James Kirk mature from a rebellious young man to the captain of his own ship. The character development and excellent pacing throughout the film make Star Trek an enjoyable adventure to watch. I would strongly recommend this film to any potential viewers."

","I went into this movie wanting to like it, but by the time we cleared the opening action sequence, I already knew I was in for a rough ride.<br/><br/>I have been watching Star Trek since I was a little kid (born 1977), and from the original series, through Voyager, Star Trek has always been a step above the common sci-fi tripe out there.<br/><br/>Star Trek was NEVER about flashy special effects or laser beams blowing up planets. It has always been about HOPE and a vision of a more idyllic future. It has always embodied a sense of scientific accuracy (in varying degrees) that silly, magical universes like Star Wars or X-men do not.<br/><br/>This movie however, was a random hodgepodge of flashy effects, broken story lines (that lead nowhere), and poorly thought-out logic. Gene Roddenberry is probably turning over in his grave like he is hooked to a BBQ spit knowing this travesty was made in his honor.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams could not have done Gene over worse than if he pulled his slacks down and took a huge deuce on Gene's gravestone.<br/><br/>How in the hell does a cadet, fresh out of the academy, get put in charge of the Federation's flagship? Were there no other senior officers with at least a year of experience on board? Why was the entire ship crewed by academy graduates? What are the chances their entire graduating class gets assigned to the same ship over a swollen hand?<br/><br/>Why would they send two cadets to stop an enemy terrorist from blowing up a planet? How did we end up with a sword-fight? Is Sulu going to be wielding a light-saber in the next movie? Doesn't the Federation have a SEAL TEAM 6 or space marines or something? Two cadets in space-suits is the best the Federation can manage to save a core Federation planet?<br/><br/>They jettison crew-members onto hostile worlds for verbally disagreeing with the acting captain? Not only that, but jettison raw cadets onto hostile worlds with no training or survival tools?<br/><br/>What are the chances of being gulagged to an abandoned Hoth, and just happening to land your capsule right next to the only other persons on that planet? Why didn't Spock just walk to Scotty's base instead of hiding from Hoth Wampas in cave?<br/><br/>How come Scotty did not get court-martialled for abandoning his post on Hoth? Instead, they make him Chief Engineer of the flagship after just arriving on board...<br/><br/>Checkhov is able to operate the transporters (which used an arcade-like targeting system to further cater to the masses of jellyfish that liked this movie), but they do not have a transporter chief on board who would be more qualified to work on such a complex system than a raw cadet? ""Red matter""? Are you freaking serious? I have to agree with the other posters-- the time travel and ""red matter"" were nothing more than life-support for lazy storytelling. Omega-13? Galaxy Quest anybody?<br/><br/>Instead of having to use some artistic talent to link this storyline with the 40 years of existing ones-- JJ Abrams lobotomized approach was just ""lets scrap everything and start over"", and use time travel or ""it's just a movie"" to get it past the masses of ADHD viewers out there that just want to see hot girls and explosions, regardless of whether it actually makes sense for them to be there or not.<br/><br/>And then, the biggest problem with this movie--- the villain. He was not believable. At all. Nor did he seem very threatening either.<br/><br/>So...let me get this straight. After Spock nearly kills himself trying to save Romulus from destruction, the Romulan Darth Maul (he was so unremarkable, I can't even recall his name) decides to go on a vendetta against him? Since the black hole took the Romulan ship 25 years into the past-- wouldn't it have been smarter if the Romulans spent that time trying to warn their people and avoid the disaster?<br/><br/>For him to be mad at Spock enough to want to destroy his home world-- wouldn't that be akin to swearing revenge on a fireman who got killed trying to save your family from a burning house? Seriously, this movie was just plain AWFUL.<br/><br/>The non-existent plot was nothing more than a 2 hour excuse to introduce more explosions, laser beams, karate fighting, and cute girls onto the screen-- with no regard to plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>I am definitely not against rebooting old franchises, but at least do it gracefully, and in a way that pays respectful homage to the original, rather than desecrating it like a bunch of toddlers in a candy store.<br/><br/>Batman was a silly comic book cartoon when it first started. The recent Dark Knight made it darker, more somber, more serious, and BETTER. This stupid wreck of a movie did the exact opposite-- it took a great finished product and made a complete mockery out of it.<br/><br/>The Motion Picture and Wrath of Khan were the only two good sci-fi's out of the entire Star Trek movies collection, but this one sets the bar at an all-time low."

Yes it would have been hard to write a 'prequel' to a story that has 40 years of history... but to just throw all that history and cannon away in the opening scenes of movie was just lazy and pathetic.<br/><br/>This was NOT a Star Trek movie, regardless of what the characters names may have been.<br/><br/>Then on top of that, there were many things about the film that I found very out of place or out right annoying.

It's in almost every scene in the movie. Most directors do everything they can to AVOID lens flare and use it only as rare artistic touch.... it turns out that Abrams LOVES lens flares and actually had people shinning bright lights up into the cameras to create them when they wouldn't have been there naturally. I've come to see his love for lens flares in other films like 'Super 8'.<br/><br/>Setting my dislike of Abrams style, and the fact that he chose to simply ignore 40 years of Star Trek history, it's not a bad sic-fi/action film.... but it is NOT a Star Trek film and I doubt very much if I will bother seeing the sequel that is currently in the works.

","I have seen worse reboots, such as with the James Bond 007 franchise, for example. But what makes this reboot somewhat tolerable, as opposed to the disastrous Bond one, is that this at least does not take itself too seriously and retains more of the characterizations of the original parts.<br/><br/>This movie is action-packed, but not as frenetic as some other recent ones that employ heavy use of special effects. Although I understand the concept behind the shaky camera work and artificially induced flaring of the anamorphic lenses, they stood out as techniques and in so doing eventually became distractions. Same with the blinking lights, although that was not as ridiculous as the strobe light effects in the original Alien movie.<br/><br/>Why do film makers believe that you have to make action movies seem like video games? Although the answer is obvious, I would submit that it alienates a large portion of the viewing audience, specifically those who have not grown up with the video game experience as a big part of their entertainment history.<br/><br/>Absolutely employ any new technology and device to tell a story, but don't make the technology or device a character unto itself. That does not help tell a story.<br/><br/>There were parts of this movie that were 'fun'...and for that I applaud the film makers. The producers and directors of the Bond franchise sucked the life out of that genre by removing all the 'fun'. Guess you can tell how disappointed I still am with that decision."

Well, I was not disappointed, if anything, I was pleasantly surprised. The action, I got it, and then some. Two hours, gone in a flash. A lot of familiar faces, visually believable and beautiful even when watching on-line. It does not have the ""old"" (or ""nostalgiq"" for fans, I guess) feeling to it, in stead it's fresh, yet it does have all the familiar factors in it, so that even I (someone who has maybe seen 10 episodes in my life)can relate it to Star trek.

"dickie-uk","10","3","12","11 January 2010"," Well done J J Adams and crew!
","Blimey, this was good. On the strength of this film I consider it a pity that J J Abrams wasn't given The Lord of the Rings to bring to the screen. I've been with Star Trek from the beginning, through all its incarnations, and can only rejoice in what's been done in this movie. After the terrible let-down that was Brian Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's much loved trilogy (and here let me say that I love most of his other work), I was expecting the worst from a re-worked Star Trek, especially since I have been supremely unimpressed by Abrams' other work. Quite simply, I was blown away by this film. Chris Pine is incredibly accurate in his portrayal of a James T Kirk who came through a different, obviously more troubled, childhood and adolescence, from the Kirk portrayed by William Shatner. Zachary Quinto is almost more like Spock than Spock himself. McCoy took a few scenes to convince me, as did Chekov and Sulu, but having reviewed the original series, I'm completely won over by their portrayals; the actors picked out characteristics that were there all the time in the original, but that I'd overlooked. The only disappointment for me was Simon Pegg's Scotty. I thought at first I didn't take to him because he didn't live up to the expectation generated by early reviewers, who rated him the best thing in the movie. But, having watched it several more times, I still cannot see why people rate his portrayal so highly. I find it somewhat light-weight, and not that amusing. The new Uhura is interesting – different from the original, but probably necessarily so, given that the way women and their roles are viewed has evolved considerably since the sixties. It's a nice tweak to have Spock in a romantic relationship; in the original series several women fell for him, but rarely did he respond in kind, and only under some outside influence. One review I read on here despaired that the new Spock lost control when taunted. In the original series, given the right circumstances, he certainly became violent on occasion, and it was Kirk who knew which buttons to press. In addition, in this movie it is the elder Spock himself who points out how to provoke his younger self. In my humble opinion this is a great movie. Can't wait for the sequel."
"pjdoughnut","10","3","12","4 July 2009"," Loved every minute of it.
","I have never been into Star Trek. I loved and still do love Star Wars. However I am a big JJ Abrams fan and I liked Zachary Quinto a lot too so for these reasons alone I was interested.<br/><br/>Within the first two minutes I was enthralled.... within the first ten I had my jaw on the floor and it stayed there for the most of the movie. It seems an odd contradiction for the Lost man- a series that moves so slow to come up with such a fast paced sci fi film. It felt as if all my gripes with Star Trek were instantly fixed. One of the reasons i d never been able to get into Star Trek was the characters- they seemed too distant - too remote somehow to root for. Another thing about Star Trek is the ridiculous techno babble and the fact that it seems sometimes so boring and very little to do with space adventuring at all... I always thought that the opening sequences of the Star Trek series were great- vast vistas of space and planets- it created a real sense of wonder and awe - and then the show would start and it would be 4 actors in a room talking a load of balls. With Abrahms Star Trek this is nt the case. The character s of Kirk and Spock are conflicted and both in their own way rebellious. The opening is breathtaking and the wow factor is maintained throughout the film. This could not be boring if it tried. Yet as good as the action is the core of the film is about the character s and their struggles which I think a lot of other blockbuster films such as Transformers miss. Also another thing I found offputting about Star Trek originally was the po faced ness of it all. Yet Abrahms Star Trek has many great comedic moments that help lighten the tone without going over the top. The tone of the film I loved - it was optimistic and bucked the trend of dark and gloomy blockbusters. Don't get me wrong I love those too- but Star Trek felt genuinely entertaining in a way that few recent blockbusters have managed to do. There were flaws - the story does fall apart on close inspection, and the bad guy Nero was way underused. But it s to Star Trek s credit that I really did nt notice or care too much, I was having so much fun with this movie. Even though I am no Star Trek fan I am glad that Abrahms managed to side step the usual reboot trap by setting it in an alternate timeline. This will mean hopefully old Trekkies will still like it. There seemed to be lots of lines that Trekkies<br/><br/>were supposed to recognise - not being a Star Trek fan i did nt of course but I m sure the Die Hard Trekkies would get a kick out of those.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie and I have to admit that I wish the Star Wars Prequels could have been this funny and entertaining."

","I went into this knowing that it wasn't the Star Trek I'd grown up watching in reruns. This movie has its own look and style that gave me goosebumps. I didn't know that a starship could have so many pipes and valves in it. <br/><br/>The first scene was very emotional. George Kirk had to pilot the Kelvin manually while his wife was in labor. I could feel the tears in my eyes as I realized that that brave man would never see his son grow up. And James Kirk being born on a ship instead of in Iowa was just the first of the divergences from the traditional Star Trek canon. The scene where he stole a vintage Corvette and drove it off a cliff was a real nail-biter, although it's kind of nice to know that the Beastie Boys' music will survive into the 23rd century.<br/><br/>The second most shocking moment for me was watching Vulcan implode. I was speechless, and I was angry at the bad guys for committing such an atrocious act.<br/><br/>The MOST shocking moment for me was finding out that Spock and Uhura had a romantic relationship going on. That really blew my mind. That being said, all in all, there was enough action and emotion to satisfy any Star Trek fan. <br/><br/>One last thing and I'll be going: This old warhorse still has some fight left in her and I, for one, am looking forward to any future entries in this alternate Trek reality."

","Honestly, there is nothing bad I can say about this film. But what struck me those most was not the stellar visuals, nor the superbly cast characters. No, it was the musical score that made this movie wonderful! Michael Giacchino's out-of-this world soundtrack truly transports you into this film, and makes you feel every single cosmic minute. It grabs you from the opening sequence, quietly but dramatically, before diving head-first into a familiar, but not so familiar, interstellar scene.<br/><br/>The main theme, entitled 'Enterprising Young Men,' is easily the beating heart of this musical adventure. It encapsulates every exciting emotion that is evoked by such stunning visuals, that simply cannot be expressed in words, only felt and experienced. After the main theme, the next greatest song is 'Labor of Love,' a stirringly quiet yet gripping moment in music where one can actually feel the pains of love, loss, and labor's yet to come.<br/><br/>In short, 'Star Trek' is a true Space Opera of the first order! When you see it next, just sit back and listen to this true cinematic masterpiece of a score. I guarantee that you've never heard anything like it!"
"freemantle_uk","9","3","12","29 May 2009"," There is only one J.J. Abrams!
","J.J. Abrams had done it, he actually made Star Trek exciting compared to all the other Trek media that has existed before hand. This is the Star Trek film for all non-Trekkies, including myself.<br/><br/>After the success of the prequels/re-boots of Batman and James Bond, Hollywood wonder boy J.J. Abrams suggested the same treatment for Star Trek which had become no more then an object of parody in shows like Futurama and films like Galaxy Quest. Abrams has just kick-started the franchise.<br/><br/>In a alternative time-line a Romulan spaceship travels back in time and attacks a Federation ship. George Kirk sacrifices himself and saves 800, including his wife and new-born son James (Chris Pine). The film fast forwards and focuses on both James and Spock (Zachary Quinto), who rebels in there own way. James gets involved in petty crime and fights, whilst Spock is discriminated against because he is half-human and joins Star-fleet to prove a point. James Kirk was recruited by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenway), who knew his father. Whilst in the training academy and working on USS Enterprise Kirk and Spock entered into conflict and took a dislike to each other. Spock dislikes Kirk's attitude acting before thinking and rebelling against orders, whilst Kirk dislikes Spock's cold and heart-less way of working. The USS Enterprise is called into action after Vulcan, Spock's home planet, is attacked by the Romulans. Captain Nero (Eric Bana), hates Spock, blaming him for the destruction of his home planet. He sets out to destroy Vulcan and Earth. After the destruction of Vulcan and capture of Captain Pike, both Kirk and Spock wrestle for command of the Enterprise.<br/><br/>What J.J. Abrams does is treat Star Trek as an action film. The action is exciting, and done with great CGI and editing. It makes Star Trek a good watch. He makes the film a bit like Star Wars with the style of space based action, to fights with the Romulans, to the different types of alien species. The scenes at the academy also reminded me of the good film Starship Troopers. Abrams wanted to make Star Trek accessible to non-Trekkies and does it by restarting with the characters and the world it was set in. There is a good cast. Chris Pine is an up-and-comer in Hollywood, who plays Kirk as an arrogant kid but at the same time does have a charge in impersonate William Shatner. Zachary Quinto is famous from Heroes and does well as the cold Spock. Karl Urban from Lord of the Rings, is good as Kirk's friend Bones. Simon Pegg is given too little screen time as Scotty. The excellent Eric Bana does well as the villain and Zoe Saldana is a good choice for Uhuru, both as an actress and looks wises.<br/><br/>The film is basically a set up for the new franchise, much like X-Men and Batman Begins were; but it is cleverly written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (Alias, Transformers, The Island). They use science fiction, action and comedy well. There are some in-jokes I didn't get but Trekkies will like it.<br/><br/>The film did drag some times and get a little slow. I also did not like Anton Yelchin's comedic Russian accent (which is surprising seeing he is from a Russian background). I thought we had moved on from the 60s where taking the mike of the Russians was more acceptable.<br/><br/>But the film is exciting and gripping from it first moments.<br/><br/>3 out of 5."

I never really got into to them very much and even watching the original Star Trek I still wasn't much of a fan, but after seeing this movie I definitely am.<br/><br/>J.J.

Giving us an in depth look at the origins of one of the most popular T.V. Series of all time. This film does to the Star Trek series what X-Men Origins: Wolverine did for the X-Men series, it gives us a starting point, something to work from, something for fans to see how these famous character's came to be. And for people who have never seen the series, it gives them something to start with. It gives them a chance to experience a movie that is literally out of this world. Star Trek is a space tripping, mind blowing Sci-Fi adventure that is something all long time Trekkie's and non-fan's alike can enjoy and love.

"Superunknovvn","7","3","12","27 May 2009"," Very entertaining... and this is coming from a non-Trekkie!
","Apart from the classic 60's TV show, which i enjoyed as a little kid, ""Star Trek"" never appealed to me. I'm not really a science-fiction-fan to begin with, and I find most of Gene Roddenberry's universe (or what was added to it later on) rather lofty and plain nerdy.<br/><br/>However, I've heard good things about this re-boot of the franchise, so I gave it a shot. I didn't regret it. J.J. Abrams (or whoever is really responsible for the outcome of this) did a fine job of looking for the things that are actually fun about ""Star Trek"": space battles, adventures on unknown planets with horrific monster and also a nice dose of comedy.<br/><br/>The casting choices are nothing short of inspired. Chris Pine captures that lumbering charm of William Shatner perfectly. Zachary Quinto moves his eye brow exactly like Leonard Nimoy did and turns Spock into something of a hunk. Uhura is sexier than ever, Bones is grumpy as always and Scotty... well, I'm a fan of Simon Pegg, but I wasn't really sure why all of a sudden Scotty was a stand-up comedian. The important thing is that the characters and all their connections to one another were set up properly while never letting the fun factor slip away. We get to see why Bones is always holding a grudge against Spock, how Kirk managed to become Captain even though he is something of a slacker and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>A few things might turn true Trekkies off. There is very much slapstick. It never becomes a parody of ""Star Trek"", but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which as a non-fan I enjoyed a lot. However, if you spend every second weekend at a ""Star Trek""-convention in your favorite Clingone-costume, you may hate that approach.<br/><br/>Also, the writers added a couple of things like Uhura becoming Kirk's and Spock's (wtf??) love interest or the whole ""alternate timeline""-storyline (I'm still not sure if that made a whole lotta sense, but whatever).<br/><br/>The point is, that this movie is not over-thinking every detail, but it concentrates on characters, funny one-liners, comedic timing and action - and that makes it the very first thoroughly enjoyable ""Star Trek""-movie."

","I will try not to spoil anything with my simple opinion. This is from of one who has grown up watching the show and most of the movies.<br/><br/>First of all it is more than just the flashiness. It is a very beautiful movie but the only time I remember ever thinking about is during the middle action sequence.<br/><br/>Three things that made the movie for me: the acting, the humor, and the plot.<br/><br/>Acting- The acting was spot on. Karl Urban as Bones was so much like Kelly (the original doctor) that I remember everyone laughing in the theater just because he was so good. Quinto as Spock was a very good casting choice, though he can't beat good old Nimoy. Pine was equally good but never really felt like Kirk until the third act, but that was explained in the movie. As for everyone else, not one person was underused or wrong for the part.<br/><br/>Humor- One of the best things in this movie. The fast plot it broken up by lots of humor. Some people may not like the slapstick, but, as one who usually doesn't like it, I laughed at all of it. Simon Pegg was great as Scotty, bringing in a little joy just like the show.<br/><br/>Plot- The most important part to a movie was nailed. It isn't perfect but I loved it too much to care. I didn't understand the love between Uhura and Spock. Nero, the villain, should have been developed a little more; I still like him as a villain however. You will find it takes from the second Star Trek movie a lot, which I find a good thing. It also takes from Star Wars a lot. For example there is the theme of destiny and coming-of-age which was never in regular Star Trek. There are a lot of heavy themes in this movie such as friendship, revenge, the value of being human, and hope in darkness; all Star Trek themes I have grown up loving. Best of all you see Kirk and Spock grow. Plus, Nimoy had an important narrative role.<br/><br/>I hope this review is helpful, and I hope this movie will make you love the series as much as I do."

On our way home, my daughter and I couldn't stop discussing the film, the actors, the effects. Sadly I am old enough to remember watching the original series and I agree there may be plot holes when you compare it with the original series or the other films, but for God's sake, is it not possible for some of you to sit and watch a movie and just enjoy it as a stand alone film for its own sake?

(I've also been a Shatner/Captain Kirk freak, but that comes in later.)<br/><br/>I had horrible trepidations about this movie. I didn't think that anyone would be able to bring back the characters or, especially (as Harve Bennett said) bring back their ability to ""tap dance"" in tune with the plot and each other.<br/><br/>But, but gosh, JJ Adams did it. He recreated Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, and all the other characters we loved in the original series, although with slight twists. They have a slightly different taste than before but it still fits. The banter -- especially, of course, from McCoy -- is still a hot. The adventure and action still holds you tight, and the end is right (sorta -- but I'm not going to give that away).<br/><br/>The Great Bird of the Galaxy (for non-Trekkers, Gene Roddenberry), if he was still alive, would have approved and applauded.

I've found something to love about each and every incarnation of Star Trek, including this one.<br/><br/>Fans like me have already dissected this movie, exposing all of its continuity problems with the normal Star Trek universe history. The movie itself even advises you to disregard all that you know about the continuity of the series. And why not? It's good to see a fresh take on old familiar characters and situations.<br/><br/>Speaking of fresh takes on old characters, each of the actors playing the old Star Trek crew we've grown to know and love does an exceptional job. I felt that the strongest performances were given by Chris Pine as James T. Kirk, and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock. Chekov, Sulu, McCoy, Scotty and Uhura are also well represented here.<br/><br/>Leonard Nimoy's ""final"" appearance as Spock (the credits call him Spock Prime, and I'll believe it was his final appearance when I see a Trek movie without him) was fitting.

We also see the early beginnings of the Vulcan savant Spock (""Heroes"" Zachary Quinto).

It's a visual feast boasting top-of-the-line special effects and acting from/for the next generation of Trekkies.

Abrams has had some choice words for Trekkies in the weeks leading up to the film's release, but seemed to have quieted some fears by at least casting Leonard Nimoy in a brilliant (not to mention highly welcome) cameo in his immortal role as original Spock.<br/><br/>This ""Star Trek"" boldly goes where no man has gone before, and that is a great summer at the movies.<br/><br/>9/10"

You Star Trek fans out there decrying this movie for it's lack of political, philosophical and sociological commentary are every bit the dickheads that Leonard Nimoy called you on Saturday Night Live. You just cant deal emotionally with the fact that this movie is actually just as exiting and thrilling as Star Trek's greatest rival which of course has been Star Wars. In case you unrepentant nerds didn't notice Star Wars has always pretty much been considered mainstream entertainment while Star Trek pretty much has NOT. This is in spite of the great rating for TNG, DS9 and Voyager. Quite frankly, all you so called fans out there who hate this movie just because it has more excitement that your wussy souls can deal with are mostly just a bunch of nerdy losers just like Shatner made your out to be on SNL. Why don't get down off your sickening left wing high horse and just become normal human beings for once and you might actually be able to chill out enjoy this movie. You only know how to make yourself feel intellectually superior to others by emotionally puffing yourself up all the time with things that are filled with endless philosophical and sociological dribble drabble. The famous Star Trek technobabble, I'm sad to say, has also often served this same purpose because it makes you feel falsely like your somehow ""smarter"" than everyone else when in fact it doesn't teach your a damm thing that even really matters. Personally I'm happy that J.J. Abrams in this movie not only ditched the technobabble but ditched all of the other sociological dribble drabble as well. This isn't the 1960's anymore. If your want something with sixties like sociological perspective then watch the original series again until your blue in the face. Just leave the rest of us alone who just want Paramount to do whatever it takes to save the Star Trek franchise and who just love watching really great entertainment like this. This movie was as close to the original vision from the 1960's as your can get while still being updated for the 21st century. For Christ's sake it even still has mini-skirts in it and a whole ton of other tidbits right out of the original series and that still isn't good enough for some of you people who would still prefer that the Enterprise sets still be made out of cardboard. In fact, only real nerds would make some of the insane comments I've seen on here including a comment by one idiot claiming to be a fan and yet saying at the same time that he hoped that this film would bomb and not make any money. In case this one particular moron didn't notice Star Trek has had a VERY hard time for 40 years being considered any type of mainstream entertainment. We just couldn't afford another bomb out like Star Trek: Nemesis just so all of your ""hard core"" fans who want to stay stuck in the 1960's could still remain in your pathetic little nerdy left wing world. That's a world where the only ""good"" Star Trek is supposed to be something that resembles a political science class with an arrogant left wing, socialist/secular humanist professor who keeps babbling on forever until you cave in at last and are ready to take a copy of Das Kapital in hand and start you own new red revolution. The Next Generation had enough of that type of left wing anti-capitalist garbage and thank god it was all left out of this awesome and enjoyable re-boot. Thank you J.J Abrams for not cow-towing to all of Star Trek's wonderfully loyal ""hard core"" fans who apparently would have been happier if this movie had bombed out by being filled with two hours of boring sociological and political commentary instead of something exiting and thrilling for a change!"

","They did it with Star Wars, X-Men, and Underworld. And now they done with Star Trek, going back to the early days of the original crew from the 60's T.V. show.<br/><br/>It shows the early days of James T.

If you are an idiot or don't pay attention, then you might not understand the plot. If you are an intelligent person who listens to the dialog, you will understand the plot.<br/><br/>The entire theater in the afternoon showing I was in today broke into applause as soon as the closing credits started to roll. That doesn't happen much anymore. I'm not sure if I have personally been in a theater where that happened since Star Wars original run.<br/><br/>I'm not going to rehash the plot, and you shouldn't read any who do if you are planning to see the movie.<br/><br/>Suffice it to stay that this movie grabs you for a tense ride from the first scene and barely gives you a chance to catch your breath for two hours. I was exhausted at the end of it, and as a 43 year Star Trek fan, had my eyes water up a time or two, especially when the Alexander Courage theme broke out at the end and the Star Trek voice over began.<br/><br/>This is the first movie in many years I will go to see again in the theater, maybe more than once again. We're already anxiously awaiting the Blu-ray release!!! Go and enjoy. You won't get a chance to relax, and you'll love that.<br/><br/>Star Trek lite fans who don't get this, just shut up and go watch the TOS DVDs until you know enough to be allowed in."

","Let's just say I went to my first Star Trek convention in the late 70's. I have been greatly disappointed with some of the Star Trek movies the past. However, this so-called re-boot is amazing. One could not ask for a better one. It does make many references to the original TV series and some of the movies. But non-trekkers will not notice t hem, most importantly these reference do not slow the movie down. This is warp driven Star Trek for a new generation of fans. It embodies the spirit of the original, but it much more fast paced. The new cast has great chemistry, and leave you wanting more. If only they had those effects in the 1960's."
"cchase","9","3","12","9 May 2009"," Back At Full (Warp) Speed...
","When it was first announced that J.J. Abrams (LOST, FRINGE) was being handed the keys to the Roddenberry kingdom, I couldn't have felt more trepidation. LOST had me in its grip until about the end of the second season, when things started to get way too ""TWIN PEAKS-ish"" for me and I bailed out. Ditto with FRINGE, which just managed to escape the pitfalls of becoming ""X-FILES ULTRA PLUS."" <br/><br/>But damned if they didn't manage it. Abrams, writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci and producer Damon Lindelof have turned out to be the ""vitamin B-12 complex"" shot that this ailing series needed in its behind parts, and they have done it while still remaining mostly true to the characters and ideals held dear by devoted fans everywhere. Best of all, because of the way it has been cleverly written and directed, you need not have seen a single frame of any of the many entries in the franchise to appreciate what Team Abrams hath wrought. <br/><br/>The casting is dead solid perfect. Chris Pine is the exact combination of bravado, recklessness fueled by a testosterone overload and the unflappable courage of feckless youth we knew that James Tiberius Kirk was in his younger days. Not one time does he hit a false note, and the ""Shatnerisms"" are completely avoided (until a certain point...you'll know when that is, but by then, you won't even mind.)<br/><br/>HEROES' Zachary Quinto and THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK'S Karl Urban are nothing less than astonishing as the younger Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy, respectively. Both actors avoid imitating their predecessors as well, and both deliver skillful performances without turning into the SNL caricatures we were afraid they would be. Urban is especially unexpected, capturing the physicality, the vocal inflections and the mindset of the great DeForest Kelly's performance in what can only be described as a loving tribute to the character. And Quinto should be ready to kiss his TV career as the chimerical Gabriel Sylar goodbye. The impression he leaves here as Spock will find him facing all the good and bad aspects of being associated with such an icon of the series. <br/><br/>One would hope he already discussed this with the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, who well into his twilight years, can still hold our rapt attention on-screen, and plays a pivotal part in the storyline of this new alternate version. The moments he shares with the key members of the youthful cast are both energizing and poignant with their symbolic importance. You can almost see the torch being passed again, into very capable hands. <br/><br/>As the beautiful and brainy Uhura, Zoe Saldana does Nichelle Nichols proud as her new incarnation, and I hope the revered singer/actress is flattered, because Saldana really brings it, completely unfettered by the chauvinism that hog-tied so many of the strong and capable females featured in the canon back during its inception. <br/><br/>John Cho (HAROLD AND KUMAR), Simon Pegg (SHAUN OF THE DEAD) and Anton Yelchin round out the principal cast as Sulu, Scotty and Chekhov respectively. Though they are given woefully little to do compared to the leads, (and this really is more about Kirk and Spock than anyone else), each makes the most of the moment they were given to shine. I kind of had my doubts about Yelchin as Chekhov first because of the accent that veers dangerously into stand-up comedian territory, but if one thinks back to Walter Koenig creating the role, you realize that the accent didn't sound all that convincing at first then, either. <br/><br/>Plus, for lovers of the vital secondary characters important in the lives of the core characters, as well as serial movie buffs who love to play ""name that actor"", there are plenty of juicy surprises that I will not reveal here. I do need to mention the outstanding performance of Eric Bana as the villain of this particular piece, the deranged and inconsolable Romulan captain Nero. A little more time should have been given to this character to give us deeper insight into his motivation, so that his evil deeds are given even more chilling and despicable power, thereby making our heroes' actions that much more noble.<br/><br/>There are plenty of nods to TREK folklore and insular references that die-hard fans will lap up like Ben and Jerry's, and the tag lines that certain characters are known for that will elicit applause and delighted laughter as they should. <br/><br/>I have not been this excited about the success of a TREK-themed film since the very first time I saw WRATH OF KHAN, and this is definitely on par with that installment, considered by many to be the best TREK sequel ever made. Which brings to mind the one key thing to remember here - this is not a sequel, or a ""reimagining"" or even a prequel. Much in the spirit of what Chris Nolan did with BATMAN and Richard Donner achieved with SUPERMAN, this is a new lease on life for an old friend.<br/><br/>I have heard the tag-line ""This is not your father's STAR TREK,"" used to the point where it should drive me to complete distraction bordering on insanity. But I can't think of a more apt way to describe it. <br/><br/>There was only two ways this project could go, warts and all - it could become a complete and utter failure, very close to the ill-advised ENTERPRISE series, or it could be that once- in-a-great while success that blows the doors off everyone's expectations.<br/><br/>So which is it? To use a horse-racing reference, Team Abrams' new entry is the ""Mine That Bird"" of the franchise. <br/><br/>It's official, folks. STAR TREK is back - full ahead, maximum warp speed!"

","I was so impressed with the way everything was handled. Normally, reboots are iffy, often unsatisfactory. This one, however, maintained the flavor of the original yet managed to open up an entire new world of potential for the franchise.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting to be as wowed as I was by the casting, in particular, yet (with the exception of Chekov's hair (!)) I thought the new people were terrific.<br/><br/>The action, the effects: marvelous.<br/><br/>Spock's emotionality was appropriate to a young Spock, finding his way. In the OS, he actually smiled, displayed emotion and so on. While that passed in the concentration on the mature Spock, fount of wisdom and advice, it should be expected that, when he first came to Starfleet, he had not yet perfected his mien of emotionlessness. It fit the stage at which the character was presented to us.<br/><br/>Insofar as the death of Amanda and the (shocking, to be sure) implosion of Vulcan go, we are dealing with a redirection of the unfolding events, therefore, changes--some disturbing and surprising--have to be included. You can't have history changed while everything you know and are comfortable with remains the same. That would negate the purpose of what this movie was trying to do.<br/><br/>I was eminently satisfied and would not hesitate to give a very high rating to the quality and presentation of this movie."
"tomhardesty-1","8","3","12","9 May 2009"," Speaking as someone who has only seen one or two episodes from the original series
","I was never really a fan of the TV series but having just watched the film, I think I need to start watching it. I didn't know much about any of the characters other than Spock and Scotty, so I was quite unprepared but the film does a great way of introducing the characters so that everyone has a chance to understand everything.<br/><br/>The film is amazing. All the actors do a great job thanks to a great script. The story is easy to get too grips with and it has a lot of depth. The special effects are incredible and they truly deserve an Oscar. A lot of the CGI shots leave you in awe thanks to some great cinematography. The lens flare effects in the film really added to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The only negatives that I can think of is that I wish Nero had more screen time as there was a lot of depth to his character and the film could have focused on that more. Eric Bana did a fantastic job as Nero and you really get a sense that his character has been through a lot in the past.<br/><br/>Other than that the film is amazing. I highly recommend it. Just make sure to watch it at a big screening that has LOUD speakers to get the full effect!"
"RCWjr","9","3","12","9 May 2009"," Makes you appreciate the original series again
","The best thing that can be said about the new Star Trek movie is that finally, after several Star Trek series inceptions and, in later years, sub-par movies, we are finally given a Trek which makes us appreciate the original series again. The film takes us through a ""what if"" scenario, much like something the original series would have done. Back in force is the humanity of the franchise that I feel had long been forgotten in the later movies and the varying new series.<br/><br/>All of the cast are fantastic here. Nobody does any mimicking, instead, they take the characters we all know and love and they stay true to how they were portrayed. Pine never resorts to Shatner's delivery (though he does do a bit at the end as a homage no doubt) as is the case with all of the other cast members. Urban is probably the closest of anyone to channeling the characterization created by the original ""Bones"", Deforest Kelly. Urban is every bit the cantankerous doctor we all love and remember. Again, this can be said of everyone. Zoe Saldana actually rises above the previous incarnation of ""Uhura"" and brings to life a full on character that Nichelle Nichols would be proud of.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's ""Scotty"" makes his appearance midway into the film and if there is any negative I can throw at the film is his late appearance, though his introduction is a fun one. Cho and Yeltin bring new appreciation for our old friends ""Sulu"" and ""Chekov"" respectively. Eric Bana's ""Nero"" is totally unrecognizable. This helps keep us in this universe, as does the fact that the majority of the main players are known, but not so well known actors that their real life persona overshadows the character they play. Quinto's ""Spock"" is every bit of the logical thinker, yet fused with an emotional element, that Nimoy created originally. There is a new relationship ""Spock"" is involved in that I am sure will have Trek fans talking about for many months to come. <br/><br/>All of the characterization asides, this film works or fails based on the relationship being built between Pine's ""Kirk"" and Quinto's ""Spock. This is the beginning of their relationship and it must plant the seed for what will be a lifetime of adventures that culminate with the famous line ""you have been and always shall be, my friend."" The film and the actors succeed in spades. <br/><br/>My only major complaint about the film would be the music. I felt it lacked a true ""theme"" and was pretty underwhelming throughout the film. We are given an update to the original series' theme, but even that seems to be less than effective when compared to the original. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams should be applauded for taking a beloved set of characters and breathing new life into them and the franchise which had sadly seemed to of ran its course. All of the characters have been written and performed with a renewed life and enthusiasm. Each character is imbued with more power in their respective positions within the ship. Abrams has pulled off the almost impossible; giving us hope that once again our beloved crew of the U.S.S Enterprise can ""boldly go where no man has gone before."""

","I have seen all the TV shows, I have watched all the movies, read all the books and comics. I Love Star Trek. I always have. Only been to one convention in my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. This movie was, without a doubt, one of the best things I have seen on the screen in a long time, if not ever. It had all the aspects of Star Trek that I needed, and all the aspects of a great Sci-fi Action Movie that I require. The humor was spot on, the characters portrayed brilliantly in my mind. To tell the truth, from the moment I heard they were going to remake this movie, I was a little nervous. But I didn't need to be, because this was a masterpiece. (SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW) Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those Trek fans who needs to nit-pick every little plot point for the sake of continuity. I never have been. After reading the message boards for this movie on here, some ""Trekkies"" seem to have a big problem with this alternate time-line. I personally do not have a problem with it at all. I also think that it makes perfect sense to do what they did, in changing the time-line. This way, for future sequels, they are not tied to Star Trek canon. The movies can now be surprising and different, without ""Trekkies"" whining that they can't do that, cause it didn't happen that way. All the whining about Vulcan being destroyed is moot as well. They didn't kill off the Vulcans, as Spock said in the movie, there are at least 10,000 of them left, and the original Spock said at the end they were going to set up a new Vulcan colony on a new planet. Also with all of the emotions that the new Spock showed in this movie, I truly think they were just coming to grips with the character and I doubt that he will be exuding as much emotion in the sequels. Spock's logic and emotional control are what define him. Also, the scenes between the original Spock and Kirk on the frozen planet were touching and sensitive in a way only Leonard Nimoy could have done. I was almost brought to tears when he told Kirk ""I have been and always shall be, your friend"" Of course I'm also the guy who was brought to tears by seeing Admiral McCoy talking to Data on the first episode of The Next Generation. So now I guess I am just rambling. In conclusion, and as I probably already said, this movie is at the top of my list for favorite movies of all time. I was on the edge of my seat with excitement throughout, laughing at the wonderful lines by the new people people playing characters I have revered for a lifetime. If I had a criticism for this movie, it would only be that I didn't want it to end."
"javaman-7","9","3","12","8 May 2009"," Mr. Sulu, take us to the sequel
","Java Man Reviews ""Star Trek"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2009.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>J. J. Abrams and his film-making team have taken the legendary Star Trek franchise back to its origins, to a point even before the TV series had its debut in 1966. Like James Bond and Casino Royale, the narrative reveals how familiar characters were forged by the fires of experience. For example, Kirk (Pine) began as a rebellious Iowa farm boy, Spock (Quinto) a conflicted (and emotional!) half-breed, Uhura (Saldana) a linguistic genius, and McCoy (Urban) a divorced intern who was left with nothing but his bones. Chekov, Sulu and Scotty (Yelchin, Cho & Pegg) also have intriguing back stories that plausibly project into the characters we remember from the series. <br/><br/>After some initial rough going, including a bitter rivalry between Spock and Kirk, the crew eventually finds itself on board the Enterprise in hot pursuit of the Romulan villain, Nero (Bana), who is destroying Federation planets in revenge for his own planet's demise. Nero is from another time, and his nemesis is a future version of Spock (Nimoy). By the end of the action, the familiar scene is set, as Kirk and his crew return to the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. <br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs<br/><br/>When Gene Roddenberry introduced Star Trek TV series over 40 years ago, he created a universe full of fascinating characters and situations, along with lots of action and adventure. He also mixed in imaginative ideas about literature, religion, philosophy, and what it is to be human (or any other life form). For fans of the series, the characters he created are indelible. What this film is tasked with doing is to recreate these characters with a new generation of actors, each of whom must channel their originals in such a way that fans find it plausible. (Yeah, that could be James T. Kirk, as a preteen leading an Iowa state trooper on a merry chase in a ""borrowed"" corvette.) <br/><br/>Though the appearance of Nimoy as the elder Spock does help tie the generations together, it will take the next edition of the series before we find out how well the filmmakers have done. Will the writing and characterization rise to the level of Roddenberry's genius? We can only hope.<br/><br/>For non-Trekkies and Star Wars fans, there is plenty for you too. The film holds up quite well as a Sci-Fi thriller with a warp-speed storyline, a suitably sinister villain, stunning visuals, lots of attractive future stars and not a few laughs.<br/><br/>Mr. Sulu, take us to the sequel."
"DoctorBaltar","Null","3","12","8 May 2009"," It's official: Star Trek is in good hands
","I just got back from Star Trek. I said I would come to this with an open mind and I did. My conclusion in a nutshell?: The critics have it right, the purists have it wrong.<br/><br/>First, let me just say that if you absolutely abhor fast paced action, suspense, and adventure, you will be disappointed. Because this thing is packed to the gills with it! This is far and away the most suspenseful Star Trek there ever was and J.J. Abrams pulls it off expertly. In fact, that and the flawless comedy were my favorite aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: This is an ORIGIN film. That's the biggest drag on this movie, as far as I'm concerned. Origin stories/movies are never very interesting. The fact that J.J. Abrams and company can turn a normally dull and drab origin story into something entertaining is a testament to his craft. I'll tell you right now, throwing in a lot of suspense and action and comedy to boot into the mix is and was the only possible way the Director and writers could have made this movie entertaining. Otherwise, I could guarantee you that it would have been a flop much like the first Star Trek Motion Picture. So the fact that J.J. Abrams effectively used these tools to gin up the story was a very wise thing to do.<br/><br/>I think I now understand why Ebert gave this movie a mixed review. Much like Spock is a hybrid Human/Vulcan, this Star Trek is a hybrid between Star Trek and Star Wars. I think Ebert is one of those old fogies who only wants it one way or the other. However, unlike Ebert, I have absolutely no problem with it. I like both styles to begin with and turning it into a hybrid of sorts makes it completely unique. A lesser director would have failed miserably at combining the two, but J.J. Abrams effectively melds the two together so that it seems like both parts naturally belong in this new Star Trek universe.<br/><br/>Finally, the purists should thank their lucky stars that J.J. Abrams made such a great film. This is going to light a fire under the Star Trek franchise like you wouldn't believe! And by the end, it was VERY Star Treky. I can almost see the new and interesting adventures this newly minted crew will experience beyond the origin. The sequel to this feels like it's going to be even better and more interesting. I can't wait.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing. The acting was absolutely SUPERB in this movie. The young actors did an exceptional job. Unlike the prequels to Star Wars that had the worst wooden acting I've seen, the actors in this movie disappear into their roles allowing me to truly enjoy the story. Their comic timing was flawless, as well.<br/><br/>Go see it, already!"
"zombierob2458","9","3","12","8 May 2009"," Boldly goes where no Star Trek has gone before.
","A great reboot of the franchise. Like Casino Royale was to the bond series this movie is a breath of fresh air into a long time fan favorite established universe. It gives inside nods to long time fans of the material yet is a brand new starting point for those unfamiliar with the universe. I consider myself a star trek fan and actually had high hopes for this film(unlike many trekkies). When it started I was a little sceptical but as the film played out I was hooked. Nero is the best trek baddie since khan and the cast is perfect. The special effects are outstanding. Visually there has never been a trek like this. The stand out to me is Pine as Kirk. The rest of the cast stays pretty close to the original characters(especially urban as Mccoy who is spot on Deforest Kelly)but pine took the roll and ran with it. He's a mix between Han-solo and Kirk. He's a ladies man, a tough guy and eventually a leader. Quinto took some getting used toas Spock(he doesn't have that signature voice that Nemoy had)but he really nailed it by the end. Scotty and Chekov are comic relief, Uhura is sexy and intelligent(she's actually a multi-layered established character unlike in the show) and Bana is awesome as Nero. Like I stated previously Nero is a legitimate villain unlike many of the previous film bad guys hes not over the top or unthreatening. Star trek movies in many ways have suffered from poor antagonists(like highlander with the exception of Kurgan... who cares)but Nero is a badass. Its fun seeing a big budget star trek with a great cast. Its fun seeing the characters we love evolve before our eyes. This film has its faults to be sure but it is a fun sci-fi adventure that is a blast to see. The battles explode across the screen and the story is a perfect homage to the original series. It actually feels like it could have been an episode from the show. I will be seeing it again as should everyone trek fan or not."

The characters are very well portrayed by the actors. Kirk is such an annoying jerk who happens to be cool at the same time, while Spock is originally calm and calculating until he embraces his emotions. Sulu, Uhura,Chekov, McCoy, and Scott really take parts on the story instead of being just as supporting characters. The film keeps the humor going on until the end, and the ending is just classic. It is also the first apocalyptic film that takes place in San Francisco without destroying the Golden Gate bridge.<br/><br/>Trekkies and non-trekkies will enjoy this film"

I know they were messing around with black holes and what not but Spock's mom is very much alive well after the crew joins and Kirk is in command.<br/><br/>But, Overall, Excellent movie. The cast members were thought out very well, without going over the top. Scotty and Bones nailed it. Chris Pine did an excellent job at playing Young Kirk and I look forward to a sequel to this prequel.<br/><br/>The Romulan's amused me somewhat with being Bald and tattoos all over their heads and didn't really captivate me as much as in the Original Series, with them being closely related to Vulcan.<br/><br/>Also, Vulcan is destroyed? I never knew this in the original timeline. I'm just tyring to figure out is with all the playing around with black holes and traveling through to the past is this the real reason for the continuity problems?"

","All kinds of awesome. I cried, I laughed, I was on the edge of my seat. Sure the plot is a little coincidence strewn, but when it comes down to it, so what? If it was perfect it would probably be so awesome that it would cause some sort of collapse in the space-time continuum and destroy the universe, and we can't have that. Pretty much everyone was really good with the possible exception of Yelchin as Chekov, a touch too young and a touch too Wesley Crusher (not his fault as an actor). Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana were all perfect and John Cho was pretty damn good too. Karl Urban had a slight fakeness to him, as if he was imitating rather than being the character. Simon Pegg took Scotty in a direction that suited him better than a straight copy and it worked. Now let's just hope they keep this quality up for the sequels."

","Star Trek is a franchise which grew so fantastically large over its forty years, built on a core which many, including the fans have forgotten.

The characterization and casting was supreme in all cases, funny when it was right, and serious when needed, and each original series cast member got worthy moments.<br/><br/>From this film's announcement, I approached the project with trepidation, having been disappointed by Abrams previous work, however, from the opening scene, he demonstrates that his story is not a lightweight walk around the park. Abrams masterfully plumbs the very depths of Star Trek lore to recover the core of what makes the franchise great. To a fan, it is nothing short of perfect, a shining homage to all that has come before, and a reason to hope for the future. To a non-fan, it stands alone as a refined, polished film, as interesting conceptually as it is thrilling visually.<br/><br/>The spirit of Star Trek has always given its viewers hope for the future. This film gives me hope for the future of Star Trek."

","Star Trek. When someone speaks this name, various images, ideas, characters and phrases come to mind. I know they certainly do with me. Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like ""Live long and Prosper"", ""Good God Jim, I'm a doctor not a."". I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.<br/><br/>To my great delight, I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening last night of JJ Abrams re-imaging of ""Star Trek"". I must admit that I was skeptical at first about taking such iconic characters and recasting them, even in younger iterations, because most people think of the characters of Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov with the actors that originally portrayed them. These portrayals are engrained in the pop culture consciousness of the world and hence my skepticism arose. Fortunately, my doubts were unnecessary.<br/><br/>This is not your father's ""Star Trek"". From the moment the movie begins, so does the action and it never lets up. However, this movie has more than just incredible and intense action, it also pays homage to the series of old. Sure, they wanted to bring us a Trek for the 21st century, but they also realized that they needed to respect the source material and fans of a series that has been around more than 40 years. However, you don't need to know much about Star Trek to enjoy this movie. Each character has been given a background and history that lets you know a little something about each one. There's a lot to be told in an origin movie and it is handled deftly by both the writers and the director.<br/><br/>But, what really made the movies for me were the actors chosen to play these roles, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, aka ""Bones"". This movie would not have worked if the casting of these three characters had not been spot on. Both Mr. Quinto and Urban uncannily channel their predecessors, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. They took on some of their inflections, mannerisms and expressions to really give you a sense that they are just younger versions of the originals. Chris Pine, however, takes on the most memorable role in Trek history and makes it his own. This Kirk is not only the womanizer, lover, and captain that you already know, but as portrayed by Mr. Pine also has a swagger, bravado, intelligence, and is a complete adrenaline junkie. We could not have asked for a better Kirk in this movie.<br/><br/>They have laid a solid foundation for a new series, with new life, perfect cast and a director with a true vision. If the first movie can be this good, my expectations for further adventures have risen exponentially.<br/><br/>This is my first review for our website and as such might not be very good since I have no experience at writing reviews. I intentionally didn't reveal any plot points so as to not spoil anything for whoever may read this. I may in the future reveal areas that may have spoilers but mark these sections so you can skip over them. I'll be seeing Wolverine tomorrow and hope to have a review up by tomorrow night. Until we meet again, ""Live long and Prosper!"""

","Yep, there are holes in the story. Putting that aside, this is great fun to watch. If they had done a bit better job of not being sloppy about those storyline holes, this movie would be a 10!<br/><br/>I'm a Trekkie from way back, but I have to disagree that the holes in this movie were any worse the many holes in the storylines of the original TV series. Give it a break, Trekkies, and enjoy this for what it is. We can't expect exact duplication of characters, either. These folks did a very decent job with their characters. If I have any complaint at all it is with Spock and Uhura having an affair. That was a bit of a stretch too far.<br/><br/>The second movie in the trilogy isn't bad, either, although the aliens at the beginning were a bit ridiculous. Overall, I'd give it a 7. But the third movie? Well, that really was a waste of time. The holes in that storyline made the holes in the first look like pin holes. So I guess I do have my limit on just how bad a storyline can be and still be forgiven. I'm afraid the 3rd movie has zero redeeming qualities. I give it a 2 only because Pine still manages to do some great acting given a terrible script."

","Fantastic remake of the original version of Star Trek, But the only glitch is at the beginning of the movie. The Star Trek Crew are at a bar, and then four Members of the Ships Crew, get into a fist fight with a Civilian, and not one of the Crewmen face any Military charges against this unlawful behavior, but James Kirk is placed on trial for cheating on a exam. What gives? This sends a really mixed up message to the viewers. Being a Former Marine and in Law Enforcement both in the Military and Civilan, misdemeanors and assault with intent to cause harm should have been applied. Instead no jail time, the Crew go beat up Civilians while on temporary leave and just go back to the U.S.S.Enterprise and go back to their duties on the ship. I don't think so. They Crew would have been detained by the local authorities of Law Enforcement and placed in jail until released from their custody and then go back to court for a trial. Even in the future the Law still stands firm. The new Enterprise Crew does a great job, given the shoes the Actors have to fill: Other than that, I really liked the movie, top notch."

"Boba_Fett1138","9","2","7","1 August 2010"," A perfect fresh start.
","After seeing this movie I'm quite excited about seeing a whole lot more new fresh 'Star Trek' movies, even though I never have been a fan about anything Star Trek related prior to this movie. Sure, some of the movies were great and some of the television series also had some likable characters and great episodes in them but I was just never grabbed by the entire universe of worlds, species, the science aspects and other things and canon surrounding the franchise. Eeryhing was always so clean, smooth and sophisticated. And how different this movie turned out to be!<br/><br/>With this movie they gave the franchise a brand new look and made it more ready and appropriate for the 21th century and its modern audience. They really went back to the source with this, meaning that all of the character from the very first Star Trek series, originating back from 1966, get reintroduced and set up again. It's a reboot and I can say it's one of the best and most effective ones out of recent years, when lets of stuff seems to get a reboot.<br/><br/>It's simply an awesome movie to watch. You might remember all of the characters as a bit dorky and even wimpy ones but all get a fresh and better treatment in this movie now. Every character is an awesome one and gets to show his and hers special skills, that make them the perfect crew members of the USS Enterprise. It's still an 'origins' story, that shows all of the characters in their late teens, early twenties, on their first big adventure together. So it still mostly serves as a movie that sets up its characters, which only means that we can expect even greater things from future coming movies, that don't have to spend any more time on doing this.<br/><br/>Besides, it's a movie with plenty of action in it, which helps to make this movie such an awesome one. And the action is just simply great. Space battles never really were an awesome things to watch in any Star Trek movie or series but this one has some great, intense battles in it, that above all things are also wonderful looking ones. Its special effects are nothing short of great and make this movie a beautiful and spectacular one. J.J. Abrams really again nailed it with this one! The smooth, perfect look of the previous series and movies is pretty much gone in this movie and things look more gritty, realistic and spectacular.<br/><br/>Another really surprising thing about this movie is its acting. Not all cast members are well known established names but everybody absolutely did an outstanding job with their characters. I really hope they can keep the cast together for lots of more future Star Trek movies to come, with J.J. Abrams at the helm again.<br/><br/>Granted that the story is not really that great or special enough. Even the villain, no matter how awesome he is, just isn't that much of an interesting one. Nevertheless you sort of simply look over this all while watching this movie and see it as a great, spectacular and entertaining one.<br/><br/>It's a fresh modern update but still one with lots of respect for the original series, characters and also its fans. They did a great job at still capturing the look of the original series but still by making it look more slick and cooler for todays new young audience as well. It's why this movie works out so well for both the die hard fans of the older Star Trek series and movies and todays audience, who never grew up with watching any earlier Star Trek stuff.<br/><br/>The franchise has been dusted off and really been beamed up to the 21th century by J.J. Abrams. Bring on the next films!<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","What J.J.Abrams realized is far beyond the ordinary. It's not a movie for everyone: if you don't like the purest action and you're a fan of melodramatic series, don't see it. It will change your life style. <br/><br/>Abrams gave us the opportunity to see the universe of Star Trek with other eyes. It's a piece of art, a little dramatic at the beginning. The actors are very good in what they're doing: the perfectly combination between sound, screenplay and special effects are more than incredible. The only thing i don't like is the fact that they change the original score, the music of old Star Trek. <br/><br/>Sometimes hilarious, almost as good as Star Wars - it's well know that the director it's a big fan of Star Wars universe - always keeps you awake, it's a must see movie.

"YouHadMeAtDolphins","5","2","7","6 January 2010"," It's still just a TV show.
","This one was nothing more than just an extend version of the TV series in a way: the action is about the same; the story seems conveniently crafted to get the crew out of difficult situations with some silly/cute escapes; and everything is always OK at the end, with a bright look at the future. What I mean by this is that the violence wasn't really violent. The phazer shots surely do hit the bad guys and they all go flying and dying, but they're not intense, violent, nasty shots with blood and guts pouring out and heads flying. The torture scene even skirted away from actually showing Captain Pike getting the creature biting down into his brain stem. The bad guys didn't really seem like such bad guys, they all point fingers, speak loudly and bang their chests like gorillas but it all seems kind of hollow. Even the quick scene of the ice monster biting down on the other ice-cow on Delta-Vega didn't seem scary, it was more comical, ending up in another convenient escape for Kirk. All of the characters are supposed to be re-introduced and re-imagined, and besides Kirk and Scotty, all of them seem to be just a bunch of caricatures. Zach Quinto seems to be trying to figure out whether he needs to be more like the Nimoy Spock or his own version and never really is fully able to be just this particular Spock the entire movie. Chekov seems forced in this version by Anton Yelchin . All of Sulu's life seem to be drained out of him in this version as John Cho does nothing to bring the warmth and humor that we knew of George Takei (and perhaps that's because John Cho is Korean-American and Takei was Japanese-American - just because they're Asian, doesn't mean they're the same). And Uhura is all kissy-kissy sexy but she looks like she is almost put aside on deck and just tries so hard to get everybody's attention. As for the bad guys, Eric Bana is a complete waste in the movie, it didn't need to be him as he is so limited in this film. A major plot point was forgotten about and skipped: when Nero inserted the bug into Pike, I was waiting for the code that Nero was asking for to be spat out by Pike, so I fully expected the Romulan to head to the Federation to destroy it from the inside with the code obtained. So why go through that hassle of obtaining the code and tell us the story if you're not going to follow that tale? I gave it a pedestrian mid-grade for this movie, because just for once, I would like to see an intense, R-rated, truly scary, truly violent-action version of Star Trek instead of this child's play. I'm glad I only saw it as a rental at home on Blu-Ray, as I would not want to pay the money to go see a movie that's about as good as what you might see on TV normally. I'm glad I didn't pay the $10. People are blind to think this was a great movie for the big screen, it really isn't. It's just a slightly more embellished TV-movie. The SFX and designs are about what you would expect these days, so unless they do something spectacular, it's just an overblown TV-movie. Even the final sequence of the Romulan ship being sucked into the black-hole was tame and not very exciting, bunch of Romulans running around and bits of barely discernible broken ship parts edited together with swish-pans to make it seem exciting, but instead it just looked like Abrams ran out of ideas on how to make it look desperate and threatening and original and just sort of created a swish-edit sequence of bits and pieces as you might see on a TV show any given night on the networks. Just like Abrams' last effort MI:III, he really is a TV director, not a feature film director, where the intensity is always just a bit tame and not so serious and is always conveniently explained away or not explained at all and the story just sort of moves along to the next thing with a convenient edit. He still hasn't learned how to handle scene transitions: you can always tell where the commercial would come in between scenes with Abrams. I could literally pause the film at those moments and go to the bathroom and come back and I wouldn't feel like I left the movie in any way whatsoever. I hope Abrams sticks to doing TV and let a real feature film director take the helm when he produces."
"galensaysyes","7","2","7","1 January 2010"," Good for what it is, but missing a lot
","""Star Trek"" is good for what it is, which is boys' space opera, and on that single level it satisfies the senses. J. J. Abrams is a director with the common touch, the ability to reach a mass audience without appearing to patronize it. All the same, the movie is missing a lot of things that even boys' adventure stories should have.<br/><br/>Most obviously, it lacks a subject. The Star Trek series was always about something; this movie isn't about anything. It has no moral, no message, no point to make about human experience; and although its plot would seem to require that it show the maturation of the two main characters, Kirk and Spock, it doesn't: they remain the same at the end as at the beginning, like comic book characters. As a result, although the movie runs two and quarter hours, one leaves it with a sense of having seen less, about enough for one episode of a Saturday morning cartoon.<br/><br/>Also, the movie has no beauty, even of the mechanized kind. A lot of techno movies, and even anime, offer alluring pictures along the way; here all the mecha and the architecture, while not particularly true to life, are more like engineering designs. The film-making is similarly workmanlike: it keeps the action going, but without grace or lyricism; it does the job, and that's all.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie dumbs down and vulgarizes the series unnecessarily. And although Spock is pictured exactly as on the series, Kirk has been turned into a hard-drinking, hard-loving hell-raiser, who never turns into the Kirk we know and love (or tolerate). Yet, oddly for such a character, he seems to have only three acquaintances, and even the progress of his relationships with them isn't dramatized. We get only a handful of illustrative moments, one-offs, like comic book panels. The same is true of his training at the academy, and indeed of most of the other elements in the movie.<br/><br/>The script is credited to the executive producers; Abrams can write better than this; I wonder why he didn't redo it himself."
"arthera09","9","2","7","31 December 2009"," impressed
","I will preface this review with the fat that I hate Star Trek and the universe it has created. This has to do with my upbringing and my love of the cerebral type of science fiction and not the pop corn fare that Star Trek seems to normally encompass. This movie was a one word ""fun"". There were great action set pieces and was sharply written. The movie never meandered and kept my attention for the entire movie and help up to criticism during the viewing. I will usually watch a movie trying to keep my eyes open for things to criticize, and things to praise, but his movie I was just caught up too much in the whole experience that I missed a lot of that. The cast I guess made this movie. With a lesser cast this would have just been some good story telling, but the cast made set this movie more than just popcorn fun. I loved Simon Pegg and wish he could have gotten more screen time. I guess the one downfall that this movie had is the same downfall most action movies have with me and that is the use of crappy editing and shaky cameras during close quarters action scenes. Be it the hand to hand combat on the drill or the phaser shoot out on the mining ship directors need to learn to make these scenes work. This is just a personal gripe that I have, but I also suck so no one should put that much thought into this criticism. Good times."
"Niffiwan","7","2","7","4 June 2009"," A film of its era
","This new Star Trek film uses a fast pace and dense cinematography to keep the viewer from realizing that there are several plot-holes that crop up throughout the story. The creators clearly hoped that by keeping things moving fast enough and constantly engaging the viewer's emotions, the viewer would not have the luxury of figuring out that the actual story doesn't work. In this, it is a product of the dominant film-making school of this era. Suitably, that is also one of the main themes driving the film: Emotion is good, as Spock's father tells Spock at the end. Unless the emotion belongs to someone who destroys planets out of revenge, of course. So the film is not very interesting, unfortunately, on the intellectual front, in contrast to the series.<br/><br/>But it does succeed on a number of other levels. The actors generally did a good job - I have few complaints there. I think that Chekov's Russian accent might have been a bit overdone.<br/><br/>Here are the flaws in the story that I noticed:<br/><br/>1) Two ships and a supernova get sucked into a black hole. One ship comes out in the past, the other comes out 25 years later. Where the enormous supernova goes is left unanswered. Somehow a black hole distinguishes the matter of the two ships from the matter of the supernova? One ship decides to wait 25 years for the other ship to come out; how its crew knows WHEN the other ship will come out or if it will come out at all is left unanswered. <br/><br/>2) The planet-drilling needles can be destroyed just by firing a few laser beams from a small ship, yet none of the planets under attack do anything about them except panic.<br/><br/>3) Kirk becomes captain after provoking Spock to an extreme emotional response, which disqualifies Spock from being captain. However, in the ensuing fight, and in his conduct before that, Kirk is shown to be far more emotional and violent. Yet he takes over the captain's chair, and nobody objects. After what had just happened, the whole crew and Spock had a very good reason to dislike him, yet they all become pals a short time later. <br/><br/>4) The monster chase on the ice planet strains all credibility. Just everything about it.<br/><br/>On the whole, it was an okay experience. It's not a badly-made film at all, but it aims at mainstream sensibilities. I always thought that the low budget of the Star Trek TV series forced it to be interesting from a story point of view. With a high-budget blockbuster movie, there is a shift of priorities towards eye candy and action. There is enough of the core spirit left for it to be called ""Star Trek"", but I'd rather watch the TV episodes."
"misterwrite-1","9","2","7","19 May 2009"," Star Trek Is Finally Cool!
","I've been a long fan of the original series. I grew up on the re-runs and had the toys and the books and the action figures. (I still do!) I even saw Gene Roddenberry when he came touring around before the 1st movie.<br/><br/>J.J. and his writers nailed this movie! It is true to the spirit of the original series yet completely new. It was somehow like having my old friends back but not. A very strange feeling. But how wonderful! I no longer have to watch STII: The Wrath of Khan or STIV: The Voyage Home over and over again.<br/><br/>The new Trek is fun, action-packed, with cool explosions, and gorgeous women. (The new Uhura lights up the screen. I couldn't take my eyes off her.)<br/><br/>Shrewdly, the creative team has the Kirk/Spock relationship at the emotional center of the redux. They have done their homework well. Nice job guys. Congratulations. And a big thanks. Star Trek is finally cool."
"Figaro 1","9","2","7","18 May 2009"," Combines reverence with freshness
","Like many people who will see and comment on this film, I grew up on Star Trek without becoming a Trekkie. The characters are old friends and form a trope of childhood and adolescence. If you enjoyed Star Trek TOS in this way, you don't need to be a convention-going Trekkie to want to see these characters and Roddenberry's legacy treated with respect. The movie accomplishes this task while also bringing freshness and new creative energy to the Trek space saga.<br/><br/>In fact, the new film is so character driven that we don't really care if Pine is not Shatner or Quinto not Nimoy. It doesn't matter because the script and direction imbue the new actors' interpretations with glimpses and glimmers of the old actors' creations: Pine's chomping on an apple while cheating on the Kobayashi Maru test, which references Shatner's scene in Wrath of Khan in which he reminisces on the same event; the new McCoy's slight, undefinable Southern accent as well as the more obvious references to the character's notorious irritability; Scotty's easy smile and child-like joy in the ship's abilities; even the last view of Christopher Pike in a wheelchair at the end of the film foreshadows that captain's fate in the original series. Quinto's Spock is perhaps the exception here, seeming to live outside Nimoy's creation because of a (largely implausible) backstory with Uhura but nevertheless linked to the older Spock through Nimoy's cameo. What makes these references work is that they are subtle; they are not elbow jabs in the ribs of Trekkies so they can chuckle knowingly at the insider references. They are simply there for those who can notice them, and even for veterans of the original series they may be too fleeting to be noticed immediately.<br/><br/>The other part is the freshness: the re-imagined Enterprise--also a trope from childhood but now with a makeover that rekindles the sense of wonder people must have felt when seeing the original series the first time. Then the utterly new: Nero's ship, surely one of the most sinister in a long line of enemy vessels designed to convey menace through architecture. It succeeds brilliantly--all sharp, jagged surfaces and uneven planes, a nightmarish mixture of M.C. Escher and Dario Argento.<br/><br/>There's no need to go too far into special effects or even the story. The former are overwhelmingly good, though that's simply to be expected these days. The latter is somewhat obtuse and I'm still not sure I quite get it. But the reason these things are secondary is the same reason Star Trek has always been and continues to be successful. It brings strong, well-defined characters together and lets us see how they interact in a future world brought to life with the detail and fantasy of Roddenberry's amazing imagination. Long live Star Trek."
"pontram","7","2","7","15 May 2009"," Star Trek Goes Kajal and Cloverfield
","I never saw in a movie from the period of color and sound that much Kajal on the actors eyes, except in Fellini's Satyricon. When I noticed first that Kirk's lid-margins are heavily painted with black Kajal, I took a closer look on the others - and I was astonished that there must have been used some kilograms, like in an old silent movie, because almost all lids are painted. So far, so strange.<br/><br/>That concludes the biggest impression the movie made on me, except disappointment. I always hope for good new SF movies, and although I am a Trek fan I am open for new and unusual approaches. I enjoyed ST:ENT more than TOS, and i compassionate its termination much more than any other's from the trek universe. The same with Farscape and Firefly for the non-Trek lines.<br/><br/>I hoped that this new movie will break the line of the soapy and faithfully TNG. And so it does, but in a very unpleasant manner. Awaiting a new and astonishing voyage with new ideas and visions, instead, I got old and stale time hopping stories with logical errors and plot holes as big as gas giants. After Nero's appearance the movie died for me. And Nero appears very early. After it is revealed that he's a miner, his invincible ship is obviously around a driller, and he waited 25 years (without doing anything than masterbating together with his comrades, I assume) for the unsure appearance of tottery old Spock (who could also come 250 or 250000 years later) through a singularity that was deployed without any need, because the supernova it should prevent already destroyed Nero's planet, I had to switch off my brain immediately to prevent suffering permanent damage (until there I let it run in a kind of power-saving state), after Kirk met Spock by accident on an icy world, which is within sight of Vulcan, but unaffected by it's cataclysmic Nero-initiated disappearance. Fortunately, because we learned then that there is something called trans-warp-beaming, which would eradicate any need for any further action except trans-warping a big grenade into Nero's vessel and make it boom (to hell with ol' Pike), and so on and on...<br/><br/>I personally hate the shaky cam, I feel no increasing realism. Shaky cam is for private holiday movies, in reality my view of the world is compensated by my brain and steady even when the bus driver goes bananas. Why did the Trek world blame Shatner for his use of hand cameras in ST5, and why do they praise Abrams for the same now ?<br/><br/>Furthermore, I had the impression that the production team had no love for their product. They made a brainless action trip around a bunch of youngsters, because youngsters on the big screen will draw youngsters<br/><br/>With cash-flow into the theaters, whatever rubbish is running there. Starting from there, they had no need to put some pieces of storytelling or sense for atmosphere into their bland soup. Yes, action here, action there, action everywhere, and some jokes for the IQ-60 audience. The Ninja Transformer Turtles are wearing Star Fleet uniforms, brouhaha.<br/><br/>The best in this movie is Spock's father. His figure is a real improvement as it is the first time he is allowed to show that he has a relation to his son. The actor is perfectly chosen for his part.<br/><br/>Kirk himself is also not bad in some scenes, but his quality as a 3d-chess player who can beat even Spock, I mean his gaming intelligence, is not shown in the least. He is simple a ruffian, and so is Spock. I highly fear a Sequel where they both continue spanking god-mighty Ferenghi from the future or inseminate dangerous Tribble females in this sappy alternate universe.<br/><br/>I would have given more stars if there would have been at least a scene where Spock's artificial teeth set is shown in a glass together with the mysterious red matter floating around, as Nero's ultimate revenge to teach Spock why he really failed.<br/><br/>Every other star above 4 I added regretfully through the years because of overlooking most absurdities mentioned above and thinking ""c'mon, don't be so hard, be thankful instead, it's a Trek-Movie at least""."

"laserdude","9","2","7","11 May 2009"," The Star Trek Roller-coaster Ride
","There is so much to like about this movie. And so many questions about future adventures. I'm one of those rare persons who liked all incarnations of Star Trek...but for various reasons. The original T.V. series had it's sense of complete newness. And a kind of urban legend as reports came in years later of people who had received some kind of physical healing or emotional realization after watching reruns of TOS. Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine each had greatness in various episodes that sometimes surpassed the original idea of creating the episode to begin with. Even Enterprise had moments of pure genius in it.<br/><br/>For me the movies were always like a class reunion. And even in some of the films that brought heavy negative comments, there were elements that came close to exploring aspects of space travel and the miracles of the human soul that were quite stirring if the budget or the writing could have been allowed a deeper look into the story lines presented.<br/><br/>I like the new Star Trek very much. It's fun. Visually stunning in parts. The ""space jump"" for example (though perhaps violated the laws of physics) was something that drew me in as though I was falling through the cosmos along with the three trek-o-nauts to their heroic deed. Another favorite was the jump to warp-speed. Finally I got the feeling of what it might be like to travel faster than light.<br/><br/>And the actors playing their parts were actually pretty good. But for all the wondrousness's of this film - the general sense was that of a roller-coaster ride (one you want to go on again for the thrill - which I'm sure was the film-makers'intent). And that is okay. It was interesting to see new faces play familiar characters.<br/><br/>But I think the real test of this ""reboot"" will be to see where it will go from here. The basics have been layed down for a truly out of this world experience with a storyline to match. The potential is there, that is for sure. My only complaint was that at times the camera could have stayed still for awhile to allow the viewer to take in the amazing visual quality of this movie.<br/><br/>My other question would be related to model building - which I do on occasion. I wonder how detailed the model kit that gets released for public purchase will be? (of course that's just the geek in me talking). Many will enjoy this movie for the sheer fun of it. And the visuals will probably make you a little dizzy. But so do rollercoasters."
"rudy-altergott","9","2","7","11 May 2009"," The New Final Frontier
","As a moderate Star Trek fan, I came into the film with an open mind, hyped by the extravagant trailers and ad campaigns Paramount ran pre-release. I enjoy the Star Trek franchise because of its premise: the adventures of members of a quasi-military peacekeeping ""armada"", as Christopher Pike puts it, fending off formidable foes both human and alien. The idea of yet another franchise reboot turned me off at first, but after considering Batman Begins and The Dark Knight as well as James Bond and other sagas, I knew this one would be worth it. J.J. Abrams has done it again, as well as Roberto Orci, and Alex Kurtzman, who I personally think are two of the greatest screenwriters of our time. Once again they have created a plot so complex yet so understandable that it is beyond worthy of being used in a Star Trek project. And for once, it ain't the Klingons that are the prime opponents. We barely see them this time around. Instead it's those ruthless Romulans (who were more pawns in the last Trek films than the main foes). <br/><br/>Now for a history lesson.<br/><br/>Enter 2387: A star/sun in the dominion of the Romulan Star Empire (which we learn in the comic prequels is called Hobus) is on the verge of supernova, threatening the capital planet Romulus as well. Ambassador Spock, still working with the Romulans at least since the Vulcan-Romulan reunification movement 20 years prior, volunteers to solve the problem with the help of the Vulcan Science Academy by trying to use ""red matter"" to compress the star into a black hole via an experimental ship. Before he can do so, Romulus is destroyed and Spock and the Romulan mining ship Narada are sucked into opposite ends of the black hole.<br/><br/>2233: The Narada, commanded by the vengeful Captain Nero, comes upon the Federation starship Kelvin, overpowering it with its advanced weaponry and forcing its Captain Robau to come aboard to discuss terms, killing him when they figure out they're too far in the past to kill Spock for his failure. Meanwhile, first-officer George S. Kirk takes control of the Kelvin, evacuates all crew and passengers (including is wife, in labor with his newborn son), and sets a collision course for the Narada when autopilot fails. Before dying in the collision, he names his son James Tiberius and says goodbye to his wife. The shuttles make it to the safety with an important passenger onboard with his mother. <br/><br/>2240s: Kirk and Spock are briefly shown with their own conflicts as they grow up.<br/><br/>2255: Spock rejects the Vulcan Science Academy and the emotion-shedding Way of Kolinahr, deciding in stead to become an officer and instructor at Starfleet. Kirk gets into a scuffle over Nyota Uhura in Iowa, after which he meets Christopher Pike, who persuades him to enlist in Starfleet and Dr. Leonard McCoy, who becomes his fast friend.<br/><br/>2258: Spock Prime exits the black hole seconds after entering it 129 years in the future, and is captured by Nero, who strands him on the near-Vulcan wasteland of Delta Vega while the fanatic prepares to destroy Vulcan as payback. Meanwhile, Kirk cheats his third try at the Kobayashi Maru, earning the ire of its designer: Commander Spock. During court martial, while Kirk argues with Spock, a distress signal is sent from pacifist Vulcan that has command send all of Starfleet, cadets included, to help. Kirk, on academic suspension, is grounded from the relief mission until McCoy gives him hilarious illnesses to get him onboard with him to the new Starfleet flagship Enterprise while Uhura uses Spock's ""favoritism"" to get her on NCC-1701 as well. Captain Pike and crew, including Sulu and Chekov, make way for Vulcan after Sulu turns off the external inertial dampeners. The journey begins. <br/><br/>Will they reach Vulcan in time? Will they save Nero's next inevitable target: Earth? Will we see Ambassador Spock Prime? Where the bloody hell is Montgomery Scott?! See the movie and find out.<br/><br/>The plot easily and fluidly transitions in a pleasant way that keeps you enthralled but not overwhelmed. And Orci and Kurtzman, genius that they are, use the Narada and Spock Prime's time travel to create an alternate reality (surpassing predestination paradox) where anything can happen rather than the Trek history we know. Basically, it's a clean slate. And Michael Giacchino's soundtrack is unique yet eerily similar to Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner yet not. It's indescribable. His music sells the film, with its Goldenthal Batman flare, Chinese-like Spock theme, and comedic tones. The recurring theme that comes up almost as often Morricone's Gabriel's Oboe in The Mission is a masterpiece that some may say is overused but I say keeps continuity.<br/><br/>The quality of picture and cinematography in this film is breathtaking. I plan to see it in its limited IMAX format, which to me is the only way to see movies with the current HD formats of films. And with the realistic and epic scale Abrams has used in this project, you are guaranteed to be blown away, regular theater and/or IMAX. If you are looking for a good time, and enjoy the Star Trek pantheon, I recommend this film. Even if you're not into sci-fi, I've been telling everyone since before I saw this flick, its just as much action now as it is science, which keeps fans like myself and fundamentalist Trekkies reeled in. You will leave the theater motivated to join Starfleet and fight the enemies of the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, the Borg, Cardassians, etc. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. <br/><br/>In the words of Spock, ""Live long and prosper."""

Namely , the attention that the wizards from ILM have given to the most minute details is beyond belief ( i. e. - The Enterprise entering the battle zone smack into the countless floating debris of other ships , the concept design of its interiors - slick , but still ' ungainly ' , as based on the existing technological solutions - pipes , tubes , valves and counters, the lack of room , the bustle and hustle , too bad you can't produce the smells !- simply , the transportation of present into the not too distant future is visible in every shot ,the smart restaurant menus with familiar logos on them ,etc.etc.) .Even the choice of mostly unknown actors , at least to me , is superb , as every one of them shows a great talent , love for the past series , and brains ! On the negative side : the storyline gets a little bit confusing with the warping of time and singularity effects , but , hey , surprisingly , it won't kill your love for the film.And for the end : pay special attention to one of the wackiest scenes in history : the ' space diving ', incredible idea,and its execution!"

","I enjoyed this movie and even though my 17yo daughter won't watch any of the old shows, she enjoyed the heck out of this one. She cried when Kirk's Dad died, and can't wait for the sequel. <br/><br/>Great sets and effects, actors nail their characters, and a new path opens for future shows!<br/><br/>Anyways, there appears to me to be a little bit of a structural problem:<br/><br/>The Enterprise warps away from Vulcan as it explodes, and some time passes before Young Spock boots Young Kirk off in an escape pod, to land shortly thereafter on an M Class planet Delta Vega, where he meets the stranded Old Spock.<br/><br/>Old Spock does a mind meld with Young Kirk, and shows him the destruction of Vulcan as he'd seen it, from Delta Vega, the planet they were on, from a vantage point close enough that Vulcan's surface features were as clearly visible as those of Earth's moon viewed from Earth. <br/><br/>Problem: Distances don't match. Kirk would have traveled a great distance, at warp speed, from Vulcan after it exploded, before leaving the Enterprise to land shortly there after on Delta Vega, the planet that Old Spock had viewed Vulcan's destruction from close-up. Which is it, close up or far away? Kirk couldn't have traveled so far, to wind up so close to his starting point."
"NotSureifthisis7734","8","2","7","10 May 2009"," A near perfect cast saves the day.
","When I first saw stills from this movie, I grudgingly admitted that the physical resemblance of the new cast to the original was strong, for the most part, but there is so much more that would be required to make this work. I honestly feared the worst from what I came to think of as ""Tiger Beat Trek."" So I can happily say that I was pleased, relieved one might way, when I saw the final product. Again, the cast for the most part nails it and goes beyond nailing it. In some cases, such as Karl Urban's take on Sylvester McCoy, the impersonation, the channeling if you will, is astonishing. Let's be clear on this. Urban steals every scene he is in. He doesn't have to but he could have carried the entire movie. He deserves some kind of award for his work here. I would have been happy enough to have watched ""Bones McCoy: Space Doctor, part I"" as I was to see ""Star Trek: The Reboot."" <br/><br/>The guys who do Kirk and Spock and Scotty are very good too. <br/><br/>So while the script I found to be confused and noisy in many places, is serviceable enough and gets the job done it was not worthy of the opportunity that had been given. The effects and sets are perfect, but with a little more work, a good film could have been a great one. With a cast this good, surely someone must have thought at some point: these guys are fantastic. Let's dump this pseudo-science, black hole, time travel stuff and really give them something to work with. And maybe in the second movie, they will. I have confidence there will be a second movie.<br/><br/>It was disappointing to have them riff on the the old series (which was as much fun to watch as it must have been to do) and fail to go beyond it. The original series was a mixed bag, to be sure, but it worked astonishingly well when they had good writers (and they certainly did the first season and for some of the second -- not so much the third, however). Good writing can triumph over anything, which is why fans of the original series can go back again and again to episodes like ""City on the Edge of Forever,"" and ""Amok Time."" However, the greatest effects and production values in the world would never be able to salvage ""Spock's Brain."" When you have one of the best ensemble casts going, get a script that is worthy of them.<br/><br/>And I don't mean all that boring philosophical stuff. The original series wasn't really about anything so much as it was about this wonderful cast that Roddenberry with his great gifts as a producer had assembled, and would never be able to equal again. Star Trek is family, as another Gene, Siskel, noted. Perhaps, like a family real reunion, it is great when it happens that every one is looking and feeling good and holds promise for years of good times to come. <br/><br/>Keep the promise. All that I ask is that next time boldly go where few writers have gone before, to real feeling and depth and story, letting the work of Harlan Ellison be our guide, instead of roping in one more set of writers who don't quite know what to do when an incredible opportunity is handed them."
"kingweir-1","8","2","7","10 May 2009"," Next Generation?
","I've just got back from the cinema & too be honest, I'm not sure, i cant make my mind up. When they 1st said they where making a new Star Trek based on the original series, i was like, No, don't ruined it! But after seeing trailers, started to get my hopes up...<br/><br/>But then, the opening sequence & straight away, i realised this wasn't a Star Trek i was used too. It was the usual view of seeing the crew from the view-screen of seeing the view-screen from just behind the Captain's chair. The camera was always at slight angles & even though it was all clean & white sets, there was this feeling that it was abit more cramped for quizsmo & screens here there & everywhere. Supports struts etc cutting across at odd angles. And no more big huge shuttle bay for a couple of shuttles, it looked more like a hanger. Too be honest, i was abit shocked. It was clear this was a nitty gritty take on Star Trek. Action packed through out to be honest & it was really good!<br/><br/>But being a life long Trekkie, even though the i wasn't even born when the original series came out, i grew up watching the films & the re-runs on telly etc & sadly just like in Enterprise series, history has been altered. Though i did enjoy Enterprise, i had to think of it, as separate & you have to do the same with this new film as well & sadly they use the same excuse as they did in Enterprise! And I'm left thinking, yes it was really good but surely they could of done this film, just as good & yet kept in in line with current history, as a Trekkie & original series fan, i would of like to see the way, Kirk really got command!<br/><br/>But never mind, we stick with it & it was a really good film, fantastic effects, a lot of action, apart from a couple of minor things, a pretty good script.<br/><br/>Those things being, aleast for me, starting with the least annoying to the most annoying!<br/><br/>5. In Enterprise, the Sulban, a race of species never seen before turns up & in this film, it look more like Star Wars, with weird aliens popping up all over the place, the only way i can get over the fact, is in VI, in the Klingon prison was quite a few aliens, we've never seen before. 4. Scotty is funny, which on its own isn't bad, but he's funny than McCoy & it seems like he's not a genius but more of an accidental genius. 3. Bones, they tried too hard with him, to many clichés, throwing too man old jokes in. 2. Spock leaving Kirk on a planet. When really, in that situation would of put him in the brig. Only reason this happens, is, just so he can meet the older Spock, its so obvious. 1. Spock & Uhura getting intimate! Never mind in front of 5 other crew members! I'm just hoping in a later film, he realises, he's being embarrassing to his race & goes cold turkey to fit in with his frigid attitude in the original series. And the ultimate reason this film is annoying, is they use the excuse, is that this isn't the way history was meant to play out, this is the destiny they where meant to have, this is an alternate universe!<br/><br/>Isn't that why the Enterprise series failed to ignite the Trekkie fan base? Even though as Trekkies, we still watched it anyway?!<br/><br/>So as a stand alone film, its amazing! As a Trekkie, i think i would of made sum slight changes to the script.<br/><br/>Overall, i get the feeling, this film isn't aimed at the current Trekkie audiences but as been made, to lure in the next generation of Trekkie fans & thanks to there excuse, the old fans cant complain too much with out being told but its an 'alternate universe' though!<br/><br/>Whatever you do guys, don't turn it into a TV series, it'll just flop & u'll not get anyway near as visually stunning either. Not that, i think they will, i don't think a trilogy would do it justice though, so maybe another 3 to 5 films explaining this latest alternate universe of the Star Trek universe.........<br/><br/>.... oh & please, in Enterprise, i thought they should of really made the Romulan war (instead of the Expanse war), this would be a good time to make the Romulan war, you've already given command to Kirk sooner than he original got it, so it could of been soon enough for him & the Enterprise to be involved in the fighting. Though i think an Enterprise failed based on the Romulan war would fit better.... but as a Trekkie, the Romulan war, is something that has always been hinted at, that there had been one but we've never seen, sadly."
"WizardOfGore","9","2","7","10 May 2009"," Let the Nitpicking Begin!!!
","This entire review/commentary might contain spoilers.<br/><br/>First of all, I am a die-hard Trekkie. I have seen all the movies many times (even the ones that suck), and I even watched 'Enterprise' out of some misguided sense of obligation. Having said all that, I LOVED this movie. I have NO problem that they went with an alternate time line theory. In fact, I think it was a very clever way to both honor what had come before, and to start something new.<br/><br/>To all the people who are saying ""Oh my God! What have they done? How dare they tinker with our beloved Star Trek time line and canon!"" I have this to say. While you are certainly entitled to your opinion, if your emotional well-being is tied to a TV/movie franchise, then it's time to rearrange your priorities.<br/><br/>Why is it so impossible for some people to simultaneously love what came before, and embrace something new? It's just unbelievable how some people just want to conjure up the same tired old retreads that bogged down the movies and the TV shows after a while. What were they supposed to do, somehow resurrect Khan for another go around? Throw Sisko and Janeway on the same ship, just to see what happens? I thought this movie had the perfect respect for all of the elements that made us love Trek in the first place, while refreshing it for a new generation.<br/><br/>One last thing, let's not forget that when Star Trek premiered 40+ years ago, the ratings sucked, no one liked it, and it lasted only three seasons. If it were not for a die hard fan base to keep it going, it would have ended in 1969 and that would have been it."

","OK, I was entertained. This film had good visuals, entertaining and well-introduced characters, lots of homages to earlier Star Trek stuff.<br/><br/>OTOH, the main storyline was pretty weak and derivative. I was reminded of the Star Trek: Voyager two-part episode ""Year of Hell"", but that episode was far superior, especially in the portrayal of the villain.<br/><br/>The most annoying part is that the film presses the reset button for the whole Star Trek universe (at least starting with TOS). While ""Enterprise"" worked pretty well at staying consistent with the later developments, this film just resets the whole thing without need.<br/><br/>Some details (spoilers): This is the second film in a row to have a ship ogg another (has this ever happened before ST X?).

"Jonny_Numb","8","3","13","25 May 2009"," Even for the novice, ""Star Trek"" is worth beaming up
","I walked into ""Star Trek"" a near-complete novice: years ago, I tried watching its various television incarnations, only to be met with an indifference that didn't encourage subsequent viewing; similarly, I am also oblivious to the television/film work of director J.J. Abrams. So to say I entered the theater with nary an idea of what to expect would be an understatement. But I'm glad I did. With a keen eye for eye-catching special-effects, coherently-edited action, and fully developed characters (with a surprising amount of gleefully tongue-in-cheek moments), ""Star Trek"" not only sets the bar for this summer's explosion-laden, big-budget blockbusters, but could very well be one of the best films of 2009, period. The notion of tearing down the well-established mythologies of iconic characters and franchises in favor of a fresh start (Christopher Nolan's Batman films come immediately to mind) is a sometimes-risky venture, depending on who's at the helm; luckily, Abrams and co-writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman find a happy medium that will appease fans and newcomers alike. The villain this time out is a Romulan ruler named Nero (Eric Bana), seeking vengeance against Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto), who he alleges responsibility for the destruction of his home planet; in the meantime, Abrams gives welcome attention to his characters' backstories, from James Kirk's (Chris Pine--""Smokin' Aces"") posturing as a James Dean-esquire rebel, and Spock's persecution for being half-human and -Vulcan. While the story is intricate enough to avoid lazy summer predictability, what really elevates ""Star Trek"" (in addition to its mind-blowing effects) is the personalities and emotional dilemmas of its characters."

"s-vandelaar","10","3","13","7 May 2009"," How cool was that?!
","Anticipating a big disappointment I headed to the cinema on the premier day. The cinema scheduled Star Trek in the smallest room available. Hmmm... Was this a prelude of things to come? However, it was filled to the rim. And it should be. What a surprise! Leaning heavily on stunning visual effects, the opening scene offered more drama than I expected and the joyride it promised continued all of the 126 minutes. Not a minute of boredom, just a beautiful story with a superb cast. Critics have mentioned that it is nothing more than a cheap way to 'kill' TOS. But no! A brilliant way to attract both Trekkies and a new audience. Let's be honest. TNG was brilliant, DS9 a big disappointment, Voyager was OK and enterprise is not all that it could have been. So a jump start? Most definitely! The new flick offers more than enough for insiders and at the same time does not drive the newbies out of the cinema. The storyline is complete and the appearance of Leonard Nimoy gives the storyline a classic Star Trek twist. Off course, you know what the outcome will be, but it is done in such a magnificent way that at least I was in awe of this movie. Some may not agree, even strongly disagree, but hey. That's OK. Go and see it for yourself. I sincerely hope you will have a night like mine. I am writing this right now satisfied and happy because I know this new cast stands at the dawn of going boldly where no man has gone before..."
"MartinHafer","8","4","20","13 June 2009"," Not for the Star Trek purists, but it's still enjoyable.
","I have seen all the Star Trek shows and movies, so I am well aware of how all the shows fit together. However, this new Star Trek movie really doesn't concern itself with fitting as much as capturing the interest of a new generation of film goers. Because of that, while the show has many similarities to the old, it actually ends up re-writing the series because, based on this movie, everything to come is actually re-written. In the Star Trek of the original series, The Next Generation, the movies, etc. there will no longer be a planet Vulcan and the Romulans will also cease to exist--as Vulcan was destroyed mid-way through this film and the coming destruction of Romulus is shown as well. For the Trekkies out there, this is heresy. They will say ""Spock's mom CAN'T die in this film--I saw her in ""Journey To Babel"" episode in the original series AND this series is supposed to come AFTER this Star Trek movie. All this is very true, but most newer fans will care less. Plus, some of the older fans may accept the notion of Romulans from the future going back in time to destroy Vulcan--thus undoing much of what we saw over the years.<br/><br/>I could go on and describe the plot but frankly, with a bazillion reviews already for the film, what's the point?! Let's talk about the technical and story aspects of the film. Despite being told that the film was character-driven, I still think the film relied too much on special effects. They were gorgeous and it's obvious they spent a fortune to make the film. The problem, though, is that since all the crew members are brand new to the ship and don't know each other, there is no chemistry between them as of yet. This is something they'll have to create in future films--and hopefully they won't forget to do this. Now, there are just germs of what these characters will eventually be. It's nice to see that they remembered characters like Christopher Pike and the rest, too. What I don't understand, though, and it just didn't seem to fit was this odd romantic pairing of Uhura and Spock. Where did this come from anyway?! There was no hint of this on the show and having the emotionally controlled Spock in the clinches with her made no sense. Now, having the galactic horn-dog Kirk try, on the other hand, was believable--very believable! From a 40-something guy who loved the shows, I only mildly liked the movie. It's not for the die-hard purists but is entertaining and fun...and probably more for younger and more forgiving audiences."

His reboot is respectful of the original, but has enough ingenuity, humor and thoughtfulness to fill in the gaps left open by the originals. Examples: Kirk's birth and background, McCoy's nickname. Loved the homage to the iconic ""red shirt"" scene during the space jump. Olsen was wearing a red suit, predicting his imminent demise.

This movie ensures that the Enterprise will be boldly going wherever the hell it wants to for more than the foreseeable future. This is a celebration of all things Star Trek. <br/><br/>The Writing:<br/><br/>I saw this at the Writer's Guild Theater in LA. This is a tough audience I can tell you. After the first ten minutes or so the atmosphere was like a bunch of giddy kids at a matinée. If you can have critical bitchy-ass writers in the pocket with you, laughing at all the laugh points and oh sh*ting at all the oh sh*t points, you know you have a well-written script. <br/><br/>And the script is great. It's got a bunch of Trek friendly stuff all woven together as an origin story. You got the Khan like character in an unrecognizable Eric Bana. You have a black hole creating globule thingy. You have a parallel life/universe thingy. You have an original cast member blessing the new crew thingy. And all the thingies work perfectly together. Oh and Christopher Pike, the original Captain of the Enterprise, follow that thread and you will find one of the most original, challenging and heart-full double episodes of television ever. <br/><br/>The Cast: <br/><br/>When I first saw Chris Pine was going to be the new Captain Kirk, I thought what a loser, he has a terminal case of gay face. Boy, was I wrong. He is and I mean this as the highest compliment you can give a performer, Shatneresque. Yes, I coined the term may it Live Long and Prosper. He has equal amounts of cocky, clown, pomposity, tough guy, not as good as he thinks he is womanizer, grim bastard when it comes down to it and able to see the right thing to do from A to Z without going to B or the rest of the effing alphabet. He is, like Shatner, the ultimate man of action. Green bitches everywhere beware.<br/><br/>Zachary Quinto owns the role of Spock on his own terms and it works. In some ways it is his movie as much as anybody else's. Karl Urban is channeling Deforest Kelly and I love it. John Cho is fantastic as Sulu. Zoe Saldana keeps the soul of ship safe as Uhura. Anton Yelchin is spot on as Chekov. And Simon Peg rules as Mr. Scott. These actors love these characters as they were originally played and they celebrate their acting opportunities as if they were given Ferrari's to drive. <br/><br/>Oh and they even give mad love to the obligatory doomed crewman on the initial bad guy thingy destruction attempt. <br/><br/>The Directing:<br/><br/>You know what? I didn't notice it. I was too busy watching the movie.<br/><br/>Gene Roddenberry created something Shakespearean with Star Trek. The soul of what he created is so strong that it will last as long as we do, provided it is in the right hands. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams got the hands, friends.<br/><br/>A total Adrenaline and Endorphin release with Heart and a Bright Future. <br/><br/>What heading Captain?<br/><br/>Out there. That away."

","Definitely no spoilers, because I would be just as mad as you would be if I had gone to that movie know what would happen.... It's a real surprise!<br/><br/>There are no words to express what I feel this movie is. Incedible, Action-packed, edge of your seat-feel, and so hilarious are only the beginning. As for action-packed, I have never seen a movie go so fast, but yet be so enthralling.<br/><br/>But I believe my favorite part was the humor. If characters like McCoy, Chekov or Scotty weren't there, I wouldn't be writing this or maybe even liked the movie. Right when you're about to topple over from excitement and adrenaline, one of them cracks a line that makes the whole audience relax, but not lose the feel of the movie. It flowed so good with the plot too, perfectly placed and laugh-out-loud funny. Also, good to mention that many TOS quotes were used while not losing their touch in such a modern story. <br/><br/>The CGI was incredible, but not overpowering. It made it feel so real and so amazing. Another good point was the music... If you have a chance to pull yourself out of Vulcan or the Enterprise or even Iowa for a minute and just listen to Michael G.'s music, you'll be blown away. It really enhances this movie and makes it better than anything I could've imagined. <br/><br/>Again, I feel at a loss for words. Just go see it in theaters, or if you can, IMAX. <br/><br/>This movie is a thriller I hope no one will ever forget."

","I love the Star Trek franchise so much I want to see a new Star Trek series! A lot of fan hopes are riding on this film! The reason for a ten star review! To drive this point home - I actually stopped watching television programing completely once Enterprise (the last Star Trek series) went off the air about 5 years ago! And, I have literally watched every TV episode (and film) of every Star Trek series, in real time, since its inception in 1966! I also collect rare vintage Star Trek memorabilia, have heard Leonard Nimoy, and many others involved with Star Trek, speak at various Science Fiction Conventions from the early 1970's to the present, and I subscribe to a Star Trek fanzine, ""Trexperts,"" edited by a one dedicated Star Trek fan, which is still mailed all over the world! Needless to say, the Star Trek universe has had a huge impact on my life!<br/><br/>I sincerely hope someone from Hollywood reads this review! In the long run (and that's what Star Trek is all about) you're not going to win new fans by dumbing down Star Trek Into a comic book story solely to satisfy the fickle teen market! I realize a lot of the previous 11 Star Trek movies have been box office flops (and for good reason!) because IT'S ABOUT THE STORY, STUPID! Sure the special-effects-eye-candy is spectacular, the cinematography does not disappoint and the design of the sets are absolutely amazing! The acting ranged from perfect (the New Captain Kirk & Leonard McCoy) to sufficient (the new and original Mr. Spock). And, all the supporting cast certainly held their own! But the story was so unimaginative and preposterous, it came across as nothing more than contrived cardboard drivel.<br/><br/>It kind of boggles the mind! There are absolutely an endless number of Science Fiction themes that run through all the various Star Trek episodes. What more do you want? You have about 26 YEARS worth of episode ideas to choose from! Then there are plenty of ideas Star Trek has not explored which is summarized in a single 900+ pages book covering all Science Fiction ever written in any language in the world: ""Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction, Fifth Edition."" It doesn't take a rocket scientist (pun intended) to do the research to come up with new and wonderful ideas! But no! The Spineless Chickens at Paramount had to make a film with as much delight and imagination as the last Star Trek movie dud! What an incredible insult to all the Star Trek fans that have spent their time and money supporting Star Trek over the years by watching only God knows how many vapid TV commercials or spending their money on film tickets, videos, DVD sets, books & fan magazines, convention tickets and Star Trek memorabilia! <br/><br/>Ironically, just two days a ago I rushed out to see the brilliant science fiction animated film, Battle for Terra, before it was yanked out of the theater to make room for ""Star Trek."" It's hard to believe, but it was showing on a mere single screen in a metropolitan area with about 1.5 million people! Despite the magnificent animation, storyline, and acting - staring both Danny Glover and James Garner (of all people!), it was a miserable flop at the box office. Why? Because the story was both too imaginative and gutsy! Something the Star Trek franchise once was like - a long, long time ago! I can only pray that in the future Hollywood's goal of maximizing profits does not win out over substance and delight!"

","Wow! JJ Abrams picked a magnificent team to lead him in directing one of the best Star Trek films ever.

The casting was also done with forethought and originality.<br/><br/>I support whole heartedly the track of the story and see many more movies in the future. As long as the directors producers and crew of the Enterprise stay committed to the characters they resurrected, they will have both the new audience and the fans that kept Star Trek alive all these years.<br/><br/>To the loyal fans: If there is any hints of disappointment, take time to watch the film again. JJ Abrams created a story and ending that suggests forward thinking. If you take time to ""step out of the box"" you will understand the 'whys' and reasons of this marvelous, action-packed, superb special effects and creative writing, you will more than pleased and feel a sense of pride.<br/><br/>Star Trek lives!

","Outstanding and brilliant! In terms of comparison to a 'non-epic Star Trek Film' it had amazing CGI, thorough immersion, smooth plot and character establishment, and exciting build up. Now, let's talk about how a modern day movie could contain the old Star Trek crew, without William Shatner and the ridiculous computer sounds. It didn't try. This film didn't compete with old ideas and characters. It applauded them, it celebrated them! If you enjoyed the original Star Trek series you'll love every actor they cast (especially Bones, wow!) You'll want to jump out of your seat at cryptic references to the original episodes and adventures. The technology has been updated thank God, but in a very comfortable way. NCC-1701 is definitely a vision of the future from current day technological theory, but it still looks vintage and again, applauds the ship from the first series. I would equate it to how the Prowler is a modern car, but celebrates the old muscle cars. I so enjoyed this film that I'm going to see it in the theater several more times. I love seeing a movie that gets a hesitant standing ovation and lasting applause. How infrequent it happens today. Well done, cast and crew, well done!"

","Let's face it, in an age where every older film is being remade and lazily altered slightly, I wasn't for a second expecting this. Absolutely blew my socks off. This film is everything I could ever want from the franchise and more. <br/><br/>Not only did they capture the essence of the characters from the original films/series, they added depth and new direction. The old universe is turned on its head and the very well written story keeps you gripped. Kirk and Spock fit very well and the twist on their relationship is woven in so well, you feel like you are watching a brand new sci-fi genre. <br/><br/>If ever people wanted to understand the ingredients for a good remake, this is the perfect combo. If you love Star Trek and you hate crap remakes, this is the film for you. Stunningly good, I didn't want the film to end. <br/><br/>Great bad guys with a purpose, great good guys not tied to their predecesors and a story that makes you yearn for more."

","The casting of Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock was perfect. Pine was great as this cocky up and comer and Quinto had the whole speech pattern down and look of the Vulcan. I liked the plot for the most part. It's about how Kirk and his fellow shipmates got their start on the USS Enterprise and how they landed their positions. They are battling the evil Nero whom is using red matter to create black holes to wipe out whole planets. But the whole part with this being a future Nero and a future Spock I didn't like.

It is like and adrenaline shot to the heart and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. The story is very interesting, It tells us the beginning of the friendship between James Kirk and Spock between the seek of vengeance from the Romulan people for the destruction of their planet. Director J.J. Abrams manages a mind blowing film with a fast paced rhythm making a enjoyable movie. The spacial effects and the CGI are awesome, maybe one of the best I've ever seen. The cast is very good, Chris Pine is very good as James T. Kirk, Zachary Quinto delivers a wonderful performance as Spock, Jon Cho was good as Sulu, it was a really good surprise to watch him in a more serious role, Eric Bana as the villain Nero was convincing enough, Zoe Saldana looked spectacular and acted excellent and at last but not least the special appearance from Leonard Nimoy as Future Spock was really spectacular.

"jonnygs","5","2","8","2 June 2009"," Someone needs to slow down the Star Trek
","J.J. Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek series is a nice departure from the talkiness and corniness of the previous Star Trek films. Abrams had done a good job of making this Star Trek more exciting, filming more action and less debate about intergalactic policy. Also, the aliens are not men in alien suits (see the original TV. show). The look of the film has been updated to feature sharp white modern architecture and slick costumes. The acting is quite convincing and the cast is new (with the exception of Leonard Nimoy's cameo as future Spock, more on that later). Spock's logical reasoning is balanced nicely with the bluntness of Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the humor of Scotty (Simon Pegg). The film isn't heavy handed, nor is it philosophical. It's not dark like The Dark Knight; instead it's a pure, feel-good action flick. That's not to say the film is devoid of problems. While J.J. Abrams may have a good sense of visuals, and a better sense of action, his sense of pacing is not as well polished. The opening scene, which sets up Kirk's motivation to join Star Fleet, feels clichéd and odd. The set up is quite familiar; the main character's motivation comes from having recognized their father's sacrifice and the son tries to live up to his father's legacy. The first act, and part of the second act of the film is not that interesting because Abrams spends most of that time introducing us to characters that we know are coming. This problem may be inherent to a franchise reboot (see Batman Begins), but Abrams spends too much time with introductions. It is only the third act that shuffles between the very exciting and the averagely entertaining. In an unexpected turn, romance enter the narrative, and although giving this aspect too much focus would be bad (kudos to Abrams for recognizing this), a certain attraction between two very unexpected characters that is shown but never explained at all, is distracting. Leonard Nimoy makes a cameo appearance as Spock from the future, in a hard to understand turn that seems to function only to solve a plot hole. (His introduction is preceded by a pointless scene of action) Star Trek's real problem is that it keeps the audience at an arm's length. We never really get close with any of the characters and I did not feel any involvement. While the CGI was very well done, the film's glossiness and futuristic feel are alienating to the viewer and the film makes little impression once it's over. Star Trek is no The Dark Night, but it is a mildly satisfying feel-good action film. Star Trek seems geared towards a sequel, and let's hope that J.J. Abrams returns; hopefully he takes a page from Christopher Nolan's book (see The Dark Knight) and not the Wachowski brothers' book (see Matrix Reloaded)."

","Does your comment mean you like the film or do you not like the film. I am unsure of what it is you are saying when you posted about an hour ago. As for me I have been a trekie for about 25 years now. I like the action and the film expect there were problems with it. One being that Vulcan has been to involved in the franchise to be destroyed. Two by Nero coming back in time the Borg would have destroyed the federation and the Romalans as well because the right people would not have been in place to stop it in the future. Lastly to create a couple of black holes so near earth would defentiley cause a lot of problems that I do not think would have easy answers to fix. One of them being that earth would be suck up by it. Even with Spock wraping to a new destination before the red matter exploded. Any thoughts on this out there?"
"Shadowwwolf","9","2","8","27 May 2009"," An Action Packed Thrill Ride
","I have always liked Star Trek. It wasn't the original series that did it for me though, that was before my generation and I have never seen it. I have actively followed 'Voyager' and 'Enterprise', though. And I do have an affection for Jean-Luc, even if I have never really watched 'The Next Generation'. I did however see all the movies with the TNG crew.<br/><br/>I do not have to much knowledge of the original series. Nor did I ever took the time to watch it, or examine it's storyline and characters. So flaws in the story didn't bother me. In fact, I did not even notice them. I had seen a lot of trailers and promotional material before it came out, and I was looking forward to it a lot. Usually I have a bit of a skeptical feel about reboots as these. Who can blame me for that though? Most reboots do fail miserably. I won't call any names (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The horror! The horror!)<br/><br/>I did however not feel skeptical about this movie. The promotional material, the cast, the director. They all seemed fit for the job. The trailers are fantastic and got me very psyched about this movie. I had the feeling it was going to be fantastic.<br/><br/>My feeling was right.<br/><br/>It's a spectacular movie. It does almost everything like it's supposed to. The story is a bit messy at times, granted. But this movie doesn't focus too much on the story, something that might turn off Star Trek fans. This movie is an action packed thrill ride. The action is very plentiful, it has lots of great humor, and it looks brilliant. <br/><br/>The ships are no longer sluggish war boats. All the battles are fast paced dogfights. And it all looks really slick. The CGI is truly amazing. And the ships look fantastic on the inside as well. J.J. said it makes the Ipod store look uncool. It does. There's a lot of lens flare's going on. At first I was afraid it would annoy me, but it fits in really nicely and adds a lot to that futuristic feeling.<br/><br/>The casting is spot on. They couldn't have done a better job here. Chris Pine as Kirk is lovely. He really delivers as a young, witty, arrogant lady killer. Quinto is maybe even better as Spock. Creating a fantastic Spock with a fantastic background. Pegg is also great as Spocky, hilarity assured. John Cho worked pretty well as Sulu, but sadly he didn't get as much screen time as he deserved. The same counts for our villain Nero, portrayed by Eric Bana. <br/><br/>This is not to say the movie is without it's flaws. The story feels a bit weak to me. And some things could've been made more obvious. The Narada is really powerful, but in the movie it's never explained why. Which makes it hard to believe it's only a mining vessel. Even if it's from the future. It is however actually outfitted with Borg technology. Then there's the science which has some flaws. Like a supernova happening in mere hours, or black holes that are actually visible. (Which is impossible, since they suck in all matter including light.)<br/><br/>These things didn't bother me at all though. And you can count on this movie to be a joy to watch. It's great blockbuster. It delivers on pretty much every point, and does everything you want it to do. <br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that it appeals to everyone. You could actually take your girlfriend to this movie without feeling like a geek! I can realise some Trekkies might not be happy with this movie, as it maybe does disregard some of the original story. But really, why is that so important? Star Trek got rebooted after all. Did you really want another disaster like Nemesis? I think not. A movie that appealed to everyone is exactly what this series needed. And it reboots Star Trek in a glorious way.<br/><br/>9/10"
"cshep","9","2","8","19 May 2009"," WOW! and What ?
","Well, if you wanted a NEW Star Trek Generation, then you have it ! Not since DC Comics invented the Alternate Universe theory, and all of the problems it created, we have the same dilemma, just a film away. While this Star Trek creates a new time-line, it gets really complicated, because it invalidates ALLOT of what you saw on the TV show. Bad guy Nero(Eric Bana) in an intimidating performance, wants to get revenge for the destruction of his Romulan planet, due to a solar blast. Now it really gets weird, the original Spock was on his way to stop the solar explosion, and I think he succeeds, because he creates a black hole in order to stop planet Romulus from being erased, but this creates a black hole in which Spock and Nero and crew get taken back thru time.. But , apparently Nero doesn't get the message and goes on a killing spree, destroying Federation Starships at will, and also Planet Vulcan, and another 6 Billion Vulcans, this takes place in the past or current day storyline. Those are the only spoilers I am going to reveal. The film stands on its on merits, and the acting is quite good. Chris Pine as James Kirk, and Zachary Quinto as young Spock are quite admirable.Simon Pegg is a hoot as Scotty. The story is only o.k. if you are a fan of the original TV and films. If you are a new comer, you will be more likely to accept the premises that are now the new time-line. I enjoyed the special effects, and the galactic approach to its(the films producers) thinking. Very big on scope ! But, the rest is in the hands of the Trekkie's to either embrace or ignore the new story lines, only time will tell. With ALL of the plot holes, I can't see how the storyline will hold up, it can't support its own weight. I gave the film a 9 on overall effort, not for the inevitable downfall."

","Star Trek: I've seen all the TV shows and all the movies. The one is a good starting point to get the new series rolling again in much the same way Star Trek, The Motion Picture did in 1980.<br/><br/>If you'll notice above I said this review MAY contain spoilers. I can't be sure because in order to give away a plot point there would have to be a plot and there's not much of one here. Something about space ships and time travel and some guy who's real mad about something.<br/><br/>Cast: They did a good job of matching new young actors to old established characters. However it seems to me that there's something wrong with that. We're trying to get someone to play a role as an actor playing a character, rather than an actor playing a role.<br/><br/>Writing and plot. Not much of a plot, it might get in the way of the CGI.<br/><br/>Dialog and scenes were OK, but things like Spock smooching with Uhura on the transporter was way out of character and it almost made me sick to my stomach. And not only that, Scotty didn't say ""Captain, I canna change the laws of physics"" <br/><br/>Special effects and CGI: That's the idea, isn't it? <br/><br/>Overall: Not bad given the constraints the director had to work under. I give it a 6/10. But let's face it, it's odd numbered it can't be any good."
"valek12","10","2","8","18 May 2009"," A fantastic film
","Let's get some things straight. I am not a ""Trekkie"". I did not like the original television series and when stating how fantastic it was, people need to realise that it was canceled due to low ratings after 3 seasons. 10 years later Star Trek: The Motion Picture was released, giving the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise a new lease on life that the early 70s animated show could not. I enjoyed Star Trek, Wrath of Kahn and Search for Spock, but was let down tremendously by the three films that followed.<br/><br/>When Generations was released in late 1994 i was blown away. Always a fan of sci-fi and with the first and only official team up of Picard and Kirk, Generations reinvigorated the franchise, like it or not. First Contact, Insurrection and Genesis were absolutely terrible attempts to milk the franchise. How many times can the Enterprise go up against a far superior ship and have the crap beaten out of it for 90 percent of the third act only to magically survive the battle? That gets me to the film I saw just this past weekend. JJ Abrams is responsible for some of the worst television in the history of the little square box, but somehow he had me sucked into this masterpiece. Yes, during the action scenes he likes to move the camera so much that you can't see anything, but the intricate story, casting, sets and dialogue more than covers his penchant for ""shaky cam"".<br/><br/>Quinto is a perfect fit for Spock, like Patrick Stewart was born to play Charles Xavier (Professor X) the same could be said for Quinto. Simon Pegg adds a light to the cast that off sets the conflict between Spock and Kirk. Eric Bana has come such a long way since ""Poida"" and ""Chopper"". As Nero he commands the camera to follow his every move.<br/><br/>As with Generations, JJ Abrams Star Trek will introduce a new audience to wonders of the Enterprise and races like Vulcans, Romulans and eventually Klingons (Sequel anyone). What this film will also do is see newer fans buying DVD and Blu-Ray Special Editions of the original films and therefore keeping the Star Trek merchandising machine alive and well for generations to come.<br/><br/>One last thing: People on here talk about Gene Roddenberry rolling over in his grave over this new Star Trek film. How completely insensitive can you be? using the man who created something you love as merely a passing insult to the new film. You should feel ashamed of yourselves. You whine about Star Trek not being better and then crap all over the memory of its creator. Freedom of speech is all well and good but insulting someone who has passed away is still insulting them. Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Enterprise were atrocious and in my opinion much worse than this new film. But everyone seems to skip over that those television shows were made years after Roddenberry passed away, therefore raping the legacy he left.<br/><br/>Go and see Star Trek if you enjoy good films. Do not look for problems or you will find something to have a problem about. Open your eyes and ears and be transported into another world. That is, after all, the reason we watch films."
"solid-snake2070","9","2","8","18 May 2009"," Star Trek is back !
","JJ Abrams has resurrected Star Trek with his own angle on the series. The new Star Trek delivers a well written plot along with a perfect casting that suits the characters.<br/><br/>In the year 2387, Ambassador Spock pilots a ship containing red matter. With the threat of a supernova nearby, the red matter is capable of creating a black hole that would soon enough draw the supernova to it. Before Spock succeeds, the unexpected happens when the supernova explodes and destroys Romulus, the Romulan home world. Spock then soon escapes the scene after a miner ship captained by Nero wants to avenge the loss of his home and family. However, both their ships are sucked into the black hole traveling into different times of the past creating an alternate reality. The Narada, Captain Nero's ship, arrives 154 years before the supernova and attacks a nearby Federation starship, the USS Kelvin. Acting captain of the USS George Kirk orders an evacuation of his ship after suffering a devastating attack by the Narada. Kirk stays behind covering the fleeing shuttle crafts, including one with his wife giving birth in. In the dying moment, Kirk hears the cry of his son and his ship collides with the Nerada, saving 800 lives including both his son and wife. <br/><br/>Growing up fatherless, James Kirk shows an inherited intelligence, and rebellion. After a bar fight with a number of Starfleet soldiers, Captain Christopher Pike tries to convince him to join the Starfleet with the heroic antics of his father. After three years in Starfleet, Kirk had befriended cadets Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and the beautiful Uhura. At the academy, Kirk is accused of cheating on a test program and is then faced by his accuser, Commander Spock. During Kirk's hearing, Starfleet receives a signal from the Vulcan planet. The cadets then are ordered to go help the Vulcans while Kirk ignores his academic suspension with the help of Bones. Kirk is smuggled on the USS while Spock soon tries to save his family, only for his mother to die along the deteriorating planet. Then, Spock and Kirk beam aboard the Nerada saving the captured Captain Pike and then releasing the red matter that would eventually destroy Captain Nero and the rest of the crew.<br/><br/>The film had a well rounded plot that had its own twists. As you followed the details throughout it, you felt excitement and wanted to see more. The casting perfectly suited the characters. Chris Pine (James T. Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock) had great chemistry that made you sense the rivalry and tension both their characters had at the beginning. The action JJ Abrams employed was anything but ""illogical"". It was a well directed film that had the pace and visual images that unfolded in every scene within its momentum and intensity. The visual effects were stunning and believable. The CGI effects did not look cheap as it showed the amount of effort the working people dedicated. To sum up, JJ Abrams did Star Trek a fair job which in my opinion every Star Trek and non Star Trek fan would enjoy. It is a must see movie that has revitalized the series."
"redeyedtreefrog","8","2","8","18 May 2009"," Pleasant Surprise
","Though I am only 33 I do love the original Star Trek. I practically cursed the making of this movie. I was afraid that like so many other remakes they would dishonor the original. My curiosity was heightened by the summary on this very site and so I took the plunge and went to see it on big screen. I am glad I did and I hope others will follow. The original show was limited to three seasons. The redemption came when they started doing the movies. Along with the original Star Trek I enjoy Next Generation and Voyager. I was, although, disappointed with the last season of Voyager. There were always parts of the original crews life that were mentioned but went no further - for example, the test that Kirk took three times or where Bones got that designation. I was shocked when I saw Eric Bana. At first I was wondering when he was going to show and then I realized I was looking at him. The Uhura and Spock thing was the biggest surprise of all. Well done guys and girls."
"prehistoricplague","7","2","8","17 May 2009"," So on a night when you're feeling brain dead, go see this.
","I give it a seven not because its a star trek film, not because it actually followed the story, not because it had correct character personalities and development, not because as a Trekkie I was satisfied, but because it's mindless entertainment and has (SPOILER) evil miners from the future (END SPOILER) Okay, I loved Star Trek as a kid, I watched it with my dad all the time. This was not Star Trek, this was not even close to Star Trek (minus names and maybe young Spock when he wasn't making out with Uhura) I think they watched the entire Star Wars and were drunk on Lucas fumes the night they threw this story together.<br/><br/>Alrighty, so Trekkies now know they will be highly disappointed, I've said my two cents on that account, now moving on.<br/><br/>I went to this movie, late at night, not really concerned as a Trekkie (I already saw what Hollywood did to Wolverine, being also an xmen fan) that I was actually going to get Trek out of this film. And I wasn't disappointed on that account, because I certainly got no Trek.<br/><br/>What I got was mindless entertainment (which is what I usually go to movies for anyway) and that's exactly what I needed to enjoy this movie. I went expecting absolutely nothing and got a lot of random somethings, then a lot of big black (plot) holes of nothing. I actually enjoyed myself, I laughed a bit, was awed a bit by the fantastic CG in some parts, rolled my eyes grinning at the sewage plant they had at the base of the ship, and was pleasantly inspired to go home and play video games when Scotty was suddenly swept down a pipe in an obvious game of Mario charades.<br/><br/>Good entertainment, pretty good acting, good effects, nice music. So grab a popcorn, a soda and maybe some candy, sit back in your comfortable (or not so comfortable theater seat) and prepare to turn off your brain and enjoy it for what it is. Entertainment with no merit, who cares, it's Hollywood, it's time to stop being surprised by the fact that many movies coming out of there seem to be made on a night of booze and playboy.<br/><br/>If you're not one to mindlessly enjoy yourself, then good like finding a director that will actually do Star Trek right, until then I am happy with my old series, I don't need it to be made into a movie. :) I enjoyed myself, I always try to enjoy myself in a movie, this movie is not a BAD movie, I know when I have seen a bad movie (ex. Jaws 3D) and I'll rate it so. But this movie was enjoyable to a degree, just don't see it for a Star Trek film, clearly by the reviews on this site it should be obvious to you already that you will just want your money back."
"asaf1492","8","2","8","16 May 2009"," Better than the previous movies; not as good as the TV shows
","First of all, I'm not a complete Trekkie. Meaning, I've watched some of the first series episodes as a child, all the new TNG episodes, and from there on all the rest of the spin offs. I've also watched all TNG movies. Having said that, I can honestly say this movie is far better than previous movies. First of all, the idea of restarting the series is a good one: taking young, relatively unknown and hungry actors, instead of those who have already made one movie too many. Casting is very good, and so is acting. I especially liked young Spock, Zachary Quinto, who has managed to put some depth to this old character. Young James Kirk is also adequate, but his role isn't very complex and interesting to begin with. The movie itself is interesting; plot is good and relatively original, and the concept of parallel universes affords a new beginning for future come. This movie isn't annoyingly self-righteous (like ""Star Trek: Insurrection""). It does not unnecessarily seek to rock the old boat by killing beloved characters (""Star Trek: Nemesis"", what a disgrace). It does what it is supposed to do: reignite the show. No doubt, new movies will appear, and it is not far-fetched to assume that in the future, a new young Captain Pickard will show up on the big screen. However, this movie, like its predecessors, is by no means complicated and inspiring. It does not teach us anything new, nor does it give us something to reflect on. After all, JJ Abrams does a good solid work in making a show; but as interesting as ""Lost"" is, one can hardly say it is complex or that it constitutes as ""food for thought"". If you want complexity, something to reflect on, go to the old TNG episode. Check out ""Parallels""; ""Ship in a Bottle""; ""Conundrum""; ""Yesterday's Enterprise""; and my favorite, ""The Inner Light"". Each of those episodes is much more complex than any Star Trek movie, sometimes even ""mind blowing"". Is it because such ideas aren't suitable for general public, not commercial enough? Perhaps. In summation, if you want the best, go for the old reruns – and not only of TNG, but also of Voyager, Enterprise and DS9. If you want a couple of hours' fun, go see the new movie. You know what? Go watch it anyway. Zachary Quinto is certainly worth it."
"jaredmobarak","9","2","8","11 May 2009"," You can whistle real loud  Star Trek
","Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman showed they could do serious action with Mission Impossible III, but the campiness of Transformers gave me trepidation that their reboot/prequel Star Trek might lose its way. However, with a guy like J.J. Abrams at the helm to steer the ship, I never should have lost faith. The origin story for all your favorites like Kirk and Spock is everything you'd hope it could be. The humor is great, the effects spectacular, the acting really good, (thank you for not making Chris Pine do a William Shatner caricature), and the story intricate in its own rite, being deeper than just a throwaway film to introduce people and set up a sequel. And who would have thought Karl Urban and Simon Pegg shouting out fan favorite lines as Bones and Scotty respectively could actually fit in and not seem forced or cheesy. Star Trek is back and better than ever; good job Paramount for giving the con to an admitted Trekkie novice who's outside perspective was just what the series needed.<br/><br/>In any lesser hands, Star Trek could have fallen prey to the origin story syndrome of so many, spending too much time on characters that most know a lot about, leaving the plot and ultimate climax to suffer. How many times do you get a great story full of exposition only to see a beloved villain get wasted in the first film, with an epic battle becoming little more than a whimper? Orci and Kurtzman seem to understand this fact and therefore create a whole new creature to act as antagonist. Captain Nero is a Romulan who has accidentally been sent from the future through a black hole, looking for revenge on the man he holds responsible for the annihilation of his home world. He is a wild card unknown to the Federation, someone with a superior ship and weapons, a force for which no plans exist to confront him. He is the perfect adversary to help vault James Tiberius Kirk into the Captain's chair on the Starship Enterprise. Nero can't be reasoned with, he must be reacted to in kind, with as much improvisation as possible. No one is better at going into a fight undermanned and underpowered, yet still feeling as though he has the advantage, than Kirk.<br/><br/>But even though he is an egomaniac, too smart for his own good and bad boy demeanor, he must learn to trust and rely on those around him, even if they disagree. Not having ever watched the original television series, but having seen a couple of the films, I always did found it interesting that someone so cavalier as Kirk could be so close of friends with a Vulcan like Spock, pretty much unemotional, by the books, and unrelenting in his logic. Here we get the answers. We learn about Spock's interspecies parents—Vulcan father and human mother—and how the two races have affected his internal structure and emotional gauge. We also see Kirk's hardnosed childhood without a father in backwoods Iowa, a chip perpetually on his shoulder. It is an adolescence brought on by the ripple through time Captain Nero has caused, coincidentally being the direct reason for Kirk's father's death in this alternate reality. Whereas ""Lost"" posits that the past cannot be changed, Star Trek not only says in can, but also does so without warning. The crewmembers you know from old discover each other, find their way onto the Enterprise through aptitude or sheer dumb luck, and discover the strengths they each possess, forming the bonds and work ethic that will keep peace in the universe for years to come.<br/><br/>The real success stories come from our trifecta of leads, Chris Pine's Kirk, Zachary Quinto's Spock, and Eric Bana's Nero. Bana brings some real malice to the role of the villain. He is an imposing figure, even more so with his introduction at the start, brooding in his chair while his right-hand man, played by Clifton Collins Jr., does the talking before he strikes. Quinto was a no-brainer choice to play Spock as his Sylar from ""Heroes"" contains similar mechanics and streamlined actions. You do miss the sly smirk that that character brings, but the tumultuous conflict of emotions battling each other behind Spock's eyes show the fire inside—the human part of him unwilling to stay buried. Watching him be so matter-of-fact with lines such as ""I'm not familiar with humans' idea of the prank"" elicits many laughs, but never at the character's expense. And Pine really shows what he is made of here. A badass, smart mouthed, punk hiding a mind and willingness to lead, his Kirk couldn't be better. With some great one-liners and perfect timing, you really start to like this kid and understand why he will become the great leader he does. You even see a little of Shatner in the role—and that's a good thing, especially since oddly timed verbal pauses weren't necessary to do so.<br/><br/>Star Trek is everything it has been built up to be. A worthy addition to the series and possible frontrunner quality-wise to the rest, Abrams has restarted the franchise and I'm sure reinvigorated the public's want for the Federation. I hope the cast and crew continues to create more, as long as the professionalism and strong storytelling stays intact. If you want story, action, science fiction, or just some good ol' Trekkie fun, go out and see it now because it's all included. All the characters are present, each developing and honing the quirks and idiosyncrasies we've grown to love from them. Not to mention many a fanboy's dream in seeing Leonard Nimoy play opposite Quinto, passing the torch onto a new generation. Television be damned, Star Trek may have some legs to make many more films, keeping the tradition alive while earning new, younger fans. This world has some more life in it after all."

To show the Enterprise clique harbors no ill will toward this star-crossed pair, Dr. Spock offers to deliver the child for just 10,000 sulus, half the going rate that Starfleet docs such as Bones normally charge.

Fortunately, at this juncture, Kirk Prime enters the room, dressed in his scrubs, admitting ""I don't know much more than HE does, but I DID stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night!"" Totally exasperated, Gaila gets off the delivery table, opting for a water birth in Shamu's tank on Water Deck Eight.

","oh dude i thought this movie was awesome, i don't know why, i don't know how, but it was super cool.<br/><br/>Chris Pine's performance and as a budding Captain James Tiberius Kirk was freaking awesome, and amazing and deliciously unself conscious, the way he's so feisty and so bold and self-assured, yet he loses practically every fight he gets into is hilarious and definitely not unlike some Jack Nicholson characters in the seventies or some Harrison Ford characters in the late 70's and early 80's. The subtle references to these characters are almost subconscious and to great effect by Chris Pine.<br/><br/>Also Spock's uptight ultra-logical unselfconscious overbearing performances is also quite pleasing, but what is more pleasing is how his character plays off with Chris Pine's character, probably one of the greatest uses of two character foils i've seen in a long time. they almost remind you of the relationship between john Lennon and Paul Mcartney, or how you would imagine Peyton Manning and Tom Brady will relate to each other within the setting of a huddle. Nonetheless, pretty cool.<br/><br/>the photography was great, the directos specifically used 35 mm lenses because they thought that a story of this setting deserved and should be told on a grand canvas, but what is even more remarkable of the photography is the beautiful contrast in the outer space shots between light and dark, and the contrasts in the opening scene between the romulan monster ship juxtaposed to the nebula shining in the background. there was also a great use of flares and quick editing reminiscent of peter jackson's use in the Lord of the rings trilogy back earlier in the beginning of the decade. what i also thought was particularly cool was how well ajob did the camera did to tell the story and complement the characters, there was a little of use of tilted cameras and hand-held shaky cameras, and quick pans and whip lashes to convey the feeling of panic and haste that the characters must have felt while on the enterprise.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was a cool movie. I liked it. It took me back to my childhood. LOL"
"dvc5159","6","2","8","9 May 2009"," Star Trek: Resurrection...
","Let me just start off by saying this is NOT your grandpa's Star Trek, or your older brother's Next Generation. This is a completely new and refreshing take on the beloved series of old, and, man, it sure delivers!<br/><br/>I am NOT a Trekkie, although I've seen most of the movies. Having said that, the story is well-told, the screenplay by Transformers penners John Brancato and Michael Ferris is solid, and there are fine and loyal performances abound. The standouts are Zachary Quinto as Spock, wise as ever, but most surprisingly Chris Pine as Kirk. His performance is one of the very best factors of the movie; not only does it show his characteristics in the series, it also adds a new trait to his already recognizable character; adrenaline junkie. The rest of the cast deliver (again) fine performances; Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, Eric Bana as the truly villainous Nero, Zoe Saldana as the gorgeous Uhura, Anton Yelchin (in a somewhat ridiculous Russian accent) as Chekov, John Cho as Sulu (good to see Cho in his first action scene), and Simon Pegg as Scotty (which is one of the very best comic-relief film characters in YEARS). Rounding up the cast is a surprise appearance by Winona Ryder as Spock's human mother, Bruce Greenwood as the Enterprise's first captain Pike, and last, but not least, Leonard Nimoy as the original Spock, whose character bridges the gap between the old and the new Trek.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that a summer blockbuster has its plot driven mostly by strong characterization, not to mention making some cheesy moments smart. I'm even more surprised that the cheese factor is very low for this one!<br/><br/>The cinematography is big in scope, the editing is fluid, and the production design is beautiful. But there are three technical aspects that deserve the highest merit for making this film great:<br/><br/>1. The special effects. Eye popping from start to finish. Immediately after the studio logos end the action starts on the screen and rarely relents from then onwards. Superbly designed, colorful, and sumptuous nonetheless, the SFX makes the action more thrilling, as the CGI is crisp and extremely realistic. So far this is a future contender for a Best Visual Effects Oscar.<br/><br/>2. Michael Giacchino's orchestral score. His music is simply epic. Throbbing, dynamic, and glorious, the man knows how to make music and definitely how to make it work. It adds tension and excitement to the film.<br/><br/>3. The film would not have been the success it would have been had it not been for one man and one man only. And that man is director JJ Abrams. Not only is he the right man for the job, his epic direction puts all the elements together to make one hell of a summer blockbuster. Really, if not for J.J., who else? So, to pen off, this is the first REAL blockbuster of 2009 (it beats the living CRAP out of the merely OKAY ""Wolverine""). It has enough action to put in three blockbusters, and it has enough effects to fill two. It has strong character development, excellent action and timing, brilliant special effects, and something new and familiar for Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike. This is the Star Trek film I've been waiting for. No cheesy lines or cheesy action. No (too) melodramatic speeches. I may not be a Trekkie, but I will definitely consider myself and others who like this film a ""Neo-Trekkie"", and will look out for the next voyage of the Enterprise, so as long as the cast and/or Abrams stay on board.<br/><br/>Welcome to the ""new"" Enterprise.<br/><br/>Entertainment value: 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: 8/10"
"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","3","15","7 January 2020"," Star Trek's First Buddy Movie
","So says young Starfleet cadet James T Kirk after his first encounter with a similarly unwrinkled Spock in the new Star Trek movie. And it's a remark that deftly sums up much of what's so very entertaining about this story of the early days of the Starship Enterprise. Directed by JJ Abrams (Lost, Cloverfield), it's a big, long, glossy film. But it's also playful, irreverent and light on its feet, and it knows exactly when to leaven the universe-rescuing with a nice nugget of humour.<br/><br/>As Kirk's barb also suggests (given that, as we all know, Kirk and Spock wind up getting on famously), the first true blockbuster of 2009 is at its core a buddy movie, and a gripping one at that. After a white-knuckle opening - more of which in a second - the film traces the childhoods of these two, similarly angry young men. Kirk is a cocky young tearaway, consumed by the death of his father; Spock, bullied for being half-human and half-Vulcan, is a real Ali with his fists.<br/><br/>When they meet, the antipathy between one (ruled by the head, but with a humane side) and the other (impulsive, but smart too) is inevitable. But it's fascinating watching the friendship slowly burgeon. And it doesn't take a diehard Trekkie - I'm certainly not - to enjoy watching Kirk (Chris Pine) trying to score with a certain Uhura (ZoÃ« Saldana) in a grim bar; ""Bones"" McCoy panicking during his first foray into space; or the newly acquired Scottie (our very own Simon Pegg) gambolling around the Enterprise like a child in a sweetshop.<br/><br/>What none of this conveys, though, is the sheer magnificence of the production design, or the thrilling choreography of so many scenes. The opening, in which Kirk's father struggles to save himself and his crew from Eric Bana's charismatic foe Nero, sets the bar very high - even Nero's ship, a sort of jagged metal octopus the size of Birmingham, is a thing of wonder.<br/><br/>Nothing in the last three Star Wars films can compete with these five minutes alone; and thereafter, whether watching Kirk and Sulu skydive from space, a rural Mid-West dotted with vast interstellar towers, or Kirk do battle with a very ill-tempered beastie on a frozen moon, it's hard not to gape in wonder.<br/><br/>Criticisms? In terms of concept, the film is hardly revolutionary. Contemporary Hollywood likes nothing better than to trace popular heroes' early days (see Batman Begins, Casino Royale, the forthcoming X-Men Origins: Wolverine, et al), and, lest we forget, it's based on a telly series that first saw the light of day in 1966. Besides, there's a notable dearth of prominent female characters, and the parallel-universe plot at times skips along a little too conveniently, at others a little opaquely.<br/><br/>But in film, as with everything, it's less what you do than how you do it, and Star Trek carries itself with immense style and heart. It benefits greatly, too, from a cast that reads like a virtual who's who of up-and-coming screen talent.<br/><br/>Besides Pegg, Saldana, and Pine (the latter solid rather than stunning), there's also Harold and Kumar's Jon Cho (as Sulu), Bourne Supremacy hitman Karl Urban (""Bones"") and, above all, Heroes villain Zachary Quinto, the straight-sets star of the movie. His Spock - who'd have thought it? - is fascinating: credibly cerebral, physically volatile, with seething undercurrents of rage. His villainous Heroes association does him no harm, but this is a rich and very different performance for which he deserves great credit.<br/><br/>The ""Old Spock"", incidentally, is played by none other than Mr Vulcan himself, the venerable Leonard Nimoy. His teeth are a little curious now, but he's a reassuringly tried-and-tested presence in this very modern movie, and it's he who gets to deliver the closing, time-honoured Star Trek voiceover. And yes, this genuinely spectacular film does wrap with the most famous split-infinitive of all time. And quite right, too."

I agree with the commercial, 'This is not your father's Star Trek' We see the birth of James Kirk, building the new U.S.S. Enterprise, Leonard Nimoy returns as the older Spock. The crew meet at Starfleet Academy and train for three years. An evil time-traveling Romulan named Captain Nero alters the past to mess up the future.

The actors are well cast and most of them get a new subtle twist which to me adds more character depth. They have taken the old school star trek characters, knocked off the dust and brought out a series of characters that we can all get behind again. This movie is a must see and even folks that are not real trekies will have no problem getting involved in the story lines, action, and energy of this movie.

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","3","15","7 May 2009"," It's so good I had to see it twice, and I'm not a Trekkie. A landmark accomplishment.
","The science fiction genre hasn't seen a real landmark hit in quite a long time. It seems like people have been waiting for a movie to invigorate the genre again, bringing back the feelings of the glory days of the 1980's, when Star Trek, Star Wars, and other science fiction landmarks like Blade Runner reigned supreme. Well, the new 2009 version of 'Star Trek' appears to be the film to take up the mantle this time around, mixing together a blend of science fiction and action, sprinkled with a bit of comedy, and topped with a dose of humanity.<br/><br/>Before we get into this, I'd like you to know that I've never seen an episode of Star Trek, and I've only seen one other movie (The Wrath of Khan). However, this didn't affect my viewing experience for the worse, in fact, it made it even better, as I was introduced to a glorious, grand, and epic world by the action visionary J.J. Abrams. I call him visionary because his story in this film not only serves as a prequel to the longstanding series, but through his story, Abrams reinvents the story of the series without ignoring the previous landmark achievements. It's a bold, respectful, and tasteful move on his part, one Trekkies everywhere should appreciate. Through his storytelling actions in the film (and those of the writers Orci and Kurtzman), a new beginning is created for the series, one that should be cherished and embraced by fans and non-fans alike. It's a clever metaphor that you won't notice at first, but once you notice that a certain plot device is Abrams way of changing everything, it's a peaceful transition.<br/><br/>Now...the film itself. I don't think I can start anywhere other than the technical marvel of the film. It features visual effects that are flash, explosive, epic, and even some that are simple subtle changes. It boasts marvelous set decoration (Oscar worthy in fact), as each set contributes to this new, yet familiar world Abrams is creating. The design of everything is so intricate and meticulous, while it is flawlessly edited together with seamless (and sometimes flashy) transitions, backed by an Oscar worthy sound mix and escapist film score. 'Star Trek' is the most technically perfect film of 2009, and is the 2009 equivalent of 'The Dark Knight' in this regard.<br/><br/>As if it wasn't perfect enough, the cast of the movie is marketed as an ensemble (despite holding numerous high profile names and faces), and performs as such. Each character plays off the other so well, you'd think these people worked together for 10 years (and if any sequel is half as good as this is, they'll be working together a lot longer than that). Zachary Quinto is probably the best cast member of the movie, as his portrayal of Spock is exactly what the character calls for...a brilliant being that seems emotionless, but packs a world of anger, love, cunning, and wit under his motionless scowl. His counterpart Chris Pine as the legendary James Kirk is no less satisfying, as he brings the charisma, charm, and leadership presence to the character as required. Eric Bana disappears into his role as the villainous Nero, a villain who is much more than he seems. I really appreciated that he was not just a man bent on universal domination. The rest of the supporters, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Karl Urban...all fantastic.<br/><br/>'Star Trek' is a thrilling ride that will appease pretty much any kind of viewer. Despite the extreme roots in science fiction and fantasy, this is a film with even deeper roots in a more common theme - humanity. It's a movie full of raw emotion stemming from problems and conflicts we all see and maybe even deal with ourselves every day...such as the loss of a loved one, or sacrificing oneself for a greater good and cause. It's a heroic movie, a landmark in the genre that should go down as one of the best of its kind. Whether it be for the technical perfection of the film, or the enjoyable story, or for the nostalgic Trekkie to get their fix, 'Star Trek' is unmissable.<br/><br/>Though the film clocks in just over two hours, I felt like it lasted both for a lifetime, and as if that life wasn't enough. It's a movie that will leave you feeling satisfied with the story, but insatiable in that you'll hunger for more the second Abrams' name pops up on the screen. It's an adventure that will undoubtedly end up both as a classic and as a prime fixture in my DVD collection. Basically, to sum it up, 'Star Trek' is so good that it became the only movie I've ever watched twice...in one day."

","As a life-long Trekkie, I too was skeptical when I first heard about the re-boot plans. Or rather, the first rumors were about a Spock and Kirk at the Academy project, which made no sense.<br/><br/>But what came out in the end actually does make a lot of sense. Alternate timeline fits the Star Trek continuum, and if you are honest, was a missing piece so far unexplored. So it is quite logical to boldly go where no Star Trek went before...<br/><br/>It is still Star Trek, Spock is still Spock, Bones still Bones, and there finally is a Kirk that is not nauseating. Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban are wonderfully true to their roles, and the dynamic between Quinto and Leonard Nimoy is brilliant. And there is the beauty of alternative timelines: two Spocks, which is bliss.<br/><br/>Talking about the continuum, consider all of it, including the novels (yes, I am serious, I really am a Trekkie..), and then, every aspect of the movie makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>What I loved most? Spock giving more of a glimpse of who we always knew he is, and he finally gets the girl, the one who always got him, and is magnificent in her own right.<br/><br/>You may sputter and rage, but to this old Trekkie, this is great Star Trek and definitely a favorite!<br/><br/>Live long and prosper!"

"classicsoncall","8","2","9","19 January 2010"," ""Are you out of your Vulcan mind?""
","I can't tell you how many times I've mulled over various iterations of the above quote from the movie. I don't know if it's ever been used before, but I've never heard it and it was one of the genuinely fun moments of the picture for me.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, I have to say right out of the gate that time travel stories make my head hurt. Not that I can't follow them; that I can do just fine. It's just that later on, I start to think about all the ramifications of the story line I've just seen and it all starts to unravel. I've already read enough of other viewer's comments on this board to find fault with the whole concept of Prod Nero's (Eric Bana) revenge motive, so I won't go there. Suffice it to say that this 'prequel' to the Star Trek mythos might have been better served with an entirely different plot.<br/><br/>But since they went in that direction, I'm generally OK with it. The first half of the film is what got me excited, the whole back story about the origins of the characters and how they came together. The neat hook early on was when Captain Robau turned over the Enterprise during the initial attack to First Officer George Kirk, and one might have gotten the idea that it was James T; that was interesting. Seeing Kirk and Spock develop from their youth through Starfleet Academy was also cool, even if compacted for the sake of the film's run time. Where the film lost a little momentum for me was when young Kirk landed on the Ice Planet Hoth and the symbiosis with the Star Wars universe kicked into high gear. I can't really fault the film makers for taking advantage of the technology available today, but the connection was more than transparent. Once again, generally OK for the sake of a Trekkie reboot.<br/><br/>The disconnect for an old fart like myself, and perhaps a good deal more ST fans out there who were there at the beginning is how to reconcile today's advances in technology and story telling skill with the scope of the original series. I mean really, how do you expect Kirk, Spock and all the rest of the characters to boldly go where no man has gone before when they've already been there and done that. Granted, there were a lot of suspenseful TOS episodes that challenged your perceptions, but the Enterprise crew also wound up having trouble with Tribbles. So I guess you have to take it all in stride and not take it all too seriously or you can really twist yourself into a Laurentian quark.<br/><br/>So if they decide to take this prequel series on a new five year exploration to seek new life and new civilizations, I'll probably find myself along for the ride at some point. Say, wouldn't it be cool if the USS Enterprise explored an alternate reality that resulted in the creation of Gene Roddenberry? That would probably drive me right out of my Vulcan mind."
"sddavis63","7","2","9","1 January 2010"," A Well Done Re-Imagining Of The Star Trek Franchise
","When I first heard about this project, I must confess that I had my doubts. It seemed as if the Star Trek franchise had been worked to death and had run out of steam and would perhaps be better left as a memory. Why bother essentially re-making the original with all of the same characters. I must confess that I was wrong. This was very well done. Thanks to the presence of all the old characters (and I even appreciated the re-appearance of the old style uniforms from the original TV series) this had a very familiar feel to it, but the story that was developed (having to do with a Romulan who comes from the future to avenge what he perceives to be the Federation's responsibility for the destruction of Romulus) provided enough of a ""tweak"" on the characters (the time travel having altered the original timeline, of course) that while familiar this had as well a definite air of originality to it. The actors were well chosen for the roles. As the leads, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (as Kirk and Spock respectively) put their own stamps on the characters, but again still came across as the Kirk and Spock that fans of the old series remember. Even the lesser characters (McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Chekov and Uhura - they were all there) came across as ""the same but different,"" if that makes any sense. The story was well-paced and interesting. There was at times a bit of a ""Star Wars"" feel to this as opposed to a ""Star Trek"" feel, but that was presumably a reflection of the desire to appeal to a modern audience (and the earlier feature films of the franchise also fell into that tendency as well.) One thing that was lacking was any significant moral or philosophical reflection, which was often a feature of both ST and ST:TNG. This movie instead went for action, and did that well.<br/><br/>Even given the differences in the timeline explained by the opening time travel, there were some things about the story that made little sense to me. Chekov was a 17 year old ensign? (He wasn't even around in the first season of the original TV series!) This meant that he was a commissioned officer while Kirk was still a cadet. And, of course, Kirk - as a cadet - goes immediately to First Officer and then Captain of the Enterprise? That stretched credibility a bit for me. There was also the problem that the story seemed to suggest that Star Fleet recruited its cadets (or at least lifted them into space) from Iowa? Nothing against Iowa, but ...<br/><br/>In any event, the presence of Leonard Nimoy as the older Spock from the future was a nice connecting point, although one hopes that Nimoy disappears in the sequel. Nothing against him, but if this is a going to be a restart of the franchise, it's time to let the new group get on with it. Also at the end of the movie, it would have been a better choice to have the closing narration (""Space, the final frontier ..."") read by either (1) William Shatner, thus making a final connection, or, even better (2) Chris Pine as the new Kirk, rather than by Nimoy. However, on the subject of the ending, it was nice to hear the original theme music used so proudly. Good movie. It will be interesting to see if the sequel measures up and if this marks the re-ignition of the franchise. 7/10"
"bob-rutzel-1","10","2","9","19 November 2009"," A Very Satisfying Movie
","This is when and where it all began for Capt Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew. And, yes, you will be thrilled to know that they saved the Earth again. Well, for the first time, you see. <br/><br/>I have to admit that prequels do have their place. We watched the Star Trek TV series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy a while back and still we cannot get enough of this series. Here we go back in time to see how it all began, and here at the same time, we see Future Spock (Nimoy) come back from the future to give most needed advice to the young Spock (Quinto) and also to the young Kirk (Pine).<br/><br/>The acting by all, the story, cinematography, dialogue, stunts, CGI were all terrific and one couldn't ask for better. This was like a cool breeze coming at the right time on a really hot summer day. Most satisfying. Perfect. <br/><br/>However, (there is a however)we didn't see any love relationship between Spock and Uhura (Saidana) in the TV series, but in this movie there was that. That didn't fit.<br/><br/>And, of course, in our reality one cannot see and talk to oneself with one being from the future and one not, especially when one is one and the same person. But, in the reality of movies, this can be done and no one blinks an eye. Hey, we like good magic in any form. <br/><br/>All in all a great movie and very satisfying, and maybe, just maybe the series will start up again. Let's hope.<br/><br/>One more thing. Yes, they could have and should have had a place for William Shatner in this movie. And that, too, was something else that didn't fit for those of us who have watched Star Trek from its beginnings. Kind of missed him. Well, maybe in a sequel to this prequel?<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"samcascade","10","2","9","10 August 2009"," Star Trek 2009 deserves multiple viewings
","Sometimes the writers, directors, actors, technicians-- the entire ensemble gets it right, even from a fan's point of view. This is one such movie. The original Star Trek Series had, if memory serves, 76 episodes, followed by 5 feature length movies composed of the same characters. That's a lot of history-- of plot lines, dialogue, character traits, and sound tracks to honor on top of having to create an original work of their own-- a difficult to impossible task. But these guys did it.<br/><br/>If you can, take a look at this movie in an IMAX theater, for the IMAX screen gives the sense of scale this movie deserves, not to mention more digitally addressed speakers. If you're a fan of the TV series and Movies, you'll recognize constant visual, aural, and dialogue homages to the precedents-- including a slapstick bulkhead head bang by Kirk that sadly failed in Star Trek 5 but works quite well here. This in addition to some playful, over the top, and sometimes subtle touches by the actors who interpret the Enterprises Bridge Crew as younger members of star fleet(Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Sulu, Checkov, and Uhuru) as well as some episodic characters: Captain Christopher Pike, Sarek, and Amanda Grayson.<br/><br/>If I read like I'm gushing, it's because I am. There is so much in this movie to respect and enjoy that I'm only disappointed that I'm limited to 1000 words and was not a member of the production ensemble. These people did their homework and brought their spirits and hearts to the task of this movie. I, for one, am grateful"

","JJ Abrams revamp of the tired and much mocked franchise sees Star Trek re-invented for a new generation as we see how the original crew of the Starship Enterprise came together after a villain from the future changes the past and the destiny of James T Kirk.<br/><br/>There's no denying it, you've never seen Trek done like this before. Bold, brash and exciting there's no doubt this film will re-invigorate the franchise but as I said last night, I went in wanting to love it but only found it enjoyable at the most, distracting and disengaging at worst.<br/><br/>And after thinking about it, I think I know what the problem is. In trying to please both the fans of all the original series, the movies, the Next Generation and people who have no idea what Trek is, they've created a hotch potch of a continuity. The time travel element really didn't work for me at all and I found it quite insulting that (as I understand it) all the Star Trek I've watched before has now never happened. It was this that just kept bugging me throughout the film and I'm not even a big fan! It's the kind of bold ret-conning you see done in comics everyday but I don't think it worked in this instance.<br/><br/>I think the film would've worked a whole lot better as a straight prequel.<br/><br/>No time travel elements, no continuity with previous ""Generations"" and no cameo from Leonard Nimoy (as nice as it was to see him, he just served to remind how good the original cast was so after his cameo I then found myself comparing Pine, Quinto and the rest, who up to that point we're doing a good job of re-inventing their characters) Sod the continuity and the fan boys and just be brave enough to start again, from scratch. By trying to please all of the demographics, they've sacrificed the storyline.<br/><br/>Add to that some bizarre casting decisions (Bana and Pegg woefully miscast) and some very odd acting decisions (the Chekov comedy accent was overdone) and it kept on throwing me out of the movie when I wanted to be involved, this was especially the case with any scenes set in the Engine Room on the Enterprise which was obviously filmed in a factory on location. I didn't think it was especially well directed, far too many close ups to draw you in and the action scenes were a jumbled edited mess at times.<br/><br/>But despite this moaning I did enjoy the film, I just didn't love it and I think the new torch bearers made some bad creative decisions. I know I'll be in the minority but what the hell, you can't please all of the people all of the time. Perhaps I need to see it a second time? Still a 7/10"

","Basically I go to the theater without any previous knowledge such as user comments, reviews, or trailers simply because they spoil my pleasure and excitement. On the other hand, I refer to some basic information such as ratings, votes, or people in the film in order to judge whether it's a crap or a must-go.<br/><br/>""Star Trek"" got 8.4 points out of 10 by 74,479 audiences (June 2009). Demographic breakdown says more than half of viewers rated 9-10, and female viewers, who usually stay away from Sci-fi stuff, rated a bit higher than male counterparts, which could probably mean main character is a pretty boy and there is a romantic subplot.<br/><br/>According to the director's profile, this J.J. Abrams got Emmys, so he had built certain careers on TV dramas. My first impression from his pictures is that he is the son of Henry Kissinger. Jewish? Anyway I've got a hunch that he is a genius nerd type of guy who are crazy about ""Star Trek"" and good at grabbing the audiences toward the story with thrill and suspense. Anyway it's a must-go.<br/><br/>OK, I watched the Star Trek (2009). Now I skip synopsis or plot as usual; you can get it at IMDb or the official site. I'm gonna touch on my impressions or comments for your reference.<br/><br/>Actually I am not a fervent Trekkiest like Abrams, but I liked it a lot. Main plot is the revenge. The opponents had earthy reasons to attack USS Enterprise and fight against United Federation of Planets. Both main plot and other sub plots made the story involving. This is not a mere good versus evil stuff.<br/><br/>Another thing is that the quality of computer graphics of universe and star ships was superb. Especially when I saw the full-scale USS Enterprise, I found adrenaline rushed through my body. As for people, I found the young Kirk, Spok and other crews as lively and humane as the original ones. I really look forward to watching the sequel and meeting them.<br/><br/>Unless you've got a big TV set at home just like me, I recommend that you go to the theater and enjoy this master piece at a big screen."

","Congrats to the everyone involved in the production of this fine movie.<br/><br/>As an original trekker, it was great to be brought back into most of the characters I grew up with and loved. Some even making them their own and owning it (aka- Simon Pegg) !!! Ya, Chekhov was maybe a bit out there, but it fit in and added that global human element that was always a part of the original trek (not to mention a few laughs). I really like all the characters and cannot wait to see them again.<br/><br/>Really only a few minutes of cheesiness, but I did like the way L.Nimoy embraced his human side with finality in the scene with his younger self: ""Just once, forget what your head tells you and listen to your heart"". For me, that scene elevated this particular Vulcan and his potential. This will solidify the ""Alternate time-line"" approach and future productions will be wise to remember this moment. Throughout this movie, we see both sides of this character (Spock) and the conflicts that induce his dilemma and inner turmoil, but ultimately I feel that this can more or less be put aside in future episodes and utilize the powerful abilities of this unique character...<br/><br/>As for the effects, wonderful scope and production. I was worried about the ""Bouncy Camera"" syndrome as mentioned from previous reviewers, It really was not and issue for me because the pace of this film is crazy, but I will say that I hope future releases use more of the ""Stop Motion"" film technique (aka: The Matrix, 300, GIJOE, The Watchmen...). This allows the viewing audience to really see all that beautiful production without missing the effect...Kinda like going to the gallery. Everyone has a chance to interpret the images and ultimately appreciating them all the more. It is an art form after all...Oh and ""Nice Swag"" at the end as Chris Pine portrays all the confidence and flair we would expect from CAPT.James T. Kirk.<br/><br/>2 Thumbs Up all the way, Movie of the Summer !"

I don't know why but it just didn't jive with me or it may be because I've been familiar with Star Wars that I didn't even bother to take notice. However, with this new film by Lost/Alias creator JJ Abrams, I'm beginning to take the series, the whole mythology into consideration.<br/><br/>Having not been familiar with Star Trek, apart from name only, my overall impression of this film is simply incredible. It proves that you don't really have to be a fan to appreciate this film and JJ and co did a marvelous job of reinvigorating the iconic characters, settings, and that sleek and stylish as hell mother of all space vessels, the iconic and pop-culturally flavored/revered USS Enterprise. No other fictional spaceship that I know of can match the sheer inventiveness and awesomeness of this stellar craft(even more so than the Millennium Falcon and X-Wing). Plus, it also pays to have the quintessential of film; well-developed characters and plot with sharp direction and pacing of balance, something this film has a great abundance of with a side dish of morality, ethics, and bold heroism, especially from the emotionally restrained Spock (played brilliantly by Zachary Quinto). And surprise surprise, it's even cerebral on many levels!! The others do a great job as well, but I for one connected a lot more with Spock. But it was a treat to see Lenord Nimoy as the original Spock which will make fans gush with with joy. That's one of the nice things about film, seeing old friends from years back.<br/><br/>It's true there are some scenes in the movies reminiscent of the ""Star Wars"" prequels but they never drag the film down at all but rather serve the film really well unlike the prequels which were layered upon layered with action scenes that were there just for the sake of it. Not so here. The film has a nice balance of action and story, just the way a film of this caliber should be.<br/><br/>Great film, great cast, great action, great story; overall great film for the old and new generation that does a great job of acquainting newcomers to the franchise (myself included). One of the best sci-fi space epics of the year."

","(Spoilers in the last paragraph.)<br/><br/>I find it amusing to read reviews of Star Trek fans slagging off this movie. I was a big fan of Star Trek as a teenager and even though I haven't remained a big fan, I still watch some episodes now and again on TV.<br/><br/>I grew up during the TNG generation with Captain Pickard and I have to say that while I liked the series very much, let's face it, it was very nerdy and could be quite dull at times.<br/><br/>The old series, on the other hand, was loaded with action scenes, fist fights, entertaining story lines and of course a macho-type Captain Kirk who was always busy flirting with short-skirted women. THAT was Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, and it was a success. When TNG started, it gave us a bald, stuck-up captain (though a brilliant actor) and endless conversations about warp core blah anti-matter blah blah blah. Sorry, I loved the series, but I can see why so many people thought it was dull.<br/><br/>Now, the new movie brings the Star Trek universe back from the Pickard-era tech talk to the fist-fighting womanizer Kirk. Yes it appeals to a greater audience, but it does keep the very spirit of the original series. You can't make a movie just for hardcore Star Trek fans, movies are for the masses and they have to have a good story, character development, they have to be entertaining and they have to be comprehensible for a large audience and not only a selected few. I think this movie is a good mix that picks up the old Kirk-era elements.<br/><br/>For those fans complaining about how certain things don't make sense such as red matter etc: for god's sake, it's just a sci-fi movie and not a science dissertation. For me it all was pretty much plausible.<br/><br/>**WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW**<br/><br/>And those of you asking why didn't the bad guy, Nero, warn earth and the Romulans about the destruction of his planet: well, you may have a point there, but consider that if your wife dies and you are full of rage then all you think about is revenge. You don't think straight. On top of that, even if he warned them, that wouldn't bring his wife back -- it would only mean that his other self in a parallel time/universe would not lose his wife. Would that ease HIS pain? I doubt that. He just wants revenge..."

There WERE no senior officers available to fill out the bridge positions. In fact, the Enterprise was not yet even officially launched. And battlefield promotions are hardly a new thing.<br/><br/>2) Chekov's presence on the bridge. While we know he didn't appear until the second season, most everyone has decided to accept that he must have been on the ship SOMEWHERE, just not a primary bridge officer (um...Khan knew who he was...). Second, they establish that in this case he's some kind of 17 yr old wonderkind. So the timeframe, while not perfect, is a bit better.<br/><br/>3) Spock being emotional - reference The Menagerie - he was shown as more emotional when he was younger, even grinning when touching a plant.<br/><br/>4) Kissing on the transporter pad. OK, not the perfect point of decorum, but his emotions were at boiling point, and apparently you've never been a soldier, or married to a soldier, who is about to deploy somewhere dangerous.<br/><br/>5) The ""These are the voyages..."" at the end. OK, I know this is a ""TOS"" movie, but apparently folks' memory has a 25 year blind spot: This is what it has been since the start of TNG, and the end of ST VI. We should go BACKWARDS in killing sexism and return it to ""man""?<br/><br/>6) ""Admiral"" Pike. Yes, he was a Fleet Captain first time around.

"shurikensandwich","7","2","9","10 May 2009"," The 'Casino Royale' of the Star Trek franchise
","I like this movie, it's exciting...but it's no Khan. It's not even close to The Search for Spock, but more on par with some of the Next Generation films.<br/><br/>My conclusion comes from looking at the series theme as a whole, and the movie's place in that theme. Any reboot of an established legacy franchise is doomed to fail unless it captures the old magic of the original concept in a new but essentially familiar way. My thoughts...<br/><br/>What this film included that it should not have: 1. Time travel. Overdone in the franchise already. Time travel as a plot cornerstone doesn't signal 'new' or 'refreshing'.<br/><br/>2. A romantic relationship between Spock and Uhura...what?? This kind of thing was tried in the original series with nurse Chapel. It didn't work then and it doesn't work now.<br/><br/>3. Disaffected Romulans that looked like Red Wizards of Thay from D & D. We know what Romulans are supposed to look like. And now you know what Red Wizards of Thay look like.<br/><br/>4. The complete annihilation of the planet Vulcan. At least they didn't kill off a main character or destroy the Enterprise, but wiping out a founding planet of the Federation is almost as bad.<br/><br/>5. The death of Spock's mother. Minor plot device not needed.<br/><br/>6. Leonard Nemoy. Some may think the cameo by Nimoy was a nice touch for the sake of continuity, but I think it was better left out.<br/><br/>7. Super-transporters, able to beam people halfway across the galaxy, on to a ship moving at warp speed nonetheless. They don't have even this in the 25th century Trek.<br/><br/>What this film was missing that it needed: 1. Theme music worthy of a major Star Trek film. The main theme is OK, but epic space battles require epic theme music. Plus, the themes from the trailers were noticeably absent? 2. Chris Pine in about 5 years. Shatner had an overabundance of screen presence, Chris Pine not enough. Kirk seems like a kid-Captain because Chris Pine IS a kid, despite his acting, which was better than expected.<br/><br/>3. Starship interiors that look like starship interiors. Not talking the boxy sets of the 60s series here, but 2 things really stuck out as goofy. 1) An engine room that looked like the factory it was shot in. Way too spacious and 'industrial' looking. The pride of the Starfleet should look more clean and high-tech. 2) The enterprise bridge was cluttered yet sterile. I've heard it best described as the 'iBridge'. Was the main view-screen also a window? 4. Phasers that look like phasers. I always thought phasers were beams of energy? Both the hand-held and ship-mounted phasers in this movie were too much like blasters from Star Wars.<br/><br/>5. Klingons. Klingons were THE main enemy of the federation at this time. Romulans are good secondary bad guys, but the Klingons should have had at least a token appearance.<br/><br/>6. The cerebral aspect of Star Trek that we're all familiar with. A better balance of action with a richer development of the setting. The kind of thing that made one admire Star Trek as a forward looking inspiration for what the future could be if we all worked together.<br/><br/>In summary, this Star Trek is a very good movie in its own right, but not a great Trek movie. To me it is anachronistic to what Casino Royale is to the Bond film series -- well done, but still feels a bit awkward and out of place. Who knows? I felt this way when I watched the first Next Generation episode and then grew to love that series."
"lomius","9","2","9","10 May 2009"," Outstanding and fresh NEW ALTERNATE reality.
","I think too many people are passing judgment on this movie BEFORE actually SEEING it. This is NOT CANON and it does NOT try to be. It is obvious from the FIRST battle that it is an ALTERNATE REALITY story. Too many people are mad about it not being just a remake. Well I'm glad for that fact. Similar to Dark Knight or even X-Men. The whole 60s sci fi story doesn't translate completely to today. That being said... I LOVE the original series. I have watched Star Trek all my life. However, this movie was definitely a wonderful restart to that great franchise. As I said it doesn't even attempt to be CANON. It's an alternate reality from the beginning.<br/><br/>It is an awesome take on a what if scenario. Even though the core elements are still there. the main cast is there if thrown together. But that's part of what makes it great. In TOS they took years to develop the relationship they had. In this movie they were thrown into it and maximized their potential immediately which I actually liked. They didn't have time to grow they were given a life or death situation and found that despite knowing each other as in TOS that they were just destined to be a team.<br/><br/>I won't go into spoilers or anything but the action, writing, and lore just seemed to fit nicely for this reincarnation.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint its simply that the villain could have had more time or the movie longer to get a better sense of motivation for them. It was a great movie and I hope there will be more movies. Even say a trilogy to FIX the time line... That would be amazing so then it could even be canon.<br/><br/>I see so many complaints about that. But if you are a real fan of the whole series you would know that there have been tons of alternate reality stories within the series itself. So this should not be such a surprise nor a fault."
"idahovandalfan","9","2","9","10 May 2009"," To boldly go....
","I like Hollywood's current idea of rebooting rotting franchises. Christopher Nolan has done a masterful job of injecting Batman with some life. Daniel Craig has given us new reasons to root for James Bond. J.J. Abrams has now given us a fresh look at the Star Trek universe. As a fan of Alias, Lost and his work on Mission: Impossible 3 I was excited to see what Abrams would do for Star Trek. I can sum it up in one simple word, ""wow!"" <br/><br/>This fresh look at Star Trek is just what the fans needed after Nemesis left a bitter taste in our mouths. A youthful and talented cast boldly takes Star Trek to a place where no other movie dared to go. I think this movie is exactly what Roddenberry would have created in the 1960s had the technology and money been available. <br/><br/>The movie was brilliantly acted by a new young cast. Zachary Quinto as Spock is by far the highlight of the film. Quinto's previous work as Sylar on ""Heroes"" has prepared him very well for the role of an almost emotionless character of Spock. Chris Pine is fantastic as Kirk (and he even looks like a young William Shatner). Zoe Saldana is great as Uhura, John Cho is awesome as Sulu, Karl Urban was hilarious as Leonard 'Bones' McCoy and Simon Pegg was very memorable as Montgomery Scott (despite the least amount of screen time). The cast works very well together due to a brilliant script and amazing direction. <br/><br/>The story itself is well written. I particularly like the movie because it allows the writers and director to take the Enterprise crew on new directions in later installments of this new franchise. Star Trek has always forced us to believe in fantasy and this new Star Trek is exactly that - fantastic.<br/><br/>The camera work in the movie is stunning. There is a breathtaking moment the first time the camera zooms on the Enterprise NCC-1701 on the hull of the ship. The space scenes are breathtaking in both their scope and visuals. I will admit that the use of lens flares is a bit overdone, but I was able to ignore it as there is a lot of other stuff to be focusing on anyway.<br/><br/>The movie is just over 2 hours long and after it was over I was disappointed simply because I could have watched 2 hours more. Abrams has created a new fantastic universe to enjoy. With the infusion of new cast and direction, I personally cannot wait until the next installment comes out in a few years (I'm guessing).<br/><br/>As Spock states in the movie, ""Thrusters full ahead.""<br/><br/>Amazing movie.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"jordan-79","9","2","9","10 May 2009"," Great, but a few flaws
","Generally, this was great. There were a few flaws, though. The time paradox thing at the end with you-know-who could have been handled more adroitly. The bad guy could have been badder. The plot got a bit loopy in the middle and was a touch hard to follow. Kirk could have gotten beaten up just a little bit less, and I thought Checkov was just a bit too over-the-top (or under the English). Also, Sarek could have been more powerfully handled.<br/><br/>Plus, just how big is this Enterprise? It seems way of scale compared to what I would have ever thought it was. Yes, it might make more sense that this should have *always* been the scale, but since it wasn't way back when, I'm having a hard time adjusting.<br/><br/>As for the new and unexpected love interest...surprised me, but what the heck.<br/><br/>But having said this, what a great time, a great ride, and great casting (although Winona Ryder was kind of wasted here).<br/><br/>Yay! Can't wait to see the next three or four!"
"erikgloor","7","2","9","10 May 2009"," Great effects, good casting and a plot that didn't suck
","Visually dazzling.<br/><br/>Frenetically paced.<br/><br/>And amazingly, the plot did not suck.<br/><br/>These may be among the thoughts you'll be having after watching this sea-change in the Star Trek franchise from Bad Robot and Paramount.<br/><br/>As a fan of the original TV series, I was deeply concerned about how this universe and its characters would be handled by the studio, writers and director that brought us such turds as 'Cloverfield,' 'Transformers,' and 'Felicity.' 'Star Trek' is supposed to be the thinking-man's sci-fi. Oh sure, there's always the occasional bug-eyed monster, but the conflicts typically depicted in the TV show were of ideology, history, or conceptual science. In episode after episode, Kirk and his crew began their next adventure by having all their fancy weapons rendered useless by some overwhelmingly powerful set of circumstances and would invariably end up having to conceptualize their way out of a jam. That show's creators knew it was the human capacity for understanding that was the key to our future. Technical understanding, yes. But ethical and spiritual understanding, too.<br/><br/>So when I saw trailers for this supposed prequel with spectacular effects, collisions, and a young Kirk reinvented as Dennis the Menace, I was dubious to say the least.<br/><br/>And right away, my worst fears seemed confirmed. Ignoring any sense of pacing and story, we're dropped right away into the middle of some slam-bam action sequence jammed with quick-cut edits of people screaming, sparks flying, space-ships flopping around and big puffy explosions. In another opening sequence, a raffish, perhaps eleven-year-old James T. Kirk steals his step-dad's 20th century car and proceeds to drive it off a cliff – right after leaping out of it. Then a perhaps 20-something Kirk boozes his way into a bar fight over a girl and gets his clock cleaned.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>My Captain James T. Kirk was a daredevil only in his spare time. Always an ambitious climber, tactician, and scholar first. A 23rd century cold warrior who knew how to take orders as well as bend them. Oh sure, he might have raised a little hell at the academy now and again, but always more a grade-grabber than ass-grabber.<br/><br/>How did this film win me over? Everything it does right it does really right: Jaw-droppingly realistic effects sequences, smart casting, crisp acting and just the right tone for all the inside jokes and homages.<br/><br/>When our heroes are forced to parachute onto a titanic space-drill dangling in the stratosphere over the planet Vulcan, it's about as realistic and eye-popping a sci-fi scene as a movie-goer could hope for.<br/><br/>In case you missed the trailers, we meet all the original characters from the TV show as their careers begin aboard the USS Enterprise. Obviously, they could not have been played by the now greatly aged cast from the old TV show. A circumstance bound to breed hesitancy, especially among fans. But not only do we buy the new actors assigned to these old roles due to some uncanny physical resemblances, but we embrace them utterly the second they evince the slightest familiar affectation of each beloved role. When Karl Urban's updated Dr. McCoy winces and mutters ""You pointy-eared hop-goblin,"" after a frustrating exchange with Spock, you buy it hook, line and sinker. We catch only whiffs of Bill Shatner's Kirk from the largely untested Chris Pine. But who really could adequately fill William Shatner's shoes? The real star of this film is Zachary Quinto's Spock. His performance never misses a note in capturing that character's inner demons and new challenges.<br/><br/>Where does this updated 'Star Trek' go wrong? First: pacing. Apparently it would kill the makers of this film to give us a breather or moment's rest from or reflection on the endless action sequences that crowd up this film like rowdy teenagers at a frat party. Give us a break already. Establish a scene. Set a tone. Gimme a chance to re-fill my Coke.<br/><br/>Second: Violence. Not just violent scenes, but the violence done to the vision of the Star Trek universe. In the 1960's, Gene Roddenberry envisioned a more evolved human race that had more fully embraced the virtues of calm reason, personal dignity, and unwavering good will. This film's fleet cadets routinely swear, misbehave, and otherwise act coarsely or callously. It's a little disheartening and I preferred it when we had Roddenberry's future to aspire to.<br/><br/>Third: theme. With the exception of 'The Voyage Home,' it seems like every Star Trek movie since 'Wrath of Khan' has involved some personal vendetta between a Starfleet commander and some ticked-off alien. Sadly, the present film is no exception. I understand Hollywood probably thinks it's risky to bet box-office returns on the intelligence of the average American movie-goer, but it can't be any worse than churning out the same silly vendetta story over and over. I'd prefer they challenge themselves to challenge us all with a fresh story more reminiscent of the old TV show.<br/><br/>What ultimately saves this film from its otherwise equal balance sheet of pros and cons? A little thing called story. Beneath all the glammed-up effects and winking Hollywood smart-assery, is an actual story about actual feelings involving conceptual science. And this (air-quotes) ""story"" actually manages to explain everything from Kirk's new raffishness to Spock's new humanity. It respectfully, almost reverently ties this new franchise to the old and we are left feeling eager for the next installment.<br/><br/>If this franchise's writers and directors can stay focused on the Star Trek tradition of stories that make its audiences think a little, it will hopefully live long and prosper.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"
"omahonyjason","6","2","9","10 May 2009"," Definitely worth the trek, this movie will make stars of its brilliant young cast!
","Star Trek Director: J.J. Abrams Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 126 Minutes Rating: 15A<br/><br/>I remember the first time I saw automatic sliding doors, doors that opened when you walked towards them. It was in the new Quinnsworth in Tralee, in the mid 1980's, I was about 10 years old and I thought they were amazing!<br/><br/>The only place I had ever seen sliding doors before was on Star Trek, which by the mid 1980's was a decidedly nerdy and old, television show. Fans of the TV series, and there are countless millions of them out there, hold this up as proof of the brilliance of the show and of the show's creator, Gene Rodenberry. They also say that Rodenberry's wireless communications on board the Star Ship Enterprise gave Marty Cooper, a young Star Trek fan that grew up to become a chief engineer at Motorola, the impetus to invent the first ever mobile phone, a claim that Cooper upheld in a recent documentary.<br/><br/>When Star Trek first appeared on television way back in 1966, many people doubted Rodenberry's genius. In fact the series wasn't that terribly successful and was cancelled after just three years in 1969. Despite this, in 1976 fans of the series started a letter writing campaign and NASA's original Space Shuttle was named 'Enterprise' after the ship on Star Trek, while scientists from Steven Hawking to Bill Gates are fans.<br/><br/>So there's no real doubting the passion and brilliance of the fans. There have been a further 5 series and 10 movies and almost too many books and comics to mention but I, for one, have never been a Trekkie, so it was with some trepidation that I ventured to see the latest Star Trek offering from J.J. Abrams, creator of LOST. <br/><br/>Abrams boldly goes where no man has gone before, creating a story which explains the genesis of the original crew – so Kirk, Spock, Scotty and all the rest are back, but as we've never seen them before. The film tells the incredible story of the young crew's maiden voyage on board the most advanced starship ever created: the U.S.S. Enterprise. On a journey filled with action, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits have to find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind.<br/><br/>There's a little twist in that the fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of Kirk and Spock who are bitter rivals in this movie. James T. Kirk is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy while Spock was raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. They're Yin and Yang but as fiery instinct clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger.<br/><br/>So does it work? I think it does – brilliantly! JJ Abrams has created something as amazing as sliding doors! He honours the original creation while fashioning a film that the movie going masses will also embrace and in the process creates a movie for hard core fans and the general public alike. It's a movie for anyone that likes movies!"
"pressboard","8","2","9","10 May 2009"," Amazing - A Good Star Trek Movie
","For me, the Star Trek movie series ended after ""Wrath Of Khan"". That was the last movie that resembled the original Star Trek series in feel and look. The other Star Trek movies did not even qualify as entertaining as stand alone movies, much less as part of a franchise. Zoe Saldana did not even come close to Nichelle Nichols as Uhura. She did not have the same sultry presence or any presence at all and her passion for Spock just seemed to be there because it was in the script. Simon Pegg, whom I like for his other movies, was a poor Scotty and was probably cast because he has such a huge following. He did a poor Scottish accent to boot. Zachary Quinto, for me, took some getting used to as the young Spock. He worked as a substandard look-alike (too soft), but lacked the intensity and intelligence that Leonard Nimoy brings to the role even at 78 years old. I constantly had to remind myself that this guy was supposed to be Spock. Chris Pine nails the young Kirk and was better (sorry Bill) than William Shatner was in fulfilling the original Tiberius. All accolades go to Karl Urban, however, for his portrayal of the younger Doctor McCoy, Dead-On and as funny as hell. Anton Yelchin was an over-the-top and heavily accented Pavel Chekov who really kick-started my imagining of these separate people as a team and crew. His very heavy accent and quizzical looks make him one of the strongest characters (behind Bones). While Eric Bana as Nero is no Khan, he is menacing enough in his mining ship - (if this is what the mining ships of the future look like I would hate to see what the fully armed battleships look like (shudder))- to give the older Spock and his counterpart crew a run for their money while creating a tense atmosphere.<br/><br/>Despite my above criticism I thought this movie was great and recommend it highly. I am amazed that after so many flops they finally got it right! Enjoy."
"sedativchunk","7","2","9","9 May 2009"," Star Trek 09 - A Great Movie That Revisits the Classic TV Show Theme
","First off, I would like to say that I am a young but big fan of the original series and movies. I love the entire original cast and anything else just feels wrong to me. I've been very skeptical about this movie but because of all the hype, I decided to go ahead and see it. Amongst this, I wanted to give it a fair shot and not be biased against the new and young actors portraying the original cast. Well I have to say this movie delivers! I actually enjoyed it more than a few of the original six Star Trek films (not everyone of those movies was great if you seen them). One thing that's significantly been improved was the CGI which has sadly always been a burden for the original Star Trek movies. I thought special effect's were going to ruin this film though, by being over dowsed with it. But they don't! The classic negotiating and conversation that the original series had still exist in this movie.<br/><br/>Another thing I really loved in this movie was the sound. Being a hobbyist music and sound producer, I think sound and music is a biggie when it comes to movies. The movie uses all the classic sounds from the original series and it throws in the classic, addicting TV show theme in at the end of the movie. Not only this, but visually, the uniforms, the Enterprise, everything was very accurate with the original series. This I like!<br/><br/>Now to get on to some of the downsides. The biggest one... this movie was missing the original Captain Kirk! I don't care who you are, if you don't support the fact that William Shatner should have been in this movie, then you are not a true trekkie. I would have gladly rated this movie a 10/10 if Shatner was in it, but beings he was missing from the story, I cannot give it a perfect score. On the other hand, it was very nice to see Leonard Nimoy back one more time and hear his words of wisdom, but he is the only one of the original cast we get to see, although the storyline may have not made sense to throw in anyone else. Another thing that bothers me is the beginning of the movie with Kirk and Spock growing up. I felt that this area of the movie could have used improvements, especially with the very lame car chase scene. In the Star Trek universe, there is no law enforcement. And what's with the old car? This was a part of the movie that made little sense.<br/><br/>I was overall happy with this movie but I will never forget the original cast who made the franchise so huge and I will continue to watch the original series. The movie is missing the 60's vibe and feel and it still feels wrong with so many of the original cast members missing. The portrayal of the original cast is almost dead on, especially with Checkov (his voice is a perfect match for the original). Zachary Qunito as Spock was excellent and Chris Pine played a perfect, egotistic Captain Kirk without trying to imitate Shatner. I recommend this movie to all Star Trek fans, young and old. It's still better than Next Generations if you are not a fan of Captain Picard and I think the movie should be given a fair chance. It's a nice flick and I just hope that it doesn't get thrown in the trash like the Lost In Space movie remake did!"
"robocoaster","9","2","9","9 May 2009"," This is not existing Star Trek canon, but...
","...This is Star Trek nonetheless, and it's freaking good! Any talk about the failure to adhere to established conventions in the Star Trek universe are form closed-minded fans who want something to gripe about. There are only a small number of these type of nit- pickers fortunately. The overall collective ""yawn"" the arrival of ""Nemesis"" was greeted with, proved there had to be serious discussions about moving Trek forward if any type of movies were going to be made, anyway.<br/><br/>All of the previous series and movies aren't being locked up; they will continue onward and actually prosper. This movie will be the impetus for a whole lot of new folk checking out Trek, some of whom, but not all, will become new converts of any number of Trek incarnations.<br/><br/>This is a good thing.<br/><br/>I too miss the thought-provoking philosophical musings of older Trek. And who knows, I imagine some of that will gain a presence in future installments. If it doesn't, oh well. Besides, it's not like the movie doesn't resonate; it has a very definite beating heart in the relationship that is at the core. It also has a strong message about being true to oneself. Also, none of the cast was bordering on parody, anything but. Some people are so set in their ways they don't know homage when they see it. And the timeline plot device works just fine.<br/><br/>I like the music and I'm glad it didn't scream ""Star Trek score"", and beyond some contrivances (hint: some were most definitely a call out to Trek cheese), I appreciated the writing. I could care less about the admittedly stunning effects, and was surprised how much I laughed, which was a good deal! This is also the most thrilling space adventure in quite some time. The whiny nay-sayers need to adjust to necessary change, lest they suffer the same fate as Lieutenant Valeris and General Chang."
"agardk","8","2","9","9 May 2009"," Enjoyable SciFi but a bit distracting for Trek fans.
","To begin with, as a standalone SciFi action-adventure movie, it will be great fun. This probably even more true for non Trek fans who are not well versed Trek lore or the so-called ""Trek Universe."" The effects were outstanding and most of the leads did goods jobs bringing iconic characters back to life. Karl Urban did particularly well as bones.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is with the lack of continuity with the 40 plus years of Trek lore that preceded it. There are simply too many things that will have Trek fans going ""huh?"" Abrams and the writers seem to be trying to explain these away with an alternative time line but it just doesn't work. There are too many to ignore or dismiss. even in that context of an alternate time line many of the more glaring continuity issues don't make sense.<br/><br/>I'm not one of those Trek zealots or purists, nor do I generally sit there while watching a movie looking for gaffs. In fact, my usual response to such criticisms is, ""It's a movie, get over it."" However, in this case if you mess with the continuity as often as they did in this movie it becomes a distraction to the viewer, as it did for me in this case. Which is why I gave it an 8 instead of a 9 or 10.<br/><br/>The continuity issue aside, I recommend that anyone who enjoys SciFi or just a good action filled flick go see this on the big screen. It's worth the 11 bucks."
"DKosty123","9","2","9","9 May 2009"," Where No One Has Gone Before, Into The Future
","Granted traditional Trekkies from the 1960's will not like this film. Then again, these same people are the same people who think that Iraq and Vietnam are the same war. They have their heads buried in the sand and ignore the potential of change and how it can benefit the future of a great franchise.<br/><br/>This film has more action than many previous Treks. This film does not go out of Treks way to tie with the older films and TV series. Instead it is something fresh, bold, and enjoyable. In some ways it is a breath of fresh air blown into an old franchise.<br/><br/>While the film is not perfect, it is written with both the old series fans and the new young fans in mind. Leonard Nimoy is pretty long in the tooth, but he comes off well as an elderly Spock. This movie takes this foundation and uses it to promote change.<br/><br/>It is change that the original series was about. The old franchise hit it's low point with Robert Wises pondering Star Trak The Movie. Thank goodness this is much better than that. For those who give this a chance, they will find some irony with the story. There are not a lot of holes in this one and the writing is pretty clever for the most part.<br/><br/>To me the biggest hole in the plot is the drilling sequence on Vulcan. It is done more for visual & special effects as it would be easy to change this scene from how it is written. Other than this sequence the rest makes sense. The plotting is good and the acting is good. The young cast makes the characters their own.<br/><br/>If there is a problem, it is how do you follow this movie? What is the next step. This one ends with a real dedication to Gene Roddenbury. This film shows how flexible this franchise can be, in case the past films and series haven't already. This is an exciting warp drive ride."
"Apemangalore","9","2","9","9 May 2009"," An instant sci-fi classic
","First of all, I've never been that much of a Star Trek fan. Throughout the years, I've only watched a hand full of episodes, and it wasn't until rather recently when I decided to watch Wrath of Khan, which not only thoroughly impressed me, but got me even more excited for this latest installment. Now, while it may be too early to say for certain (as I've only just come back from seeing the movie), I'm tempted to call Star Trek one of my all-time favorite science fiction films.<br/><br/>On top of this being one of the best looking movies I've seen in a long time, I was very pleasantly surprised by the action in this film. Ships aren't simply staring at each other, waiting for somebody to fire the next shot. Here, they're swooping past each other, and diving under chunks of ship debris; it's just a ton of fun to watch. Also, the fight choreography is top-notch, and - in some ways - more engaging than any of the ship battles in the movie. If anything, I felt that there was almost too much action in the film. Not a huge gripe, but there were a few action sequences that felt irrelevant to the story. Overall, the action, as well as the special effects, are superb.<br/><br/>The most impressive part of the movie, however, is the acting. Even as somebody who hasn't watched a whole lot of the original TV series, I felt that each of the actors nailed their respective characters perfectly. Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as Dr. Bones McCoy were especially brilliant, from their mannerisms and nuances, to just the overall essence of their characters. The only character whose motivations I wasn't able to buy was Nero, despite being very well portrayed by Eric Bana.<br/><br/>Overall, Star Trek is a smart, funny, action-packed thrill ride. Whether you're a die-hard Star Trek fan or somebody who has never even heard of the series up until now, you'll have an absolute blast. This is not only my second favorite film of the year so far (with Coraline still sitting firmly at the #1 spot), but one of the finest science fiction movies I've ever seen."
"sgone30","9","2","9","9 May 2009"," JJ Abrams does the business
","An incredible film that quite literally takes your breath away, right from the start, with an epic space battle with villain Eric Bana to the epic space battle at the end, yes you guessed it with Mr Bana again. In between there are some familiar character moments between McCoy Kirk, and Spock. It was almost like watching Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley interacting as they used to in the original series and films. The character portrayals of such iconic figures were pulled off impeccably by Pine, Quinto, and Urban and thoroughly entertaining. A special mention should go to Anton Yelchin who portrays Pavol Checkov brilliantly. I honestly thought I was watching Walter Koenig. He also has his own ""Nuclear Wessels"" moment in the Film. Also great supporting performances from the ever solid Bruce Greenwood, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, and John Cho. One little gripe, Eric Bana could have been given more screen time to give the audience more of a feel to how menacing his character was and to better utilise an actor who is one of the best.<br/><br/>Abrams has produced a film that has a lot of familiarity for the existing Trek fans but also feels very different at the same time. In a nutshell, a totally different experience to what has gone before in Star Trek. The film was visually stunning with a very surprising plot and an excellent cast.<br/><br/>I personally thought that the Trek universe had come to an end but this film has breathed new life into it and can now go off in many directions. Partly because the plot events of this film have basically re-written the time-line right from the original series up to and beyond the Voyager TV series (over 100 years in the ST universe) ie. those events now never occurred.<br/><br/>But in the main, because of the brilliance of JJ Abrams! A film well worth seeing and should be the hit of 2009. <br/><br/>One final note, it was great to see Leonard Nimoy back in the Star Trek Universe."

","This was a good take on the development of the characters in the original show. As a fan of the original series, I always found the Star Trek movies with the original cast to be disappointing. It almost seemed like they were just going through the motions to make the Star Trek movies (with the notable exception of ""The Wrath of Khan"").<br/><br/>Though a couple of the Star Trek TV series' that came later were good, they always fell short of expectations. TNG was the best, all the others that followed was either bad, or worse.<br/><br/>This movie, however, has kept the characters to what you had always hoped they were, and made them even better, all the while keeping the plot going with a lot of action. It even added a few ideas that put a new light on watching reruns of the original series. On this, I will just say that Kirk really was as sexually prolific as was thought and that Spock has a little more than just logic in his head."

","I've never been a Star Trek fan, but you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie and I am very sure that was the exact intention of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>To be honest, my expectations weren't that high, apart from Wrath of Khan and First Contact, I did not like the previous Star Trek films, they were slow and sometimes unintentionally comic (and this will surely anger some ST fans, but I believe Star Trek in general is not quite as intellectual as they want it to be).<br/><br/>Now to this new Star Trek films, the Pros: - the story: it was very entertaining though I was somewhat confused sometimes and I've foundthe characters' promotions a bit quick (of course, you kinda have toform the new crew of Enterprise in the first movie). I especially likedthe character introductions, McCoy and Sulu got the best ones.<br/><br/><ul><li>the actors: the cast was energetic and young, the guy who played Spock was especially good (I didn't expect him to be after seeing the trailers), but the highlight was Kirk, Scotty and that older captain of the Enterprise, whose name I can't recall. oh and McCoy was a blast (""Are you out of your Vulcan mind?!""). Uhura I didn't like, not the portrayal, but the character herself as she was written.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the music: I really liked the new theme, but apart from that, you didn't really notice it as much you'd take notice of the score in a Star Wars movie - visuals: this film look spectacular! best SFX I've seen since Star Wars III and Transformers (yeah, I don't watch a lot of movies:)) </li></ul><br/><br/>The Cons: - the flares: I've found those flares bloody irritating And that's about it. I am eagerly anticipating the announced sequel. I hope they keep all the actors and conjure up a great new story.<br/><br/>To the studio: this new Star Trek film had a soul, a warmth to it that I've been missing in the new Star Wars films (though I kinda liked them in their own way). Keep this soul and you'll get my money in round two (and the DVDs).<br/><br/>Oh and make a better poster for Star Trek XII please!"
"Sebastian1966","9","2","9","9 May 2009"," A gutsy, brave and ultimately exciting new Trek boldly goes into the 21st century!
","Right off the top, there will be MANY who will be angry with the JJ Abrams' new take on Star Trek; and that is understandable, to some extent. This is a Star Trek with a brave, new ""take no prisoners"" attitude. It is very kinetic and more 'space opera' than earlier entries, and it has some very hard consequences (no reset buttons here, folks; this version of Trek's timeline is indeed changed). But I found it to be precisely what the stagnant franchise needed: An injection of fresh blood! The plot is rather simple; a wronged Romulan mining captain Nero (Eric Bana, playing a nice sketch rather than a full character) from the 24th century is thrown back in time to the 23rd, and seeks revenge on Spock and the Federation for their perceived role (from his POV) in the destruction of his homeworld. And like a bull in a china shop, his actions rewrite much of the 23rd century's 'history'; resulting in this movie's exciting new playground...an alternate version of the classic, 1960s 23rd century Trek brought up-to-date for the 21st century. To lend the new production a sense of legitimacy, Leonard Nimoy's ""Spock Prime"" is also thrown back in time as a sort of a 'passing of the baton' to this familiar, but new crew.<br/><br/>The film takes many potentially alienating chances with the franchise (such as with the destruction of two major Trek planets and a recurring character). But these moves were made courageously; without a finger poised over the infamous Trek 'reset button.' A very bold move. And to this old Trekkie (hate the name Trekker; too pretentious), it paid off handsomely. And this is perhaps the best-looking Trek movie EVER. The budget is all up on screen. The old/revised Enterprise looks absolutely gorgeous; her best incarnation since the first movie. The bridge is bright, and a bit 'i-pod' looking; but it grows on you. I had a nit with the engine room, though (looks like a brewery, guys; sorry! And steam turbines?? The ship is NOT atomic-powered, and even today's nuclear reactors would look more modern, frankly). It doesn't fit the high-tech, but gritty look of the rest of the ship. Didn't care for Nero's mining ship/weapon, either. Looked very impractical, and way too much like the enemy ship in the last film, 2002's dreadful ""Nemesis"" (a film I'd rather forget, thank you). Visually, the mining ship lacked a cohesive shape; like a giant, space-borne porcupine. But otherwise, everything in this incarnation of Trek is very pleasing to behold; and it was a also great to see MANY homages and references to the old series (Scotty has a pet tribble on Delta Vega, and poor Captain Pike STILL winds up in a wheelchair, though not crippled and mutilated this time....yet!).<br/><br/>But to me, the ONE element that really made it all work for me was the CHARACTERS! And kudos to the new cast, esp Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban as Kirk, Spock and McCoy, respectively. They did NOT settle for cheap imitations; they really 'channeled' these guys and there were many moments where it felt like the classic series characters were reborn with fresh energy and no limits! The supporting characters did fairly well with their interpretations, though I felt that Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin as Scotty and Chekov were often played for broad laughs, often at the expense of characterization. But, then again, this often happened in the classic series as well, I reminded myself. It's a reboot of 1960s Star Trek, not Shakespeare. So, I decided to go with the ride and have fun with it. Besides, Chris Pine's Kirk and Karl Urban's McCoy were phenomenal; far exceeding my expectations. Quinto plays a Spock not yet in control of his emotions, and it is a nice (and interesting) nuance he adds to the character. Contrasts well with Nimoy's 'at peace' Spock character from the 'future'.<br/><br/>And that's what really made this whole new, blazing Star Trek roller-coaster so much fun for me; the central characters really leaped off of the screen. And now that they are allowed to exist again in this 'alternate timeline' with great new actors interpreting them, they can BOLDLY GO into this new 21st century take on old Star Trek. I can't wait to see where they go with this re-booted franchise. Hope it lives long and prospers!"

It does a brilliant job of revealing how the characters we know so well got to be who they are. Special effects are beyond words. These days I see many CGI artists so taken over by the technology that they forget to tell a story. This movie has a great balance of technical wizadry used just in the right amounts to move the story forward.<br/><br/>All actors just do a great job - the young Kirk & Spock are outstanding. The time shifting bit with 2 spocks was a bit jarring to my ""logical"" mind, but who cares? fantastic fun for 2 hours - go see it!"
"filrite","8","2","9","8 May 2009"," Star Trek times a Trillion!!!...lens flares that is :-(
","I had my doubts about going to see Star Trek. I've been a fan of Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space 9 to a lesser amount, Voyager had its moments and Enterprise was just getting good when they cancelled it. The thing with the original series in the UK, they always played the ""Miri "" every time I happened to come across it. Never the less all the characters and stories seeped into my sub conscience and became part of our cultural DNA. With the preconception that this would be another unresolved story line with a thousand plot holes, like every other JJ Adrams venture...Lost...Cloverfield and Mission Impossible III. I was dreading what crucial plot device would never be explained in this re- imagining of Star Trek for the 21st Century. How wrong I was! I was amazed to find myself screaming at the screen with delight as another ""In joke"" was suggested or casually thrown in. Gripping my arm rests as another amazing space battle was revealed in a new and exciting way. Every story and sub-plot was satisfactorily rounded off. George Lucas could learn a thing or two from JJ about how to tell an exciting story when the audience that already knows the outcome. A few twists and re- tellings of old episodes may cause some hard core fans to object, but the level of imagination and care and above all ...love put into this movie deserves more than one viewing. However most of that love and attention to detail with be forever lost to the fans who want to love this movie as much as they should. Why? I hear you say...because of Daniel Minel. Daniel Mindel, the cinematographer and his lighting crew who shone lights into every composition, every beautiful ship, stunt and cast member. Lens flare is not what people want to see when they go to see a movie! For decades Directors of Photography have come up with ingenious ways to counter light refracting in the elements of a lens. One would think by the 23rd Century it would not be a problem for bridge crew to have to work with a pair of welding goggles! Otherwise good job JJ, I look forward to the inevitable sequels...or prequels."
"scott-sw","7","2","9","8 May 2009"," Great time at the movies
","Face it, the Star Trek franchise needed this, badly. The new Star Trek movie is fabulous, and will definitely find new fans and give the Enterprise a good shot of adrenaline. I know a lot of classic Trekkers (I always preferred that name) are crying blaspheme since it did not follow the true ""canonical"" history of the series and the original movies, but purists like that are not realists. Yes, Kirk's parents were murdered by an evil despot, he has a brother named Sam, and was originally on the Farragaut, not the Enterprise--at least that is the purist view. I can understand changes to the source material, but not in the show and movie's commitment to science. First, the warp drive works too well, making planets that were days or a couple weeks away now just a couple of hours. The other sin was Scotty's ability to beam something from one end of the galaxy to the next, even if one of those objects is at warp speed. Finally, one plot point of how Spock removes Kirk from the ship is ridiculously idiotic. However, the film has much more in the positive column. In this rebooted version by J.J. Abrams, Kirk's dad dies in the line of duty, allowing his pregnant wife to escape and give birth to James Tiberius Kirk. He is true to the maverick form portrayed in the original series, although he does not enunciate and hesitate in his painful over-acting. McCoy is also true to form as a cranky, old-fashioned doctor who is leery of new technology, especially transportation. My favorite (as it has always been) is the reboot of Scotty. Yes, he's still Scottish, he's still an engineering genius, but he's a lot more comical. Spock (Zachary Quinto), though, is taken in a different light. He must learn to follow his emotions and look to them. And we get all the phrases used: ""I'm given her all I got, Captain,"" ""I'm a doctor, not a physicist,"" ""Fascinating."" We get Captain Christopher Pike, Sarek, the Khobayashi Maru, and Romulans. The plot is that a Romulan Commander, Captain Nero (Eric Bana), travels back through time to exact revenge on the Federation. You see, the Spock we all know and love (Leonard Nimoy) was trying to prevent the Romulan sun from going supernova. However, he is too late, so Nero vows revenge and travels back in time to punish both Vulcan and Earth. This leads the Enterprise, commanded by Pike, to appoint Spock as acting captain and Kirk as the first officer. There are so many things that go so well with this movie. First, it is laced with action scenes blended with fantastic CGI effects the old television series could never duplicate. We also get the first taste of actually using the up and down mode with space as opposed to forward, reverse, and side to side. The audience is also treated to a more conflicted Spock. There is also a strong tension between Kirk and his Vulcan ally. There is a little romance, and some kick-ass space battles. There is also room for sequels (of course). Reading some earlier reviews, I recall seeing one calling this Star Trek the best prequel ever made. I agree. I can't wait for what's next."
"headfulofghosts126","9","2","9","8 May 2009"," Perfect? No. Necessary? Absolutely.
","A lot of Trek fans will be quick to dismiss the alternate time line of this film and the more action oriented approach to a franchise typically more cerebral. And I understand those grievances. It would be tough to feel so connected to forty years worth of material only to have someone who isn't a fan come along and shake it all up. I grew up with TNG. The original cast still had movies coming out in the theaters when I was a kid. I've seen all the movies and every episode of TOS and TNG. I still loved this new Star Trek. And I didn't think I would.<br/><br/>It's been ages since a Trek film had this many scenes that left an emotional impact on me. The pre-credits sequence is one of the best moments in the entire history of this mythology. And the film that follows hits so much more often than it misses.<br/><br/>I had such mixed feelings about re-casting these iconic roles but wow... some of these guys blew me away. For me the stand outs were Chris Pine as Kirk (who has that trademark swagger down to a T but NEVER feels like he's doing a Shatner impression) and Karl Urban as McCoy (who was my favorite part of the film, he just completely embodied the character). Zachary Quinto is more that serviceable as Spock and the only detriment to his performance is putting Leonard Nimoy in the same movie as him. There's just no comparison.<br/><br/>Yes the plot is filled with some major contrivances and conveniences (it's a mad dash to get the crew acquainted & Kirk promoted) but the momentum it builds and the energy is exhumes make it hard not to forgive most of them.<br/><br/>For me the biggest let down was the villain, Nero. I read reviews that talked about a layered performance and I just didn't get that. He seemed to be cut from the same mold as most forgettable Trek villains with a pretty rudimentary back story to boot. He's certainly no Khan or Chang. I think Eric Bana is a wonderful actor, the script just never lets the character become anything more than a plot device. I've heard there's a prequel comic that details his origin a bit better but that shouldn't be required reading to get the most out of the movie. It was the only part of an otherwise exciting film that just fell totally flat. At least for me. I found myself bored every time they cut back to him.<br/><br/>Sure I miss the more philosophical and moral questions the best Trek stories touched on. But I think there's still room for that. The foundation has been laid. The set-up's been taken care of. Now there's an infinite number of possibilities for the Enterprise and her crew. I remain optimistic that future installments will have a mix of the best elements from both takes. I love that they widened the scope and amped up the action. I love that it finally felt dangerous and everything had very tangible consequences. I think that was an important first step. If this cast and these filmmakers are afforded the opportunity to continue I truly believe strong thematic elements will rival the visual ones. And hey, they're already off to a much better start than the original cast was with their first movie.<br/><br/>I'll always have a soft spot for Shatner, Nimoy, Kelly, etc. But I love that it's all still canon. No one said to ignore all of that. This isn't a remake. It's a new series that runs parallel to the Trek we all grew up with. And honestly, I'd take this over what Trek became over the last decade.<br/><br/>It needed a good shake. It's not a perfect movie. But a necessary one. I left the theater today with a smile on my face and the knowledge that Star Trek would live on. The same could not be said just a few years ago."
"randymiles-63309","4","1","3","4 November 2018"," Only watch if you are a Trekkie.
","Star Trek is an unnecessary reboot in my opinion. JJ Abrabs is a talented filmmaker and it is easy to see his enthusiasm (he is almost like a fanboy giddily recreating all his favorite childhood movies) and rigor but the reboot and especially the cast will always suffer from comparison with the original TV series. Furthermore, although the film is interesting and gets everything sorted- in as much as one can in less than 2 hours- there is a rushed feeling to the proceedings. The special effects are good but we've seen it all by now, the razzle and dazzle only goes so far. The Star trek reboot isn't a bad film as much as an unneeded one."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","3","25 July 2017"," 'Star Trek': The Prequel
","While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock.<br/><br/>The films based on the original series were a mixed bag. A few great ones with 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Voyage Home' and 'The Undiscovered Country', one in-between film with 'The Search for Spock' and disappointments with 'The Motion Picture' and particularly 'The Final Frontier'. There were ten 'Star Trek' films before this 2009 reboot, four being based on the 'Next Generation series where the only outstanding one was 'First Contact'. 'Generations to me was another in-between film and 'Insurrection' and 'Nemesis' were two other particularly problematic ones.<br/><br/>'Star Trek' (2009) is neither one of the best of the films or one of the worst, if anything it's another in-between effort while being marginally better than the other two in-between films. There are a lot of impressive elements and some major flaws that stop it from being the great prequel that it had potential to be.<br/><br/>Visually, the film mostly looks great. Particularly good is the set for the Enterprise which not only amazes visually but one of the elements that sticks close to the original series. The special effects are mainly fantastic and leave one in awe, while there is audacious and suitably moody cinematography and atmospheric lighting. By all means it is not perfect visually, there is the distracting overuse of lens flares that was in serious need of a toning down, it was a technique that was abused somewhat, didn't feel necessary in some scenes and is not particularly comfortable sometimes to look at.<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino delivers another winner of a music score, don't remember ever being disappointed by this man. Sure it is familiar, but it fits very well with the film and its mood and is unmistakable Giacchino, a beautiful score to listen to and has a lot of atmosphere.<br/><br/>There are some thought-provoking moments in the script and it doesn't feel too talky which is true in spirit to the original series. Where it doesn't fare so well is the comic relief, there is a little too much of it and some of it wasn't particularly funny and seemed superfluous as well.<br/><br/>Regarding the story, 'Star Trek' (2009) evoked mixed reactions from me. It is rich in atmosphere and has some thrilling moments and truly exciting action, while the interplay between Kirk and Spock is brilliantly written and makes one feel quite nostalgic. Most of it is easy to follow. Less good are some bogus science, some parts that are convoluted and could have benefited from more explanation and Nero's plan and motivation being underdeveloped, confused and inconsistent. It is also too big and noisy in spectacle and could have quietened down to give room for more characterisation. One of the original series' strengths too was the characters and how they were developed and interacted, other than Kirk, McCoy and Spock there wasn't enough of that with most of them like Nero being far too one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Casting is mostly good but with a couple of misses. Zachary Quinto in particular nails it as Spock with huge shoes to fill, capturing perfectly what was so iconic about the character in the first place. Another great contribution is a suitably cantankerous Karl Urban, who remains loyal to DeForrest Kelley's interpretation without being an impersonation. Chris Pine did very well and is certainly more subtle than William Shatner, the character isn't likable at first but evolves and Pine brings that out. Zoe Saldana is fiery and sexy and Bruce Greenwood is good fun. It was nice to see Nimoy again as Old Spock and brought a nostalgic and affectionate element. Bana has some menace and does his best, but there are admittedly far more interesting villains in other 'Star Trek' films.<br/><br/>Not everybody works. Simon Pegg, who is usually a very entertaining guy, is beyond irritating comic relief with Scotty coming over as a caricature. Anton Yelchin has also given much better performances, he badly overdoes it as Chekhov.<br/><br/>In conclusion, fun and impressive often but with some major flaws at the same time. Nothing comes over disastrously though. 6.5-7/10 Bethany Cox"

Recasting cinematic legends for characters that they mastered was really no easy task but they they absolutely nailed it with Chris Pine nailing it as Captain Kirk giving him a more flawed and relatable portrayal than that of William Shatner. Zachary Quinto absolutely blew me away in this film with his performance to the point were I was hoping for a best actor nomination for him which obviously did not happen but doesn't make his performance any less fantastic. The rest of the cast was also great Scotty and Bones both being the films comic relief I though they were both hilariously funny in this film while still having a good heart to there characters. The late Anton Yelchin also blew me away in this movie he nails that new kid quality to Chekov making you feel right at home with him playing the character. The special effects are incredible in this film they make you feel the scale and power of the enterprise and the scale of the destruction during the space battle action scenes. Eric Bana to me is a really underrated actor he absolutely blew me away with his amazing performance in Munich and kills it here as Nero he just gets his characters damaged persona while still managing to make for a sinister portrayal.

","I've always liked Star Trek. I wouldn't consider myself a Trekkie, but I would say that I have enjoyed watching the Star Trek universe thoroughly. I've seen almost every single movie and TV series in the franchise. Some were great, some OK, and some were just a very, very bad failure. It's been quite a roller coaster ride for Star Trek, but I think we are finally on the right Trek.<br/><br/>First let me just say: I LOVE THE CAST. Chris Pine (James T. Kirk), Zachary Quinto (Spock), Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Karl Urban (Leonard McCoy) and the rest of the wonderful cast made the movie. And to bring back Leonard Nimoy was a stroke of genius. The script was great, the jokes hilarious, the acting was phenomenal and we finally have a Star Trek movie with fantastic graphics!!!! (Although I think they went a little overboard on the haze lights.) <br/><br/>The person who decided to put Spock and Uhura together is a genius. Their relationship just works. I don't know why it wasn't thought of before. I just hope this relationship lasts and we end up seeing Spock and Uhura tying the knot in the fourth installment. (something Star Trek has almost never done.) Please please please keep them together!<br/><br/>Now onto what I do think needs a bit of work:<br/><br/>1: I do think the Romulans needed to look more like aliens and less like bald tattoo'd humans. I was never really scared of them either. They kind of just looked like a biker gang in space with a cool ship.<br/><br/>2:I'd like to have seen more aliens than humans, but, it didn't feel any less Star Trek without them. <br/><br/>3:They portrayed Kirk as a wimpy, selfish, womanizing jerk throughout. It got better as the film went on but he really only improved by the end of the next film Star Trek: Into Darkness. <br/><br/>4:Kirk progressed way too fast to captain and everything seems to step aside every time he loses the chair to let him regain it. (Both in this film and Star Trek: Into Darkness.)<br/><br/>5:The bar scene exchange between Kirk and Uhura was WAAAYYY too much. I cringe every time I see that scene. I would actually like it if they cut out that whole thing. The exchange isn't even necessary if only to show Kirk as a womanizing sleazebag. (It happens about ten minutes in and lasts about eight minutes.)<br/><br/>Well, that's my review. I hope this helps and that if you do watch the movie that you love it as much as I did. If you have never seen a Star Trek film before this film does not require you to have any previous Star Trek knowledge. And if you have seen them I hope you will enjoy! Once you have seen this movie go see Star Trek: Into Darkness where I am going to be posting a review on soon. I have yet to see Star Trek: Beyond but once I do I will surely post a review!<br/><br/>Have a marvelous day!"

","I've never really been a trekkie my whole life. Didn't grow up with the television series and haven't actively explored it later in life. When the announcement came that wonder-kid JJ Abrams would be taking on the lofty overhaul of a remake, I didn't freak out or anything. In fact I waited quite a while before seeing it in theatres, dragged along by a buddy who talked it up quite a bit. Well, it was amazing, and still is. Nothing gets you pumped and makes your heart ache quite as much as that epic ten prologue, starring an intrepid Chris Hemsworth who selflessly saves the lives of everyone onboard his ship, including his newborn son, James T. Kirk. When your eyes flood with tears in the first few minutes of a film, it's always a good sign. Abrams ushered in Star Trek for the new generation, and I imagine strived to keep core elements like friendship, camaraderie and wonder alive as well. Chris Pine makes one hell of a Kirk, but then he's one of the best in his age group these days. Cocky, belligerent, dysfunctional, impulsive and recklessly brave, he's the perfect opposing force to Zachary Quinto's calculated, logical, no nonsense Spock, who goes through quite a wringer when his entire world is decimated by rogue Romulan extremist Nero, played by a sensational Eric Bana. Both Kirk and Spock are no stranger to loss, being affected and reacting to it in different ways. Their initial rivalry tangles into the beginning of a friendship, hinted at by Leonard Nimoy's Spock Prime, visiting Quinto from far in the future (time travel, baby). The plot and character motivations are in fact mostly about loss and anger; Nero himself is driven by grief which has morphed into poisonous hatred, willing to inflict hurt a thousand fold in return for what happened to his people. Bana finds the wounded areas of Nero, and uses the trademark Romulun leer to cover them up in violent fury. There must always be comic relief too, and when the banter between the two heroes gets too dark, the spotlight shifts to chipper Scotty (Simon Pegg) and a brilliant Karl Urban as Leonard 'Bones' Mccoy, the ship's neurotic doctor. Urban is cast heavily against type in the liveliest role he's ever been thrown, and clearly loves every antsy second of it. John Cho makes a formidable Sulu, and the sadly departed Anton Yelchin charms the pants off of everyone with his priceless Russian accent. Clifton Collins Jr. and Jennifer Morrison are great as well. Abrams loves to cast beloved actors from bygone eras in these things (I peed a little when Peter Weller showed up in the sequel), so keep a look out for terrific work from Ben Cross and Winona Ryder as Spock's parents. Bruce Greenwood is nobility incarnate as Commander Pike, the kindly captain who sees the potential in Kirk and paternally attempts to clear the wreckage of his personality, dust it off and make something out of him. The special effects and set pieces are a dizzying dream of nonstop adrenaline. The opener I mentioned before, a show stopping fight scene atop a giant chain miles above the surface of a planet, the hair raising arrival of Nero's ship (it looks like some horrific giant space beetle) and a chase across a snowy tundra pursued by an evil Yeti Muppet thing are highlights that demonstrate how effective and useful CGI can be when implemented properly. For all its razzle dazzle though, Star Trek is ultimately about relationships between different beings (human or other), the ways in which they deal with tragedy, love one another, learn to coexist, help those in need and most importantly, explore the wonders of the universe around them. I admire the fact that in a huge Sci Fi blockbuster such as this, those kind of themes and qualities come first. We are all made of stars, and inward exploration of the ones that reside in us and how they make us what we are is just as essential as the world's that lie millions of light years away, awaiting our arrival. JJ understands this, and I offer him a well earned Starfleet salute for it."
"kmtwalsh","10","1","3","23 July 2016"," Star Trek back at its best
","When I first heard they were doing a remake of Star Trek, I was not excited as I worried whether this new film would capture all the elements that had made Star Trek a joy to watch but I have to say I was more than pleasantly relieved that all the creative forces behind it did a fantastic job of bringing it back to the big screen with the elements fans had loved from the series and films and added new components that gave a freshness to the series that it much needed.<br/><br/>The plot was very inventive, to change what fans know of the environment of Star Trek and the characters backgrounds. I will admit to not understanding the science behind the plot or should I say any of the science involved in Star Trek but what happens is a romulan space ship from the future comes through a black hole and changes the history that had been written before. It shapes the life's of Kirk and Spock in the same ways as they both grow up isolated but also acting out in their own ways. They meet at Starfleet Academy where Spock catches Kirk cheating on a test but before Kirk is disciplined, they are sent on a mission to answer a distress call from Vulcan. What continues throughout the film is Kirk and Spock's mistrust of the other before realising that if they work together they can stop Nero. <br/><br/>The casting was on the money. Some look like what you would expect the younger characters to look like in the original series but for others the mannerisms are dead on particularly Zachary Quinto, Anton Yelchin and Karl Urban who play Spock, Chekov and Bones. It was nice to see they had the Christopher Pike character that originally had featured in the series starring Jeffrey Hunter before the character was changed completely and William Shatner was cast in the main role. I thought that it was great to see the original Spock (Leonard Nimoy) as part of the plot that is convincing and not just added on as an after thought.<br/><br/>Another thing that worked so well was the acknowledgement to the past with the uniforms and the characters but adding a new, modern take with new angles to the story line and the character's development. The special effects are out of this world particularly the battle scenes and when they're using the transporters.<br/><br/>I really hope that they make another as I'm interested in seeing where they will go next."
"andrewnmiller","10","1","3","21 July 2016"," One of the few reboots that did what it needed to do.
","Growing up, I was never into Star Trek as I preferred the Star Wars films and it wasn't until I was older that my dad showed me a few episodes from the original 60s TV show did I become somewhat of a fan, but upon watching this reboot did I become a fan of Star Trek. From the visual effects to the acting and action, this movie just rocked! <br/><br/>We open in the 23rd century where the Federation starship USS Kelvin is exploring an electric storm when a Romulan ship appears out of the storm and proceeds to assault the Kelvin. Captain Robau goes aboard to negotiate a ceasefire, but while on the other ship, Robau is killed by the ship's commander, Nero who resumes attacking the Kelvin. George Kirk manages to evacuate the ship's crew as well as his pregnant wife from the ship while he heads on a crash course with the Romulan ship and sacrifices his own life. 17 years later on the planet Vulcan, Spock is allowed to enroll in a Vulcan science academy, but enrolls in Starfleet instead. Kirk has become an irresponsible but bright young man; following a bar fight, James meets Captain Christopher Pike who urges him to join Star Fleet which Kirk does. After joining, Kirk is put on trial for cheating on the Kobayashi Meru test, but the trial is interrupted by a distress call from Vulcan. Now, Kirk and Spock must learn to work together and save the universe form the Romulans.<br/><br/>Reinventing any movie franchise is never easy and Star Trek is no exception; however right when the movie starts, it becomes obvious that the old Star Trek timeline has been discontinued, many fans were unhappy with this but I think it gave the writers and Abrams a chance to give the franchise a breath of fresh air and while this isn't the Star Trek your parents grew up with, the film pays respect to the classic show, but it doesn't feel like a big tribute but rather flows with the whole legacy of Star Trek and the viewer doesn't need to have seen any of the other films in order to understand what is going on. The story feels fresh and new and provides a nice backstory for each member of the crew of the Enterprise and how they all come together not to mention each character is well-written and well-developed giving me a reason to care about them as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The relationship between Kirk and Spock is fantastic and embodies the core presence in the movie. The two aren't friends when they first meet unlike in the TV show and frequently clash, but by the end, they do set aside their differences. The interactions between the main characters are far from embarrassing and each actor plays their part perfectly.<br/><br/>Chris Pine is incredible as James T. Kirk, highlighting the arrogance and thoughtless of the character even better that Shatner and while Pine doesn't have the unusual speech display as William, you still see him as Kirk; there are even a few scenes where Chris resembles Shatner. The same can also be said for Zachary Quinto as Spock who is so convincing in the role that one can't help but be awestruck by his intelligence, his chilly and deliberate reason, and yet we do feel sympathy for him once he comes to grips with his human emotions and his scenes with Pine help us understand their loathing for each other. Karl Urban is perfect as Dr. Bones McCoy, conveying many of the same mannerisms DeForrest Kelly did in the original TV show from the way he speaks and his catch phrases to his brashness towards Spock make for an eerie similarity to Kelly's character. Anton Yelchin is delightful as Chekov and seems to be pulled straight out of the 60s show, complete with his inability to say the letter ""v"" and his mathematical wizardry. Zoe Saldana as Uhura is fabulous and is scripted as a character with a brashness that shatters the norms of well-known Star Trek lore, not to mention she is a total bad-ass when it comes to the fighting. John Cho is a worthy successor to George Takei as Sulu, showing his prowess at the helm of the Enterprise and with a sword when in action. Simon Pegg is wonderful as Scotty, playing the high-spirited engineer with utmost gusto, running around the ship screaming like a crazy person. Eric Bana is truly frightening as Nero and skillfully plays the cruel, cold-hearted Romulan with little effort. Leonard Nemoy returns as Spock Prime which is a nice call-back to the original show and it truly is a joy to see him return to his iconic role when he gives the younger Spock advice on letting go of logic and allowing his emotions to dictate his actions.<br/><br/>The visual and sound effects are truly something to write home about with all the sounds fitting the scenes they're used in while still retaining the classic Star Trek sounds with the beaming effect and the warp speed drive kicking in. The visual effects give a greater scoop and scale to space and the Federation and the design of the Enterprise is fabulous. The action is fast-paced and never lets up once during the entire film with the final shootout on the Romulan ship being the stand-out action scene for me.<br/><br/>With JJ Abrams directing this movie, you can anticipate some edgy camera work along with some tasteful lens flairs which add to the practicality and greatness of the film and the camera-work shows a fine steadiness between being stable and being chaotic, and there are plenty of great camera movements in the movie. The musical score by Michael Giacchino is fantastic too.<br/><br/>I really have no issues with this movie; it's a fun summer blockbuster that still feels like Star Trek and I highly recommend it."
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","3","20 July 2016"," Star Trek Reinvigorated
","Plenty Star Trek super fans stand by the notion that the rebooted/re-imagination that J.J. Abrams brought us in 2009 should not be considered canon or even a part of the franchise. I tend to believe Abrams did right by the franchise's history and pathed the correct way to take the series.<br/><br/>That's not to say the film doesn't ask its audience to take some leaps of faith, they certainly do. Beginning with an entirely new cast of actors playing iconic characters. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, John Cho, Simon Pegg, and the late Anton Yelchin surrounded the film with impressive young talent. Luckily, they all fit right in with the actors who previously played the crew of the Starship Enterprise, while also bringing a fresh new face to the front of the franchise.<br/><br/>Much like 2015's The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams took a relatively simple and safe approach to revamping the series with Star Trek. Take the villain for example, Nero, he's a vengeful leader of a race who demands payback against those who wronged him. In this case those people are one, in Spock. Though Eric Bana is unrecognizable and quite good as Nero, he's sort of an antagonist doing antagonistic things just so that Kirk and Spock can have something to overcome.<br/><br/>As it is a re-imagining of sorts for the crew, we get to see Spock, Kirk, and even Uhura in places we've never seen them, both physically and emotionally. I particularly enjoyed the much more involved Uhura, though I'm not sure she needed to have a romantic relationship with Spock. But it does also provide us with a more unplugged version of Spock, though obviously still emotionally guarded. In all, the characters still feel like the same old Enterprise characters from the old films and series, just with a fresh spin. And that's okay Trek fans.<br/><br/>Of course, there are quite a few gaps in the storytelling. After a highly emotional beginning with a great expanded cameo from Chris Hemsworth (up and comer at the time), I don't think the film ever reaches those gut punching heights, so from that angle, the film doesn't necessarily succeed. At other times, events happen that aren't explained well enough and warrant perhaps too much suspension of disbelief. With that said, once Leonard Nimoy steps into the film, everything begins to make a bit more sense and the entire film takes a leap forward in quality as well. It just takes a little bit to get to that point. This Star Trek reboot is far from perfect, but it's certainly nowhere near the 'dismal' quality some 'Trekkies' deem it.<br/><br/>+The Kirk and Spock relationship is the krux of the story<br/><br/>+Uhura's role amped up<br/><br/>+J.J. reinvigorated the series<br/><br/>-Some conveniences<br/><br/>-Never hits the emotional heights of the first segment<br/><br/>8.0/10"
"swilliky","8","1","3","16 July 2016"," A fun reboot of a classic sci-fi story
","The reboot of the beloved franchise turned to the remake master J.J. Abrams for the updated Star Trek. Abrams already had shown quality directing but he proved his science fiction skill with this fun and awe-inspiring new vision. I'm not as familiar with the original Star Trek films and TV show so I came into this movie with relatively little knowledge. While I didn't convert to full-on Trekkie, I did appreciate what these films had to offer. <br/><br/>The new actors were a great recasting of classic characters, and I liked everyone who appears in this film. The film introduced Chris Hemsworth to the general public before his appearance as the Marvel hero Thor. His short prologue scene was memorable enough to recall him when the Thor casting was announced plus did a great job dragging an unknowing viewer like me into the excitement of the story. The plot also takes a unique approach with a clever time travel plot that ties in the old and the new.<br/><br/>The movie served primarily as an origin for Captian James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto). It focuses on their relationship and reintroduces the beloved characters to a new audience and avid fans. Kirk was not planning on joining Star Fleet and spends his time driving fast cars and getting into barroom brawls. After one brawl over trying to get the name of a Star Fleet cadet who later turns out to be Uhura (Zoe Saldana), he is confronted by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood).<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

"cassio-raposa","5","1","3","9 July 2016"," average, not lasting impression, bad use of clichés, predictable plot.
","NOTICE: I try to respect the work of other people, so be aware that anything I write is a personal opinion and I don't believe in an absolute definition of ""good"", ""bad"", ""touching"", ""decent"", etc. Each person responds to different approaches, hence the need of different professionals. What an amazing diversity makes us humans! That being said, when I write a review giving bad scores I mean no disrespect.<br/><br/>First of all, let me state that I'm not very familiar with the Star Trek franchise. That is different from saying I'm not a Star Trek fan, because such statement would imply I have a major knowledge about the franchise. However, as a sci-fi lover I know the basics (a few names of places, characters and some background story). That being said, let's judge the movie. When I measure a how good a movie is or isn't I take a few things in consideration. Among them, the 5 most important are:<br/><br/>·Plot - SPOILER AHEAD - One thing some writers don't get right: If you are going to use time travel in your plot, try to do it in some innovative way, or at least make the time travel secondary to something more interesting. Simply using time travel to create the classic ""alternative reality"" paradox feels not dense. END OF SPOILER The comic relief is not well placed, the story is quite predictable, the characters are not believable, which leads to the next topic:<br/><br/>·Good or bad use of clichés - If your are going the cliché way, give me some good characters. Make the clichés merge within a few aspects that will create at least a little illusion of uniqueness, so we can be delighted by that amazing familiar feeling, yet still feel that we don't quite know exactly how every single move of the characters will be. There's nothing wrong with clichés. Really. In fact, it is maybe impossible to effectively avoid any use of 'em. But there are many ways of using it with more expertise.<br/><br/>·Movie's relevance within it's genre (a.k.a. movie tested against time) - Some movies make a mark. Sometimes they only have an awesome story but lack special effects, sometimes they are all about special effects and forget the story, sometimes they are extremely epic, sometimes they are just plain simple but well put together as a whole A few movies have it all. In sci-fi movies I tend to expect a good plot, or good special effects, or exotic locations, or at least one memorable character... None of it achieved in this production. If you watch ""the Matrix"" today, more then a decade and a half latter, some things will look dated. Even more if we are talking about ""Blade Runner"". However, you like it or not, both made their marks when tested against time. The examples could be many, but not this particular ""Star Trek"" movie.<br/><br/>·Special effects (if applicable) within the time of its release - Not bad, but not out of the ordinary. Since we can't always recreate the ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Terminator 2"" awe, just having decent effects is enough to grant a high score here, which is the case.<br/><br/>·Atmosphere (music and sound effects immersion, photography, filming style) - When overused, the atmosphere of a movie can give the impression that it tries to make up for the lack of quality of the story. It happens in Nolan's movies a lot (please, I'm not saying that they have or don't have decent plots, it is just my opinion that it may give the stated impression). Again, when underused, the atmosphere may give a slow paced or boring sensation, and sometimes that's desirable in a given movie. Since in this title it was used just as a car paint (it has to be there and that's the extent of it), no high score here.<br/><br/>·Conclusion - As a non Star Trek expert I had the impression that every character presented was trying to give old fans that ""oh, nice, look how Spock is amazing this time!"" comfortable feeling. As a fan of other sci-fi franchises I hate when they do that and prefer when characters are presented in a more natural way. And, when not familiar with a given franchise, I feel like that new guy who doesn't know any in-jokes and assume I'm loosing some content. Either way, it is a not very good approach. The empty and predictable plot, characters that don't feel real and overall boring atmosphere make up for a not impressive movie. It may be an interesting production for some fans, although I think opinions among them will be divided. I like to think that there is much more to Star Trek, so I'll be watching older movies and series to check if I'm right."
"seannasuti","10","1","3","7 July 2016"," A new 'Trek' for a new generation
","Long-time 'Trek' fans... hate the J.J. era 'Trek' films. But as for me, the J.J. films are very special to me. Prior to 2009, I knew jack about the 'Trek' franchise but was interested in seeing the new film once I heard that it got exceptional reviews. I watched it, loved it, I learned that my dad was a 'Trek' fan and upon numerous re-viewings, it became one of my all-time favorite films. Yes it pulled the controversial move of establishing an alternate universe and yes, the action-heavy tone is something that 'Trek' purists can't stand... but it all works. Thanks to J.J. Abrams' fantastic direction, the film establishes a terrific fast-paced and light- hearted atmosphere. And as for the whole 'alternate universe' thing, it allows the filmmakers to tell new stories with the franchise's classic characters without having to adhere to the series' canon. Even better is the film's outstanding ensemble cast. Simply put, the film makes sure to establish why every member of the crew is a valuable asset to the USS Enterprise. And it's all buoyed by fantastic performances from the two leads, Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk (my personal favorite Kirk) and Zachary Quinto as Spock. Heck, they even got the legendary Leonard Nimoy to return as older Spock, which is quite frankly one of the best 'cameos' of all- time. All of this comes together for an epic sci-fi masterpiece that is quite easily my favorite 'Trek' film."
"ajrcvr","8","1","3","16 June 2016"," Clever, interesting new remake of a classic
","Not terribly original, of course, since it is an essential remake of the original Star Trek concept, but J J Abrams did an excellent job with replicating the characters of the old series, and bringing in some new wrinkles. Zachary Quinto does a superb job with the new Spock character, & the other major characters are equally as good. Chris Pine is a great new Kirk, and the whole production keeps you interested with all the new twists and turns until the end. There are not many ways you could accomplish this type of remake, with deference to the original characters and saga while creating a new story arc, and keep it interesting, but the clever idea of changing the time line to effect a new direction for the franchise to pursue works very well and gives us a new series in friendly old 'Star Trek' clothes."
"mattkratz","8","1","3","8 May 2016"," outstanding
","This was a perfect start in the ""prequels"" for the Star Trek films. It is perfectly cast (it even has Leonard Nimoy thrown in as the ""older Spock""), and well shot and made. It takes some time to get used to different actors playing the roles, but once you do, you will love the movie. The movie starts with Jim Kirk's birth, then flash forwards thru a couple spots with key moments in his and Spock's childhoods, and then to where they ""inherit"" the Enterprise with Christopher Pike still as captain. You get to see their first adventure together as they meet and how the crew is assembled. I think this movie was terrific, as are the majority of Star Trek movies-you even to to hear a ""I'm a doctor, not a..."" line from McCoy. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"Mr-Fusion","5","1","3","10 April 2015"," They turned Star Trek into a comic book movie.
","For better or worse (which honestly depends on what you're looking for with these movies), this aging franchise has been taken back to the shop for a complete overhaul. Not a sterling reboot, but also not half-assed, as Trek has now been completely reinvented for the Summer popcorn crowd; big, noisy and amped to a manic degree. The movie is seductive in its pure balls-to-the-wall entertainment value, and even I have to admit to tuning in for a few minutes whenever this is on TV. But there are large swathe of this that don't make a lot of sense and take the wind of the sails. For one why is Nero so cheesed off at Spock Prime, the one guy who risked life and limb to help him out? This is your big bad guy? He's terrible! Also, Spock Prime just happens to be on the same planet on which Kirk's been marooned? Really? But then that sort of deus ex machina isn't so far-fetched (I guess) in a movie that bend its story over backwards to get Kirk in the command chair.<br/><br/>That said, what the movie does feature is a pretty interesting cast, the highlights of which are Chris Pine, Karl Urban and Bruce Greenwood (a thousand times, Greenwood!). If the movie works, it's wholeheartedly because of the people in these famous roles. But once the credits roll and the cheap thrills are over, the bad taste lingers.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Jamespc96","8","1","3","20 November 2014"," From a Star Wars Fan
","I was originally under the impression that if you're a Star Wars fan you're not a Star Trek fan. It's one or the other. But this film changed my outlook and I have gradually become more interested in the Trekverse. <br/><br/>I came to realize these franchises are not opposites but complementary. Star Wars is a galaxy constantly at war so it has the better the special effects and action. Star Trek has the deeper story lines and characters. It is multiple galaxies trying to maintain peace. Star Wars is what we want and Star Trek is what we are. <br/><br/>The storyline in this film isn't too weird for Star Trek standards and it does take on more action and humor than usual to make it more accessible and a good spot to start for newcomers. The storyline, as described by my friend, acts as a prequel, sequel, and reboot all at the same time. It tells how Mr. Spock, from the future, goes back in time into a parallel universe altering history as Trekkies know it. We follow younger versions of Kirk and Spock. Kirk is more rogue here than his later self but still more or less the lady killer we know him as. Mr Spock actually taking a love interest is quite dumb but nothing seriously untrue of his character is done. <br/><br/>Many Trekkies disliked this film for straying from the philosophical feels of the original, but don't you want to convert at least a few non followers? The original series may seem a bit dull without a good solid introduction to the characters. To take one of their points, the story could be a bit more complicated and the villain could have been better but these are all small things that don't distract from a good science fiction flick. <br/><br/>I recommend Trekkies show this to any stubborn Star Wars fan that wants nothing to do with Star Trek."
"dyonchristopher","10","1","3","4 May 2014"," Masterpiece
","Star trek was one of the best films ever made. Definitely the best of 2009 although Avatar was pretty good. The acting is great and the cast are perfect to match the incredible characters they play. Sound effects, action, soundtrack and the theme are all incredible. This first movie of the reboot was literally better than into darkness by only one star. That's only because I didn't like the admirals lame daughter who was a waste of time and just someone for Khan to hurt which put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Overall, Abrams' should be given a whole lot more credit for directing this masterpiece of a movie. Its practically impossible not to like this movie. I got this on DVD in 2013 four years after it came out which I missed in cinema. Worst feeling of my life knowing I missed out on such a great movie for four years."

","J.J. Abrams reboots the Star Trek franchise with a whole new cast. Chris Pine is a leading man Kirk with less overacting. Quite frankly, there's no way to overact more than Shatner. Zoe Saldana is a sexy Uhura. Simon Pegg adds more comedy to Scotty. Zachary Quinto is the one that truly shines as the new Spock.<br/><br/>J.J. does a bit of a cheat in the story construction. It's an alternate universe. Of course that's perfectly acceptable in the sci-fi world. It also helps that J.J. is shooting in a different style than every other Star Trek movie. It is more action oriented, more glowy, more flashy, and more camera flares than humanly possible. More than all the others, it's good popcorn fun."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","3","16 August 2013"," One of the most shamelessly entertaining films of the past few years
","After Captain Picard and his crew crash-landed at the box office with Star Trek: Nemesis (2002) and the TV series Star Trek: Enterprise was canned, the Star Trek franchise was at a dead-end and in desperate need of fresh eyes. After TV success with the likes of Alias and Lost, and a decent franchise entry in Mission: Impossible III (2006) - which brought the series back on course after John Woo's horrible first sequel - in stepped J.J. Abrams, along with writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. This would be a complete re-boot, going back to the very beginning of the careers of the characters from the original series - Kirk, Spock, Scotty et al, who are now some of the most recognisable faces in popular culture.<br/><br/>Born amidst the heroic death of his father, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a rash, headstrong, yet intelligent adrenaline junkie, who, after a bar fight with some Starfleet cadets, is convinced by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in Starfleet academy. On Vulcan, Spock (Zachary Quinto) faces the decision whether to give himself over completely to the logic-based Vulcan way of life of his father, or embrace the emotions brought on by his human mother. After being invited to join the Vulcan Science Acacemy, but taking offence at a suggestion that his humanity is a 'disadvantage', Spock declines and enlists in Starfleet. Three years later, the cadets find themselves on the Enterprise commanded by Pike, where they answer a distress signal from Vulcan, who are facing destruction from Romulan Nero (Eric Bana).<br/><br/>While admittedly not a fan himself, Abrams clearly doesn't want to upset the huge fanbase that this franchise attracts, going as far as using a clever plot device that allows the rookie characters to pursue their own path, and therefore not eradicating everything that happened back when William Shatner was hamming it up. Occasionally, you'll see Shatner in Chris Pine, but Pine makes Kirk very much his own. Kirk is the humanity of the story - cocky and arrogant to the point of dangerous, but capable and confident like every leader needs to be, and here we see him discover where to draw the line. He is the polar opposite to Quinto's Spock, who, at this point of the story, is a cold, angry presence, but inwardly fighting his natural instinct to balance logic with emotion, seeing weakness in his humanity.<br/><br/>It is the interactions between these two characters that form the emotional core of the film, with the characters naturally learning from each other and starting on the path that would lead to their great friendship. This being an origin story, the focus should naturally be on character development, so Bana's Nero, although nailing the short time he has on screen, doesn't get much of a look in, becoming not much more than a plot device that allows the crew of the Enterprise to pull together. However, Nero's ruthlessness does allow for some fine action scenes, and one genuinely shocking moment. There's less 'set phasers to stun' and more hand-to-hand combat in the vein of the Bourne trilogy, with Spock displaying some chopsocky skills and Sulu (John Cho) revealing some unknown kung-fu abilities (he is Asian, after all!).<br/><br/>It won't please all the fans, certainly not the hardcore Trekkies. Original creator Gene Roddenberry fused philosophy and science and gave the world a series that, on the surface, could be misconstrued as just another cheesy sci-fi series from the 1960's, but was rooted in something far deeper and more intelligent. Abrams take on Star Trek all but throws away these ideas, and focuses more on action and comedy, aspects of the traditional blockbuster. Myself, I've seen very little of the TV series, so this didn't bother me in the slightest. Although I think the original Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) has an unfair bad rep, I generally find the original movie series quite tedious and very hit-and-miss (something the fans will admit), so I welcome the new take. It's Star Trek for the modern age, but shows enough respect for what came before that a fine balance is created, and, some lazy plot devices aside, is one of the most shamelessly entertaining films of the past few years."

","You'd have to be living under a rock on Delta Vega to have never heard of the Star Trek franchise. Ever since its (tragically-cancelled) run in the 60s, this quaint sci-fi adventure show spawned a dozen films, half-a-dozen spin off TV shows, and a massive fan base that could constitute its own nation (complete with its own language, customs, and dress code). Slight problem with some of the original films is that they cater specifically to the Trekkies; most casual audiences might find some amusement among the even-numbered films, but the entire saga is a nerd haven more than anything.<br/><br/>So, in 2009, this reboot was released with the casual audience in mind. Even if you've never liked or heard of Star Trek before, this film totally rocks! From start to finish, there's loads of spectacular space battles, shootouts, fistfights, and occasional bursts of witty (and rather silly) humor. The pacing is tight, and the movie overall carries an adventurous spirit that hasn't really been used since Star Wars. At the same time, die-hard Trekkies should be relieved to see some familiar faces, hear some familiar lines, and witness the occasional homage to the classics.<br/><br/>The story might seem off-putting at first, but it all comes together and brilliantly kicks off a franchise that's distinct and separate from the previous incarnations of Trek. It's pretty darn fun seeing the origins of the characters and how they come together. The characters themselves are very well-developed and portrayed; it's hard not to like the lot of them, and they do exceptional justice to the original characters. I also admire the film for showing some of the dangers and peril of space travel.<br/><br/>Coming from JJ Abrams, you can expect some jittery camera-work and some stylish lens flares; some people find them annoying, but I think they add to the realism and intensity of the film. Otherwise, the camera-work shows a fine balance between being steady and being hectic, and there are plenty of good camera movements and angles. Editing is decent too. Acting is superb; I initially found Chris Pine a little off as Kirk, but the man does emphasize the arrogance and impulsiveness of Kirk with some degree of accuracy. Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban are perfect as Spock and McCoy, respectively. I enjoy the performances of Zoe Saldana, Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood, Simon Pegg, John Cho, and Anton Yelchin. Winona Ryder is in the mix too, and I didn't even know it was her playing Spock's mom until later. Writing is good overall; the plot is laid out in a way that's neither too high-brow or too low-brow. Production value is decent; it's pretty obvious that they filmed many scenes at a beer factory, but most camera tricks are incredibly convincing, and it shows magnificent prowess at using less to make more. A lot of it also serves to make things look creditable; transporter beams, warp drive, red matter, etc all appear scientifically plausible. So overall, there are lots of interesting sets, props, costumes, and gorgeous special effects. Music is surprisingly catchy.<br/><br/>Recommended! 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"
"zurnd","10","1","3","4 May 2013"," A Brilliant Revamp Of A Classic Series
","I'm a huge fan of Star Wars, that is no doubt, but I was always a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation which often aired on Spike TV or the CW during my schooldays. I was never really into the original Star Trek and never understand it as much as The Next Generation, but all of that would change once J.J. Abrams' reboot graced the screens. 2009's Star Trek is not only my favorite Star Trek film (that might change when Into Darkness comes out), but one of my favorite sci-fi films in general and it really delivers in so many areas which I'll cover as the review materializes. It is a fact that Abrams didn't create Star Trek, but the way he revisions it is really something breathtaking. He reimagines the worlds that Roddenberry incepted in a more modernized and stylized fashion and it fits for today's movie going and sci-fi loving audience. Hopefully, this is something that carries on when Abrams helms Star Wars: Episode 7 and let's hope that if Abrams includes lens flares in that film, he makes them work in their own right and doesn't make them distracting from the rest of the picture. <br/><br/>Getting back to Star Trek, Abrams shows his talent for storytelling as well as his understanding of the Star Trek lore and mythos. Even though this is an entirely new Trek based on an old Trek, it still has that outgoing, adventurous Star Trek feeling that really makes it stand out from all the other films in the 11 (soon to be 12) film series. Simple put, this is a film Gene Roddenberry would be most proud of, for it showcases his brainchild in a new shell and in a new light. All our favorite Star Trek characters have their place with James Tiberius Kirk and Spock leading the pack. Of course, Kirk is more troublesome and slick in this version, but he still retains the leadership and benevolence of Shatner's Kirk and the ability to take on the command chair. Spock is also much more emotional and aggressive this time around, but still retains what made the character stand out to begin with and he even gets a few pointers from the old Spock, played brilliantly by the legendary Leonard Nimoy. <br/><br/>All the other characters are spot on as well. Uhura is the sassy chick with a skill for communications, Bones is the ill tempered medical expert, Sulu is the high flying swordsman, Chekov is the mathematical wiz, and Scotty is the rambunctious engineer who loves to shout and run around like a loon. The main villain of the film, Nero, played by Eric Bana is also a highlight, delivering that perfect balance of tyranny and determination to take out the good guys. He's one dude you don't want to pee off and when you do, he'll impale you with his sharp staff of terror. As I said before, the great Nimoy is in this picture and he portrays the prime Spock in a dignified, wise manner. He tells his younger self to put aside logic and do what he feels is right and persuades him to stay in Starfleet, saying that he can't deprive him of his inevitable friendship with Kirk. <br/><br/>The special effects and sound effects are also something to write home about. The man behind Star Wars' sound effects, Ben Burtt did the sound effects for this film and they are very Star Trek like and fitting for each scene they are in. The space battles sound like Star Trek space battles and when characters are beamed off the Enterprise, it's the classic transporter sound from the 60s TV show. I also like the Phaser sound effect, not exactly like the classic sound from the show, but really intriguing and sci-fi like. Instead of the fizzing sound from the original, this phaser sound effect is more of a solid clink or clank. I also admire the new design of the Enterprise, which is obviously much bigger and more advanced than the one in the original show. The bridge also doesn't have all those massive buttons and levers, it looks much more advanced and technological. <br/><br/>Although this film is well loved, many Trekkies were offended by this flick, feeling that it was less of Star Trek and more of a mindless action flick. Abrams did however reboot the franchise in a way that it doesn't ignore the other Star Trek series, but you'll have to see the movie yourself to understand what I'm talking about. It really is an excellent movie and it doesn't require you to know about Star Trek to get into it. Hopefully, Abrams can carry on the same magic in the upcoming sequel, and fingers crossed that he will reboot The Next Generation. James Franco as Riker, anyone? Just kidding."
"vid8","8","1","3","6 June 2012"," A reasonable effort
","I'll be honest, before watching this movie I was very sceptical that they'd actually pull it off. To my surprise, I did actually enjoy the movie, it was action-packed right till the end.<br/><br/>Chris Pine did exceptionally well as Kirk, showing the arrogance and ego that William Shatner once did, and rebelling against protocol as always. Quinto performed reasonably well as Spock, but was overshadowed by the sheer greatness of Leonard Nimoy, who played Spock Prime. Nimoy just ghosted back into the role, and had not forgotten a single thing, he played Spock very well, just like he has always done. I also liked the casting of Zoe Saldana as Uhura, who became involved in a very surprising relationship with another main character.<br/><br/>The music from the original series was not added till the very end, which was a good decision, as we would've thought it'd be like the original series if they'd put it at the beginning, which it certainly wasn't: the uniforms were different and the ships were far more high-tech than the ones seen in the past TV series'. I'd like to see more of this, and the film can be enjoyable for old fans, new fans, and non-fans alike; the old fans can still get into it because it is set in an alternate reality, the new fans are new fans because of it, and non-fans would enjoy the action that the film shows."
"flute_ian","8","1","3","3 January 2012"," Exceeded Expectations
","Having suffered the post-Gene Trek franchise, I was prepared for the worst. So I have to give J.J. Abrams credit for washing the bitter taste of the Berman-era out of my psyche with this decent effort.<br/><br/>I had only one major disappointment, and that was the music underscore.<br/><br/>The composers for TOS were adept writers, steeped in Stravinsky and Prokofiev. TNG was fine until they made the boneheaded move of firing Ron Jones, a Ravel aficionado. And James Horner did fine work in the early movies.<br/><br/>With this new movie, it sounds like Abrams has hired a video game composer with severely limited abilities. All I could do was try to ignore this underscore and focus on all other elements of the film.<br/><br/>I hope they pay more attention to this issue in the sequel.<br/><br/>There were a few elements that didn't quite work for me, one being the dialect of Nero which sounds obviously American. The first Romulan we ever saw in TOS was Mark Lenard, and his dialect seemed credible. This wrong accent for Nero causes one to see an actor at work, instead of a believable character.<br/><br/>On the subject of casting, I realize this was the most difficult challenge of all, and I think they did very well re: Kirk-Spock-McCoy-Uhura. Sulu-Chekov-Scotty-Pike-Sarek were not as convincing.<br/><br/>One element that makes me feel trepidation about the upcoming sequel is the angle of the timeline alteration. Will Abrams use this as an excuse to destroy Gene's beautiful vision and revert to the destructive negativity so characteristic of the Berman era ?? Wiping out Vulcan was a pretty extreme plot angle. Also, I felt the torture scene was a bit much for a film kids will see, especially in an era where a recent Vice-President of the USA champions waterboarding.<br/><br/>If, in this upcoming sequel, Abrams chooses to steer the ship off course a la Berman, that will be it for me and I will stick to the beautifully buffed TOS-DVD release.<br/><br/>update MAY 2013 re: STII: re: *Will Abrams use this as an excuse to destroy Gene's beautiful vision and revert to the destructive negativity so characteristic of the Berman era ??* <br/><br/>In reading IMDb reviewers' posts now, I get the impression that JJA has indeed gone off-course in this way but I will have to try to summon the courage to get to the theatre to see indeed if we are now burdened by yet another ST-producer who just doesn't *get it*"

","As a non-start trek fan i came into this film wondering if i was going to understand what was going on or if it would appeal to non-fans like myself. Luckily you didn't need to have watched every Star Trek movie/TV episode ever made, but it may have helped. Its not a necessity to do this but its just that the plot seemed confusing at times. But i wouldn't complain about it too much because it is easier to understand after a few watches plus you have the spectacular CGI effects to keep you entertained. When i saw this i was blown away by the sheer brilliance of the visual masterpiece before my very own eyes. The whole look of the film had a futuristic, sci-fi and fantasy element to it which i loved. Even the characters were good, they were well cast and enjoyable to watch. Overall a really enjoyable watch for all fantasy/sci-fi lovers."

An alternate reality means they can do so much with it, e.g sequels etc.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about this film is how is stuck to the original Star Trek roots but at the same time offered a worldwide appeal and something different for the new Audiences.<br/><br/>The effects we're also worth mentioning as they we're very good.<br/><br/>But what i like most was the acting. Chris Pine brought a new shine to James Kirk, we saw a completely new side to him, and half the time he was bloody. Spock was still Leonard Nimoy, and younger Spock was (Heroes - Sylar) Zachary Quinto who portrayed Spock very well. My favourite Character has to be Karl Urban as Bones, He was just brilliant, funny and very well acted.<br/><br/>Also Eric Bana makes a good Bad Guy, if you've ever watched Chopper (2000) then that will be enough for you.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams should be praised for the fantastic Reboot.<br/><br/>All in all, well worth a watch."

","First of all, I'm a Next Generation, Piccard/Janeway Star Trek fan. The original series was comical and everything after Next Generation was pretty weak.<br/><br/>Having said that, this movie is targeted towards pre-teen dorkisauris and anyone who's still alive that watched the original star trek series. For the modern day, average sci-fi buff, this movie offered little draw, except for the concept of destroying worlds and the fights between the rogue Romulans and the Federation.<br/><br/>Also, the movie did not flow like the Next Generation based movies have. It jumped from point to point and if you did not know everything about the history of Spock and Kirk, you might have had to rewind it just so you caught everything. For the average ADHD viewer, this might not mattered anyway.<br/><br/>And uh so Spock just happens to be on the SAME PLANET that Kirk ends up on? Uh OK, I'll believe that one.<br/><br/>Overall good cheese, but I have high standards for Star Trek thanks to Piccard and Janeway. If I wasn't biased towards them I might have given it a 7."

But the emotional aspects work beautifully, while the revenge plot and the action scenes could have been more innovative. Anyway, the whole scenario - including the good special effects - is surprisingly believable and the screenplay finds the right balance between fun and earnestness, between homage and autonomy.<br/><br/>Some more narrative surprises next time and we're in for a really good sci-fi movie series.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 red matter attacks"
"lists-9","8","1","3","26 September 2009"," An action-packed, fun ride
","As a fan of the original series who has just forked out a tidy sum for the Blu-ray version of Season 1, I have to say that the new film pushed all the buttons for me.<br/><br/>The opening is absolutely terrific, with both action and emotion and, apart from a few minutes in the middle of the film, the pace hardly slackens throughout. <br/><br/>Most of the cast are thoroughly engaging – I particularly enjoyed the performances of Christopher Pine, Karl Urban (doing a brilliant version of DeForest Kelley) and Zachary Quinto. The only character who didn't entirely come off in my book was Scotty. Simon Pegg's Scots accent is better than James Doohan's, but the film's attempts at comedy are its least successful aspect and come across as rather laboured. There are certainly scenes that are more reminiscent of Star Wars (a franchise that doesn't appeal to me) than Star Trek, but this didn't offend me at all. While the time travel device is used in a fairly unsubtle way, and purists can no doubt pick various holes in the plot, is this is really important in an action film? Star Trek sets out to entertain and, in this respect, it succeeds completely.<br/><br/>I don't think it's giving anything away to say that the script does two odd things with the character of Spock, that are most apparent towards the end of the film. It'll be interesting to see how these oddities develop in any sequels.<br/><br/>and while I'm talking about sequels, if the team are looking for stories from the original series to remake or ""re-imagine"", forget Khan and the Tribbles – how about the classic The Menagerie/The Cage? The original story cried out for realistic settings and the Talosians, cleverly realised as they were, could no doubt be done even better in the 21st century. It can't be beyond the wit of Hollywood's writers to think of some apposite new twist to the theme of mind control"

","Berman must feel betrayed. 'If I'd had that budget, and been allowed changes to canon, style and characters, I'd have given you a blockbuster, and stood on less toes too,' he probably thinks! Some became disenchanted with Berman, but maybe now they'll realise why he policed everything: to keep continuity and style safe. Abrams does the opposite - staying close to aspects, but completely altering others. Little things, like phasers firing a pulse, not a beam. Things that have been adhered to for 43 years!<br/><br/>Supposedly there are infinite stories to be told. True, but not all will make sense. The ultimate get-out clause, the cure-all 'alternate timeline', doesn't resolve all plot problems. There's plenty to enjoy (surprisingly, I got past a lot you'd expect to be upset about such as new actors), but I can't understand people giving it 10/10. Watch previous Treks and discover there's more to it than big bangs. Although if it encourages people to watch the legendary back catalogue then it'll be worthwhile.<br/><br/>The opening was powerful and tragic with a real sense of scale and weight. You care about these people you've never met, maybe because they're true, new pieces of Trek lore. Robau and the Kelvin crew intrigued me more than the Enterprise and hers! And we got some of the real timeline: George Kirk served on the Kelvin and Jim would have been born there. The early life of characters is a perfect period to bring to screen because we know so little. Unfortunately what we do know is eroded until they're practically tearing it all apart! We've waited long to discover how Kirk became Captain and other details only to have them served up, then snatched away with the 'revelation' of an alternate timeline.<br/><br/>Trek is a hot property Paramount's often been accused of not taking seriously. They have now, booting out the old team and rules, and throwing money into it, but screech to a halt if you care about past Trek. This tells you that's all gone. I was hoping for a giant, red reset button dangling in space like 'red matter' to put things right, but no. This is 'Star Trek' on steroids, with no responsibility to the past.<br/><br/>Early promise of heart-tugging elements is lost for the remainder. Only shock and horror is experienced as Spock's world and Mother, crumble. Why was action the focus at the expense of these moments, which previous films captured so well? 'Action' would have been improved immeasurably if the camera hadn't been dancing a merry jig. It's as if the old joke about the actors throwing themselves around whenever the ship was attacked was employed in every other scene!<br/><br/>Some characters do things for no reason, that wouldn't mean anything to casual viewers, but shock regulars. Uhura and Spock. Kissing. Touching! Vulcans don't like to touch, whatever timeline you're in. The power of Spock as an alien is lost. The mindmeld also had no mystery to it, making it a lot less powerful.<br/><br/>Kirk seemed a precocious, slimy brat. It's a common misconception Kirk was a smutty ladies man. If you look at the evidence (see 'Star Trek Magazine' #136), you see he actually had a stable, gentlemanly persona. But it doesn't matter: it's alternate, they cry! That could be liberating for new ideas, but constraints breed inventiveness and I don't see how throwing the established universe out, so the writers can have an easier time, will help tell good stories.<br/><br/>Vulcan's destruction is harsh, but most shocking of all, is Romulus' destruction in the 'proper' timeline, leaving us wondering what this means for the 24th century, and frustrated we may never find out! What made this a good film, beyond the spectacle was Leonard Nimoy, there once and for all. Enjoyable as the in-jokes are, it's like the writers are chucking regular viewers table scraps, believing we should be grateful, while everyone else swallows an ignorant feast.<br/><br/>The humour's a nod to the original, but some (gribblies chasing Kirk; Scotty washed down the plughole), leaned dangerously into parody. The Orion scene contributes to the overall distaste at some of the character's actions. - It's sad to see Spock show no compassion for the Romulans, the writers choosing to show these 'heroes' as no better than their enemies at the expense of a cheap joke.<br/><br/>An example of illogic to turn Vulcan's ears purple is Real Spock encouraging Kirk to rile his younger self, rather than tell the truth: to gain control of the ship, and supposedly cement their friendship... by causing young Spock unnecessary grief? The way everyone accepts Nero's crew as Romulans without batting a double eyelid is an oversight as humans had no knowledge of the Vulcan connection! They try to distance themselves from continuity, though ironically there's little that hasn't been taken from previous films.<br/><br/>Chekov was forced, perhaps because he was the youngest actor (though not as young as in Old Trek - apparently his parents gave birth to him sooner thanks to Nero!). Kirk and Spock were sometimes visible as themselves, but other times plainly wrong. McCoy was closest, Scotty was similar, apart from the overdose of zaniness. Majel Barrett-Roddenberry wasn't obvious in the computer voice, but the dedication to her and Gene was appreciated. The musical theme was strong, but while I enjoyed it, it's literally forgettable, unlike the other scores in the series.<br/><br/>Exciting film, not great, nor strongly 'Star Trek' in tone. Will we come to accept it? If they begin to repair the timeline, perhaps. It may have broken box office records, but it's also broken a lot of hearts... Less standing on the shoulders of giants, than kicking their faces in, and spitting on their grave!<br/><br/>(If they dare call the next film 'Star Trek 2', they may as well subtitle it 'The Wrath of Fans'!)"

Doesn't really sound like Star Trek, but it is. At least it is in it's Universe. I guess that is, what makes the Fans so angry. It is less nerdish, more mainstream. Me and 90% of all the visitors will call it ""better"" but that is because my focus was always different on the Star Trek movies, than that of a Trekkie.<br/><br/>Enogh said for now. If you want a movie with cool characters,intelligent humor, action and Sci-Fi in it - go watch it!

"ChrisTreborn","9","2","10","31 December 2009"," Best Film of 2009
","I have been waiting for this moment, the end of 2009 to write the review which film should be crowned as the Best of this year. And after waiting for Avatar to release, I must say J.J Abrams' STAR TREK deserve the title to be The Best Film Of 2009.<br/><br/>Based on a 1960s TV series, which got great fan-base and cult following, director J.J Abrams tells an original fresh tale with a different take. As the previous sequels failed in the box office the production company Paramount pictures originally intended for a Reboot, many talented well known directors decline to take over the project. But things really changed when Paramount decided to give the baby to the new blood of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (who showed their reputation in dealing with preexisting materials, as in the movies Mission Impossible 3 and Transformers, which all got preexisting settings and their universe) created an important decision not to make a Reboot to the beloved 40 year old franchise. Their take was to make a sequel which really reinvents the beginning of Star Trek Franchise. And reuniting with director J.J Abrams we got both Visually as well as Story wise a great Cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Star Trek (2009) (*****)<br/><br/>Movie starts with a time traveled captain Nero(Eric Bana) who is looking for Ambassador Spock/Spock Prime(Leonard Nimoy), leading to the destruction of an entire star-ship. His quest for finding Spock was not only to hurt him, but to take revenge on all people who were responsible for the death of his beloved wife and their unborn child.<br/><br/>Things went wrong when a young outcast cadet James T. Kirk(Chris Pine) comes against Nero.<br/><br/>Based on the original characters created by Gene Roddenberry, director J.J Abrams with writers Roberto Orci,Alex Kurtzman tells the Eleventh chapter of STAR TREK saga. Frankly I am not a big TREKKIE fan, but I must say, I like this film for what it stands for. This film got lot of potential, even in story narration as well as in technical side.<br/><br/>I didn't get the chance to see it on theaters, (because of my studies) but while watching it on DVD it got the Big spirit to shake my eyes away. As a VFX student I must give credits to all CGI artist for bringing this Giant out. Especially J.J Abrams for his signature Jerky Hand Held Camera works, which was new to a Sci-Fi movie, really gave an impression of Reality. And his visual sense for using Lens Flare in almost for all major scenes made exploitation of reality into a whole new another level.<br/><br/>Also the editing done by Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon for the camera works of Daniel Mindel made this captivating story into an action packed bonanza. And the cast assembled for this movie was so brilliant, that it fueled the proper tone for a canonical story. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto nailed their parts, but it was Eric Bana who really shined in the picture. (I hated all his previous films starting with Hulk!) I think it was his performance as the revenging antagonist that really made the whole story worked. Also Zoe Saldana's best performance this year apart from Sucking Avatar! Anything bad in this movie was it's music done by J.J's usual collaborator Michael Giacchino. He done an average job in doing space craft action scores, but failed miserably dealing with emotional parts. Especially Spock loosing his mother, his whole planet, there was no affective moods to enrich the scene. Even the trailer music(""Two Steps From Hell"" done by composers Nick Phoenix and Thomas J. Bergersen)was well known for it's dramatic tone. Abrams really should work with a good composer like John Powell or Brian Tyler.<br/><br/>Anyway I really enjoyed this movie, it can capture both fan and no-fan audience alike. It's the Best Film of this year, I give this movie 10 out of 10 ! and I am waiting for the sequel in the Future.<br/><br/>Star Trek = Best film of 2009"

","I saw this twice in theaters and I feel like I've only seen it once. That's how good it is. If I saw it three thousand times, I would still not be tired of it. If you know me, which you don't, then you (don't) know that I'm a huge movie snob. I don't like a movie unless it's absolutely brilliant, and Star Trek lived up to that impossible title in every aspect. First off, no previous knowledge of the 1960s Star Trek series is required as this story serves as a sort of prequel to the whole shebang and details the early life of party boy James T. Kirk (played by a fantastic Chris Pine) and hilariously emotionless Spock (Zachary Quinto is an absolute Godsend for this role). The action scenes exemplify perfection of the use of modern special effects, one of the bonuses to the 30+ (give or take some, depending on whether or not you count the following series) year gap in the making of this film versus the series, while not overdoing it to the point of some shizbucket like ""Bangkok Dangerous."" Moments of humor spike the film in all the right places, especially when Scotty (Simon Pegg) is involved and the cameo appearance of Leonard Nimoy as well as other subtle reference to the old series create smirk-worthy moments for hard-core Trekkers/Trekkies top off the 2009 Star Trek film and make it perfect for everyone, be you noob or not."

","While a tribute to favorite characters of the original series, this movie should appeal to an audience with no prior knowledge of Star Trek as well. Not a single dud performance to be seen, the storyline is clever and maintains interest for the duration of the film. Every performer both in front of and behind the camera should take a bow. Beautifully photographed, and a feast for the eye and ear, this film has become a favorite for me at first viewing. Not a remake, but an addition of unparalleled quality. Blu-ray, takes full advantage of the film and is best viewed in this format for the ultimate experience. Gene Roddenberry, would be both proud and amazed, no doubt.

","Some TV shows become famous.<br/><br/>Some become legends.<br/><br/>And some are Star Trek.<br/><br/>This big-screen reboot of the most famous television show in history is a masterpiece, blending a reverence for its origins into a modern update of a classic franchise. The special effects were absolutely stunning, but more than anything, this movie is a glorious feast for Trekkies old and new alike. It is so identifiably Star Trek without being a pale imitation that I can easily understand why it's called the best Star Trek movie to date.<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino's score is a masterpiece. The thundering orchestra as the Enterprise is revealed for the first time is guaranteed to send shivers down anyone's spine, but the ending - the grand recapitulation of the original series' main theme in glorious stereo - brings tears to the eyes.<br/><br/>It is, however, the actors who make the show. Cho, Yelchin and Saldana are divine. Karl Urban as the country doctor Leonard 'Bones' McCoy brings a rough, raw sex appeal to DeForest Kelley's 'piss-and-vinegar' grumbles. Urban was a Trekkie growing up and it shows, as he nails the character every scene. His chemistry with Pine, as well, is off the charts, to the point where many fans indulge the same speculation about new-Kirk and new-McCoy that the original Trekkies carried on about Kirk and Spock so many decades ago.<br/><br/>But the high points, as in the original series, are Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine as the immortal, dynamic duo Spock and Kirk.<br/><br/>Quinto spent hours discussing Spock with Leonard Nimoy. His Spock is utterly believable, and Quinto perfectly embodies Spock's struggle between emotion and reason, humanity and Vulcan teachings. As he walks onto the bridge to offer himself as First Officer, anyone familiar with the original series can see the echo - and the beginning - of Leonard Nimoy's immortal character - a little rough, perhaps, with more emotion still than he would like, but he is so utterly, recognizably Spock it sent chills down my spine. And Quinto's chemistry with Pine makes it unbelievably easy to believe that this is just the beginning of ""a friendship that will define them both."" Which leads me in to Chris Pine as Captain James T. Kirk. Pine watched some Star Trek to prepare for the role, but stopped because he didn't want to copy Shatner's performance. He was so right - no one could ever have done what Shatner did with the role. But it doesn't matter, because everything Kirk is glows out of his eyes, his face, his voice, his gestures. That derring-do, devil-may-care attitude we all know and love is tempered with the fierce, undying loyalty that made Kirk the best Starfleet captain the Trekiverse has ever seen, and Pine manages to convey both no matter what the situation. He becomes Kirk, different perhaps thanks to a different childhood but still utterly, heartbreakingly recognizable.<br/><br/>In the end, for new fans, the movie is sure to draw them into the franchise. For old-time Trekkies, it is an achingly beautiful homage to the very best of Star Trek, the spirit that made it famous and its lead characters into archetypes themselves - and I believe that Urban, Quinto, and Pine, with their talent and their chemistry, can carry those archetypes to a new generation.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the sequel."

","Before I saw this movie I was never really a fan of Star Trek. I had heard it was a good show and had a few good movies but I had never seen anything of Star Trek. But my grandpa was a huge fan of the series and was excited to see the new movie. He asked me to come along and I thought to myself sure, why not? While I was watching this movie I was completely immeresed in it. This movie is excellent. Tha acting is good, the action and effects are awesome and the character development was pretty good as well. If your not a Star Trek fan and your worried that you won't understand anything about this movie then your wrong. This is a complete reboot of the Star Trek series. This movie is one of the few good summer movies to come out. I had heard that in the old television series Spock was played by Lenoard Nimoy. Fans will like how he comes into the Star Trek series one last time as Spock. I have heard that they will make another Star Trek and that one will be pretty good I think. If you haven't seen this then see it because it is a good movie."

","It's about time. Just about everybody who's worth his salt (and even some who isn't) has got a ""begins"" - Batman, Logan, Agent 007, Lycans and Vampires, even John Connor in a temporal-reversal style. Kirk, Spock and company may be coming lately, but they did it with a bang!<br/><br/>The Enterprise nobody dares to touch but everything else and everyone got revitalized, delightfully. Between Sherlock Holmes logic (after eliminating all other possibilities, whatever remains, however improbable, is the truth) and Asimov science facts (singularity, supernova, black hole), young Kirk and young Spock bring a new life to the franchise, a 21st century vitality. The dialogue, even if you have reservation in describing as ""intelligent"", is far from being dumb and clueless as you find in many other movies in the genre. For example, in the Spock-to-Spock scene (I'll come back to it), old Spock's farewell is ""Good luck"", as he explains that he doesn't to self-indulgent and self-serving. You'll smile when you remember that earlier in the movie, a piece of information has been imparted to you twice: the customary parting words between two Vulcans are ""Live long, and prosper"".<br/><br/>While there is the currently fashionable temporal juggling and alternate life-line elements (just seen in ""Terminator: Salvation), the main plot line is actually quite simple – evil Captain Nero's plan to destroy Vulcan, then Earth, through planting certain ""red matters"" (using a most hideous-looking set piece you've ever seen – a drill that looks like a spine torn our from a ghastly prehistoric monster) to induce the formation of a black hole (a nice mix of science fiction and science fact). That provides necessary ground for some excellent special effect as well as cliff-hanging action (from lazar shootout to sabre duel).<br/><br/>The real fun, however, is in watching how the familiar characters have been revitalized, to what they are in their youthful days. The main event is of course the double-flip yin-and-yang relationship between Kirk and Spock, from rivalry to friendship. The ultimate irony is that stoic, logical Vulcan Spock ends up resigning his command of the Enterprise from being ""emotionally compromised"". Chris Pine, coming off an impressive performance in ""Bottle shock"" (2008), bring the same youthful rebellion to give the audience a Jim Kirk that they can root for, and follow (to new Star Trek 12, presumably). Veteran TV star Zachary Quinto (special ""Heroes""), while not immediately becoming a Nimoy (let's be fair – who can?), shows promises that he'll bring a new presence into Spock as he goes along.<br/><br/>But it's not just those two. Beautiful Zoe Saldana (""The Terminal"" (2004) and ""Vantage point"" (2008)) is a welcomed Uhura. Karl Urban, best remembered to me as Eomer (LOTR), is immediately convincing as Bones. John Cho and Anton Yelchin fill their respective niches as Sulu and Chekov admirably, and you may remember Yelchin, if you have seen ""Terminator: Salvation"" recently, as John Connor's father Kyle Reese as a teenager (sans Russian accent, of course). Last, but not least, is one of today's best British comedy actors Simon Pegg playing Scotty.<br/><br/>Just to start this new franchise and probably not coming back are Brice Greenwood and Eric Bana, symbolizing good and evil. Last, but not least, is he who re-defines the word ""icon"" – Leonard Nimoy, playing an old Spock appearing from out of a time warp (or some such thing), hence the Spock-to-Spock scene refereed to earlier. Just to see Mr. Nimoy is worth the ticket price. Bring them on....all the way new Star Trek 12.....we are waiting."

From the outset you're thrown straight into the thick of it, bearing witness to the first of many in-space battles & James T Kirk's (Chris Pine) birth.<br/><br/>Yes it's a step back in time, a homage to the original series from the 60s (same outfits in the primary colours, sound effects etc.) but it's not how it was. All thanks to a parallel universe. One that answers the question; how different would Kirk be without his father's influence as he grew up. Would he still become Captain of the famous U.S.S. Enterprise? Well no, not at first. On the Enterprise's maiden voyage it's Pike (Bruce Greenwood) then Spock (Zachary Quinto), at the helm with Kirk (who at the time was suspended from The Starfleet Academy) not even supposed to be on-board. Karl Urban's comedic performance as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy when he smuggles Kirk on-board is one of the highlights. After a chance encounter with future, older Spock (a wonderful guest appearance from Leonard Nimoy), some light relief from 'Scotty' (Simon Pegg) & a temper tantrum from the younger, normally calm & logical Spock; all is right & Kirk takes his seat on the bridge.<br/><br/>All parts are perfectly cast in this is brilliant summer blockbuster.

Not at all.<br/><br/>This movie DELIVERED. <br/><br/>I walked in to Star Trek with nearly no previous knowledge of the Star Trek universe.

Then there's Michael Giachinno, the composer who delivered a fantastic new theme that I rushed to figure out on my bassoon.

","I call myself a ""reformed Trekkie"". In truth,I'm sort of a ""Weekend Trekkie"" or ""Trek hobbyist"",following the original with quite a bit of interest as a teen(though,curiously,NOT so devoted as to become one of those mythic conventioneers)and then latching onto ""Next generation"" through late high school into college,even following with some interest ""Deep Space Nine"" for the first season or two. I lost my interest after that,and despite some efforts to try to hook into the TV relaunch effort that was ""Enterprise"",my interest fizzled some then. Then,there were the movies,which varied in quality and entertainment value but still tended to be good ""waste of times""s at the very least,with probably The Wrath of Khan(1982),The Voyage Home(1986) and First Contact(1996,and probably the best of the bunch)as the strongest entries.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say,when I first heard about J.J.Abrams' attempting to ""re-boot"" the franchise,I had a certain mix of skepticism and hope. While I wanted to see the franchise return to the big screen,I held the minority opinion that the previous time-line of the show(stretching from Picard,Riker,Troi,Crusher,Data,Worf,et al)and that series of shows SHOULD be continued and not abandoned,so a ""retro"" or back story Trek film(pre-dating Kirk,Spock,McCoy,Uhura,Scotty,et al)was not--at least initially--something I really felt was in order. Over time(and what time,indeed:roughly two plus years from announcement of this film to release) I gradually softened to the idea of this film and was,by the time it released,VERY stoked to see it.<br/><br/>Overall,and after all that intro,I hacve to say that I was reasonably pleased,though maybe not as ""in love"" with this film as many(namely,film critics:it seems to average B+ grades from everyone from Rolling Stone to EW)but certainly not feeling the hate quite a few(mostly the seemingly 50 percent of commentators)have been showing.<br/><br/>The plot is neither a secret nor of any great urgency to tell,since it in fact might be the weakest element of this movie,but in a few sentences here it is: The new crew of freshly minted Starfleet grads are thrust into commandeering the Enterprise when their then Captain Pike(Bruce Greenwood)is kidnapped in a failed negotiation attempt. The new crew--a still new but disciplined Spock(Zachary Quinto,maybe the most compelling of the performances of the film),a harried assistant medical officer McCoy(Karl Urban,the Beefier DeForest Kelley,it appears),a ""brilliant"" communications junior officer named Uhura(Zoe Saldana)and,last but not least,a ""born-to-lead""baddass named Kirk(Chris Pine,who,I must say,actually DOES fills Bill Shatner's shoes pretty well)--are pitted in battle against a sullen,vicious Romulan named Nero(Eric Bana,under heavy make-up and barely recognizable)out to exact a vendetta against Spock. Okay,did I say a FEW sentences? <br/><br/>It would be pure hooey of me to say there wasn't a fair amount of plot machination here that made this movie,if not less palatable,certainly a long walk from excellent. The one example I'll give is the usage of time travel,which not only creates more than its shares of story knots but also threatens to make the back-story pretty mucky from here on out(maybe that's the job of the sequel--sequels--to come). One of the primary reasons, I'm pretty sure,for that aforementioned plot device was to bring Leonard Nimoy in as an older,wiser,more human Spock and,to that end,he doesn't disappoint,as he being the old pro and gravitas that this film full of many young,semi-familiar actors filling out very familiar roles.<br/><br/>Director J.J.Abrams may never be confused for a cinematic(or even television)genius,but if there's one thing he DOES know it's how to extract a right amount of visceral enjoyment and adrenaline out of a story(ask anyone who watches ""Lost"" on a regular basis;I dare say he did pretty good with an otherwise bloated and overwrought script for Mission:Impossible 3 also).A screenplay that tries to identify the familiar players from classic Trek may strike some as too facile,others as groan-inducing,it still is able to identify the players,put them into motion and make the franchise easy to identify and apply to a less-cheesy template and more 21st-century technological sensibility.<br/><br/>Flawed but entertaining,the franchise is doing two out of the three tenets of the famous Vulcan greeting/send-off. Maybe this re-boot will lead to better film entries into the series. It remains to be seen. This one gets a weak eight or very strong seven."

","As the director himself stated, doing a new version of Star Trek is fraught with land mines - there is a reasonably large fan base that cannot be alienated, and yet the film must have a fresh approach to to entice those outside the fan base.<br/><br/>In this regards, the film succeeds very, very well. In this movie, we have been introduced to legendary characters who we have pre-conceived notions, and yet the directors and producers have managed to break with the past by establishing a new timeline, as it were, in this Trek universe, thereby freeing this new series from the burdens of having to follow the old, classic series.<br/><br/>Sure, there are throw away references to the old series in a kind of, wink, wink, nudge, nudge way. For example, early in the film Kirk is making it with a green skinned alien - part of the somewhat humorous legend and lore of Kirk. We get the classic lines - Bone's classic ""Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a physicist"" returns. We are introduced to Capt. Pike, who is eventually confined to wheel chair after being horribly burned.<br/><br/>Still, this is not the Trek of old. Vulcan is destroyed, Spock's mom is killed. Roddenberry's approach was to present his Captians as cool, consummate professionals, which was (largely) followed by the original Kirk and Piccard. This Kirk is much more temperamental. Spock in the original series is shown as virtually without emotions (one exception - original series A'mok Time, when Spock seems positively overjoyed to see that Kirk is alive). Spock and Uhura seem to have a thing going one. There are some more obvious sexual innuendo comments going on. <br/><br/>Some minor quibbles. I had the feeling I saw Capt. Noah's Romulian ship somewhere else. The set didn't make sense to me - lot's of wasted space (from the acknowledgments at the end, I hazard a guess that much of it was filmed in a brewery somewheres). <br/><br/>I recommend it highly - it's not a 10/10, it's not meant to be. Still, although the film is NOT high art, it's a return to basic Trek - lots of adventure, lots of action, and relatively flat characters - Space Opera, pure and simple. I enjoyed it (and I am obviously a Trek fan), my wife enjoyed it (and she is not a huge Trek fan). So, go!"

","Having never been a Trekkie, I approached the latest in the long line of films and television shows with no real love for the genre. I was hoping that at least the special effects might be good; they generally are nowadays. With a story of some interest and intriguing cinematography there's little wonder that is a box office hit.<br/><br/>What we have for a plot is an almost bewildering blending of the past, the present and the future, all stitched together in a satisfying manner. But unlike the concurrently running ""Angels and Demons"", this plot is actually believable, even though this is science fiction. The difference is the pacing and ""Stat Trek"" has no trace of conspiracy; the enemy is well defined right from the beginning.<br/><br/>What is definitely fun is that we meet the main characters of the film early on in their formative years; James Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and even Dr. McCoy all reveal something of themselves. We now know a little more of how they came to be the crew of the Enterprise.<br/><br/>The effects are quite remarkable, and any fan of space adventures will be satisfied with them. There is a plot point involving time travel that is the only blemish on the narrative; this seems to be like the use of magic in movies. Contrive a difficult situation and have characters saved by supernatural imposition. The artful dodge of movie making.<br/><br/>This is probably the smartest of the summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>Three stars."

","Stardate 2009.05 Star Trek rocks into the 21st century.<br/><br/>First of all, let me state I'm not a trekkie. I grew up on the TV series, and liked it quite a bit, but previous attempts to project it onto the silver screen failed dismally in most cases in my view.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was because the early films insisted on maintaining the original actors, who were mostly past their sell by date by then. Nimoy and Kelley excluded. It was like trying to kick off Batman on the big screen with Adam West and Burt Ward. It was sadly comical and pathetic, if not impossible, to visualise a tough Enterprise crew with beer guts galore and grey hair.<br/><br/>Then in flies this gem, at warp speed, no less! <br/><br/>I do not want to comment on its plot at all, save to say that there IS a brilliant one, and a script to match it.<br/><br/>Neither will I say that this entry has taken special effects to another level. What it does do, however, is exploit today's CGI to the edge, making everything look so beautifully believable and tantalisingly thrilling.<br/><br/>I will, however, say something about the casting: flawless.

There's plenty of it, and supplied not only by a superb villain, space battles, and monsters, but there's conflict within and between the characters.

"TheUnseenMovieLover","9","2","10","24 May 2009"," The Blockbuster Is Back!
","I love the new Star Trek. It's riveting, vital, sexy, fun and surprisingly emotional. Simply put, this is blockbuster heaven.<br/><br/>This movie opens with a vicious attack by a mysterious Romulan (alien) ship, captioned by vengeful time-traveller Nero (Eric Bana), on Starfleet ship U.S.S. Kelvin. Just before he courageously pilots the Kelvin into the belly of the Romulan ship in an act of self-sacrifice, Captain George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) is able to help decide the name of his evacuated newborn child; Jim.<br/><br/>Several years later, James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) is an amazingly talented delinquent. After being brought to the attention of Starfleet Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) after a bar fight with Starfleet cadets, Kirk decides to join the Starfleet academy. Soon, he comes into conflict with the equally troubled Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto), who is struggling to come to terms with the fact that he has both Vulcan and human blood due to his mixed parentage. However, their rivalry will have to take a back seat if they are to stop Nero from taking his vengeance on actions that Spock takes in the future by destroying Federation planets, which include Spock's home planet Vulcan and our very own Earth <br/><br/>Everything in this movie clicks together to create an almost flawless ride of a movie. All of the cast and crew have created something fresh and exciting which not only pumps a ton of adrenaline into a flailing franchise, but also pays tribute to the show on which it is based. You've got the red-shirted crew member who meets a violent fate, a green-skinned girl who Kirk gets up close and personal with and quotes from the old TV series with a new spin on them. When Quinto delivers the infamous line ""Live long and prosper"", he makes it ooze with dislike. He may as well be giving the people who he's talking to the finger. This is one of the refreshing spins used on the Star Trek formula.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant without let-down. As Kirk, Chris Pine captures the essence of cool. He's relentlessly charming, quick with the one-liners, resourceful, reckless and good-looking enough to make many men (including me) jealous of his appeal to the ladies. Pine also pulls off the difficult trick of being arrogant without becoming grating. That is one of the signs of a star. However, he is still over-taken by Zachary Quinto's exquisite portrayal of Spock. Beautifully conveying the inner struggle between the character's Vulcan and human emotions, Quinto gives a performance of subtle intricacies which is a delight to watch.<br/><br/>The other cast members are all great fun to watch. Karl Urban is fantastically grumpy yet endearing as Dr. McCoy. Zoe Saldana gives communications specialist Uhura an unexpected strength and sensuality. Anton Yelchin is naively charming as 17-year-old Russian genius Chekov, and John Cho brings a dominating physicality and understated presence to helmsman Hikaru Sulu (to be honest, both Sulu and Chekov were slightly underused, but that's something which can be fixed in the inevitable sequel). Although he turns up late in the proceedings, Simon Pegg is sheer hilarity personified as engineer Scotty. Eric Bana is wickedly twisted yet somewhat sympathetic as the psychopathic Nero, whilst Bruce Greenwood is strong as the tough Captain Pike. Leonard Nimoy, the original Spock, also appears in a crucial role which he performs with great grace and dignity. Even the actors with only a few scenes, such as Ben Cross and Winona Ryder as Spock's parents, do wonderful jobs.<br/><br/>A film like this needs to get the action sequences and the visual effects right. Fortunately, both are handled inspirationally well in Star Trek. The first twelve minutes of the film are thunderous, creating a rollicking sequence in which the U.S.S. Kelvin comes into conflict with Nero's ship, the Narada. What makes this, and the other action sequences, so phenomenal is that we are drawn into the conflict of the characters in split seconds, intensifying the action even further. Another great sequence is when Kirk, Sulu and a red-shirted crew mate (oh dear) plunge from space towards a drill that Nero is using to destroy a planet. The plunge itself is stunningly executed, but it's the following fierce, hand-to-hand fight which really causes the blood to start pumping. Meanwhile, the visual effects are truly magnificent. When Kirk and the audience first see the U.S.S. Enterprise being constructed, it is a pure piece of movie magic which will have even non-fans grinning from ear to ear.<br/><br/>The man who's truly responsible for the resurrection of Star Trek is J.J. Abrams. From the very beginning, in which he wipes the slate clean for a fresh start with one simple yet ingenious move, Abrams brings endless energy and respect to his direction. It's also to his credit that this movie has a beating heart underneath the action and special effects, and that the narrative is actually unpredictable. It's great to be surprised by a blockbuster. The script also adds a new spark to the franchise. The writers have had previous experience with blockbuster movies (their previous credits include Transformers, which I actually enjoyed). The reason why the script delights is that it sticks to the blockbuster formula whilst deferring from it enough in order to stand out on its own.<br/><br/>Technically, the film's a colossal success. The sound effects are stunning, the score's suitably epic and the editing's tremendously snappy, brilliantly complimenting Abrams' ability to juggle both action and characters on the run.<br/><br/>Star Trek's a fantastic movie. Abrams has not only created a hulking piece of escapist entertainment, but he has also breathed new life into a franchise which faltered with the dismal Star Trek: Nemesis. This movie will make both Trekkies and non-fans cry with glee, and I hope that the cast and crew live long and prosper."

Zachary Quinto fits the bill as Mr Spock, Chris Pine is refreshing as Kirk and Simon Pegg is funny as Scotty. The other cast are also very good like Karl Urban as 'Bones' McCoy. Eric Bana is surprisingly good as the baddie, Nero. Defiantly the best blockbuster in years. So good that creator Gene Roddenberry would be proud. A great reboot with fresh faces and a familiar one, this new entry to the Star Trek franchise will live long and prosper."
"HelloTexas11","9","2","10","21 May 2009"," WAY better than I expected or hoped for
","Some hardcore Trekkies are not happy with the new movie, 'Star Trek.' But unless you're one of those who is immersed in the minutiae of the Trek 'canon' (as purists call it), chances are you'll find it exciting and involving. I am myself a long-time fan and I found it very faithful to the original series, admittedly in spirit more than every tiny detail. In any event, the makers of the new 'Star Trek' have given themselves a free pass by utilizing a time travel story which in effect creates an alternate universe and history of sorts, so that things aren't exactly as they once were anyway. But the characters are as we remember them, brought to life in greater detail than the original series allowed. Kirk in particular is fleshed out, made believable and three-dimensional as never before. A two-fisted hellraiser as a youth, he basically joins Star Fleet on a dare and continues to fly by the seat of his pants, fighting authority while at the same time becoming a leader. Spock is his opposite, and here he is portrayed as even more aloof and tortured than Leonard Nimoy's interpretation. He has quite a temper and does not suffer fools gladly... and at first he considers Kirk a major fool. At one point, while briefly Kirk's superior officer, Spock has Kirk thrown off the ship, literally. The two have many great encounters during the movie, arguments, discussions, fights and finally collaboration. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are fine as Kirk and Spock, respectively. Despite early press stories which indicated the actors would not imitate their predecessors in the various roles, that is exactly what appears to be happening. Certainly Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy seems to be channeling DeForest Kelley. And how else to explain Anton Yelchin's insanely absurd Russian accent as Pavel Chekov? All of the regular cast are 'copying,' to one extent or another, their counterparts in the original cast. And the great thing is, it works. Eric Bana as Nero is a serviceable villain, a crazed Romulan out for revenge against the future Spock (Leonard Nimoy in a good featured role thankfully, instead of a throwaway cameo) and then the entire Federation. The somewhat standard-issue plot is helped by a few surprises that might not sink in until after viewing the whole film. And Bruce Greenwood is excellent as Christopher Pike, first captain of the Enterprise. It would have been tempting to make him a cardboard character, someone to cast aside to make room for Kirk, but he's not- he's wise, resourceful, and committed, which makes him the perfect mentor for Kirk. Others worth noting include Simon Pegg, in a too-brief appearance as Scotty. He makes the most of his screen-time and has some of the funniest and most perfectly-timed lines of dialogue. Zoe Saldana makes a sultry Uhura, who apparently has the hots for Spock. Something tells me this will come up again in the inevitable sequel. The opening sequence, where Kirk is born during a vicious attack on his father's starship, has to rank as one of the most exciting scenes in all of Star Trek history, which as we all know, covers a lot of territory. And that's just the beginning. This year's 'Star Trek' is not only a strong candidate for best 'Trek' ever, it's also the best movie of the year, so far."

","First of all, I would like to start off by saying that many of the films I review for this site are not films that really have an everlasting effect on me, or for the most part would be films that I would watch again if they were on television, rent them at the video store, or public library, or buy them on video, or DVD. I live in a town with pretty much just one theatre that only caters to the people who like the big, loud and obnoxious Hollywood films that for the most part are a piece of garbage and a lot of the time I have no interest in seeing them. Often if a film gets good reviews I will go and see it to see what all the hype is about, but largely I have found that the critics nowadays have gotten a lot more conservative and tend to go for the non threatening and what I would call ""light entertainment"" films, rather than something with more substance, or artistic importance. The films with artistic importance and that are thought provoking and sometimes controversial, or with non linear story lines is the type of films I prefer and seeing as my theatre does not get them, I have to order them, or buy them when I am in bigger cities that do carry such good films. I have reviewed some very good art, foreign and independent films which I was able to see in bigger cities and put the reviews here. Films like Mister Lonely, Saraband and Vicky Cristina Barcelona are an example. With that in mind I am getting really tired of all of this Hollywood trash and yet I go see it anyways because like I said the critics now seem to go for them more than the independent, foreign and art films which is a real shame. I guess what I am trying to say with all this is, when I review a mainstream and very Hollywood type film such as Star Trek, even if I give it a moderate to really good review, please remember that I mostly rate these films as Hollywood films and they do not even compare to a lot of the films I would see in a bigger city or a university theatre that would cater more to my taste. I rate these films as Hollywood films. If they get a 9, or a 10 that means they are pretty good for a Hollywood film and if they get less than 8, you should forget about them. With all that said, now on to Star Trek. This version of Star Trek is a prequel to the 1966 television series created by Gene Roddenberry. I would not call myself a very knowledgeable, or loyal fan to the Star Trek series. I have seen some of the original episodes from the 60's and I enjoyed them as well as the animated series that followed a few years later. I have seen documentaries such as Trekkies, or some television specials about the Star Trek fan universe and just how loyal some of those fans are. That being said, I don't know how many of those fans would like this remake of the original series because the original series was quite philosophical and dealt with moral issues as well as science and I think this was one of the big attractions to many viewers. There was some action in the original series, but I at least, found it more thought provoking for a series of that time and genre than most other science fiction shows, or movies and that is probably why I could get into it more than the Star Wars franchise. Not knowing all that much about the Star Trek world, or past characters and story lines, I mostly review this film as mostly a newcomer to all of this. The film did have quite a bit of action in it, but I didn't feel it dominated the film and neither did the special effects, which I appreciated. The characters were developed quite well and the chemistry between them was well written I thought and the few yet minor scientific, or philosophical points I did enjoy, but there is not as much here as in the series. I mostly felt that the film had a good pace, it was entertaining and well written and structured for a film of this kind. I was overall impressed and liked it quite a bit for a Hollywood mainstream release (note: Hollywood mainstream release). I thought it was better than most other sci-fi action films of recently and if there was a sequel this is one case where I would be tempted to see it. Take in mind that I have heard some die hard fans were displeased with the film, but seeing as I do not know everything they know about the series and the ones that followed, I am rating it as a newcomer and what I saw I liked quite a bit."
"RAGEuvFire79","10","2","10","19 May 2009"," Perfect Movie. Not just for Star Trek fans.
","OK, first let me admit, I am not a huge Star Trek fan. I cant stand the originals, with there over acting. And Cant stand William Shatner, the king of over acting/ bad acting. However, I did enjoy TNG quite a bit. And I also enjoyed Deep Space Nine.<br/><br/>First things. For the few of you out there complaining about the characters,.... get over it. These are not supposed to be the same characters!!! The original series takes place after they were all grown and middle-aged, and have already been in space for awhile. This isn't those characters. This is a bunch of teenagers/ young adults, who are just getting out of the academy. A bunch of recruits who are just going to space and being assigned their duties. And without spoiling to much........... the plot twist in this movie explains that, due to what Spock did, those characters will probably never be the same as what they were originally destined to be. The future has been rewrote, in a sense.<br/><br/>Now as far as the movie. It was near perfect in my opinion. It was for anyone, not just Trek fans,... as long as you like science fiction. I thought that the characters, for the most part were perfectly cast. I loved Simon Pegg as Scotty. The visuals were very nice. The story wasn't perfect, but it was good. And the acting was solid. There was some cheesy lines in the movie, but they were forgivable for the fact that most were little catch phrases that the originals used to use.<br/><br/>I set through this movie, and never once was bored. And never once did I think of getting up to get a drink, go to bathroom, etc. And something else that is extremely rare for me...... I plan on going back and seeing it one more time, while it is still in the theater."

","Being a devout follower of the original series I was in HEAVEN. I am also an actress and the actors were spectacular at capturing the characters inner life (and uncannily most of them the look as well) and I couldn't have been more entertained with some of the original lines left in tact ""I'm a doctor not a physicist!"" and ""We're up to maximum warp - I don't know if it will take anymore!"" than if I had been a five year old at Disneyland. Please please please please bring Jim Kirk back to life from where he died (I was shocked and dismayed) in that series The Second Generation and put William Shatner into the storyline. Even though I am a woman, James T. Kirk has always been my standard in life (""I can't is not in my vocabulary."") and I unabashedly say that I am in love with a fictional character (and actually with William Shatner in his constant, brilliant re-making of himself). Kudos to the team and also a hat's off to Gene Roddenberry who wrote such great morality plays where good triumphs over evil. I will always be grateful. Live long and prosper.

","I have been a Star Trek fan since the very beginning of the original TV series. I have seen all of the TV shows, including all of the sequels, and all of the movies. I was a little leery about seeing this one because I didn't see how it could live up to the original series. Needless to say I was blown away. I loved everything about it except for one thing concerning Spock and Uhura. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie very much. The story and plot were interesting and the interaction and growth of the relationship between the characters was good. I especially liked Chris Pine's portrayal of Kirk. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, but Trekies will get the most enjoyment out of it and catching all the references to past Star Trek moments. Go see it - you won't be disappointed."
"Cedsi","10","2","10","17 May 2009"," Regarding some of the negative comments
","Well, first off, I thought it was a great movie. The acting was great, visual effects were great, it was a really well thought out movie.<br/><br/>However, one thing that's bothering me is this. I've seen many reviews of the movie blasting it because it doesn't exactly follow the Star Trek universe. ""Capt. Pike never became an Admiral, he retired a Fleet Commander!"" Others have pointed out how so-and-so never did this, how this person never did this. One thing that many people are forgetting though is this.<br/><br/>-SPOILER GOES HERE- When the Romulons(?) came through the black hole, they messed up the sequence of events. They completely changed the course of history. If they didn't, then you would already know the ending. ""Well, obviously all the main characters survive, because they go on to do other missions in the TV series."" But, by making it into an alternate reality, the main characters are no longer immortal. You don't know the fate of the crew, or of Pike. If you knew Pike was going to live and eventually retire as Fleet Commander, then it's obvious that by the end of the movie, Kirk and his crew will have saved his life, leaving no room to really do anything and no story to be told. What's the point of watching if you already know how it's going to turn out? By changing the flow of events, the ending becomes unpredictable, and therefore, it becomes new. So yes, it is possible for Pike to retire as an Admiral, and for Kirk to receive his commission as Captain differently than the original series told it. If not, then what's the point of telling the story?"
"woodswoman55","10","2","10","17 May 2009"," Terrific!
","Oh, I LOVED this movie! Before we went, I was concerned that Chris Pine wouldn't be up to the task of being a great Capt. Kirk, but I was wrong! I watched the original TV show back in the 60's and loved it then. The characterization in this movie of the original Enterprise crew was right on target. I did, however, think that Chekhov's accent was a bit too heavy - I had difficulty understanding him - but that is my only complaint, and subtitles on the DVD will take care of that! I'm probably one of the few who actually cried in the end of this movie. I can't wait until it comes out in DVD so I can watch it again and again and again! And I hope they have sequels!"
"skabrina","10","2","10","16 May 2009"," Roller-coaster of Excitement!!! Awesome installment!
","I had expected negative comments from this movie initially, when I first heard the production had started. I was thrilled to hear a new installment of the Star Trek franchise was being made. To hear marvelous comments from this movie itself drew me in even more to watch it. I had anticipated watching the movie all week, since it has been hectic, but sitting in that theater for over 2 hours is definitely WORTH doing since the movie was AWESOME!!! Non stop action every step of the way, although the plot itself is a little confusing while I watched the movie. I admit to wikipedia'ing the plot after I got home, but Chris Pine is an absolutely wonderful actor, and takes on the role of James Tiberius Kirk so well, and Zachary Quinto could not have been a more perfect choice for Spock. An excellent job from the supporting cast, and of course the lovely J.J. Abrams whose hard work pays off in this action packed ride-of-your-life movie. An AWESOME MOVIE WORTH SEEING AGAIN AND AGAIN (if you've got the time) and for the girls drooling over Chris Pine, he looks so good even when he is beat up. GO SEE IT!"
"PeterWorthers","10","2","10","16 May 2009"," Finally, being a Star Trek Geek is cool!
","I am an extremely devoted Trekker going on 30+ years now, I have seen every Trek series and all the movies so I have my opinion on what the best of the franchise is. And I have grown weary of the prequel theory (If it don't work right, go to the far beginning and start over and everything will be all better) believing that starting a series over will 'fix' or make a series more exciting does not work as proved time and time again. With everything in the Star Trek universe, all we've seen and all that has been done, how do you start over the greatest sci fi series ever and still stay true to the reason geeks like me fell in love with it oh so long ago? Easy - Star Trek - that's how. First off, it establishes that this story is set in an alternate time line (So this is just ONE of many many ways the classic series COULD have wound up and is going on in another reality) (I just gave myself a headache) All of which is explained in great detail by OUR Spock. Yes, time travel is the main plot in this as many of the other movies, and if you are a stickler for details, yes things are shaken up in the universe of Trek, but in a good way. Rodenberry wanted someone to come along one day and make his creation bigger and better. But at the same time it does not take itself seriously, joking all throughout and helping answer some long wondered questions about the show. But as with all things, i did find a few things to complain about, such as....<br/><br/>#1-All the events in the movie are sure helpful...""Oh, the planet is destroyed, thank God i can use this to travel back in time."" ""Oh they marooned me on a planet...Oh Spock and Scotty happen to be here...What a coincidence!""<br/><br/>#2-Whats the deal with Uhura? Her and Spock? Wow.<br/><br/>#3-Spock beams his family up to the Enterprise, and sees his mom fall and just stands there. He didn't try to catch her? Plus, why was she standing so close to the falling cliff side anyhow?<br/><br/>#4-So Nero goes back into time and waits for Spock. Hey guess what, you're in the past. Your planet is still there! YOU WIN! Go and save your people, not sit there waiting for revenge against events that will not happen.<br/><br/>#5-Whats the deal with Kirk and constantly hanging over cliffs? Someone put a rope around him or something.<br/><br/>But all in all, The same old Kirk, Bones and Spock - but new surprises that has even the most devoted of Trekker wanting more. With this 'new timeline' the possibilities are endless, the bar has been raised, lets see what's new in the Final Frontier....FINALLY - Being a nerd is cool."

I was a co-editor of a Star Trek fanzine and went to many, many conventions.I have a DVD of all the original TV shows and all the movies. I have met both Shatner and Nimoy in person and saw Nimoy in EQUUS on Broadway.<br/><br/>I have also seen the new movie twice already and I think it is perhaps the best one made (The Search for Kahn may be as good). All of the actors portray the characters believably and I, for one, would love to see a sequel, if not a new TV series starring the movie people"
"solomonmines","10","2","10","16 May 2009"," Star Trek (2009): A Grand-Slam Success
","Star Trek (2009) is an action-packed refreshing version of the classic franchise, not Trek canon, but this prequel does contain many of the core elements that have captured audiences for the past forty-three years. Good solid suspenseful story, superlative acting by the entire cast, excellent direction and the finest CGI special effects to ever hit the screen. Not so much a morality play as the original TV series, but more of a grand-slam richly-woven masterpiece of entertainment that keeps audiences riveted.<br/><br/>Even hard-line Trekkers have to experience that rare feeling of elation to see the young Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock side-by-side on the bridge of the Enterprise. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto give a great new dimension to the roles, and Leonard Nimoy (as always) is quite sensational in his portrayal of the elder Spock. Many fans of course miss seeing William Shatner and other original cast members recreate their roles and we'd like to see them all return. <br/><br/>Would be terrific if J.J. Abrams, Bryan Burk and Paramount Pictures cast Chris Pine, William Shatner et. al. in a different, but similarly appealing science fiction film based on the best-selling book Sunstroke by David Kagan, They would have to deal with a huge satellite--with a mind of its own-- that beams down power from the sun via microwaves, then is coerced to turn all life on Earth into crispy critters. Frightening and well-conceived.<br/><br/>In the meantime we're able to enjoy and appreciate Star Trek (2009) which provides a fresh new look at an exciting universe filled with unlimited promise for the future."
"jovidude24","10","2","10","15 May 2009"," Amazing movie even for non-trek fans
","I am a Sci-fi guy and have always been. Yet I have never seen a single star trek movie. I always thought that it wasn't for me, whoa boy was I wrong. One of the greatest films I have ever seen, hands-freakin-down. Any person will love this movie for it's action, comedy, suspense, drama, and even mystery. (well to some extent, and let me explain that) The way this movie is different than the original Star-Trek series is it's defining storyline. The characters in this film are meant to be very well read. I have been told that in the original series, things were left as a mystery. In this version, it was meant to be clear. However, as I said before, this movie has mystery. Although that statement pretty much goes against what I just said, it's true. The characters are very well read, however the storyline is very hidden and deep. Nothing is out in the open, you are meant to think while watching the film. One heck of a feat in my opinion.<br/><br/>The effects blew my mind away. The intense close-ups on the creatures, characters, and pretty much everything else in the film make this movie breath taking. These fight scenes are not only adrenaline pumping, but very surprising. There are very many twists and turns that will leave you thinking, ""Holy crap, what just happened?!"" Very much worth the watch for any non-trek fans and, obviously, for every trek fan."

","I'm an amateur writer, and for me, every sentence of your prose has to have meaning and interest (i.e. no padding). Now translate that to the movies, and in particular; this one.<br/><br/>The energy of this film is quite evident - something emotional/dramatic/plotinal (I made that word up) is always happening in this film - so if your attention span is short, then go and watch re-runs of ghost whisperer or something.<br/><br/>(Spoilers, sort of - Star Trek knowledge is a prerequisite) Now, we have 2 Kirk's, Captain Pike and 2 Spock's in this film - and if you are like me, you will look back to ""Enterprise"" and think time travel is a disaster. Thankfully, only 1 time incursion happens, and saves all the endless ""what if?"" balls you'll get if this was a series. It's also quite well explained. We do understand that reality from the 'normal' Star Trek universe (e.g DS9,Voyager) has been sent off on a tangent after a singular event - the (paradoxical) destruction of Vulcan.<br/><br/>(MAJOR spoilers - please watch movie before reading this unless you are so poor you must sustain yourself by sucking dew from rags - in which case, did you get my £50?, and how are you reading this?) So, Vulcan is destroyed? Only 10,000 Vulcan's left?! Vulcan colonies? Hmm.. It makes me wonder how cornered Vulcan's would react... But anyway...<br/><br/>Well, back to the film. I was wary of a new Star Trek film, but off the top of my head, Scottie, Kirk, Spock, Sulu and Uhura were all perfectly reinvented, and at least to me they all had an extra dimension added to their characters and they felt a lot more 'real' than the original series characters did. But then, the original series only lasted 3 seasons! Even 'Enterprise' out-did that! Maybe they are correcting a character building wrong.<br/><br/>I actually spent 3/4 of the movie telling my (wonderful & beautiful) wife about all the references to previous Star Trek movies/episodes - but had to stop when she threatened to impale me on a cinema hotdog. She also didn't know why Spock & Uhura being an item is unlikely. Bearing in mind that Kirk and Uhura had the first interracial kiss, I guess this is the first interracial-interspecies kiss. Another first for Trek! Since Americans feel obligated to acknowledge other nations, I was glad to see Scotty portrayed by Simon Pegg - I found him quite fitting (others not), and.. Um.. The Russian Guy (whose name I cannot bloody spell) was supreme, and must come back! (Please post his name and help make him famous) I also heard some rumblings that there were no Arabs on the crew of the Enterprise, but to be fair; it is set in the future.<br/><br/>(I'm going to burn for that one - Admin, please take that comment out if it causes offence!) Overall, I adored this movie, loved the new actors and new portrayals - and the only thing that could rain on this parade is the possibility that they won't follow through with more movies or a BG style mini series.<br/><br/>Way to go guys! P.S.<br/><br/>I've seen there is a cam version of this film on 'torrent' (i.e. Pirate bay and the like), but I would urge anyone to see this on the big screen first for quality of experience. And, if you have it in you to respect someone's work, at least buy it later on, because this is an excellent piece of work!

"dorkyj2002","9","2","10","14 May 2009"," Great for new & old generations!
","***Spoilers*** My group consisted of 4: 1 non-Trekkie, 1 Trekkie Cadet (I've seen a number of TOS, read some comics, and was pretty hooked on TNG & DS9) and 2 hardcore Trekkies. We all thought it was extraordinary; we were blown away. It was a perfect blend of a great sci-fi story & humor, as well as amazing effects and all but two strong actors. I thought that Eric Bana was a bit mild as the main villain. I had some mixed feelings about Uhara also. From what I've heard/remembered of Uhara, she was more of a lover and a fighter. In this, I just felt like she was too much of a lover. I know that sounds kinda crazy, especially from her first scene in the movie. But as soon as she hooked up with Spock, I felt her emotions jeopardized (I think I spelled that correctly?) her duties. Quinto kicked major you-know-what as Spock. He was perfect.<br/><br/>The other thing that really surprised me with this film- Chris Pine. The last I'd heard from him was in Princess Diaries 2. At first I thought to myself: 'What in the world? They're tarnishing this franchise even further.' But I truly believe he made this role his own. He was brilliant, steadfast, cocky, sensitive and was a great leader when the crew needed one. And even though Kirk is a fictional character, I really he was the definition of a leader. He knew when to follow protocol and when to go with his instincts. He knew when to push and he knew when to stand back. He knew when to let everybody be independent and learn things on their own.<br/><br/>So why did I give it a 9 out of 10? Nero and the whole Spock/Uhara pairing were just a little much. Mind you, it's not that I don't like the industry moving Star Trek into a new direction. I didn't even mind them making Spock more human than Vulcan. It just wasn't what I was used to. Not that I consider myself a fangirl of Star Trek- but Nimoy's Spock was very by-the-book and the closest he got to someone was friendship. I guess that's my biggest ""fangirl"" type of complaint.<br/><br/>Other than that, this was the best movie of 2009 so far IMO. Now we have to wait for Harry Potter 6 Lol :-P."
"ying8381","8","2","10","14 May 2009"," Fresh look and clever soundtrack!
","A fresh look with plenty of homages to the classics. I was also pleased to find that the songs ""Sabotage"" by the Beastie Boys and ""Bulldozer"" by Kongcrete were used tastefully in the movie, making tongue-in-cheek reference to factoids that only trekkies could appreciate. Several of the deathless ""Star Trek"" phrases are still in position here (""Beam me up!"" ""Set phasers to stun!""), along with winking nods to the original series' endearingly cheesy effects (the whirly ""transporter beam"" looks as silly as ever). And the writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (who previously collaborated with Abrams on ""Mission: Impossible III""), have come up with a head-achingly clever plot device that effectively vaporizes nearly 40 years of earlier ""Trek"" lore (six TV series and 10 previous movies), and takes the never-ending story back to square one, where it can begin spawning a fresh generation of sequels."
"David_Frames","7","2","10","14 May 2009"," It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
","The new Star Trek is all consuming - undercutting low expectations with a colourful landscape of rich visuals married with pace and driven by kinetic flair both in front of and behind the camera. Abram's Mission Impossible looked flat and felt static but Star Trek really moves with swooning camera movements, conspicuously eye catching composition and a degree of self-confidence that scoops you up and carries you along for that Hollywood Holy Grail – ""the ride"". There's artistry in its visual effects, an omission from most blockbusters, and the design is a combination of craft and graft, contrasting the smooth sheen of the Enterprise's bridge with her new boiler room bowels. Its future tech with a touch of real world grease and it speaks to the filmmakers intentions of partnering the geek aesthetic with something less esoteric for the unconverted. <br/><br/>Ironically for a movie that turns on future proofing legacies, the film's weakness is its story that feels slight and is driven by the commercial requirement to clear the decks for a new series of films – a deficiency that will become more apparent as time strips away its visual impact. Given that the script lacks any of the emotional or intellectual rigour that at least threatened to punctuate previous instalments, it does at least introduce a sense of fun and bravado that alludes to the best of the original series and it's more of a romp than before, signalling a new direction that owes as much to Star Wars, much apparent in the movie's dramatic thrust, as much to the series whose name it bears. <br/><br/>Goodwill notwithstanding, there are elements to this new approach that won't sit easily with aficionados of the Enterprise. The decision to wipe out 43 years of continuity, well conceived but poorly explained and embodied in a villain who is more plot device than character, is a poor return on a lifetime of devotion for hardcore fans – and the philosophical and moral implications of Nero's actions are given a cursory shrug in the interests of moving the story forward, a treatment which makes the decision seem flippant. The humour is sometimes too broad in a bid to appeal to an imaginary constituency of barely brain-stemmed teens, though it frequently recovers, and those on product placement watch will recoil with the news that both Nokia and Budweiser have made it to the 23rd century – a feat all the more remarkable on account of the nuclear war that occurs in Trek's chronology between our present and the time occupied by the libidinous Captain of the Enterprise. <br/><br/>Once the new cast settle into their familiar positions sometime during the final third, it feels natural and reassuringly familiar. Pine, retaining Shatner's cock sureness but dropping the melodramatic pauses, captures the spirit of his predecessor and is a worthy successor, though Orci and Kutzman could reward his performance by deepening his characterisation in the next instalment. Qunito's Spock is fine but lacks Nimoy's presence – how you miss the dulcet tones and Karl Urban's Doctor McCoy is perfect – instantly evocative of Deforrest Kelley without becoming an impersonation. True to the original series, the rest of the cast are little more than scenery, though the new Uhura is some of the best you'll see all year and certainly deserves more to do in future. Her sexually inspired turn adds a decent measure of human beauty to the gorgeous computer generated vistas. <br/><br/>A sensory treat it may be, visual effects and production design spit roasting your optics, but the impact is undermined by the absence of an equally inspired score. Great genre movies are defined by their musical dimension – imagine Star Wars without Williams, Blade Runner without Vangelis but the paucity of great compositions in recent years suggests that as the previous generation of great composers falls away, no one is coming up to replace them. A movie on this scale demanded symphonic support on an hysterical scale – something akin to Goldsmith's intervention in the otherwise lifeless 1979 film, but instead it's a generic score that substitutes volume for melodic coherence and memorable motifs. You've heard the like many times before and will be pushed to recall a note of it afterwards. The composers will claim that the trend is now toward so called 'emotional augmentation' – atmospheric scoring rather than out and out musical enrichment of the narrative, but this reduces what was once an integral part of these movies to clinical diagnostic support and it's unworthy of the potential of the movie score and the art form's heritage. <br/><br/>Exciting, inviting and a little bit frightening (the new Chekov's accent is as unsettling as any planetary destruction), Star Trek will polarise die-hards but have little trouble charming the uninitiated. It has scale, energy and a likable interplay between the leads, all of which go a long way toward apologising for some of the screenplay's less intelligible choices. Where it does succeed ultimately, is in evoking the spirit if not the intellectual curiosity of Rodenberry's series, and although we'll expect an extra dimension to the characters in the next instalment, there's enough optimism on display here to allow the filmmakers the benefit of the doubtthough just this once you understand."

","Awesome film. For both Trekkies and non Trekkies there's lots to like:<br/><br/>-Fanservice. There are some references to the old Trek and some answers to details that were left vague there.<br/><br/>-Casting. Simply splendid. Chris Pine should be considered a new star on the rise. Zachary Quinto was a very good pick for Spock and Karl Urban was instantly recognizable as McCoy, the other members did great as well with Simon Pegg as Scotty being the coolest.<br/><br/>-Special Effects. Not in itself reason enough to go see something but this film is a pure visual feast, both what you see in and outside of the Enterprise is pure Eyecandy.<br/><br/>-Story. Not as rock solid as the rest (see my spoiler post in the message board) but it was involving and the characters were given enough space and character to get to know them. Very well dosed with humor action and emotion, a terrific mix. Well done.<br/><br/>-Music. When you watch the trailer: awesome music score, somehow that tune was not featured in the film that much. Beastie Boys in the beginning seemed a little out of place but overall the soundtrack does not detract from the experience and enhances it when it should.<br/><br/>Simply two thumbs up who would have thought that? I was very skeptical when reading they would rehash Trek...but the way they did it was admirable. Go see this!"
"Sophski","9","2","10","13 May 2009"," Rollicking star trek fan pleaser
","The only reason it doesn't get 10 out of 10 is that this should be a part one of two - I want more. Kirk's early beginning is terrific and very in character. Chris Pine is fantastic and pleasingly not the perfect chisel jawed American hero - Kirk is flawed great stuff. Zachary Quinto as Spock is excellent and very reminiscent of the glory days when Star trek films were something to look forward to and to be impressed by. This is really something special. The whole cast works brilliantly well together. As each familiar character came into play I couldn't fault JJ Abrams choices. Leonard Nimoy is a wonderful mythic addition to an already great film. His turn as Spock gives the film a grounding in the science fiction hall of fame. This is definitely a film I will watch again and I can't wait to see the special features on the DVD. Definitely recommended for all serious science fiction fans. Enjoy!"
"docmav","9","2","10","13 May 2009"," Star Trek boldly goes
","Just seen the movie at the cinema and have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The tossed in references to the original series crews' mannerisms and quotes were great despite the fact that I have never watched the entire original series in order and so may not have picked up all the references. The only thing that did seem to jar for me was the intimacy that Uhura (Zoe Saldana was very good in the role mind you) shared with Spock. As far as I recall they didn't do that in the original series, but I could be wrong. I did read somewhere that Chekov annoyed someone but I felt he showed his characteristic exuberance. ""Bones"" gave a strong performance, Scotty was comedic as always and Kirk was fantastic (lucky blighter getting to fumble with Diora Baird, even if she was painted green at the time!) Zachary Quinto was compelling as Spock and the appearance of Leonard Nimoy added to the film too. Sulu was strong too even if he didn't feature so much, mind you the original show always seemed to focus on ""the three"" (Kirk, Spock and McCoy).<br/><br/>One of the best moments was the moment Kirk turned and struck his head on a beam, just as Scotty did in a film after saying ""I know this ship like the back of my hand!"", after the bedroom scene, of course!!!<br/><br/>Other reviewers have noted there are plot holes to some degree but this didn't weaken the film for me even though I understand and agree, in principle, with the points raised. It is for this reason I feel I have to deduct one point as there are some issues with the whole storyline but that said I still feel it was a solid film."
"mack27","9","2","10","12 May 2009"," A treat for the real fans
","This movie was non-stop action and you didn't have to be a fan to enjoy it. The most enjoyable parts for me were the nods to the fans. We get an Orion Slave Girl, classic McCoy one-liners, a view at young Spock's travails on Vulcan (the best stuff on that subject since the animated series) and we get Leonard Nimoy. The story wasn't all that impressive and we don't get any in-your-face ""Wow man, that concept blows my mind"" moments. The mind-blowing part is wondering how this same and yet different crew will handle all that is to come in this new universe.<br/><br/>The best nod to the fans for me, was making this a new universe. It means that everything you saw before isn't getting messed with. All those episodes you enjoyed? They happened, Ambassador Spock is proof. We've seen alternate realities in Star Trek before and we've also seen broken time-lines that needed to be fixed. Why this is an alternate reality rather than a broken time-line isn't clear, Spock could explain it, but it was clearly stated that this was an alternate reality. That means that this Kirk and the Kirk we knew could have separate dealings with the same mirror universe Kirk! Cool huh?"
"jazyjason","10","2","10","12 May 2009"," An excellent film and wonderful experience
","I went and saw this film on Thursday in IMAX. Essentially my friends and I went to see Trek with an open mind. With all the other box office flops and just sheer junk that's come into theaters over the past couple of years we were all skeptical at best.<br/><br/>However I must say that I was very blown away by this film. Me being 21 and not growing up with the original TOS series and being born right in between the making of TNG, I felt out of place sort of among all the die hard trek fans.<br/><br/>Needless to say I see a big variance in reviews among people. Either it's awesome and wonderful or in others opinions horrid. I understand why die hard fans may be frustrated but one must with all films keep an open mind to Abrams own take on Trek.<br/><br/>Basically, the film is very fast paced, in your face and just races and keeps up momentum very well. The acting I think was down very very well. Kirk was played very well, showing a brash young man who eventually we see develop into a bit of the kirk in the original TOS series.<br/><br/>Spock of course made me nervous. I'm sure we all feared the heroes acting return but surprisingly was down very well. And Bones just blew me away. The plot although shaky at times and a little bit of a stretch to contend with was workable and didn't phase me much.<br/><br/>The visuals were just gripping. The overall feeling of this film left me with a hunger to know more about Star Trek! I've never been into the series and now I'm hooked, going back onto CBS.com and watching the old TOS episodes and having an appreciation for this cultural icon.<br/><br/>Needless to say the film score was breathtaking and just grips every moment and is the icing on the cake. Bought the soundtrack loved it too.<br/><br/>In conclusion, from a newcomer to the series I don't understand the disappointment but maybe it's cause I'm new. But honestly if you can spend the money and see it in IMAX. Trust me it's mind blowing. One things for sure, is that Abrams has revived this series and has brought a lot of new people (including myself) into this wonderful universe. Can't wait for the sequel. Live long and prosper! ^_^"

","Went in to watch the movie on May 8, 2009 when it was released. Purchased tickets at 1pm for the next show at 3:55pm to make sure I could get in. Man was it worth it or what ? My kids an I loved the movie from start to finish. I loved all the characters except Uhuru's character. The new Kirk, Spock, Bones McCoy, Sulu, Chekov all were there in their new roles. The action was awesome. I really hope they can recover their 150 million in expenditure to produce more of Star Trek movies. Really hoping that they will continue Star Trek with new weekly serials. I would advise everyone to go and watch it in the movie theatres rather than waiting for the Blue Ray to come out."

","I'll be honest I'm no Star Trek fan. I mean I always looked at it as the weirdest show ever. But this film is incredible. The acting, special effects, characters, story all were spot on. It just blew me away. The story was more interesting to me, not for the plot but for how it changed the characters. Kirk is now a rebellious cocky character. Spock is changed from a seemingly uncaring(I know he's not, but I hear he originally bottled up all his emotions) to a more human man/vulcan. All because of the events of this movie(which I will not give away!) I've never seen the original show and the many movies, but because of this movie I am going to watch them. And isn't that what all this is about? I like the idea of seeing new adventures with this cast, because I truly like them. I'm very sure that this film will bring in many new fans, and it also opens up many possibilities for cool adventures. Anyway thats what I thought of the movie and I'm 17. I really never believed I would like Star Trek so much"
"TechHWright","10","2","10","11 May 2009"," This is not your fathers Star Trek. As stated before release.
","No, it was not another episode from the original series. Or, a prequel to that series. However, it was a great movie. Everything that happened in this movie, from the attack on the USS Kelvin right up to the credits, was not the old fans Star Trek. That event, at the beginning of the movie, changed all of the characters lives in some way. Technically, you could write a whole new time line worth or episodes/movies off of this new movie. In the end, most of the original characters came to be on the enterprise one way or another, but they all had some changes. Basically, if you wanted it to be a true prequel to the old series/movies. Well your out of luck. I personally hope they continue on with this time line. I think it was far more real than the original. Sorry old fans. Time to jump into the 21st, so to speak. lol Live long and prosper!"
"Spyder-4","6","2","10","11 May 2009"," Worth a look...especially if you're not already a Trekker
","The best job of casting they did in this movie was Karl Urban. He was more than convincing as Dr. McCoy. He had the mannerisms and delivery of classic ""Bones"" lines down pat. I found Zachary Quinto surprisingly adequate as Spock, though that is the best I can say for him. I found Chris Pine's Kirk very uninspired and Eric Bana's portrayal of the villain, Nero, surprisingly flat for an actor of his caliber. The only other bright spot amongst the cast was Simon Pegg as Scotty. While his screen time was severely lacking, when he was on screen he stole the spotlight with his masterfully delivered comedic lines.<br/><br/>While overall, I did enjoy the movie, I felt like the writing was horribly lazy. Using time travel to create a completely different timeline where any kind of continuity could be ignored is a slap in the face to all those writers that came before Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and established the wealth of material we consider the Star Trek mythos. For someone completely unfamiliar with the Star Trek franchise, this could be a very enjoyable diversion, but for those who are truly fans of the universe Gene Roddenberry envisioned, this movie is cheap gimmick to re-image Star Trek, much the way Battlestar Galactica was re-imaged, but without the quality of writing of which the latter benefited."
"rivertam26","10","2","10","8 May 2009"," Yes it's that amazing!
","I'm not a sci-fi geek. In fact my favorite sci-fi movie of all time is Serenity and closely following that is Gattaca and 12 Monkeys. I don't count myself as either a fan of Star Trek or Star wars I've enjoyed both franchises but none of them really drove me crazy. I entered Star Trek with high expectations though the trailers were awesome and the reviews have just been astounding. 95% positive last time I checked on Rotten Tomatoes.com. And let me tell I was no where near being disappointed. The film is incredible it's adrenaline fused mind blowing entertainment. Sort or a remake but not really the film follows the early years of the shows famous characters on their first battle mission. And it is exciting. The story is great, the direction from J.J. Abrams is near flawless the casting is exceptional except for a mediocre turn by Eric Bana as Nero. The spfx miraculous. The cinematography fantastic. The score goose bump inducin. And the film is well paced and very exciting. But lets get to the casting first. Chris Pine is handsome I don't think he's hot but his performance is endearing and he completely embraces the raw sexuality and cockiness of Captain Kirk. Zachary Quinto is perfect as Spock especially in the moments when his character breaks through his emotional guard. Zoe Saldana is also really darn good as Ahora I've never much liked or disliked her in other films but she is really at home here. John Cho working his way over from his comedic lead in the Harold and Kumar films is really impressive as Sulu. Simon Pegg is of course wonderful as Scotty although i wish there had been more of him, Anton Yelchin is incredible as Chekov and Karl urban is perfect as Bones. The film is funny and very well directed by J.J. Abrams which fuses tehf ilm with a sense of realism although what your seeing on screen is fictional. There is a fluidity in it and he keeps the emotional connection high so that you can really that whats happening on film is really happening. this movie is quite an experience I really have nothing negative to say about only that I saw it at 9:50 and the last show already went in. So I guess I'll have to wait tiltmrw to check it out again. P.s. there are even some welcome side performances from Ben Cross, Winona Ryder, Leonard Nimoy and Tyler Perry yes that Tyler Perry. Enjoy people this film has set the bar extremely high for summer movies and movies in genneral. The best movie of the year and one of my new favorites!"
"woodygoulart","10","2","10","10 May 2009"," Star Trek (2009) is Best of the Franchise
","Those of us who were teenagers when the original Star Trek premiered on television in 1966 should rightfully feel the deepest emotional connection to the franchise. What a person is attracted to during the important transition from youth to adulthood stays with you all your life. We experienced what is now known as the Star Trek phenomenon before it was called that. We were drawn to Star Trek in the 1960s somehow, some way despite the complete absence of viral marketing on the Internet, incessant commentary from fans and detractors alike in message boards, blogs, or using Twitter and Facebook.<br/><br/>We experienced the original Star Trek when it was new and when its powers were as yet unidentified and unstudied. I am am happy that I am from the huge baby boom generation that first approached Star Trek on a personal level when it was fresh and new at a time ahead of all the spinoffs and all the theatrical releases that followed. I am also happy that I chose to study the Star Trek phenomenon over the years.<br/><br/>I believe that the 2009 Star Trek movie is the best of the franchise. This movie features a young cast portraying characters that to my generation are indelible certainly because we have known them all and have spent countless hours with them over four decades. This movie has been the object of commentaries and criticism online since the news about this eleventh motion picture from Paramount first was announced. You can boil it all down to the one question that has been asked thousands of times over: How could anyone dare to remake Star Trek in the 21st century with a younger cast playing familiar characters? Just get over it. They did it. This one is the best of the bunch. Those who spend time in inane blogging about unimportant issues like which Captain Kirk is better need to get off the Internet and try to get a life."

It brings Star Trek officially into the 21st Century.<br/><br/>The movie:- 1. has a good fluid plot. 2. uses terms that most non-trekkies would understand. 3. has a good cast of young and skilled actors. 4. depicts a good changing over of guard from old to new. 5. has good bright lighting for sets on the Enterprize. 6. has updated to touchscreens, instead of knobs and switches. 7. has an overall good CGI throughout the movie. 8. has not destroyed the Enterprize.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Eric Bana has too little screen time. <br/><br/>Now where can I get that Warp Lever from the bridge?"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","10","10 May 2009"," The Hero Emerges in ""Star Trek""
","On planet Vulcan while preparing for the defining moment in young Spock's life, his mother Lady Amanda (loving Winona Ryder) tells her son (Zachary Quinto), ""Oh Spock, you will always have a proud mother."" That was Director J.J. Abrams's defining moment for me. His ""Star Trek"" is about the hero emerging from the love and legacy of family. Writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman create a classic story of the hero and destiny, with humor and great passion. They also have a reverence for what has come before, and the signature phrases of familiar iconic characters. Abrams, Orci, and Kurtzman may have altered the mythology for the better.<br/><br/>Orci and Kurtzman reinvent ""Star Trek"" as their own. The result is amazing storytelling. In the opening of ""Star Trek"", they choose to illustrate the childhood and young adulthood of James T. Kirk and Spock before they entered Starfleet Academy. Child Spock (good Jacob Kogan) awaits the taunts of his fellow students regarding his half human, half Vulcan pedigree. However, when one Vulcan kid basically calls his mother a whore, Spock beats the crap out of that student. Note that in the Vulcan Way: emotion is acknowledged and controlled by choosing logic. Picking up Spock from the ""principal's office"" his father Sarek (austere Ben Cross) implores his son, ""You will always be a child of two worlds, and fully capable of deciding your own destiny. The question you face is: Which path will you choose?"" After holding his own against 4 Starfleet cadets, Captain Christopher Pike (strong and commanding Bruce Greenwood) tells Jim Kirk (Chris Pine), ""Your father was Captain of a starship for 12 minutes. He saved 800 lives, including your Mother's, and yours. I dare you to do better."" Pike is straight with rebel Kirk. He has all makings of greatness, so when is he going to knock it off, and step up? ""Star Trek"" resonates in its story of the hero emerging.<br/><br/>The last element comes later with appearance of ""old"" Spock (great Leonard Nimoy), who plays an integral role in this narrative mythology. Here Nimoy provides gravitas as he advises Kirk (Pine) to reach out to his younger Spock (Quinto). Funny and ironically Pine points out to old Spock, ""We don't like each other. You hate me!"" Spock reminds Kirk that they both need a ""defining friend"". The hero is defined by his friend or rival. In this case his rival is Romulan Nero (darkly powerful Eric Bana), who apparently is from a future time frame, here to exact his revenge for the loss of a loved one. Bana is brilliant in illuminating Nero's intentions, but never enrolling us in his cause.<br/><br/>With the back drop filled, the relational dynamic is ready for warp drive as familiar characters enter the Academy and begin their careers. Karl Urban nails Dr. Leonard McCoy in persona and spirit. He even utters, ""I'm a doctor, not a physicist!"" Zoe Saldana is stunningly beautiful and amazing as Nyota Uhura, future communications officer. She is strong, and provides a surprising pivotal love interest. John Cho and Anton Yelchin are good as Hikaru Sulu and Anton Chekov, each have done their homework. Simon Pegg fortunately appears nearly half way through the movie as engineer Scotty. Pegg is wonderful, and provides the movie's more whimsical moments. He even says, ""I can't give her anymore, Captain!"" <br/><br/>Predictably, Nero's reign of terror calls the cadets to emergency action. The suspended cadet Kirk and Commander Spock serve with Captain Pike on the Starship Enterprise. The Enterprise looks great and the CGI effects are slick. Fortunately, Abrams focuses on character and plot. The space battles are impressive, but are secondary to the battle of wills of Kirk and Spock. At a narrative arc Spock commands Kirk, ""I will not allow you to lecture me!"" Kirk replies, ""Then why don't you stop me?"" Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto give star defining performances and define ""Star Trek"". Pine emerges as the handsome and rugged leading man, who has a light touch and surprising power. He owns Jim Kirk's brashness and raw courage, and is never caricature. Quinto is simply amazing as Spock. Not only does he look like a younger Spock, he provides a restrained edge and compassion. Quinto boldly captures a character struggling to hide his innate humanity.<br/><br/>Under J.J. Abrams's guidance and Orci and Kurtzman's amazing storytelling, ""Star Trek"" is one of the best movies of the year. ""Star Trek"" is the touching story of heroes, love, and family. ""Star Trek"" gets it right."

However, I thought the acting was superb and the storyline was pretty cool. I especially loved the actors they chose to play Kirk, Bones and Scotty, and the movie had the humor that you'd expect in a Star Trek movie.

It's fantastic, it ticks all the right boxes, they've got the balance right between the new and the old, kept the element of humour which was always there particularly with Kirk, but most importantly nailed all of the characters which was really what the original Star Trek was all about!. The makers of James Bond would do well to sign up Abrams for the next picture to restore Bond's key elements which they've ignorantly thrown away, and it also goes to show what Thunderbirds could have been if they'd stayed with the original values of the TV show and not turned Tracy Island into a kid's playground! The only let down was the last few seconds when you hear the iconic line ""Space... the Final Frontier, these are the voyages of the starship Enterprise...."" just at the point where everyone in the audience is speaking the last line ""to boldly go where no..."" they've changed it! the word ""man"" has gone and been replaced with ""no ONE has gone before""! So the wonderful glow that would have stayed for hours after I'd left the cinema was evaporated with the reality of politically correct earth in 2009! oh dear...what a shame. After going to all that trouble to capture all the essence of the original they didn't have the bottle to leave that most memorable tag line in its wonderful glory.

I have seen most of the movies but the only one I really enjoyed was Wrath of Khan. This one I enjoyed from beginning to end. The actors were not just going through the motions like most of the TV show actors did. These actors, although new to us, really put their heart and soul into it. They did not demean their roles by making them caricatures (which is what I was afraid of) but breathed new life into old characters.

But I'm here to offer a tone of comfort for those with reservations concerning a reinvention of this series.<br/><br/>As a Star Trek fan from nearly birth (78), I too was concerned about returning to the days of Kirk and Spock, and was somewhat skeptical about making the decision to do a prequel.<br/><br/>But! After watching the movie on opening night, and the day after... and the day after that... I think I can safely say that I'm sold.<br/><br/>Within the first ten minutes of this movie, I was moved to nearly tears as I watched the beginning of an epic adventure that would surely go down as one of this years best blockbusters... And no, it wasn't because I missed Star Trek ""that much,"" it was simply just ""that good.""<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams has not only managed to capture everything we all love about Star Trek, but he's managed to remind me of all the reasons I felt that way to begin with.<br/><br/>With a script that reinvents the series without discarding all of the films and shows that preceded this movie, I can safely say that if you're disappointed with this film, you need to take your bias out of the equation and try it again... Shatner is done, deal with it people, he had a great run... Time to evolve.<br/><br/>The script was wonderful... I found myself laughing at the dialog and events often as I watched a slew of familiar characters take shape in a wonderfully crafted universe.<br/><br/>The graphics were top notch...

"isabelle1955","Null","2","10","10 May 2009"," Terrific. Super. Wonderful. Great!
","OK, I'm a closet Trekkie, let's get that out of the way upfront. But you don't have to be one, to enjoy this movie. It's fast paced, well acted, exciting, beautifully made and perfectly cast. It's a good movie - Trek or not. It's not especially cerebral, but neither is it as dumb as most big budget action flicks, and importantly for those of us who have watched every version of Star Trek over 40 years, it does stick to the spirit of the original show, bringing humanity and humour to space.<br/><br/>Watching this origins episode (tagline The Future Begins Here) of the ongoing Star Trek story (and calling it a mere franchise just doesn't do it justice. It's a part of our cultural heritage) something occurred to me yet again, something that I often felt while watching the TV shows. The reason Star Trek works, is because it's about people. It's not about space flight, or science fiction or digital trickery or aliens or warps in the fabric of the space-time continuum or fabulous special effects, although those are all there in abundance. It's about people. As Kirk famously said in an earlier iteration of the Star Trek story (and I'm paraphrasing) ""I'm from Iowa. I just work in space."" This story just happens to be set in space but what it's about is Spock, Kirk, Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu and the anonymous ensign who always dies early. It's about the humour and the interactions, the relationships and the characters that have seeped into our consciousness over the decades. And it had me hooked by the end of the excellent opening sequence.<br/><br/>The story traces the early days of the crew of the USS Enterprise, as they pass through Starfleet Academy and take their place in the ranks of Starfleet officers. It explains the background of Kirk and Spock, and follows them and their colleagues as they must work through their differences to save earth from destruction (well what else would it be about?) Others will explicate the detail of the story, which involves the Romulans as enemies of the Federation, enemies who are seeking vengeance in the past for the destruction of their home planet at some future date, allowing their bad guys to travel back in time to confront Spock, Kirk et al. and the fabric of space time to be thoroughly upset. I think.....<br/><br/>But what I'd really like to emphasize is the excellence of the casting which is truly inspired, the tightness of the script and the perfection of the effects which do EXACTLY what special effects should do – namely enhance the story telling, not drown it. I thought each and every actor was perfect in the part, but special mention must go to Zachary Quinto who is just superb as a young Spock wrestling with his human-Vulcan biracial origins. He looks uncannily like a young Leonard Nimoy but he is also a nuanced actor. Chris Pine as Kirk actually looks less like William Shatner (as compared to Qunito/Nimoy) but has the character to a 'T' without in any way just being an impersonation. Zoe Saldana as Uhuru was super and her flirtation with Spock was an unexpected but welcome aside to the main story, they brought a real sensuality to their scenes. Simon Pegg and Karl Urban were also perfect. I found Sulu perhaps the least believable of all the characters but that's a minor criticism. Chekov was perhaps a little too puppy-like, but nonetheless endearing. <br/><br/>My only one slightly negative comment might be that this is very much a Boys Own story. Uhuru was of course the only significant woman on the original show back in the 60s, but we've gotten used to seeing the girlies take a bigger role in The Next Generation and the various other spin offs. It seemed strange in a prominent movie about the future, to see the women taking such a small role. And Scotty's fluffy friend was a bit unnecessary and reminded me too much of an Ewok. But apart from that - great! I'll buy the DVD. (Sad eh?)"
"moviesleuth2","7","2","10","9 May 2009"," A solid ""reboot"" of the iconic franchise
","To say that ""Star Trek"" is a cult phenomenon is an understatement of galactical proportions (ha ha, this time the pun is intended!). The fans of the famous series are the butt of jokes from every fabric of our culture (not only do they have a collective name, Trekkies, but TWO documentaries about them!). Their only rival in fan fever that they have is ""Star Wars,"" though I think many of them belong to both parties.<br/><br/>For a long time now, old TV shows have been resurrected on the big screen. Not quite a remake, but a new ""version"". But ever since the massive success of Christopher Nolan's new vision of the ""Batman"" franchise, the term ""reboot"" is the correct lingo. So how does J. J. Abram's ""reboot"" of the ""Star Trek"" franchise measure up? Well, it's not Nolan's re-envisioning, although to compare any ""reboot"" to those films is unfair to just about any movie. Abram's film is a solid start to an inevitable franchise.<br/><br/>Oh, there are flaws. Most of them are little things, like music carrying over when it shouldn't, mildly awkward cuts, and the like. But there are three BIG problems, which I will get to later.<br/><br/>This is an ""origin"" story, and it feels like one. What makes this different is that it tells one story with one villain, as opposed to propelling the development of the characters through episodic chunks. This direction runs the risk of rushing the development or not adequately doing so, but ""Star Trek"" avoids doing this.<br/><br/>James Tiberius Kirk is a rebellious young man who has accepted his lot in a life of meaningless existence. However, he is challenged by a Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to join up with the space fleet. Of course, Kirk does this, but he seems more concerned with pursuing women than really working hard. This puts him at odds with Spock (Zachary Quinto), whose Vulcan side makes him a strict adherer to rules and protocol. Nevertheless, they are eventually put together on the U. S. S. Enterprise when they run into a nasty Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana), who has a nasty habit of turning planets into black holes. Now, Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew have to save Pike (who was captured by Nero) and defeat Nero while not getting destroyed (or destroying each other, in the case of Kirk and Spock) in the process.<br/><br/>This is very long winded, but it's relatively straightforward. At least until they insert time-travel into the story. Normally the sci-fi mumbo-jumbo is just frosting on the cake. Not here; it's an intergral part of the story, and I spent a frustrated 10 minutes trying to figure it out.<br/><br/>The performances are where ""Star Trek"" really shines, and that's probably the most important part of the film. In order to sustain a franchise (which ""Star Trek"" will undoubtedly become, given the fact that every movie that makes even a dollar more than its cost gets at least two sequels), we have to like the characters and they have to be able to hold the audience's attention. Abram's cast does this, in a way that's actually better than expected.<br/><br/>Everyone gives it their all. Chris Pine is great as the rebellious, somewhat cocky role as Kirk. He's a guy you can root for. The main characters in movies are typically the most grounded, and therefore the least interesting. But Pine injects Kirk with enough personality that he's never dull. Zachary Quinto steals the movie as Spock. He turns what is a one-dimensional character (a rule-abiding nerd) into a fully three-dimensional character. While Kirk may be the ""hero"" of the movie, it's Spock that we really feel for. Qunito ably conveys Spock's internal conflict between his emotionless-Vulcan side, and his human side, which is anything but. Quinto, of ""Heroes"" and ""24"" fame (neither of which I have seen), is an actor to watch. Eric Bana is completely unrecognizable as Nero; he's vicious and a more than worthy adversary to the Enterprise crew, but he's not going to go replace science-fiction's most iconic villain, Darth Vader. Other actors, including Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, and in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo, Winona Ryder, dive into their roles just as fully. Leonard Nimoy brings a wise presence in what is much more than glorified cameo.<br/><br/>Apart from the time-travel confusion, there are other problems. ""Star Trek"" gets off to a bad start. The problem is that it immediately dives into the story. While there's certainly no crime in getting to the meat of the story quickly, it is essential to have at least some development with the characters. Given the way it turns out, it's not such a big problem here, but even spending a minute or two with the characters would have made it more effective.<br/><br/>The second is the lack of character development. Apart from Kirk, Spock, and to an extent, Nero, no one is even remotely fleshed out. But with a cast this big, it's probably unfair to expect more than the film gives. I guess we'll have to wait for future installments to get to know the secondary characters more.<br/><br/>Is ""Star Trek"" worth seeing? I liked it. Will the most die-hard fans like it? Not being one myself, I can't say. But I'd say they should give it a shot (if they haven't already). Will it turn me into a Trekkie? Doubtful; I'm not running to Best Buy to buy every season of every show, though I might watch it when it's on TV. Best of all, it's a much needed antidote to the superhero movies, which I have long since tired of.<br/><br/>Note: I saw this at 10:15 on the second day of its release. The theater was dark, but from what I could see, there didn't appear to be anyone dressed up as one of the characters. Make of that what you will."
"galahad58-1","8","2","10","9 May 2009"," Enterprising
","I was very hesitant to go and see the new Star Trek movie. Since I enjoy the original series (and the movies) a great deal, I did not want to watch J.J. Abrams destroy the reputation of the franchise. Why make a movie with Kirk, Spock and McCoy? What not make Star Trek with different characters? I was pleasantly surprised. Star Trek has beautiful special effects. Star Trek is eye-candy in warp speed and well worth watching just for the effects. The script was average, but it worked to get the movie going. There is no depth to the story and you will not be reminded of past stories by Gene Rodenberry. There is no morality setting, nor a great chance for character definition. It is a two hour movie and the script must account for Kirk getting command of the Enterprise and the seven main stars (Sulu, Checkov, Scott, Uhura, Spock and Kirk) to be together.<br/><br/>At first, Star Trek faithful will be thinking ""this is not what happened in Kirk's life""---etc. It is later that the audience finds out why things are different than in the past days of Star Trek. It is an interesting concept--one that allows for a new franchise to be built without trying to keep the structure of the old series and movies. Now there is a clean slate where any story can be conceived and plotted.<br/><br/>Acting will not stun you in the movie. Karl Urban and Simon Pegg stand out a great deal. You can see where each one of them took something from the original character and introduced it into their performance. Zachary Quinto is very good as Spock and he looks like a younger Leonard Nimoy. Chris Pine takes nothing from Shatner and it shows. He is decent as Kirk, but not great. Pine is the one flaw (and not a serious one) in the movie. He has the cockiness of James T. Kirk and some of the swagger---but he does not have the screen presence and he does not have that ""inspiring"" command attitude that would make any military man follow Kirk into battle. The rest of the cast are alright. There is more screen time for Uhura and Sulu than in the series. It was a bit silly to have the fake Russian accent for Checkov though--that could have been avoided. Bruce Greenwood is good as Pike (he is always good) and Eric Bana is fantastic as Nero. The acting is not stellar, but it plays well to what was allowed. It also opens the door to deeper relationships in future movies.<br/><br/>I would recommend Star Trek. It is not better than the original, but it is a nice homage to the series."

","Well, what can I say? After months of waiting, I saw the new Star Trek film last night and I don't know if I can do it justice with words. Whether you're a fan of the franchise or not, this film is incredible.<br/><br/>It's a tour de force that doesn't let up, from the opening scenes to the finale. This is a fast-paced ride packed with action, humour, emotion and strong characters. Star Trek is back, and it means business.<br/><br/>There will be those who complain that this film moves too far from what Star Trek is all about. I disagree. I feel this film moves closer to Star Trek's original intentions. This is a film about finding your place in the world, and overcoming perceived disadvantages, and about accepting that you do not need to prove yourself to anyone other than yourself. This film is much more in keeping with The Original Series, and thankfully sheds the horrible technobabble that would overwhelm the likes of Voyager and Enterprise.<br/><br/>There are some nice touches and nods to the original show, with the characters uttering immortal phrases and the grace and design of the Enterprise bringing the original beautiful design up to date.<br/><br/>As far as direction goes, there were a few moments of glare on the lens that I presume were deliberate and they made a few scenes seem a tad overwhelmed with light, but otherwise it was easy on the eyes. The action sequences are beautiful and you have a sense of the epic when you watch them.<br/><br/>One tiny criticism- the musical score didn't work for me. They were wide of the mark with that- but that is just my opinion and others might find it fits.<br/><br/>As Nero says in the trailer, the wait is over- Star Trek has reclaimed it's place as one of sci-fi's leading lights."

","I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Great to see Star Trek back on the big screen. I knew this was going to a good movie and I wasn't disappointed. J.J Abrams knows how to make a movie. And this definitely lives up to the hype we've all been hearing about in the last couple of weeks. Not so much of story really, but there are great special effects and good performances from the actors involved. Out of the performances, there were two who stuck out in mind during and after the movie. Simon Pegg as Scotty and Chris Pine as Kirk. Simon Pegg was hilarious as Scotty and Pine was great bringing his own style, swagger and humour to the role, instead of trying to impersonate William Shatner as Captain Kirk. All in all a great movie to watch on the big screen and one that stays faithful and adds new life into the Star Trek franchise."
"EijnarAmadeus","8","2","10","9 May 2009"," Breathing new life into the difficult science fiction genre.
","J.J. Abrams enters the cockpit full of belief and faith in this year's ultimate re-franchising of the enormously popular TV-series 'Star Trek' - and in the hands of Abrams it becomes the most spectacular science fiction film since 'Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith' - and now in 2009 it outdoes it in fantastic special effects and Abrams outdoes Lucas in rethinking the science fiction genre. He refills the tank with smart casting (two fresh-faced, talented lead performers and a load of interesting supporting acts by Simon Pegg, Eric Bana and John Cho to mention a few), character-driven humor and a vivid imagination in good Abrams spirit that sweeps the screen with brilliant set-pieces and a story that's true to the Star Trek-heart and is in the same time easily fed to Star Trek newbies. It's in many ways the same challenge that Zack Snyder and his 'Watchmen' had to face when creating a film for the old-school fans but in the same time appealing to a fresh audience - the biggest difference is that 'Star Trek' is such an immediate hit right off the opening scene, it's an easier and better watch.<br/><br/>Abrams kickstarts the film with effective introductions of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), handling the human textures with a slick ease (as we've seen him do so brilliantly on ABC's 'Lost') before boosting us into space where the heart of the film forms brilliantly. He manages the visual effects better than most (Michael Bay and his gang in Transformers will have a hard task surpassing this) as he captures the three-dimensional layers and intertwine live action and CGI remaining the essence of realism and spectacular excitement. 'Star Trek' deserves to be this year's biggest blockbuster, and let's hope that everyone stays around for the second installment that's inevitable to come."
"tchockythegreat","8","2","10","9 May 2009"," Letter-perfect casting saves a hit-and-miss plot line
","Prior to his death, Gene Roddenberry said that he hoped that someday someone would come along and redo Star Trek, making it bigger and better. Almost two decades after his death, Roddenberry's hopes have mostly been fulfilled by director J.J. Abrams (T.V.'s Alias & Lost, Mission Impossible III), who has laid a mostly solid foundation for a more modern take on the swashbuckling space opera.<br/><br/>By far the best thing Abrams' update has going for it is its virtually flawless casting choices. Each actor does his or her part in making their respective roles their own while paying a considerable amount of homage to the original cast. While most critics have reserved the majority of their praise (and rightfully so) for Chris Pine's rebel-with-a-heart-of-gold Kirk and Zachary Quinto's slow-simmering yet cerebral Spock, Anton Yelchin's Chekov and Simon Pegg's Scotty deserve an equal amount of praise. Both are equal parts hilarious and effective; Yelchin as a plucky recruit whom people can hardly understand thanks to his hammed-up Russian accent, and Pegg as a slightly-off-his-rocker Scotty. Zoe Saldana's Uhura is sassy and fun, and Karl Urban brings a quirky, ticking-time-bomb-of-insanity touch to Dr. McCoy. John Cho's Sulu is the only true weak link of the updated cast, but that is mainly due to his character being given little to do other than get in a sword fight and screw up a warp jump. As for the supporting cast, everyone performs admirably, with Leonard Nimoy's return as an elderly Spock carrying some unexpected, and effective, dramatic punch.<br/><br/>The cast is so outstanding as a whole, it is easy to overlook the movie's flaws, which can mainly be found in its storyline. Despite Eric Bana's performance as the villainous Nero being solid, it is hard for the viewer to totally accept his motives behind his quest for vengeance against the Federation because the premise behind his hatred is rather silly, coming off almost as an afterthought when his motives are finally revealed. The tension between Quinto's Spock and Pine's Kirk is also a bit hit-and-miss, ranging from believable to poorly thought-out (to avoid posting spoilers for those who haven't seen it, I won't delineate what happens in this review).<br/><br/>Despite the movie's flaws, it does lay out some impressive groundwork for a new generation of Star Trek fans. Fans familiar with Abrams' work know that the man knows how to film action sequences, and the amped-up outer-space action in the film is gloriously realized and a joy to watch. Most of the interactions between the cast are terrific, with some hilarious humor that almost never detracts from the movie. Thanks to by far the biggest budget of any Star Trek movie, the effects and sets are, as expected, properly grandiose and stunning.<br/><br/>While not the near-flawless hunk of summer popcorn that 2008's The Dark Knight was, this film is nevertheless a promising start to what I hope will become a successful reboot of a classic science fiction saga.<br/><br/>Memo to George Lucas: THIS is how you update an old sci-fi franchise."
"ajpublic","8","2","10","8 May 2009"," Great Reboot - a job well done by all!
","For me, Star Trek was always about Kirk, Spock and the rest. I used to watch episodes of the Original series at midnight when I was in High School. However, I never got into the other several series, and if I had to choose one other it would be The Next Generation.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am pleased that the writers and director decided to bring back the original characters and storyline for a new age and a new era of movie entertainment. This version of Star Trek has great characters, chemistry, and enough of a story to keep anyone watching engaged from start to finish. The plot works well to pay homage to the original series, and still gives the viewer a path to see the new universe and how the two intertwine. The special effects were fantastic, and it was the subtle changes that really impressed me, like the bursts of phaser fire instead of solid beams or the addition of swirls for the transporter instead of the static that was previously used. The acting here is superb. Pine as Kirk nails the role, giving that Kirk swagger just enough kick. Quinto shines as Spock, with a nuanced approach that both reminds the fans of Nimoy's Spock and also provides Quinto's vision as well. Saldana as Uhura has a strong role, having much more influence within the ship, than in the past. Urban's McCoy was great, Chekov was great, Scotty was great, Sulu, etc.. Honestly, the casting team for the film deserves a great deal of credit, for bringing the right mix of actors together. Bana especially brings a menacing, calculated angle to his role as Nero, and his use of accent and speech patterns were impressive. <br/><br/>Overall the movie succeeds well in introducing to a new and re-introducing to an old generation to the stories and characters, and ideas that have been intriguing people for over 40 years. I am very excited to see what they have in store for the 2nd and 3rd films with this cast, I think it will be enjoyable to watch them and their adventures for the next decade."
"Moviefanguy","Null","2","10","8 May 2009"," Why this is my favorite Star Trek
","I just got back from seeing Star Trek with my 11 year old son. We both loved it! I am old enough to have watched every episode of TOS during its original run from day 1 and count myself as a fan, though I don't go around wearing a Starfleet uniform or pretending that I am a Klingon. <br/><br/>This is a fine reboot. Since it's Star Trek, and reality was changed, the inconsistencies in the film aren't really inconsistencies, just things that were changed by the Romulans altering the time line.<br/><br/>So here's my take on this movie; 1)Spock and Uhura being involved was surprising and a bit jarring, but getting hot for Zoe Saldana would be....logical. 2)Kirk has the tendency to be choked. They did that too many times. 3)Kirk has the tendency to hang from high places like the Coyote from Road Runner cartoons. They also did that too many times. 4)Romulans all look like Michael Stipe from REM, and have his disposition. 5)That hand held camera thing really makes me nauseous at times. They should have left that to The Blair Witch Project. 6)The actors playing Spock, Scotty, Checkov ,and McCoy managed to do the somewhat iconic speech patterns of the original cast without it seeming like a Saturday Night Live parody, though it was funny when the director intended. This was used to break the action up and it kept the movie from becoming too intense. 7)The actor playing Kirk wisely did not attempt to do the speech patterns of Shatner, which was good. It's hard to do Shatner without it being a parody. 8)Winona Ryder as Spock's mom was really unusual casting but worked fine. Didn't realize it was her. 9) Nero must have changed the time line so much that a giant deep canyon formed in Iowa, which is mostly flat with some rolling hills in our time line. 10) In this alternate time line Kirk does not know or has not yet learned that flying drop kick move that took every alien society, no matter how advanced, by surprise.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film that will satisfy those who are not Trek fans as well as those who are."
"nfxstudios","8","2","10","8 May 2009"," Exactly What Star Trek Needed
","Sometime around the midpoint of Star Trek, the characters stand on the bridge of the Enterprise discussing the implications of living in an alternate universe, and what their lives might have been like had Captain Nero and the Narada not interfered with the timeline.<br/><br/>The inside knowledge of the characters gives them the intelligence to understand that this is not how things are supposed to be, but that (with the advice of the elder Spock), maybe things are destined to work out a certain way in any eventuality.<br/><br/>But for all of this ingenuity in setting the stage, Star Trek still has to tell a dramatic story, and it mostly succeeds in doing so.<br/><br/>Nero and Ambassador Spock have been catapulted back in time roughly 100 years, after succeeding in stopping a massive supernova, but failing to save Nero's home planet Romulus from destruction. That's the extent of the understanding required of the time travel plot. The rest is motivated purely by revenge by the grief-maddened Nero, and it's interesting that Nero is in many ways a sympathetic – although completely psychotic – villain. He's not evil. He's insane. A working man who's family was destroyed by a mistake he interprets as apathy or conspiracy.<br/><br/>Gene Roddenberry's original intentions for Star Trek – for Captain April of the USS Yorktown in the late 1950s to early 1960s – was an adventure show with a moral or allegorical undertone that could be exciting, believable enough from a science standpoint, but most of all, entertaining. Roddenberry felt that if it wasn't important for Joe Friday to explain how his revolver worked on Dragnet, it shouldn't be important for Captain April to explain how his phaser worked; its function should be evident in the way the characters reacted to it. In that respect, prevalence of the technology was less important that telling a story about believable characters in an exciting adventure with some kind of subtext.<br/><br/>This Star Trek is light on the allegory, but the subtext remains in spades.<br/><br/>Most affected are James Kirk and Spock, who's lives are irrevocably changed by Nero's actions.<br/><br/>In this reality, Kirk's father is killed in the moment of Kirk's birth, and instead of an upwardly mobile young man, we see a rebel with the duality of being the genius and leader he was born to be. An undisciplined, cocky miscreant with the swagger and mental ability of a great commander. The conflict and contrast here provides a meaningful portrait of someone struggling against destiny, and moreso than with any other character, studies the theories of nature vs nurture. ""James T. Kirk was a great man, but that was another life,"" Nero suggests at one point in the film, but by the third act we see the shiftless and reckless rebel maturing into the Captain Kirk he was perhaps destined to become by any means.<br/><br/>Opposite Kirk is Spock. Spock's struggles are initially internal, a fight to reconcile the two halves of his physiology – the emotional, passionate human, and the logical, stoic Vulcan. Spock's conflict becomes external when his home planet Vulcan is destroyed by Nero, his species of people wiped out, and his mother killed. How Spock comes to terms with his conflicts is as central to the story as Kirk's.<br/><br/>And then there's adventure, which there is certainly plenty of, thanks to state of the art and expertly executed practical and CGI effects. Perhaps as importantly, the action sequences are well framed and well paced, so the film never feels so fast you can't keep up, nor so confusing you can't tell who's doing what. This is not an easy thing to accomplish, even for a veteran director.<br/><br/>Not everything is perfect, however. Some of the camera work, while inventive, can be disorienting, specifically some of the spiraling shots in the opening sequence. These don't detract from understanding of the flow of action, but come across as pretentiously gimmicky. Likewise, bright camera flares are often overused, especially on the bridge of the Enterprise.<br/><br/>Despite the abundance of Vulcan characters, there are also leaps of logic. Most notable of these is the sequence where Kirk and Scotty are beamed from Delta Vega to the Enterprise, which is at warp. Assuming the transporter has some sort of finite range (otherwise, one would not need a starship at all), and that the Enterprise is moving away at billions of miles per second, the feat doesn't seem to be in targeting such a fast moving object (as is portrayed), but instead a feat of long-distance beaming. If we can transport billions of miles, why do we need the starship we're beaming to? Likewise, the meeting of Kirk, Elder Spock, and Scotty on Delta Vega comes across as entirely coincidental, and at quite a stretch of the imagination. I suppose one could invoke destiny, but I don't think I buy it.<br/><br/>In the end, Star Trek seems to spend more time building back stories than it does working on its own present story, and the meat of the central drama might sometimes take a back seat to explaining who's who and why. That's not to say there isn't drama – good drama – just that there often isn't enough of it.<br/><br/>What we're left with here is an essential origin story to set up a new franchise – a franchise that, by all appearances, honors the philosophy of Gene Roddenberry and the characterizations and chemistry of his crew of the starship Enterprise, while not being afraid to try new things. This is a very good example of science fiction action and drama that relies more on characters and pacing than it does on meaningless technical explanations. A very emotional – if not cerebral – entry in the Star Trek mythos that does Gene Roddenberry proud and paves the way for better adventures to come."

","I am a huge fan of Star Trek and I would recommend this movie highly to fans and non-fans alike. Ironically I did not grow up as a fan but instead discovered the Original Series and the Next Generation at the end of high school and in college about six years ago. I was intrigued by how both series dealt with profound ethical and philosophical questions in an entertaining, albeit lovably cheesy, fashion. That being said I like the Original Series the best and am fascinated by JJ Abrams new vision for the series.<br/><br/>The performances are spot on and all of the actors (especially Chris Pine, Zach Quinto, and Karl Urban) pay tribute to their characters without overdoing it. Eric Bana is wonderful as Nero, a nemesis that hearkens back to the genius and ferocity of Ricardo Montalban's Khan Noonien Singh. The special effects are also worth a mention as they serve to engross you completely in the Star Trek experience. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie, marveling at the incredible action.<br/><br/>I can praise the movie until I get carpal tunnel, but I think it is important to address some aspects of this film, mainly the continuity and science. First off, speaking as a person who values scientific accuracy in movies, this movie is not scientifically accurate. The black hole nonsense I can excuse, but the ""red matter"" aspect is ridiculous. Just take it for what it is though and you will have fun. Another aspect of this film that is especially interesting is that it is not necessarily a prequel since, through the course of the movie, history is changed, and thus, so is the future. Time travel plays a huge role in this film and just because it takes place some years before the Original Series doesn't mean it is a prequel to the events. The time travel is in fact a very interesting and mind boggling plot element that is pulled off nicely even if all of the puzzle pieces don't fit together exactly (i.e. Nero is waiting in Vulcan space for twenty-odd years and no one finds him until Starfleet goes to Vulcan). Thus, history is altered in a pretty significant way. But these deviations from the Original Series are more fun and thought-provoking than they are annoying.<br/><br/>That being said, GO OUT AND SEE THIS FILM! you will love it! I promise!"

","I figure that plenty of negative reviews have been posted, so I'll try to refrain from any negative remarks as much as possible. For those of you who have never seen a Star Trek episode or movie, you are in for a cinematic treat. For those of you who have a passing familiarity or are intimately familiar with every series and movie turned out, this is not and I emphasize NOT a walk down memory lane. For those fans this movie is filled with all sorts of anachronisms or things that don't belong that really shocked me. Aside from the overall redesign of the Enterprise which I'm not too crazy about, engineering looks like an industrial complex (you'll see what I'm talking about when you see it for yourself). I find that I rather enjoyed the film even though certain critical elements were changed for the better or for the worse I cannot decide yet. Never-the-less, I would encourage you dear reader to go see this film with an open mind. Don't go expecting to see a nostalgic rendition of an old classic but simply an original work of cinematic art."
"inyourimage","8","2","10","8 May 2009"," First half better than the second, but overall great!
","The cast is great! All the right people in the right parts. The first half was particularly inspiring for me. There were a number of exhilarating sequences. I am very particular about special effects, so most of the issues I had were there. Not the quality of realism, but the cinematic design. For instance, the Romulan vessel looked like one of those weird hair things that nobody knows exactly what it is for. And I didn't even know that the Romulans were Romulans until they said it. They really weren't anything much different than the Klingons. I remember Romulans being like Nazi or maybe even ancient Ramses-style Egyptian-like Vulcans - rigid, imperialistic and refined...that's how they should be. I think they could have done a much better job on the Orion slave girl. She looked like a bimbo painted green. They definitely switch things up a bit in terms of roles and relationships. Basically, I think they used the whole temporal thing to really, like someone else said, ""reboot"" everything in the Star Trek Universe. I could get knit-picky about little things, but I won't. The end seemed a bit anti-climactic to me. But I guess it was fine. My favorite quotes from the movie were Sarek telling Spock, ""What is necessary is never unwise,"" and Bones telling Kirk, ""A little suffering is good for the soul."" If I were to have made the movie, I would have made it more like say Full Metal Jacket, where the first half was in the Academy and the second half was in action. They kind of did that, but I think they could have really put a lot more attention into Kirk and the others training at the academy. Its a short jump between Kirk in a bar fight and Kirk diving out of a shuttle screaming through the atmosphere to land on a tiny platform thousands of feet in the air. I would have liked to have seen maybe Spock and others drilling cadets in different venues, where they could have really made it fun and funny (like the astronauts in 'The Right Stuff')."
"villanwilson87","10","2","10","8 May 2009"," The Finest Star Trek/Prequel!
","This rebirth of another seemingly over-dragged franchise is not only the best Star Trek out of the eleven films, but ranks as the most outstanding prequel of all time. Like many critics and film fans as myself, I yawned at yet another remake into a film franchise that was past its sell by date, until I watched this film because it is without a doubt a fantastic, mind-blowing film experience.<br/><br/>Full credit must obviously go to J.J. Abrams who has finally established himself as one of the most promising and gifted directors in Hollywood today. After creating Lost and Cloverfield, there was clear talent from this director, (who also directed the brilliant Mission Impossible 3) and its clear here that he took note of other successful previous prequel's, e.g. Batman Begins & Casino Royale.<br/><br/>To all those who weren't particular fans or just too young to remember (myself being nearly forced to watch certain episodes and previous films thanks to my father's massive fan base), will no doubt be aware of its popularity, and only appealing to those who enjoy science-fiction, but the movie ticks all the right boxes in regards to some of the most unforgettable special effects/action sequences, e.g. space attacks, planets sucked into black holes, chases, monstrous aliens (Abrams who is no stranger to this, thanks to his Cloverfield creation).<br/><br/>The film although at two hours, moves at a terrific pace, with a typical script of good versus evil, with Eric Bana (Chopper, Munich) portraying a brilliant and yet unrecognisable role as the bad guy leader of the 'Romulan Nero Empire,' bent on taking revenge due to the destruction of his planet by blowing up first the Vulcan planet, and then Earth.<br/><br/>The script feels fresh as it goes back to basics with how all the famous members of the Starship Enterprise crew becoming who they are by joining the Starfleet Academy, e.g. Captain Kirk (played brilliantly by an unknown Chris Pine), Commander Spock (a touching performance by Zachary Quinto, showing barely any typical emotion as a half human/Vulcan), Simon Pegg as chief engineer Scotty (with a witty and yet typical funny character, and reasonable Scottish accent), Karl Urban captures the determination and loyalty of Medical Officer Leonard 'Bones' McCoy, and the very attractive Zoe Saldana as Lieutenant Uhura (another unknown, but this picture will launch her career).<br/><br/>Good cameos as well by Winona Ryder (playing Spock's mother) and the legendary Leonard Nimoy as an 'older' version of Spock.<br/><br/>The film is not just a science fiction film, there's funny sequences involving Kirk having an allergic reaction which causes him to have 'BIG' hands at one point, and even emotional scenes where both Spock and Kirk encountering one another's feelings that escalates.<br/><br/>Some people will say it's cheesy and predictable, but I loved every minute of it, and was never bored, that should appeal to all people a-like, and one that I would highly recommend.<br/><br/>Boldly bring on the next picture that will be very tough to beat but can be done, e.g. The Dark Knight went one better than Batman Begins! An exhilarating and brilliant entertainment picture."
"poofta1970","6","2","10","8 May 2009"," Just as illogical as Star Trek has always been
","I was really hoping for a major rebirth here and sadly it's pretty much ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" the remake (with a bit of ""Enterprise"" thrown in for good measure) and I haven't prejudged this film.<br/><br/>This film was designed to be a way of resetting the original characters so we can get new tales about them without having to worry about the huge mass on continuity (not that it bothered many Trek writers in the past anyway).<br/><br/>Time travel is rarely done well and here it makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>If this is a model of time travel where there is one universe which is changed by time travel without paradoxes the solution was simple. Instead of worrying about Earth young Spock should take his mega fast space ship from the future straight to the problematic star and sort it out before it ever becomes a problem. Romulus is saved, Nero will then never go back in time and everything will be back to normal.<br/><br/>If this is a model of the universe where time travel changes nothing but navigates people from one alternate universe to another, while it's a terrible shame that Spock and Kirk don't get on, they aren't the same people as the other Kirk and Spock so the Leonard Spock should be more concerned with getting the pertinent information to this version the crew so they can remove the threat to this alternate Earth than making sure his younger other self's friendship with Kirk get's back on track in the universe he now finds himself in.<br/><br/>Instead we seem to have a hybrid of the two. With Kirk being the Captain of the Enterprise and Spock being his friend and science officer being key to some future (so much so that Leonard's Spock is willing to gamble the fate of whole worlds on making sure this happens)but where Vulcan, Romulus (not to mention Amanda and Kirk's family) can not be saved (for reasons not explained).<br/><br/>Most the changes that Trek obsessives seem to be niggled by can be explained by the film but this major plot conceit can not.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't provide a tight enough mechanism to accomplish what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>The worst Star Trek stories follow a pattern, a cosmic whatnot causes a chain of events which threatens a large group of characters (usually the Earth or the Federation) which can only be solved by a fist fight and male bonding.<br/><br/>This is one of those stories.<br/><br/>The acting was great in places (terrible in others), the effects wonderful but the story makes no logical sense and that impacts on how much emotional investment you can put into it.<br/><br/>It's essentially the same film as ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (itself a virtual remake of ""The Wrath Of Khan"" and seen by some as final nail in the coffin of Trek as it was).<br/><br/>The only thing that's seems to have changed is the general mood of the cinema going public.<br/><br/>So as a rebirth it's as successful and as much a failure as the rebirth of Doctor Who (the new stories are just as bad as the ones that were aired when that show was cancelled).<br/><br/>It's back but everything that made it go wrong before has come back with it but the bulk of the audience are so obsessed with bright colours and loud noises that they don't really notice (it will make a lot of money but that doesn't make it a great film).<br/><br/>Ironically the only Star Trek film to get close to exploration side of the Star Trek mission statement was ""The Motion Picture"" which is a vastly superior film to this one and largely dismissed by Trek fans and casual viewers as being sterile (and even that had a cosmic whatnot which was halted by a degree of male bonding, only the fisticuffs were verbal in nature in 1979).<br/><br/>This film is missed opportunity to do something truly radical with the Star Trek idea.<br/><br/>Hopefully if sequels happen the crew of this Enterprise will get back to exploring the universe and forget about trying to blow things up and jumping around and smacking people in the chops."
"waltvalt7","9","2","10","7 May 2009"," When do they start filming the next movie!!
","This is the best sci-fi/action movie I've seen in forever. The action is as close to non stop as you can get and still have a plot. I thought the plot was intricate enough to force you to pay attention but it didn't feel like you were studying for a test trying to keep up with things. I really appreciated the way that they were able to link the new actors to the characters that we grew to love so well over the years. In some ways it was like how the old Warner Brothers cartoons used to be, but instead of kid jokes and adult jokes there were new to Star Trek moments and moments that seemed very inside if you know what you were watching on the original Star Trek. I sure hope J.J. was confident enough in what he was doing to get multiple film contracts with all the principal actors. I feel like I have a reason to be excited to see the next Star Trek film for the first time in forever."
"super16","6","2","10","7 May 2009"," Good Popcorn Entertainment
","This is a very well made and sufficiently well-conceived film that it is disappointing that its downfalls (which only come to you in retrospect) are actually as large as they are. <br/><br/>It's a very enjoyable film - most casual moviegoers will come in and leave feeling like their money was spent well. However, anyone who wants a well rounded film experience, including a great plot, won't necessarily feel that way. And while many of the hard core fans will accept the (SPOILERS start here) alternate reality/time traveling story line, the writers took a very easy way out with these plot devices - it is something which has been done in any number of sci-fi franchise (perhaps with the lone exception of the Star Wars movies) from Star Gate to Star Trek, the plot reminded me of a combination of several episodes of Voyager (""Relativity"" and, more particularly, ""Year of Hell""). The other problem with the movie is the choices they made, both involving the same character - the destruction of his home world and his relationship with a fellow crew member. <br/><br/>Another complaint I have with the movie is some of the cast. While good actors, Cho and Seldana do nothing with their parts as Sulu and Uhura. On the other hand, Urban is very good as McCoy and Quinto is an adequate (albeit more illogical than necessary) Spock, but both Pegg's very brief, late entry as Mr. Scott and particularly Anton Yelchin excellent Chekov. Pine does a very good job of making a very well known pop icon his own. On the other hand, one of the essentially problems with the film is why Kirk gets the full on hero worship at the end when it was Chekov and Scott who made the success of the trip possible and Spock himself who saved Planet Earth. Another failure in the script is that Uhura and Sulu really had nothing (and did nothing) to contribute. It's also a very charming, witty script although someone who is only a casual audience member or even a sometime fan will not get some of the in-jokes. <br/><br/>The high grade is for the fact that the movie is a very good form of entertainment and hopefully some of these issues will be resolved in the already planned sequels. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt in the hopes they will try harder in the plot."
"sillybuddha","6","2","10","7 May 2009"," Exciting but Forgettable
","Star Trek – no subtitle, no number, and a new beginning for a film and television series long gone out of fashion. Yet an appropriate subtitle would be Star Trek: The Ride, for this slam-bang summer actioner is a breathless thrill, although with little to say about science, ethics or any of the familiar subjects Trek is occasionally admired for.<br/><br/>For all the hype surrounding a bold new direction, Trek XI feels surprisingly familiar. Almost straight away we are given backstory about how this film ties into the others, and the villains (the Romulans) are the same enemies seen in the last Trek movie, Star Trek: Nemesis. However, Trek XI fairly shoehorns in the audience expectations, whether it's in dialogue: 'Dammit Jim! I'm a Doctor not a...' or 'I'm giving her all she's got!' 'Phasers on stun' to Kirk womanising and Spock doing a nerve-pinch and mind meld. So the film wants to be fresh, while keeping the branding.<br/><br/>The real changes appear to be in the camera-work, with direction dizzyingly fast and disorienting, portraying the internal mayhem of a starship under attack more effectively than any previous Trek film. To be fair to previous Trek movies, they haven't had the same amount of money thrown at them, and, while visually impressive, the use of re-dressed industrial locations to represent the bowels of various ships is a misfire (you never get the feeling that you are looking at the ship's engine - it's all a mess of pipes). The steel and concrete of these 'real-world' sets instantly drags the viewer out of a futuristic-looking world and into a rather cheap-looking one.<br/><br/>The film is also noticeably more violent than any previous Trek film, and, sadly for a future without money, product placement creeps into Trek for the first time in its history.<br/><br/>The film goes at full-tilt nearly all the time, and if you stop to think about the absurd meetings and convenient plot-developments, the edifice crumbles slightly.<br/><br/>One unfair criticism of the Trek series that were set in the 24th century (TNG, DS9, VOY) is that they were too soapy, too interested in the minutiae of the character's lives and not as interested in 'big ideas' like the Original Series. In this regard Trek XI has more in common with Picard, Janeway and Sisko as Kirk fails to lecture any aliens about the importance of freedom and democracy, but does spend time emoting about his dead father. <br/><br/>Yet Kirk's backstory is never explored. OK so he lost his father, but why does that mean he goes off the rails? Why is he hanging around shipyards if he hates Starfleet so much? Would one little jibe from a Captain reverse years of rebellion? The film moves so fast you can't even consider these questions. More focus on the origin story would have been welcome.<br/><br/>Plot holes abound - if Spock went back in time, why is Kirk being born on a starship? The official Star Trek website says he was born in Riverside, Iowa. Will Riverside be taking down its 'future birthplace' signs now? And Scotty-s 'transwarp beaming' - if you can beam anywhere, why the hell do you need starships? The plot falls apart after a cursory inspection. And why was Kirk promoted in a ship full of presumably better-experienced candidates? <br/><br/>Spock's romance with Uhura is also given no background or explanation and seems an instant-mix attempt to connect the audience to Spock and show him as more than the cold, unfeeling logic-monster he is. Yet other characters are given short shrift in the internal motivation stakes. Scotty is used as a comic foil, and Pegg's 'Scottish' accent is occasionally distracting as is the 'Wussian' - although Yelchin does his best at making Chekhov eccentrically charming. Sulu has almost nothing to do character-wise, so no change there then. The biggest disappointment is Bones McCoy, who never gets to have a heart-to-heart advice scene with 'Jim' - this film is a buddy movie and the third spoke in the TOS wheel is largely left out.<br/><br/>What also stuck in my craw was the 'execution' of Nero. So the dastardly Romulan refused help, fair enough, but why then phaser him into oblivion? Wasn't being sucked into a black hole enough? Spock's lack of mercy for Nero at this point was also troubling. Nero may have been willing to fight to the end, but what about his crew? I thought Kirk didn't believe in the no-win? Well a real win would have been the capturing of prisoners. Still, at least we see that baddies torture and goodies don't in Trek XI.<br/><br/>Fundamentally the film is exciting, and that is probably the 'Prime Directive' of this reboot. Will it convert a new generation of Trekkies? Maybe, but what will they then watch because of this new interest?<br/><br/>Any of the old TV series will be lacking the bells and whistles of the new film and seem hopelessly dull in comparison – if taken at surface value. While a successful Trek film is to be celebrated, Trek is at its best on the small screen, where it can explore issues in more depth. There just isn't any depth to the new Trek, it is indeed style over substance.<br/><br/>While there is nothing wrong with a stylish, fluffy Trek being at the cinema *if* a thoughtful Trek runs alongside it on TV, in this new 'timeline' there is now only one Trek, and it is a big cinematic confection of light and sound, signifying little.<br/><br/>So yes, I enjoyed Trek XI, but for me, Trek is really about TV and how this massive film will translate into a decent TV series is unknown.<br/><br/>Best Trek film ever? No. For me that honour still goes to 'Moby Dick in Space': Star Trek First Contact."

","I got back from midnight screening in Aus and have to say both myself and my wife enjoyed the film. She is more a trekky than i but we both agreed on points that we disliked. Firstly the casting of Simon Pegg as Scott - its not that he does a bad job or anything it's just that he's, well, Shaun of the Dead... After going so well with casting unknowns for all the other major parts (a major coup as they are all excellent and quickly become believable as their counterparts) casting Simon kind of destroyed the illusion. I am well over shaky, close up, quick edit action scenes. It plain hurts to watch them espec on the imax screen we were at. Maybe on smaller screens it won't grate so much. Any movie with time travel involved is always on shaky ground. It asks a lot and makes plot lines hard to comprehend on occasions. Oh and ""Red Matter"" - seriously.. If your going to have a black hole creating liquid - give it a mofo scary name. Nexomortium or something or other.. Red Matter pah! <br/><br/>But i do recommend the film to all fans of the original series - you will see just how well the unknowns have digested the source material and created believable younger versions of Spock, Bones, Kirk.. but sadly not Scotty"

","In short: Did I like it? Oh, yes. Did I love it? Doubleplus yes. Reboot? Well... it does not ignore the events of the 700+ episodes and 10 other movies. Instead, we get a time travel story which changes the *whole* timeline. Original Series continuity? Gone. The Next Generation? Gone. Deep Space 9? Gone. Voyager… gone too. I frown at the thought that the only thing that seems unaffected is Enterprise which never lived up to its premise till season 4. As an avid fan, effectively erasing that much continuity to evade the words “reboot” is, well, a tad bit too much. As much as I hate reboots, I wish it was one. Nero was an OK villain. I would have definitely liked to see more of him on screen. He got a Star-Trek style explanation of his motives (which is: he is not just an evil megalomaniac genocidal creep), but we never really got to know him better, he remains too much in the back. I little more interaction with him would have served the movie better, because apart from his back story which takes up about one minute in the movie, he is never really more than your generic genocidal maniac. He doesn’t seem to have any doubts about his goals, any reflection on himself. Pity. The Vulcans are much, much more emotional than ever before, and this includes Spock (well, that’s one case I can understand) it just doesn’t really feel well with me, supposing we are talking about the same Vulcan from TOS. The characters are all likable (well, we know them already, don’t we?), the acting is generally solid, and the humor never fails short. The pacing is fast, but good, and you never start pinching in your seat. The effects are also very well done. I still don’t like the all-too sterile Enterprise bridge, or neither the redesigned ship itself. She just doesn’t seem to have good proportions in my eyes. The one from the TOS movies looks better any day (or for that matter, the 1960’s one too…) Verdict: 8/10"

It seems that going back to the roots is a formula to success (Batman, James Bond,). This movie contains so much action that a non SciFi fan will stay in his seat to watch this one out. The visual effects are stunning, this is no surprise in a SciFi movie, but what's more, it has a very good plot. A nice story line that doesn't seem to far-fetched.

The film moves quickly and even if you don't know the original series you'll still be able to understand it. If you DO remember the original you'll get a kick (as I did) out of some of the lines being used in the movie that come RIGHT out of the series. The acting is fairly good. Pine didn't impress me too much as Kirk. He comes across as shallow and kind of obnoxious. Quinto, on the other hand, was very good as Spock. Bana is given nothing to do as Nero but sneer at the screen and yell. Bruce Greenwood is excellent as Pike--the first commander of the Enterprise. Also Zoe Saldana makes a seriously sexy Uhara. Everybody else is pretty good also. The plot is kind of vague on some points but the movie moves so quickly you ignore them. This HAS to be seen on a big screen also.

","I usually sneer at the term ""reboot"" in terms of movies or TV shows. Usually. This time, however, it truly is a reboot and it is magnificent. I loved this movie. (saw it twice, so far). Whether you're familiar with the old TV show or any of other TV and screen incarnations or someone who's never seen any of the above, you can thoroughly enjoy the characters and plot. It's a bonus if you're familiar with the old TV series since there are some inside jokes and sparingly used more famous quotes. I think it's clever how they use alternate reality because of the change it causes in the time line. If not for Nero's actions, James Kirk wouldn't have lost his father and become such a handful. This movie gives the satisfaction of seeing the crew of the Enterprise come together in different way. The casting is superb. Chris Pine is a great Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock is genius. The way he played Spock as a complicated man. He keeps his logical self out front, but you can see the passion and feelings boiling just beneath the surface. Each and every actor in each and every part were so perfectly cast. This movie has a plot. An actual, honest plot. Each scene fits seamlessly with the next one. The story builds and there's a satisfying ending. Everything comes around full circle and things are as they should be. The crew of the Enterprise are all together and I can't wait to see what adventures are in store. Surely there will be sequels. There's just so much to love about this movie. The excellent screenplay that provides interesting dialogues.....The wonderful casting and acting involved. There was enough excitement and battles to be satisfied without being overwhelmed by endless explosions. Leonard Nimoy's pivotal part was very good. I loved seeing him as the older Spock. I absolutely recommend this movie. It's very enjoyable and fun, too. Even if you swear you don't like Sci Fi stuff, watch it...I think you'll enjoy it."

","It's difficult to find all the superlatives to describe this latest in the long, stored history of Star Trek films, but let's try, shall we? Awesome - simply awesome. There we go. I feel better now. I was and am completely blown away by this movie and I haven't really been blown away by any movie, let alone a Star Trek movie, in a long while.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams has not so much reinvented the Star Trek series as he has brought completely new and, in my opinion, quite amazing creative energy into a series that has long been in the doldrums. You know Star Trek is in a funk when there are movies in the series that you haven't even heard of and least of all care about (ST: Nemesis, anyone?).<br/><br/>Everything - well, almost everything - is completely new: Actors, design, feel, ships - everything is fresh and new and every note perfect, brilliant, and wonderful. There are no lost moments, no missed cues, no wasted screen time. Abrams is pitch-perfect here.<br/><br/>The most revealing thing to me about his style is that he is very good at creating both character and story. If you were to compare him and Michael Bay, for example - both have a really solid sense of action and style - but whereas Bay feels more like a schlock auteur with a $200 million budget - Abrams creates relatable and interesting characters AND fantastic action with the same budget.<br/><br/>Will the same crowd that saw ""Star Trek"" go to see ""Transformers 2?"" Of course. Big Robots and Megan Fox - what's not to like? - but the contrasts in film-making style and depth will become all the more obvious once we see them both. The ""Transformers"" series is great in the sense that is fun and Bay definitely has command of the editing and crowd-pleasing action and effects - but, all that said, his depth is limited. Ultimately his chosen stories feel somewhat weightless and silly.<br/><br/>Chris Pine as James T. Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock are the linchpins of this movie and possibly the new series as it literally takes flight. Zoe Saldana as Uhuru, Karl Urban as Bones, Simon Pegg as Scotty (perfect!), Anton Yelchin as Chekhov (also perfect!) - man, they're all really, really great and Abrams is clearly pushing great performances out of all the actors here. But Pine and Quinto are the keys here - just very, very good and confident as they make these legendary characters their own.<br/><br/>Let me not fail to mention Eric Bana as the rebel Romulan Captain Nero - frankly I did not even recognize him (not terribly hard given the makeup) - who was also very, very good. He really chewed the role up well.<br/><br/>Much as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the benchmark of the Star Wars series, the benchmark of the Star Trek movies is without exception considered to be ""The Wrath of Khan"" but Abrams may have one-upped that series classic (series sentimentalists notwithstanding). In relative terms one feels the weight of Ricardo Montalban's and William Shatner's tendency to melodrama more contrasted with the acting that is as good, but more subtle in this new Star Trek. Pine's Kirk is very much his own man - and let's be honest it takes a LOT to put the weight of Shatner's Kirk on your shoulders - but I like his style and abilities here. He has all the swagger and self-confidence that is needed to take on the role of James Tiberius Kirk.<br/><br/>The difficulty here I suppose will be how does one maintain the quality of the series now that it has been officially ""rebooted?"" That will be the challenging part as I'm sure eventually Abrams will step away from helming new movies. How does one prevent a certain degree of boredom with the characters, the stories, the world that tends to come with a long series (read: James Bond)? It will surely be a challenge but not one I'd care to contemplate now as I'd much rather savor the greatness of this new Star Trek."

","i saw this fantastic movie with a non trek fan. It was a fantastic experience for both of us. It was very fast paced and full of good special effects. For non science fiction fans, the time travel paradox was not easy to explain after the movie. But this movie is complete in every detail. i wanna watch it again and own in blue ray disc for sure. 127 minutes worth watching. The story line is great, it contains everything: there's fun, there's tension, there 's thriller, battleships. It's not lame at all and there's plenty to watch. I do hope to see star trek number 2 soon and a TV series too with the same level of fast pace and special effects. Well done JJ and Friends"
"ferguson-6","7","2","11","10 May 2009"," Dammit Jim!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Full disclosure: I am not a Trekie and I have a personal rule - any film with Bruce Greenwood sucks. So imagine my pleasant surprise when I actually enjoyed JJ Abrams newest reincarnation of the franchise AND Mr. Greenwood plays a pivotal role! No doubt serious Star Trek fans will be disappointed in the content. Sci-fi details play a minuscule role in this wide-eyed, special effects feast. This film is closer to being ""Spider-man"" than it is to being a science fiction lesson. As a matter of fact, the black hole creations are a bit humorous to even a science dope like me. Still for two hours you can't take your eyes off the screen ... except when the idiot behind you keeps kicking your seat.<br/><br/>Casting is stellar and really helps the film work. Chris Pine (so excellent in Bottle Shock as the goofy son) and Zachary Quinto (Heroes) are terrific as Jim Kirk and Spock, the early years. We see the early head-butting and foundation for the friendship. An unrecognizable Eric Bana plays bad guy Nero and Karl Urban is very good as the serious Bones McCoy. Beautiful Zoe Saldana seems to overact a bit as Uhura and Simon Pegg livens up the film, even though he seems misplaced, as Scotty.<br/><br/>Don't miss Winona Ryder as Spock's mom, Jennifer Morrison (House) as Kirk's mom in intergalactic labor and ultra-rich Tyler Perry as the Admiral in charge of the hearing for a cheating Jim Kirk. All nice touches by TV guru, Abrams. Still, by far the most fun, is Leonard Nimoy's time on screen. He brings a majestic presence and a touch of class and history to his role. Very cool.<br/><br/>Music is fine, but you have to wait for the end credits to hear the original theme song (written by creator Gene Roddenberry). JJ Abrams has delivered a very watchable and exciting chapter to the Star Trek franchise ... not a simple thing to do in light of some of the past attempts."
"thesar-2","9","2","11","9 May 2009"," Star Royale: Boldly Continue!
","I'm a fan of the 'Star Trek' universe, and know a lot about it. However, I have yet to see an original episode of the 60s TV show. That being said, I am very attuned to episodes and the mythology behind it. 2009's 'Star Trek' reboot does it justice and then some. You get Pike, you get the green sexy female, you get the original Enterprise (how many ships/letters did they go through?) In fact, you get all that original material and lines that people grew up on. And the most amazing thing is that J.J. Abrams (solely underrated 'Mission: Impossible III') is NOT a 'Star Trek' fan. He was able to take such a storied and solid franchise and play tribute while delivering a great popcorn/summer film. 'Star Trek' was visually stunning, had great action pieces, suspense, comedy, cameos, continuity, and even a great cast that followed 'The Brady Bunch Movie' with mirrored, younger cast members that were perfect for the roles (it took awhile for Scotty to show up, but great-in-everything Pegg, and when he did, it surely added dimensions to the film.) Yes, it's another 'Trek' film, yes, it has cameos from films past (Nimoy) and yes, it's another time-traveling 'Trek' feature, but BOY, was it entertaining. I would highly recommend this movie, to 'Trek' lovers and non-believers. Visually stunning as it was, it proves, given the right script, these reboots ('Casino Royale,' 'Batman Begins,' and 'Halloween') actually add so much to the pot. The movie, concerning a time traveling, revenge filled Romulan (Bana) and a wet-behind-the-ears space-cadets only flaws involve the weak Nimoy storyline (it almost seemed forced, yet, I loved seeing him again, and his devotion to his Kirk-friendship) and the ho-hum villain, Bana. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this movie."
"shanpanjwani","10","2","11","9 May 2009"," A modern marvel-the epitome of summer blockbuster!!!
","Bottom line: Words cannot possibly explain the magnitude of perfection of this movie. Let me start off by saying that i am not a fan of the show, and have not seen an episode. When i first saw the previews, i was stopped dead in my tracks and decided to make it one of my top 5 or ten of movies to see over this summer. i expected a decent movie, and had fairly average expectations for it. When i went to see it yesterday, i was simply BLOWN AWAY!!! The movie has everything you could ask for in a single film-its has drama, it has emotion, the comedy is spectacular, and of course the action is top notch!!! Chris Pine obviously did more than a reasonable job as Captain James T. Kirk, and Zachary Quinto was superb as Spock-the one character that just about everyone who knows anything about star trek has at least heard of. John Cho, Zoe Saldana and Bruce Greenwood all did well also. There are, however, four people who really, really need to be praised for their roles in this spectacular film, starting with the always respectable Simon Pegg, who surprisingly has perhaps his greatest, funniest, and perhaps the most respectable role thus far in his young acting career, and was a perfect fit for providing much of the comic relief of the film. Secondly, Leonard Nimoy, who is often bowed down upon as the original Spock, does a fantastic job in a surprising role in this movie, and only garners more praise in doing so. Thirdly, is the most unexpected acting role in the film, and is that of Nero, the villain in the movie portrayed spectacularly by the hardly recognizable Eric Bana, who clearly showcased as much of a surprising and unexpected performance as that of Jeffery Dean Morgan in Watchmen, and obviously deserved more screen time. However, the one person who CLEARLY immortalized his name into Hollywood is none other than JJ Abrams himself, who co-wrote, directed, and produced this visual and mental spectacle. He did what no director has ever been able to do with a movie adapted from a TV series or a comic book before:not only did he rejuvenate the series, gather more fans for it, and make the majority of trekkies proud, but he did it with a rather unknown cast. He knew the risk he was taking, but ultimately he lived up to much, much more than anyone's expectations. This movie is so great that, it even got a 95% on rotten tomatoes, which is fairly close to unthinkable!!Some people have thought about possibly seeing it online off a torrent, but let me tell you, the SOUND AND VISUAL EFFECTS ARE SIMPLY BREATH-taking, and actually contribute more to the story than solely for just entertainment purposes, and should be mandated to be seen in theaters!!! It is worth any ticket price, and if you are a fan of comedy, action, sci-fi, drama, or all of these genres, then this is a movie for YOU!!! While there will be several expected blockbusters to be released in theaters this summer, such as the already released and enjoyable Wolverine, Angels and demons, Terminator Salvations, Land of the Lost, Up, Nam2, Pelham 123, Year one, Transformers 2, Ice Age 3,Public Enemies, Harry Potter 6, Funny People, GI Joe, Inglorious Bastards, Final Destination 3D and many more, this is clearly looking like one of the best of them all!!! A must see, and the EPITOME OF SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS-past, present, and soon to come!!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","11","8 May 2009"," Boldly going where ""Star Trek"" has needed to go for some time
","In a decade of reboots comes perhaps the most daring and challenging: the Star Trek franchise. With 40 years of history including a total of around 15 movies and/or TV spin- offs, a database of hardcore fans and a recent history of trailing off into oblivion, Star Trek has been on life support for about the last quarter of that time. Then came J.J. Abrams, a producer/director whose respect and credibility in the business had been entirely created in that 10-year span -- and suddenly Star Trek is getting the makeover that Trekkies might have feared, but that it definitely deserved. The new ""Star Trek"" is a true 21st-Century Star Trek (how fitting): explosive, exciting, character-driven and a miraculous spectacle to behold. It is surely 2009s first critical and box office success.<br/><br/>""Star Trek"" follows the great action reboots before it in returning Star Trek to its origins: how the U.S.S Enterprise, the golden ship of Starfleet, protectors of the universe , came into being and how its characters forged their relationship on board its deck. Although there is a time travel element to the plot that declares this is an alternate reality and not the true story (to cleanse the creators of any mythos sins they elected to commit), it's a darn fine story that really establishes its characters and shows a maturing process.<br/><br/>The catch is that in the future -- a long time after the U.S.S. Enterprise formed -- a Romulan aboard a mining ship named Nero (Eric Bana) watches as his home planet is destroyed by a supernova, an event that arguably could have been stopped ahead of time. The person he blames is Spock -- yes, the one we've come to know played by Leonard Nimoy. When Nero's ship is sent back in time by a black hole technology to the time when Star Trek heroes Spock and James T. Kirk are born, he decides to take his revenge by plotting the destruction of planet Vulcan and making Spock watch his home get destroyed.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we witness the growth of Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) and learn how they join Starfleet, as well as the rest of the crew. The evil plot against Vulcan is what brings them aboard the Enterprise for the first time and under these altered reality circumstances, their friendship becomes quite rocky as they try and stop Nero.<br/><br/>""Star Trek"" is an epic story of character development. Vulcans are notorious for being emotionless, but Spock is tested as a half-human whose planet is under attack. Kirk is a farm boy with all the leadership skills but too much of an ego who must learn what it takes to really become a leader. <br/><br/>Abrams and writers Orci (""Transformers"") and Kurtzman (who writes with Orci on Abrams' newest TV show ""Fringe"") decide to focus their attention on this and ways to cook up exciting visual sequences, spending less time on what made Star Trek a cultural force back in the '60s: the diversity, the belief in peaceful coexistence and the incurable optimism. ""Star Trek"" isn't a dark or pessimistic re-imagining at all, but it's distinctly more modern and with that comes intensity and more introspection. It's a different optimism, one that's much more ... informed.<br/><br/>The mostly unknown cast is excellent. Abrams always seems to get great small-budget actors in his projects, ""LOST"" being a fine example, or more significantly that he made Jennifer Garner's career by casting her in ""Alias."" Quinto (from NBC's ""Heroes"") is fantastic as a Spock wrestling between emotion and reason and Pine is a really terrific find. Rarely do you find someone with leading man looks and presence who fits himself perfectly into a role as esteemed as Cpt. Kirk. He earns your respect very quickly, even though he's a wise guy. Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg (""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hott Fuzz"") as Scotty are excellent choices as well. Even John Cho breaks the stoner mold that ""Harold and Kumar"" created as Sulu. <br/><br/>This is a visually striking film. If nothing else, the action will blow away anyone from the biggest Trekkie to the person who thinks Klingons actually cling onto things. There is no lack of imagination on Abrams' part, from the space jump suits to the 2009-style phasers and shuttles. In terms of staying true to the source, Abrams gets a passing grade. The best way to go into the film, however, is to be knowledgeable and mildly aware of the Trek lore. People with no idea will be thoroughly entertained, but the more educated yet open-minded you are, the more ""Star Trek"" will blow your mind. This will be an exciting new series of films for this incredible franchise."

","This movie was ver y good restarting of a great series of movies. This is movie that started finally a new series of better movies. In this one, you will not meet luke skywalker or han solo very much, because in this one, the characters are different, but it is ok because it is same world. You will miss dart hvader fighting his son and yoda saying very smart things. But it is a new kind of feel from this, because this is more like star trekking instead of a big star war, so they are traveling in stars instead of going to a war in them, and it is great because jj abrams continue after this one to make more star wars movies, so he know how to show both sides. You will like this movie the way it shows you the characters doing something different and not fighting a death star this time.After they make this movie, it must have made very many money because they were able to make six more movie, but unfortunately, the other new star wars will never be as good as this first one. They should maybe do more movies where they are trekking in the stars instead of fighting war because death star get old, but new trekking always very interesting."
"johnnylaiyee","10","2","12","17 June 2009"," Yet another amuzement by Abrams
","Frankly speaking, I'm not a trekkie. I don't even watch a episode of the original series. But I am a big fan of Abrams since Lost, MI:3 and Cloverfield. I did enjoy what JJ brought to the audiences, those stylish direction of action and fresh creativity of story telling perspective(Cloverfield and Lost). So I did have lots of expectation when I walked into the cinema. When the ending credit started rolling, my head was filled with ""Wow!"" and ""Yeah!"". You did it again, Abrams. You successfully created an instant classic of epic sci-fi hip movie. I was fully satisfied even exceeded my expectation. The 127 minutes seems so fast to me (especially after watching the ""short but seems long"" Terminator Salvation). Although there are some insufficiencies in the plot but those cool space fighting CGI scenes and blood-boiling action scenes did covered the little imperfect in the plot. Talking about the casts, without any presumptions, I could say Zachary Quinto did give me surprise. I watched his performance in Heroes when he played Sylar, a cold-blooded serial killer. In this movie, he plays Spock, a trying to be cold-blooded character. He pulled a good job in portraying the internal conflict in weather to feel like a human or logic like a Vulcan. The other cast who impressed me is Eric Bana, the all time protagonist who plays Nero the evil alien. I almost couldn't recognize him by looking at his bold head with scary tattoos. His villain role was unexpectedly vivid and believable. Karl Urban, always casted as a villain (both in The Bourne Supremacy and The Chronicles of Riddick) plays Dr. Bone with a comedy manner and fitted his role perfectly. The rest of the casts performed good enough to earn my satisfaction. And some other features gave me an entertaining 127 minutes (Score, Visual effects...), i could say this is the best movie in 2009 (till June), if you are still in a dilemma between Terminator Salvation and Star Trek, trust your heart, choose the one you like, but if i were you, trust this review, or trust JJ Abrams."
"Gimicles","10","2","12","25 May 2009"," Positively brilliant!!
","This movie was positively brilliant! In my opinion, any movie that can honestly make you cry within the first ten minutes, and cause you to fall out of your chair laughing within the first twenty is a good movie. I would not go into detail so as to spoil potential viewers, but believe me, even if you are not a Star Trek fan, you would be able to grasp most of the concepts provided and laugh and cry and gasp with the rest of us.<br/><br/>Obviously, there are lines and references that would be more clear if you knew what they were talking about, but even without the previous knowledge of the Star Trek universe, things make sense. They do quite nicely in setting up *this* world so that one can understand what is happening as it pertains to this particular situation.<br/><br/>Not only is it a good movie in Star Trek terms, but in all-around movie terms! The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and I can only imagine how much green screen they had to work with! But the visual effects don't serve to alienate the characters, as it might in other movies. The movie is not focused on space travel but the development of the characters, and therefore the visual effects only serve as an elegantly painted backdrop to the story, not a main component. And, especially in comparison to previously made movies, the acting is *quite* superb. All of the characters are brilliantly portrayed by the actors involved, helped along considerably by the expertly written script. there is not a dull moment, but at the same time there is not an overload of information and action. Young Spock (Zachary Quinto) especially quite adeptly illustrates the conflict of being a child of two worlds and not belonging to either, but desperately wishing to. And one can easily see how young James Kirk (Christ Pine) develops into the older Kirk of the original series. The characters are remarkably quite true to form.<br/><br/>I know there has been quite a fuss that the technology of the Enterprise is not the same as the original series, which is quite absurd. Of course it's different! Futuristic in 60's terms was flip top communication devices and small hand held screens holding a plethora of information . . . which is entirely commonplace these days. Star Trek is supposed to be futuristic, and so they have to raise the bar considerably higher than the original 60's TV show. And, in true Star Trek fashion, they did so in a believable way. One could see how our technology could advance to such a place, even though it is not there quite yet.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was amazing. Not only do I plan to see it again in theaters but I wait quite impatiently for the DVD release. This movie is in no way a waste of time or money, and I would recommend it to anyone!"

I enjoyed every SECOND of it and I was watching at my watch whole the movie wishing it wouldn't end. As it has a descent length the movie is very enjoyable. I just love the way how the actors blend in in their roles, you can really see Bones his unique dialogs with Cpt. Kirk. One thing bothers me Uhura is way to sexy in that mini-skirt to wonder why no one ***** her before she had a relationship with a Vulcan. (..) Anyway I loved the way ""Old Spock"" came in the movie, his role was short but so good. The role from Cpt. Nero is good as well, same counts for everyone else. The die-hard trek fans won't have much to bitch moan and cry about this movie. Cus it really follows up good.. Anyway I hope it won't end with this movie. I hope they will at least make a trilogy...<br/><br/>95/100"
"alex06-1","10","2","12","20 May 2009"," An excellent reboot sure to breed a new generation of final frontier explorers.
","I've been a bit of a Star Trek fan since I was a kid, in part because it was the closest thing to a Star Wars TV show that I had at the time. I learned about it sometime after Star Wars obviously and I've seen episodes from just about every series, though I never did end up watching them religiously for some reason. I'm sure people who've seen the series from its roots have a much deeper understanding of the series than I could hope to achieve, but I've been fascinated by the worlds Star Trek had to offer for many years.<br/><br/>Then there are the movies and the recent years. I've actually seen every Star Trek movie made, even the fifth one that's loathed by many (I saw it when I was a kid FYI, so I don't remember the flaws it had that well). I hadn't seen every episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but I did see enough to be able to tell you that Star Trek Nemesis, that was made back in 2002, was a really disappointing way to end the series. Then there's the TV show ""Enterprise"" which served as the ultimate prequel to the rest of the shows. Apparently it got lower ratings than I thought it did, but it apparently didn't win over many fans, even to the point of where afterwards the Star Trek brand just disappeared for the most part. <br/><br/>Now we're here in 2009 with a new movie simply titled ""Star Trek"". This movie is intended to be a reboot of the said franchise by going back to the roots that made Star Trek what it was, and offering a totally new origin story for the classic 1966 series. This much is certain, after 7 years of all but losing its credibility, this was a ""do or die"" scenario for the series. This would either be the final nail in the coffin, or the kick in the rear that it needed to get back on course. What I'm really, really, pleased to say, is that J.J. Abrams chose to give the series the later option. I say that's a good thing because J.J. has set up a universe for a promising new beginning with the movie. I'll give you the bare bones of what the story is like, the movie begins with a bang, the USS Kelvin is under attack from a Romulan mining vessel. In this scene, the crew is escaping, while George Kirk is ordered to see everyone off, including his pregnant wife. In their last few moments over a telecom chat, they decide to name him after Winona's father, James. After the escape scene and the destruction of the Kelvin, we're treated to seeing James getting himself in Juvinile Detention when he drives a car off of a cliff and manages to jump out at the last minute... He's pretty young at this point too... About 8 I'd guess.<br/><br/>We also get to see the iconic Spock grow up with his ""disability"" as a half-Vulcan, causing him to reject his membership at the Vulcan Science Academy, thus leaving him only the option of joining Starfleet Command on Earth. What ensues afterwards is a space opera involving the old cast of characters reincarnated to appeal to the new generation. We even get a guest visit from Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) of pre-series establishment fame. Not only are the characters likable, but the storytelling is epic, the humor allows for camp sessions but remains consistent just like in the previous shows, there's even a huge nod to the original series at a point in the movie, and the casting is very well done to boot.<br/><br/>I wasn't too worried about Zachary Quinto since even though I've only seen one episode of ""Heroes,"" I knew the show itself was very well casted. What really had me staying observant though was Chris Pine as James, since if you look at his bibliography he's a pretty new actor, his first movie being Princess Diaries 2: The Royal Engagement, and stared only in romantic comedies afterwards. Not only does Chris Pine work as the new Kirk, but the rest of the cast with their trademark personality traits are here as well. Checkov has the accent and he can beam up people, Sulu is Asian and is the pilot, it's basically all the same from the original show, the only real difference being that Pike is the Captain while Kirk is under service to the Enterprise.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with Star Trek's storytelling, you'd know that it can be campy, epic, and provoking at the same time like the Star Wars movies. Star Trek pulls this off very well, there are serious moments that the crew encounters at times and sometimes they pull off a little tongue and cheekiness, but it's not done in heartfelt situations that don't call for it.<br/><br/>Star Trek is a very welcome addition to the summer line up considering the last sci-fi movie that had me as enticed as I was Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and it's been four years already. That's too long for me since I can't name many other space operas off the top of my head besides Serenity and The Fifth Element. I can only hope the movie does well in theaters and the end result is sequels.<br/><br/>So overall say, ""See it!"" Star Trek (2009) is a very complete movie that offers a new future for the classic franchise. It has a wide amount of appeal and not much to complain about. Let's hope that with this movie in place that new entries to the series are made based off of it."
"jessiemaran","10","2","12","10 May 2009"," Perfect
","I always thought Star Trek was amusing but clunky. This one was simple in the best sense of the word, or I could say clean not convoluted. It never tries to over explain. <br/><br/>I loved it because you get to know each one of the characters just enough to feel something for them, which is really unusual with these big movies, but it also leaves you wanting more. The way it represents the different ethnic groups is sensitive and inspiring. Good people aren't all white and the darks aren't the enemy. Certain movies like 300 though an extremely entertaining movie offended a lot of people of color. In Star Trek, there is no ""Token"" Asian or ""token"" black. Bravo to all involved."
"Monotreme02","8","2","12","9 May 2009"," Big, fun, entertaining - has it all and more
","I think that the major reason the film is so good, enjoyable and successful, is because it manages to achieve something that few summer blockbusters manage to achieve, except for the few occasional exceptions, such as Iron Man last summer and Transformers the summer before that: Abrams' Star Trek is not afraid of comedy. Sure, it delivers in all the other facets that summer blockbusters are expected to deliver in – top-notch special effects, breathtaking set pieces and thrilling, heart-pounding action scenes – but where Star Trek succeeds where few other summer blockbusters do is that for every tense, high-octane action set piece, there is also a loose, relaxed and absolutely laugh-out-loud hilarious scene to go with it. I don't think it's coincidental that this film was written by the same screen writing duo that wrote Transformers a couple of years back, as they injected that film with a lot of intentional comedy as well. And yet, just as the likes of Shia LaBeouf, Anthony Anderson and John Turturro carried and delivered much of the comedy in Transformers, I believe that much of the comedic success of Star Trek lies on the cast.<br/><br/>And a truly wonderful cast it is – and an eclectic one at that. Looking over the cast list, one might wonder what all these actors have to do with one another – I mean who thought he'd ever see Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Eric Bana, Winona Ryder and Leonard Nemoy in the same movie together? And yet, it works, and be it a testament to J.J. Abrams' directorial chops or the actors' own skills, the cast members all have truly great chemistry with one another. The film will undoubtedly make stars of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, both of whom prove quite impressive skills in the film. The dynamic between their characters is crucial to the film and really builds its emotional backbone, and it could have easily been a hit-and-miss thing had Abrams made the wrong casting choices. Luckily, he took two genuine talents, both of which play their well-defined characters quite well, nailing all of their personality quirks and mannerisms and truly embodying their characters. That said, the most entertaining performances derive from the supporting characters, and a few actors in particular totally steal the show from the otherwise first-rate cast. First up is Eric Bana, who delivers a particularly juicy, scenery-chewing performance as Nero, the film's villain. Next we have young Anton Yelchin, who delivers what is probably the second funniest and most enjoyable performance of the whole lot, truly nailing the quirky mannerisms of his character. But the scene-stealing crown belongs undeniably to Simon Pegg, who is an inherently funny guy as it is, but with a thick Scottish drawl, manages to be even more so than usual.<br/><br/>One cannot discuss a major science fiction-action epic such as this without mentioning its technical aspects, specifically its special effects. Based on this movie and also the apparent quality of the special effects work as seen in the trailers for some other upcoming summer blockbusters, namely Terminator Salvation, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it seems like 20 years after The Abyss, CGI imagery has finally reached its peak. The quality of these effects has been quite varied these past few years – for every Transformers and Harry Potter there's a Spiderman or a Star Wars prequel – but with Star Trek at least, nothing can really be said about the CGI other than that ILM and Digital Domain did a fantastic job and that the effects look 100% real and convincing. The spaceships are sleek and shiny, environment extensions are completely seamless, and the adrenaline-pumping space battles are dynamic and exciting – all CGI. Luckily, though, Abrams did not follow in many of his mentors' footsteps, and still managed to show an appreciation of real, practical sets, instead of setting his film in entirely CGI environments. Also worth mentioning is the simply fantastic sound design and editing by Ben Burtt, who was robbed of a pair of Oscars in the sound categories at the Academy Awards last year for his unparalleled work in WALL-E, but who hopefully will get his due this year come the Oscars.<br/><br/>I wanted a no-holds-barred, hits-the-ground-running, pure and untainted summer blockbuster entertainment, and an entertainment I did receive. J.J. Abrams has this uncanny ability of knowing just what his audience wants to see, and delivering something even better. Although not really a re-boot as it retains much from its original source material both in terms of the content and characters but also because the plot actually manages to integrate it into the continuity of the show, this Star Trek movie still does deviate greatly from its campy roots, and is very much a completely and utterly modern, up-to-date work of science fiction. The action is bigger and better, the effects work is remarkable, the design, look and feel of this well-established world is all updated to meet the most current standards, and the characters and film itself all have a certain manner and attitude that wholly defines our era. Big explosions, impressive visuals, space battles, thrills, excitement, edge-of-your seat tension – Abrams' latest summer blockbuster has it all and more, and all that, added together with some really hilarious (and frequent) comic relief and some great performances and character dynamics and chemistry, serves to deliver a great summer entertainment, just a genuinely fun time at the movies and an early candidate for the title of best film of the summer"
"wolftab-1","7","2","12","9 May 2009"," A Solid Prequel
","The eagerly anticipated reboot of the the Star Trek series finally has arrived with (technically the 11th film in the series) the self titled Star Trek by the popular new action/drama wunderkind JJ Abrams at the helm. In full disclosure I need to point out that I have been a huge Star Trek fan (mainly Next Generation) for a long time. When I heard they wanted to give a much needed jump start to the franchise by making a prequel, I was skeptical. I mean, c'mon, do we really need to see a movie of Kirk and Spock Go to Starfleet. But, for all intent and purpose, JJ Abrams has done a pretty good job of making a younger, slicker and action packed Star Trek that introduces us to the beloved characters that have been satirized and joked about for decades.<br/><br/>The film straddles the two worlds of hardcore Trekkies and non Trekkies alike by exploring the origins of the two main characters...James Tiberius Kirk and a half human/half Vulcan named Spock. Unbeknown to them, they share a common bond of family tragedy in their lives. We meet them both as precocious children in their own right. The rebellious Kirk and the ever logical Spock. But, what I liked is they give Spock more freedom of expression than what we would see in the original series and the subsequent first 6 films. Mercifully, we are quickly taken through their days of Star Fleet and how they came to join the Academy. Their paths of getting there were similar in its guise and it is here that we also are introduced to Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy who quickly befriends Kirk. All this while, the evil Captain Nero of the enemy Romulans is wrecking havoc on the galaxy and it is up to our young and inexperienced heroes traveling in the newly christened Enterprise to save the day, which you know they will...it's Star Trek.<br/><br/>Before I get into what is good about the film let me say what I didn't like about it. Aside from the usual predictability and necessary suspension of disbelief. I was not at all interested in the evil Romulan threat, it wasn't interesting enough. And of course, in Star Trek world, when in doubt throw in a time travel plot line. I also felt JJ rushed through the introductions of the characters and giving some of them like McCoy cute dialogue that is representative of how we have come to know these characters in the past. The climax was also quick and clean, without any real suspense. I'll get into the acting soon enough. What I liked about the film was the special effects were fantastic, seeing Leonard Nimoy again as Spock. He certainly still remembers the characterization very well. Trekkies will love bringing in Captain Pike but he seemed to be an afterthought once we are settled on to the Enterprise As for the acting. First of all, before I get slammed with angry messages, let me just say that Star Trek is not a story that demands stellar acting. However, as an actor, good work is demanded of you at all times to make the story truthful. Chris Pine who portrays the iconic James T Kirk grows on you. He embody's the characteristics we know about Kirk, a horny, rebel who plays by his own rules. But, except for one occasion he made Kirk his own with no trace of William Shatner and I applaud him for that. Zachary Quinto (Sylar from Heroes) brought emotional depth underneath all that logic and I thought he was the best of them all. The great Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead himself) was pretty funny as Scotty and I welcomed his comic relief. As for Karl Urban as McCoy. He was highly irritating. He essentially mimicked DeForest Kelley's work as McCoy and although you hear imitation is the finest form of flattery, it's not in this case. Create your own character. Same goes for Anton Yelchin as Chekov, he just mimicked. Walter Koenig. Some found it cute. I didn't. John Cho did a decent job as Sulu, we certainly see a new side of him. Zoe Saldana as Uhura also decided to create her own character and even though she is essentially filler, she made the most of her scenes. There is an interesting twist to her love life from the original series that's for sure. Finally, Eric Bana as Captain Nero was boring and completely devoid of interest for me. He was indicating badly to the point of annoyance. Great Star Trek villains like Ricardo Montelban as Khan, Christopher Plummer as General Chang and Alice Krige as the Borg Queen all made me feel something about who they are and the reasons why they did what they did. I hope JJ takes note of that in the next one.<br/><br/>Overall, Star Trek is entertaining with all it's faults (there are gaps in the writing). I would rate it the 4th best in the film series. It's not a great film but it exceeded my expectations. As far as prequels go, this was one of the better ones I've seen. Yes, it's is even better than Star Wars Episode 1. However, I would recommend in the sequel that JJ take his time and not rush through sequences and make the villains have more depth. I give Star Trek 3 stars and is out now in a theater near you."
"clarenceporter","Null","1","4","12 September 2018"," Only watch if you are a Trekkie
","Star Trek is an unnecessary reboot in my opinion. JJ Abrabs is a talented filmmaker and it is easy to see his enthusiasm (he is almost like a fanboy giddily recreating all his favorite childhood movies) and rigor but the reboot and especially the cast will always suffer from comparison with the original TV series. Furthermore, although the film is interesting and gets everything sorted- in as much as one can in less than 2 hours- there is a rushed feeling to the proceedings. The special effects are good but we've seen it all by now, the razzle and dazzle only goes so far. The Star trek reboot isn't a bad film as much as an unneeded one."

","I am reviewing this as a stand alone film because I have never seen any of the original Star Trek movies or series so I can't exactly comment on those what I thought of this film was that it wasn't bad I mean it was quite slow at times and not too much action but the acting was quite good by the entire cast now I don't know too much about their characters but the performances were good and it wasn't poorly made or anything like that the special effects were great this wasn't hard to understand the story was pretty straightforward I know a lot of people who are fans of the original series,Next Generation and the films didn't enjoy it and they have their reasons but as a stand alone it's quite enjoyable I think of it as that because like I said this is my first Star Trek film I will definitely watch Into Darkness soon as well I hear that's the best one and Beyond after that because I am somewhat intrigued I give it a 6/10 for the most part I enjoyed it."

","At this point, everything has probably already been said about this movie, but I'll add my two cents anyway.<br/><br/>I've recently become a fan of Star Trek (TOS) and I liked this modern take on the classic show a lot.<br/><br/>But let's just start with the annoying element. I was well aware of this movie's reputation regarding the overuse of lens flares and I must say that that this reputation is far from undeserved. I have sensitive eyes and some scenes really hurt the poor fellows. <br/><br/>Now this is said, let's move on to more interesting aspects.<br/><br/>I wasn't very interested in the action sequences (especially the big ones), but that's my personal tastes, not necessarily a flaw on the movie's part.<br/><br/>I was much more interested in the characters, and in that respect I wasn't disappointed. I thought that we could really believe that we were seeing younger versions of the characters from the original series. The blend of truthfulness to the originals and modern sensibility was very well done.<br/><br/>My favorite character in this movie was Chekov. It helps, of course, that Anton Yelchin has been a favorite of mine for a while (I still find it hard to believe that he's no longer with us). I don't have enough words to say how much I loved the scenes they've written for him and Yelchin's acting. But I had been, before watching the movie, the most anxious to see how the trio of Kirk, Spock and Bones would be portrayed and I was more than pleased with the result! Uhura was very good as well, even if her role was somewhat small, and I hope that in future films there are more (good) female characters, because in a modern movie it seems weird to have almost only men in the main cast.<br/><br/>Anyway, the distinct lack of bad actors in this movie is one big reason why I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>The tone felt a bit weird at times. There were goofy moments that reminded me more of Marvel movies than of the Star Trek I know (which is limited to the original series so far). But I am, after all, a fan of Marvel movies, and I'd rather not have a blockbuster that takes itself too seriously. It is entertainment, after all, and we still had good moments of emotion and tension.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see the sequels, now!<br/><br/>Oeuvre_Klika out."
"jscherber","8","1","4","10 October 2015"," Best Star Trek film yet
","This is considered the best star trek film yet, and I can see why. It is almost completely perfect. The story focuses on how the enterprise crew first met each other, where they try to stop a mysterious alien called Nero from destroying federation planets. The story is very fast-paced and exciting, with an interesting time travel revelation in the middle. Because of the time travel it is in a slightly different reality from the original series. Kirk starts off as a trouble making delinquent instead of a role model, which makes his character a lot better. Him and Spock originally hated each other but respect each other by the end. It's a good action/adventure story while also keeping good focus on the characters and their relationships. The acting, especially by Chris Pine(Kirk) was mostly pretty good. But what really sets this apart is the visuals. It's so much more creative and fascinating than the previous shows and movies. Not only does it look more polished and convincing but it's totally beautiful and goes into a lot more detail on creatures, the spaceships and planets."

There are plenty of jokes, many of them cheesy, including the corny ""I'm a doctor"" and ""Vulcan mind""...<br/><br/>It seems they are setting up this film series as an alternate reality.

","An orphaned James T Kirk joins the Star Fleet Academy, but is he mature enough to help out the Federation? <br/><br/>If you ever watched the Original Series, this is barely it.

","How the new Star Trek failed - originally posted on Zauberspiegel. I'd include a link, but IMDb won't let me :( To read the full review I'd suggest doing a search on the title, and the website, as IMDb doesn't allow enough words.<br/><br/>The new Star Trek is a disaster. J. J. Abrams is an idiot, and he's ruining the Star Trek franchise. Strong words? Yes, but true.<br/><br/>Star Trek was the first successful Science Fiction television show. Star Trek was a success for several reasons:<br/><br/>1. Solid Setting 2. Good Characters 3. Excellent Plots (well, sometimes)<br/><br/>Gene Roddenbury got some things wrong. David Gerrold covered several of these in his book The World of Star Trek. While I don't agree with all of his conclusions (you don't take children on a warship), the book is well worth reading, and several of his suggestions were adopted (including taking children on a warship).<br/><br/>The original Star Trek has been in constant syndication since it was taken out of production, and along with Doctor Who is one of the most culturally significant television shows ever produced.<br/><br/>Star Trek spawned further television series.<br/><br/>Star Trek: The Animated Series Star Trek: The Next Generation Deep Space Nine Star Trek Voyageur Star Trek: Enterprise<br/><br/>This happened over a 40 year time span, and in addition there were ten movies. There is also a successful book line, a wide range of fan made television episodes and movies, a thriving fan fiction community, and Science Fiction Conventions devoted to Star Trek.<br/><br/>I'm intimately familiar with Star Trek. I watched it when it first aired, attended my first Star Trek convention in 1976, played Star Fleet Battles, the starship combat board game, wrote Trek Fan Fiction, and even watched the first two seasons of Star Trek: The Degeneration (no disrespect meant to the actors, but when Roddenbury was pushed out, the show lost its spark).<br/><br/>In this case, it all comes down to setting.<br/><br/>Mistake Number 1<br/><br/>From Wikipedia: But according to The Making of Star Trek ""the Enterprise-class starships have been in existence for about forty years"" at the time of the original series. The ship's components were built at the Starfleet Division of the San Francisco Navy Yards and assembled in orbit.<br/><br/>Assembled in orbit. Now why do you think that they'd do that? Simple. The ship is not designed for atmospheric operations. To quote the Memory Alpha Wiki:<br/><br/>Though not an aerodynamic craft, in emergencies, Constitution-class vessels were able to break orbit and enter a Class M planet's upper atmosphere (and maintain altitude control while passing through it) for a limited period of time, conditional on the ship's ability to re-achieve escape velocity.<br/><br/>(TOS: ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"")<br/><br/>Components came from the Navy Yards, not the entire ship. Most of the ship was probably assembled from materials mined in the asteroids. Why boost materials to orbit, when you don't have to? Build the hi-tech components on Earth, build the low-tech structural materials in space, where you probably have a less capable infrastructure, and a smaller workforce.<br/><br/>This also reduces the need to mine Earth for materials. For some metals it may be necessary to mine one hundred tons of ore to produce one ton of finished metal. The Enterprise NCC-1701 is supposed to weigh 799,400 metric tons, and could require up to 8,000,000 metric tons of ore! That's a lot of ore. For comparison USS Enterprise CVN-65 weighs only 93,284 metric tons!<br/><br/>Memory Alpha has a list of Starfleet ships portrayed in the Star Trek movie. We can assume that it is incomplete, that there are more ships than mentioned. We can also assume that at least some ships were built on Vulcan or Andoria, but it is impressive.<br/><br/>USS Antares USS Armstrong USS Enterprise USS Farragut USS Hood USS Kelvin (destroyed early in the video) USS Mayflower USS Newton USS Truman USS Wolcott<br/><br/>It is extremely unlikely that they mined the ores for these ships from the asteroid belt, and landed them at Earth side shipyards. It would be the equivalent of dropping a hundred thousand Dinosaur Killers on the planet every year. Yes, I know, they'd use tractor beams to control the drop. Would you want to take the chance of a terrorist gaining control of the system, and dropping the load on a city instead? And of course, accidents do happen. Remember Fukushima? How about Chernobyl?"
"Mackiatoe","9","1","4","30 November 2012"," An instant classic that opens the doors for a whole new series
","I first watched the new Star Trek film after it came out on DVD, having not bothered to go to the cinema. I regret it now. Hugely. This is an instant classic that is done with such high quality, I feel it needs to be ranked against some of the best Sci-Fi films of all time. After a while, I felt the need to turn up the volume - you have to watch this film loud! And make sure you have some really good speakers with plenty of bass. That way you'll get the full, awesome experience. This new film completely revolutionises's the entire Star Trek universe, by starting with a brand new story line. That will almost certainly annoy some die- hard Trekky's, but boy did it get off to a good start.<br/><br/>I'll start with what I loved this film. The biggest thing you'll notice, especially if you have seen previous Star Trek films/TV series's is that everything has been modernised, yet Abrams was able to do this without ruining the basics that made the original Star Trek so good. All the original characters are back, but everything is much more glitzy and futuristic. The Enterprise looks fantastic, and it is by far my favourite version of it. Another thing that I love (and that many other's loves) is the new warp scene - it looks and feels so much better than previous warps. There's no doubt this is the best looking Star Trek, and despite the use of CGI instead of models, it look incredible. And, once again, the story was great. Surprisingly I didn't find hugely predictable. It's not one you have to watch twice to understand it, but there are a good few twists to keep you going. What's really good though is that it feels original. It's not been turned into a stupid clichéd bit of sci-fi nonsense that seems to be rather popular these days. The story, while wiping all previous films, including the original series, and starting fresh, opens up the basis for what could really be an incredible reboot to the Star Trek series, and for plenty of films to come - 'Into Darkness' isn't far away at the time of writing, and I will definitely being seeing it.<br/><br/>However, I do feel the need to be critical - this is a review after all! I am being very brutal here, just so you know. One thing I felt a little annoyed with was the music in some areas. In some important scenes, it didn't quite add the feel that I felt the scene required, so they didn't seem quite as good. Also, there were some slightly cheesy/clichéd moments which are very easy to pass. If anything, they add a bit of comedy into the film. And lastly, I felt the use of light blinding the camera in a straight line across the screen (you'll know what I mean when you see it/have seen it) was a little overused. It works fine with shots from in space, but when on board ships and on planets it didn't feel necessary.<br/><br/>That said, this is a seriously, seriously good film. I for one can't get enough of it, so much so that I am starting to become a Trekky myself! If you need a really good sci-fi thriller, here's everything you'll ever want. Star Trek is amazing, and I wait for the second, and hopefully third films that come after this one."

"slokes","7","1","4","31 July 2012"," Warping Good Time
","The past is never dead. It's not even past.<br/><br/>William Faulkner's famous words take on new life in this 2009 take on the classic 1960s sci-fi series, not so much a remake or reboot as a re-invigoration. People who grew up loving ""Star Trek,"" particularly what is known to Trek fans as ""The Original Series,"" may gulp at some of the liberties taken with familiar characters as Spock, Kirk, and Uhura, but they certainly will find much to surprise them, delight them (if they are open-minded enough going in) and certainly rekindle passions that connect with their inner child. Time warping, indeed.<br/><br/>In that light, the movie's plot seems quite appropriate. In the 23rd century, a band of tricked-out Romulans angry at the destruction of their planet travel back in time to avenge themselves on the Federation, whom they blame for their loss. Their actions alter what generations of fans have come to know as the Star Trek universe, to the point where the past is indeed not even the past.<br/><br/>Young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) finds himself not captain of the U. S. S. Enterprise but a brig-bound renegade, one harboring understandable antipathy for a half-human, half-Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto) who is Enterprise's rigid commander and seems to harbor a decided dislike for the young Iowa hotshot. How much dislike? He maroons the poor kid on an ice planet for starters.<br/><br/>As one character tells Kirk in the film's second half: ""Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed."" Translation for hard-core Trekkers: Just relax and try to enjoy the show. Nothing's broken that breaking out the old series DVDs won't fix.<br/><br/>The clever concept embedded in Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman's script means the movie can work in all the references it wants to the series while changing things up in high style, celebrating what was great about the show and has lasted in our collective memory without laboring under too much backstory. Director J. J. Abrams facilitates this approach by emphasizing the human connections developed with the original Star Trek characters, as well as welcome shafts of humor that cut through the rousing action sequences and gee-whiz special effects.<br/><br/>Given all this, the movie only works as well as it does because of the sterling job done by the movie's principals, particularly the two leads. Quinto carves out some dark and original territory as Spock, understandable given the situation the film's plot puts him in, yet he also connects with Leonard Nimoy's defining interpretation of Spock from TV, both literally and figuratively. Quinto's the film's strongest asset.<br/><br/>Pine doesn't try to mimic his TV model, William Shatner, so much as present the same kind of wit and cocksure energy in a younger, less refined package, which comes off terrifically and connects with Abrams' tongue-in-cheek reverence for the material. Spock and Kirk take a long time to develop any kind of chemistry, but when they do, it's worth the wait.<br/><br/>I don't think ""Star Trek"" is all that great as a straight adventure movie. The central plot about the time-traveling Romulans flying around in their giant metal moth gets old fast. Visually, Abrams likes using flares way too much, and our patience is tested with too much exposition. I didn't care for Simon Pegg's comically broad interpretation of Enterprise engineer Montgomery Scott, while John Cho's Mr. Sulu is a bit dull (though perhaps because he's written too much that way.) The rest of the actors playing the movie's familiar characters really bring it, from Zoe Saldana's tough but emotional take on Uhura to Anton Yelchin's amusingly gonzo turn as Ensign Chekhov. Real fans may be surprised to see the easy gravitas Bruce Greenwood brings as a secondary series character, Captain Pike, who starts the movie as Enterprise's commander.<br/><br/>That's not all that will surprise them, of course, which is as it should be. ""Star Trek"" will be best appreciated by those with a healthy interest in the franchise going in, but it can be enjoyed by most non-Trek fans to a degree none of those earlier movies could, ironic considering how much more this film consciously hearkens back to the TV show than the earlier movies did (even, especially, those that featured the actors from the original series, which always seemed to try too hard at wholesale reinvention.)<br/><br/>The end result: A nice time-warp of an adventure film that gives the lie to a line by another famous writer: ""You can never go home again."""

","Before the Movie:<br/><br/>Star Trek The trailer looks EPIC. And I'm just in a mood for a awesome, action packed film for the summer. Granted it does stray from the original series with more action, drama, testosterone engorged action film. I watched Star Trek. As a child of 4-6 basic channels (varied based on the weather or the day) Star Trek was my savorier, when elmo and LeVar Burton from reading rainbow left for the weekend, I was left with Star Trek in my dead zone, my time of need. As a 7 year old I logically deducted that LeVar was my transition from PBS to any random channel that hosted Star Trek: the Next Generation. Geordi La Forge: my favorite character, besides Data (too obvious).<br/><br/>This film centers around the Kirk and Spock from the original series (which I didn't really care for). But action, intense glares, and swift moves this is my type of film.<br/><br/>Review: I saw it once with my friend, brother and boyfriend and watched it a second time in the theater with my dad. What can I say? It was AWESOME. Action, humor, drama and most importantly: charm. All I look for in movies are entertainment and heart. I was a bit apprehensive about the film (due to the Trekkieness) however, it was made into an outstanding major blockbuster, giving everyone a chance to find out for themselves the brilliance of Star Trek.<br/><br/>One quip I have about the movie was the bad guy, he was not really scary he reminded me of a tatted up gangster off of The Shield, who was victim of genocide after day labor. Wow, that was a total non-PC comment. However, it was my first assessment of the situation."

You could know next to nothing about ""Star Trek"" and still enjoy it.<br/><br/>The film was very well cast, with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto doing superb jobs as Kirk and Spock, respectively. Zoe Saldana did well as Uhura, and Karl Urban was also a standout as Bones. Anton Yelchin, John Cho, and Simon Pegg fill out the rest of the U.S.S. Enterprise crew very well, with several humorous one-liners from Pegg as Scotty.<br/><br/>Eric Bana plays Romulan baddie Nero, who wants revenge on Spock for something that has yet to occur. Bana played this role extremely well and had several standout moments. I'm still not sure why Tyler Perry (yes, that Tyler Perry) was in this, though. Look for a classic ""Star Trek"" character about midway through the film. Trust me, you won't miss him.<br/><br/>The action in this film is good too. There are several cool space battle scenes, and an intense confrontation between Kirk and Spock.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie for sci-fi fans, or people who love adventure movies."
"toqtaqiya2","8","1","4","13 October 2010"," Director J.J. Abrams resurrects the classic science fiction franchise created by Gene Roddenberry with this feature film.
","Star Trek is a successful update of a franchise that desperately needed an update. The film doesn't raise any new ideas in science-fiction and that's what keeps it from being a great film, but just about everything else about it is shiny and polished. Star Trek is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise and features the main characters of the original Star Trek television series, who are portrayed by a new cast. The film follows James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens the United Federation of Planets.<br/><br/>Watching Star Trek was the best time I had at the movies for well over a year. After the first part of the film ended and the film's title appeared accompanied by an uplifting music piece I felt the hair on my head rise up. From then I knew that this was going to be a good film. Star Trek isn't burdened by showing Kirk's and Spock's childhoods. It's all done rather quickly at the beginning. The fun starts when the two become young men. Chris Pine as Kirk provides most of the humor while Zachary Quinto as Spock is always serious and all-knowing. Both of them are very likable as is the rest of the crew of the USS Eterprise. For me the other standout performances were from Karl Urban as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy and Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov. Things were always interesting when Chekov was on screen. Zoe Saldana as Nyota Uhura turns out to be a strong female presence on the Enterprise (and by the way she's just gorgeous in this film). Simon Pegg as Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott is also good and as is to be expected, funny. And I can't forget John Cho as Hikaru Sulu. It was great to see him as the pilot of the Enterprise and then as a competent fencer. Eric Bana as the villain Nero on the other hand wasn't given much screen time. Although he's menacing and cool we don't see him do much other than giving orders and being angry. However, he, his crew and their gigantic Romulan mining ship Narada pose a real threat to the Federation throughout the film.<br/><br/>Now, what about the special effects? The special effects are state of the art. They look great too. For once in a science-fiction film we aren't shown a doomed future for mankind, but a prosperous one instead. Seeing the construction of a Federation space ship in Iowa or the incredibly tall skyscrapers and neat streets in the San Francisco of the future was like a breath of fresh air for me. Human science and tolerance has progressed in the future of Star Trek and that's fantastic. The space battles are also spectacular. Watching the Federation fleet go into warp speed was awe-inspiring for me. Oh, I almost forgot about Leonard Nimoy's presence in the film. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I will mention that his Spock plays an important role in the story. So he's not there just for show. Seeing Nimoy back was an additional treat for me. Star Trek is a blast from beginning to end. It's thrilling, funny, touching and action-packed. I give Star Trek a high recommendation."
"estebangonzalez10","9","1","4","16 September 2010"," This is how you reboot a franchise
","I have never been a fan of Star Trek but this film truly surprised me. J.J. Abrams did an excellent job at reviving this dead franchise and making this the best movie of 2009 so far. I think that fans and non fans will be equally entertained with this version of Star Trek which goes back to the beginning and shows us how James Kirk and Spock come to work in the Enterprise together. What Abrams does with this franchise is very similar to what Nolan did with Batman, which also went back to the origins. In this film we have great visual effects, an excellent cast, and a very entertaining story. We kicked off the summer with Wolverine which I enjoyed, but this film makes that one look mediocre. Star Trek has set the standard for the rest of the summer movies to come, and I doubt that they will be able to top this one. This film has it all, it is not just visual effects. Abrams has intelligently renewed the franchise with these talented young actors and I can now say I want to be a Trekky and will look forward to more movies from this franchise. My favorite movie of the year by a long shot so far. There are few movies I can watch over again, but this is definitely one I could see several more times and not get bored. Even if you are not a Star Trek fan like I wasn't, you should go see this film because you will not want to miss out of the best movie of the year so far."
"jeha-2","9","1","4","22 August 2010"," Excellent Movie.....But I Hate Zoe Saldana
","I did enjoy this movie when it first came out in theaters last summer, and also loved how the cast was put together. I thought that Chris Pine was excellent as the new Captain Kirk--a cavalier and handsome womanizer that seduces green women and thinks on his feet. Zachary Quinto was fantastic as the new Spock--he fit the role like a glove and was the logical and cool-headed Spock we have all grown to love, but with a quick temper and he's not afraid to show it. It was also interesting to see the new Spock (Zach Quinto) with the original Spock (Leonard Nimoy) in the same movie! That was pretty cool and to see that Leonard was still the same graceful actor that he has always been. Sulu and Chekov were excellent, and Simon Pegg as Scotty was just hilarious and he was my favorite....as well as Karl Urban as McCoy: he was just like the original McCoy with a little bit of the same attitude that you get with Dr. House. My only problem with this film was Uhura. I cannot stand Zoe Saldana at all: she's not particularly pretty or talented. She completely ruined Uhura for me by being this frigid bitch with a stuck up attitude and a Barbarella boot in her ass. I understand her wanting to make Uhura more assertive and authoritative, but she was completely wrong about the way she approached it, and instead made Uhura stuck-up, cold and bitchy, and seemed kind of useless aboard the Enterprise. The original Uhura used her technical skills to save the ship from crisis, while the new one basically just looks and acts frosty, and then goes and slobbers all over Spock. If I had been the director, I would have called her agent and replaced her within two days. <br/><br/>The special effects were excellently done, with great technical skill and none of the campy and cheap retro FX from yesteryear. and it was a great reboot of the franchise, and it'll be interesting to see what JJ Abrams will do next."
"eric262003","9","1","4","7 June 2010"," A New Trek Here To Stay
","Here's a summer blockbuster, saturated in exciting adventures, hypnotic action, and intriguing characters and performances that will keep you glued to your seat. While this new adaptation may arouse the Trekkie fans all around, it successfully sets the tone for a thought-provoking prequel to the TV series and a potential run for future sequels. <br/><br/>Opening scenes starts with a bang as we follow two young Starfleet officers Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine) and his faithful Vulcan assistant Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) as they join forces to recruit medical officer Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban), communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsman Mr. Sulu (John Cho), wisecracking Russian prodigy Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and chief engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg)to their gravitational field. While this is just the scratch of the surface, the plot goes way beyond the origins of gathering recruits to run the U.S.S. Enterprise. <br/><br/>For gurus of the original 1960's series and the movie series from 1979-1991, this movie is reeling in history like the appearance of Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood)as he expresses mutual admiration for Admiral Archer (reminiscent to the Enterprise series)and the symbolic Kobiyashi Maru hold Kirk utilized in ""The Wrath of Khan"". Granted, some of the cast don't always deliver their performances deadpan to the characters of the original TV series, but I was willing to accept that knowing it wouldn't happen, but but the storyline gives them the liberty to change things around and they accomplish that feat admirably. <br/><br/>Karl Urban pays homage to Deforest Kelly's Dr. McCoy through his personality and quirks. Let's not forget Simon Pegg's Scotty's gleeful characteristic was portrayed with sheer brilliance. Zachary Quinto was absolutely perfectly cast as Mr. Spock which we've grown to love in the 1960's and successfully utilizes the many traits that the Vulcan's possess and even has the opportunity to stand face to face with the original Spock (Leonard Nimoy)<br/><br/>As for the characters of Sulu, Chekov and Uhura, they manage to have their fun in the sun, but the actors (Yelchin, Cho and Saldana) shed a different light to the characters from the 1960's series but didn't tamper them too much. I felt sorry for Chris Pine not performance wise, but because he has a tough act to follow as the new Capt. Kirk and to take the helm of carrying the movie. It must have been tough to follow the quirks and personality of William Shatner that might be impossible to duplicate. Therefore, Pine must rely on his own traits that make him unique. <br/><br/>The heroes of the Enterprise shine in their roles immaculately, the villains here are equally special and play it by heart. Eric Bana as the Romulan leader Nero was a convincing character being that he's not out to do evil for fun, he's in turmoil and yearns his turmoil to those who put him this way. The complexity of this character is obvious, but Bana adds that spark that goes beyond the typical Trekkie villain. <br/><br/>The new design of the Enterprise is a fascinating look and the layout seems functional and quite snazzy. The backbones of the NCC-1701 is a curious discovery with the piping and electrical equipment. We get to explore how maintenance is handled on the ship with the smaller people working behind the main control room.<br/><br/>The musical score by Michael Giacchino which compliments the opening scenes as the dark overtones and logos and goes on a tear in the opening action scenes. But when the undertones are backed by the voice-over we're all too familiar will bring you back in time to the original series like the way Alexander Courage did it."

","A part of me resisted watching JJ Abrams's take on Gene Roddenberry's classic series. Being a fan since I was a kid, you get used to seeing William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Co. saving the universe. To me, seeing the series in someone else's hands seemed wrong.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I was glad that I was wrong. In a way, it is a tribute to Roddenberry and the show. Many die-hard fans may stay away, but it should be given a chance.<br/><br/>I had to admit that the special effects, music and plot were fantastic, but it was Nimoy's role as Spock that put a lump in my throat, especially when he meets his younger self (Zachary Quinto, which give Spock a deep edge).<br/><br/>All I can say is to give this film a chance."

","I went and saw this movie with great expectations, and I wasn't completely disappointed. But I felt that somehow the movie was made with a general vision of transforming the franchise to a more contemporary and not so geeky setting. Which has been done. The problem is that it's not enough. You need to have a good, engaging story that makes sense and characters that you really care about and that also fits the vision.<br/><br/>Instead we here have a story that could have been an episode on TNG and characters that would fit in a Steven Seagal movie.<br/><br/>The movie survives thanks to tempo and excellent CGI. Nothing else."
"Freddy_Boy","8","1","4","25 September 2009"," Great reboot of the Star Trek Universe.
","My father usually described Star Trek very simply: ""When the camera shakes stuff happens"". I'm guessing even he will stand in awe upon this action-oriented Star Trek movie.<br/><br/>While I'm by no means a trekkie I still consider myself somewhat more educated in the Star Trek trivia than your average TV-viewer.<br/><br/>So for me it was kind of hard watching the first half of the movie seeing some rather large plot events went with current lore and status of the Star Trek universe. I was under the impression that this actually was a prequel.<br/><br/>However, as it turned out, this is a reboot. And that's very fortunate because it's a great one at that.<br/><br/>Chris Pine is a great James T. Kirk. He got the smug look and the over-the-top confidence to match. He reminds me a bit more of the early work of Shatner during the first series.<br/><br/>Howver, the real star here, I would dare say is Zachary Quinto who nails Spock. When he first appeared on screen I wondered what kind of plastic surgery Leonard Nimoy went through only to realize that it's really not him. This is just Spock.<br/><br/>What's even greater is that Quinto not only portrays the character Spock but develops him further. He really turns Spock into his own, not only striving to ""play him like Nimoy"".<br/><br/>Other names involved Eric Bana, Chris Hemsworth, Karl Urban and John Cho really delivers. Especially the otherwise over-the-top humoristic John Cho gives us a slightly more advanced Sulu. Again, more action-oriented, but never-the-less Sulu.<br/><br/>In all this new, rebooted, crew really delivers and honor the predecessors. The only one that I'm still uncertain about is Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov. However something tells me he will grow into character.<br/><br/>I expect great things of the Star Trek reboot. The cast is young and the action scenes are great. There's plenty of time to develop this into a new batch of series.<br/><br/>Hopefully we'll get to see more of J.J Abrams and his new Star Trek."

"kazimer66-1","9","1","4","11 September 2009"," Enjoyed the Reboot except
","Loved Mr.Abrams new vision and how he integrated it with the existing franchise.<br/><br/>Biggest complaint was the Kobyashi Maru scene where Kirk was strutting around beating the program. Very much an out of character moment in my opinion. The scene could have played better had Kirk taken the simulation very seriously and upon his success we saw Spock and the observers shocked and puzzled as to how he managed to win. Then the controversy and investigation after the fact would have more resonance to the viewer.<br/><br/>Kirk would not give away that he cheated the simulation but also wouldn't deny he did it when confronted. That to me, seemed more like the Kirk style rather than the strut he had during it. He's a cocky character, but not stupid! The only other complaint was yet ANOTHER revenge story as the point of conflict for this Trek film. It's been done too many times before and let's face it Nicholas Meyer did the definitive Star Trek revenge film back in 1982! Something fresh next time please!"

","Spock getting it on with Uhura? Vulcan blown to eternity? McCoy a young drunk?

The bottom line is that the movie is a blast. <br/><br/>But.......<br/><br/>I thought young Spock looked like Ben Stiller in a made-for-Fox spoof. No one is Leonard Nimoy, but I wanted to laugh each time this guy was on screen.<br/><br/>The explanation of how ""old"" Spock enters the movie was a bit contrived (yeah, I know, calling anything ""contrived"" in a Star Trek movie is dumb) and you probably need to watch the flick twice to ""get it"".<br/><br/>The Eric Bana character was Khan revisited, and Ricardo Montalban's camp was sorely missed.<br/><br/>The script, at times, was a re-hash of multiple ST TV and past big screen plot lines.<br/><br/>But.... <br/><br/>I still enjoyed the film immensely. I am old enough to vividly remember the pilot and the TV seasons. I faithfully watched each movie and The Next Generation was never as good as the original. <br/><br/>So.....<br/><br/>Even a flawed, sometimes dumb and contrived (that word again) reboot is just plain fun. Leonard Nimoy could bring dignity to anything, and his presence in the film, regardless of the weakness of the script line, is terrific.<br/><br/>Let's face it; being in love with a series that was canceled 40 years ago is not rational to begin with!!

","There are a lot of fans of TOS that aren't going to like this movie. (Vulcan gets destroyed!?! Uhura and Spock? WHAT!?) I remember watching this show when I was a kid and desperately wanting a Tribble. But I really enjoyed this movie. There where flaws to be sure but they were of the more forgivable sort. The story was a little bit thin but I give them major credit for giving a reason as to why everything was different. What I enjoyed the most about the movie was the acting. I thought everyone did a wonderful job even if they played up Pavel's accent a little too much. (I know they did in TOS but I complained about it then, as well.) Everyone was very well cast. The special effects were great as well and I loved seeing the Enterprise for the first time. Granted, I can't help but think, ""Why does everything in the universe happen to Kirk and Spock? Did it really have to be Kirk's dad's ship that Nero destroyed? Did Spock really have to be the one he blamed for the destruction of his home world?"" I thought this was a well done movie and accomplished it's goal, which was to make Star Trek more mainstream. It works well because while I think most fans while enjoy it, it also appeals to lagers audiences. That's mainly because most people know of Star Trek. They know ""Beam me up, Scotty"", even if that wasn't the actual line. They know Captian Kirk and Spock.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought this was what George Lucas was trying to do. Which was successfully bring back a series without making too many people mad."

This leads me to believe that a lot of ""Trekkies"" felt the urge to rip holes in the storyline and performances.<br/><br/>Yes there are massive holes in the details of red matter and the motives behind some of the vendettas held, but please don't tell me the original was true to life and logic. YOU MUST BE HAVING A LAUGH! Most Scifi films have flaws, but they are enjoyable as forms of escapism.<br/><br/>THIS FILM ROCKS because of this. It is after all, the first of what will be a long series, no doubt. The characters were established and the actors brought there own personalities along with aspects of there older selves. As this is technically the first film of a new franchise, it has set the scene very well for future additions.<br/><br/>This is a film for a new generation, people in this world need more than a painted cardboard box as a control station and they need actors they can associate with and that is what this film achieves.<br/><br/>The plot may not be the strongest, but the effects and characters more than made up for this, there was more humour in this than many comedies I have seen of late.<br/><br/>Roll on the next and many more to come!"

","On the scale of fast paced engaging entertainment, the Star Trek 2009 not only excels but it also did the nearly impossible job of saving the the venerable Star Trek franchise from the abyss, at least in terms of future commercial projects. With the unpleasant exception of Anton Yelchin playing Chekov, the new cast were convincing in reinterpreting the original ST characters while Lenonard Nimoy deftly played the mature Spock in what could of been a mere cameo. Unfortunately Yelchin's annoying cardboard characterization of Chekov was a minor oversight compared to the major oversight in the film; that being the unbelievable storyline that allowed the franchise to be 'rebooted'. Time travel has always been one of more popular devices in Sci-Fi, especially in the Star Trek universe but in this case, they ended up sacrificing credulity. One doesn't need to be a hardcore trekkie to understand that the first and continuing imperative of the future Spock character would be to restore the original timeline yet he accepts the destruction of his home planet and the alternate timeline as a fait accompli. There were other events in the movie that likewise strained credulity and resulted in the morphing of Star Trek into an even more cartoonish version of itself, but overall the movie is satisfying and hopefully the franchise will live longer and prosper as a result."

","The Setup: Here we have a series that frowns on misuse of cannon and a fan base that would kill for it. Here we have an established series that does not pretend to be great and admits that it has had poor incarnations but also great ones. Here we have a series that missed the generation that could relate to the techno babble and grabbed the generation that could only fantasize about it. Here We Have Star Trek! The Pull: So JJ was cited as saying he was never a trek all star. Well if that is the case lets make that the rule rather than the exception. For those of us who missed the Trek bus it is just a new experience for those who were on the bus you just got a transfer. Simply put JJ in the span of 1 movie setup a completely different star trek with the same characters while fleshing out these characters based on their original conceptions. The Feel: The movie actually feels more like a bromance/rebels film almost every character is breaking some kind of norm and rebelling against the system in their own way. But the film is obviously as it plays out as homage to the series. What can be taken away from the film and what you hope for: Maybe if I watched it several times i could find a hidden meaning of life or some sort but what I took from the movie personally and what I feel others took from the movie as well was a notion of identity. What I hope is for the universe with out Vulcan be expanded upon as a federation without them would truly be a different beast."

The movie went along well with the original cast of characters, Nero was a good change from what most fans expected, and overall the story carried itself well.

I have not seen a movie where every single actor went above and beyond their expectations since maybe the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>The action was good. It sometimes was a bit overdone with lighting, etc, but overall it was enjoyable and kept the you glued to the seat. Suspense was there, good sound fx and great fighting sequences. Overall a very enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>The length of the movie wasn't too bad neither. I know some of the hardcore fans may whine about it not sticking to the original or it being just an instant copy & paste, but that's the point of living in the 2009 age. You use some of the old, make something new with it. If you can't expect every ""remake"" to not have the director's creative influence upon the story and/or character development.<br/><br/>That said, i'd give this movie a 10, but because I only give 10/10 to movies like The Dark Knight, i have to give this one a 9.7/10 (only allows me to give 9 on vote).<br/><br/>SEE IT AT IMAX!"

With his mannerisms, intonement and posturing, he often did resemble Shatner but definitely made his own Kirk.<br/><br/>Quinto as Spock: Again, not a clone. Definitely a great choice as Spock, especially a youthful Spock who is learning how to be human and Vulcan, merging logic with emotion. Quinto also perfectly puts to use some terrific mannerisms which were made famous by Nimoy.<br/><br/>Urban as Bones: If only DeForest Kelley could have seen this movie... Urban was spot on PERFECT as Bones. Everything he did was an homage to DeForest Kelley. And there was nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>The movie may have failed without them.

Bana as Nero, Greenwood as Pike, Zoe Saldana(excuse me while I drool) as Uhura, Pegg as Scotty, Cho as Sulu, Yelchin as Chekov were all as perfect can be. Leonard Nimoy could just stand around and be given credit for his performance as the elder Spock, but thankfully, he did more than that. I cannot leave this one out, Chris Hemsworth as James Kirk's father was fantastic! For what little time he had in the movie, what a great job of portraying the brave father of a newly born legend! He blew me away.<br/><br/>The brilliant use of current movie making technology gave us hopeful insight to future technology without drawing us back into our ""viewership"" status. To me, the escapism we often seek in movies like this drew me into the very core of this alternate reality created by Gene Roddenberry and revived by J J Abrams. Abrams, who has admitted not being a fan of the TV series(probably because he had other things going on), latched onto all the gimmicks, gadgetry and glory of this ""old friend"" from days gone by and made them new - a ""genesis"" of sorts. The old sounds and old visuals were enhanced and made to feel new. Putting it all together the way everyone did, this was as good as it gets.<br/><br/>My hopes for the next Star Trek movie consist of holding onto the camaraderie and technology with subtle and relative humor, not going overboard for the laughs as old Star Trek sometimes did. That said, I loved all the attempts for laughter in this movie.

Seriously folks it's just that good. For anybody who doesn't know the general outline this new Trek movie works both in and out of the continuity of the original series. Mission: Impossible III director and Alias creator J.J. Abrams resurrects the classic science fiction franchise created by Gene Roddenberry with this feature film that embraces the rich history of the influential television and film series while also exploring some uncharted territory. Heroes star Zachary Quinto assumes the role of the Federation Starfleet lieutenant and Vulcan made famous in the original series by Leonard Nimoy (who also appears in an older incarnation of his original role), Spock, with Anton Yelchin stepping into the role of USS Enterprise navigator Pavel Chekov, Zoe Saldana assuming the role of communications officer Uhura, Simon Pegg keeping the ship in top shape as chief engineer Montgomery Scott (aka ""Scotty""), and Eric Bana tormenting the benevolent space explorers as the villainous Nero. Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle co-star John Cho also boards the Enterprise as Hikaru Sulu, with Chris Pine and Karl Urban assuming the legendary roles of Captain Kirk and Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, respectively.<br/><br/>The summer officially stars here; forget what happened last week, as far as I'm concerned last week's ""bad star"" could have very easily been erased from my memory after watching this. This is everything and more that a Trek fans could have asked for flawless in its execution of its characters, battles and dialogue. Granted if you've never seen an episode of Star Trek in your life (god help you) and you feels repulsed by the very thought of sitting down and watching this movie, don't be. This works equally as well for newcomers as it does for fans flitting in between of spectacular set piece to yet another spectacular set piece the true heart and nature of the film becomes present, the love between Uhura and Spock becomes tender and the as the troubled friendship between Spock and Kirk becomes more prominent even those who fail to see the emotional drive in the series will undoubtedly notice it hear. The main feat that this movie accomplishes, and a one that I doubted it for, is its casting. I mean Karl Urban as Bones, you've gotta be kidding me? Holy crap Karl Urban is Bones. It's that astonishment that left me with shivers as every actor nails each of their performance with grace and passion, even if they didn't look like their TV show counterparts they embody what it means to be that character.<br/><br/>""Live long, and Prosper."" Calling the special effects groundbreaking is a huge understatement; the visuals are exciting, refreshing and filled with such flair you would get from a less competent director. They blend seamlessly within their environments (unlike Wolverine) adding a sense of atmosphere rather than to simply look pretty, this is how you use special effects to tell a story. And what a story it is. If there were ever a series that were devoted to certain the best story possible it would most certainly be the Star Trek series. The plot is crafted with grace and complexity throwing plot twists at us left right and centre and not to mention what could possibly be the greatest cameo of all time by none other than Spock himself. All of which works a charm up against a beautifully orchestrated score that echoes with the same majesty that the film carries. Bringing together what could very easily be the greatest movie this summer.<br/><br/>Those who will nod knowingly (or shiver with excitement) at the appearance of Captain Pike or the reference to dilitheum crystals and those who remember that Sulu can fence will be reassured that any anomalies or inconsistencies with canon are cleverly explained away and by the appearance of one key member of the original cast. Those who are new to the franchise will be reassured that the story is self-contained. They may wonder why people applaud and laugh at a few in-jokes or the inevitable origins moments of first encounters between characters whose future interactions and relationships are as well known as their own (possibly better), but there is so much happening on screen they will not have time to wonder what they are missing. Indeed, there is so much that I have seen it twice already and look forward to seeing it again. I loved it so much I wanted to Vulcan mind meld with it.<br/><br/>Verdict: The best movie of the year? Most likely! The best movie of the summer? Undoubtedly! Star Trek is safe with its properties yet extraordinarily entertaining. Director J.J. Abrams hits it straight out into hyper space. Anyone left reeling after years of not having a Trek film to drool over, your wait is finally over. An epic adventure that deftly captures the spirit of the original series, while succeeding utterly in charting a new course. For my overall rating I give Star Trek an outstanding 5/5."
"das417","9","2","13","9 May 2009"," These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise............
","The USS Enterprise is a cultural icon that has defined not only a generation but the entire idea of science fiction. James T. Kirk, Spock, Sulu, etc., are names that have been handed down through the years to new generations of fans and which stand out as characters as memorable as any other. Star Trek isn't just a show, its a vision of what humanity is capable of. J.J. Abrams has created a miracle by recreating not only the show and characters but also giving a new light to what the vision is. <br/><br/>James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine) is man living with no real purpose in his life. Growing up in Iowa after the death of his father, Kirk has spent his years in rebellion and trouble. One night Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) approaches Kirk with an offer. Kirk's father was a hero who saved the lives of his crew including his family. Pike dares James to follow his legacy and become a Starfleet officer. Kirk himself is not to excited about the idea but he realizes that he wants something in his life and Starfleet may have the answer.<br/><br/>Spock (Zachary Quinto) is a half Vulcan half human growing up on the world of his father. While Kirk is rebelling against the law and his parents, Spock discovers that he has no place among the people of his father due to his heritage. When he discovers that even the science ministers of Vulcan disapprove his blood, he turns down a prized seat in the science academy and joins Starfleet. It is there that he will meet a most unlikely friend.<br/><br/>Kirk soon becomes friends with two of his fellow cadets who have their own reason for joining Starfleet. Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban) quickly befriend Kirk despite his issues with authority and rules. This includes cheating to defeat the infamous Kobayashi Maru Scenario which was designed as impossible to beat. It is this act that catches the attention of Spock who is the creator of the scenario. <br/><br/>Disciplinary actions against Kirk are prevented due to an emergency distress call that quickly mobilizes Starfleet Academy's cadets. Vulcun is under attack and Starfleet his forced to deploy the inexperienced cadets to rescue the Vulcans. Through some rather dubious means, Dr. McCoy is able to bring Kirk on board the Enterprise which is not only Captian Pike's new ship but also recently built and ready for her first mission. A new officer by the name of Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) is finding that his first mission is one of both excitement and danger. Later, an engineer by the name of Scotty (Simon Pegg) will also join the crew to defeat not only a threat to the Federation idea of space time itself.<br/><br/>Star Trek is centered upon not only the story of Kirk and Spock but the idea of time and history. Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future, destroys Vulcan in order to gain vengeance against the future Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy) who he believes is responsible for his world's destruction. Spock himself travels back in time and witnesses not only Vulcan's loss but how his relationship to Kirk began. The destruction of Vulcan cannot be avoided and thus the history that Ambassador Spock knows now no longer exists. The Enterprise of his history is gone and that leaves cadet Kirk and cadet Spock to create a new future.<br/><br/>J. J. Abrams was bold in deciding to create not only a new movie but also a new universe for Star Trek. The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, etc., have been excluded from the history that we have come to know. There is freedom to not only make more movies but also a new history for the Federation. Star Trek needed this and while some will of course disagree, the Star Trek universe was drying up in terms of ideas and interest. The idea of a new universe is not only a sign of creativity but of Star Trek becoming more than what it once was. Star Trek is better than ever before. <br/><br/>9/10"
"darthyagi","10","2","13","8 May 2009"," One of the best of the decade
","Let me start by saying that I have not always liked Star Trek. My wife converted me only a few months ago, but even before that, I had wanted to see this movie.<br/><br/>The anticipation wasn't in vain. Everything about this film from the opening sequences to the end grab you by the Starfleet shirt collar and pulls you in. The camera and special effects make it intense, while the plot makes it fast paced and absorbing.<br/><br/>One of the truly great things about this film is the acting, and the actors. The actors look, sound and act like the original actors, making it feel like you're not watching William Shatner or Leonard Nimoy, but that you're watching Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock. The acting is simply great.<br/><br/>One thing I worried about going into the movie was that they would try to make it too nostalgic. Try to make it too old-school. They didn't. However, they didn't update it too much either. That is one of the most amazing things, one that you will be talking about when you are leaving. Classic lines are used, but not over-used.<br/><br/>This film is Star Trek, so die-hard fans will be giddy with excitement. Less hardcore fans will be enthralled, and there will certainly be folks that will be seeing it, because it is simply an incredible movie."
"TrekkerForever","10","2","13","8 May 2009"," Easily better than any of the Next Generation films!!!
","As a die-hard fan of science fiction, I have been waiting for years for the characters of Star Trek to return and this new film is a blast to watch! 24th century bad guy Nero and Spock prime come back in time to a new alternate universe where the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise meets at Starfleet academy. From there they are called upon their infamous ship to stop Nero at all costs, bringing the crew of the Enterprise to save the world again. I thought this was the most entertaining Star Trek film in decades. The characters we all know and love are back, Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhura, and Checkov are all back and each one gets a little piece of the all out action. This series is back and better than ever before. May this new Trek live long and prosper! This is by far better than any of the Next Generation films, including the overrated First Contact."
"griffolyon12","10","2","13","7 May 2009"," Classic Old School Adventure!
","Star Trek is one of those rarities amongst films nowadays. It is tense, exciting, and emotionally involving all in one. What J.J. Abrams and company have done is reinvigorate the dying Star Trek franchise and have made it better than ever.<br/><br/>Now I'll start by saying I have never been a Star Trek fan, I was always one of the people who'd rather watch Star Wars growing up as opposed to Star Trek. This is by no means to say I hated Star Trek growing up, it just never seemed to truly appeal to me as well as Star Wars did, but I've gotta say, upon viewing this latest Star Trek film I have become a big fan.<br/><br/>The story of Star Trek goes back to the beginnings of the U.S.S. Enterprise, creating an alternative universe to the original Trek series (and I mean that literally). Throughout the film we see exactly how all the things of the classic Star Trek series came to be and watch how James T. Kirk assumes command over the Enterprise.<br/><br/>Star Trek is by far the best film I have seen this year so far. It was wonderfully directed, superbly scripted, and excellent overall. J.J. Abrams deserves a huge pat on the back for taking quite possibly the geekiest franchise of all-time and being able to maintain what the fans have always loved, while also being able to create a film that plays extremely well to the casual audience. The script was terrific, crafted to perfection; it was one of the first sci-fi films in a while to utilize time travel in a unique and intriguing manner. The other stuff, such as the special effects and production design, are all top notch, but the two more things worth mention are the score and the acting. The music by Michael Giacchino is amazing, it manages to capture the beauty of his music from LOST combined with the best of John Williams. Finally the acting in this film was stellar, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto steal the show as Kirk and Spock respectively, though it is Simon Pegg as Scotty who manages to generate the most laughs.<br/><br/>Overall Star Trek was a terrific film. The action within the film was exciting, at times channeling the best of classic adventure films like Indiana Jones, and dare I say it, Star Wars. Though the film's emphasis on its characters draws you into the emotion of the story better than pretty much any other film I have seen this year. Overall Star Trek was amazing, I loved it. The film managed to superbly draw me into its world and instill a sense of childlike wonder in which is a rarity in these days. After it was all over I think Star Trek was awesome and is the best sci-fi adventure film released in the past decade (yes, better than even the Star Wars prequels).<br/><br/>One final mention, the prologue with the U.S.S. Kelvin and then the spacediving sequence, are among two of the finest action sequences I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>I give Star Trek a terrific 10 out of 10!"
"aoloiana","8","2","13","7 May 2009"," clever
","Hi, I came back right now from cinema, first show in Italy. I think the plot of the movie is not wide but it is nice and it is clever way to make room for the reborn of the series. This first movie is only a preparation for the next where we may see ( I hope ) the real new potential. Actors are good and they make their job nicely developing the characters adding them a new smell of modernity. If you see the movie with open mind you cannot be disappointed. As I said before the script and the plot itself are not so great... I can say they are a little bit narrow, so I have expectation for the next step, coming soon,I think. Uhura is beautiful and sexy ( as the modern style requested...), Scott,Sulu,Chekov and Bones are OK but not great, Kirk very good and Spock....awesome! I want to spent a few words for Captain Pike....a really great Bruce Greenwood. Nice to see also the Original Spock. Go to see them and enjoy! Bye and forgive my mistakes (I am Italiannnn!)"
"Howling_Mad_ Murdock","9","2","13","7 May 2009"," Star Trek returns to Warp Speed!
","I must say, as an avid Star Trek fan for most of my life I was very sceptical of this new movie. I felt there had been too many failures by the creative teams in Voyager, the opening 2 years of Enterprise and the previous 2 movies that they should just let things rest a while and then bring in new people.<br/><br/>We've seen so many prequels recently and there have been a lot more failures than successes and thank god they done this one right! It's action from the get-go and the film for the most part is high paced.<br/><br/>Hat's off to Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Ben Cross and Leonard Nimoy who put by far the best performances. Every scene that's has Leonard Nimoy were done wonderfully and a true tip of the hat to classic Star Trek.<br/><br/>The special effects are top-notch and bring a fresh new view of Star Trek. J.J. Abrams was right in saying this isn't for any Star Trek ""purists"", we'll all have to adopt the Star Trek philosophy and keep an open mind for this film in order to truly enjoy it. For example, planet Delta Vega that was in the William Shatner pilot episode for Star Trek, was near the Galaxy's edge. Here, it's almost within a nats wing of the planet Vulcan, you'll just have to let little things like that go.<br/><br/>My only real criticism of the picture was that I thought they overdid the comedy side a bit. I don't mind a few funny bits here and there, but I thought they did too much. Aside from that, it's a good start to build upon and I hope the sequel to this will focus a bit more on the characters just established here now that the base has been set.<br/><br/>Ahead Warp Factor 9!"
"Robert_duder","10","2","14","12 July 2009"," The Ultimate Reboot...an absolutely stunning sci-fi action film that will endear Star Trek to hordes of new fans
","I do enjoy Science Fiction films, but I am far from a Trekkie. Still I have always enjoyed the Star Trek films and thought the new one looked wicked but I never dreamed that it would exceed those expectations and turn the Star Trek franchise into a brilliant reboot that will make legions of new fans. Dealing with a franchise like this is just near impossible let alone trying for perfection and yet the film creators along with director JJ Abrams come as close to perfecting a reboot, redux, remake of Star Trek that anyone could have ever done. They single handedly turn the world's biggest name in Science Fiction into an action powerhouse that creates a whole new amazing cast but still pays an amazing homage to the original series and film. The best part is the film can appeal to anyone, I think that Trekkies can really appreciate it and love the film but the average film goer will love it. Abrams and writer Roberto Orci who has a long list of great films to his credit managed to avoid any judgment on their story by completely changing the Star Trek time line. It might make hard core Trekkies cringe but they can't argue that anything goes when the timeline changes.<br/><br/>Chris Pine leads the young, hot cast as the young, wise cracking, risk taking James T. Kirk. He is a far cry from Shatner's Kirk and takes the character in a completely different direction BUT manages to pay true homage to Shatner with a few one liners delivered with perfect Shatner precision but it does not come across as mocking but rather a respectful shout out to the man that made the role famous. Pine is really terrific and he is sure to jump start a huge Hollywood career with this role. I would have thought out of the entire cast that there was no way anyone could do justice to, or pull off the role of Spock. How wrong could I be? Zachary Quinto is absolutely mind blowing as Spock. The rest of the cast is great but Quinto as Spock gives the performance of his career. Karl Urban breathes life into a young, much less composed Bones. The chemistry between him and Pine is terrific in their respective characters. Zoe Saldana doesn't get quite the screen time as other characters but she does great and I hope they give her character some room to expand in sequels. Simon Pegg is absolutely brilliant as Scotty. The most unfortunate part of his role is that he doesn't join the cast until half way through the film. He isn't over used and in fact you want to see more of him. John Cho and Anton Yelchin round out the cast in small roles and do an equally terrific job. There is one rather weak link to the cast sadly but it doesn't drag the film down at all. Eric Bana is very weak compared to everyone else as the ""evil"" Nero. He just doesn't have a real strong presence and he's not big and bad enough to feel his threatening nature.<br/><br/>I wish I could go on and on about this phenomenal cast. Combined with the constant non-stop action, the brilliant special effects, and the well thought out plot this movie will blow your mind. It was an amazing kick off to the summer blockbusters!! The entire concept of seeing the background of Kirk and the others was the perfect add in for Trek fans or even someone like me with a little knowledge of the Star Trek Universe. Spock is heavily focused on giving Quinto a chance to flourish and he does that with ease. The background and the incredible new story revolving around Spock and his family and The Vulcan people. Also it was truly great the way they added in the significant cameo by Leonard Nimoy playing his legendary role. The role is not forced and actually fits very well. For the record I think Shatner should have been given some sort of cameo. Anyways you must check out Star Trek because I think this is the beginning of a brilliant new series. One of this years best films!! 10/10"
"pete-61","10","2","14","15 June 2009"," Wow.
","I'm surprised to say this movie was great. When I heard it was coming out I had no intention of seeing it in the theater. I heard the only returning cast member was Nimoy who didn't want to do the part. That and the direction that Generations took made me a little iffy. I had many many many many many doubts about it but happily I was not disappointed. Great plot, great cast, great effects. In a nutshell. Well done. I will not disclose any plot details. I will say they did well explaining any differences from the originals. Very well. My wife hates Star Trek. Loved this. Good work, can't wait for the next one. The only complaint that I do have is the amount of screen time Simon Pegg gets, but that was the shame that Scotty always felt. Saves everyone all the time, minimum recognition."
"howard.schumann","8","2","14","15 June 2009"," How two very different people came together
","Blending the past, present, and future of the crew of U.S.S. Enterprise, J.J. Abrams' Star Trek tells us about the origins of Kirk and Spock, the launch of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and how two very different people came together ""to explore new worlds, to seek out new life and civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before."" More action than Sci-fi, the new Star Trek will keep older Trekkies and newer action/adventure fans happy with its scenes of space conflict utilizing state of the art technology while intelligently exploring the qualities required for command. Opening with a dramatic prologue showing James Kirk's birth after his father heroically sacrificed his life to save his crew, the film flashes back to the boyhood of Kirk and Spock to show us the forces that molded them into leadership roles.<br/><br/>In Iowa, the young Kirk (Chris Pine) is depicted as a rebellious teenager who steals and destroys a car but is convinced by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to attend the Starfleet Academy. Star Trek also follows the early days of Spock (Zachary Quinto) who was taunted by bullies on the planet Vulcan because of his half-Vulcan and half-human ancestry. Soon, he too will join Starfleet and it is not long before the tension between him and Kirk manifests - Spock the cool, rational logician, and Kirk, the bold adventurer. Other members of the crew are the comical ship's doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), the alluring Communications Chief Uhara (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), the gregarious engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg), and the seventeen-year old Chekov (Anton Yechin) whose heavy Russian makes him difficult to understand.<br/><br/>The original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, also appears representing a future Spock as an exile on a frozen planet called Delta Vega. Of course, the film must have a villain, and this time it's a tattooed meanie named Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan who travels back in time to fulminate about taking revenge on Federation planets (particularly Vulcan and Earth) because his own planet was accidentally destroyed by Spock. Nero certainly has the tools as demonstrated in the release of drills that create a black hole causing a planet to implode killing millions of people. The threat by Nero causes Kirk and Spock to unite their talents and effectively end the debate over who is better suited for leadership. Together they must save the Federation planets and rescue Captain Pike who is being held hostage by the Romulans.<br/><br/>As the narrative reaches its inevitable conclusion, one can certainly admire the state-of-the-art special effects, the convincing performances, and the entertaining plot that depicts the emergence of a spunky crew learning to work together. Unlike earlier space operas like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, however, there is not much here that one is asked to think about. We are told about the Enterprise's bold mission of space exploration, yet none of that element is present in the film. What we have are the same ""evil"" enemies, the same high-tech wars, and the same triumphalism that Hollywood has been churning out seemingly forever. Indeed, one is tempted to ask why the writers and directors in Hollywood cannot envision an advance in human consciousness to match the advances in technology, or why they cannot picture a future without ugly monsters, hateful villains, and endless conflict, indeed, why they cannot see a universe filled with beauty and wonder and things we have yet to imagine."
"bramb600","10","2","14","15 June 2009"," Not just for Trekkie's!!!
","This movie completely blew my socks off. Coming in to the movie, I had no knowledge of anything Star Trek related. I never saw any of the series or any of the movies, simply because it never interested me. I hate hearing all that technobabble that always is going to give me a headache because it's filled of all these imaginary space words.<br/><br/>So since I'm new to the series, I have to say I was skeptical about this movie because I thought it was going to be the same thing. This is being called a reboot and gosh darn it delivers on that promise because it completely brings a totally dead franchise back to life, a franchise that I never cared for but I want a sequel all of a sudden.<br/><br/>I like this because it related to me. When I knew about the TV Series it was people that were in space, I never considered the fact that they might be from Earth. But, this movie set that up that it is their homeland, so I am able to imagine actually going on the Enterprise.<br/><br/>The actors talk so modern too and it feels so natural. It was almost if JJ Abrams filmed real people in the role and didn't force anything. That's perfect casting all around.<br/><br/>This has to have had the best soundtrack of the year. Very, very catchy score. I await for another Star Trek movie and have become a Trekkie. I am also now a fan of director JJ Abrams so make more movies because they are exceptional."

Sounds like a lot of people haven't even sit and watched the movie.<br/><br/>""Oh, and did I mention that every character in TNG, DS9 and Voyager and Enterprise is dead? Oh, not dead. NEVER BORN! That's right, Picard and Data, will never exist. Never born. Because the time-line has been re-arranged."" Come on, didn't your years of growing fat on you parents couch tell you anything about fictional time travel, and fictional parallel universes to know you will still be alive, just not the same, or at the least not the same in a parallel universe? ""This new movie is not the Star Trek that we know and have loved for more than 40 years, is in fact a poor excuse to gain market and to reboot (erase) the series completely."" This one seems like the guy is well past 40. Back when movies usually involved some guy on a horse ""make believing"" what the west was like. On the other hand, there were some good thrillers for the time. Today they would seem like an average movie with extremely tight budget compared to the thrillers/horror movies today (I don't remember if they called horror movies horror back then or if thrillers was the term of the time).<br/><br/>I thought the movie added a new saga to Star Trek, being it is based in an alternate universe. Oh and the part about going forward to prevent the destruction of Romulas, and Nero from seeking revenge, let's just say, their attempt to do so would alter the time line even worse farther down the line from there. For example, Nero and his wife would probably not even meet, or/and Spock may decide not to even mention the attempt to save Romulas. But non of the comments are from people who have actually studied Quantum Theory, and the lately termed Quantum Physics, or so they seem to not be from such people.<br/><br/>Just for the record, I have watched the movie, and I thought it rocked in the usual Star Trek fashion. I know how the movie seems at first with time travel, and such things. Everyone is going to complain about something, let mine be the design of the Enterprise bridge. Although I did like the design, it didn't look anything like the pilot for the original series (when Chris Pike was captain). It would have given more authentication in the time line if such had been the case, but for younger generations, it would've put the movie back a dozen decades (being they would know little about TOS, if anything at all)."

","When Paramount Pictures decided to move the release date of Star Trek from Christmas 2008 to May 2009, I shared the same frustration that a lot of nerds around the world must have felt. It had been almost four years since any new production with the name Star Trek, and hunger was rising.<br/><br/>So, after a much longer wait than I wanted, I bought my Gold Lounge ticket and hoped that it had been worth it.<br/><br/>The action was immediate. From the very start, the films look and tone were completely unlike anything seen in Star Trek before, but yet it was still Star Trek. When viewed in the context of where the film fits into the Star Trek universe, I'd have to say that it can be watched after the conclusion of all the previous productions, but still serve as a prequel to the Original Series. There are many things in the story that change what has been established before, but after a lot of thought, can also be made to fit.<br/><br/>There are moments in the film that reminded me of watching one of the Bourne series of films, with camera shaking and fast paced shots used to ramp up the excitement level, but thankfully it's kept to a minimum. The battle scenes are incredible and very different from anything seen in Star Trek, or even Star Wars, before. The rest of the film is visually amazing, the special effects are top notch and don't appear corny.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the unexpected humor, there were several points in the film where I laughed at how this new crew would remind me of their old characters. The new actors fit very nicely together, working well as a group but also with individual performances that honored the original crew. I give top marks to Karl Urban for his performance as Dr McCoy, Bruce Greenwood makes an awesome Captain Pike and Zachary Quinto does well at portraying a very young, emotional Spock, managing to break out of the mold of Sylar from Heroes. Eric Bana as the villain Nero is bad ass, Simon Pegg is A lot of fun as Scotty, and I hope he gets more time in the sequel. Anton Yelchin as Checkov sounded OK-ish, but can get a little annoying, a lot like Wesley Crusher in Star Trek - The Next Generation.<br/><br/>The film also features an appearance of Leonard Nimoy as a very old Spock. In keeping with continuity, I was pleased he was referred to as Ambassador Spock, which is what he last was in an episode of Star Trek - The Next Generation. The events which lead him to being included in the story were a little vague, but I guess we only have a two hour film and not an entire series to get through. Suffice to say that his role brings the film to a point where it can be viewed either as a reboot of the franchise, or a continuation of it from Star Trek - Nemesis, the most recent film before this one. I think that will be up to the fan to decide.<br/><br/>Things I especially loved were the music which bought a tone of the older films to this one, and also made parts of the movie very emotional. I loved the pulse phasers on the Starfleet ships instead of one long continuous beam. The Kobyashi Maru scene was funny and great to watch, even featuring a brief appearance of old style Klingon ships. And the Starfleet uniforms are just plain cool, even having little Starfleet symbols sewn into the material. I even caught a reference by Scotty to Admiral Archer and his prized beagle, a nice piece of continuity from Star Trek - Enterprise.<br/><br/>Some things I didn't like were the ships engine rooms, looking very much like the engine room from the film Titanic, the transporter seemed to take A lot longer than it did in the show, and didn't seem as reliable. Chris Pine as James Kirk came off as arrogant, and his forgiveness by Starfleet and promotion to Captain seemed a little forced, kind of playing to the expectations of the audience rather than him rising to become Captain. Also, some of the sound mixing seemed VERY over the top.<br/><br/>On the whole, J.J. Abrams has bought Star Trek back to life and has remained faithful to the elements of the old show. Faced with enormous expectations from a huge fanbase, the writers have created a great new story they can enjoy while appealing to new fans, and have set the film up for either a sequel or to be viewed just before watching The Original Series. It's an amazing piece of cinema and so much fun to watch."

","This film was a awesome thrill ride that was never dull. I only had basic knowledge of previous Star Trek incarnations and I have to say this was very entertaining to me a not so educated Star Trek viewer. I think the balance for loyal Trekkies and people new to Start Trek will please everyone. The Chemistry between the characters was excellent. The film was cast very well, with Zachary Quinto leading the way in a stand out performance of Spock. I will definitely see this film again. So if your a Trekkie or not I would still recommend this to anyone, hope this is useful<br/><br/>So far this is the best film I have seen at a cinema this year"

","Went into a preview showing this morning half excited half worried on what they had done with the Star Trek universe. I didn't need to worry, it was truly great entertainment. Excellent set action pieces The story flowed from one piece of excitement to another with incredible special effects. These bits of CGI not only looked beautiful but not once did you say to yourself ""Oh look its badly done CGI"". But unlike the Star Wars prequel films these special effects did not overtake the film they were just there to tell the story.<br/><br/>The music score was very enjoyable especially the final few minutes of the film. I was very impressed with the direction and the acting was excellent from actors who are relatively unknown.<br/><br/>Will be seeing the film again and bring on the sequel."

","I just saw this movie and I just thought I'd do some gushing because right now I'm on a buzz. I never watched the TV show but I am familiar with these characters as is anyone who doesn't live in a black hole. Anyway to make a long story short, it's a breath of fresh air. The actors are perfect, the effects are great (they just seamlessly blend into the movie though - the main focus is on the characters) and there's plenty of humor. I know some of the posters have been criticizing the casting in this film but you people are so, so wrong. Chris Pine is terrific, as is Zachary Quinto...in fact, there is no weak link in the cast I can identify at all. There's excellent action and the film has a very fast pace. I saw a comment on the Star Trek message board about how there is too much talking and not enough action and I'd just like to say that's baloney. There's loads of action and the dialogue is sharp, witty and to the point. The movie flows brilliantly from start to finish and there is rarely (never in this posters eyes) a dull moment. The movie feels like an introduction to what will hopefully be a wildly successful franchise. I left the movie theatre feeling uplifted and brimming with optimism."

","I wasn't a huge fan of Star Trek growing up though I did watch some episodes of The Next Generation in the early 1990s. I also played the graphic adventure game entitled 25th Anniversary and won it. I'd only seen parts of the feature films and a little of Generations but this was the first Star Trek movie I enjoyed. Sure, it's a reboot but a fun reboot and it's one of my favorite remakes along with 1999's The Mummy. All-new cast and more background for Kirk and the rest of the gang, and they pulled it off splendidly. Because of this movie, I'm now a Star Trek fan though I'm not a huge fan but I will watch episodes of The Next Generation and as of now I've watched the first four feature films. My favorite sci-fi features now are Star Wars (my number one), Star Trek (which puts the ""science"" in science-fiction), StarGate (which mixes history and mythology with sci-fi), and finally StarCraft (Blizzard's major sci-fi game franchise). JJ Abrams, you did it!"

","When this movie came out I went to watch it with zero expectations. I was by no means a Star Trek fan and I had really no idea what it was about. But J.J. Abrams really accomplished something with this film, I really mean that, because he took a franchise that had been through good and bad, through better and worse and made an extremely entertaining film that served as a great introduction to the Star Trek universe and its characters, while also trying to keep life-long fans happy. And I know there were some trekkies who were disappointed the time line was messed with, but the truth is the movie is very well made, with great effects and great action. I know some people that don't like the lens flare effect J.J. likes to use in his films, but to me it really seems it makes the film more real and vivid. I really like the casting choices, as well and pretty much every actor is solid. There are a few things that bother me, though. Some of the dialogue in the movie and certain things that happen are really only there for the sake of nostalgia and exposition. And I'm talking as a non-fan, so I'm sure there were one or two things I missed there. However, Star Trek is a very entertaining action movie that serves as a great introduction to Star Trek."
"Tweekums","8","1","5","17 October 2011"," Rebooting a sci-fi classic
","Having first watched 'Star Trek' as a child in the early seventies then watching the films and various new series I was unsure about having a different cast play the original characters after all William Shatner IS James T. Kirk! This film manages to get around that by being set before he is made captain of the Enterprise... in fact the opening scene takes place just before he is born. In that opening scene is father sacrifices himself so that the crew of his ship, including his pregnant wife can escape after an attack by a giant Romulan ship. The Young James Kirk grows up to be a bit of a tearaway but is persuaded to join Star Fleet by Captain Pike. At the end of his time at Star Fleet Academy he is in trouble for cheating in a test but an incident on Vulcan means that everybody including the cadets must head there straight away. Once they arrive they find the rest of the fleet has been destroyed and Vulcan is under attack from the Romulans. Once they have finished there the Romulans set off towards their next target: Earth. Pike has been captured so it is up to Kirk, Spock and the other characters we know from the original series to prevent a catastrophic attack on Earth.<br/><br/>I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this; I suspect this is because the cast don't seem to be trying to imitate the original cast too closely. There is also a lot more humour than I expected and also a few shocks... I certainly didn't expect to see the destruction of Vulcan or the tragic loss of somebody close to Spock. The story itself was pretty good and the use of time-travelling Romulans to create an alternate time line means that any future instalments in the franchise won't be bound by what we know happened from the original series. The cast did a decent job, especially Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock; the rest of the crew may have been there but it was essentially the story of how Kirk and Spock became close despite their very different personalities. The bad guys were suitably villainous even if they didn't look like most Romulans that we have seen before and the action and special effects were impressive enough to keep this viewer gripped. I started watching the as a sceptic but now look forward to seeing further adventures with this cast."
"MovieGuy109","6","1","5","23 August 2011"," Star Trek is decent entertainment for all its junk.
","The Star Trek franchise has become a sensation across the globe and now TV Producer J.J Abrams comes out with a prequel to the franchise with modern special effects and modern actors to play the classic parts. A good idea, but Abrams does not really achieve his goal. I was bored more than enthralled by the storytelling. Zachary Quinto is good as Spock, a highlight of the otherwise ineffective reboot. The visuals are good with lots of neat insights on the famous franchise, but Abrams adds a lot of unneeded stylized crudeness and action scenes that do not really attain to the plot. It's not bad, but when you get down to it, only Star Trek junkies will give it the time of day."
"RecurringNightmare","5","1","5","8 June 2011"," I have problems with several plot points.
","I have several glaring problems with the plot. I do demand that movies I watch at least try to make some sense, and not many people seem to have noticed these which I will point out.<br/><br/>1. Spock Ejects Kirk from the Enterprise. Does the starship not come with a brig? What does Spock think will happen to his career if he ejects a cadet onto a barely livable ice ball where he is bound to be eaten by one of several large predators?<br/><br/>2. Just so happens.. Out of an entire planetary body we would assume is at least the size of our moon, Kirk Just So Happens to land a couple of miles from where Spock is hiding in a cave and he Just So Happens to run in the random direction of that cave and then encounter Spock.<br/><br/>3. Who are the two very unlucky Romulans in the giant laser drill? What exactly is their job inside there? It looks to be a very precarious and highly dangerous job that must be totally necessary otherwise these two jokers would stay up on the big ship. Honestly I wouldn't want to be inside any kind of mechanism that's dropped 200 miles from orbit into a planet's atmosphere and then periodically spews flames because its getting so hot from the amount of energy it's discharging.<br/><br/>4. The entire mechanism of the giant laser drill and black hole bomb is totally unnecessary. Are you saying that if you created a black hole on the surface of the planet nothing would happen? Trust me, the black hole would eat everything up, maybe just a little slower, and you don't need some elaborate tunnel deep into the core of the planet to do it.<br/><br/>5. Do Vulcan and Earth not have an Air Force? So this giant laser drill is hanging there in the sky blasting the planet for apparently a couple hours or so. Are there NO atmospheric fighter jets anywhere around? A 400 year old F-15 and one missile could have saved the day. A shuttle with a welding laser. A surface to air missile. Randy Quaid drunk in his F-18 from Independence Day crashing into it.<br/><br/>Are you saying that this thing can hang over San Fran and nobody is going to send up a squad of fighters to blow it away and we have to wait helplessly for some starship outside the atmosphere to show up?<br/><br/>And then there was the spot that the drill was firing at on Earth which was into a bunch of water. The exact worst possible spot to try to use a laser drill oh never mind. None of it makes any sense.<br/><br/>6. Spock needs an Astronomy 101 class. So the back story of why old Spock needs a black hole bomb in the first place is that there is some supernova that is going to blow Romulus up and they need the black hole bomb to ""absorb"" it. Now I'm not an astrophysicist, but I did take plenty of astronomy classes as I'm sure many Trek fans have.<br/><br/>A supernova is a star blowing up. If it is a star outside the Romulus star system, then, even if the shock wave moves at the speed of light, and that star is right next door to Romulus, then you have at least 4 years before it arrives at Romulus (about the closest distance stars are to each other in this part o the galaxy.) More than likely, you'd have a hundred years heads up because shock waves from supernovas don't move at the speed of light. Since you have ships that can fly from Earth to Vulcan in about 10 minutes I'd say you should have plenty of time to do whatever you needed, and it wouldn't come down to the last second.<br/><br/>Or, if the star that is blowing up is Romulus' home star, then I don't care what you place in front of it to ""absorb"" the explosion, every planet in the system is done for. The supernova remnant that will be left afterward won't be anything like the star Romulus is used to and nothing on the planet will be capable of living in that radically altered environment. And, incidentally, Romulus would have been engulfed by the star hundreds of years earlier as it grew into a red giant prior to blowing up.<br/><br/>So basically the whole back story is completely impossible, even if we agree that there can be a thing called ""red matter"" that makes black holes and even if you could use this black hole to travel backwards through time. Since its Star Trek I can buy that, but what I can't buy is this very vague and ridiculously unscientific supernova that is going to blow up Romulus.<br/><br/>So maybe most of the movie-going audience doesn't know a galaxy from a star system or a nova from a nebula, sure I guess I can forgive that. But most of the movie-going audience should know that Vulcan and Earth aren't going to sit there helpless without an air force because apparently in the star trek universe the only things that can fly around and do anything useful are star ships. Are you reading this JJ? Next time at least get the plot to make some sense even if you must totally defy all scientific knowledge about space."
"Lejink","8","1","5","24 February 2011"," Start trek
","I'm a first generation ""Star Trek"" fan without being a Trekkie, in fact Patrick Stewart is probably my favourite captain of the Enterprise, the heresy of it, but following in the recent example of the James Bond if not Star Wars franchise, it pays to go back to the start for a fresh beginning.<br/><br/>Naturally therefore there's a good deal of pleasure to be had in watching familiar faces pop up as the story progresses as well as familiar phrases and even surroundings and devices, spruced up with SFX and CGEN for modern consumption. There's attention to detail in continuity,for instance the original ship's Captain Pike ending up in a wheelchair recalling the TV pilot episode ""The Cage"" (okay maybe I am a Trekkie, after all) but are some neat narrative twists too, with young Kirk's pursuit of young Uhura pipped by her having the hots for Spock of all people. The latter-day facsimiles are all fairly with the exception of Simon Pegg's unrecognisable take on Scotty although I guess the casting stays true to the original series in casting anyone but a native Scot to play one of my countrymen.<br/><br/>The story is complicated yet direct enough to engage and hold interest throughout, even if Eric Bana's villain Nero probably isn't quite malevolent enough. As ever there's a race against time to save the earth and a bizarre meeting of past and future Spocks before the natural order is restored of Kirk as captain and Spock as first officer. The action scenes are terrific with hosts of daredevil stunts and there's loads of falling masonry and collapsing planets to feast the eyes on.<br/><br/>Important as these are, the heart of the story is the Kirk / Spock friendship, born in enmity as these things frequently are, as well as the building of the team which would later helm the bridge in future missions to come. <br/><br/>All in all, there's not much to fault here, the resurrection obviously being carried out by admirers of the TV prototype. The sentimentalist in me might have liked to see a few more cameos from some of the surviving cast members, rather than the one rather large part given to a very old and slightly frail Leonard Nimoy, good as it is to see him.<br/><br/>Just a shame to think it'll probably be another year or two for a sequel to arrive, when in the old days all you had to do was wait until next week for the next episode..."
"Hinosan417","6","1","5","14 February 2010"," Good action plus inane details equals still good movie
","This was a very unusual movie for me because I did find it entertaining on the one hand, but also very annoying in its frequent lack of common sense and respect for its genre. Looking just at the entertainment value, one could certainly give the film a 7 or 8 for action that moves along well, relatively engaging characters and a script free of the heavy Trek-jargon that often weighs down television episodes. However, as a science fiction fan I found many details of the film just plain silly. I'm sure a hardcore Trek fan could cite dozens of gaffs, but one of the more obvious is the construction of the Enterprise - a very large ship not designed to operate in an atmosphere - on the surface of the Earth rather than in orbit; also bizarre were starships maneuvering mere meters away from a ""black hole"" without being torn apart by gravity ~ the sort of detail that makes one wonder if the black hole in question was actually meant to be wormhole but was renamed a ""black hole"" to sound more ominous. One idea that I do like (actually implied in the script) is that this movie is set in a parallel universe quite distinct from the original Star Trek, and I think the very action of the movie ~ tampering with history for the sake of vengeance ~ would make it easier to free oneself from attachment to the background of classic Trek if one is a die-hard fan. But even so, Kirk's ultimate reward for his heroism (let me avoid a spoiler) is out of all proportion to his gallingly inappropriate conduct at Starfleet Academy. A basically good movie? I guess. But compromising between an 8 for brisk action and a 4 for many flaws in logic and common sense, I offer a 6 instead. The odds are, most viewers will be entertained."

","Yes, at times the movie was fun. But I had some problems with the movie.<br/><br/>1) Why's the villain so peeved? He now has the power to stop the event that made him so angry, kill himself, and wait to be reborn. Alternately, Spock now can gets there in time, and the villain never gets mad, and never goes back in time to alter the universe.<br/><br/>2) Kirk's rebellious ""Bad Boy"" is WAY over the top. He goes from one A*Hole moment to another. Anyone who likes him, I believe, is projecting the James T. Kirk we all know. But that one no longer exists. His father didn't meet the same fate, etc., etc."

I think Pine did a fine job as Kirk, a likable character, and Quinto did look like Spock, at some angles. And finally it was ""fun"" to watch.<br/><br/>That said, I have to stay loyal to my trekker comrades with their comments. There was just something missing. If the idea was to start from scratch, then why not introduce a new villain (and I mean a new species). If there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy, and 1 trillion galaxies, surely a new life-form villain, with likable characteristics, would have been a LOGICAL and FASCINATING (sorry, had to add that) concept to watch.<br/><br/>I too agree that time-travel was a cheap way to RESET the whole universe.

"JRmf","9","1","5","3 November 2009"," Excellent reinterpretation of the old story
","The new Star Trek gets a 9/10 from me, a confirmed sci-fi geek, for sheer entertainment and interest value - a rollicking good story - solid linking to its heritage and great sci-fi.<br/><br/>No expense seems to have been spared to make this the most visually stunning Star Trek ever. CGI really helps provided a solid story is in place, as it was here. The idea of creating a planet-destroying black-hole by releasing a tiny quantity of ""red matter"" at its core was intriguing. The actual sequence took 14 seconds - I would have liked it to take slightly longer, maybe as much as 30, and to have been viewed in close-up or with flashes of those experiencing it.<br/><br/>There are some nitpicks: Checkov is able to lock onto two bodies falling at terminal velocity (maybe 200 km/hr) and successfully beam them back, yet he lost Spock's mother when the cliff under her crumbled, despite him having a lock on her to begin with. When Scotty rushes to eject the core, instead of the usual dilithium-core engine room, he enters something resembling an oil refinery area.<br/><br/>I personally liked the younger, slimmer Uhura. And at last, we see a Star Trek man going down on an attractive female, though quite green and apparently not human. Much better than Jonathan Frakes reveling in holographic, harp-playing ladies - does the man have no testosterone?? One day we might even get to see an extended love scene..<br/><br/>This Star Trek is very different from the previous movies - which can get a bit staid - or even the TV series. Purists may weep, but what would they prefer, a ""strict"" adherence to the past and a slow death from lack of patronage? It's broken out of a mainly SF geek appeal and widened the latter to a much broader, and especially younger, audience. Its youthful pitch and pace, if maintained, will ensure the franchise survives for decades to come."

Fans of Star Trek (like myself, yes I'm that much of a nerd) will find this movie absolutely hysterical. Unfortunately the plot is rather serious and over-dramatic, but who cares. I mean they blew up (SPOILER ALERT) the planet Vulcan, killed Spock's Mom, and crumpled up the Trek Timeline and tossed it out the window. It's like a strange attempt at DC's Crisis events, except they were too lazy to try and make it work. But that's okay, through accident or intention, they've made an excellently funny movie. From Kirk getting caught with the green girl to Simon Pegg playing Mr. Scott, this is comedy gold from start to finish. Sometimes it does get a bit silly, but then, the movie couldn't quite figure itself out from the start anyway, so once you've established that this silliness can go anywhere, it's time to sit back, relax, and laugh yourself stupid. er.

When I watched this movie, I only had a vague idea of the characters, and watched the earlier movies of the first generation since watching this movie. Have you ever been interested in knowing the life of a celebrity before they became what they are? This Star Trek movie introduces you to the life of the first generation crew, ending when the crew of the USS Enterprise comes together as we know it. Though it is a fictitious piece of work which has been conceived and written several years after the earlier movies, it somehow seems as if the movie is actually a biography of the characters. Most of the details from the earlier movies are well tied in, and there are certain jokes about the characters too; and if something doesn't make sense, don't worry... Star Trek crew changes the future every so often! ;). If you have not followed Star Trek, but like Science Fiction action movies, this is a very good one too.

","Firstly, the look of Star Trek is every bit as awesome (and more) as I could have expected – both the interior and exterior scenes are breathtaking. The look of the film helps build the bridge between our time and the 23rd Century deep rooting some fundamental likenesses, making the viewer feel more at home (which is a clever tool). Likewise is the re-vamped world of Star Fleet; the ships, the uniforms – all scenes showing suitable respect for the original without looking dated and merging perfectly with new and shinier glimpse of the future. The Enterprise is given a massive boost in scale, showing enormous shuttle bays, an engine room the size of a football pitch and bustling corridors of furious activity. Even the bad guys, namely the Romulans have had a re-branding and now look every bit the menacing, xenophobic warrior race they were always made out to be. This is before we get into the special effects and CGI which is absolutely flawless in every respect.<br/><br/>Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are great respectively as Kirk and Spock, bringing new and edgy depth to probably the most well known science fiction characters ever created and really getting the best out of them, which is no easy task. The on-screen chemistry between the two works really well as you get a real feel for the characters deep bond and friendship for each other which was so well documented in Treks gone by. A favourable nod also to Karl Urban who plays Dr. Bones McCoy, taking real inspiration from DeForest Kelly's characterisation and manages to capture the essence of the character without running the risk of mimicking too much or making the performance cheesy. Also impressive is John Cho as Sulu who gets a real opportunity to shine and gets in on some of the action sequences, again bringing a freshness to the to the role and creating his own interpretation of the Enterprise helmsman without relaying too much on the original character. Zoe Saldana who plays the new Ohura brings some sex appeal and sass to the bridge of the Enterprise, but has little to do except be intergalactic eye candy. Then onto Anton Yelchin as Chekov who despite a lively performance is turned into little more than an annoying parody of the original ('Kiptin, therrre isa wessel apprrroaccchhhing' – you get the idea!) . the real losers in all of this are Simon Pegg and Eric Bana; Pegg gets relegated to the final third of the movie as Chief Engineer Scotty and despite being funny and charming never quite gets the opportunity to cement himself as more than just the comedy relief and Bana's performance is not going to get him into the history books as Trek's most fearsome baddie.<br/><br/>So that was the style, unfortunately the substance leaves a lot to be desired. The plot is a flimsy and lazy recycling of stuff we have seen umpteen times before, the story to is clumsy, putting all of it's faith into a clunky time travel scenario which has some major, major holes (black holes if you will!) which undermines the whole thing enough to leave it constantly playing catch up with itself. To the more experienced Trekkie and movie goer this comes across as nothing more than a blatant attempt to re-write the Trek universe and make it more malleable for future outings, without the writers having to be too beholding to what has come before. You can see the Vulcan logic in that, but sadly it comes across as little more than a big intergalactic middle finger and slap in the face to those that hold the trek universe dear to them.<br/><br/>It showed me what I have suspected for a very long time; JJ Abrams is a brilliant visionary, however he lacks the story telling skills necessary to compliment his brilliant ideas. He has gone on record and stated that he was not a fan of Star Trek before he became involved in the film and if I am absolutely honest, that shows in abundance. Star Trek is a franchise that has its own universe and 40 years of history to draw on, but like every universe it has its own rules and heritage. This film does not have that feel and as a result of this Abrams and the writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have dropped a clanger, making it feel just a little bit cheap and shallow, lacking the depth and true exploration of the human condition which classic Trek is famous for. If the re-vamped Star Trek is going to be a long running franchise, I would advise all involved to take a leaf out of the books of Bryan Singer's 'X-Men', Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' and Zach Snyder's brilliant 'Watchmen', which have all been treated with shameless love and affection which shines through.<br/><br/>Despite the poor plot and story and that it runs dangerously close to cheesy in places, the film just about makes amends by keeping up an energetic pace, mixing the action and slower scenes well; there are also some very clever references back to the original series and movies, which is a bit of a treat for the Trekkies to pick out. As I mentioned before, there is just about enough here to like despite its very big flaws and if they can iron out the bugs I am keen to see what the inevitable sequels will hold. For the new generation of Trek newbie's (who I'm sure won't give a damn about my bleating on about plot, storyline and Trek heritage) I have no doubt that Star Trek will be the blockbuster of the year and encourage just as loyal a following as the originals. For me though its shortcomings sadly took enough gloss off for me to think it as nothing more than just above average."
"surface6669","6","1","5","19 May 2009"," not as much of a disappointment as I though, but...
","it was still not a very good Star Trek movie IMHO. I was worried about this movie from when I first saw the trailers (and thought that Kirk & Uhura were going to hook up!) right through to when I saw the director openly say that he wasn't a fan of the original Star Trek series. Ugh...<br/><br/>Well, I WAS a big fan of the original series, and every other Star Trek series had to grow on me some before I would ""accept"" it (except for Voyager...that was just a bunch of baloney IMO).<br/><br/>So, I am left with many, many questions now that this movie has apparently ""rebooted"" the entire Star Trek universe (and yes, I know that it was just a bunch of TV shows).<br/><br/>What about Kirk's brother?? He dies in one of the original Star Trek TV episodes. Was he born before Jim Kirk was, or do they even have the same father now (or then, in the original series)?? Captain Pike never commands the Enterprise on missions with Spock to that forbidden planet (from The Menagerie), where he will apparently end up after being crippled at a much later date? Spock has no Mom now?? What about his half-brother from Star Trek 5?? Where the heck did HE come from?? Kirk gets to be Captain of the Enterprise *immediately* at the end of this current movie without having to train as a lower-ranked officer on other Starships?? That seems like a rash move by Starfleet...they let him skip 5 or so ranks just like that?? I can understand him being ""promoted"" to acting First Officer during the initial crisis when StarFleet didn't have enough personnel to go around, but give me a break! I think this next one is already in the ""Goofs"" section for this movie...but in the Star Trek original series, no one had ever seen a Romulan before, so no one knew that they looked like & shared an ancient ancestry with Vulcan, but yet no one gets excited about seeing them as they really look (pointed ears & all) in this latest movie. Huh?? At least Kirk didn't sleep with Uhura, but Spock does?? What the heck is up with that??? Basically, if you believe this current movie, then everything that has basically happened in the entire Star Trek universe (from the original series onward) has either never happened now or it will now happen in at least a slightly different way. I wonder if Spock will still die like he did at the end of the Star Trek 2 movie?? This current movie is a pretty good action movie, and I agree with the director that it might even be better if you come to this movie with little to no knowledge of the Star Trek universe. However, as a devoted Trekkie myself, I'd say skip the entire thing.<br/><br/>If the next movie tries to re-write even more of the Star Trek universe, I might even pass on that movie altogether!"
"Jawsphobia","Null","1","5","18 May 2009"," Star Trek with a Death Star to destroy
","In the 1980's there was more cross-over than clash between fans of Star Trek and Star Wars as I recall. The last I saw of that rivalry was in the movie Fanboys which - though very entertaining - was given a release reserved for would-be sleeper hits and then it just never woke up. The verdict is pretty well in for Star Trek (2009) and a possible revival of interest in that brand, which would add insult to injury for Star Wars fans (who have had to endure their own prequels culminating in the animated Clone Wars and Jabba the Hutt's heretofore unheard of larvae son) except for the oft repeated term ""Star Wars-style reboot."" There is plenty of action and humor, without the long sequences of staring into a bright light or long drawn out space-dock departures with any floating of people or things from one place to the other miles away feeling like the trip must occur in real time. I think this is the first time I remember seeing a Star Trek shuttle travel quickly. Ebert nit-picked a few things I couldn't care less about. If you buy warp drive and you buy teleportation then it's not much of a leap to say that a beaming genius might figure out a formula for doing one during the other."
"katran1","9","1","5","10 May 2009"," Very enjoyable
","I think this movie was a great kick off to a new series of Star Trek films. I don't know if this is considered a spoiler, but I think the alternate timeline idea was a very good one. Now they essentially have a clean slate with which to make more movies that don't necessarily have to keep to the continuity of the previous films and series.<br/><br/>The casting was excellent. Everyone offered a great performance, though Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as McCoy were really standout performances, in my opinion. Karl especially seemed to be channeling DeForest Kelley, his portrayal of ""Bones"" was just so spot-on.<br/><br/>I would see this movie again in a heartbeat and can't wait for it to come out on DVD."

","Saw Star Trek at the IMAX today. It was exciting from the get go. The special effects were wonderful and the casting was perfect. I must say that I was awfully surprised when Karl Urban was cast as Dr. Leonard McCoy. However, I think DeForest Kelley would've been pleased with the choice. The characters meshed well and showed the traits of the original cast very well. Eric Bana was wonderful as the Romulan villain, Nero. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone as it is PURE entertainment and well worth the cost of seeing it on the IMAX screen. Oh, I loved the writer's sneaking in little catch phrases from the original series!"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","7","1","5","10 May 2009"," A good start
","Star Trek is an all around entertaining action film that can appeal to Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike. With new ship designs and state-of-the-art effects, Abrams delivers a totally different Star Trek universe. The inside of the ships bear little to no resemblance to the original series, and the planet Earth looks radically different from the original movies. Not that I'm complaining. <br/><br/>**Major plot spoilers** In the 24th century, a sun is about to go supernova which threatens the galaxy, although I don't know how one sun going supernova would be such a grave threat. Leonard Nimoy's Spock attempts to prevent it but he is too late. The planet Romulus is destroyed. Spock launches something called ""Red Matter"" into the sun, creating a black hole, which sucks his ship and the Romulan miner Nero's ship in. Nero is sent back to the 23rd century, and Spock arrives 25 years later. Nero unwittingly kills Captain Kirk's father, seriously altering his life. When Nero finds Nimoy's Spock, he exiles him on a Vulcan moon that is a barren ice planet similar to Hoth from the Empire Strikes Back. Basically the first twenty-five minutes of the film establishes Kirk and Spock's lives before starfleet, after which it kicks into high gear. Nero plans to avenge the destruction of Romulus by using a material called Red Matter to create black holes in the cores of the Planet Vulcan and Earth. This raises an obvious question: how could Nero go through a black hole and survive if black holes destroy entire planets? We simply have to say ""It's a movie."" Kirk and the company have to stop Nero before he can destroy Earth.**End Spoilers** <br/><br/>The plot is a little simplistic and leaves a bit to be desired, what with the plot holes and all. The film's main strength is the cast. Star Trek accomplishes the most important goal when it comes to rebooting popular franchises: creating new versions of old characters that are just as likable. Chris Pine is very entertaining as Captain Kirk. He wisely chose not to imitate William Shatner, yet he has the characteristics of Kirk down pat. Zachary Quinto plays a sympathetic, tortured Spock who struggles with his emotion more than Nimoy's Spock ever did. Spock and Kirk have an intense rivalry that drives the film and provides most of the entertainment. Karl Urban does an impeccable (and very funny) imitation of DeForest Kelley. Uhura was never really developed well so Zoey had an easy task ahead of her. Her relationship with Spock comes as a bit of a surprise, there was not much development or preparation for it. Simon Pegg is very funny as Scotty. John Cho is not given much to do as Sulu. Leonard Nimoy's appearance is welcome and turned out to be longer than I thought. The only crew member I did not like was Chekov; his accent was too thick. The most disappointing character turns out to be Nero. His character is just not that interesting. At least we don't have to see him again in the sequels. All in all, I look forward to seeing this cast in the future. <br/><br/>Hopefully future sequels will have stories that feel more like Star Trek stories rather than Sci-fi action movies with the Star Trek name on it."
"supersabref100","7","1","5","10 May 2009"," Very Good but no where near Great
","JJ Abrahams rebooting of Star Trek works. You have to walk into the theater knowing that what you know about Star Trek is being thrown out the window to some extent! The actors fit their characters. Only Spock seems off. Not the actor but the character. Too emotional. I know he's half human but it was a bit much for such a classic character.<br/><br/>The biggest improvement Abrahams made in the film to recent Star trek films is the passing. this movie moves along at a brisk pace. Unlike Nemesis, which I thought was decent, this Star Trek starts off fast and keeps going. Also unlike previous films, which seemed like large budget TV episodes, this is a MOVIE. You can see a big budget on screen. And in this day of good and bad cgi, the big budget makes this picture seem like an event film rather than a niche production of an endearing TV series.<br/><br/>The story is paper thin. The villain, I enjoy Eric Banna as an actor, but his villain is nothing special. Okay.<br/><br/>What make this movie work is the spirit. It's fun.<br/><br/>NO THIS MOVIE IS NOT AS GOOD AS SOME REVIEWS AND FANS MAKE IT OUT TO BE. But it's still entertaining and fun summer film. You don't need to be a trekkie to enjoy."

","So up front, I'm NOT a Trekkie from way back. I've seen a couple of the big screen films, I've seen a few old eps, but my Trek time has mostly been Next Gen, and not for a fair while. My Trek knowledge is rusty, and maybe the premiere was wasted upon me, but Trekkie or not, I enjoyed the HECK out of this!<br/><br/>I do have concerns that I liked it so much BECAUSE I don't have preconceived ideas of what character and story *should* do in this film. The reasons I loved it might turn out to be the reasons fans of old Trek hate it with a blinding passion. I can't know. But I thought it was a great flick, I thought it was cleverly done, well executed, and I really enjoyed the actors. Not been completely familiar with the old characters, I'm not 100% sure, but I think they did a pretty good job of matching up the youngsters, and the youngsters executed their roles pretty well, in my opinion. I'm really interested to see what old school Trekkies think!<br/><br/>I don't *think* you can spoiler a prequel, but having said that, the premise they've based this film on might negate that statement. So I'm going to put some *possible* spoilers out of order at the end under a cut - if someone tells me that they're not spoilers, I'll remove the cut! :)<br/><br/>We were bag-checked and electronics scanned on the way into the cinema, but if I'd had my phone, and could have microblogged it, this is what I would have said! (Transcribed from notes written in the dark...)<br/><br/>* Starts out with a bang! <br/><br/>* Wha? Who is Nemo? <br/><br/>* emotional ping early on... <br/><br/>* Li'l Spock and Li'l Kirk are cute! <br/><br/>* Silar rocks as Spock! <br/><br/>* Should I know who Spock's mum is? What's with that bosom?! <br/><br/>* Cute cuts between glimpses of Kirk and Spock growing up... <br/><br/>* WTF is Leonard McCoy? <br/><br/>* Ohhhh, Bones, right...<br/><br/>* Aw man! I wanted to see some training! <br/><br/>* Oh! Bana! That's who! Duh. <br/><br/>* Why the short skirts? Surely by the whatever the heck century it is we can have equal opportunity uniforms! Really, did they need to stick to canon like that? <br/><br/>* Some dorky funny stuff - giggles from the crowd. <br/><br/>* Music a bit obvious... <br/><br/>* Awesome cool fight scenes. <br/><br/>* Kinda lost a little suspense as we all know who lives ... or do we? <br/><br/>* Kirk's kinda insane, right? <br/><br/>* Eric Bana has rockin' tatts! <br/><br/>* Nimoy cool! Much cooler than I thought he'd be! <br/><br/>* Teenage baby Enterprise crew - too cool! It's like a YA flick!<br/><br/>* Whole new gen of fans from this flick I reckon. <br/><br/>* Now I *wanna* watch original Trek!<br/><br/>Right - I'm not sure if what lies beneath are spoilerish. I'm very wary of doing the wrong thing on this one, but I'd love for someone who knows old Trek and would care if they got a *possible* spoil to tell me if it is or not!<br/><br/>* Were Spock and Uhura canon? V. sweet and just a little sexy. <br/><br/>* I LOVE the idea that we now have an alternate universe - is this likely to be worked on for future films? A new TV series? It's such a clever idea, and set up to work really well! Explicitly well. But only if the fact that Kirk's dad really didn't die in original Trek. Otherwise, old Spock was just blowing smoke in my ear! Crafty old bastard :)<br/><br/>Final verdict? LOVE! I really really enjoyed this. I sat forward in my seat a lot, I laughed when I was supposed to, I think, and I was pretty impressed. I think this has been marketed exactly right - I'm not certain hard core fans will love it, but I think it will appeal to a whole new generation. And that rocks."

A good solid story; <br/><br/>2. A story cleverly constructed to make sure that this film was both consistent with the established continuity of the on-screen Star Trek universe yet also sufficiently legitimately outside that continuity to permit variations. Not a bad trick!: <br/><br/>3. Excellent casting. These performances are not slavish impressions of the original cast, but they do much to capture the essence of the well-loved characters from the original series. In particular, Pine captures the swagger and braggadocio of the young Kirk perfectly; <br/><br/>4. Spock and Spock. Quinto looks uncannily like the young Nimoy, but to have Nimoy himself playing the aged Spock, and to see the difference between the young and the old and to understand how it happened - magical; <br/><br/>5.

Backstory - we always knew these characters existed before and after what we saw on TV and then the movies - these early moments fit perfectly into what we already knew; <br/><br/>7. Alexander Courage's theme and the ""Space, the Final Frontier"" voice-over, and Majel Barret's voice; <br/><br/>I would have enjoyed this film a great deal even had I not been a fan of the original TV series: however, being familiar with the series adds huge emotional resonance almost all the way through. <br/><br/>I really, really, really enjoyed this movie."

","Freeing itself from the baggage of the previous instalments by setting its plot in an alternate timeline, thus preserving the contents of the original series without entirely depending on it, Star Trek is the reboot of the highly popular franchise of the same name that attempts to resurrect its vast universe from the ground up for a new generation of viewers but it has a lot in store for the old Trekkies as well.<br/><br/>Taking place in an alternate reality from the original series, the story of Star Trek follows the early years of James T. Kirk & Spock, covering their time in Starfleet which is soon followed by them travelling aboard the USS Enterprise to go against Captain Nero; a Romulan from the future who has traversed back in time and is hellbent on destroying the Vulcan planet to avenge the destruction of his own home which takes place in the near future.<br/><br/>Directed by J.J. Abrams, Star Trek presents a much revamped look & post-modern feel and is crafted in a manner that makes its mythology more appealing & accessible to newcomers without alienating the devoted fans of the original series. The plot unfolds at a vibrant pace thanks to Abrams' kinetic direction and although the screenplay does feature an interesting story, it never really ups the ante & stays at the same level from start to finish.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, the production design team does a fabulous job in putting up some truly impressive sets on the screen. Cinematography makes extensive use of its colour palette while the dynamic camera-work carries a momentum of its own. Its 127 minutes of runtime is rarely felt, visual effects & make-up are undeniably state-of-the-art stuff, and Michael Giacchino earns a high score for chipping in with a soundtrack that simply fits.<br/><br/>The cast comprises of Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Eric Bana, Leonard Nimoy, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg & others, and although everyone fails to make a lasting impression, none of them can be considered a disappointment either. Pine & Quinto are quite believable as Kirk & Spock, respectively, and their developing chemistry only works out in the film's favour. Also, Nimoy delivers a shot of nostalgia by reprising the role of original Spock from the original series.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Star Trek manages to get most things right than wrong and yet, I don't feel much love for it as, just like Star Wars, this series never interested me in the first place. The technical brilliance of this reboot cannot be denied but its main story packs in nothing that's captivating enough to change my mind. An eye-popping production that features an engaging story but lacks escalation, Star Trek is a 21st century makeover of a classic franchise for 21st century filmgoers. Worth a shot for sure."
"comco-1","6","1","6","8 March 2010"," there must have been a story somewhere
","I imagine that there was a ""time warp"" in which both the characters and the screen writers got mixed up, thereby producing this hopelessly confused film. In tune with ""Lost"", characters appeared, disappeared, and reappeared, leaving the viewer in bewilderment. Leonard Nimoy's performance as Mr. Spock was excellent as usual. We watched the final scene of a lifetime defined by a single role. It was a good scene, though. In contrast, the character of his father was wooden, at best. We watched three scenes where James Tiberius Kirk clung to life at the edge of a precipice, but we knew there was no real danger because he was the star. The scene in which he leaped from a speeding Corvette was beyond all physical reality. The gorgeous woman in green body makeup was lovely to see, but the green color was obviously fake, and her bright red lips made the shallow attempt to create an alien seem silly. The film was long, too."

","The slightly depressing trend for ""rebooting"" older film series continues with this re-imagining of the origins of the original Star Trek crew. Having grown up with The Next Degradation, Voyeur and Deep Space Nine Inches I was expecting the standard po-faced, lumpen headed diplomacy that usually accompanies our forays into the universe of the United Federation of Plonkers.<br/><br/>Yes, you guessed it, I hate Star Trek. In my book there are two available options when you see an alien, either shooting it with a blaster (one that emphatically does NOT have a ""stun"" setting) or making it an ally in your fight against the tyrannical galaxy-spanning imperium you are rebelling against. Sitting down and negotitating with said alien whilst attempting to understand and respect it's culture simply isn't an option in my book.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Star Trek Begins is much more Undiscovered Country (or Khath of Wran, depending on your taste) than Final Frontier.<br/><br/>Spoiler In the opening sequence George Kirk (James' father) saves the lives of his ship's crew by heroically going to ramming speed against a sinister time traveling Romulan ship which emerges from a space anomaly. Said evil ship is piloted by the Hulk (not the Incredible Hulk, the other, arty one) sporting some natty facial tats. One of the crew George saves is his heavily pregnant wife who gives birth to James T during the escape.<br/><br/>We are treated to a short introduction to both Kirk (who is a total d*ck) and Spock before Kirk signs up for Starfleet at the urging of his father's friend, Captain Pike of the Enterprise.<br/><br/>After some fairly tiresome Starfleet Academy antics the film really gets going when the Enterprise is sent to investigate an anomaly similar to the one that killed Kirks father and everything goes to hell in a handbasket. The Hulk and his Romulan pals destroy a wave of Starfleet ships and then mash Vulcan using perhaps the most impractical super-weapon ever. This appears to involve lowering a big drill into the planets atmosphere and then waiting until it drills down to the core and dropping something down the hole. It is impressive that no one on Vulcan says ""Oi, you with the tats! Stop drilling our planet or we'll blow you up and failing that we'll blow up your drill"" but it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>Spock, now captaining the Enterprise refuses Kirks plan to go head to head with the vastly superior baddie ship, when Kirk refuses to comply with the order Spock has him marooned on Hoth. By a coincidence of Godzilla like proportions Kirk is stranded on the planet where the original Spock (Nimoy) who's been thrown back in time along with the Romulans and is hiding out. By a rather universe breaking deus ex machina they end up back on the Enterprise, Kirk takes over as captain from Spock and saves the day by blowing old Hulky and his squid ship into a new black hole. Huzzay. Mr Spock (that's the old one not the young/new one) explains that as a result of the destruction of Vulcan they are now in a parallel dimension to the original crew. This means they can make new sequels or a new series and not have to worry about external continuity.<br/><br/>End Spoiler While I didn't like Chris Pine playing Kirk who made him seem rather unlikeable and emotionless everyone else is pretty good; Syler makes a convincing Spock, Uhura is likable if underused and Pegg's Scotty steals every scene he's in but the real shocker is Karl ""Blood and Muscles"" Urban's brilliant ""Bones"" McCoy who captures the spirit of the original brilliantly right up to and perhaps surpassing the inevitable ""For God's sake, Jim, I'm a doctor not a..."".<br/><br/>The film is however beset by a few issues. Blinding light and lens-flare all over the bloody place, nosebleed inducing sound and editing that isn't so much fast as psychotic. There's barely a frame in the film where there isn't some sort of lens-flare going off all over the place. Frankly if Kirk picked up a coffee cup there'd be lens-flare coming off it. Allied to this is the fact that for some reason virtually every scene ends with the entire screen slowly going blinding white. The sound team have obviously been influenced by the recent Star Wars films as everything makes some sort of incredible noise – this works to raise the adrenaline in the early part of the film but later on it becomes a bit too much. There is a fair amount of punching in this film (always good in a Star Trek movie) but the massively unrealistic two-pieces-of-wood-smacked-together punching noise beloved of Indiana Jones is rather out of place. The editing is very much the post-Generation-X attention-span-of-a-gnat type of affair that we're used to courtesy of people like Wachowski brothers but it is generally fairly simple to work out what is going on.<br/><br/>Minor stylistic issues aside, I enjoyed Star Trek. The plot is absolute rubbish but who cares? There are spaceships and explosions and punching and more explosions. Go with it and you wont notice that at the heart of the plot is a series of coincidences of galactic proportions."

","I got a great deal of enjoyment from this film. As one who watched the original in a dormitory TV room every Friday night, I have always embraced this canon, though I've never reached the lunatic fringe. Now that the original crew is either old, fat, or dead, I see nothing wrong with taking the characters and recasting them. If Basil Rathbone had been the only Holmes, we would never have had Jeremy Brett. I hope this sets up a future because there was nowhere to go with the originals (this is a fact of life called aging). The scenes of the founding of the relationships among the characters is nicely done. Those that criticize the look of the ship need to look what has happened here on earth in the last twenty years. Why should the bridge not change to become more true to the future as we can view it now? I thought the new characters found their individual ways. We forget that Kirk was always a bit of a loose cannon and we get to see why. Starship captains needed to have controlled recklessness to boldly go, as they say. The plot is up to the plots of the early series and all the bells and whistles complement this. The strength is the new characters. About fifteen minutes into the film I forgot that they weren't Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner. I just started enjoying the film."

A fast car, someone following that car, an insane stunt ... you'd be forgiven for thinking this was an car stunt movie ...<br/><br/>And you might have had doubts about the end result of this movie. Especially if you were a fan of the Original Series and movies. This looked like some action movie, that had nothing to do with the charm that Kirk & Co were able to achieve on screen. And again you would be wrong. Of course William Shatner is a character in his own rights and he played ""James T. Kirk"" as only he himself could play a role like that. But having said that, this new ""Tiberius"" is great, too. In fact since this is Science Fiction, the explanation why we get a new ""Kirk"" is a pretty good one (imho).<br/><br/>Even my casting concerns, weren't an issue. The guy from Harold and Kumar in a Star Trek movie? Simon Pegg is great, but what is he doing in a Science Fiction movie? Well they all fit the bill. It's a fun ride and it can only get bumpy, if you really try to compare it too much with the Original Series. You shouldn't do that!

","Star Trek is a ""reboot"" of the classic franchise started by Gene Roddenberry as a little television show on NBC a few decades ago. In particular, this film revisits the original incarnation of Star Trek and the subsequent movies and creates a bit of a new origin story. With a very long history of lore and legions of fans, director J.J. Abrams and company had to both respect the story of Star Trek as it was and also tread new territory. They found an out that both respected the history of the overall franchise and let them rewrite it at the same time: the alternate universe. Using the long-standing tradition in Star Trek history, the reboot boldly takes us where no fan has gone before...<br/><br/>The trouble all starts when revenge-bent Romulans from the future show up in the past, blowing up the ship that happens to be carrying the father of James (""Jim"") Tiberius Kirk, thus altering time forever. However, Kirk, with some prodding from Captain Christopher Pike (who Star Trek fans might remember from the pilot episode ""The Cage""), Kirk ends up repeating much of history anyhow. Meeting the various members of the crew that would form the Enterprise anyway, they respond to a distress call from Spock's home planet, Vulcan. Then a series of troubles occur involving the future-Romulans, amidst other things.<br/><br/>The story itself is convoluted at times, requires a lot of faith from the audience and takes some rather contrived leaps of logic to propel it forward. Consequently, the actual mechanics of the story often are alarmingly strange. Why is the entire Federation Fleet on the other side of the galaxy? Why would they leave their various homeworlds completely unprotected? Furthermore, a number of plot holes show up throughout the film. This is very distracting from the emotional core of the story, which is actually quite good, focusing on the friendship between Kirk, Spock and Bones as well as keeping the rest of the classic Enterprise crew well involved. If you're willing to overlook the various leaps of logic in the story, then in terms of crafting tension and twists of fate, it serves its purpose well.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of the film is the acting from the various players. Chris Pine does an acceptable job as Kirk, being a bit more brash and bad boy as well as generally avoiding the specific vocal inflections that William Shatner wrote into the character's legacy. Zachary Quinto's Spock was perhaps the farthest from the original portrayal, played with a lot more simmering emotion than Leonard Nimoy's original incarnation. Given the greater emphasis on Spock's human side in this incarnation, it makes sense. I also still had some trouble getting Quinto's Sylar character out of my head while watching him perform, which might have muddied my appreciation of the role. In some ways, it's the lesser members of the cast that seem to have benefited the most from this incarnation, each getting a chance to shine. Eric Bana on the other hand, gets a rather poorly drawn character to portray in Nero, having to rage and stomp around in a fit most of the time.<br/><br/>There are a lot of cute Star Trek references thrown in throughout the film, which Star Trek fans might appreciate. The designs for the film do a surprising amount of respect to the original designs (although I still don't understand why the female crew members get stuck in the mini- dresses reflecting the original series) while ""modernizing"" the appearance to appeal to our circa 2009 sense of aesthetics. Special effects are expectedly good for a tentpole pic and the overall technical production is solid.<br/><br/>Purists probably won't appreciate this film that much, due to its rather large deviance from canon. And anyone who bothers to think about the various story points will probably find it somewhat lacking. On the other hand, the film still does well in terms of its focus on the story of the Star Trek trio and keeps the story moving along. Personally, I find the story logic problematic enough that I was frequently distracted from the point. However, this is still a rather engaging and entertaining movie, despite those problems. It'll still be a solid distraction for those looking for a fun movie, but losing the sci-fi for adventure and its hand-waving conceits keep it from the greatness that I've heard it reflected. Which, I guess, puts it in the range of the rest of the more enjoyable Star Trek films. 7/10."
"martinmcdonough","7","1","6","25 June 2009"," Not bad, but not what I expected either
","Like most fans of the genre, I went to watch this movie with an open mind and purposely waited for it to be out for at least a month so the theater would not be crowded and my opinion would not be swayed by audience reactions. With that being said, here is my opinion of this movie. Take it for what you will. Character synopsis first:<br/><br/>1. I liked the portrayal of Bones, Scotty, Sulu and young Spock. Not too much of them and they were used just right.<br/><br/>2. Checkov was silly. But then again, he was silly in the series, so I suppose that's par for the course.<br/><br/>3. Uhura was used badly. I mean, honestly, sure she was sexy but she never had the hots for Spock. I guess the writers got her mixed up with Nurse Chapel. I hope they stray from this in the next movie (and there will be one, guaranteed) because it was becoming annoying as the movie played on. I'm just glad they didn't have her sing ""Beyond Antares."" <br/><br/>4. Kirk - not sure. Jury still out on him. Although, I must say, I loved his performance when he beat the Kobayashi Maru test.<br/><br/>5. Pike - great. Always wished they would've used him more in the original series (even though Jeff Hunter wasn't available, or dead, not sure when he died, but I digress).<br/><br/>6. Sarek - wooden.<br/><br/>7. Amanda - glad she's dead. Never did like Wynonna Rider anyway.<br/><br/>8. Starfleet Commander - did they HAVE to use Madea / Tyler Perry? I would have rather seen Ice-T.<br/><br/>9. Nero - Eric Bana was great. But he usually is, so that should be no surprise.<br/><br/>Now for the plot:<br/><br/>Hmm. Interesting. They used the time-travel paradox to create their own alternative universe so the next movie or two can do whatever they want based off the reality they created with this first movie. So, is this kind of like the part in ""Back to the Future, Part II"" where we would follow the timelime where Biff has the almanac, is rich and powerful, has Doc Brown committed, kills George McFly, etc. etc.? <br/><br/>Does this mean Spock has to grow a goatee? Always did like that episode.<br/><br/>Well, I'll give it to you because this movie was intended to be a ""reboot"" and ""re-imagining"" of Trek, so to do that you would have to cut from the original ""fabric"" and weave your own tapestry. So I get it. But since when is a Romulan mining vessel armed to the teeth, gigantic in size and power, and able to dispatch six or seven starfleet vessels without so much as losing shield power? And if it's from the future - the future of the Original Series, the TV shows and all the movies prior - don't you think that this kind of a vessel and the power contained within would've been mentioned SOMEWHERE in there?<br/><br/>But other than that, it wasn't bad. Wasn't very deep, but it wasn't bad. Good popcorn movie.<br/><br/>Just do me one favor - lose the Ewok/Gremlin tagging along with Scotty? Please?<br/><br/>Marty"
"paudie","7","1","6","18 June 2009"," Once more. From the beginning
","I had read the decent reviews and decided to take a chance and see this movie, despite not being a Star Trek fan. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a case of leaving your brain at the foyer and just going with the flow. The idea of going back to the origins of the how the Enterprise crew came together is an excellent one as it gives us, essentially, new characters. Frankly the Shatner Enterprise crew and the Next Generation troops were past their sell by date, although Leonard Nimoy has a reasonably big role as ""Old Spock"" in a nod to the older fans. The effects are excellent, the action never stops and there are some good one-liners. What more could you want? Don't give yourself a headache by trying to make sense of the plot, involving time travel among other things. Just strap yourself in and get ready for another successful franchise to blast off!"
"Kaukomarsu","9","1","6","8 June 2009"," This is how a franchise reboot should be done!
","First things first: I have never been a huge Star Trek fan. Sure, I've seen the Original Series and I watched Next Generation.<br/><br/>Now, more than 40 years after the Original Series, finally a bold new version of Star Trek has seen the light of day. It's action-packed, it's beautiful to look at and it's funny. It's everything a good space adventure should be, simply a great time at the movies.<br/><br/>I haven't been a huge fan of J.J. Abrams, either. Sure, Alias was fun at times, but Lost always left me cold. Cloverfield was kind of silly, although the idea was interesting. Mission: Impossible III was fair entertainment, but nothing unforgettable.<br/><br/>In Star Trek, Abrams has tackled a huge challenge - and he succeeds in the seemingly impossible task. The new cast is familiar and exciting at the same time. The visuals are simply stunning. The story is strong, and the script gives the actors plenty to work with.<br/><br/>It all shows in the final product. It's sleek, it's fun, it's interesting, even thought-provoking. That's really almost more than you could ask from a big summer movie. But it's all here.<br/><br/>Welcome back, Star Trek - may you live long and prosper!"
"pninson","6","1","6","28 May 2009"," Entertaining, but silly
","The new Star Trek film is entertaining and enjoyable, as long as you don't pay too much attention to the gaping holes in plot logic. For the most part, the early versions of all the familiar characters are well cast, with the notable exception of the ultra-geeky Chekhov, whose fake Russian accent is atrocious.<br/><br/>Chris Pine turns in a solid performance as the young Jim Kirk, perhaps the most demanding role. He's a three-dimensional, believable character, although he's asked to be even more of a superhero than he was in the original series. Let's assume that the older Kirk was tempered by experience and let it go at that.<br/><br/>It took me a while to stop thinking of Zachary Quinto as Sylar; he can't quite keep the creepiness out of his voice. But he looks the part of Spock, who naturally can't be expected to have the warmth that the older character projects.<br/><br/>Nice to Sam Neill as Christopher Pike.<br/><br/>The major weakness of the film is its use of shaky-cam/quick editing. As in the Bourne sequels and the last James Bond films, the action sequences are virtually incomprehensible. You get a general idea of what's happening, but it all flashes at you so fast most of it is a blur.<br/><br/>The plot won't stand up to much scrutiny. A renegade Romulan from the future blames the older Spock for the destruction of his planet, and seeks revenge not only on the planet Vulcan but Earth. It seems odd that, having come back in time, he doesn't try to alter events to save his world, but he's not playing with a full deck. A bigger problem is that he's a bland, uninteresting villain with little screen presence, and as little screen time. His ship is much scarier than he is.<br/><br/>What will likely be most controversial is the retconning --- retroactive continuity. This means changing the backstory from earlier shows and films. And this film takes it all the way: when the story is done, none of the original ST episodes will ever happen. There will be no visit to Talos IV for Captain Pike; no visit to Vulcan for Spock to deal with his ""pon farr."" (And what are Vulcans supposed to do about that now, anyway?) We're left with a brand new parallel world, presumably so sequels can be made without having to mesh with previous continuity. This is something new; it's a bit like Kirk's solution to the Kobyashi Maru simulation (""it had the virtue of never having been tried"".) A fun film, likely to frustrate true believers in its utter disrespect for continuity, but enjoyable enough for those willing to take it at face value."
"shakawtwf","5","1","6","28 May 2009"," Liked it quite a bit, didn't love it
","As I get older, there are two things that can derail a movie for me: extreme excess (i.e. too much) and poorly-explained plot points (i.e. too little).<br/><br/>I liked the movie quite a bit, I thought the actors were great (Bones and Scotty especially) and the action scenes were exciting.<br/><br/>I was concerned when I saw the Romulan ship at the beginning, it wasn't just big, it was the biggest, meanest, pointiest, sharpest, least cuddly ship that ever existed. When I see something like this, I get worried because I think the whole movie is going to be like this, i.e. overblown and excessive to the nth degree. Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" was like that and I hated it.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the movie DIDN'T proceed along those lines, it didn't just rely totally on just being excessive. For the first time, we get to meet the characters that we've known for 40 years and it was fun to see them as younger people.<br/><br/>The plot point that I found poorly explained was when older Spock shows up. He tells us about an attempt to help the Romulans that results in the destruction of their planet (causing Spock and Nero's ship to be pulled back in time, thereby starting everything that we've already seen). I didn't understand any of the red matter/black hole stuff. Spock's explanation was raced through, quickly dashed-off and felt shoehorned. If I were able to rewind it and hear it again, that would have been helpful.<br/><br/>The divergences from the Star Trek universe that we've always known bothered me too. Uhura and Spock making out so much. Traditionally Spock was conflicted about his dual nature, he was always trying to keep his emotions in check. Here he's a light switch: completely logical one minute, completely emotional the next. Just because the Romulans went back in time and changed Kirk's life, there's no reason it would necessarily have any affects on Spock. The other things that bothered me were Vulcan being destroyed and Spock's mother dying. If they don't fix these things in the next movie, I'm going to be very cross. :) Repeated viewings might fix a lot of the problems I had with the movie. But if the audience doesn't understand the story you're trying to tell the first time, it's probably not the audience's fault.<br/><br/>Update (11/18/09): I watched this again last night and I DID like it better than the first time (I was able to follow the story better without any pre-conceptions) however what bothered me the first time still bothers me now.<br/><br/>Spock Prime's actions with the red matter didn't cause Romulus's destruction, couldn't have prevented it and were completely unnecessary. The script requires him to release the red matter so he and Nero can go back in time but Nero's need for revenge is completely baseless since Spock didn't cause Romulus's destruction.<br/><br/>Young Spock's behavior with Uhura is just completely out-of-character. In TOS, Spock's emotional outbursts were lapses of logic not an integrated part of his personality. His behavior would not be affected whatsoever by Nero going back in time and changing Kirk's life.<br/><br/>If Spock Prime was close enough to witness the destruction of Vulcan from Delta Vega, wouldn't that outpost be sucked in by the singularity too? It was all too convenient that Spock, Kirk and Scotty would have all been on the same outpost at the same time. I doubt that Young Spock would have jettisoned Kirk onto that moon anyway.<br/><br/>The problem the first time was that these thoughts were preventing me from seeing other nuances that were good. On second viewing, it was an imperfect story told well."
"btweensunandmoon","8","1","6","24 May 2009"," Worthy of being called Trek but comes up short against the best in the series..
","I have a confession to make. I am a Trekkie... Not the kind that attends conventions sporting fake pointed ears, but one who has seen all of the movies more than once and most of the TV shows. I'm going to do part of my review in a compare contrast format. The movie I'll be comparing it to will be The Wrath of Kahn, universally regarded as the gold standard of Trek movies. Many reviewers are going so far as to call this new Trek the best of all the Star Trek movies. I feel that is going a bit too far and I will argue why its not. I'm going to break it down into a few basic categories.<br/><br/>Villain<br/><br/>Star Trek: Nero The Wrath of Kahn: Khan<br/><br/>Winner...Kahn by a landslide. Both had good revenge motives but Kahn will go down as one of the greatest sci-fi baddies of all time. Riccardo M put down a riveting performance while Eric Bana was pedestrian as Nero. Nero could have benefited from more screen time and better scripting so the character could have developed more. Aside from a short explanation as to why he was ticked off, we never got to fully understand what was going on in his head. <br/><br/>CGI/Special Effects<br/><br/>Winner: The Wrath of Kahn. I just didn't get the wow factor from Star Trek as when I first saw Kahn. TWOK's special effects were revolutionary for its time. They still hold up 27 years after the fact. When you look at Star Trek, you say ""nice CG"". When we were younger and watched Kahn, we were just all blown away. The use of models and organic methods of special effects just achieve something more three dimensional and realistic. <br/><br/>Score<br/><br/>Star Trek: Michael Giacchino The Wrath of Kahn: James Horner<br/><br/>Winner: James Horner. The Wrath of Kahn score is generally regarded as one of the best Sci-Fi movie scores of all time. A superb score will elevate a movie to an entirely new level and that is just what it did. The score for the new Trek is almost pedestrian enough to bring the movie down a bit. The main theme is nice and very catchy if not a bit underdeveloped. The Vulcan theme is beautiful but underdeveloped as well. That's pretty much it and what we get is a lot of repetition of the same material for much of the film. Memorable action music, a staple of the best Trek films, is absent from this movie. <br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Star Trek: Chris Pine and others The Wrath of Kahn: William Shatner and others<br/><br/>Winner: Draw. Can't find much fault in either movie. <br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Winner: The Wrath of Kahn. The genesis device was hugely original, the Kahn vs Kirk fight hugely dramatic, the death of Spock was hugely emotional, and Kirk having a son was hugely surprising. No contest here. The whole ""I'm ticked off and have a super weapon"" thing reminds me too much of Nemesis. TWOK was wonderfully simple. 2 men, each with a comparable ship, playing a big game of chess. <br/><br/>Direction <br/><br/>Star Trek: JJ Abrams The Wrath of Kahn: Nicholas Meyer<br/><br/>Winner: The Wrath of Kahn. Not an easy choice here but a good director can draw the viewer in without relying on a million phaser blasts and explosions. I felt Star Trek was a bit too busy at points, not allowing the viewer a chance to ever focus. In The Wrath of Khan, every torpedo burst, explosion, and phase blast had meaning. There weren't many but what little there were counted for a lot and were precisely detailed. <br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>Winner: The Wrath of Kahn. <br/><br/>Just no contest. Star Trek is a good if not great film but just falls a bit short. Still, it's a worthy entry into the franchise and one I will watch more than a few times."
"NutzieFagin","9","1","6","24 May 2009"," Stellar Summer movie, stellar performances but I have a disability issue.
","I kinda figured that Star Trek pre-sequel was destined to be made due the Star War trilogy series. I have to say for a summer movie I was throughly entertained for the two hour duration Thanx to the performances of the actors, who had big shoes to fill portraying the original beloved TV characters. The actor who portrayed Mr. Spock looked amazingly authentic. Young Kirk, a little on the punky side, was a swaggering cowboy and the attractive Uhura was a smart sex goddess. Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy did not look at all like Deforrest Kelly, but I loved the old line ""Dammit Jim, I'm just a doctor"" Chekov, was probably least impressive but I did enjoy the corny ""Moose and Squirrel"" Russian accent. ""We are arriving on Wulcan"" Could have seen a little more of Sulu. <br/><br/>I won't give anything away, but some beloved characters do not make it. Original trekkers might be somewhat let down because they are seen in the television series later--but I guess we need something to add spice toward the plot.<br/><br/>* I want to discuss something totally unrelated to the movie but involves the disabled. I took three friends who are blind---one with partial site. Despite their blindness, they have followed the original Star Trek series with aids--Audio Description devices. These are headphones that are worn during the movie that give audio description of each scene. When the movie came out, we made plans to see it. I called the theater to make sure that they had the headphones--they did. However, a day before we found out that they only had the device for only TWO movies! (not Star Trek) We were told it was theater policy to have audio description for only two movies showing. In other words, we were screwed! If a person needs this audio description, the theater will insert a CD up in the projection room which transmits to the headphones and is in sync with the movie. As long as the theater goer arrives on time for the movie and the projection room is notified, it is not a problem.<br/><br/>So again, we were told we could not have the device for my blind friends. Also, my blind friends could not see any movie that they wanted, just what they had and MAYBE with a certain show time.---Long story short, my friends were on the phone all day with managers--that this was a violation of the Disability Act. In other words, if you're blind, you have a limited time frame to see a movie in a public movie theater! Very Discriminatory! We finally came to an agreement, They got the Audio description devices at a time agreed. we showed up on time, and ALL enjoyed the flick!<br/><br/>But I had to post this to people who are not blind and want to go to the movies. Would you like your mobility limited because nobody bothered for your service?"
"benjamin_lappin","8","1","6","20 May 2009"," It's Star Trek Jim, But Not As We Know It...
","The re-imagining (royalties go to Ronald D Moore for that words introduction into sci-fi) of the classic cult science fiction series is nothing short of a Hollywood bonanza, fusing together the sensibilities of the original show with an ""updated"" and ""modern"" out look, as Kirk and co's modern counterparts begin their outings as the new standard bearers for the franchise. Normally any Hollywood influence to any prequels, sequels or remakes certifies that it's going to be a money making venture with no real substance as a film, and coming across as an explosion action-packed case study in Michael Bay-ology, however in this instance, for once, it pays dividends. <br/><br/>Firstly, credit must be given to the writers and director who take a very sympathetic approach to the original source material that they are using for their 2009 experience. Star Trek (2009) as a result is not a ""remake"" but what can be attributed as being a ""second generation"" creation. J J Abrams, manages to tell a tale where he can use the preconceived characters but yet alter them, the ship and various other aspects ever so slightly to fit his retelling whilst it still being a Star Trek tale, in that it has the characters of Kirk, Spock, McCoy et al. By interlinking the two universes or ""generations"" through the old science fiction staple of black holes and time travel he justifies his new creation while taking nothing away from the originals which many hold dear to their hearts. <br/><br/>So with the original series careful wrapped up in cotton wool, Abrams gives himself the ability to create his universe as he sees fit, and it possesses a very contemporary feel. It's a very flashy experience, utilising the vast amounts of money that Hollywood can literally warp at the directors but it pays off in its own unique way. The new feel lifts the premise of the film, it takes it from a thing which people would have been mocked for being a fan of into being something cool and attainable by all. This in itself may be a backhanded slap to the Trekkies, and they may feel aggrieved by a new wave of fan that adore this new outing but cannot stand the original, but even they must appreciate that it still harbours the very essence of all things Trekkian. We still have speeches on quantum mechanics, warp fusion cores and all the other facets that comprised many minutes of television time, but it no longer is the driving force behind the story, but more importantly it is no longer the alienating force it once was either. Once again, the ""faithful"" may find it blasphemous and be on forums the web over typing up how disgusted they are but it makes a much more enjoyable experience, a more inclusive experience whereby invisible answers which have no grounding in our understanding of the world are not used to solve problems far beyond many peoples comprehension. By simplifying the premise they heighten the enjoyment, this does not feel like an extended edition on a television episode, this feels like a thoroughbred film as it oozes coolness from every angle, in basic they've made the franchise more believable. <br/><br/>While the story isn't exactly the deepest ever conceived, a mad man who has been wronged demanding retribution for acts upon him, it is held together by an excellent cast which the production and directorial teams should be commended for. The use of a character from the original series tightens what little plot there is creating a believable experience, but the re- imagined individuals set this apart from many other attempted recreations of famous franchises. Chris Pine's Kirk focuses less on the philosophising action man in space elements of his former self and turns him into more of an Indiana Jones character, a wrong place at the wrong time but always able to get through it - man, which brings out a playful side and endearing quality not previously seen before in the Enterprises' captain. Zachary Quinto is undoubtedly the star performer bringing forth a vulnerability and charm that was not truly seen in Spock until ""The Wrath Of Khan"" while Karl Urbans' ""Bones"" is replicated perfection and goes along way into helping the audience becoming absorbed with the outing. The supporting cast provides warmth and charm in their roles reminding us that we don't need to get caught up in the technological and spacial faux pas. In all each other actors make the roles their own, they put a new slant on each while also leaving them still resembling their ""generation one"" counterparts. It is safe to say they carry a film which is low on plot and make it a thoroughly enjoyable roller-coaster, turning a film that I was worried would be like a Michael Bay film into a sci-fi/action film of space-age substance and charm.<br/><br/>J J Abrams has given Star Trek the ""Batman Begins"" treatment, taking a concept with a hardcore fan base but a mass appeal that has somewhat waned in those outside that niche grouping. He has taken the very best parts of what made that first series so successful and fused it with a sense of entertainment and willingness to entertain that could have failed, turning it into nothing more than an action-schmaltz, yet succeeded. The 2009 version of Star Trek is more Return of The Jedi than Revenge of The Sith, more Solyaris than Solaris and more Aliens than Alien vs Predator 2. It isn't trying to compete with that original series from which it basis itself, it isn't trying to out do it and it isn't trying to make it obsolete, it's just a fresh spin from a director who has fresh ideas who has made this first installment a highly engaging (pun intended) experience, allowing everyone to join in with the voyages of the Enterprise."

"kunalkhandwala","9","1","6","19 May 2009"," Exhilarating entertainment!!
","What really appeals about the new Star Trek is that one doesn't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy this movie. The story smartly introduces the viewer to the futuristic world with a brief introduction to the vital characters, builds a promising theme surrounding the protagonists, engages you into the Star Fleet and beams you into outer space with several explosions, action sequences and drama to entertain even the Vulcan mind. Star Trek is a BIG movieÂ….. Gigantic in display, sound, action, performances and sheer excitement. The computer graphics are so impressive that it would not be wrong to compare it to the Star Wars movies. J.J. Abrams, whose work in LOST, Alias and Fringe has earned him enough acclaim to create big expectations from his movie venture, completely astounds both thrill-seekers and Trekkies alike. Star Trek is so freakin good that you won't believe it's Star Trek!!<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams chooses to revive the series by introducing us to the origins of the original crew on Starship Enterprise. Just as we had seen the introduction of James Bond in Casino Royale and Batman in Batman Begins, Abrams takes the series to a higher level that encompasses a much wider audience than the original franchise ever managed to do. First officer 'Spock', played by Zachary Quinto brilliantly portrays his ambivalence between emotion and logic. His tumultuous relationship with James Kirk, superbly enacted by Chris Pine, is most interesting since we know that this duo will turn out to be great companions through their future adventures. On the other side of the force, if we could call it, is the evil Romulan 'Nero' (Eric Bana) who seeks vengeance against the Federation for an event that the future Spock couldn't control. Yes, Star Trek zips you through the black hole to engage you into the time travel theme just as Abrams did in a few episodes of this season's LOST. <br/><br/>Zachary Quinto's performance has a lot of potential as Spock's character adjusts to the new position as First Officer and he befriends his Captain, James Kirk. Chris Pine has finely enacted his rebellious, rogue character through the transition that made him a part of Starfleet and with his genius and instinct, a Captain aboard SS Enterprise. Pine's performance is remarkable because he makes the transition look like it is that of the character's and not at all his own. He is now a big movie star with Star Trek and the future of the franchise looks just fine with him in the lead role. Eric Bana as the menacing Nero is convincing and so is the supporting cast of Uhura, Scotty, McCoy and the Russian geek. <br/><br/>For all the loyal fans of the franchise, there is solace to be found in the fact that Abrams offers enough surprises, nostalgic moments, legendary dialogues, style of credits and the signature closing that indeed takes this movie warping through space. The strong characters, depth in plot, promise of an exciting future and loyalty to the franchise's charming delights ensure that Abrams' Star Trek has boldly gone where no man has gone before. - 9.125 on a scale of 1-10."
"johnnyfive","9","1","6","18 May 2009"," finally, a frontier
","Before I drone on about the highly impressive special effects or the interesting storyline, I must give a special mention to the performances of the new cast to the Enterprise. Chris Pine makes Kirk his own, retaining the womanising overconfident captain (to be) that Shatner before him built up, but also managing to make him fresh and new. The much waited for ""Kobiashi Maru test"" scene sees Pine doing a good impression of Shatner's Kirk though, complete with stilted dialogue. Zachary Quinto has Spock completely nailed, even early on when he is still between being Human and Vulcan. Karl Urban though has to be my favourite, after seeing his performance as ""Bones"" I can imagine no-one else in the role (Dammit Jim i'm a doctor man, not an actor) DeForest Kelly would be proud. His performance doesn't seem like a simple impression either, he simply is... Dr McCoy. Anton Yelchin is fine as Chekov (Didn't join the original crew until the second season I believe) giving a somewhat sincere yet funny performance (""Wictor Wictor"" not ""Victor Victor""). Zoe Saldana is a sexy Uhura and a fine tribute to Nichele Nichols, but who finally gets the kiss with Spock that Nichols' Uhura was supposed to get in the 60's.Sulu has never been so exciting as John Cho's edition, well not since the Undiscovered Country anyway. Simon Pegg's Scotty is highly amusing (I am still curious as to what true Scot James Macavoy would have done with the part) and as with all the cast, they all confidently make the roles their own. Eric Bana's Nero is what Nemesis' Shinzon should have been, but both have been underwritten, I think a bit more time should have been donated for more nasty fun with Nero... perhaps taunting Captain Pike or the crew of the enterprise (think of the memorable taunting in Wrath of Khan and Undiscovered Country).<br/><br/>J.J. Abrahms has successfully dragged Trek into the 21st century, with the excellent casting all-round, cutting edge special effects, witty dialogue and interesting and exciting plot.<br/><br/>Right from the start as the camera pans from the hull of the USS Kelvin we are treated to so much eye candy that our ocular areas may suffer from diabetes, but yet they don't feel superficial or time- filling as they melt in with the live action seamlessly. Never since Spocks death have I felt emotional in a Trek movie since the apparent death of Spock than with the birth of Kirk.. a highly memorable moment.<br/><br/>The dialogue as mentioned while witty is never overly so and is reserved as intentional dialogue, and every character gets their turn. Between Chekov's accent troubles, Kirk's confidence, Scotty's wide eyed freshness, Sulu's chosen hand-to-hand combat skill and even Spock's love life. The humour is spot on and gels perfectly with the plot and never seems forced.<br/><br/>The plot itself is as you've probably read by now, is loosely about time-travel (not a new plot device in a trek movie, but is integral to the whole reboot thing). The main story is about Nero's revenge for the destruction of his beloved home planet of Romulus with blame squarely place on Ambassador Spock and the federation's shoulders, where it goes from there I will leave for you to find out yourselves.<br/><br/>Nimoy's return as Spock (Which I have saved for last), is also integral to the reboot, showing us that nothing will EVER be the same again."
"namideo","8","1","6","18 May 2009"," Where Star Trek has never gone before.
","So, I just saw this movie yesterday. I'm not much of a Star Trek fan. I mildly enjoyed a few of the films like The Wrath of Kahn and First Contact. Never seen the shows. I didn't really have any particular interest in seeing this new movie. The idea of an angst ridden, teenage Captain Kirk sounded silly to me. Plus, the amount of reboots that Hollywood is shoveling out these days is getting a little out of hand. However, I was asked to go see it and I thought, why not? Might be fun. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Exclamation Point! There was hardly a thing about it I didn't like. I greatly enjoyed the cast and the dynamics they brought to each of the characters. The ensemble is what makes this movie fun. Again, I never saw the original show so I was unfamiliar with many of the characters that I gathered were being portrayed in their premature forms. Example, I have heard of Scotty, but I don't have a clue hardly as to who he is. Whether or not Simon Pegg bared any resemblance to his predecessor, I don't know, but I loved him in this movie. Partially, cause I'm also a Simon Pegg fan, but nevertheless.<br/><br/>The actor who surprised me the most was Chris Pine as James T. Kirk. For some reason, I expected not to like him very much. Again, just looking at the trailer and seeing this young dude attempt to fill Shatner's shoes just sounded like a no go to me. And while I still think he bares little if any resemblance to Shatner, he's actually a good actor. He commits to it and has fun in the role. Part of my enjoyment also comes from the writing and directing. It is well done. There are so many action films these days littered with bad dialogue, and while this film does have bits that are a tad silly, it's done cleverly and it helps when you have good actors.<br/><br/>What I think surprised me the most was the reboot approach to this film. Again, there are so many reboots nowadays, between Batman Begins, Casino Royale, and a million others. This movie takes an entirely different approach. In fact, it's technically not even a reboot, it is another sequel. And the funny thing is, this isn't even revealed till half way through the movie. I was thinking that I was watching something that was entirely new and had thrown everything from before entirely out the window. And then, my perspective was completely flipped over and came crashing down on it's own head. This occurred when Leonard Nemoy came on screen, reprising his most iconic role as the lovable Mr. Spock.<br/><br/>The revelation of this film's continuity occurs when we learn that Spock has gone back in time and disrupted the space time continuum. There is a little Back to the Future in there somewhere I think. Anyway, the destiny of young Kirk and Spock has been altered. I just find this approach interesting. It is a reboot, but it isn't at the same time. Instead they've literally gone back in time and started over. At first, the idea sounds absolutely ridiculous, but this is Star Trek after all, where traveling through space and time is as ordinary as...well, I don't know, but it's common. So, the idea actually works, and works well, and if it warrants a part for Mr. Nemoy, than why the hell not? ""Live long and prosper"" used to sound kinda dorky to me, but when old Spock says this to young Kirk, it was both fitting and meaningful. Or just, awesome.<br/><br/>For my money, Star Trek (2009) gets a 5 out of 5."
"The_Amazing_Jog","9","1","6","17 May 2009"," Great Movie for all new fans
","Being someone who has never seen an episode of the show or any of the movies i went in thinking i would be completely confused with what was going on. But they actually did a fantastic job of developing the characters and making them easy to get to know. The story line was a lot simpler than i had anticipated and found myself actually knowing what was going on, much unlike how i was during the star wars films. The action sequences were excellent and the special effects were top notch. I found myself a little bored at a few points but mostly i was very entertained. The movie was very reminiscent of star wars and i suggest anybody, rather it be old fans of star trek, old fans of star wars, or newcomers to see this movie. It is a great summer movie and it is the most enjoyable action movie thus far. 8/10"
"moorek","8","1","6","17 May 2009"," Great popcorn movie but as bad as any B movie
","As a Treker I loved the movie. I'll see it again. The casting was good. The sets are well made and bright. Great effects. Just nice to see Trek on the movie screen again. But it really isn't Trek. It's fun but it's a B-science movie all the way.<br/><br/>But what is so odd is that fans will nitpick a movie to death - and this movie definitely has the nitpickers - yet we'll still say it is a great movie. Yet if this were some B movie with unknown actors or poorer special effects - we'd be jumping all over the movie as poor. Just picture some of the plot lines and try to picture them outside of Star Trek:<br/><br/>*An undisciplined kid joins space school and graduates a year earlier than most which is why he can graduate with some cadets who were already enrolled. *An enemy ship that is defined as a mining ship has the weaponry to defeat dozens of military vessels (Back story apparently explained in some comic which 99% of the movie goers did not read) *Kid is sneaked aboard the flagship, has a piece of information that coincidentally saves the ship, and is thus elevated to 2nd in command *Kid goes ballistic on the bridge, yelling at his captain, assaulting two security guards, is arrested and marooned only to take command when the other captain is considered ""emotionally compromised"" *The other captain whose planet and mother was just destroyed was taking the reasonable action of rejoining the fleet while the new kid having seen the destruction the enemy can do - decides to engage him one on one ""it's him or us"". Who is the emotionally compromised person here? *He's marooned on an ice planet with an outpost but lands 14 km away meaning he has to walk through deadly weather on a planet with carnivorous species. Even in 2009 we can land aircraft at their destination - or at least on a nearby river. Not 14 km away on an hostile planet. *This planet or moon just happens to be close enough that they can see an adjacent planet be destroyed. Yet there appears to be no affect on this planet from the sudden gravitation changes. If our moon was destroyed or even had a major orbit shift we'd have major ground changes. *He and another person transport from this planet to a ship that was traveling away at warp three for at least 10 hours. Warp 3 is 29x the speed of light so if you do the math then this ship is over a trillion miles away. And they can put themselves safely in belly of the ship. *The enemy ship is drilling into earth's core and is easily defeated by a lone ship shooting the attached tether. Even if all the starships were elsewhere, you'd think there would be some type of ship around that could attack the cable. Dig an old F14 from a museum and put missiles on it? Ram it with an explosive filled shuttlecraft? *The rest of the crew come up with the elements of the attack and rescue, the kid actually doesn't do too much planning, but when it's over and the kid rescues the old captain, the kid gets promoted again *kid goes from cadet on academic suspension to captain in a few days *and wait for it, not just captain of some small ship where he can get more experience but the captain of the Flagship. <br/><br/>I loved it. I'll see it again. But we have to remember that it is no better than most B sci-fi movies out there. And for this reason, while I loved the movie, it was less like Star Trek. Oddly the movies that have done well like II (Kahn) and IV (Voyage Home) are not unlike this. Fast paced movies with glaring loopholes and elements that make no sense. The movies that try to develop characterization or set a mood are the boring ones or too cerebral. Star Trek has been described as the latter very often and it's true. But Cadet Kirk becoming Captain Kirk in these circumstances is like Desert Water Miner Luke becoming a squadron leader and then Admiral Skywalker. Fun but nothing to think about afterward."
"Close_The_Door","8","1","6","17 May 2009"," Enthusiast
","I used to watch the TV series a lot when I was a child, but I've never liked sequels such as Next Generation, etc.<br/><br/>So, it was actually my husband, a big Star Trek fan, who brought me to watch it yesterday, and I was enthusiast : it was REALLY well done and entertaining.<br/><br/>I was actually discouraged at the beginning, because of a certain tone of ""cheesy melodrama"" which made me fear of a science-fiction B-movie, and I guess the character of villain Nero could have been worked out better and deeper.<br/><br/>However, as it went long, the film displayed a very good script, it got rhythm and humor, the special effects were very good and didn't take all the place, since the characters were generally very well constructed, not only physically alike, but also psychologically consistent with their older counterparts of the TV series - if not worked even better than the originals. <br/><br/>I especially liked young Spock, Checov and Mc Coy: they were just ADORABLE here!"
"hodgkissadam","7","1","6","17 May 2009"," Some misses, mostly hits - the franchise re-boot seems to have worked.
","JJ Abrams (Lost) breathes new life into the Star Trek franchise with this movie, blending action, suspense and character conflict with a number of time honored (pardon the pun) Trekkie conventions to satisfy old and new fans alike.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the start of the career of James Tiberius Kirk, along with the now famous crew who boldly went where no-one had gone before in the 1960's TV cult classic. Chris Pine borrows enough of Shatner's speech patterns to make the character seem familiar, but makes the role of the legendary Captain his own with a display that balances the characters determination and precociousness with energy and passion.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a fairly decent pace, although, it seemed to sag in the middle and in my opinion, became needlessly bogged down with the good ol' time travel nonsense. This is just one guy talking, but time travel is a concept this franchise should have jettisoned when it had the chance.<br/><br/>That aside, this film starts with a bang and keeps on delivering. There's some hits, and some misses, but it features plenty of action, some excellent performances and boasts a budget as big as a small country's total GDP. Whilst they pay their respects to the old timers with a tip of the hat to the previous movies and one welcome cameo from a Star Trek legend, this film is really all about the future. In creating a fresh, exciting look for the franchise, has Abrams achieved for Star Trek what Nolan did with Batman? <br/><br/>Full review here for those with an interest.<br/><br/>http://cinestuff.wordpress.com/2009/05/13/movie-review-star-trek/"
"marimbadaddy","8","1","6","17 May 2009"," Star Trek 2.0 - Sort of...
","I am a fan of all Star Trek TV series and Films; though I do not own any merchandise, uniforms, or Vulcan ears. I grew up watching TOS, adjusted to TNG, and thoroughly enjoyed the Latest Enterprise series. Though I do like the TNG the best, I do understand the significance of TOS in regards to its tackling of social issues, as well as inspiring an entire generation of engineers to produce the technology we live with today. I've never been to any Trek or Sci-fi conventions, so I am uncertain if I could be classified as a Trekkie or a Trekker, and wouldn't be insulted if someone called me either. (Some loathe being called a Trekkie.) <br/><br/>This latest Star Trek film is both incredibly awesome, and somewhat disappointing. The action is great, the actors are wonderful, the special FX are excellent. The one issue I am having a difficult time coping with is the alternate universe. In essence, though this film adopts much of TOS and Enterprise's back story, it creates an impossible paradox of time travel, as well as completely altering the Star Trek universe if they decide to further this particular plot line in future films or TV series. Though the alternate universe issue is a well used device of TOS, TNG, and Enterprise; it is creating cognitive dissonance for me to attempt to reconcile these new plot points.<br/><br/>However, the film is great, the characters are believable and real. Plus, the film is a lot of fun as we get to meet the young Kirk, Spook, Sulu, Checkov, Scotty, McCoy, and Uhura. There is a plethora of nods to TOS to satisfy everyone's inner Trekkie or Trekker, as well as plenty of new developments to increase our curiosity. My mother, who likes Star Trek well enough, but who is not anywhere close to understanding the subtleties of the alternate universe, particularly enjoyed this film too."
"cox007_526","9","1","6","17 May 2009"," Just Brilliant
","AMAZING a movie with a story, a movie I became totally engrossed in and thoroughly enjoyed- what the hell happened. This might catch on in Hollywood with any luck!! I was always a fan of the Star Trek Enterprise which has now become the Star Trek Franchise! Glued to my TV in the 70's and then the movies came out and the spin off series- it's been boldly going for some 40 odd years!. Not always capturing the imagination as this film accomplishes. So full credit to the writers etc who managed to bring something new and it is a work of genius to decide upon making a prequel to the other how many? movies that have gone before. The acting superb throughout. Excellent performances by the new generation of actors I have never heard of before -Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto who achieve strong performances as Captain James Kirk and Spock making this a believable movie in a far fetched world. and they will no doubt be seen again boldly going somewhere in the future!<br/><br/>Same again please! - a long time since I have been to the Cinema to be entertained and see acting alongside special effects blending together brilliantly. Someone should have told George Lucas when he was making the 4th Star Wars it would have made for a better movie if he got the acting to work with the special effects as this movie so brilliantly achieves. Treky fans will be overjoyed and anyone who isn't a Treky fan will be encouraged to be one."
"steinerelt","6","1","6","17 May 2009"," Star Trek with a cool touch
","Star Trek is back with a new visual overhaul that boldly shakes off all its previous incarnations with a daring, visually cool and escapist approach that appeals mainly to the senses and pleasantly switches off the mind. <br/><br/>Seeing the characters re-cast and re-introduced with this fresh, contemporary approach creates a combination of feelings: a kind of nostalgia for the ""good old"" Star Trek and an expectation with a touch of skepticism over whether the magic could be indeed re-created. <br/><br/>Even with a clever storyline, the success of any Star Trek film is bound to rely on the chemistry between the iconic crew. In spite of my initial doubts over the youthful, rebel-like depiction of Kirk, with the help of the - in this case - absolutely mandatory suspension of disbelief the cast look charmingly cool and manage to win over the sympathies of the majority of viewers. Although it will definitely fail to impress a die-hard Star Trek enthusiast for exactly the same reason, it all looks exciting and sexy again. <br/><br/>With the main characters making their appearance on the screen, one by one, their lives gradually intertwining, building up the excitement, the film reaches a charming moment in which all of them are finally set up, positioned on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise in that well-known manner, all new and ready to start again, with ties and friendships that are about to span a lifetime.<br/><br/>It all looks great and works best as an uplifting cola & pop-corn escapist spectacle, which, frankly, is what a lot of movie-goers appreciate the most.<br/><br/>The filmmakers brewed out the essence of the ""old wonder"" that was Star Trek, the essence of each of the characters and the original idea, gave it a big stir and a brand new visual overhaul. This gives the film the necessary strength and cheekiness to shake down its previous incarnations and blast it off into an alternative, shiny new space.<br/><br/>It all feels exciting, if not perhaps 100% believable, but this is, after all, a sci-fi movie and all comments about the plot's credibility would be rather pointless.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling relaxed and refreshed from how nicely this worked - it's a pleasant movie to look at for guys and girls alike.<br/><br/>The film worked and the follow-ups have an exciting youthful audience waiting for more.<br/><br/>With such loaded history, a lot could have gone embarrassingly wrong. It didn't and it proved to be a new direction for Star Trek. <br/><br/>A big recommendation for visual effects enthusiasts, popcorn munchers, if not so much perhaps for fans and fanatics."
"drdave","8","1","6","16 May 2009"," Good as a standalone movie, but does not fit in well with the rest of Star Trek
","Taken as a movie in a vacuum, this installment of Star Trek is pretty good. It's fast paced, the visuals are good and most of the characters are well cast. The story line is a bit weak in some places and there's absolutely no excuse for that. Overall, the movie is quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>However (you knew this was coming), Star Trek has been around for 40 years and you can't ignore the past -- bail out know if you don't like spoilers. Throwing out the entire time line that has been built up since 1966 was an unnecessary and ill-conceived event, unless the planned sequel somehow restores most of the previous time line. Moreover, they even did a bad job of changing the time line by having the events at the beginning of the movie occur at a stardate later than the beginning of the original series with the 30-something year old Kirk. (TOS has stardates going back to 1312.4 and the movie starts years earlier at stardate 22...something or other.) Likewise, there is no excuse for using the near-Enterprise-A version of the ship instead of something that resembled the original more, since the construction of the NCC-1701 Enterprise is before the time line change.<br/><br/>There are numerous other things that happen that don't make sense. Star Fleet would not give command of its newest star ship to a 25ish cadet. Scotty is older than Kirk, not younger ... and that happened before the time line change so the movie just got it wrong for no good reason. Likewise, Chekov is much younger and would not have been around to navigate a newly launched Enterprise. The Enterprise had much of it's layout and structure already defined. It could have been made more ""realistic"" in the movie but it should not have been dramatically changed. And finally, the whole Spock-Uhura thing makes less than no sense.<br/><br/>There was an outcry when Star Trek V had a series of improbable events that did not fit in with everything else that had gone before. Now it looks like a minor transgression.<br/><br/>Again, taken separately from the series and the other movies, this one is very good. However, given the wanton destruction of almost all that had already been established (and for no good reason!!!) , it is not possible to give this movie anything better than 8 out of 10 and that might be a stretch."
"natebouchard","8","1","6","16 May 2009"," Good but not great
","I hate to be all negative but I do agree with most people's assertions about what makes this movie good. However I think it's worth saying what makes it less than perfect:<br/><br/>The way I can describe this movie best is like a small, fancy dinner. The flavours (script, cinematography, casting, acting) were fantastic but when I was done, I didn't feel full. All that character development was great, and the slow pacing was appropriate until the movie just petered off. It felt to me like the script was for a 2.5 hour movie but they were forced to amend it and remove the last hour.<br/><br/>I say this because Nero wasn't terribly compelling as a villain. Not because Eric Bana isn't awesome but because he had very little to work with. I wanted to know more about his mind and his madness (think about what made Dark Knight so good and you'll see what I'm getting at). I was really hoping for that next ""act"" in the movie where they are about to destroy Nero only to have him get away and cause them some grief (ie. take a crew member hostage or really mess up the ship). Something to ramp up the movie so that when Nero dies the stakes are higher and we've gotten to know him a bit more (heck we could sympathize with or despise him, but neither option was developed).<br/><br/>It was the start of something great but the movie itself was not ""great"". I can see the sequel truly being amazing as this has the energy of the original with a solid execution."
"machngunjoe","5","1","6","12 May 2009"," Good Popcorn Movie, Bad for Trekies
","The trailer said it all. ""This ain't your parents Star Trek"" <br/><br/>First the Good: <br/><br/>The Special Effects were very good, lots of action, a few teary moments along with some laughs. Karl Urban was by far the most convincing rendition of the original characters, Scotty and Sulu were also very good adaptations and to those three actors they have my thanks.<br/><br/>What was also very good in my opinion, was the first 3 minutes of the movie including the intro music into the Movie Title. All of that captures me every time I watch it. Unfortunately I turn the movie off after that. <br/><br/>Now the Bad: There were many things that were not consistent with the original story, such as certain physical impossibilities in the original story that are now possible in the new installment. Also certain relationships that didn't exist before that now exist and feel a little bit abnormal. For example, love interests that would not make sense before, all of a sudden are shoved in our faces as if it is plausible. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams fixed all of these by implementing in the plot an alternate Universe, so this movie didn't have to follow anything the original series or the movie told us, which in my opinion ruins it all. It makes all the episodes and movies including all the variations are now somehow obsolete according to the new plot line.<br/><br/>I felt like that was extremely cheap, like someone had a good idea that wasn't supported by the already existing mythology of Star Trek, so they created this ridiculous parallel universe thing to make it happen.<br/><br/>There are many goofs in this film, too many to go over but the one that was sooooo obvious to me and only JJ Abrams can overlook in the editing room is the height difference between Old Spock and Young Spock. In one particular scene they stand in front of each other and Leonard Nimoy is a good 2 feet higher then young Spock. No Parallel plot line can fix that crap. <br/><br/>JJ Abrams is cheap. All his movies are basically tricks. He keeps the entire plot line of all his movies secret, makes a compelling trailer or two, and then on opening night.... the Movie sucks. Look at his filmography, most if not all of his movies were sold just like that. I sometimes say in my reviews that certain director can do no wrong. Well JJ Abrams can do no RIGHT! <br/><br/>I give it a 5 because all in all it was a very entertaining movie, and the opening scene was great. It is not a 6,7,8,9,or 10 like it should be, because of the cheap Hollywood-esk plot line.<br/><br/>Like the subject line states: Good Popcorn Movie, Bad for Trekkies I won't be buying this on DVD."
"mxbishop","7","1","6","11 May 2009"," Fun - but viewer can turn off their brain
","I like Star Trek - particularly the original show (TOS). This movie has a lot going for it. Good overall concept - and in general, excellent casting. Both Spock and McCoy give dead-on performances. But I ding the film in 3 places. First the story: How many Star Trek movies have we've seen about an alien/super-being coming for revenge? Let's see: There was Khan, Sorin, Shinzon, etc. Star Trek is best when it's cerebral - and when there's some element of discovery in the story. Think: Immunity Syndrome, or Doomsday Machine, or Corbornite Maneuver. When are we going to get a story like those? You don't need 2 hours worth of action - if you have a really good story to tell that makes us all think a little.<br/><br/>Secondly, the ship's interior design was awful. No clean lines, lots of busy, flashy, irritating equipment. The interior of a starship should be functional, understated, and give the impression of massive power under elegant, softly illuminated controls. Think McIntosh Audio equipment. The bridge, in particular, should have a futuristic-looking industrial design - without appearing like an Apple Store - as other reviewers have compared it to. Colors should be muted - noise kept to a minimum. Remember, you have to be able to think while on the bridge - you're not checking out at Best Buy. The bridge should have more of a modern cockpit feel to it I think.<br/><br/>Lastly, Abrams likes his shaky-cam. Could never watch Lost because of this. I give this movie a solid B. They need a better story to tell."
"lifwinteg","7","1","6","11 May 2009"," don't like some of the non-canon content
","Overall a pretty good movie. Don't like how the movie moves away from canon. For example how star fleet knows what the Romulans look like,(considering they physical appearance was unknown until many years later), or how Vulcan is destroyed when it is shown in Next Generation episodes. I would have also liked to see some early 23rd century Romulan or Klingon ships interact with the Narada. I am tired of film makers creating these prequels that don't follow the proper history (canon), or have them rush through a film. Why do they do this? But again the movie had great special effects and the characters were well done. A fairly good movie with some minor flaws. Recommend it, but would like to see a sequel that fixes the time line. I would also like to see a Romulan War movie!"
"zterrell","8","1","6","11 May 2009"," Better than expected...except for Bourne nonsense film work.
","Yes, we (my wife and I) watched Star Trek when it was first released to television. The hokey costumes, the plastic phasers, the cardboard looking sets...it still beat most Sci-Fi of its time. We enjoyed the movies...Khan, the whales and the final conflict; but didn't care for the New Generation series, nor the second or third installments for television. We went to this with mediocre expectations and were, for the most part, pleasantly surprised. Not for the overall plot, but for the development of the characters we had known for so many years. Other than a relationship which had never been brought forward and a girlish replacement for Chekov, the characters were believable and entertaining. Our singular complaint was the filming. As with practically every movie made since the 2nd Bourne movie, the directors insist on sticking the camera up so close to the action that it's impossible to watch -- not only can't you see what is going on, it will give you a headache from eye strain if you try. For goodness sake, wake up, Directors! If Cecil B DeMille had filmed the Ten Commandments that way he would have ended up a bum begging on the streets. As for those nay-sayers decrying this movie was a bust, perhaps they went with different expectations. What we saw was a new beginning with familiar characters. I'm not sure what else you might have expected."
"billnich-1","1","1","6","11 May 2009"," Time continuum plot ruins it
","Star Trek was an exciting and enjoyable reviving of the franchise. However, why do we have to go and re-write the back story in order to make it interesting? Are we now to assume that all of the ""Future"" (i.e. previous) Star Trek episodes and movies are irrelevant because (spoilers) Vulcan is no longer there, Amanda is no longer there (end spoilers), thereby omitting many of the more enjoyable episodes of both the television and movie series which have yet to occur from the perspective of this film and now never will because of it? It would be nice to see if in future Star Trek films the writers do not resort to time travel, alternative time-lines, rewriting history, re-writing back stories in order to create and solve every problem that pops up for the crew of the Enterprise.<br/><br/>Enjoy it for what it is - fun film, great cast. The plot could have been better, where we would have gotten to know familiar characters in their earlier years, without rewriting their history as a part of the plot."
"c_degner","7","1","6","11 May 2009"," Wiping the slate clean
","It's understandable how die hard Trek fans would be disappointed in this movie. I wasn't. This definitely was NOT my Father's 'Star Trek.'<br/><br/>It was good to see how some of the characters began and interesting to see now how the loss of a parent to Kirk and Spock would add some strength to their soon to be friendship. I was a little disappointed in Kirk's Kobyashi Maru test. I was hoping they'd go more from the book of the same title where Kirk reprograms the simulation to have the Klingon's cowering at his feet when they discover they were firing upon ""THE Captain James T. Kirk"" and subsequently offering assistance to help.<br/><br/>I thought it was good how the writers stuck to character canon. With the death of Kirk's father, we see a ballsier, more confident/ cockier, borderline arrogant Kirk, possibly ""acting out"" in his early years over anger at how he lost his father or knowing the heroic deed he did giving his life to save his crew. What I didn't know about was Kirk's genius, pointing out how his test scores were off the charts. The use of Leonard Nimoy to bridge both universes was also a cool idea.<br/><br/>I've read people pan the use of ""Red Matter"" but come on, folks, this is science FICTION. We don't know what they'll come up with four hundred years from now. I mean, cell phones looking like communicators and just about everyone uses blue tooth which looks a lot like Uhura's ear piece these days.<br/><br/>Some of the things complained about in other reviews are trivial. Kirk ""drafted"" McCoy in TMP to get him on board the Enterprise, only fitting McCoy would use a Starfleet regulation to get Kirk on. Fast promotions? I've seen and heard of promotions simply by handing a leader a pen when he had none while I served in the military. Pike knew Kirk's potential and it could also be a matter of ""right person in the right place at the right time"" when he promoted him to First Officer, which Spock didn't know about when he had him removed from the ship. Granted someone could have spoken up, but if you get caught up in the moment, you tend to forget.<br/><br/>Kirk had to mutiny. It was for the safety of the ship and crew and it was his duty to show Spock he was emotionally compromised. Anything less would have been a dereliction. Besides, we've always known Kirk was a bit of a maverick; he offered assistance to the crew of the enemy ship but was refused, and since the writers felt we need a good space battle we got to see some cool special effects. <br/><br/>Using a cadet crew to chase a villain? They did that in ST2 and no one seemed to mind. Sometimes trial by fire is the best way to learn, and learn to perform under pressure. Experience is the best teacher. Had Sulu known how to pilot, they might have been destroyed with the rest of the Federation ships and let's not forget the Kilngon armada wiped out by the Nerada.<br/><br/>So, to me, the slate is wiped clean, and they can take the franchise into a totally different direction. The characters stayed true to canon, although seeing Spock's interaction with his father admitting ""I married your mother not just because it was logical, but because I loved her."" was a refreshing new twist, admitting they have emotions rather than staunchly repressing them, and I feel that gave Sarek more strength. <br/><br/>Spock will always be a child of two worlds, so we get/ got to see him embrace his human half a bit better, like the Spock of Star Trek 2. He wasn't rigidly cold and logical in that movie, but calmer, more at peace with his human half, and I liked seeing that in this movie; from both Spocks. Zachary Quinto performed well in the role. Chris Pine had Shatner's arm swagger down, Karl Urban was brilliant as McCoy, Simon Pegg gave a good rendition as Scotty, and Anton Yelchin did well as Chekov. (I find it funny people panned him or his Russian accent, and he's from Russia in real life.)<br/><br/>In essence, this movie showed us (well, me, anyway) that we can never know what repercussions came about once certain things are set in motion (the aforementioned destruction of Kirk's father and his ship, the Kelvin) but also sometimes destiny plays a hand in that each of the characters still get together on the Federation flagship to boldly go where no one has gone before.<br/><br/>For those extra critical of the script, I offer you a quote from the movie:<br/><br/>""I dare you to do better."""
"TwoTooth","7","1","6","11 May 2009"," We got the daredevil, but where's the explorer?
","I enjoyed the movie, dubious black holes, plot holes, and all. But... It was a bit relentless about checking off the to-do list of references (in jokes, mostly) and quotations. Most of the variations in character competencies, motivations, and relationships were justified and interesting for future reference.<br/><br/>But even allowing for the requirements of the plot, this Kirk is pretty much a stock action hero with no hint of the curiosity that made him interesting in his previous incarnation (and was a far more sympathetic reason than common bar brawls for him to get into trouble).<br/><br/>And I haven't seen such improbable promotions since the Rebel Alliance made Han Solo a general in Return of the Jedi."
"Animus","8","1","6","10 May 2009"," Story good, science bad
","Overall I enjoyed the movie very much, it was a good story which allowed the series to be ""rebooted"" rather than try to keep up with 40 years of back story, character history and confusion. Replacing the actors and some of the well know historical events was a challenge but it was well met. My only complaint is the science part of the fiction took a beating in this film, I try not to get too picky about sci-fi tech (dumping the warp core means warp drive stops right?) and the often used time travel plot device is getting real old in Trek. But I believe you have to acknowledge real universe physics and some things bugged me about this film that were just hard to ignore (science!). The basic plot about the Romulan twin home worlds being destroyed by a supernova was a big ""HUH???"" moment. If a star went supernova close enough to the planets to destroy them via shock wave then I can only see 2 possibilities; either it was their own star and preventing the shock wave from devastating the worlds buys you a day at best before the worlds freeze solid or it was a star that had drifted close enough to the Romulan home system to threaten them and then stopping the shock wave just means everyone dies from gargantuan levels of radiation poisoning and disruption of the orbital path as other worlds in the system get pulverized and stellar center of gravity shifts. The ""red matter"" was very vague stuff, where did it come from? Why did a single drop create a black hole? Where did the Vulcans get that much? Why did using 10,000 times as much at the end not create a super-massive black hole? Then there's the planet/moon Spock prime was marooned on which was close enough to Vulcan that you could watch the world die without optical aids yet wasn't affected by the black hole being that close by."
"anarresa","6","1","6","10 May 2009"," Incredible Effects, Questionable Resurrection
","This film really has two different views, how good a movie it is and how good a Star Trek resurrection it is. As a movie it's a fun big-budget action film. The effects were incredible, exactly what every movie should aspire to emulate. Computer effects were used where necessary and attention was paid to the detail so it never detracted from the story. Physical effects/action were used where they would be best appreciated and would help to keep the audience (and actors) in the story. The plot was coherent enough for enjoyment, though it was clearly an action film and not a drama. I'm not sure how humorous it would be if you're not familiar with the Star Trek characters, but there were enough little tidbits just for the fun of it that everyone should get at least a chuckle or two. Highly recommended if you are looking for a good shoot 'em up time. If you're a big Trek fan, I (and my mother, also a big Trek fan) thought these characters were very believable as the younger selves of the original icons. All the necessary nods were included and most of the humor stemmed from this. That said, I'm not sure I could ever watch another film with these characters. The story veered greatly from the original history and some of the branches are just a little too weird for my fan comfort (I'm sure someone with spoilers will make mention of these few oddities). I liked having this glimpse into their youth but if any future movie is made I hope they will place new characters into this universe with the same style, careful action and fun."
"DanaKerim","8","1","6","10 May 2009"," Star Trek was pulled off the shelf only to be shoved onto a Hollywood factory line
","THE GOOD <br/><br/>As anyone could tell from the trailers, the quality of the CG is mind blowing, seeing these visuals on the big screen constantly for 2 hours was absolutely thrilling. I caught myself in awe quite frequently. They took an interesting approach to the transporter effect, making it seem more organic than electric like the old shimmering style popularized by The Next Generation. The actors are quite young, but it suits the story as they are literally flying by the seat of their pants for half the movie, which adds a lot of excitement to the adventure. The pace of the movie is quite fast, jumping gaps of years as much as the first 10 minutes of Fallout3, but the pace and choice of years shown in the characters lives were appropriate and played to the overall story well. The sound was specifically revamped before the film was finished in production, and it really shows. From the sound of the bridge bleeps, to the booming gunshot like blast of the Enterprise going to warp, it's an absolute feast for the ears. There is an excellent cameo appearance by Leonard Nimoy, and the way in which the film passes the torch from the old generation to the new is perfectly encompassed in the closing scene to the film in which Nimoy gives a monologue as the Enterprise drifts powerfully across the screen, the monologue is of course the popular intro speech in The Original Series, though there were minor changes made to the words. The ship goes to warp, and I'll be honest, I knew that's how they were going to end it, but I still loved that moment to death, as a Trek fan, it was monumental. The characters are portrayed well with little to complain about, catching the moments of obvious reference to lines the characters would say was a treat. There was at least ONE time when I expected Spock to just start cutting someones head open with his mind bullets (IE Sylar) but other than that, Zachary Quinto did a surprisingly acceptable job at not reminding me of Sylar, as far as portraying Spock, well this is his own take on it, and it isn't uncanny but it works. Chekov and Sulu are pretty alright, Scotty is as lovable as always, and even has an alien sidekick. Kirk was basically as I would have expected him to be, a cocky young American boy with no fear and a lot of attitude, HOORAW! And overall I bought Chris Pines performance. The plot didn't focus much on the villain, which I somewhat liked, since the villain does enough to get noticed such as blowing up planets, also it leaves more plot time to just be Star Trek and not heehaw America kill them space terrorists story that we all know so well.<br/><br/>THE BAD <br/><br/>Ugh, it really is just an action movie with the Star Trek stamp of approval. As an action film it does a pretty great job of keeping the audience compelled, but sometimes there is simply too much fighting and action, and not enough thought process involved in taking in the scenes. I know this movie is supposed to cater to a wider audience, but that's just a wider audience of easily impressed yuppies. For Trek fans, it was perhaps too action packed. The acting was charming and suitable, but nothing special. A big disappointment was that while Majel Barrett was apparently cast as the computer voice, as was the standard for all other Star Trek franchises before this movie, the recognizable quality of her voice didn't show at all, it sounded nothing like her, what a slap in the face. My biggest problem with the movie is the writing. The film was written by the same individuals who wrote Transformers (2007) and oh boy does it show. Star Treks opening scene is a man on duty facing certain death and just discovered he has a baby, Transformers opening scene is a man on duty facing certain death and just discovered he has a baby. Then the character introductions, and so on, I don't want to spoil too much, but watch transformers then watch Star Trek, you'll see what I mean. Lastly, not a big deal really, but the way Kirk meets old Spock is a littleÂ… unlikely to say the least.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION <br/><br/>When you get right down to it, it is just the recycled plot of Transformers with changes made to look like a Trek movie, and for that sake I'm not sure if this film is anymore enduring than that one; For example, at first everyone thought it was amazing, but eventually realized beyond it being on the big screen and visually high budget, It's just a mess. Star Treks story is a little more acceptable no doubt due to the HIGH HIGH HIGH expectations of the fans, Transformers didn't have nearly that much expectation, however the plot in my opinion had little time to develop as an acceptably good Star Trek story. Don't get me wrong though, it's a fun ACTION PACKED adventure, but watching it, you can tell that behind those glossy effects, and the frequent dose of Star Trek reference, it's just another Hollywood movie that came off a factory line. So no it isn't the movie that will rise Star Trek from the ashes, it just put those ashes on display on top of a very expensive stage. I apologize if I haven't gone into as much detail about it as you would have liked me to, but since it came out only days ago from my point of view writing this review, I don't want to give away too much. So go see it in theaters for the big screen wow affect, enjoy, and most importantly, live long and prosper.<br/><br/>1000 word limit sucks by the way"
"michaellaing71","6","1","6","10 May 2009"," Boldly going forward, but not by much.
","The review for Star trek have been very good, so I went into the film with high hopes. Unfortunately I must say that I was disappointed and thought the film was no better than average.<br/><br/>The film has lots of action and does try and a interesting plot idea but over all it but the script is a bit ham fisted, clumsy and pretty predictable. Most of the acting is good and none of the characters is unlikeable. The two characters that shine for me are Bruce Greenwood who plays Captain Pike extremely well and Zoe Saldana who is great a Uhura. Zachary Quinto is quite good as Spock and Chris Pine is fine as Kirk though he seems to lack the personality of William Shatner. The one annoying character for me is Simon Pegg as Scotty, he just is so over the top that it gets annoying and his character seems to be being played for laughs. I liked Eric Banner as the bad guy Nero, he doesn't come over as the normal bad guy. He under plays the character and comes over as just a average guy but with a extremely powerful weapon.<br/><br/>I cannot say I am a fan of the JJ Abrams direction, he uses a lot of hand held jerky camera work which is annoying at time. I also got very annoyed with the action scenes, especially the space battles. There is just to much going and crowded. This isn't helped by the fast editing and the cinematography which had lots of close ups just was frustrating. I must admit that the special effects were of a very high quality which shows that by giving a film enough time to get certain things right, it can improve the film greatly.<br/><br/>I have to say one of the weakest elements of the film is the music, the score is weak especially when compared some of the great Star Trek films scores. It completely fails to add to the film and is a huge let down. I thought the set design was OK I got annoyed by a couple of things and the bridge of the Enterprise looked like it had been designed by Macintosh. Which brings me to another really annoy and rather silly thing thing in the film. Product placement just doesn't work well in far future science fiction films and looks completely out of place in a Star Trek film. I just found it irritating and completely out of place.<br/><br/>I have done a lot of moaning about the film and there is a lot of negative things to say about the film but the film is not terrible. I found it to be generally harmless and some times funny but with a lot of annoying little bits which reduced what I thought could have been a great film. I am glad Star Trek is back and hopefully the sequels will be really good. If you want to see a average Trek film go and see this film, if you want to see a great Trek film go and Watch The Wrath of Khan."
"ArtLinklater","7","1","6","9 May 2009"," A non-whining fanboy speaks out
","A $9 movie. (I like to rate a movie by how much I would have wanted to spend to see it, not some arbitrary scale.)<br/><br/>It will fit nicely on the shelf between Starship Troopers and Wing Commander.<br/><br/>I'm what one might call a Star Trek fanboy, I watched the original series religiously, I enjoyed The Motion Picture, I even have two editions of the FASA game (because shuttles don't carry phasers Task Force!).<br/><br/>This new movie was entertaining (not so much as Shoot Em Up or Crank, but more so than Transporter 2 or Treks 3,5,6,7,8,9 and 10). My main criticism about its entertainment value was that it did seem to rely very heavily on physical violence (lots of explosions and fisticuffs) and less on mental violence (when do the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many?). <br/><br/>It seems that the script was written fairly shallow and the pretty explosions were there to try to hide that. Still, this is forgivable considering the shallowness of society in general and perhaps its a very deliberate comment on the qualities of society - a comment on how decades ago we were entertained by challenges to how we thought about the world and perceived those around us that were different but now all we need are some pretty baubles and we're very happily distracted from having to think.<br/><br/>Still it was entertaining.<br/><br/>The actors chosen did a remarkable job fitting themselves into roles that had been so well worn over time. They were able to breathe life into the familiar, even stale, concepts and gave them a more vibrant life than they've had since the original series aired.<br/><br/>Incidentally the only character that isn't played the same way is done so because of the actor's own conceit and yet it plays very deliberately into the plot device that powers the movie. Kirk acts differently because his life IS different.<br/><br/>So that introduces the plot device. Many have complained about time travel being overused and contrived but its a device that works and should be accepted because it carries with it an accepted logic.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the continuity problems and changes in canon that have little to be explained by the changes caused by time traveling vengeful Romulans and the death of two Star Fleet captains (George Kirk and Robau) and the destruction of one Star Fleet vessel (the Kelvin).<br/><br/>How did the loss of those two lives and that one ship explain: -the adoption of hand phasers 4 years early? -the design changes of the Constitution Class vessels (of which Enterprise was one) -character ages being changed (Chekov was born earlier, Spock was born later and I'm pretty sure Kirk was supposed to be entering the Academy when Pike was taking the Enterprise out for its first 5 year mission so he was born at least 3 years early, although perhaps the Enterprise was commissioned 3 years later than in canon<br/><br/>The only conceivable explanation that I can think of is that Star Fleet spent so much money searching for the Narada that the construction and commissioning of the Enterprise was pushed back 5 years. That's the only thing that makes sense and yet it wasn't brought up in the movie. A little aside like ""We're finally getting her launched."" would have explained it.<br/><br/>Of course it doesn't help explain why the engineering deck of the enterprise has so many huge pipes all of a sudden. It doesn't explain why the bridge has so many breakables, protrusions and a big freaking window. It also doesn't explain why Star Fleet is equipping its Heavy Cruisers with the power controls from a 25 foot inboard Bayliner.<br/><br/>I'm sure Michael Bay (sorry JJ Abrams) could explain those, but I doubt he cares, really, I wouldn't."

The technical geeks will tear it apart, I am sure, but those of us who have enjoyed the stories of the NCC 1701 for the past 40 years, and the other shows that have spun off from it. This cast blended so well together, without even the character being introduced by name, you knew who it was. Bones, Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, Ohura, sigh....I want to see it again."
"jasonford1987","8","1","6","9 May 2009"," Excellent movie, although I have some qualms.
","As a comparatively casual Trekkie, for me the Original Series is the epitome of the franchise. Everything about Star Trek that is noteworthy and definitive is to be found in those very first three seasons. The most prevalent quality being that it was a true science fiction story. The episodes were even written by legitimate science fiction writers.<br/><br/>It did have flaws, obviously the most noticeable being the low budget and often laughable effects. Abrams' Star Trek makes up for that plenty.<br/><br/>Some of the qualities that these two Star Trek universe dualities share is a strong cast and emotional substance. The latter of which being something that the Original Series melded with science fiction ""braininess"" quite aptly, for me. The prime example of this being the very first Star Trek pilot episode, ""The Cage."" Abrams' movie could have recreated that rare mix of attributes had it stayed a bit closer to Star Trek's true science fiction roots. Unfortunately though I think it wondered too far into the realm of crowd pleasing. Don't get me wrong, I admire that Abrams has made Star Trek accessible to way more people than anyone would have thought. It's stupid to condemn that accomplishment. However, I think it could have been accomplished without leaping away from science fiction and into space opera.<br/><br/>Yes, it was an amazing movie. Did it feel like Star Trek should, to me? No. The one thing that captivates me about the Original Series is that in spite of the low budget and the corny effects, it was clever. Every episode (okay maybe save a few... like that one episode with the giant cat? wow.), was intelligent. And it always pulled me in even in the midst of that paper thin set. Abrams' movie does have good character development as well as some commendable plot elements. But it lacks the intelligence, cleverness, and true science fiction feel of what Star Trek is all about.<br/><br/>So again, amazing movie. I will no doubt own a copy as soon as possible and will definitely enjoy watching it several more times. But when I need a real Star Trek/sci-fi fix? I'll still be breaking out you guessed it, do I even have to say it? The Original Series."

"MovieMen2005","9","1","6","9 May 2009"," Trek is Back
","Let me first when I heard J.J. Abrahms' idea of rebooting TOS crew with younger actors for a prequel, I was worried. With the exception of Batman and Bond, recharging a franchise can be a major mistake. Fear not. Abrahms has done as remarkable a job on Trek as Nolan did with Batman. Star Trek is Back. Is the movie perfect? Of course not. Is it the best Trek Film ever? Almost. My personal favorite is WOK(Wrath of Khan to non-Trekkers). After that, First Contact. The simply titled Star Trek is what Long-time fans like myself have been waiting for and deserve for our patience. Kirk, Spock and McCoy were flawless. The time-travel story element is bold even for Trek and Abrahms brilliantly acknowledges and moves with it within the movie, meaning that the characters realize what has happened and move forward with it. Small spoiler--It's Spock that verbally acknowledges the situation and what it means to the crew. Very nicely done. Other directors might have let it slide leaving you wondering what it means, but Abrahms puts it in his characters' laps and makes them take it with themselves. By the last ten minutes of it, you realize that other directors may not have had the integrity and style to do Trek justice. I was concerned as well going in to see it, but rest assured that what you have heard about the opening sequence involving the USS Kelvin is 100% accurate. I almost cried. Really. The last thing I will say is even my wife liked it and she doesn't do Trek. The only Trek she has seen has been with me on TV. She is very hard to impress with movies and she thought it was awesome. If I hadn't already seen it, and heard what she said, I would go see it. P.S. Mr. Abrahms--From a lifelong Trekkie(I turned 30 last year), after waiting 7 years from the DOA Nemesis and hoping Trek could find a new lease on life as Chris Nolan did with Batman, I am proud to say once again that I am a Trekkie. You've done with Trek what most people, including myself did not think you could do. You've made us want more. Thank you for your vision and your integrity, and, above all, give us more Star Trek."

","The 2009 STAR TREK reboot is amazing and J.J. Abrams did a very good job with this movie and I like it.<br/><br/>The story of the 2009 reboot follows James T. Kirk and Spock aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero, a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The story also takes place in alternate reality due to time travel by both Nero and the original Spock.<br/><br/>The alternate timeline was created in an effort to free the film and the franchise established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving the original story elements.<br/><br/>The film is directed by J.J. Abrams (who also produced Cloverfield, directed it's sequel, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS, Mission Impossible III and the upcoming seventh STAR WARS film saga, EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS) with a screenplay written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Fringe, The Legend of Zorro, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Cowboys and Aliens, Mission: Impossible III) and they really did a good job with a good screenplay and direction.<br/><br/>I love this story and even though I have seen only three of the films, STAR TREK III: THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK, STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME and STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER, I did not know what STAR TREK was, but I knew what STAR WARS was and it was really fantastic.<br/><br/>So, I had the guts to watch this movie and I thought I would end up saying, ""What in the hell did I just watch?"", but after it ended, I said ""That was fantastic. I hope there is a sequel to this movie someday."" and there is. I will watch the sequel and then I will review it.<br/><br/>The character development and storyline were really amazing and fantastic and extraordinary, man. It is just amazing and fantastic to see this movie last year in 2014 on FXX and I recorded it from my DVR and watched it and thought it was cool.<br/><br/>Chris Pine plays James Kirk and he is amazing, as well as Zachary Quinto playing Spock, the younger version and the late Leonard Nimoy as Prime Spock. Eric Bana plays the villain Nero wonderfully. The rest of the cast that includes John Cho as Sulu, Ben Cross as Spock's father, Sarek, Bruce Greenwood as Admiral Pike, Simon Pegg as Scotty, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy, Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov, Winona Ryder as Spock's mother and Zoe Saldana as Uhura all deliver great performances and there are some minor appearances by the film as well.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth, yes, Thor is in this movie as Kirk's dad, George Kirk, Jennifer Morrison as Kirk's mother, Winona Kirk, Rachel Nichols as Gaila, Deep Roy as Scotty's assistant and Tyler Perry as the head of Starfleet Academy, Admiral Richard Barnett and they all do a really good job.<br/><br/>The visual effects, sound design and makeup are really amazing in this film and I am surprised that the make-up won an Oscar at the 82nd Academy Awards. The film is well shot and I give credit to Daniel Mindel, who does a good job in this film. The music by Michael Giacchino was really cool and I liked his musical scores for Super 8, The Incredibles and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which I reviewed also on here.<br/><br/>This movie really deserved that critical acclaim and the critics took this movie really seriously, but also said that this film polarized some Star Trek fans and this film is just amazing in every way.<br/><br/>STAR TREK gets a 10 out 10 from me."

So seeing how Sylar from Heroes was playing Spock, it completely threw me away! Especially as there were lots of moments where you could see the ""Sylar acting style"" in the young version of Spock.<br/><br/>So, first of all, i was really thrown back by who played the younger version of Spock. Secondly, there were way too many random pointless scenes that just ruined the movie even more. For example, the girl feeling sorry and just starts making-out with Spock! We didn't need to see a girl attempt to have pity sexy with the younger version of Spock, even if it was foreshadowing the removal of his position. Finally, the Romulans... OMFG!!! They looked Like freaking BIKER GANGS! So, WTF! They totally ruined the entire Romulan race in that movie... by making them look like stupid biker gangs.<br/><br/>However, i'll give points for the special effects, because i think that is the first time in any star trek movie, that they've made a space ship actually look somewhat as big as in the inside as the outside, especially in the water treatment plant scene *where they are running through it*"

","Alright, I think I would like to rewrite my review of this movie. While, I still think this is the greatest movie I have ever seen. I should be a little more thorough of this review.<br/><br/>This movie is great for the people who are new to the franchise, Star Trek The Original Series, and certain types of fans of that series as well. However, lots of hardcore fans were not satisfied with this movie at all, and I can see why.<br/><br/>The storyline has lots of continuity problems, but I guess they can get away with it since it is an ""Alternate Universe"". There were also some references to other series that, was also unforgivable towards them (you'd know what I'm talking about if you saw it). There was also one scene that aggravated them the most (I personally found it weird a little, but overall I didn't mind it). I'm talking about a little Spock/Uhura scene (Since I've mentioned it I'm putting a spoiler warning just in case). I'm not going to say what happened, I'll just say that it was pretty much the oddest scene in the whole movie. There just wasn't enough chemistry going on between them for it to happen. Plus, there wasn't any world issues being addressed at all. There was also a lot of lens flares, but I didn't let that bother me.<br/><br/>I guess since I got all the negative things out of the way, I'll start with the positive things. What I really admired most about this movie was, how well the cast of characters was (On a personal note, I find some of them really handsome). All of the cast pretty much look like, younger actors of The Original Series. They also portrayed their characters really well (Captain Kirk talked in full sentences this time). On the other hand, I've also really enjoyed the special effects, and can see why they won ""Best Make-up"" at the Oscars. The thing I've enjoyed the most about this movie was the experience of seeing it with my Best Friend, and all those mixed emotions while we saw it together. I experienced feelings of joy, excitement, happiness, and arousal.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a perfect 10 because, I personally had no problems with it. Yes, I've stated problems above but, those are only problems that a hardcore fan might find. Not a devoted ""Trekkie"" like myself, or a person new to the series."

","I was a little put out by the special effects extravaganza and the childhood scenes of Spock and Kirk at the beginning, and thought, ""Oh no. This is going to be a long two hours."" Then Doctor Leonard McCoy showed up and I started to enjoy it. From the middle of the movie on, I had a silly grin on my face. I was utterly full of joy. Since I was four years old, I've loved Spock, Kirk, Bones, Chekhov, Sulu, Uhura, Scotty, and this movie brought them all back to life in an amusing and satisfying way--which I did not think possible. Of course, the Romulan threat, with the intense Eric Bana as the menacing Nero, was as formidable an enemy as always. Simon Pegg's Scotty was humorous and his Scottish accent was perfectly over the top. Leonard Nimoy as the future Spock seemed a little contrived at first, put there to please us old Trekkies, but in the end, I was convinced that he was needed. I can see that the film would be enjoyable to people who'd never seen a Star Trek film in their lives, but I can't help but feel sorry for them because they couldn't possibly get just how clever these film makers were in their casting, directing, effects, etc. to give a classic a face-lift without making it look like plastic.<br/><br/>A Fun, Fun film!"

","I give this movie a 10 because I enjoyed it as much as my favorite Star Trek movie in the past which was Star Trek IV. I am a die-hard Trekker and I lived through the original series and loved watching the characters portrayed in their youth. I liked them all except Zachary Quinto. I feel he was a bad choice to play Spock. I think it was a popularity choice. I am not one of his fans and I feel they should have chosen someone taller and more gaunt looking. There was something about the way he portrayed Spock that didn't give the feel of the character. I have personally never cared for this actor and really feel he did NOT fit the part. I was surprised at how they portrayed Ohura but I liked the actress they chose. In my opinion, the choice of the actor to play Kirk was outstanding in every way. He and Eric Bana in my opinion made the movie, not to mention all the outstanding visual effects. There was no way anyone could get bored watching this offering of Star Trek. It hailed the old but it respectfully portrayed the new. I hope they will make more movies of the early years. One last mention is Bruce Greenwood which I think is a great unsung actor. He always adds class to any movie he is in, in my opinion whether a good or bad character. The part of Christopher Pike was perfect for him. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe Quinto will grow on me if they make anymore movies with the younger characters, but it won't keep me from going to see the films if they choose to make any more."
"hnt_dnl","8","1","7","26 August 2009"," Star Trek...Rebooted!
","The original STAR TREK series was a TV landmark. The series ran only 3 seasons, but is now perhaps the most cult of all series of all time! Grounded in character, ideas, and stories, it is a classic. Can you re-create that magic? Yes, with STAR TREK 2009! Thanks primarily goes to TV creator J. J. Abrams (LOST, ALIAS), who directed this exciting, smart, fast-paced, thrilling adventure film.<br/><br/>A Romulan ship, the Narada, comes from the future. The ship's captain, Nero, played with appropriate Star Trek villainy by the excellent Eric Bana (MUNICH), is looking for Ambassador Spock. Nero destroys the USS Kelvin in his search and kills the Captain, but not before its First Officer George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) makes the ultimate sacrifice by remaining on the ship to allow escape shuttles to get away. Kirk's wife (played by HOUSE's Jennifer Morrison) is having a baby and they name him James Tiberius Kirk.<br/><br/>Flash forward: we see how Kirk and Spock grow up on their respective planets and end up at Starfleet Academy. Kirk is played by Chris Pine and Spock by Zachary Quinto and both these actors are revelations in these iconic roles! I had SERIOUS doubts going in, but they both sold me! Pine captures Kirk's bravado and cheekiness, while Quinto channels Spock's inner turmoil of being half-Vulcan, half-human. But neither is quite the Kirk and Spock we all know from the TOS because this is their EARLY story when both just are finishing up at Starfleet, so we get to see doubt, uncertainty and youthful indiscretion from the two men.<br/><br/>On the way to Starfleet, Kirk meets fellow cadets Dr. Leonard McCoy (an astonishingly good Karl Urban, who both looks, acts, and sounds like DeForrest Kelley!) and Uhura (a perky, but underused Zoe Saldana, who I found to be the really only annoying and unconvincing replacement; Saldana reminds me NOTHING of Nichelle Nichols!). Three years into their Starfleet training, the almost-officers are all commissioned early aboard the newly christened USS Enterprise due to reports of a mysterious ship destroying planets (Nero's Narada of course!). Captain Christopher Pike (excellent work by great veteran actor Bruce Greenwood) christens the Enterprise on its maiden voyage/mission and makes Spock his First Officer. Kirk had to sneak on board due to being on academic probation for suspicion of cheating on the infamous Kobayashi Maru test! At the piloting and navigation controls are Lt. Sulu (solid John Cho) and Ensign Chekov (winningly played by Anton Yelchin).<br/><br/>Nero orders Pike to board the Narada the same way he ordered the Kelvin Captain 25 years earlier, but Pike has Kirk, Sulu, and another officer to chute down to Vulcan to destroy Nero's detonating drill that is to deploy the matter that will destroy Vulcan. Kirk and Sulu survive, but can't destroy the drill and are beamed back up. Spock beamed down to save his parents and the Council, but his mother didn't make it and now he is conflicted. Kirk has a plan to stop Nero and save Pike, but Spock won't listen, Kirk defies orders, and Spock has him put on a Starfleet outpost on an ice planet.<br/><br/>On the planet, Kirk finds none other than Ambassador Spock from TOS! Leonard Nimoy, who created one of the most unique, memorable characters in TV history, resumes the role of Mr. Spock here to great effect! He explains to young Kirk that Nero's arrival 25 years ago created an alternate timeline and that he must return to take command of the Enterprise, his destiny. Spock created ""red matter"" to destroy a Supernova aimed for Romulus. Too late to save the planet, he still deployed the matter to destroy the nova, but instead the matter-nova combination created a time portal which shot The Narada and Spock's ships into the past (The Narada 25 years earlier than Spock). Nero, after destroying the Kelvin, waited for Spock, put him on the ice planet so he could see Vulcan destroyed.<br/><br/>Kirk and old Spock find the station and meet Montgomery Scott (played with hilarity by the wonderful Simon Pegg from SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ), a Starfleet Engineer stationed on the ice planet. Old Spock informs Scotty that he created the formula for Transwarp drive and so Scotty uses it to beam Kirk and himself to the Enterprise, where Kirk compels young Spock to relinquish command due to his emotional conflict. Now, with Kirk the Captain, the crew brainstorms and forms the plan to take down Nero.<br/><br/>The thing that I like about this reboot is that anything can happen now! It has effectively changed a lot of things in the Star Trek universe, so that this new series is no longer confined to the universe of TOS or any of its sequels. It's not your daddy's Star Trek! The casting choices are really uncanny. As a stand alone film, STAR TREK 2009 is a nonstop thrill ride. You barely have time to breathe, but yet somehow you still are able to connect just enough to these iconic characters and feel for them. <br/><br/>I did have a few questions about some potential inconsistencies in the the alternate reality and my knowledge of TOS, but it's entirely possible that the alternate reality that Nero created 25 years earlier can explain some most, if not all, these things. I still say that STAR TREK 2009 works!"

","When you grow up a Star Wars fan, you probably think that no other sci-fi film would do as good. Luckily,we were all proved wrong when Star Trek hit theaters a couple of months ago.This film is not only an incredible reboot, but the beginning of a whole new story, a whole new setting, and the introduction to a lot of things we have not seen before in Star Trek.<br/><br/>Chris Pine is great as Captain Kirk, you can really spot the William Shatner in him, and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock is my favorite of the cast. He is so much like Leonard Nimoy, you can barely tell them apart. We are also introduced to a new villain called Nero, a time traveling Romulan that comes from the future into the past to seek revenge on the United Federation of Planets.<br/><br/>There are also new things that were not yet explored in Star Trek, like Scotty's past, the creation of black holes through red matter, the newly enhanced Enterprise, and Old Spock meeting Young Spock.<br/><br/>Overall, Star Trek is an awesome film, and a new beginning that will surely bring a lot of action packed Star Trek adventures in the near future."
"jzappa","7","1","7","28 July 2009"," The Forceful Relationship Between Entertainment Cinema and Its Audiences.
","J.J. Abrams is, as has been made quite evident by now, a time traveler at heart, a heart which loves everything old: old faces, old times, old manners, old franchises. In an age when cinema has become entirely its own storytelling beast, its own approach to manifesting drama, the more accustomed acting for the camera being less and less drawn from the theatre, one greatly admires the work of actors like Chris Pine, the malleable concrete which forms the basis of Captain Kirk's reconstruction, and Zachary Quinto, who has a look of infinite dexterity in his obvious physical proclivity for Spock, who don't have to bounce around and reel off monologues ridden with words accentuated on paper with all caps, instead utilizing the great amount of character in their faces. They are never uninteresting. But before I allow you to conclude that my point is that this new Star Trek reboot is a unique, unadulterated piece of talent free from its interrelations of media bondage, it should be made clear that it is a big ""Hey, how ya doin'?"" for Trekkies, much of the impact of the story being implicit to followers of the half-century franchise. To boot, the film's highly creative director J.J. Abrams, perhaps due to the lion's share of his career having been spent in epic TV projects, directs this starter-up as if it were the pilot to an all-new Star Trek TV series. I have never been more conscious of the fact that the story arch will not conclude here but in multiple sequels to come.<br/><br/>The pre-title sequence is incredible. The intensity of the action and the emotional impact of the scene's progression are not taken for granted, as Abrams makes great use of the music score and manipulation of sound to augment it all to full effect. Flash-forward to the rebellious youth of angry, reckless, fatherless James Tiberius Kirk. This segment is just about the only one in the whole film that loosens up within the iron grip of a domineering fan base. Once again, the music choice is interesting, the scene is loaded with action and implications of the futuristic setting, any and everyone is enjoying themselves.<br/><br/>Writers Orci and Kurtzman seem to fully understand that genre films often include clearcut plot assurances like moral certainties and action set pieces so that solving the film's conflicts can be submitted to the genre. Even parodies or criticisms of a genre rely on the audience's acquaintance with it. Thus, J.J. Abrams' Star Trek succeeds within its genre. I suppose what makes me less than partial to this film is the general ideological notions of the world of Star Trek.<br/><br/>Where Star Wars presents a story of intelligence in the universe existing a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, full of interplanetary travel on an everyday, almost casual basis, suggesting the fascinating notion of life on Earth possibly in the prehistoric era, Star Trek suggests that humanity on Earth, primarily Americans with the exception of a few token foreigners with characteristic specialties, is the ennobled savior of the universe against countless other forms of intelligence which learn more from us than we learn from them. I believe that if Romulans can emerge from the future to create black holes out of planets and Vulcans can live for hundreds of years and share thoughts, experiences, memories and knowledge through physical contact, not to mention live by the phrase ""Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations,"" which we still have yet to discover, it is not likely that they are the less evolved or efficient beings in comparison to humans.<br/><br/>Both films and their audiences are culturally operated. What a film means can and does change, but basic idealized views are taken for granted by the story. These conclusions are rooted in reiteration, which leads us to assume things unless they are outwardly countered. But that alone is not the mark of the text. It may assume particular messages and inferences, but it exists to take risks, to work through theoretical dilemmas, the purpose of the movie hero breaking new ground in relation to such things. In part due to this movie in particular being a franchise rejuvenation, they are not reproduced so much as refreshed, not so much repeated as reworked.<br/><br/>The fascination of film is reinforced by initial fascination already at work within the subject and the social establishments that molded it. Indeed, the filmmakers would've found their balls in a salad shooter if they disappointed enough fans. I believe that there is a lot about this movie's creative process that I have yet to know, hence I am sure that this film is more of a success than I realize."

","This is easily the best star trek movie yet and perhaps the most exciting and entertaining movie in the past ten years.<br/><br/>Im not a 'trekkie' but am familiar enough with the originals on TV and this was somewhat important for appreciating the comic references and for appreciating the developing cast. Unlike the new Star Wars movies, this movie was mature enough to appeal to a broad range of ages, with a quick-witted script, great one-liners, as well as deep reflection on serious issues. The antagonists are not simply 'bad', as in lessor movies, but act out of a complicated history.<br/><br/>The action is spectacular, original, and well-thought out. It is a fun ride from the beginning to the end, and even the quiet moments are filled with a forward momentum and underlying suspense. I think most people in the theater could have easily sat through another few hours. This is one that you owe it to yourself to see on the big screen... Did somebody say 'best picture'?"

Ambraams has done it again.<br/><br/>What made this film special for me was not the story (remarkably good, bearing in mind that, like the first film in any new franchise, it's backbone was character development). What made this film for me was the....photography? Can you even call CGI photography? Well, either way, this film was a visual feast. The way that scale was conveyed was breath-taking. I'm not sure whether I read this somewhere or if I can take credit for it myself, but the difference came in the way that Abrams shoved aside the traditional Star Trek view of Enterprise as a lumbering naval ship and took a more Star Wars-esquire dogfight approach. This has set a high standard for a new era of Star Trek that I hope will spawn at least a couple more films.<br/><br/>http://www.facetrust.net/cert.php?id=BZA6bXsgsIHet2wDzBg9GIRGxiJ31KS2"

","It's good when you can share something with the rest of the flock. It seems that the goods outweigh the bads in this one. Fast paced, action packed, great visuals, kind of a not-complex story in the main problem as compared to, let's say, Star Trek: Generations where they tackle time travel and lots of sci-fi goodies I love. Nevertheless, this one rocks. It's on par with the best movies I've seen in 2009, up there with Horsemen.<br/><br/>I believe movies nowadays are meant to be watched on pitch-black plasmas with Blu-Ray and a good hi-fi sound system. Cinemas, at least Puerto Rican basic projection-style 35mm cinemas, just don't cut it. I love the big screen, and a load of popcorn, Coca Colas, and the occasional sneaking of a Butterfinger or a Burger King combo into the movies, but I'm aching for a good flat screen set and some nice blu-ray action!"
"LazySod","8","1","7","22 June 2009"," To boldly attempt to please three generations
","Where does one begin to define a mission like this one? The mission being: take the combination of a long running TV-series and a series of films, loved by many and hated by just as many, and turn it into an interesting film. One can only blunder: the old guard loved the original series and hated the last series, the younger guard goes exactly the other way around. Or can one do a good job after all? I must consider myself one of the members of the old guard - I loved the original series (still do), and although I liked the second series it all went into a very steady decline after that. Filmwise it wasn't much better - the films with the original cast were all good (with one exception) and the first three films with the second cast were good too - after that it was all bad and even worse. Then came the series Enterprise and that just didn't hack it at all, worst stuff I've ever seen.<br/><br/>So when I saw the first trailers of this film I already saw Roddenberry turn around in his grave in my mind. My heart cried as they were working on the final destruction of my childhoods heroes. But I went to see the film - I wouldn't be able to deal with not having seen it, even if it was going to be bad. Nothing could have prepared me for the surprise I would be going through. As the film starts the first few moments started to proof my dread - but quickly that dread started to grow less and after about 15 minutes I felt what this film tried to do: use elements of the original series and elements of current day graphic eye candy and combine it into a stew of old and new that is at the same time completely different from all it ever was and completely the same. For me this combination was flawless - it was different enough to be a film on its own, and the same enough to allow me to reconnect to everything I once loved about the series. The explanation of things is a bit of a cliché but I'm guessing anything else would be even worse - once one tries to make a film after so many episodes of so many series and so many films one is bound to a set of events and therefore a set of limits. So, it's good. It's very good. It's a long breath of relief since parts 9 and 10 that more or less did their best to destroy the series.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 past heroes resurrected"

To this end it has succeeded.<br/><br/>It is NOT a traditional film that we were used to, and hope to see again in another form. But this is a fun flick, and I think that's the point. Have fun with it. It's a great movie designed to take you away from it all. I'm not a fan of bloody fights and short sentences but I take it in stride. Why not push the limits a bit, it's just a movie anyways. It shouldn't take away core trek beliefs and philosophies. Those are forever. And the kids today need an intro to these if they are to continue. I learned everything from Star Trek. And man I love it. It's just a different take on it, that's all. And this film is far from boring. If we knew nothing of trek, this film still rocks. And that I believe is what Abrams wanted to create. A kick ass movie.<br/><br/>Let's enjoy it for what it is.

The visual and sound effects blew me away, especially since I got to see it in a private screening the sound was through the roof.<br/><br/>The new story is smart, strong and inventive. It was the only believable way to get Leonard Nimoy in as Spock, (those of us who knew his character were really happy to see him) but what a way to do it.

But I was never a fan of the TV Shows, since never really got into them, I didn't really know much about each character's back story.

The right actors were picked for the characters, although some may not look like who they are supposed to be, you can't imagine any other actors playing the roles, they are not caricatures of the characters they are playing, they add something new and yet something familiar at the same time.<br/><br/>I will admit I didn't like some of the changes that happened in the time line that differed from the original plot line in Star Trek, plus I wasn't really sure about the romance between Spock and Uhura but I don't think the film should be condemned for that and who knows what will happen, they could do another film and it could go back to the way it was or go a different path, as long as it carries on Star Trek's spirit, I'm sure it will do alright.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film especially seeing the character development of Spock and Kirk as individuals but also as a partnership beginning and it was brilliant to see Leonard Nimoy in the film and I really hope there will be more films that follow on from this one because it would be such a shame if this to be the only modern take take on Star Trek.<br/><br/>Well done everyone on Star Trek, brilliant film, enjoyed it more than I thought I would."

Many elements are above-average: the production design, the sets, the special effects, the musical score, the direction, the new fleet uniforms, most of the writing, and the casting. Well, almost all of the casting choices. There is the one exception that ruins it for me. I'm certain the actor is very talented and disciplined at his craft. It's just that every time the actor playing Leonard 'Bones' McCoy comes on screen the film takes a left turn as if his scenes are skits from Saturday Night Live. His performance of McCoy is a parody at best and if it's meant to honor DeForest Kelley well it misfired."

I really liked the spatula on the holo-deck circuit in DS9 and Data's cat in Star Dreck: The next regurgitation, but those were few and far between. The new Star Trek movie does not take itself seriously. It avoids self-parody because it has an internal logic that this pile of children are not normal. Not a single one of them. They are the misfits of the Academy. Stuck on a normal ship, they would be bored or court-martialed. With Captain Jerk as their boss, they have room to breath and all of space to goof off in. It is a winner because it is not afraid to lose a few points in the seriousness category. ""Star Wars: The beginning of the agony"" had all those wonderful toys and a buncha characters who looked like they just got them for Christmas and couldn't read the manual. Each episode in the canon became more and more dire in it's seriousness, with even Yoda finally looking like he really needed a bong hit. The Mattress movies with Keanu whats-his-face had a deadly morose quality to them that made you want to view any landline phones with suspicion and guys with suits and sunglasses with fear, as well as your own computer with paranoia. ""Star Trek"" treats ""future"" technology as just one more gag. Even when Spork mark 2 has to fly Spork Prime's fancy gyro-ship, it is with a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face, not to mention a cock of the eyebrow as he utters,""Fascinating!""<br/><br/>""Galaxy Quest"" took the mickey out of all that bombast and circumstance, including the fanboy mania. ""Fifth Element"" made space fun again and a fast-paced, multi-location narrative something to enjoy. ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" set up a series of gags and knocked them down like dominoes, including it's own iconic usefulness. ""Star Trek"" deals with death, sex, birth, planetary destruction and personality conflicts as just part of life, instead of making an Ibsen play out of them. Shakespeare would love the way dire consequences that would cause normal people to fall back on tradition and training instead inspire this group of geniuses to improvise and hang the consequences. <br/><br/>This ""Star Trek"" hasn't seen the limits of its stars or its scriptwriters. They are nascent, ripe for further silliness. I hope the next film is called ""Star Trek: You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet""."

You are watching Kirk do his job, Spock do his job. Picard doing his job. It is about chores and was invariably a diversion or a chore to watch.<br/><br/>'Star Wars' is myth, fantasy - Perseus with lazer swords, King ARthur with hovering landspeeders and weird creatures. <br/><br/>This is why J.J.

He has attempted to place the Arthur story, the Hero's Journey, onto Kirk and the Enterprise, revisionist storytelling that should be as offensive to 'Star Trek' fans as it is to 'Star Wars' fans.<br/><br/>The new film is damned exciting in places, but Eric Bana's brooding rogue Romulan could have been lifted from 'Star Trek: Nemesis'. Spock was never as petulant as Skywalker, Kirk was never as cool as Han - so the new producers and directors have cheated and grafted those personas onto them. Uhura is Leia, Old Spock is Yoda/Ben Kenobi and the chop-n-shoot style of seventies' Lucas is imported. Even the scramble for the shuttles is straight out of 'Jedi'.<br/><br/>You can't cheat - 'Star Trek' fans, you all know Trek is not and should not be as engaging as this - Abrams has ripped up your classic characters and started again so he can make this appeal - which should also offend. 'Star Wars' fans, by turns, should accept not this pretender to the throne.

","the movie was really cool and entertaining, i loved the graphics and the dialogue was pretty good for a star trek movie. i enjoyed myself.<br/><br/>that being said, there were several issues i had with the movie. kirk's character remained static and he didn't really show his honorable and true side, only his cocky and hilarious one. spock saved the day, not him; i have no idea why he was awarded with the title of captain (i guess everyone was like ""well he made a good captain in that alternate universe, so hell definitely make a good one in this one!""). there were also several unnecessary action scenes like when sulu pulls out that stupid sword to ""fence"" the romulan guard and when kirk is being chased by the random ice monsters on Hoth...i mean that random M-class planet.<br/><br/>this is more of a thought than criticism, but wouldn't it be more federation-like to beam the romulans aboard the enterprise whether the captain wanted to or not? lol picard would have done that! oh well.<br/><br/>and, btw, are we really SURE that the vulcans Didn't cause the star to supernova? it didn't even turn into a red giant or anything first...ud think the romulans would realize their star's lifespan was coming to an end, especially since theyd have a few thousand years to prepare once it started to expand..."

","While I grew up watching Star Trek reruns and movies, I have not watched anything to do with Star Trek in a decade. My ten year old son has never seen Star Trek and had no desire to see this movie. I took him anyway. Now he wants to rent all of the previous films.<br/><br/>This film does a fantastic job of telling an origins story that is much different than most people probably guessed it would be, yet at the same time remains true to the original mythology. Somehow the movie maintains a perfect balance of familiarity and unpredictability. Combine that with updated visual effects and intense action sequences, and this movie becomes a highly entertaining character study that deserves repeat viewings.<br/><br/>Only one thing really irritated me about this movie. The plot is so complicated that the movie makers felt it necessary to explain in narrative during a Vulcan mind meld halfway through the film. I felt like I was being treated like a kid since the movie did not trust my intelligence enough to supply enough information for me to fill in the blanks. Instead, the filmmakers resort to explicitly telling me exactly what is going on. I resented those few moments.<br/><br/>Still, the movie was much better than I expected it to be."
"rich_mac00","8","1","7","16 May 2009"," Not Star Trek
","After seeing this new reincarnation of the franchise I came out of the cinema feeling exhilarated by what I had just witnessed. This is what Star Trek should have done AGES ago. I'm sorry but the last two films were absolute toilet, in particular 'Nemesis'. A lot of Trekkies on here are moaning and beguiling J.Abrams about the focus and composition of this film, without really understanding his intentions. Don't get me wrong, I'm not new to the franchise and I've seen pretty much all of TOS, DS9 and Enterprise. I'm not a fan of NG or Voyager so I gave those a wide berth. How was he supposed to make the film consistent with previous series? Use NG characters? No because NG sucked. Voyager? No because the acting in that sucked too. DS9? No because how could he explain the characters from DS9 all joining up on Starship? Enterprise? No because it never gained enough fans. Finally TOS? No because the combined age of that crew would exceed the combined age of a packed cinema.<br/><br/>I believe that he followed the only logical conclusion which was too effectively, slightly 'dumb down' TOS characters to make it more accessible to audiences. Hollywood is all about making money, something which Nemesis failed to do, and this film is the perfect tonic. It's fast paced with strong character development, the plot is simple if a little contrived but it doesn't matter in what is, in essence, an action movie. The dialogue is strong for a film of this type. Abrams style of shooting works well too, he has an ability to create tension/excitement through clever use of lighting and angles. Eric Bana, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto all deliver great performances. The other characters are overshadowed but it's only a two hour long film, you know? As always the special FX are spectacular.<br/><br/>In addition I love how engineering actually looked believable. Before if something got broken on starship, Scotty or Geordy 'Stereotype' La Forge would scan pieces of glass for a couple of hours and it would be fixed but know you can see engineers actually replacing parts, wiring etc because it's all exposed.<br/><br/>It is not a 'classic Star Trek movie' (Thank God) but a summer blockbuster with amazing action sequences. It also reveals to us what Spock and Kirk were like when they were younger, which is intriguing. Why do Trekkies believe that Star Trek is theirs? It's not and this film is the kick up the backside that the franchise has needed ever since TOS. Of course it would have been nice to have the characters from TOS in the time of special FX but we don't live in a perfect world and Star Trek is not a perfect film..... but it's bloody good."

","This film is amazing. I do not really have any thing else to add over what other people have said. Except, I am not a Trekky, I am not a sci- fi nerd (OK well maybe a bit), I just like a good film, and this is an amazing one. <br/><br/>It is probably the only sci-fi film ever made that rivals the original Star Wars in scope, action, and story line. This film is everything the last three Star Wars films wanted to be and failed at becoming. <br/><br/>If you like Star Wars and have never really been bothered about Star Trek watch this. It is amazing. I fear the only people that are slating this film are old school Star Trek nerds who can not get with the present. The use of CGI in this film is breathtaking and beautiful. Yes, beautiful. I am a big fan of good cinematography and who ever did this film should get an Oscar. <br/><br/>Everything about this film is good. The storyline, the ideas, the graphics, the scenery, the pace, the acting, and the humour, of which there are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. Having always been a fan of William Shatner's hilarious Captain Kirk character I was weary of how anyone could live up to him, but the actor Chris Pine does a commendable job at portraying the young Kirk. Not to mention Zachary Quinto's Spook who is excellent.<br/><br/>I'm going back to watch this film again while it's still doing the rounds. Only this time to the IMAX"
"Jason-Boulton","8","1","7","15 May 2009"," And I was soooo worried!
","I really didn't know what to make of JJ' latest idea. Reboot the franchise. Same characters but different actors? I mean come on. These guys are iconic. Shatner, Nimoy, Kelly - how on earth can you get new actors playing these roles without it turning into a parody.<br/><br/>Weve......BEAMed down to the PLANet.<br/><br/>My god Im a Doctor not a Miracle worker...<br/><br/>I canny break the laws of physics Captain! But here is the big news. Save for a couple of small flaws - more of that later - by and large he has done it. He really has. I actually left the cinema smiling having enjoyed a wonderful couple of hours where I was genuinely excited and enthralled and amused.<br/><br/>Im a huge Trekkie fan....Wrath of Khan being mine and a lot of peoples favourite. Rest assured things are now only going to get better.<br/><br/>The wonderful thing about the film was that the new actors playing the iconic characters didn't mimic the old actors. I have to give special mention to Chris Pine who in my mind (along with McCoy) had a really difficult line to tread with Kirk. Good news is - He nailed it. He didn't pretend to be Shatner but just every so often I smiled because he did something that was so very Shatner! The little slap on the shoulder of McCoy near the end along with a line like (only seen it once) Buckle up!.<br/><br/>Also the way he sat in the captains chair.<br/><br/>The cockiness over the test he reconfigured to beat. Perfect - wonderful really.<br/><br/>Next up = Special Effects...<br/><br/>One word - AWESOME. Did anybody else give a little yelp during the Kelvin battle at the start. How good was the action handled and the exterior shots of the battle.<br/><br/>The Space jump. I was worried about that on the trailer. WOW - fantastic and the fight. Goodbye Red Shirt!! lol.<br/><br/>Even Captain Pike. Perfect.<br/><br/>Im going to mention a couple of things that annoyed me now. Really small points but just notched it below perfect for me.<br/><br/>Old Spock. I don't know why but he just felt out of place here. Sort of Jammed in to prove this is Star Trek.<br/><br/>Contrieved meetings.... How they met Scotty. Hmmmm. Sort of a bit forced - We need to get Scotty in somehow??? Why not just have him as the engineer on the Enterprise or Number 2 and the Chief gets killed. Wouldn't have been so forced and would have made more sense. I just hate awkward forced things like that when they are unnecessary.<br/><br/>Finally - Spock/Kirk aged about 9. Totally unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Apart from a bit that looked like it was there just for the Trailer. Im James Tiberius Kirk!!! Ow - awful. (Not so bad the Spock bit).<br/><br/>8/10. Roll on the next one!!!"

","I loved the characters in star trek - I am one of the 60's original star trek fans who thought the stories stunk till the movies came out but I always loved the characters. This remake is a little too much star wars like as has been sited in the other reviews, and I have never been a star wars fan - never engaged in the characters or storyline. I also found the music annoying at times, pulling me me out of the scene and back into a theater where I was irritated by the music. But I loved the actors portrayals of beloved characters. Since there can be no more star treks with the old crew as we are all old, I would love to see some new ones with a new crew who keeps alive the original characters. Since I cannot return to a simpler time, I do appreciate what has been offered as homage to Gene Roddenberry and the actors who came back from a justifiable cut from television (really BAD scripts and stories) to create one of the most beloved series of movies in my lifetime."

","Being a fan of the original series and of The Next Generation TV series I expected to hate this, was it a remake which would ruin a good series or could it actually be worth watching? Well I'm pleased to say I really enjoyed this film, non star trek fans can jump in and enjoy it as a stand alone movie and fans of the series can enjoy a look at how the original crew start out.<br/><br/>So there's a few plot holes, nothing too major or noticeable but as with many big Hollywood blockbusters nowadays you do need to suspend belief a little.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty straightforward and nothing too original, future bad guy time travels to past and basically sets out to destroy everything and the crew of a lone star ship must defeat his evil plan.<br/><br/>But don't let that put you off, the acting is good (young Kirk, Spock and McCoy are perfectly cast and acted), the special effects are just amazing and there is a shed load of kick ass action.<br/><br/>As a fan of the series I enjoyed seeing the characters growing up and their personalities being examined, and yes Spock does say ""fascinating"" in the film, that annoyingly Vulcan attitude of his fully evident throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes that stood out, the introduction of Kirks father during a heated battle, Spocks father finally telling him the real reason he married a human, the scene where Spock loses his temper on the Enterprise and Kirk trying to run through the Enterprise with swollen hands risking his life to warn of a Romulan attack All in all a good fun action sci-fi adventure for Trekkies and non Trekkies alike"

","Spock snogs (aka kisses passionately) Uhura means we couldn't have an unemotional Spock in the 21st century. It's the pointed ears they go for. This Spock probably watches soap operas and gets weepy during the toilet paper commercial with the little puppy in it. Kirk also has to be different. He's not a serious Starship captain. He's a troubled teenage tearaway who just pops into the Academy for 3 years and then sneaks onto the Enterprise.<br/><br/>The original Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) once said to Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry about the original TV series ""You're making morality plays "" and he said ""Ssh, they haven't figured it out"". Well no danger of that here. It's fun, not serious.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away the Romulans go back in time for revenge, cheap beer and more tattoos. The characterizations are quite good and some good comic moments come out of that.<br/><br/>It's good fun and I'm sure there'll be more of this new Star Trek. The only question is how far this Spock/Uhura thing will go. Perhaps we'll see ""Star Trek 2 – The Wrath of that time of the month"" and then maybe ""Star Trek 3 – The search for the G-Spot """

The recent series have just run Star Trek into an ever narrower bottle neck of what Trek can or cant be and this has snatched it back from that rut and put it back in the mainstream, where popular culture is supposed to be.<br/><br/>A couple of things about it did go CLUNK, primarily Spock and Uhura, but i shook that off, if its going to live on, Star Trek needed a big slap across the chops and this was it.

"james-965","7","1","7","14 May 2009"," Decent film, amazing potential.
","In short: slightly disappointed. Good film, with much potential providing they ditch the awful hacks (Orci/Kurtzman) who wrote the script.<br/><br/>In detail:<br/><br/>Here starts a nerdy deconstruction. Bear with me :)<br/><br/>I'm a long standing Trek fan but not a Trekkie/Trekker (I'd never visit a convention). TNG/DS9 was the peak of ST in my mind. The original films I held in high regard (until the last two). I also thought TOS were decent too, Voyager/ENT were bad, however. My boss, who was a big fan, convinced me the new film was amazing. So last night I went with my bro, and a mate.<br/><br/>What's good:<br/><br/>1. Good introductions to all the characters. 2. Decent villain - Chopper aka Bana 3. Fast-ish pacing, but not up to The Dark Knight's level. 4. Good jokes. Much more than an average ST film. 5. Above average fight sequences. 6. The potential to go somewhere with future sequels, this only scraped the surface.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>1. Spock, both old and new were great, nay, amazing. Quinto and Nimoy stole the show. 2. Scotty aka Pegg. Stood out like a saw thumb, but nailed all his lines. Perfect new Scotty. Spaced in Star Trek, who'da though it? 3. Sulu and Uhura were both good, and hot - in that order. 4. Pike (Greenwood) was a good Captain. Hope he turns up again in the sequels. 5. McCoy. Urban ripped off Kelly's performance to an adequate level. Amusing, but not amazing.<br/><br/>and then..<br/><br/>6. Kirk. Ugh. I couldn't suspend disbelief that Pine was Kirk. Yeah he fought, acted with bravado and arrogance, was courageous. But against Older Spock, the quality of acting between the two was discernible. Nowhere near as good as Quinto. 7. Chekov. Yelchin was a comedic foil with his V's pronounced as W's. Oh, ho ho ho, how I did not laugh. Cheap jokes. For some reason he was as good as Scotty using the transporter, why? 8. Spock's mother. Ryder? Seriously, what the? She's only nine years old than Quinto, and it showed - the make up alone was not enough.<br/><br/>What's no-so-good:<br/><br/>1. Plot holes you can fly a ship through. Due to the pacing, this isn't such a big issue. But you know the script writers behind Transformers were writing it, because the ""logic"" was loose, in the loosest sense (and as a computer programmer this bugs me, more than the dirge from a bad Voyager EP).<br/><br/>2. It felt like Star Trek: The Younger Years. Everyone was far too fresh faced. People were promoted far to quickly and without good reason. The were playing off the previous films/alternative universe theory to get around this, but it didn't make sense.<br/><br/>3. Didn't leave me feeling awestruck. Definitely should not be in the IMDb top 100, where it currently resides.<br/><br/>4. Shaky cam/lense flare. Ditch them, the normal rig mounted cam shots were a cut above the hand-held sequences.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Abrams could really make something with the sequels, but a new script writer who can balance the action with logic and reason would be essential. Orci/Kurtzman who I keep mentioning are only good at writing Sunday matinée scripts, with cute dialog and cheap jokes. They need to be kicked to the kirb ASAP. They wont, because the sales figures from this and Transformers will keep their sorry arses in a job. <br/><br/>All in all, a decent film. Not amazing, but with much potential."
"liam_a_monk","8","1","7","12 May 2009"," Pretty Impressed
","Simply put, I always hated Star Trek, it was for nerds (just an opinion, no need to send me greasy hate mail!); however this film was thoroughly entertaining and well worth a watch, so I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good action flick. No more needs to be said than that. <br/><br/>As for the debate over how this compares to the original movies - well I couldn't care less. Does it matter that the wafer-thin, time-travel plot seems tacked on just to appease the hardcore following? Possibly - but only if you go to watch a film solely to criticise, and not for escapism. <br/><br/>It's good enough to stand alone on its own merit, and that other debate is for Star Trek conventions, which I thankfully won't be attending. Live long, and...whatever, just go and see it."
"randawg72","9","1","7","11 May 2009"," Different but good. ...
","I just saw this movie in IMAX an I liked it. I'm a longtime ST fan and have been patiently waiting for this release since I saw the teaser trailer over a year ago. <br/><br/>Since most remakes of classic shows typically suck (Lost in Space, My Favorite Martian, Get Smart to name a short list). I didn't expect much when I went into the theater. It's been said already, but don't go in expecting it to be like the original series because it definitely is Not. The plot is interesting while following the conventions and technology from the previous ST series and movies. <br/><br/>This movie has several twists and surprises that I would never have guessed. It's enjoyable to the original ST fans, as well as young people who have never even seen the original series. The small differences old time fans will notice are explained in the new chain of events that unfold in this story. The actors portray the crew true to their character's personalities without copying the original casts interpretations. Good performances all around, especially by Karl Urban (Dr McCoy), and Zachary Quinto (Spock). I thought Chris Pine was good, but for me lacked some of the swagger and restrained arrogance of William Shatner's original Captain Kirk. I also liked Simon Pegg as Scotty, and John Cho as Sulu. <br/><br/>In summary, I think it's an enjoyable film that I plan to see again. It sets the stage for the second movie that I hope will allow the new cast to further develop the characters we already know so well. <br/><br/>~Randawg."

Before i saw this movie i didn't even know who kirk was, i have seen pictures of Spock so i had a idea that he was an alien. But this movie was so good. At first i thought George kirk was the main character then i got it after a while. This movie got me into star trek , as soon as i got home i watch the old TV show, amazing. This was the best star trek out of all of them then goes the 6th one. I even went back and saw this 3 times my bro saw it 7 times. This movie is amazing and everyone should watch it.

","I was at the cinema with my friends both male and female waiting to see the terminator film until we realised that it was yet to be released (lucky really). We then moved our attention to star trek. Not one of us being over the age of 25 we where extremely hesitant at first with not a single one of us giving the film any credit. This however soon changed to utter astonishment.<br/><br/>I really believe I will not see a better film this year... if anything it has out done any expectation from any critic.<br/><br/>A great mix of CGI, Action, comedy and a plot that was designed for all purposes. I laughed until I cried and was truly gripped by the story the whole way through.<br/><br/>The best bit about the new film is that if you are a die hard star trek fan you will enjoy how they have been loyal to the previous characters and if you only recently discovered star trek is based in space (like me) you will enjoy the fresh humour and storyline.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg you little diamond! Although I enjoyed the portrayal of all characters in the film I feel that Simon Pegg really lived up to the role of scotty. utterly hilarious.<br/><br/>I don't know much about the details or any of the fancy vocab to link the film with the previous series. But I do not take time out of my day to write reviews unless I feel in debt to the creator and this film will entertain you. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.<br/><br/>I plead with the production crew to not look at the box office takings and go all transformers 2 with it though... I hope they will realise that this is a gem and It has the capability to be ruined by overly enthusiastic spielbergs. If this film sticks to its roots it will have a great sequel and I'm am anxiously awaiting the day the next star trek is announced.<br/><br/>Thank you to the media for this truly entertaining recreation of a masterpiece."
"Phuqz","9","1","8","7 July 2009"," What had to be done
","You know, when I was a kid, Star Trek took me away from myself for 30 minutes each week. Even now, nearly 40 years later when I know its not a space ship I'm still able to suspend belief and enjoy it for what it was. That was Gene's magic, not lore, or scientific (something that is way more NG than ToS) mumbo jumbo, but his ability to make us believe that a group of bad actors with crap props was actually a real star ship with real people discovering new civilisations.<br/><br/>This movie does exactly the same, it changes and challenges established things, asks you to suspend belief, sometimes a lot but if you can, then like ToS it has all the magic and energy with better effects, production and way better acting. Put simply it took me away like ToS used to, something that only Wrath has managed since. I've watched it twice now and every time I don't want it to end. With the exception of Scotty (whom I found irritating) the cast was impeccable and did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Yes, it has plot holes, yes it breaks some lore, but A) it's a film not a text book and B) Roddenbery wanted to take us away from ourselves. He didn't care about accepted lore, that is why he had a black woman on the bridge when you didn't have either a black person or a woman in such a role in the 60s. For fans to become so encumbered by the status quo or the rule book is practically anti-Gene.<br/><br/>TOS was nothing more than a vehicle for Gene to express his political views, but ultimately outside of those it was simply a camp romp in space. Shatner isn't a good actor, he has 4 facial movements for Christ sake, want proof see Whom The Gods Destroy. So I find it odd when they and the series outside of its concepts are immortalised in such a way that bears no resemblance to the reality. Also, whilst it had some of its roots in science, transportation via beaming in 1969 was no more believable or scientific then, than red matter is today.<br/><br/>Despite its poor production, poor acting and often horrifically bad scripts I loved ToS and I still do. Likewise, despite this films holes, slips and issues it is lovable in the extreme.<br/><br/>I think it is time for all of us fans to be honest, Star Trek had nowhere left to boldly go, this movie or something similar was its only option. Gene always tore up the established order of things, JJ has done the same.<br/><br/>If it's not your cup of T, then I totally understand, but remember that Star Trek was ground breaking (in its day) not for its lore but for its ability to rewrite the rule book. <br/><br/>Being down on this film because it does what Gene did so well seems ironic and reminds me of those people who were morally outraged when Uhura kissed Kirk.<br/><br/>Despite all this movies faults and yes it has them, it gives something that Star-Trek hasn't for a long time, a great movie."
"stryker1121","Null","1","8","6 July 2009"," JJ (almost) does it again
","Full disclosure: I am not a Trekkie.<br/><br/>I don't remember much from the original series besides campiness and hammy acting. I have fleeting memories of blue-skinned alien girls in beehive hairdos and spangled eye-shadow; spaceship interiors that looked like Hugh Hefner's den (velour furniture, purple wall sconces); Spock mind-melding with a paper-maché creature that resembled a moldy pizza (that was a weird episode); and red-shirted ensigns being gruffly pronounced ""dead, Jim"" by Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy.<br/><br/>The classic show led to numerous spin-offs, and while I have my nerdish leanings, I'm not a fan of ""hard sci-fi,"" a term that sounds pornographic, but unfortunately is not. All it means is the writers of ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""The Next Generation"" got the theoretical science right when it came to explaining the intricacies of warp drives and particle accelerators. I went to summer school for high-school algebra for Spock's sake, so crazy moon-man talk about quantum physics fried my non-math-understanding synapses.<br/><br/>All I wanted out of J.J. Abrams's ""Star Trek"" reboot was an intelligent, character-driven sci-fi/ action movie, a scarce multiplex commodity in these dark days of Bay, Ratner and Emmerich.<br/><br/>Abrams did not have to march lockstep with the franchise's much obsessed over canon to make me happy, and truly, the red-hot ""Lost"" creator does his damndest to make the movie his own while (hopefully) keeping even the crotchetiest Trekkie pleased. The result is an ambitious, well-cast, but ultimately imperfect sci-fi experience.<br/><br/>The story smartly twists the origins of the famous USS Enterprise crew. Abrams contrives an alternate ""Trek"" universe that uses the series' beginnings as a kind of pushing off point. The result is an all-new film cosmos that recognizes the origin story while remaining free of that story's sticky narrative constraints.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Abrams makes his solid if clichéd time travel/revenge plot less important than the re-introduction of the Enterprise crew. Abrams knows how familiar fans are with these mainstays, and ensures most everyone hits their stock catchphrases and shopworn character moments. Chekhov mis-pronouncing ""V"" words with ""W?"" It's in there. McCoy grouchily insisting he's a doctor, not a physicist, dammit? That's there, too. Young Kirk hooks up with a blue alien babe, and there's even a ""red-shirt moment"" (Ah, Chief Engineer Olson, we hardly knew ye) for particularly nostalgic fans.<br/><br/>I understand the necessity of offering such filmic signposts to help re-launch a foundering franchise. However, this new ""Star Trek"" has almost too much of a prologue feel.<br/><br/>A game cast of virtual unknowns elevates the proceedings, and gives me hope for the inevitable sequel. Chris Pine gets Capt. Kirk's brash arrogance just right without having to do a William Shatner impression, while Zachary Quinto's Spock is all simmering emotion under that placid Vulcan exterior. Karl Urban's McCoy channels a bit too much from DeForest Kelley's original-series performance, but it's still a dead-on imitation. The only cast member who suffers is Eric Bana, whose villainous Romulan ship captain doesn't get enough screen time to be a daunting presence.<br/><br/>My tiresome hair-splitting aside, I recognize that ""Star Trek"" is in talented hands. From his work on ""Lost,"" ""Alias"" and the fun monster flick ""Cloverfield,"" Abrams has shown he knows how to craft a smart, action-packed product. A meatier plot for the sequel will ensure his new franchise both lives long and prospers.<br/><br/>(For more film reviews, visit clevelandsportstorture.blogspot.com)"
"ozymandiaskingofkings","9","1","8","1 July 2009"," Star Trek is back. And it's awesome!
","Saw this ages ago, sorry it's taken me so long to get a review up, but I've been doing my final exams (yay, I'm a graduand!). Anyway, I really enjoyed this film, it may lack the brains of traditional Trek, but it remained extremely entertaining nevertheless. I should point out foremost that while I am a fan of Sci-Fi, and of the original Star Trek, I'm not really a Trekkie, and have very little interest in The Next Generation. I got into the Original Series very recently. It was on late night BBC 2 last year and I got into watching it while pulling all night essay stints. I found it entertaining, liked the plots and the characters and found it vastly preferable to what I've seen of the bloated, moralistic and, frankly, boring subsequent series. I am not however, a purist (I am not an anorak on it as I am on classic ""Doctor Who"" for example) so can only comment in the loosest terms in regards to how a fan would receive it. If I had to guess though, I'd say that, a few quibbles aside, the fan should love this as much as a newcomer.<br/><br/>That really is the strength of this film. JJ Abrams somehow manages to strike a perfect balance between catering for the fans, and catering for blockbuster audiences who just want to see massive spaceships blowing stuff up. And he delivers with a vengeance, creating what is both an adrenaline fuelled action adventure and also a geeky nostalgia trip for those of us who have seen the classic series.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple prequel fare, following Jim Kirk from no good punk, through the Federation academy, to ensign under Christopher Pike and finally, the man thrust into command of the enterprise against the threat of a deranged Romulan's insidious plans to destroy the Federation. However, Abrams knows exactly what he is doing and, unlike the tepid ""Wolverine"", really fleshes out well known characters, rather than just delivering more of the same. He also cleverly adds a dimension of time-travel to the plot, meaning that on the sequels he can do whatever he likes without pissing off continuity nerds, its smart and somehow, doesn't feel like a cheat.<br/><br/>By far the most impressive aspect of the film is the cast. The acting talent on display here is terrific, balancing the difficult task of capturing the soul of the well known characters and fleshing them out, without falling into the trap of merely impersonating the original actors. They succeed admirably: Chris Pine captures Kirk's cockiness and Zachary Quinto is great as the hotheaded younger Spock, but the most plaudits must go to Karl Urban as Bones, who is so good, you'd swear they cloned DeForrest Kelly. The supporting cast is also very effective, with Bruce Greenwood's Captain Pike the standout, adding earthy notes and depth to a character previously relegated to a horrible accident on the TV show.<br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning, taking a leaf out of Star Wars book and hosting massive chaotic space battles, yet remaining much darker in tone. We are actually worried about these characters and care about them winning, especially after the unhinged Nero .... ah, well that would be telling.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is fast paced, witty and exciting, and I can honestly say it's one of the few films I've seen where everyone, male or female, old or young, walked out with a huge grin on their face. Take your friends or your family and you'll have an awesome time."

","Well well well. I see it didn't take long for the Bat'leth's to come out for this! This is Sci Fi my friends with the emphasis on fiction.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams has taken the franchise and giving it a total shot in the arm. Nero's appearance has changed everything only if you subscribe to the linear time flow view. Now you can have the original Trek and these bright new things and a new future.<br/><br/>These are early Federation ships, not the space hotels of NextGen or Voyager. You rarely saw the Engine room in the Original TV series but when you did it was portrayed as cavernous and industrial. Not an office with a big glowing tube of anti-matter as in NextGen. Check out Star Trek 1 (with Vger if you recall) for a similar view of Engineering.<br/><br/>This is a great film, Trekkies and non-Trekkies should embrace this film. Great performances by the entire cast, you are left in now doubt that these are the original crew members but the actors still put enough of a spin on the characters to make them ""new"".<br/><br/>Don't listen to the Trekkie whinges it's an entertaining romp and I for one am looking forward to many sequels."
"TrekFan1","9","1","8","23 June 2009"," An amazing adventure, despite a somewhat muddled plot
",":::The following review was originally written on May 7th, 2009. It has been modified to fit IMDb guidelines.:::<br/><br/>I spent three years looking forward to this movie. From the moment it was first announced in April 2006 up through today, my anticipation for this movie has steadily increased. Tonight, I finally got to see if the waiting and anticipating was worth it. And holy crap, was it ever.<br/><br/>In simple terms, Star Trek is awesome! I have been a Trek fan for many years and have seen every movie and every episode of every TV show and none of them thrilled me as much as this one. This is one of the best Treks ever, and it's one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Director J.J. Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have outdone themselves by doing what many believed was impossible. They have not only revitalized the Trek franchise by making a great sci-fi/action saga that appeals to a wider audience, they have done so while capturing the spirit of the original Trek series.<br/><br/>The extent to which the writers alter Trek history might be met with anger by some, but the story is so fun and the characters so lovingly written, I did not see it as a huge issue. In fact, I think it was a smart move: if the movie was set in the old timeline, there would be little suspense or surprise because we already know what happens to the characters. As controversial as it may be, the writers handled it beautifully and without a hint of disrespect.<br/><br/>The recasting of the other iconic characters from the original Trek is perfect, and the performances are top notch. There was as much care in casting as there was in writing the movie. All of the actors do wonderful jobs with their characters, with the standouts being Simon Pegg's Scotty and Karl Urban's McCoy. The supporting cast does great work, as well, particularly Bruce Greenwood, who owns the role of Captain Pike, and Ben Cross, who is a perfect Sarek. Most notably, however, it was great to see Leonard Nimoy return to the role of Spock. Mr. Nimoy did a beautiful job (as always); it was as though he had never stopped playing the role.<br/><br/>The visual effects are possibly the best I have ever seen in any film, certainly in any Trek film. ILM and FX Supervisor Roger Guyett have surpassed all of their prior work. The visuals were nothing short of awe-inspiring, yet, at the same time, they didn't completely rule the movie. Make no mistake, the stars of this movie are the characters, not the effects.<br/><br/>The story unfolds at a nearly break-neck pace. It holds your attention throughout the entire movie, and leaves you wanting more when it's over. It was thrilling, emotional, funny... everything a movie should be, especially a Trek movie. <br/><br/>My only real issue with the movie was the somewhat muddled plot. The story moves along so fast, certain plot elements are lost in the rush, and some lack explanation either because certain lines or scenes were cut or because the writers chose not to elaborate. For example, Nero's motive for destroying Federation planets is pretty weak because the writers chose not to more fully describe his origins. There were a few other very minor things about the movie that didn't work for me, didn't make sense, or at the very least could have used a bit more explanation. How did Starfleet make the connection between the ""lightning storm in space"" in the neutral zone and the seismic activity on Vulcan, anyway? Why would Nero have to drill a hole into Vulcan when he could just drop red matter onto the planet and detonate it with a torpedo or something? You know, little things like that.<br/><br/>Another disappointment is the lack of screen time given to Winona Ryder, Jennifer Morrison, Clifton Collins, Jr., and especially Eric Bana. All did good work in their roles, I just wish we could have seen more of them. I was also disappointed (though not surprised) that scenes featuring young James Kirk and his brother were deleted from the movie. The boy Jim Kirk drives by was actually supposed to be his brother, but the character's other scene was cut and the movie was re-dubbed so that Kirk's brother became an unrelated boy named ""Johnny"", making the entire exchange pointless. I'm also still a bit disgruntled that a scene at the Klingon prison camp was deleted, but its omission didn't hurt the final product.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect, but it is nonetheless successful both as a mainstream sci-fi adventure and as a Star Trek movie. It's fun, it's exciting, it's funny... seriously, I have trouble believing anyone could not like this movie, including die-hard Trekkies like myself. The characters may be played by different actors and they may be part of a different timeline, but make no mistake, these are very much the same iconic characters seen in the original Star Trek. And they are clearly handled with all the care and respect that is humanly possible.<br/><br/>Star Trek is full of almost non-stop action, but it also has a lot of humor and a lot of heart. Not everything worked, but what did worked brilliantly. I commend Abrams, Orci, Kurtzman, and everyone else who helped make this Trek a truly glorious enterprise. Like The Dark Knight before it, Star Trek lives up to the hype, and it was most definitely worth the three years of waiting and anticipation.<br/><br/>The human adventure is just beginning!"
"pc95","7","1","8","19 June 2009"," Good Effort with a few problems
","After some high praise from co-workers, finally got around to watching this new Star Trek saga getting launched. And I liked it although I wasn't head-over-heals for it. I see some similarities in the changes akin to the way the James Bond series was changed. There's a lot of sleek new looks and some fairly good acting, but in giving up or moving on from some the older formulas or patterns in it's series, it loses some things. I thought the story was pretty interesting although not original. The direction seemed pretty good as were the effects. I thought Zachary Quinto nailed it as young Spock and Karl Urban did a good job as young Bones. By far the best-done scene was the jump scene with the drill - extremely captivating and as much or more so than any Star Trek scene in any Star Trek movie. Some of the problems though were Eric Bana as a bland Romulan Nero. I don't know all the story and past details but the Romulans didn't look very interesting. Chris Pine as Kirk was just - OK. The creators in general tweaked characters that they should've stuck hard and fast to, and the acting either needs to completely clean slate the old casts mannerisms/ways of speaking or really make a strong effort to try to incorporate/mimic them. Instead we have some actors sometimes sounding like original actors and sometimes not - inconsistency. Some of the character tweaks were in poor taste too such as Uhura and the whole romance angle. And the having a Beastie Boys soundtrack in the beginning is trashy and UTTERLY misplaced. Maybe if you're a trekky of the original Star Trek's cerebral story lines and science-fiction you might be disappointed, but I was receptive and ready for the changes and ready to take most of the changes at face-value. I would agree the movie loses some of it's thoughtful pensive nature of the original series which actually does seem to detract, but still recommended to see in the theater for the action-oriented."

","The USS Kelvin is flying through space only to discover an uncharted anomaly. When a gigantic ship appears and attacks the Kelvin it looks curtains for the crew. However under the stewardship of temporary Captain George Kirk, most of the crew aboard are saved, including his wife and new-born son. Years of struggling to come to terms with his father's loss sees James T Kirk rebellious, distrustful and lost, until father figure Captain Christopher Pike dares him to enlist in star fleet and better his father's heroic achievement. Here he meets his best friends Bones McCoy and a young upstart Vulcan called Spock whose officiousness and efficiency are in stark contrast to Kirk's wild abandoned approach to life and to rules.<br/><br/>Thus begins the re-imagining of the Star Trek film series (I hate calling them a franchise...It's not McDonalds!) by J J Abrams. Being the creator of lost one might imagine this would be a convoluted mess of a film, however what comes across in this film is clearly J J's passion for the history and tradition of what the original material was about which has lead to a lot that is praiseworthy about it and just a little that isn't.<br/><br/>First I'm gonna get the negative out of the way. The film does feel a bit familiar. The big ship at the beginning and the music used is very ""Star Trek: the motion picture"", the Kobyoshi Maru"" is very ""Star Trek 2"" and the whole end with Kirk at the academy is very ""Star Trek 4"". The whole snow planet thing does feel a bit contrived to bring another character into it, and Nero is no Khan or Chang in terms of great Star Trek villains.<br/><br/>Negatives out of the way lets get onto the positives, and oh boy, the positives! Firstly the script and writing feel great, most of the references and the very few in-jokes work fabulously well. The performances in all the supporting roles, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty and Uhura are exemplary and they all play so well, in a film that could feel heavy or laden due to the complexities of the characters relationships. Now, lets get to the key triumvirate, McCoy, Spock and Kirk. These three performances steer the film along and make us feel like the original crew are still on board that ship. They work so damned well that I almost feel disloyal for enjoying them so much.<br/><br/>And now for the last crew member. The USS Enterprise. In all the good Trek films the Enterprise shots are things of beauty to behold, and this film is no exception. In battle mould, she looks stunning, in Warp drive she looks like an angel surrounded by light, it's so powerful. The direction of the rest of the team by J J is also glorious with the cinematography resembling the stunning photography and lighting used in Die Hard with arcs and halo's aplenty.<br/><br/>This is a great, great, blockbuster and one of the best Star Trek films ever, right up there with the unofficial trilogy of 2, 3 and 4.<br/><br/>May the new Star Trek live long at the cinema and Prosper."
"jdkraus","9","1","8","10 June 2009"," A feast for the eyes in almost every way...
","My knowledge of Stark Trek goes as far back as the 1980 film release ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". So, having not seen the original television series in the 60s, I did not know what J.J. Abrams was going to pull off. So far, from the work he has done, I've been impressed. With an open-mind, I went to see the film.<br/><br/>For starters, I will call it a feast for the eyes. The CGI is outstanding, and the photography plasters the scenes throughout the film beautifully. The works of the production, set, costume, and make-up design are exquisite. I evenly thoroughly enjoyed Michael Giacchino's epic score. In addition, J.J. Abram's use of hand-held camera and unique camera angles add to creativity of the film. <br/><br/>The cast, to a huge surprise, meshed into their roles perfectly. I'll be honest, I've never heard of most of the actors in the film before, but each of them is close to flawless. I will mention though that Zoe Saldana as Uharu was a disappointment. She has a great figure, but her acting is paper thin and rather annoying. Not giving too much of the plot away, it was a bigger let down that Kirk does not get the girl.<br/><br/>This maybe considered a good twist since it is typical in most modern-day films that the good guy gets the girl and rides off in the sunset with her, but I think the scriptwriters' choice of romance in the film was a mistake. <br/><br/>There are other things in the film that I found rather jarring, such as some of the character traits introduced in both Kirk and Spock. In the 1980s films, William Shatner stood as a guy who always won a fought, well, in this Star Trek, Kirk may throw the first punch in a brawl, but he then gets close to being dead many, many times in which some external force ends up saving him. As with Spock, well, I'll just say that I never imagined him as being such a jerk, but then again, the scriptwriters eventually make the two characters develop a respect for one another. <br/><br/>The remainder of the story was fine for such a big sci-fi epic. It's nothing Oscar worthy, but it stands as being creative, holding my interest from start to finish. Overall, Star Trek is a wonderful film that has brought back hope into the Star Trek franchise. If they make a second one, which I think the filmmakers will, I'll definitely be attending at a theater nearby. <br/><br/>My rating: ***1/2 out of **** <br/><br/>Don't wait for DVD, see it on the big screen!"
"jonathan-577","9","1","8","10 June 2009"," gloriously emotional space opera
","How much of it is me and how much of it is the movie? While I'm a Star Wars guy myself, I did grow up with the series, a Spock fan before I could write, and it goes without saying that this movie fully exploits the cultural benchmark it franchises: everyone can have fun with the uncanny casting, largely played for surprisingly deft comic relief. And while I could care less about the Trekkies, you can't help but admire the way this film sets out to circumvent purist quibbles: by opening up a channel in time, it creates an alternate 'reality'. This happily relieves the filmmakers of many cumbersome obligations to the source material, thus allowing it to concentrate on the true nucleus, the 'logic versus emotion' conflict embodied in the Kirk-Spock partnership. And by exploring this tension both between and within these characters, it achieves something quite remarkable. Not that I've been keeping track, but I doubt there are many space operas out there with this much invested in its characters - and with this kind of sweeping emotional resonance. Which immediately removes it from the Star Wars column and puts it closer to the epic war-buddy films of the classic Hollywood studio era - although I've never cared for one of those the way I care for this one. Shout out to Scotty's little green buddy, who astonishingly establishes himself as the most empathetic secondary character with about thirty seconds of screen time and zero words spoken."
"EUyeshima","8","1","8","9 June 2009"," Humanity Trumps Dazzling Effects in an Origins Prequel Not Exclusive to Trekkers
","It's a little-known fact that none other than Lucille Ball is responsible for the birth of ""Star Trek"". As the titular head of Desilu Studios in the 1960's, she green-lit former LA cop Gene Roddenberry's idea of an intergalactic western and championed the series during its brief three-year run on NBC. It is amazing to consider how the franchise continues to thrive 43 years later, so much so that director J.J. Abrams (""Lost"") and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have been able to re-imagine the legacy of the series without sacrificing the fidelity needed to satisfy the throngs of rabid fans who pushed the grosses north of the $200 million mark in its first week of release. As someone who is not remotely a Trekker, I have to admit the creators have done a fine job of reincarnating the familiar characters into their youthful counterparts and concocted an engaging, time-traversing plot that smartly avoids heavy exposition in favor of action and pyrotechnics. The result can be sometimes mind-numbing and trivial, but the 122-minute movie is never dull.<br/><br/>The densely populated plot throws us forward to the year 2233 (or backwards depending on your perspective on ""Star Trek"" lore) as the USS Kelvin confronts a major alien vessel captained by an embittered Romulan named Nero. An alternate timeline is revealed, and inevitable tragedies ensue. Years later, we meet the familiar characters from the TV series culminating in the USS Enterprise's maiden voyage. James Kirk is a cocksure hothead with obvious Starfleet Academy potential, but he is haunted by the father he never knew. The half-human, half-Vulcan Spock is a brilliant student-turned-control freak by his nature but sometimes unable to reconcile the two sides of his identity. Their initially hostile relationship provides much of the film's spark, as they one-up each other in face a common enemy in Nero. This provides a good excuse for the CGI-enhanced action sequences with a plethora of explosions and characters zooming in and out of frame. By the time you start to feel the excess and redundancy in this approach, the story wraps the viewer up in its core ethos - that the Enterprise crew is an extended rainbow coalition of a family even as entire civilizations are destroyed.<br/><br/>Abrams and crew are smart enough to recognize that the movie has to capture the heart of the original series in a way that doesn't patronize fans yet engage us non-Trekkers. Most of the casting choices are solid, although a couple of them are rather distracting. With the lightweight veneer of a tween idol, Chris Pine captures the braggadocio and roughhewn manner of a youthful Kirk in a way that tethers him to Shatner's real-life personality without doing an outright imitation of the elder actor. Even better is Zachary Quinto who has little latitude to vary Spock from fan expectation, yet he brings subtle but palpable currents of humanity to his stoic character. The rest of the crew is painted in broader strokes with Karl Urban coming closest to caricature as ""Bones"" McCoy; Anton Yelchin, laying on a thick, Cold War-era Russian accent as the extremely young Chekhov; and Simon Pegg (""Hot Fuzz"") pulling out all the comedy stops as exiled engineer Scotty. Somewhat more subtle are Zoë Saldana (""Guess Who"") as linguist specialist Uhuru, who has a surprising relationship with Spock, and John Cho (""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"") showing that he can handle action sequences with dexterity as neophyte helmsman Sulu.<br/><br/>Covered with latex, Eric Bana is hardly recognizable as Nero, although he makes the most of his character's stock vengeance motives. It's genuinely odd, however, to see Tyler Perry (""Madea Goes to Jail"") as the head of the Starfleet Academy and especially the still-doe-eyed Winona Ryder trying to look maternal as Spock's human-side mother. Among cinema's comic book franchises, this one is closer to ""The Dark Knight"" than ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" on the quality scale. Visually, it doesn't disappoint with Daniel Mindel's dazzling, kinetic cinematography and Scott Chambliss' creative production design that mixes retro and futuristic elements seamlessly. At the same time, the convenient timeline jumble doesn't really give rise to any complex moral quandaries beyond the importance of building friendships and trusting your colleagues. Nonetheless, the movie is propulsive entertainment which doesn't tamper with its genesis and focuses squarely on the humanity of the familiar characters. For that accomplishment, we should all be grateful."

","I am a fan of the original series from the day the series first started. I have loved all the versions of the franchise. I have seen every movie and I consider myself a hard core fan. To the rest of fellow hardcore fans I say....come on ""Get a life""(to quote Bill Shatner).<br/><br/>Compared to the very first Star Trek film...the boring ""Star Trek the Motion Picture"" this is a bloody masterpiece. Yes there are changes to the ""mythology"". But the basic dynamics of the characters are still there. Chris Pine does a fine job of portraying one possible version of Kirk as a young man. Zachery Quinto covers the bases as a young Spock. And someone better check if Deforest Kelly's ""Katra"" didn't somehow get deposited in Karl Urban as he nailed Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy's essence. The rest of supporting cast more or less captured their respective characters<br/><br/>Sure I had a bit of a problem with the Spock/Uhura romance as it felt a bit forced. But that is a minor complaint. I felt the movie captured the adventure aspects of the original as well as the adventure from Star Trek Wrath of Kahn Is it a coincidence that both films featured a villain out for revenge? I don't think so. Yes a lot of the philosophical aspects of the show were removed but this movie was intended to be an adventure so I felt it succeeded in its mission. Maybe later films will be more idea/concept oriented. But if you're going to ignite interest in this franchise beyond the die hard fans, this was the kind of movie that was needed.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned.....for Mr Abrahms, his writers, and this current cast of the Star Trek franchise...I say ""Live Long and Prosper"""

"bobbyfromsincity","9","1","8","1 June 2009"," Curse broken?
","It has always been known by us geeks that the Star Trek film series is cursed. It is said that a disgruntled ex-girlfriend (of Bill Shatner's, naturally) cursed the series upon being shafted by ol' Cap'n K. Generally, if a Trek film is an odd number, it'll suck, and an even number means more or less the opposite. This is the eleventh film of the series, and like most things Hollywood is churning out these days, it's a reboot. <br/><br/>But it's not. <br/><br/>It's clever. It's not a reboot in the traditional sense, and I don't want to spoil the film, so I'll leave it up to you discover what I mean. <br/><br/>The film itself puts a fresh new spin on the lore, and I think even purists will like it. It's got humour, it doesn't take itself too seriously and moves at a brisk (understatement) pace. <br/><br/>The time travelling shenanigans and plot most definitely contain holes, but the film moves so fast you barely have time to think. Instead, the immediacy creates what the best of the previous Star Trek films did; a thrill ride. And that's what you want from a summer blockbuster, especially in these dark economic times, right? <br/><br/>Right and wrong. Unlike most things Star Trek, this film doesn't wrap it's doings in political/social parallels (well, not as deeply), nor does it construct it's plot around these parallels. Instead going for pure action thrills at a breakneck pace. However this is a minor gripe, the film is filled with with nods to the original series and classic characters such as Bones, Kirk and Spock and portrayed well, while Uhura is given far more to do then I can ever remember her doing before. <br/><br/>How much depth can really be given to man like Kirk? Predictably, it's Spock who carries the emotional weight of the film. A child of two worlds, Spock is an emotionless and logical Vulcan, with everything emotional and illogical that comes with being human. <br/><br/>The film is easy viewing, and entertainment wise, no other Trek film has ever come close to this, okay, maybe wrath of Khan... The film does suffer from the old movie coincidences thing where people just happen to be in the right place at the right time, but all is forgiven when said and done. <br/><br/>The film is like the Iron Man to last years Dark Knight. A bright, breezy blockbuster of awesomeness to balance out the summer."

","This movie surprised me. I didn't think I would like it. But I did. I saw it a second time and, then I understood what they were doing. They were trying to draw in an audience that had been hostile to Star Trek, by making it more like Star Wars. Silly but fun. Stupid characters, with stupid lines, an implausible plot, and flashy special effects. And it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>This film restarts Star Trek. It is intended to draw you in. Once you get the point, you start to understand the idea behind Star Trek. You trust the characters portrayed on the screen. The movie tells you who to like, and who to dislike. Ultimately, you end up understanding everybody.<br/><br/>The relationship between Kirk and Spock is the heart and soul of the film. Both actors to a terrific job here, with Kirk's impulsiveness tempered by Spock's forced rationalism. Chris Pine is far more effective than Shatner ever was as an extremely bright and charismatically reckless commander. Zachary Quinto owns the young Spock, although his encounter with Leonard Nemoy's Spock sets up the possibility that we may see a different character emerge as this new series progresses. The other characters work well; funny, likable, but never overshadowing the primary focus of Kirk/Spock. <br/><br/>The thing that impressed me most was the CGI and the sound; this movie is watchable purely for those two elements alone. This is easily the most impressive spectacle I have ever seen in theaters. I would not advise you miss seeing this film in theaters for any reason. <br/><br/>Michael"

","I am surprised at the negative reviews of JJ Abram's ""Star Trek."" I walked out of the theater elated at the pure genius of the film. Of course as an aging ""baby boomer"" I grew up on the original Star Trek television series. The reason that I was elated is because I felt that Abrams had managed to capture the essence of those original characters in his young cast yet created something new.<br/><br/>Simon Cowell and the other judges of American Idol frequently encourage the singers to take the songs and make them something original and their own. This is what Abrams accomplished for me in his story. The characters all played their part as actors acting the characters of the original TV series, yet there was room for them to grow in new directions.<br/><br/>Because of the way the story ends, the scripting was brilliant in opening the door for the entire series to be redone with new stories using this new young cast. Star Trek is an American icon. Abrams treated the icon with respect and built the icon up even further. Peter Jackson did the same thing with his film version of Tolkien's, ""Lord of the Rings.""

A federation ship is attacked by a Romulan mining ship about 1,000 times its size. The new captain, realizing that either escape or fighting back is futile, evacuates the entire crew and to create a diversion, crashes the federation ship into the Romulan ship. Just before he dies, the captain's wife gives birth to his son, who is named James Tiberius Kirk.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie follows James Kirk and Spock through critical moments during their childhood and teenage years, leading up to their early days in the Starfleet Academy. The movie explains how the original crew of the Enterprise met and eventually came together. Truth to tell, I was never interested in these characters back stories at all in the past, but this movie made these iconic characters and their histories humanized and fully relatable (yes, even Spock, who supposedly has no emotions, has his softer side brought out).<br/><br/>Though played by different actors, the resemblance to the original cast is uncanny. Also, although the sets were obviously more advanced than the 1960's series, their uniforms and the spaceship have that 1960's vibe without being dated. Plus there are several odds twists in the movie that I will not reveal here but one of which is extremely clever on the director's part.<br/><br/>If you think it's starting to sound like a sci-fi ""Lifetime"" movie, trust me, it's not. There is tons of action, from start to finish. This film would give ""Die Hard"" a run for its money on the number of action sequences. It seems like Kirk gets beaten up about 43 times throughout this movie, but only suffers a few superficial scratches. That and a few of the plot devices, like how Kirk, 'grounded' for cheating on an exam, gets abroad the Enterprise, are a little far fetched at times, which is why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10. Other than that, it's a fantastic movie that I recommend all girlfriends of 'Star Trek' fans go see."

In my head I thought that this movie was going to be all boring and too much talking about stuff that makes no sense. I was totally wrong as I was glued to my seat and my eyes stared at the film for the whole thing. <br/><br/>I must admit that I never got to see the first minute, but I managed to figure out the whole story of the Star Trek series as before it I knew nothing about Star Trek. It wasn't just the story that amazed me, it was the CGI that did. Now I really hate some films with CGI, but this film was just so good with it, and I think that if they were to use CGI more sensibly then films like this one would be great! I also loved how the planets slowly were destroyed, which looked pretty cool. This film believe it or not, was really funny too. In fact, it was not just funny, it was sad, very sad.

I can see how the story could come off as contrived but I liked it anyway, much like last year's IRON MAN. I thought Bana was cool with what he had to work with and Chris Pine's Kirk was friggin awesome! The one thing that bother me in the whole movie was this: Kirk lands on the (Hoth-like) planet, meets old Spock, meets Scotty and beams aboard the Enterprise which is still in Hyper drive? Seriously? What's the point of Hyper drive if it takes forever to get there? Ha.

From the very beginning of the film until its 2+ hour finale, one will be drawn into the action and story taking place on the big screen.<br/><br/>The decision to ""reboot"" the franchise was necessary as it had grown old and stale under its last producers. The bold choices that Abrams made were quite refreshing. Some fans may not like slight departures from Trek ""cannon,"" but, as a fan of the franchise myself, I found them palatable and even needed.<br/><br/>Not since Star Trek IV has a Star Trek film been so audience-friendly to those only slightly acquainted with the original series. You need not know any of the back story to enjoy this film and those with such knowledge are advantaged only by knowing and better appreciating the origin of some of the phrases and other dialog that is used.<br/><br/>The acting is good and believable.

","Just saw the Star Trek movie and it was great. It's true what we've been hearing about this J J Abrams product...Somehow he managed the nifty balancing act of making the film accessible to non-Trekkies without dumbing or watering it down. My only complaint...not enough Scotty! Chris Pine as Kirk has it down. The backstory works, as does the way he plays a young adult James Tiberius Kirk... fearless horndog with a heart of gold ,major daddy issues and a wee bit of impulse control trouble. Honestly, though, there wasn't a bad piece of casting in the whole thing. I had never heard of anyone in the cast before other than Zachary Quinto playing Spock (this guy's creepy-yet-strangely-appealing performance as Sylar pretty much MADE the NBC series ""Heroes"" must-see-TV) and Simon Pegg playing Scotty (I had my doubts on a Brit doing a Scots accent/characterization, but as those who saw ""Shaun of the Dead"" know, the man is just plain flat-out funny and impossible to dislike for any reason). I didn't even know til I saw IMDb.com that Eric Bana was in the cast...he had the cojones to go into total unrecognizable alien villain mode (you can't in any way tell who it is behind the Romulan makeup). But all the major cast members both live up to their original-series reputations and put a little extra spin to it. I never watched ""Lost"" but can see Abrams has a major knack for managing large ensemble casts as he did there.<br/><br/>There are definitely sequels coming for this one...not just a ""logical"" conclusion to make, but obvious by what they seem to be saving for later...not a single Klingon to be found in this one! And unlike some films, this one actually DESERVES sequels!"

The special effects were spectacular, especially the scene on the drill over Vulcan and the action was fluid and easy to follow.

The direction really had me routing for all the goodies and the character building especially between Spok and Kirk was moving especially as you know they eventually will become good friends but are fighting and detest each other for the major part of the film. The way the familiar faces of the original bridge assemble their original posts was nicely portrayed and pleasantly surprising also.

This is a damn good movie, best I've seen this year, and to be honest I am looking forward to a sequel. Despite Chris Pine's reluctance to impersonate Bill Shatner's Kirk there are at least two scenes where he is pure ""Shatner"" Kirk... his cocky conduct during the Kobayshi Maru test, and the moment where Uhuru is asking him if he ""knows what he is doing"" in the captain's chair. Zach Quinto is just great as Spock, he really does encompass the role, and not only in looks. Can't wait until the DVD release! Enjoy!"

It takes the best of Star Trek and makes it appear new, and is clearly an excellent passage from old to new for both the series and fans alike. Leonard Nimoy is amazing and gives the rest of the cast a reason to step and make this the brilliant movie it is! I am trying to now spoil anything for who still have yet to see, but be prepared for things that will make you question your Star Trek knowledge for years to come. I can't wait for the next one and hopefully more after that. Beam me up Scotty! The doors have been opened to let another generation become 'Trekkies' and true fans!"

","Up front, I am not a loyal fan of Star Trek. I've probably seen between 12-15 episodes combined from all the series. I have seen all the movies and enjoyed them.<br/><br/>I felt this film was more about giving die-hard fans a chuckle than about reviving the series.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, don't get me wrong but I didn't think it was anything special.<br/><br/>The plot just was kind of thin. The basic premise and this contains spoilers, is that an angry Romulan (Nero) is able to come back in time and wreaks havoc. He blames Spock for everything and we learn that Spock is back from the future as well. So we have two Spocks now, young and really old. Leonard Nimoy plays old Spock to give this series some sense of continuity from the old series.<br/><br/>To me, the main plot was having young Spock and Kirk become friends and the whole planet destroying Romulan was just a backdrop to that. It would have been better if they had fleshed out the villains more.<br/><br/>The acting was good, the special effects were outstanding and the there were some funny moments (more so if you are a big fan).<br/><br/>I felt that the writers were simply looking to recreate the original series and had to invent ways to get all the characters back on one ship. Again, I think this was done to amuse the die-hard fans than to advance the plot.<br/><br/>If you are a die-hard fan, you'll probably love this movie. If you are just a casual fan or have little experience with Star Trek then you'll enjoy this movie but won't consider it anything spectacular."

This movie breaks away from the standard ""over-the-top"" boy-scout characters of previous movies and us some good ""edgy"" characters instead.<br/><br/>The movie is mainly centered around Kirk and how he came to be in command of the Enterprise, in a time of crisis. It's grand in scope and you get to meet all the principal Trek characters all over again. Except this time their younger, edgier and some things about them are different... it's all explained in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot going for it - fantastic visuals, fast pacing and interesting characters. The Spock and Kirk roles were cast very well and the rest of the cast does a fine job as well.<br/><br/>IMAX: Don't worry if you don't see it in IMAX - it's not a real IMAX movie (it was 'enlarged' to fit IMAX, not filmed in IMAX). I liked it fine on the huge screen, but you might actually get a crisper image on a normal sized theater screen.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful summertime sci-fi action flick for just about everyone.

"VTMChris","4","1","8","9 May 2009"," Not the worst Star Trek Movie
","Please note, this contains SPOILERS, please do not read this until after you have viewed the film! This is definitely not the worst Star Trek film ever made. I believe Star Trek V, Insurrection, and Nemesis (take your pick) remain my least favorites.<br/><br/>This is definitely outside the Star Trek canon as it means the end of one of the founding Federation planets before the original series even began. I cannot reconcile this movie with the original series, Next Generation, etc, etc...<br/><br/>It was entertaining, although several scenes seem to have little to do with the movie and would have been best left on the editor's floor including one scene that had Willy Wonka written all over it. I have been a strong believer that the franchise should be allowed to rest for at least 10 - 20 years after the end of Voyager. This movie belongs in the same non-canonical alternate history that Star Trek: Enterprise belongs in.<br/><br/>The best things I can say about this film: Leonard Nemoy's role was good, and the movie was generally well cast. The special effects were good. The comedy was generally appropriate and it was truly refreshing to return to a more serious movie, in my opinion this is the first movie since the Search for Spock that comedy was not the central theme."
"socrates99","9","1","8","9 May 2009"," Just saw this on a huge screen with near perfect sound and seating
","My wife enjoyed the film, and don't get me wrong, so did I, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. The digitized graphics were OK but nothing particularly awesome, and, in fact, the constant motion was fairly annoying. You aren't going to get a chance to marvel at someone's design tour de force, but I'm not sure there were many. The sets were quite derivative of the originals which is to say they may be pretty much 'Star Trek' true, but they're oddly dated today. In fact, now that I think of it, the main leads were also fairly dated as to range of reaction and general attitudes, though probably at near twice normal speed. Still, this is a fun-filled send off of a new crew with a slightly off tone Spock and Kirk. With a stronger storyline this could get engrossing. I generally enjoy the next generation's reworking of any of the old icons. Often they actually step things up a level. This isn't a bad movie. It's just hyped a little too much. I suspect the director is not really a sci-fi fan, and that would have made a real difference.<br/><br/>FLASHFORWARD<br/><br/>I've now seen the DVD and am a little disturbed to find myself revising the marks I had originally given this movie, revising them higher. The thing is, this movie violates some of my favorite movie tenets like 'don't invent scenes just to get cute about something you can do'. But, you know what? I was wrong. It was worth risking the wrath of people like me. In fact the more I think about this, J J Abrams might be becoming my favorite entertainer, which is what he is. And, especially telling, I completely admire how Pine and Quinto have made this their own franchise. There's a grasp of risk taking laced with quick but thorough thinking that I've never seen before in a sci-fi movie. All the jumps in probability are all for a good cause, a rousing good time"

I don't know about anyone else but I would love to have seen the academy training more than another phaser being fired.<br/><br/>This major gripe aside the best moments are those with Leonard Nimmoy who really does have a gravitas about his role.<br/><br/>All in all, too much eye candy, and just not enough brain food.

","I want to give it a ten, I truly do. I'll keep this short, or as short as I can keep it Jim.<br/><br/>It's a truly mesmerizing, accomplished piece of cinema. There are just a couple of things that mean it doesn't strike the bullseye this time around. No doubt this will be revised, but here is version 1.<br/><br/>From start to finish ST entertains. In the 'downtime' the visuals and homages make it impossible to tear our eyes from the screen let alone take a bathroom break. We went to the IMAX, and it is there that good heavens, I've almost flown in space.<br/><br/>I'm not a 'Trekkie' or 'Trekker', I'm merely a geek who likes and appreciates the show but did not grow up on it. This does not matter. For once, somehow they manage to make a film that has something for everyone .. for everyone without being distasteful with the usual obligatory adult humour. They bring ST into the millenia without any real compromise to the spirit. It's like they took the series and gave it a completely new gloss without changing or barbarising the characters. There is evident care and attention to detail, it's plain to see. All the actors are strong. The only really niggle, if I had to have one would be that Zachary Quinto. If you don't know his name you soon will, it will be a fluent household name soon- is 98 percent on par with 'Spock'. He has the character, he's put work in, there is just a very narrow margin between theatrical acting and the complete embodiment of 'Spock'. I'm not asking for Spock Spock, it's just that he appears to be swimming in the waters of the character without being completely confident to surf the waves seamlessly. This will come in time, it's not an easy role to take on. The favourites, it would appear besides J Tiberius himself (and Spock) are Dr. McCoy and Nimoy himself. Karl Urban has never sounded so good. What an actor, Eomer then Bourne 2 assassin and now a character I feel he was almost born to play. Scotty doesn't appear until a good two thirds into the film, but his is an instantly applauded crowd pleaser. They could not have selected a better actor. Simon Pegg is to films and sci-fi what Gordon Ramsey is to food. The rest of the cast are very enjoyable, strength where there is room for weakness and gaping potholes just waiting for the wrong kind of laughter. It's 11:30 at night and I need to wrap this up. One last minor gripe that robs it of the ten (at least on my first viewing) is some of the camera work. On two occasions where there is fighting, it becomes hard to tell what is happening. It's not quite Bourne shaky, but it is sufficient for the viewer to lose sight of who is kicking who's butt. Those technicalities asside- IMAX ladies and gentlemen. Some of the most incredible special effects. Space panoramas and ship battles you are likely to behold for a long long time. This is a thrill ride that will leave the viewing thinking for some time. The plot, ah yes I almost forgot, as far as I am concerned is irrelevant and something that serves purely to stick the characters together. People don't really care about the plot, they just sit back and set phasers to WOW!<br/><br/>What's next, blu ray baby.<br/><br/>9 and a half out of ten."

Bit narced about Simon Pegg not being in it much(trying not to give too much away) Loved the special effect, acting was top notch. The only niggle i had was when Kirk meets Leonard Nimoy.

","I have seen some Star Trek episodes on TV, but not very much. I am, however, a fan of J.J. Abrams (Cloverfield, M:I III) and therefore quite hyped for the movie. And it sure wasn't a letdown.<br/><br/>It's a sci-fi adventure movie, with lots of action. It's presented in a way that not only the Trekkies would like it. For example the introduction of Kirk. As a young boy he steals an old-timer with Sabotage by the Beastie Boys playing in the background. This is far too mainstream to be in an old Star Trek movie, but it fits in this one.<br/><br/>It fits because the movie is a blockbuster, and you know it is when the movie starts and the music kicks in. The music is done very well and enhances the (great!) special effects. The movie also features some good humor.<br/><br/>However, it's more than a blockbuster, the story is compelling. It's essentially all about emotions. Spock doesn't show his emotions and Kirk is all too trigger happy with his emotions. Spock's story about showing it's emotions is the main one and Kirks character falls a little bit flat. Also the story might get a bit confusing when time travel comes into play. But not too worry, it doesn't matter all that much and you can still enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a very good watch and I look very much forward to the next movies."

Star Trek is an exhilarating adrenaline rush of epic action sequences and visual effects that surpass any other Trekkie film of its kind. There are many haters out there on this movie stating it does not stay 'True' to the genre but i don't think they understand the concept of a REBOOT. A film in which you don't have to know anything about the series of Star Trek or any of its predecessors to enjoy.

The action setpieces are well made, time travel is handled well and the cast is uniformly entertaining (even Quinto, who I'm still not convinced can pull off anything other than Sylar). The reboot structure involving time travel is unique. Eric Bana is a great villain, unfortunately underused.<br/><br/>However, I can't help but feel a Batman Begins syndrome is going to happen with this version of Star Trek.

No that anyone wouldn't find this movie to be very entertaining...just may add a little more enjoyment factor in being familiar with the old series. The movie actually tells the story of how all of the original series characters came to be and how they ended up paired together. The great thing about the approach taken by the director of this movie is that the cast approached the original characters determined to keep the original quirkiness but still keeping the dialog and acting controlled...not overdoing it which resulted in a much more humorous, intelligent movie. Do yourself a favor and get out to see this flick."

","I am a big fan of the ,,Star Trek'' series . Unfortunately the last 2-3 movies weren't very good , so - I expected a promising reboot , at least worth to watch . But , on the end , I was extremely surprised ! This movie is better than all the other series (put together) !!! The visual effects were awesome . The actors - perfect . Chris Pine really looks like a leader , like one true captain of Enterprise . Zachary Quinto plays Spock - my favourite character . I can just say that Quinto looked like a real Vulcan-Human Hybrid . He did his job perfect as a first commander of the ship , most importantly - he was the coooooooooooolest ! What about the script , the other characters , the story ? Perfect too . This movie is something more than a reboot - this is a new beginning of the era , called Star Trek ."
"TKoote","8","1","9","29 May 2009"," Best Sci-Fi Film I've Ever Seen
","To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Star Trek. His baldness and the strange-eared never appealed to me and therefore I've never watched more than one episode, but the spectacular trailer got me interested. Could Star Trek finally be cool? First of all, the director. J.J. Abrams is one of the finest directors of this time. With Cloverfield he proved he has a new, fresh look on former styles and trends. With Star Trek he proves it again. The directing is absolutely brilliant and as a non-Trekkie I was immediately sucked into the movie.<br/><br/>The realism was interesting too. It's logical that Sci-Fi movies have strange creatures and machinery, because in space, you never know what will happen. Star Trek however, differs from this. You have ordinary guns and ordinary clothes. The thing that got me noticed that even the ""aliens"" all look remarkably human. I only noticed three real different creatures.<br/><br/>Then the CGI. It was magnificent. Not a good movie though when you're epileptic. The whole film has this massive CGI-sets when hundreds of little ships attack for instance the Enterprise and lots of explosions and debree follows. Most impressive was the destroying of ""the"" planet though. That was seriously impressive stuff.<br/><br/>As the whole film was actually. The acting is good, the story is good, the action is great and the CGI is unexceedable. Fantastic film."

","I have been a Star Trek fan most of my life. I can honestly say this movie was probably one of the best (If not the best) Treks I've ever seen! I can't wait for the DVD to come out. What's more I can't wait for the sequel! and it looks very likely that their will be a sequel. And with a movie this good, you can't expect anything other than the huge success it's enjoying!<br/><br/>The things that made it great where: The story was fantastic, people who weren't already fans of Trek could really get into it, it wasn't hard to understand, but it was still very intelligent. The music was superb! it gave it a very grand and exciting feeling! The effects where top of the line, and just plain brilliant! The humor gave it a more personal quality, so it didn't feel as stiff as it could have been. And the acting was top-notch. They really hit the nail on the head by picking the unknown Chris Pine to play James Kirk. Not only does he look like William Shatner did when he first started playing Kirk, but his acting was exceptional. And there was Zachary Quinto, he did the part of Spock so much justice, it's hard to see anyone else play him. And there was the surprise appearance of Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) playing Older Spock. He really tied the story together. And not to forget, there was also the wonderful performances of Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, Karl Urban, and Eric Bana. Also the children that played Kid Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) and Kid Spock (Jacob Kogan) gave masterful performances for the short background story parts they where tasked with.<br/><br/>So that is why I say this movie was a triumph in every way! Not just as a Star Trek film but as any film! I give this movie a 10 out if 10! If they'd let me I'd give it a 20 out of 10!!!"
"lukepic123","10","1","9","27 May 2009"," The only direction star trek could go
","It's more generic than any star trek movie before, it doesn't break new ground in STAR TREK storytelling because the plot isn't quite as deep as others have been. Forgetting the deepness of the plot we get the first chance to see the startrek universe in all it's glory with spectacular effects and lovely sets. The direction style is brilliant, your sucked into the film very early on, in fact the first scene sucks you in and doesn't let you go after. This has never been achieved in any star trek film before now except maybe first contact but again wasn't half as intense as this. You look at where startrek has taken us with all the series and movies, basically JJ Abrams looked at it all and decided to give more of what you wanted which is action and for startrek to be given the full money treatment. He succeeded in making a greatly entertaining and pleasure to watch film. You will find startrek fans who see the original startrek for how it was and aren't open to the slightest of style change, you will probably find the film hard to stomach. This is because the fact is after Nemesis (which i liked btw) there was no where else to go with the TNG crew, and basically all the series have had long runs and what else could be done? I think what this movie has achieved is showing not only a general audience these wonderful original series characters but because of the new cast gives the chance of fans to see new sides of the crew, a prequel was definitely the way to go and with the curse of sci-fi prequels always failing startrek had a difficult job but they did it, this is the best prequel I've ever seen which didn't suck in a way which upsets and ruins franchises. This is because the people who made this film cared, when you watch this film you see care and time that has been put into making it right.<br/><br/>The cast, they were all brilliant. Kirk won't win you over at first, basically he has to grow into becoming Kirk which by the end he does. Spock is fantastic, Quinto brought Spock new levels of character and has made him into an even more interesting character than ever before. McCoy was almost like the original and this is perfect, McCoy was by far capturing the original spirit of the character to the full. The rest were likable and great to watch, well casted. Only thing I'd also say is you have to get used to Chekov's ULTRA thick Russian accent, i kinda laughed a little when i first heard it but once your used to it he's good too.<br/><br/>Going back to the plot, it is rather linier in it's design but the clever thing about it is how it manages to make the film fit in with canon.<br/><br/>In conclusion it's a startrek movie for everyone go and see it, enjoy it and save picking holes for later, Star Trek is back and it's wonderful!"
"robdrinx","8","1","9","27 May 2009"," I disagree with the other comment and think it was a pretty good movie.
","I disagree with the previous comment, I just saw this movie and it pays homage to the original series very well. I think that they did an excellent job trying to keep the original fans happy while bringing the story back to the mainstream. Of course this movie is going to look more ""Hollywood"" with the advancements in CGI. As far as the bad youth comment: all people have trials that they deal with as a youth, some are more influential than others, but they are what make you who you are...or rather how you face them is what makes you who you are. They wouldn't be in Star Fleet if they didn't excel at what they do. I wish that they had shown more of early lives of the characters to balance it out but it's not something that you can do in a 2 hour movie and still get the story across. The story does develop it's just different than what happened in the previous movies. All of the fight scenes make sense when you take in the whole movie. The end tends to rap up plot points that are left hanging throughout.<br/><br/>Just a thought."

I can't wait until the DVD comes out!!! This movie explained the earlier lives of the Star Ship crew! Chris is what I imagine a young captain Kirk would have been in his youth. The movie explained how Captain Kirk and Spock initially did not like each other, but later formed a lasting bond! I wonder how they will develop Uhura's feelings for Spock and later they are not romantically involved. I don't remember in the original Star Trek that Uhura and Spock kissed!!!!

"Colbtron","9","1","9","23 May 2009"," Star Trek - Where more than one man has gone before, but we still want to go.
","Star Trek is a franchise that was created in the 60s, but seems to have a timeless quality. It echoes all great literature in humanity; from genesis stories of ancient Persia, to Shakespeare, and exceeds any science textbook ever written. For that reason it has become the quintessential science fiction work of all time. Campy, primary colour TV show, to 90s special effects and sci-fi pioneer, to the current 11th film created by Hollywood sweetheart JJ Abrams.<br/><br/>Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry. Over the years, it has been taken upon shoulder like the world on Atlas' shoulder, and taken in new, but not always welcome, directions. Star Trek: The Motion Picture took a small show to the big screen. Nimoy and Shatner bolstered the films in new and often fun ways in the continuation of the original series on the big screen. No one could have predicted the impact of the Next Generation. Headed by over qualified Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart, Star Trek the Next Generation introduced the intelligence and polished future of Star Trek to a new and welcoming audience, allowing the brightest writers and special effects artists to ply their trade on prime-time television. This new movie, however, is something completely different.<br/><br/>I remember the campy optimism of original Trek. I loved the exciting and unique adventures of the cast of the Next Generation. I tolerated and was sometimes pleased by the following series. They always made you think, even if you new that the potential had been long gone.<br/><br/>The new movie is a new adventure. The characters are the same, but they look different, they move differently, they occupy a different universe. It isn't the flip-switch or microwave oven touch screen of the Star Trek you've seen before. The set isn't perfectly lit and exquisitely sculpted in some kind of futurist dream. It's a wild west of unknown space and the best technology available - which means that nothing works as it's supposed to, and only the stuff these ensigns has learned on their own can help. In keeping, only the natural instincts of James T. Kirk can allow them to survive. There's no intellectual discussion of theoretical physics or rewiring of futuristic hardware. The characters have to use their strengths to get them through. Do you want to join them, or would you rather watch Deep Space 9 reruns? Answer that question, and you'll discover whether you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>I liked it, but I'm looking forward to more. JJ, read up and start writing boldly about new life, civilizations and new places where no one has been before. I know it will look good."
"jethi_95","10","1","9","22 May 2009"," Totally awesome wicked!
","This movie was totally awesome. The plot is basically, Spock and Kirk's early lives, and then how they meet, and then their first mission together, and their problems with each other being worked out.Although there weren't any Klingons,this movie stays true to the original. I would give it a ten in all categories. Abrams sure knew what he was doing when he made this thing. All the actors were perfect and their were few plot holes or goofs. I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but this movie rocked. With a realistic no-sound outer space and wicked space and ground fights, this movie would definitely make my top 10 list. Hardly any sexual content, quite a bit of awesome space fights, and some swearing, this movie was incredible."

This movie is almost a copy of Nemesis and everybody liked it!<br/><br/>I like this movie, good visual effects, some George Lucas aliens ( OK, I hated them ). Very good Actors, but the script... too random and maybe too much effort to catch a new generation of trekkies. The way all crew members join the Enterprise especially scooty, and James Kirk Car robber sequence are examples.<br/><br/>I really think this movie shouldn't be compared to any previous Star Trek movie.

","This movie was amazing and stayed true to the original. The question I have is, ""Is it a prequel or a sequel?"". I feel this is either a sequel or the beginning of a completely different series. There are many references to the previous Star Trek films. I feel this was a sequel because it presents Spock and Nero from present going back in time and consequently changing the past. This can't be a prequel because now that the past has been changed of course the future has been changed as well. What they have created is a beginning of an alternate reality/future. I am excited to see what will happen in this alternate future."
"jhmocha","9","1","9","20 May 2009"," Finally! A Star Trek MOVIE!!!
","11th time is a charm as they say.<br/><br/>Now I'm not putting down the other ten Star Trek ""movies"", they're good. A few of them are really good. But I was always bothered by the fact that, while they were more of a production than the TV episodes, they seem to have been produced with restraint. Perhaps it was an effort to maintain the feel of the beloved TV show, or perhaps the studio just didn't have enough faith in Star Trek to amplify the budget. Regardless, I see Star Treks 1-10 as films that missed the point of exactly what they were. When you make a movie based on a popular TV show, step up the game! Make it a true event.<br/><br/>Finally, Star Trek got the budget it deserves and the treatment it deserves. This movie is a fun ride. I wasn't around for the original TV series (but was a TNG fan), and can completely understand that some fans will be upset with some of the drastic changes to the plot, but if you consider Star Trek's problematic grip its always had on a mainstream audience, you'll have to accept them. The formula behind Trek was perfectly fine for its fans. This movie just trims some of the scientific and political fat while relying on all the great characters and humor to create a refreshing view of everything else Star Trek always had that most people took for granted.<br/><br/>Now the cast of this movie lacks the charisma of the original, but then they did have 30 years to perfect that. Also, Star Trek was generally a mystery show, and this film is undeniably an action movie with very little mystery included. I wonder if the next project will be truer to those roots, or if they will stick to what works for the box office. I'll be very interested to see how they do in the future. (really not meant as a pun, but I guess it works)"
"darksidekairi","10","1","9","18 May 2009"," Star Trek was the best film ever!!!
","Yeah!!! You lot may as well say it was rubbish and disappointing but are you real Trekkie's? It was not a rip off from Star Wars because Star Trek was made first and Delta Vega was clearly already there and has no relation to Star Wars cos they may as well have stuck the death star in the film while they were at it. The beginning was good and had its own beat in the Hella Bar when you see Uhura for the first time. Abrams was sneaky with the time line and the Warp and transporter was amazing!!!<br/><br/>The special effects were wonderful, even i wanna go space jumping now, it was that good. The bits where McCoy was injecting Kirk was hilarious and when he cursed at Spock and even the cameo appearance from Leonard Nimoy. A feature i spotted in the trailer, the alternate trailer. <br/><br/>But it's based on a what if scenario whereas most Trekkies can go back to the whole normal time line. This was an amazing reboot and well worth watching I think, even if others don't. I have seen it 3 times already. Go see it those who haven't."
"dsmgdesign","7","1","9","17 May 2009"," For better or worse: A re-imagined Star Trek
","I can understand why hard core fans hated this film. And, I can understand why those unfamiliar with Canon loved it. I'm one of those fans that falls somewhere in between and can be slightly more objective. I admit I don't study the Star Trek Canon and I've never been to a convention. But still there are a few things that bother me, even if I'm supposed to believe this is an alternate reality.<br/><br/>Lets start with the core character, the hero of the movie, Kirk. Kirk was a reckless, womanizing maverick in the original trek. Yet, tactically, he was as clever as a fox. He knew how to boldly save lives, and that made him indispensable as a Captain. The producers captured this core essence of Kirk, and offered a more animated version of it. He seemed destined for star fleet but was an undisciplined train wreck at the same time. I think the change in his history and the loss of a father figure in his life had something to do with this. Was he promoted to first officer? Yes, but Pike saw something in Kirk that the rest of didn't see in this edited 2-hour fast paced movie, I suppose Pike was something of a cowboy himself, and these were desperate times. Afterall, Vulcan was under attack. Even with all this, I do agree it was a reach for his to be promoted so suddenly.<br/><br/>Spock. The young Spock (or even Nimoy himself) wasn't Vulcan enough for my taste. They both seemed a little bit too much in touch with their human side. Could this be explained by being emotionally conflicted due to the destruction of Vulcan: perhaps. <br/><br/>The destruction of Vulcan bothers me. Yes, I understand, this is a different reality, so the producers feel they could take liberties. But the Vulcan home world means something tremendously to the Star Trek Universe. A good analogy would be: destroying Vulcan to Trekkie's is a bit like burning the American flag to veterans and patriots.<br/><br/>Star Trek does mean something else to Trekkie's that was not captured in this newest film, and I believe the hard core fans do deserve more. Now, for the younger audience, who know little about Star Trek, I'm not one of them, so I really don't know. But I would have to imagine they thought this movie was breath-taking. <br/><br/>Here's the rub. The Star Trek franchise has not been doing so well. The previous two movies were box office flops. I guess the producers felt making a Star Trek film that was true to Canon and 100% accurate with characters who were created in the 60's wouldn't make much money. You know what? It's hard to hear, but they were probably right.<br/><br/>I think the producers were hoping bringing a villain in from the future would give them liberties to change the time line and they hoped this would satisfy those who follow Canon. And, it would provide them with a great story for the younger crowd at the same time. They were half right. Hard Core Trekkie's would still find holes, and they did. And, some of those unfamiliar with Canon might find this movie to be just remotely cooler than transformers.<br/><br/>Having said all this, I liked the movie. It was a bit of a guilty pleasure. I think it started out fast and furious, the characters weren't as developed as in a true trek film, the story was predictable, implausible and not in keeping with star fleet's code of conduct. But I enjoyed Seeing Leonard Nimoy reprise his role as Ambassador Spock. I was not completely offended enough to enjoy seeing fresh faces take on the roles introduced so long ago. Star Trek does mean something to hard core Trekkie's. But it means more to the history of film. If making a 100% canon film meant the further deterioration of a franchise that I feared faced extinction, then bring on the re-imagined movie! Despite its flaws, it also breathed new life and rejuvenated the franchise and, in the process, it quite possibly made some new fans. Yes, the Trekkies deserve more, and I hope they get more in the films to follow. But this movie does not deserve a rating of 1, 2 or anything below a 5. It was a good movie. I didn't feel like I was watching Star Wars, or Transformers, or even Superman Returns. I felt like I was watching something much, much smarter. On its own merits, it was wildly entertaining, a great thrill ride, the writing was smart (for the most part), the story was solidly told (again, for the most part), it was brilliantly directed, and the acting was exceptional. <br/><br/>Bottom line: If you don't have a Star Trek reference book of any kind on your book shelf, or Vulcan ears in your closet, then see this movie on the big screen and enjoy. Then go home, scratch your head and hope for something a little better next time."

I've seen many of the original ""Star Trek"" episodes and movies, and although I can see why some die-hard trekkies and others wouldn't have enjoyed this movie for a few reasons, it's a real joyride, a great story, and as I have to re-iterate the characters were very well played.

","I'd never watched anything of Star Trek, so I had no expectations when I went to the movies, but this one really surprised me. The facts shown happened before everything that people know about the series, which means it's like an explanation of the original Star Trek. This may explain why people that have never watched Star Trek before like this movie. The two hours passes through very quickly, the action really catches your attention and the story itself demands you some thinking, what brings you totally into the movie. The special effects are perfect, the acting is convincing (even Zachary Quinto's... it's almost impossible not to remember Sylar, but he did a great job) and the end is predictable, but also gripping. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes action gathered with a well planned plot. And of course, to all the old fans of the 60's series."
"mexicospidergreen","10","1","9","16 May 2009"," Next time you want a reboot done right, call JJ Abrams right away
","It's been 5 years since the last Star Trek, and now Trekkies have been waiting for a reboot of the popular franchise. Fortunately director JJ Abrams knows how to do just that, and make Star Trek enjoyable for Trekkies and non Trekkies alike. Like X-Men Origins, we go back to the beginning, and in this case we get the back story of James T. Kirk before he was captain of the enterprise. As a boy he always found himself in some sort of trouble by starting bar fights, and stealing cars. An opportunity soon comes to redeem himself when he is appointed Chief and Star ship captain of the Enterprise. There, he jumps off into space bringing along a series of mischievous situations and befriends a young captain named Spock. Together they must travel the galaxies and save the Earth from destruction. Let me start off by saying that JJ Abrams knows exactly how to reboot a franchise. He does it by adding incredible Special Effects, exciting action sequences, and casting Simon Pegg. By the time the closing credits rolled, everyone in my theater applauded including the non-Trekkies. This is a primary example of what a summer film should be like. Mostly we get movies that are out of the blue and loaded with action fare extravaganza during summer but rarely, do we get movies that have a unique story, great visual effects, and comedy. Star Trek is able to deliver all of that with a 2 hour running time. On the downside I was expecting more Simon Pegg in the movie and he didn't show up till half way. His character was the icing on the cake. But apart from that if you're looking for a feel good, action packed summer adventure then look no further."

","Being a long time Trekkie, sci-fi/fantasy fan, and regular movie goer I had my doubts about a new Star Trek film. My wife and I went this evening to see it and I was more than pleasantly surprised, as was my wife. In most cases remakes and sequels have a tendency to hardly ever live up to the original and often massacres what was originally a very good story. In this case, this was altogether a grand success in both mine and my wife's opinion. Her experience with Star Trek mainly involves some episodes of ST: TNG, so she only went because I wanted to go, but she came out nearly raving about how great she thought this movie was. I have loved ST since first seeing Captain James T. Kirk take the captains chair when I was a child, it may well have been the root of my love of sci-fi and fantasy. <br/><br/>Going in to see this film I had my doubts and hopes as well. Going all the way back and giving the series a new starting point and a new spin. Almost a new universe for grand new adventures! I sincerely hope that the this rebirth gives rise to additional movies and the possibilities of new series for TV."

I am definitely going to watch this movie multiple times.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few parts that seem very unrealistic(as stated by some people who were disappointed they didn't use the beam to kill the enemies instead of sending people to do it). Well, yeah a lot of things could have happened differently, but then the movie would not be as climatic. For example, wouldn't the ship know if it was too close to a black hole and avoid it? Or maybe the planet would have a little defense against a huge drill thingy invading your entire planet!? Yeah.<br/><br/>It's a futuristic action movie. A lot of things could have been avoided or destroyed.<br/><br/>But other than that, I am not a Star Trek fan, but my friend is and he thought it was a great movie. He was laughing through it though. I thought it had a pretty good story and battles going on. Some funny parts too. It isn't as much of a ""serious Star Trek"" type movie. So people who are very disappointed, that doesn't mean that the movie was bad, it just means that it wasn't what they were hoping it would be. Obviously it was meant to reference a lot from older Star Trek, but also make it enjoyable for the masses.<br/><br/>I am definitely buying the DVD for this one."

","To those of you 'Trekkies' (No I will not say Trekker) who walked out at the near halfway point of the film, and you know who you are... stupid. Accept change. For months we've seen the catchphrase ""This is not your father's Star Trek"", but it is still Gene Roddenberry's tale of 'Wagontrain to the stars'. From the start, if you are accepting of change, this film kicks off with a hellava bang and rolls pretty well. Those who may also be comic book geeks would recognize this film as a 'What If..?' or 'Elseworlds' tale, asking the question of ""What would happen if..?"" and giving us a very imaginative yet faithful answer. No one said this was TOS redone, but TOS reborn. Since we already know the set standard of time in the Trek Universe (even the errors and mistakes in continuity), isn't it just really damn cool to start over, yet not, all at the same time? J.J. Abrhams brought to the film what the feature film series needed two decades ago... a big name director with big time vision. Wise, Meyer, Nimoy and Frakes all did great jobs (as did those who remain nameless for what they had to work with), but the franchise long ago required a Spielberg or Jackson or as it almost was once upon a time, a Lucas to bring the vision of wild west in space to vivid light (or Idustrial Light and Magic). Yes, plenty of you hardcore to the death 'Trekkies' will curse J.J.'s name wish him death for changing your precious universe, but that's your loss for not recognizing a change for the better. (We all remember how Tasha Yar became a Romulan do we not?) Its not a prequel technically, its not an update or really even a 'reboot', but it is epic in scope given the vast material which preceded it. Very well paced with action, drama, humor and place-setting (oh the joy of sequels) it is a great new look at our old favorites (most of the actors partially picked and approved by TOS vet Nimoy). Worthy of the tag 'epic' and a must see for any science fiction fan or real movie buff. Bring popcorn and bathroom breaks forbidden."

","I went to see Star Trek having hated every single series before and moaning to my dad whenever he decided he wanted to watch an episode.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a good old battle scene which, if I must admit was very short lived. That I find is a crucial reason why I didn't give this movie the full marks which it good've got from me. The final battle scene and the first battle scene- although uses great usage of SFX- was so short that by the time the scenes had finished, you'd only just got into them. On the other hand; it is a refreshing change from the now necessary urge of director's to make huge battle scene's which go on for over 1/2 hour, I'll let you make your own choice.<br/><br/>Apart from this point, the movie is pretty awesome. The special effects are amazing and so are the sets. The plot centres around the rescue of the commander of enterprise and also James Kirk's urge to become the captain of the enterprise.<br/><br/>All in all, if you want a great movie with amazing special effects then this is the movie for you. However if you want a movie with huge battle scenes. Don't bother"
"Otoboke","Null","1","9","11 May 2009"," Star Trek as the bold, exciting and culturally relevant form of entertainment that it could once claim to be.
","Star Trek; it goes without saying that even the slightest mumble of its title is sure to evoke multitudes of images concocted into the mind of anyone with the slightest interest in popular culture. As a form of entertainment, art and cult-culture obsession for fans all over the world, the franchise as it stands represents many things and stands as a modern-day phenomenon not just for the stereotypical ""nerds"" usually associated with the series, but to casual fans of TV and movies in general. With so many instalments inherent to the canon of Trek's universe however, the task of building a brand new feature set to welcome in newcomers as well as serve to the long-time admirers, is a task that eventually killed off what was once a dominant feature on household television sets for the best part of two decades.<br/><br/>For Star Trek, the adage that familiarity breeds contempt eventually began to ring louder than captain Jean Luc Picard's monologues and the ho-humming of the tired Enterprise and its tepid crew. The stories and settings were the same old hogwash recycled and rebranded—there was a lack of imaginative adventure, and a certain amount of the magic that propelled the original series into the culturally significant icon that it had become, had all but died. So it is with the dawning of a new age of the franchise—after a brief four year absence from screens large and small—that those central ideas inherent to the soul of Star Trek and its ability to entertain whilst maintaining a culturally relevant stance that is both progressive and deeply rooted in humanity; that those ideas must be firmly established in a movie that also walks the often dauntingly fine line between polarising esoteric fan-pandering and daring, new and refreshing up-hauling.<br/><br/>And yet, faced with a task that—like Spock's infallibly complex algorithms—is more or less designed without hope of a one-hundred-percent positive outcome, writers Orci and Kurtzman actually pull it off. Sure, the entire premise of the feature is based upon the fact that all history as has been documented by the TV shows is now negated because of time-travel complications and paradoxes which makes the entire procedure one that can be appreciated ""as is"" for both new and old fans alike—but the delicacy and amount of detail that is packed in amongst the loosely connected timelines if formidable and works as a singular entity in itself. The result is a time-travel science-fiction story with Romulans and other assorted deformed-forehead aliens that doesn't feel like one, and for all the right reasons.<br/><br/>Even with paradoxes, multiple realities and distorted timelines however, some things never change. Thankfully, one of these constants resides within the realm of character for Star Trek which sets about building upon established character traits and relationships known for forty years without succumbing to mere parody. For all intents and purposes, Star Trek as it is portrayed here is essentially a story built as a testament to the legacy of esteemed rebel and starship captain James T. Kirk played by a young, energetic and charismatic Chris Pine. The character is defined here with shades of his former self kept in check consistently with a new-found sense of renegade rebellion and an unflinching, steel-fisted approach to any embodiment of authority. Pine does well to avoid making Kirk a caricature of William Shatner's interpretation from the sixties without diverting away from the same sense of charisma, charm and initiative integral to his rather iconic screen-presence.<br/><br/>If Star Trek gets its fast-paced sense of power and hard-assed action from Kirk however, it is somewhat ironic then that much of the movie's heart comes from Spock, the pointy-eared, ""heartless"" Vulcan. Conflicted by his Vulcan and Human ancestry which clash at every opportunity between logic and emotion, Spock provides the feature with its most focused source of internal struggle infamously depicted in a few of the TV series' episodes and previous movies. It is this dynamic, coupled with a surprising but perfectly restrained, eloquent and fitting romance subplot that propels Spock beyond Kirk's straight-to-the-point image into a persona that is engulfed by multi-layered moral and interpersonal complexities resulting from emotional confliction.<br/><br/>When all the space-dust has settled however—when the last photons are fired, characters are dealt their hands and lives are altered forever, the overwhelming feeling left in Star Trek's wake is one of hope. Ask any fan from the sixties to the naughties and they will more or likely sum up their love for Star Trek in all its bloated entirety as such; hope for the future. While Abrams' vision here at times tends to go off on darker angles that contradict the safe-play nature of Gene Roddenberry's original, such key themes as hope for a brighter future and a better humanity along tow with an overwhelmingly abundant mass of characterisation and compelling drama allows Star Trek to be Star Trek without feeling as tired as it did just half a decade ago. For some viewers, the now infamous ""Space, the Final Frontier"" monologue that brings this instalment of Star Trek to a close will function as a device for relief that somehow, somewhere there remains a bridge to their beloved Star Trek of yesteryear. Yet for others, this iconic refrain will be given new light when spoken by Leonard Nimoy as the Enterprise readies itself for new worlds and new civilisations—for many it will signal the return of Star Trek as the bold, exciting and culturally relevant form of entertainment that it could once claim to be. Indeed, the Enterprise and its crew are back, and while they may be venturing into dauntingly unexplored territory for the second time—it's been a long time since that closing line rang as true and as resonating as it does today: ""To boldly go, where no one has gone before.""<br/><br/><ul><li>An edited to 1000 words review by Jamie Robert Ward.

"Bmused55","10","1","9","11 May 2009"," A much needed new start
","If you are a Star Trek fan who does not like change this is not a film for you. This film marks what I hope is a new beginning for Star Trek. It takes a well established idea and makes something new of it. This is essentially a complete reboot of Trek. So you have to look at it with that in mind. This film in no way tries to fit in with ""canon"" or established events. The essentials are there, Kirk and crew, the Enterprise, good guys, bad guys and of course red shirts! This film is something anyone can go and see. You only need to have the faintest idea of Star Trek to follow the film. Even then, the film does a good job and introducing you to the characters. The script is first rate, serious when it needs to be and humorous at the right moments to relieve tension. It begins right away with a brilliant opening teaser that will tug at the heart strings of the most hardened moviegoer. The special effects are second to none, although director JJ Abram's over use of lens flare and camera shake is a little annoying. The casting is perfect. The selected cast fill the very big boots handed to them very well. <br/><br/>This film is very much the blockbuster the Star Trek franchise so badly needs."
"Zen416","10","1","9","11 May 2009"," Worth The Price Of Admission
","First of all, you don't have to be a ""trekkie"" or ""trekker"" or whatever they call themselves to enjoy this film; it's like an E-Ticket ride at Disney (as in non-stop action from start to finish). There may have been a few bloopers (I'm not as invested in the series as some folks are so I didn't really spot them) but they're completely forgiven because this movie is just a lot of fun to watch. Chris Pine does the young Jim Kirk character justice, and Zoe Saldana gives the Uhura character a nice bit of spirit. Good turn by Eric Bana as a creepily psychotic Romulan and it's fantastic to see Leonard Nimoy re-creating the role that made him famous: Spock. The whole cast is great and well-picked but the two standouts for me were Zachary Quinto as young Spock (it was easy to forget that this is the same guy who plays an devilish whacko on ""Heroes"" because he plays the hero here so well) and Karl Urban, who does a spot-on impression of Deforest Kelley's lovable grouch Dr. "" Bones"" McCoy. A few nice twists in the story justify how the ending plays out and it's acceptable because it's so well written. Good flick, good time. See it."
"NightwishRaven999","1","1","9","11 May 2009"," A great move for Star Trek
","At first, I was very skeptical about this new movie. We had no idea what to expect. It was pretty clear that if this movie was a failure...Star Trek would die off and end in disgrace.<br/><br/>After Nemesis and the Enterprise series, the future of Star Trek seemed grim. However, this movie was a great ""reboot"" for Star Trek. The movie will attract a new generation to Star Trek and revive the franchise. J.J.Abrahams, managed to keep the Star Trek like we know it, but make it much more appealing to those who are not familiar with the series.<br/><br/>The characters and events are much more relatable to our times then those featured in other Star Treks. The special effect were great, but without being over-blown.<br/><br/>A must see for everyone !"
"rfraser-3","10","1","9","11 May 2009"," How can you NOT like this movie?
","I've seen a few negative reviews here and on the forums regarding this movie from some die hard trekkies/trekors. I want to let other fans and those who are new to trek know that they should give it a try.<br/><br/>I grew up watching the original series reruns and love the original cast, I feel they are the best out of all the trek offerings. I was hesitant upon hearing a that a new movie was coming out rebooting with the original characters but with new actors. I couldn't see Kirk played by anyone but Shatner. I didn't want to see my beloved characters in a failing movie a la Lucas' prequel letdowns.<br/><br/>So now that I've established I'm an absolute die-hard trekkie I will say that I was completely blown away by this movie. I enjoyed every second and if it hadn't been late Sunday night and having to go to work early the next day I would have gotten BACK IN LINE and purchased another ticket to watch it again that night. It has definitely reawoken my inner trekkie and I have fallen in love with this world all over again and can not wait to see what they do next with the story.<br/><br/>I'd say go see it, especially if you are not familiar with the Trek verse, give it a try. Don't let the extreme trekkies who can't accept something new, (i.e. used to argue whether or not warp 13 was possible or violation of canon), detract you from going to see this movie. <br/><br/>Great story, great effects, superb acting. Strap yourselves in..."
"sprockateer","9","1","9","11 May 2009"," Great!
","This was a great movie experience. Kept the characters and their relationships true to the source material, while breaking the cerebral mold that Star Trek had gotten into. Kudos to Abrams and the writers Orci & Kurtzman. Genre R. might just have been very proud of what his ""wagon train to the stars"" had evolved into in the hands of the new directing/writing team. Negative criticism by Trek ""fundementalists"" should be mostly ignored in my opinion. Star Trek has re-invented itself by ingeniously using a legitimate storytelling tool that goes back to the original Sixties series, namely time travel. The new creators have flung off the weighty shackles of previous Trek canon and re-invented itself using one of the main story tenants in that canon. Avid fans need not object, but boldly go where no Trek fan has gone before!"
"aisuru2001","5","1","9","10 May 2009"," Fast-Paced Science Fiction
","This movie is indeed a modern reboot of the Star Trek series. It is so fast-paced that you almost never get a second to calm down. Even when Kirk is lost on a planet, a monster has to appear and chase him. Perhaps it is a sign of age but I enjoyed those movies more that could build suspense without always having to move so fast. I prefer the timing of older Star Trek or Star Wars movies. I am in my early 30s and almost feel old if that's what today's movies should be like.<br/><br/>Acting was good and the story was interesting. However, I do not see why so many Star Trek movies (including this one) must use time-traveling and eternally evil people who want to destroy the universe. It is no longer all that original. But perhaps a more mundane plot would not excite fans as much, I wonder? I do not think that this movie is a masterpiece and neither is it a failure. It is just an average action movie that Star Trek fans and teens and people in their twenties will enjoy. However, this is not a movie for everybody. If you like lot's of explosions and fast-paced action, this is a must see."
"zzoaozz","10","1","9","10 May 2009"," Don't be afraid, it's fantastic
","It was big and beautiful and true to the spirit of the original. Any in-continuities it might have had were explained away in the plot and the presence of Leonard Nimoy was a brilliant move that let us die hard nut case Trekkers accept this new AU and embrace it. The high points- The Enterprise looked like the enterprise, they didn't murder the whole dream by making technology look more advanced in a prequel than it was in the real movie or show like they did with Star Wars. The character playing Bones was spot on, a fitting tribute to the memory and life of Deforrest Kelley. The sheer beauty of the cinematography, CGI, and special effects was breathtaking. If there were any drawbacks they were more than eclipsed by the quality of the film.<br/><br/>It's very hard for non-Trekkers or non-Trekkies to understand our attachment to the dream and the ideal that this TV series became to us. The Next Generation and all its spin off lost something that the original had, the feeling that one man - not a military organization, not a political movement, but one man, a hero - could make right what is wrong. Star Trek was about a hope that the future could be better and brighter than the world we live in, that people can and will learn from their mistakes and do better without destroying the spark that is the human spirit. It's also about believing that we aren't alone out there or in here. Friends will always have our back, there will always be ways to bridge cultural and racial gaps, and there will be other beings out there that share the same hopes and dreams that we do. That's what Trek lost when the original went off the air, but they found it again in this movie.<br/><br/>If you're a TOS Trekker or a real Trekkie, trust me, it's okay, go see it. It won't hurt you, promise."
"chapsdanger","8","1","9","9 May 2009"," Well Done
","Like the majority of J.J. Abram's work, this movie showed vast amounts of characterization and thrilling plot twists. Each of the original characters was played beautifully especially Chris Pine's and Zachary Quinto's portrayal of Kirk and Spock. I won't claim to be a huge Star Trek fan, but I can almost guarantee a true fan will not be disappointed. The only set back I felt was the plot, it was good but at points became confusing. In all, I highly recommend this flick to nerds (like myself), J.J. Abrams fans, and anyone else that wants to be entertained and thrilled by a movie. I give this movie a well deserved 7.5 out of 10, LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!"

","I am a Trekker. I love Star Trek, in all its incarnations, and was excited when I heard that J.J. Abrams was taking on this franchise.<br/><br/>When it was released I was spellbound. Here was a brand new imagining! The crew were all well cast, especially Karl Urban, as 'Bones', and there were 'nods' to previous entries in the Star Trek canon mixed in, too.<br/><br/>However, it just isn't Star Trek.<br/><br/>For a sci-fi movie, aimed at a new audience, it is well worth a watch. But, for Star Trek fans, this movie, while delivering in scope and action, loses out to a story that is filled with plot holes. If more care had been taken with the script, rather than blinding everyone with effects and blowing things up, this could have been so good."
"sklose32","10","1","9","9 May 2009"," Great Star Trek movie for today's audience
","I am a devoted Star Trek Fan since I was like 8 years old. Which is now about 25 years ago. Back then I watched the reruns every summer when I was out of school. <br/><br/>The were the movies.. I was still a bit young.<br/><br/>About the TV Shows: Then at 14 I discovered ""Star Trek:TNG"". I live in Austria and therefor everything on TV is in German. But I had one Satellite channel, SKY 1, back then which broadcast their stuff in English.. Well, so I began watching TNG every day at 9pm.. My English wasn't that great in the beginning but with Star Trek that improved rapidly. Because the Star Trek English is always very clear and understandable. From that grew my love for movies in their original Language. I haven't seen a film dubbed in German for about 15 years now and I am damn proud of that. Well, so I watched TNG. Began collecting the VHS Tapes. 2 Episodes for $35.. I owned (well Still do) all episodes of TNG, DS9 and Voyager on VHS.. You can imagine how much I spent for that. Then came the show ""Enterprise"" which I liked a great deal.. I was dead before it's time sadly..<br/><br/>As for the movies: I never saw the first one as a child or don't remember it. The second one, which is still my favorite I saw many times. The third one was okay but unnecassary.. 4.) Good fun 5.) WTF? 6.) Great reuinion and farewell of the original crew.. Excellent movie 7.) It was an OK movie but felt more like an expensive two parter of the Show.. Too many errors.. Like when Picard sits in his room and Riker enters through the Door that connects his room to the bridge and when Riker enters it's totally dark behind him.. Aside from such minor stuff I enjoyed that movie.. 8.) Man, Frakes made an awesome movie. This one is my 2nd favorite in the series.. It's just great 9.) Did they force Frakes with a Gun to make that movie? 10.) Well, OK movie but for today's audience a little too boring<br/><br/>And now the new movie:<br/><br/>After having seen the trailer I was going in with immense expectations. And they were surpassed. It was such a great movie. It was one of the very few Prequels that actually worked. It explained most things in a logical fashion.. Not like they did in Star Wars where the Force becomes some small organisms that live inside you instead of that spiritual thing we all adored. J.J. really did what had to be done to bring Star Trek across to todays audience. The only thing he might have overdone is that the story and therefor everything that happens hinges to much on improbable coincidences. A little like his show ""Lost"".. But aside from that we get some memorable characters.. Especially Karl Urban as ""Bones"" really captured DeKelly's Essence.. <br/><br/>Also like some people claim according to a bunch of sources this isn't an alternate reality. This is how it always was and always will be. Although Chekov actually comes on board when the Ship is on it's mission for a already a year (See beginning of Season 2 of TOS)<br/><br/>But if you are a SCI-FI Fan or an old Trekkie like me, go and watch the movie!<br/><br/>10/10"
"imdb-9790","9","1","9","8 May 2009"," This is the way to reboot!
","Although the film isn't officially released for another day, there are already nine pages of comments here. Interestingly, the vast majority of the negative ones (all but two) either admit or infer that their authors haven't actually seen the movie. Clearly some people just want to say something to get their monikers out there, even if it's completely irrelevant, meaningless and born of prejudice. That said, I can understand why some hardcore fans didn't like this re-boot.<br/><br/>Let's get my own credentials out of the way. I'm not really a hard-core Trekkie, and although I don't know episode titles of stardates, I used to be prominent in the online fandom and ran a couple of websites. I'm not really all that enamoured of the original crew, although they were a presence in the background as I was growing up.<br/><br/>I've had a problem with the spin off series and some of the movies, especially those presided over by Rick Berman - like a lot of modern science fiction, they got bogged down in the mechanics of the imagined universe with the actors having ever-increasing volumes of techno-babble to spout, and the stories were often about the technology rather than the people. If nothing else, I expected JJ Abrams' involvement to eschew that aspect, and he didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>When I first heard that a Trek ""origins"" movie was planned for this franchise reboot, I feared Star Fleet Academy hormonal teenagers invading the screen. I was ultimately delighted when the story skipped from Kirk enrolling in the Academy to to his (re)taking the Kobayashi Maru scenario we know from The Wrath of Khan, ""Three Years Later"".<br/><br/>The pre-publicity for this movie has stressed more than most that it isn't just for Trekkies but for a mass audience. In that, the makers have succeeded. The plot is really fairly banal and unoriginal - we follow Kirk and Spock growing up with Oedipal issues and like any buddy movie, they dislike each other on first meeting. What a lot of people seem to forget is that the original TV series wasn't just built around them, but included Bones too, as the slightly more world-weary figure who could knock their heads together when needed. And so Dr McCoy gets a fair amount of screen time too. Although only a bit-part in the series, Uhura's role gets expanded as it's always been painfully obvious that she's the only female member of the crew and in this day and age, that just won't do.<br/><br/>The need for a wider appeal is the backbone for the dialogue, offering a structure to hang those character-defining bits you don't need to be a hardcore fan to know about: Spock saying ""Fascinating"", Scotty saying ""I'm giving it all she's got"" (although ""I cannae change the laws of physics"" is only implied); McCoy gets gets an ""I'm a doctor not a ... "" joke, Chekov gets to mispronounce his Vs, Uhura shows her legs, and so on. We even get to have a red-shirt, a character with literally two lines of dialogue who has to get himself killed just to underline that space is a Dangerous Place where Bad Things Happen. And of course there's ""Live Long and Prosper"".<br/><br/>All the actors have the chance to offer their own take on the characters they play rather than being obliged to impersonate their predecessors - this is particularly tricky in Zachary Quinto's case as unlike the others, he has to share the stage with Leonard Nimoy for one scene and their slightly divergent aptitudes are revealed (as well as the fact that, frankly, Quinto is the better actor). Thankfully, Chris Pine doesn't make the slightest move towards Shatner's trademark faltering dialogue delivery but nails the swagger and bravado (and self-congratulatory smirk) every time. Sign of the times, though, Pine gets to do something Shatner never did, and that's to appear in nothing but a pair of baggy y-fronts at one point...<br/><br/>I must mention Karl Urban's Dr McCoy which stops just the right side short of an impersonation (physically, he and DeForrest Kelley have little in common) but keeps all the energy and almost-omnipresent indignation of possibly my favourite character from the series.<br/><br/>My enthusiasm shouldn't hide a few reservations I have. This new Star Trek has more in keeping with the current spate of superhero movies rather than space opera (a genre the original TV series created) in the way it's scripted, shot and also scored. But if James Bond can do it, why can't Trek? And that grated on me just a bit.<br/><br/>On to my main reservation, though. Like most buddy/superhero movies, the main characters start by hating each other and then grow to respect and perhaps even care for each other. But the final act is just a little too rushed for my liking and the Kirk-Spock relationship we know ultimately comes from nowhere, largely by order of future-Spock rather than any real natural character development. And that's a huge pity because it's the core of what the film thinks it's about."
"theonlymovieking","9","1","9","8 May 2009"," Who ever said this film wouldn't please Trekkies?
","If you have heard this you have been lied to! Star Trek has and will always be a favorite among science-fiction enthusiasts; this is a given. This film plays off the old series a lot more than some reviewers may have led you to believe! And, take it from a fan of the series growing up, this movie was amazing in almost every aspect! The story made sense inside of the Star Trek universe. Time travel, not so much a spoiler to this film, is what makes the tables turn in this new film, though we get a new spin on things that make it all-the-more interesting to watch. Every original character is addressed, and aside from the obvious Kirk and Spock, every character we as Trekkies grew up loving has a decent role in the film. 'Bones' as the comic relief, Scotty as the simple yet intuitive chief engineer, Sulu is a little different than we remember but not at all bad, Uhura, and even Checkov gets his time to shine. The story is entertaining, though it drags ever-so-slightly in the middle of the second act. True fans of the series will not be disappointed, and yet I'm sure any avid sci-fi lover, or even an action person, would be impressed with it.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning and are far superior to what we have been exposed to before in the Trek universe. Everything is a little bit more gritty than the lushes 'happy' feeling world we know, and the visuals sort of humanize Trek in a way we have never seen. Great CGI effects (and coming from someone like me who is in no way a fan of CGI unless needed, that's saying a lot). I'm almost sad I couldn't see this on IMAX just for the quality of what you get to see.<br/><br/>The score is phenomenal. Definitely something different, though it will take you easily back to the days of the original series in how the music plays out. Great themes, great low-brass for the villain, Nero, and a great homage to Alexander Courage during the closing credits.<br/><br/>All in all, true fans and ordinary movie-goers will enjoy this film, I hope, as much as I did. I kept a high level of expectation going in, though I also braced myself for the worst. There will be sequels to this film, and when I get the privileged to see them, I hope they keep me entertained like this one did.<br/><br/>What you will get: if you follow the Trek universe, you will get several different references to the show and films. If you don't, these little throw-backs to the time of Shatner and crew are well presented to the point where you can still find them comical/worthwhile. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, and I also want to say if you are a true fan, go expecting the worst, but prepare to be shocked and awed."
"oliver-stevenson","8","1","9","8 May 2009"," Really enjoyable and lots of action
","I was not sure what to expect from this. I have never really been a fan of the series and have never enjoyed the old films. So I would not consider myself a Trek fan. So I went into this film not expecting too much but having seen the trailers was ready to be surprised. And I was. It was a really good, enjoyable, action packed, sometimes funny/tongue in cheek (but not too cheesy) film.<br/><br/>The characters were really well done. Bones and Spock were so similar to the originals you could really appreciate how they were in their younger years compared to the TV series when they appear much older. Except every time I looked at Spock I thought of Sylar from Heros (he has an evil look about him). Simon Pegg was brilliant and very funny. Even Kirk grew on me, rude, arrogant etc. So all in all well done on the cast.<br/><br/>The best bit of the film were the ships and space scenes.<br/><br/>The ships were great with some industrial looking heavy metal, some shiny white sleek ships, lots of lasers and missiles. More like the Star Wars of old I thought.<br/><br/>The camera work with the CGI in the space scenes was much like the scenes from the excellent film Serenity. Looking like they were actually filmed with some shaky cam and out of focus bits. Really dramatic. The cut between the chaos and noise inside the space ships to the total silence, carnage & vastness of the outside shot really adds to the atmosphere. The shot of Enterprise coming out of hyperspace, pulling a hard right turn, all guns blazing while the camera tried to keep up and focus was fantastic.<br/><br/>I am really looking forward to the next instalment. I hope they keep this up."
"lprezdente","9","1","9","8 May 2009"," Lives up to its Legacy
","As a lifelong fan who got hooked on reruns of the original series when I was a kid in the early 70's, I went in excepting to be disappointed. After all, what prequel hasn't been? Not only was it not disappointing, it rises to the highest level of Star Trek at its very best, and is a great science fiction film overall. It has a couple of weak spots and roll your eyes moments, and Winona Ryder looked like she was lost, but otherwise the story and script are surprising strongly, and the cast capably stays true to the originals while also stepping out and expanding the characters to make them their own. In fact, I thought the slowest scenes in the movie were the ones with Leonard Nimoy. Zach Quinto gave such a good performance that he was more believable as Spock than Nimoy was. The visuals are great and the musical score and sound effects (and effective use of silence) are superb. Gene Roddenberry would be proud; this Star Trek completely lives up to and adds to its legacy."
"blackmambamark","9","1","9","7 May 2009"," I cannot even fathom how brilliant this movie is.....
","It all started with ""Batman Begins""......by starting the now common phrase ""Re-boot of a franchise"".......and thus far, its has been proved successful every time. With both Batman and the James Bond series. However, i myself have only seen the first two Star Trek movies, and maybe a few old school episodes. I am not a die hard ""Trekie"", nor do i have a vast knowledge of the creatures, planets, or the history of the crew. I just know the main characters, their purpose, and those ever so classic lines. First off, let me start by saying that the main reason why i went to see this movie, is because of the ever so clever J.J Abrams. Still never heard of him??? Thats a shame, because you eventually will. He has directed the TV series ""Lost"", along with ""Mission Impossible:3"", which totally caught me by surprise. And once again, this man has truly out done himself. This movie was beyond entertaining.......way beyond. It was put together so well, on so many levels that i cannot even fathom. First off, the story.......its premise and plot is so deep and complex, but told so incredibly well. It is not too far out there....and the scenes where it begins to, are immedietly explained so that you never loose track of where you are. The story was utterly brilliant to say the least......because not only does it back up its idea for the re-boot, but it also coincide's with the original......how is that even possible? You will just have to see it to believe it. The second thing that i must talk about is the casting and acting.......my god, i couldn't have dreamed a better cast for this movie. It was damn near perfect......you know what.....it was perfect. The acting and casting was too damn good. Sure there were those classic cheesy one-liners......but they were never overdone, nor were they delivered in an ackward sense.....which really surprised me. You know the feeling you got when you watched all the acting in ""The Dark Knight"".....how everyone just seemed to WOW! you......this movie captures that same aspect. Job well done by everyone.....i wish i could say all of their names, but there are just too damn many.....so i will just say the main two who stood out.......spock and kirk are hands down the best. Bottom Line......coming from a star wars fan, and someone who hardly knows the subject of Star Trek......i am proud to say that this is easily hands down the best movie i have seen so far this year. To tell you the truth, i was expecting to see a pretty good movie, instead i was blown out of my seat. it was entertaining to the max.........everything was done to perfection, and done in perfect doses......from the action, to the dialogue, to the story,and even the acting. This really has everything you are looking for in a movie and more. I am now a fan of the series, and hope to god they make another just like it. So if you are someone who is a little unfamiliar with the series, like myself......i urge you to go and see this movie, because you are a damn fool if you don't. Easily the best of the year so far. I will say this time and time again, J.J. Abrams IS the next Spielberg, because he has not even come close to missing the mark."
"coolandy24","9","1","9","7 May 2009"," Star Trek reborn (Reviewed by a neutral fan)
","I watch star trek movies and TV shows since i'm young and i've never been as much excited to see a franchise reborn with such a good way to do it. This movie delivered almost everything i wanted it to deliver. I think this sequel/prequel is an original new way to reboot a dead franchise. Sorry, but TNG was so boring and uninteresting(except for First Contact which was a good movie).<br/><br/>I'm glad of how thing turned. I was REALLY skeptical about the new crew and the new storyline at first. However, Chris Pine did a really decent job as Kirk, Zachary Quinto surprised me as Spock, Eric Bana was a perfect villain as Nero(lack of screen time though) and all other crew members(Karl Urban as McCoy, Simon Pegg as Scottie, etc..) were brilliantly cast.<br/><br/>First thing i liked about this movie was how Abrams makes us revisit Star Trek without passing too much time to reexplain things we already know and how he connects this movie to the whole franchise without forgetting other movies. Sorry for people who hated it, but i think it was the best way to do it, because people don't want to forget old movies and start from a new point. They want to see the same heroes from another generation continuing the adventures of the crew.<br/><br/>Star Trek is not perfect. It's full of cheesy lines and maybe some humor where we don't need it, but i don't think it removes anything from the movie. I would have like to see more from Nero(Eric Bana).<br/><br/>Technically, Star Trek is a jewel. Visual effects were stunning, sets were top notch and action was spectacular.<br/><br/>To every Trekkers in the galaxy, just go see it with an open mind. They did an amazing job without killing the franchise and made it more accessible for people who never watch star trek before. This movie makes every other ST movie stronger by adding a younger touch to the franchise."
"sapphirenut","8","1","9","7 May 2009"," Reinvention of the wheel unnecessary, but changing a flat is
","Marketing a really good movie these days takes some creative genius and though up until this point I have not been overly impressed with JJ Abrams (I hated Cloverfield - go ahead and shoot me), Star Trek was outstanding.<br/><br/>Being a child of the early 70's, I was familiar with the original Star Trek from way back. I am sure the original was off the air before I had access to television, but I did watch every single episode of the re-airing, as well as every movie (ad nauseum I might add) and even to the point that I can claim to be nearly a Trekkie (though not quite, never been to a convention).<br/><br/>Honestly, JJ Abrams reinvented this classic in my opinion. He totally destroyed any concept of the original story line, but stayed true to form with time travel, odd alien life-forms (including the lovely green seductress and a very young James Kirk). I do think they might've chosen a better model for the young Spock than the well known villain from Heroes, but hey, he pulled it off wonderfully.<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVED seeing Leonard Nemoy! I wasn't actually all that surprised, but at the same time was because this was not Gene Roddenberry's work. As ALWAYS he gave a charming and epic performance as the aging Spock from the future, and JJ Abrams even let him have the character (more true to form with what one would surmise from half Vulcan/half human). I was pleased with the storyline on the whole - except....<br/><br/>The one flaw with movies these days is the cliffhanger. It seems we are left with our popcorn in our hands wondering ""is that it"" at the end of the blockbusters these days. This one is no exception. I want to know now how they are going to satisfy us. Will there be a series? If so, they will have to COMPLETELY re-make Star Trek into a new image, because they have to rebuild the entire Vulcan society (since the entire planet was demolished), but here's my question, now that the young Spock is aware that his error in judgment is what caused the calamity in the first place, with the entire Romulan population being obliterated (except for that dreadful Nero who comes back to torture everyone), will he make the same mistake again in this new time line they have created? If he does not make that same mistake, and Romulus is somehow NOT destroyed, then there will be no Nero to come back and kill Kirk the elder, and Spock will not return in the AWESOME Vulcan ship....and....uh, oh dear, I've gone all cross-eyed.<br/><br/>I was hoping that when the Enterprise stared at the Romulan vessel being totally annihilated in the black hole, that out the other side we would see an alternate reality, one where the elder (not yet captain) Kirk is sitting on the deck of the the ship, before the captain went over to Nero's ship and before the crew ejected. On that side, Nero's ship collides with ""itself"" (the one that was emerging from the black hole fixing to destroy the other vessel), is completely demolished, and the young Kirk peers across the black hole at his father, who will now live to come back to Earth, be reunited with his wife and baby, and thus set into motion the correct time-string, where Vulcan is not destroyed, and everything returns to the normal story as we know it.<br/><br/>Now that would have made a fine ending, I think.<br/><br/>How else are they going to explain Scotty's advanced knowledge of teleportation, and so on and so forth? Plus, we have Spock the elder now back on Earth to rebuild Vulcan with some serious knowledge in his noggin! Lord this is confusing.<br/><br/>On the whole, I loved the movie and it has done to me exactly what JJ Abrams intended, awakened my love for Star Trek."

","The plot will be repeatedly rehashed, so I'll skip straight to my take on it.<br/><br/>This reboot certainly takes a respectfully clear path of the original series - while still reprising the original characters. It's quite a tightrope to walk but Director JJ Abrams has done it.<br/><br/>Non-Trek Fans: It's so much better than you expect.<br/><br/>And Die-Hard Trekkies: Abrams actually did you proud, with a newness that gives the original a really fresh approach.<br/><br/>Lots of fun, lots of visual and a pretty snappy script. Much better than the summer films we'll see. Don't put it in the ""Made only to sell toys"" category.

","I am 40 years old. Which means I have been watching Star Trek since before I can remember. My Mom says I used to watch it during the last days of it's original run on NBC. I have to take her word for it because I was less than a year old,( she also tells me I watched first moon landing but of course I don't remember that either), but I do remember the early days of syndication in the early 70's. In my area it was only on Sun. night at 11:30p.m. past my bedtime,(we didn't have cable T.V. available in our neighborhood yet), so I only saw it during school breaks, summer vacation and such. I would sometimes catch it when visiting my brother's house, he had cable T.V. and you could see Star Trek more than once a week. I was hooked! It was a thing of wonderment for a 6 year old. It was before Star Wars. It looked like nothing else on T.V., or at the movies. I had the action figures and the Enterprise play set with the spinning transporter. I watched the same episodes over and over. Then in 1979 here came Star Trek: The motion Picture. The first ST movie,( my mom took me to see it ), was slow and long but I loved it, because it was new ""Trek"". Wrath of Khan breathed new life into the franchise and you know the rest of the story. The ""Next Generation"" came along and I have to admit I didn't like it at first, but quickly grew to love the characters as much as the old crew. The next 3 series and 8 movies were just as fantastic. However they didn't make me feel like I was 6 years old again. This new movie did! This new incarnation is so fresh and original, without losing the feel of the original show, that I am at a loss of words to describe it. If you haven't seen it GO SEE IT!! See it on the big screen. Get yourself a big popcorn and a big soda (you won't want to miss anything while you go for refills) and enjoy! I won't get into the technical or casting aspects of the film or parts of the plot that are a bit of a stretch as others on here have said enough about that, but this film is the best time to be had in a movie theater in along time."

I've known and met some people that have seen this movie more than 5 times, me only 2 then I'll buy it when it comes to Blu-ray. This movie has the action, the characters, the special effects! I really think I'd watch this movie over Transformers 2. They did an excellent job with the characters and sticking to the original. Made it fun to watch and entertaining to see new people pulling off old lines. My favorite was the Doc, he was great! All of the new people did an excellent job I think. If they made another one with the same cast I would go see it, I just hope it would be as good as the first. And not turn into a Transformers 2."

","I went to see the Star Trek movie on Saturday... spellbinding stuff. All the hype that I had endured while trying to keep my unbiased attitude coming up to this film was quite well-supported... the folks at Bad Robot show that they sure know how to craft a good story with this one.<br/><br/>Brilliantly paced, with spectacular action sequences and a cast so eloquently skilled that they border on real-life. The two-hour roller-coaster ride never gets the wobbles, always pounding on at full throttle, blending the modern and the classic, blending contraries into one melting pot of pure goodness. But enough of my sensationalism, this film is GOOD. From one that has not followed the original series or the string of movies that followed up to this, I found myself surprisingly involved in the story, and not left behind by jargon or subplots that so cleverly constitute possibly the most clever prequel ever made.<br/><br/>Star Trek achieves the near impossible, in that it is so Star-buffickly correct in every way (or at least from what I garnered), yet still satisfying the critical needs of an ignorant buffoon as I who has no idea of the intricacies and sub-plots and conflicts involved in what has become a quasi-cult. However, there were points where I was left wondering how much they were building on the characters, and whether they were trying to develop their personas or rather establish the already known. As if no ground was covered, as if this was another journey in the grand space of things (no pun intended), however this could have been a merit in itself.<br/><br/>Overall, this film succeeded so much as it did for the sheer fact that the humor was exquisite, the characters 3-dimensional and believable, and the family elements that were evident through its apparent lack of violence even shown through morals and touching elements that are so lacking in today's film niche, and therefore it is worth seeing, I put all my chips down on this one. Solid effort. 8/10."
"ste_shmoobert","10","1","10","25 June 2009"," Reboot me Scotty!
","As a self-confessed fan of the Star Trek TV shows I knew I would enjoy this film but didn't expect to be so thrilled and entertained that I would be floating out of the cinema. A very important trait for any film-maker is to produce a movie with a detailed story and bursts of information within a two hour period as J.J. Abrhams manages to accomplish. As for the cast I would say it was an amazing group effort. Chris Pine's 'Kirk' was the most pleasing of them all but was not standing out there alone. I would hold Karl Urban's performance as 'Bones' and Simon Pegg as 'Scotty' in high esteem, they brought the same warmth to the characters as their predecessors if not more. The action is not over-done and the plot was very cleverly constructed. Finally, you do not have to be a die hard Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie, in fact be warned, you may just find yourself watching an episode or two of the classic TV series as I believe it will return an interest to the show. Watch it!"
"The_Orenda","6","1","10","24 June 2009"," A successful reboot.
","I remember in 2003 a survey in TV Guide. One of the questions was 'Is Star Trek dead?' 84% responded 'Yes.' I can tell you six years ago, I would not have thought of rebooting the franchise through recasting the original crew and providing the scapegoat that The Original Series is an alternate reality to the one we know now. And thank God, it worked. Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman have successfully revived a dead franchise, one I watched my whole sad life bringing youth, personality and a better vision of what it would be like traveling through space. I liked it. The movie as is though, does not hold up. Poor Eric Bana, not doing much of anything since Brad Pitt slaughtered him in Troy, is stuck with the tiring vengeful character that crippled the Star Trek universe in the first place (Shinzon in Nemesis, Ru' afo in Insurrection and Soran in Generations), reduced to el-lame-o lines such as 'Fire everything!' and 'I'd rather watch my world die a thousand times than give up to you,' or something or other. Next you unnecessarily pair up Scotty with a midget alien sidekick. Couldn't you at least give the poor guy a lady friend? And my last complaint is portraying an Orion girl, known for seduction, as a ditz of the highest order? *sigh* I'm done. I look forward to the next film. This could be the start of something great."

Thought the original just dated and not for me. It was his birthday week, and I went for him and I thought it was awesome. Now I can't stop watching the old episodes with him. What a fun movie. After the old Spock guy showed up, my dad was waiting for the old Captain Kirk guy to show up. On the way home he said it was probably right not to have him in that one, but maybe he'll do a cameo in the sequel. It's funny, my dad just left the theater and he was talking about a sequel. Just the same, my dad and I have now developed this new kinship that we haven't had in years. Talk about combining the old with the new.

","I'm not a startrek fan. In fact I've never seen the 60's series or their motion pictures. I've seen only a couple of chapters of the animated series and Generetions. So I'm not concern or interested in the Trekkie Phenomenon.<br/><br/>These movie was great, because behind the action and visual effects scenes, it's a movie about family values. All the plot involves family matters, parents that tries to save their children, and sons that tries to save their parents. Also the responsibility of the Captain the father of the starship, and the nexus of the crew with their Captain. Even the main Villain Nero (Eric Bana), porpouses is to revange his own family. There is also two short but memorable, mother and son relationship. A theme that American Cinema most of the time forget. The lovely relationship of lost between mother (an always Shiny Winona Ryder despite the horrible makeover) and son (Zachary Quinto). Also the movie has lot of fan, thanks to the comedies abbilities from part of the cast. Anton Yelchin, who was the funny teen of Indie movie, is histerically funny with his accent, or Simmon Pegg who is a comedian of the mayor ligues. and Chris Pine as Kirk is the main revelation. Pine has a couple of too light movies in his curriculum, so this movie, will make him an star. It's funny,wild and has the right amount of film precense to be the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. The other big surprise of the movie is Karl Urban, who is brilliant as the frighten to fly, doctor divorced, and acts as Kirk Pal and old bro. The only underused character is Zulu, but he has his scene and probably in the next sequel his participation should be better. Zoe Saldana as Uhura is great, is beauty and sexy, the only bad thing is that her participation start to decline in the movies second half.<br/><br/>To sum up, Startrek is a a great movie for all the family for the lovely values -among the action, comedy and v.e- that the world needs."
"marcusdean118","9","1","10","11 June 2009"," A good romp.
","Star Trek for the Star Wars era. Out with the campness and scientific language. In with the one liners and special effects. This is not entirely a bad thing, being raised very much in the resurgence of the Star Wars prequels I have been fed by stunning set pieces held together with humour. Looking to the obviously superior original Star Wars trilogy, I saw the formula in which the new films were based. But looking back, not as a huge fan of sci-fi, the Star Trek series always seemed a bridge too far With this modern reboot courtesy of JJ. Abrams, both sets of fans are kept relatively happy. There are constant nods to the series (""Set phasers to stun"" and even ol' Nimoy) as well as the younger generation humour (""I may be sick on you"" and Simon Peggs green little helper).<br/><br/>The acting line up is an impressive mix of established talent and up and coming stars. Chris Pine wobbles a bit as Kirk, he pulls off the comedy with ease but struggles in maintaining his attitude and powerful status as the ships future captain. Zoe Saldana, Anton Yelchin and John Cho all do fine in their small roles as Uhura, Chekov and Sulu respectively.<br/><br/>Eric Bana grits his way through as the films villain, with his supposed accent getting the best of him, moving from a thick eastern European accent to a clean cut American for no meaningful reason, disappointing from the films most bankable and talented actor. Simon Pegg displays an atrocious accent in his role as Scotty, showing he should either fire his agent for assuring him he could do the role justice or his voice coach for assuring him his Scottish accent was even passable. It's in Karl Urban's Bones and Zachary Quinto's Spock in which the acting is displayed best. Bones being typified expertly with grisly attitude and a deep voice. And Quintos Spock acts from his eyes which move around intently throughout the film allowing the rest of his body to follow suit and turn in a moviestar performance.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, its actions sequences intense. But it lacked the cutting edge of an out and out story. It struggles in deciding whether to be a hero and villain film or just an origins story. So it does both.<br/><br/>The films a jack of all trades, but sadly master of none. Commendable though."

"scottesavage","10","1","10","28 May 2009"," Star Trek - the kind of movie we need
","Funny, isn't it? That a movie that reignites a science-fiction phenomenon from the era of Jimi Hendrix and Berkley's bra burnings could be exactly what our nation needs in this moment from a movie.<br/><br/>Star Trek is a move about hope amidst a time that is in desperate need of hope. A movie that tells us that what we do matters. A movie asks us if we are satisfied with our life, leaving us wondering what kind of life we were called and created to live. As movies like The Kingdom, Syriana, and Body of Lies seek to paint our present world (and flirt with a little too-real portrayal of that which scares, terrifies, and raises difficult memories), Star Trek moves down a different path. <br/><br/>The movie was funny. In both of my views, I found myself around people who were talking to each other, laughing together, and giving commentary about how great the film was (and how the casting was spot on). While the background is space, the director found a way to highlight the film's brightness, not its darkness. <br/><br/>The genre of science fiction and fantasy becomes accessible in this film. There are two kinds of people who will walk into theaters to see this film. The first group knows the original show, its characters and their nuances. The second group is uninformed. However, it was my experience that members of both groups connected with characters like Chekov, Sulu, Uhura, Spock, Bones and Kirk. And Simon Pegg's take on Montgomery Scott earned the most laughs and seemed the perfect balance of new twists, in the spirit of the original. These characters have rough edges; they are imperfect with weaknesses and flaws. Yet, their rough edges do not drive the viewer away; instead, they become winsome and attractive features that connect the viewers to the film. Star Trek was teaching diversity and tolerance before it became en vogue (a Russian character during the Cold War, a black woman during the Civil Rights movement, etc.). <br/><br/>While the story was very plausible and credible from a voyeuristic perspective, the real strength of this film was its characters. Even as the action-packed plot of this J.J. Abrams film partly followed in the path of films like Armageddon and Mission Impossible 3, intense dialogue scenes moved the development of the characters and plot forward here. The development of these characters and their interaction with each other is the driving force of the film. We find so much of ourselves, our dreams and fears, and our time in these men and women. We wonder with Pike about Kirk's future and if he was wasting his life screwing around in Iowa. We feel caught in between Spock's emotional brokenness manifested in fear of pursuing Nemo and Kirk's reckless we-can't-lost desire to pursue him.<br/><br/>While critics often find something about a film to harp on, this film had me falling head-over-heels and when the credits rolled, I looked at my wife and said, ""It's already over?! I could have gone for another two hours."""

Then in 1979 they made the first ever star trek the motion picture a little confusing to my nine year old brain but it was entertaining it had Kirk Spock Mccoy and the rest and I loved it and all the other Trek films that followed. Then came Star Trek GENERATIONS. They killed off Captain James T. Kirk in that one and some of the magic died for me at least. The next generation films while good and enjoyable were forgotten after leaving the theater. Then Came Star Trek 2009 a massive reboot or a incredible revamping of the original series. I saw it and loved it . It brought back the magic of the original for me yes their are differences Spock and Uhura dating Vulcan meeting it's fate and James T.Kirk aboard the Enterprise but not as a captain not even as a crewman. JJ Abrams takes the Trek story and runs in different directions with it and has fun making this film and it shows. The Cast has fun and it shows this film has a heart and it has the imagination to create a newer beginning for a newer Trek generation this is not your father's Star Trek it's Yours make of that what you will. Chris Pine creates a rebel James T. Kirk at war with the universe and trying to prove himself. Spock is the half breed trying to overcompansate for the weaker human blood in his DNA makeup until he realizes That it makes all the difference and it makes him Better. Mccoy is the Country Docter caught up in Kirk's Whirlwind life and becomes his best friend and later on Spock's best friend as well. Mccoy sees things from a different perspective and is able to comment on it. This movie has so much going for it so much Action so much character development so much comedy and again so much imagination in telling a complicated story But not making it overly complicated that the audience can follow along. in my theater the audience gave this film a standing ovation. This movie gives us a new course to set on and a universe of newer stories to tell.

S. S. Enterprise crew and how their paths conjoin and interact for the first time, to become what they are and who they are. What this instalment has going for itself is longevity, longevity to continue as the new phase, the new and bold frontier to perpetuate its myth and vitality. Star Trek has truly arrived in the 21st Century. And what an entrance.<br/><br/>While at the fork in the road, the point being, here, you do not have to be a follower of the Star Trek franchise to enjoy this feature film, taking it as the next step in its evolution or taking it independently as a splendid sci-fi movie, or in fact, both, is the appeal of this fresh and epic journey. As a ""Star Trek"" film its green-shoots, in time, will, no doubt, develop into what we have become accustomed to, or shall it? Does it need to? Shall we see the old characteristics coming to maturity? Or, shall we see a completely new direction to these space adventurers'? Time and space will be the better judge to these begging questions, but travelling down the second road, of a film of the science fiction genre, it is riveting stuff, and it is exactly what the Big Screen was created for.<br/><br/>Visually, it is extremely captivating and exciting movie watching. The tone is both friendly, humorous, fun and intriguing, a curiosity in which direction the roads shall take, but, deep down, we all know the outcome, as it is quick with pace as it is a stunning work of visual delight and excellence. Maximum science fiction eye candy that transcends both franchise and audience to greater expectations without a fault in its delivery or character analyses. This is action over philosophical thought, grunt over intellect, this is 21st century action hero space travel.<br/><br/>We, or more to the point, film and cinema, have come a long way since the old exploration days of Georges Méliès's Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon - 1902) and René Clair's Paris qui dort (At 3:25 - 1925). We are grateful to these innovators' of both film and science fiction, and too, to the great 1956 epic Forbidden Planet, all who have helped mould and create the shape of things that have come and what shall be. As too, it is J.J. Abrams's step into the unknown that is the 21st century Star Trek that too takes a bow and for this bold attempt and right step forward to continue at the helm of, possibly, the most famous spacecraft in science fiction history."

","Director JJ Abrams is not the obvious choice to make a success of this film. Steeped in the episodic nature of TV serial ""Lost"" and with ""Cloverfield"" a divisive project, handing $150m dollars to him was a risk. But the risk has paid off triumphantly.He has produced an exciting reinvention of the original to set the scene for how it all began.<br/><br/>For aficionados, the characters are faithfully represented, yet with the twist that their younger persona's can be explored. Thus a young rebellious, hot headed Kirk is brilliantly played out by Chris Pine,and the ""sex on legs"" Uhuru is sassily strutted by Zoe Saldana.It is easy to forget that her part was the first mainstream, principal female black character seen on American TV.<br/><br/>Improbably, the Studios paid as much attention to the plot as to the special effects. Consequently we are given a visual feast as a backdrop for a coherent, believable well executed story. Divulging too much plot may spoil things for the uninitiated, suffice to say it has a pleasant surprise and Star trek traditions are maintained.Unusually there are also a few "" laugh out loud"" jokes.<br/><br/>A treat for old fans, and wholly digestible for the uninitiated, a sequel at least is both guaranteed, and deserved."

","The writing in this film is fantastic. Though some standard science fiction plot devices are used, what they say about this film is true. It can appeal to Trekies and non-Trekies alike, even though being one does help you understand the nuances of the characters, especially Kirk and Spock. The main accomplishment of the writers is their simplicity. Sure, the plot may look familiar, but it is fluidly and BELIEVABLY executed. Keeping Trekkie-level complexity out of the plot not only expands the viewer base, but also allowed the writers to focus on delightfully placed humor and character development that is consistent in the eyes of Trekies, and intriguing in the eyes of newcomers.<br/><br/>This is what kept the film from being the disaster the pessimists and purists may have believed it to be when it was first in production. JJ Abrams has my respect. He brought in a cast that all did a splendid job capturing the essence of the 1960's, but also acknowledged the needs and wants of twenty-first century audiences. It was EXTREMELY bold melding Spock's Vulcan and human aspects, but he found the right balance and that was important for both creating and maintaining the hold on both demographics of viewers. That's the new century twist needed in movie making these days. Surprise the old dogs, excite the new!<br/><br/>There are small holes and unnecessary elements of the storyline, but the beautiful thing about EVEN the flaws is that the Trekies will naturally forgive some, and general audiences will forgive the others because they are flaws both sides are respectively accustomed to seeing. You will know these when you see them.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is phenomenal film making and I hope we see more! Let's just hope once they get past their peak, they will recognize it and stop!"

","In this captivating origins story about James Kirk and the Enterprise crew, J.J. Abrams expertly dodges the issue of overfamiliarity and delivers a tight, action-packed, eminently thrilling tale.<br/><br/>I expected a lot out of this movie, and to tell the truth I found the trailers and previews pretty mediocre. Nothing about them made me really want to see the film; it was as if the trailers were trying to manage the expectations of the intended audience. But here's the rub: Chris Pine, who plays Kirk, is a lot better than I thought he'd be - not a caricature of William Shatner, just a precursor to him, much like Ewan McGregor in Star Wars Episode 1, but with more subtlety.<br/><br/>Kirk is introduced to us at his actual birth, moments after his father - very temporarily a Starfleet captain - sacrifices himself so that his entire crew, including his wife and newborn, may survive. Later events in the whiz kid's life inform his later character, the charm, intelligence, and dare taking that we all expect from James Tiberius Kirk.<br/><br/>Kirk meets Spock, played by Zachary Quinto, at the Academy, where the latter designs the simulation that all prospective cadets must engage. The two lock horns when Kirk manages to defeat the simulation by rather unorthodox means, and that would typically be it for our young hero, but a sudden threat has been detected at the planet Vulcan, and all of the cadets, even Kirk, are quickly dispatched.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the two main characters - we're talking Spock and Kirk here - must somehow evolve as, well, people, much as they did throughout the original series' run. Kirk, at the outset, is very emotional, despite supreme intelligence. Spock shows no emotional at all, suppressing his Earth half almost completely. Each, however, is completely certain that his own method is the only way to go, and their eventual compromise, brought upon by tragic circumstances, allows the Enterprise story as we know it to fully coalesce.<br/><br/>Ah, you ask, if this is a reboot - hence the lack of numerals after the title - does that mean that the TV series and the movies should all be forgotten? Not so fast, my friend, not so fast! A useful little sci-fi writers' crutch known as time travel will solve everything. I'm being a little facetious, of course; this marks the third time in the eleven Star Trek films that time travel has been used, but it's not overused yet, and here it not only is a fun writers' tool but a genuinely creative way to show the past (the old films) while allowing future films to coexist.<br/><br/>To sum up: In the future, old Spock tries to prevent a supernova from destroying Romulus, but he fails; a renegade Romulan general (played here by Eric Bana) blames Spock, and both he and Spock wind up going through a black hole that takes them a century into the past. Now the Romulan is trying to destroy young Spock before he can get old and not save Romulus.<br/><br/>Abrahms' pacing is stellar, pardon the pun. There's hardly any letup with the action, and when it does we get poignant, well-acted scenes of reserved anger (Spock) or pensive musings (Kirk). There's only one love scene, and it's a quickie (again pardon the pun - not intended).<br/><br/>The supporting cast was well picked, too. John Cho (Sulu), Anton Yelchin (Chekov), Karl Urban (Bones), Eric Bana (the Romulan, Nero), Ben Cross (Spock's dad), and even Winona Ryder as Spock's mother are perfect fits, eschewing scenery chewing for thoughtful, imaginative performances.<br/><br/>A couple of other actors deserve special mention. Zoe Saldana plays Uhura, the beautiful communications officer on the Enterprise. Uhura has wildly different relationships with Spock and Kirk, and Saldana is well up to the task: a strong, intelligent, and relentlessly caring young woman (although, interestingly enough, not the only woman on the Enterprise's bridge). Then there's the cherubic Simon Pegg as Engineer Scotty; Scotty, unlike most of the other main characters, finds himself on the ship almost by accident, but his beaming ability saves the crew's bacon. Pegg's upbeat exuberance is catchy.<br/><br/>This isn't just another pretty-people-in-space action movie. For once, although everyone is quite young (too young?) and attractive, there's quite a bit of substance behind each character. And remember, the movie could have the scourge of familiarity working against it as well; there's always the risk that it won't meet our high expectations of how the characters should behave. Not the case here. Star Trek is gleeful fun, managing to embrace the old while opening the door to adventures anew."
"cabaniss-2","9","1","10","7 May 2009"," A much needed reboot of the franchise!
","Being a confirmed Trekker who can remember watching the original series the first time around and who can spot non-canon fodder from a parsec away, I went into the cinema more than a little skeptical after having watched all the trailers until I could quote the entire sequence of each one. In the past, I have been almost disenfranchised by the revisionists who scripted First Contact. So I expected some more of the same with this movie. Wow! Was I ever surprised! What J.J. Abrams did was simply awesome! From the opening scenes, he has given the Star Trek Franchise a much needed reboot. Let's face it, Star Trek had just about run it's course and was running out of steam. To continue on and remain in canon was getting quite hard for the writers. Just look at First Contact for instance, where they relocated Zefram Cochrane from Alpha Centauri to Earth. Now, by going back to the roots of Star Trek and introducing an old (old at least by Star Trek standards) plot twist, we see new life breathed into our Star Trek universe! Thanks to the genius of this new twist, we can start again with familiar characters, but with a whole new universe and a different beginning, setting down new canon that doesn't have to be in conflict with the old canon.<br/><br/>My only concern is that with this fresh new beginning that the guardians of the Star Trek franchise stay away from the inconsistencies that was getting harder and harder to deal with in the older Star Trek universe. It is unfortunate that they overlooked a big one in this movie: no military or paramilitary service such as Star Fleet would promote straight out of their Academy a cadet, no matter how promising, straight into the captaincy of the flagship of the fleet! Shame on you, Mr. Abrams. You should have known better than this. Not only that, but you have just robbed us of the opportunity of seeing young Mr. Kirk grow and develop even further as he worked his way up the chain of command.<br/><br/>I would like to see in the coming sequels major development of the relationship between Spock and Uhura. I always thought it was sad that Spock never got to have a serious romance. Here is a great chance for Star Trek to once again make some of that social comment that some people think is missing in today's Star Trek, by exploring interracial relationships. In this case, with Zoe Saldana, who is a black woman and human, and Spock, who is white and an alien, it can become a two-edged sword! I would also like to see more screen time for McCoy in the future. Karl Urban rocks as the new McCoy! Chekov and Sulu should receive more attention and chances for career advancement in the coming sequels in the same way we saw Data and La Forge develop in character and advance in rank over time. And get Scotty out of that damned chemical factory and into a proper Engineering Section."
"NikTesla","8","1","10","7 May 2009"," Interesting, as Spock would say
","Overall I felt satisfied with this movie. J.J Abrams has bought out a very worthwhile movie and completely blown the ""Odd number bad, even number good"" Star Trek myth completely out of the water in the process.<br/><br/>There were some nice nods to the original series but the movie did not feel constrained by that. There were some nice inside jokes. The cinematography was, by and large very good. I liked the way J.J. moved the camera around. And the special effects were very good without overpowering the story.<br/><br/>Mostly the cast were well selected. Pine's version of Kirk had a lot of similarities to Shatner's Kirk, but he was not a slave to that version of the role. Karl Urban (yay Kiwis! :)) does a great Bones, even getting the same vocal infections that DeForest Kelley used. Zoe Saldana's Uhura is very good as well. Zachary Quinto is very believable as a still maturing and evolving Spock.<br/><br/>But there were, in my mind, a couple of things that did not work well. Simon Peg missed with his portrayal of Scotty. While I was not expecting another James Doohan, there were certain elements of Scotty that I felt should have been there that just weren't. Also there was too much of that damned annoying camera shake in an otherwise static shot. It's overdone and outdated. Knock it off! Other that that I would say it was well worth the money."
"davideo-2","9","1","12","7 July 2009"," A dream come true for big fans, but will satisfy none fans just as well
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Not being an obsessive fan of the original series/films, I can't go into a massive rant about how faithful/unfaithful this new film has been to Gene Roddenberry's original vision. The whole point of it in the first place was to revamp and relaunch it for a new generation (many of whom, of course, weren't even around when it first came out.) And so director JJ Abrams has given us his new vision of the series, and actually appears to have both kept the spirit and tone of the original series alive, whilst also giving the first film in the new series an edginess and vitality that may have been lacking first time around.<br/><br/>The considerable length is matched out by a lively cast list to match the institution the original stamped. Each of the new actors brings their new roles to life with that bit more edge, from Chris Pine's wise cracking, smart arsey but fearless Kirk, to Zachary Quinto's brilliantly nerdish, unfeeling Spock (with Leonard Nimoy popping up as him in the future!) Likewise, supporting players Bruce Greenwood, as kidnapped Commander Pike and Eric Bana as the villainous Romulan Nero, give added gusto in their respective intrepid good guy/ruthless bad guy roles. Plus there's Ben Cross, instantly recognizable as Spock's dad and Simon Pegg clearly having a great time as a less chubby Scott. Winona Ryder was also in it, but I must say I didn't recognize her...<br/><br/>The opening takes it's time to grow on you, with not the most interesting dialogue or snazzy writing (which doesn't improve much further into it, really), but stick with it and as the film's considerable length waves on, it will slowly absorb you, drawing you more into the story as it goes on, with, as expected, some fantastic special effects and costume design. Should just about appeal to 'trekkies' and non trekkies alike. ****"

","I was a fan of star trek when I was a teenager, but haven't watched it for years. I did catch the previous star trek movie (resurrection??) on TV, and was surprised that I actually watched this crap when I was little. I was somewhat reluctant to see this movie, but I am glad I did. Its an entertaining movie, great plot, excellent visual effects. The first half of the movie seems a bit better then the second half. The second half seems kinda odd. The ending battle just seems out of place. And another thing...what is up with shooting scenes with the top portions of the heads cut off?? Was I the only one who noticed it? The shots of faces seem to end at the eyes, and the forehead and hair are cutoff. I guess it was done on purpose, but its annoying. If the close ups scenes are like the exclamation points, then ""Do you really need that many exclamation points""? Comparing to the previous star trek movies, this is a masterpiece. Its an entertaining movie even for non Trekkie's. I am expecting either a second movie or a new TV series within a couple of years."
"oscar-35","Null","1","12","15 June 2009"," Enjoyable
","I saw and enjoyed Star Trek XI, in IMAX. It was well worth the couple of extra dollars. The film should be well received as shown in regular theaters. The IMAX screen is huge and the sound system is monstrous, both enjoyable with this film.<br/><br/>1. The opening scenes are grabbers and explain Kirk's family background in a exciting starship battle.<br/><br/>2. The new young cast has been very impressive to see how they brought the exact TOS roles to this film's new time frame.<br/><br/>3. CGI was NOT a scenes stealer or overused.<br/><br/>4. For myself, I was glad to see that many filming locations were in the SoCal area so filming helped the local sagging movie economy. Some of those spots were CSUN, Kernville, Tustin, Van Nuys and more.<br/><br/>5. You don't have to me a hardcore fan to enjoy this film. Hardcore fans might have a problem with some of the plot explanations of long misunderstood Trek 'canon' assumptions the fans have developed for themselves. But those explanations are plausible and fit the plot story line nicely.<br/><br/>6. The film was dedicated to Majel and Gene Roddenberry."
"Dunharrow","9","1","12","14 June 2009"," Star Trek fans should be proud
","Sure, it's different. But I thought the original cast had done great, and could not have done more. <br/><br/>However, were we really ready for it to end? This 'reboot' gives new life to the characters we love. Gives us a new look at them. Could we really ever imagine anyone else playing Kirk? No, but Chris Pine doesn't play the old Kirk, he plays a new and different Kirk. Which do I like better? Well, I suppose I'll stick to the McGill grad, but Pine was great in his role. He played the edgier crazier Kirk to perfection. Star Trek fans should be very pleased with this film, and the actors who made it great. I thought that Karl Urban was great as Bones, and that Zoe Saldana was amazing as Uhura.<br/><br/>The toughest sell for me was Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock. I thought he was great, but I am unused to such a young and emotional Spock. His brashness seems unfitting for the wise demeanor Nimoy always brought (and still brings in this installment). I hope that the sequel will come with a tamer Spock. <br/><br/>So, in the end, be proud that your cherished franchise is still enjoyed by millions. Different look, different characters (personality-wise) and a different kind of film, but it is entertaining and enjoying. The new actors aren't filling shoes, they're making new ones. And boy are they sweet."

","Well, I've read some of the comments and it seems that most of the negative review is from Trekkies/ Trekkers or whoever they claim to be.<br/><br/>C'mon guys give it a break. Its a great film. You're bashing it not because of it story/cast/acting or effects, you're bashing it cos it alters the timeline, cos you think it has destroyed everything that you hold dear. (... how can characters and stories of TNG, DS9, Voyager exists if the timeline has already been altered?) Does it really matter? I don't intend to insult anyone. I also like those series. I'm too young to even catch the reruns of original Star Trek but I'm old enough and enjoyed TNG, DS9 and voyager very well. For me those characters and stories will always be in my heart.<br/><br/>There are some people who said that JJ and his co. have murdered Star Trek. To me, they've brilliantly resurrected and powered-up a dying franchise. I would rather see my favourite franchise living long and prospering, rather then slowing dying to its demise. I mean ask everyone would they like to see another Star Wars sequel, after the bad taste left by the Episode 3 and the Clone Wars? Trust me I'm a Sci-Fi fan and I like all the three original Star Wars very much (I can watch them again anytime), but after those two, I don't want another Star Wars movie. But Star Trek, man I can't wait for another now. That's how this movie will make you feel.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, you cannot help but be filled with hopeful, optimistic vision of the future (we're even living in times of great hope already). Although there are some minor plot holes, the story is great, casting is superb, acting is perfect, the effects and action scenes breath taking, even the music will take you to outer space. A really worthwhile movie. 10 out of 10. You really should see it. You won't be disappointed."

","To start, see this movie, Trekkie or not.<br/><br/>I grew up with Star Trek, literally listening to it in the back ground as a 5 year old while my parents watched every episode. Then I watched every single show myself for years, over and over. I did not go as far as dressing up Trekkie however I would buy Star Trek relics. That said, Star Trek 2009 exceeded my expectations. The movie had all the thrills, tricks, plot lines, characters, and winner outcome of any Star Trek show, generation one or two - and went the extra few light years.<br/><br/>Young crew and new effects did its job, bringing the same great feelings of the 1960's show right up to the Now. As someone who loved and made part of my thinking the original show and characters - thumbs up on to the productive of this version.<br/><br/>Even though technically this is one of those retro shows, it does not in anyway feel retro. It is like the 1960's show leaped into today, picked up with the same great affection, with a lot more action, thrills, and all around great fun.<br/><br/>Now the plot does have one silliness to it, lets just say the plot falls into a black hole for a second, but picks back up quickly.<br/><br/>A great high!

Every aspect of the movie was top-notch, from the casting and the special effects to the way the characters we all know were introduced without being showy or cheesy.

"joestank15","9","1","12","22 May 2009"," Nearly perfect mix of action and story.
","Star Trek - In lieu of successful reboots of James Bond and Batman, we have one of Star Trek. A young James Kirk (played with swagger and heart by Chris Pine) joins Starfleet to join Romulans from an alternate future in battle. He is not alone, with young Spock (played to perfection by Zachary Quinto) and a excellent supporting cast including Simon Pegg, Karl Urban (actually playing a funny character. nice)and John Cho. There are a few other surprising cameos from various TV shows, and a friend from the original show.<br/><br/>I will start by saying that I was never a big watcher of the original series. William Shatner and the low budget scared me away from it, but I found Next Generation to be a pleasing show. This film is a good combination of story, action, humor, and most importantly, characters. It's very much an ensemble piece, and rightly so. The original Star Trek was not meant to be solely about Kirk. Zachary Quinto comes close to stealing the show a few times. Spock is of two worlds and conflicted about whether to follow in his human or Vulcan roots. He and Kirk meet at Starfleet Academy, and they are not friends. Their relationship is one of the more interesting parts of the film.<br/><br/>As dodgy as the premise of time travel has become what with being abused by several sci-fi series such as the ""Terminator"" franchise and ""Heroes"", it's surprisingly well maintained here with few perceivable plot holes. Surprisingly this is one reboot that doesn't want us to forget the original. The script is also funny and allows for good characterization. The film is a nearly perfect mix of story and action.<br/><br/>There is only one kink. Eric Bana plays a rather mediocre villain Nero in comparison. He is underwritten to be fair, what with an Enterprise cast to become familiar with and all. Still a little more care should have been considered with character that commits acts to the level that Nero does.<br/><br/>Of note is the fact that the writers of the smart screenplay, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, were also responsible for the incredibly dumb Transformers screenplay. Clearly they a) have a lot more respect for Star Trek or b) were pandering to the masses with Transformers and did not feel that movie needed a clever script. What's important is that this one does. It's not so much a disguised morality tale with allusions to a present day concern like many of the television episodes were. Star Trek is firmly in the family of space opera. And why not? This fits the form of a 2 hour film much better than a 45 minute episode. And I would venture this is a Trek that everyone can find something to enjoy.<br/><br/>The action is enjoyable. Kirk is a brawler with more brawn than ability. You could play a drinking game for every time he gets the crap knocked out of him. Spock's fighting style is suitably stiff and alien. The space combat too has weight. And thank goodness there is no noise in space. The Enterprise does make a very satisfying noise when being shot into hyperspace though.<br/><br/>Another thought was given considering the remake. Historically, for every period of innovation, there are typically several decades that pay homage to that time period. The 2000s will probably be known for this. In this decade we have remade good films into bad ones like, god take your pick. We have rekindled love for tired and stale franchises, like Star Trek and James Bond. Enjoy their quality of course, but will we find our own voice and stop making love letters to the past? Star Trek gets an A-"

","""I like this ship! It's exciting!"" Scotty (Simon Pegg)<br/><br/>Producer/Director J.J. Abrams has gone where few men have gone before him—a sequel better than the original. The new Star Trek takes characters and motifs from its past, mixes up the time track, and accurately shows the enduring Kirk, Spock, and Bones in their wild days before they actually take over the decades-old franchise. For Kirk and Bones, dark humor is and always was their drug of choice.<br/><br/>The centerfold of this benign space porn is blue-eyed James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), swashbuckling captain-to-be of the USS Enterprise. What remains consistent and is emphasized this time around is his brilliance and irreverence, a leader willing to take chances with an almost flawless gut-instinct. Contrary to Spock's (Zachary Quinto) righteous logic, Kirk's instinct tells him to pursue Romulan baddie, Nero (Eric Bana), rather than regroup with federation gunships as Nero hastily moves to Earth's destruction.<br/><br/>The acting is just right for the franchise tradition, right down to Chekov (Anton Yelchin) having a loud, extreme Russian accent, amped up from Walter Koenig's original. Abrams lets Yelchin go over the top, and for that extreme I was annoyed.<br/><br/>Along the way Kirk has more adventures than James Bond on his best day, for me a few too many activities because of my interest in character development over action. But I get a bit of that development as I watch Spock struggle with his half-human emotions while Kirk abandons the rational in favor of the romantic.<br/><br/>The emphasis on leadership in this Star Trek is much more successful than ever before because we can see the importance of nature and nurture in both Kirk and Spock during their formative years. Kirk comes from a father who in the first hour of his command gives up his life for hundreds on his vessel in an act of heroism that defines the Kirkean mojo of romantic courage coupled with strategic genius.<br/><br/>As for Spock, this is what he says and who he is: ""Fear is necessary for command."""

","Like a group of elitist schoolboys, the makers of ""Star Trek"" have worked hard over the years to make the ""Star Trek"" Club as inaccessible and out of reach as possible for the everyday film-goer/television viewer. Luckily, thanks to JJ Abrams and his cast and crew on this film, the ""Members Only"" sign that so dauntingly covered the door of the franchise has been taken down, hopefully once and for all.<br/><br/>Taking a cue from the bigwigs of television, this film has put together a cast of likable and attractive young upstarts for a relatively tight, action-packed, and sequel-worthy plot line with a throbbing musical score and awe-inspiring visuals.<br/><br/>Chris Pine leads the cast in a star-making turn as Captain Kirk. He oozes charisma and doesn't fall into the trap of imitating Shatner. Similarly, Zachary Quinto creates a Spock for this generation, bringing nuances of youthful emotion to the unforgettable character. Great support comes from Zoe Seldana as a feistily intelligent Ahorra, Karl Urban as the spitting image of the original Bones McCoy, and Bruce Greenwood as the cool and collective current captain of the Enterprise. Only Eric Bana comes up short, sporting an uninspired makeup job and dishing out his lines in a questionable accent.<br/><br/>Of course, a cast is nothing without a screenplay and a plot. Fortunately, the plot here is sure to be loved by fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. The origin stories of Kirk and Spock play out beautifully. The opening scene, which centers around Kirk's father, is filled with emotional impact, starting the film- and Kirk for that matter- off with a bang. The remainder of the scenes leading up to the inevitable launch of the Enterprise sustain marvelously as well, blending funny lines and slapstick moments with more dramatic touches.<br/><br/>Once the crew finally gathers together for the mission that comprises the rest of the film, sparks are ready to fly and the adrenaline of the audience is already creeping up the scale.The film's final Act is a blast, full of exciting battles between spacecrafts and people alike. At the end of the film, emotional swelling is perfectly understandable.

","After the debacle of ""Mission: Impossible III,"" J.J. Abrams has redeemed himself as a filmmaker with the new reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise. Yes, I was prepared to hate this prequel, but it is a solid piece of entertainment with a look-alike cast, terrific special effects, warp speed momentum, and fantastic villain in Eric Bana. Happily, Leonard Nimoy's role is more than just a cameo. Most older ""Trek"" fans of my age will enjoy this sci-fi adventure opus and the maiden voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise is memorable as well as the back stories on the regular ""Star Trek"" characters. The film works not only as a prequel but also as a tribute to the venerable series.<br/><br/>Abrams and his scenarists open this epic with a bang-up sci-fi battle that coincides with the birth of Jim Kirk as his father George evacuates them off the doomed Starship U.S.S. Kelvin. They provide glimpses of the lives of Spock growing up on Vulcan and suffering the torment of Vulcan who treat him with nothing less than contempt. Meanwhile, James T. Kirk grows up to become a renegade, a daredevil. As an unruly kid, he steals his step-fathers vintage Corvette and drives it off a cliff when a motorcycle cop tries to pull him over. Clinging the edge of a cliff and trying to hoist himself up to safety becomes a way of life for Kirk. The next time we see him he tries to get fresh with a bar room of Star Fleet Academy types and they stomp him butt into the ground. Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood of ""Thirteen Days"") intervenes and tries to persuade Kirk to join Star Fleet Academy because he has the grades and he could get a command in three years.<br/><br/>Spock grows up and refuses an opportunity to serve Vulcan. Instead, he opts to become an officer in the Federation, something that seriously upsets the Vulcans who have tried to overlook his half-breed quality. Spock's father (Ben Cross) married an Earth woman while he was ambassador to Earth and Spock was a product of that union. <br/><br/>The alternate reality plot is something else. Nero plans to destroy Earth as well as other Federation planets because his planet where his wife lived was destroyed. It's a really complicated plot. Nero commands a gigantic ship that resembles briars. <br/><br/>There is a lot of action, suspense, and humor."

","I couldn't believe my eyes while I was watching this film, it's brings new life to these movies and Television shows. How many remakes have they done these past years and of course having seen all the Trek movies I didn't think this would work. I couldn't of been more wrong, in fact this Trek in such a new way of looking at the old characters. Kirk is this is a troubled kid with no direction in his life and Spock is a conflicted character who chooses a controversial path. The look of the movie brings up and beyond that of the Star Wars pictures, which is what it needed. The Star Ships are big and stylish, the technology bright and sweet to dark and menacing. I couldn't of asked for a better Star Trek film. All the old characters are in this movie but also are new in so many ways, you get to know them a little more. Scotty was an exiled member of Starfleet and Uhura had something going with somebody you wouldn't expect. It's amazing that Leonard Nimoy is actually in this film playing his old character and was actually in it for more than two minutes and plays a integral role. It seamlessly weaves the characters into the story without looking overly obvious of 'Hello, I'm Sulu, I am new navigator' or 'I'm McCoy the new doctor'. I love McCoy's first appearance, by the way. It explains him a couple sentences: '...all I've got left is my bones.' There is a part in the film where you will realize 'wow, they are really going that way' and you will know when that is. This is the New Trek and it is good."

","It's midway through the year, and it might not be illogical or inaccurate to start referring to this film, and one of the possible candidates for best production of the year. If we free ourselves from the typical restraints and expectations that such choices have to be a reflection of some attempt to canonize an important individual, a special act by an important social figure, or some misdirected, excuse the pun, portrayal of important themes, and if we are to judge a book by its contents and the outstanding components that make it a special film, we have to recognize that this film is a relevant movie, and that, after capturing our interest and earning our respect, it will be a film that many will look at for inspiration, for analysis, and most of important for giving us what most films nowadays seem to miss, a good movie that is both impressive and entertaining.<br/><br/>People go to the movies to be part of a communal experience, to enjoy a satisfying time in the darkened atmosphere of a movie theater, with a movie that has among its elements: a great storyline, very smooth direction, a terrific music score, some of the most exciting special effects in history, and to help achieve almost perfection, some excellent performances that are able to bring freshness to the iconic characters and pay tribute to the essence of a fantastic and visionary universe that has earned the devotion of millions.<br/><br/>Throughout its various reincarnations, ""Star Trek"" has captured the imagination and respect of many, and looking back at the original series, it is impossible to deny how visionary some of its elements truly are; some of the science fiction might turned out to be very real, as time goes by. Going back to a new beginning might have been a very dangerous move, and coming out successfully is even a more impressive feat.<br/><br/>The relationships between humans and vulcans is at the heart of the series, and Zachary Quinto's portrayal of the Spock character is one of the biggest gambles in this film, and the results pay handsomely; as we see an actor who understands the character, exposes himself even more than the original ever did and somehow prepares us for new and more exciting possibilities by keeping the old and fusing it with the possible new adventures, this crew might encounter.<br/><br/>In ""Star Trek"", a new plot device enables the filmmakers to create an ""alternate"" reality, which will open the way to fresh and exciting story lines, still paying tribute and respecting the original sources. As we can see from the remarkable art direction, the ships, uniforms, and the beloved look of the Enterprise remain pretty much intact. Seeing those uniforms in a brand new light was exciting, and looking at the laser guns, seeing the transition into warp from a different angle is a rush that takes a few hours to dispel. Most important is the fact that we have all the relationships still going strong. Though incidents in the new film decimate the numbers of vulcans and Romulans, their interaction survives, and to know that we can revisit the Klingons, and heaven helps us, see Khan again gives you the chills.<br/><br/>One big important detail about this new entry is how much fun it is, as it unfolds the new storyline, pays tribute to some of the films that have come before it, and it makes us raise the question, why is it that action, comedy, and adventure are rarely considered outstanding film-making and they are rarely recognized with the awards they deserve. As ""Star Trek"", moved at warp speed in front of my eyes, I couldn't help by recognizing the frantic race of Indiana Jones, trying desperately to outrun a more powerful threat, the vast and sterile, yet dangerous icy worlds of ""Empire"", the hope and possibility of learning so much, as the ramp allures you into Spock's ship, much like ""E.T.""'s own craft tempted and scared us in that film, and there's of course, hangars' resemblance to one important scene in ""Star Wars"", the design of Nemo's ship to the threats in ""Alien"", and did anyone miss the Tolkien references in Vulcan; mix in the bravado of ""Top Gun"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", and throw in some truly romantic interludes to see how this can be so appealing and satisfying.<br/><br/>This is the third time I am able to experience this amazing film, and I think it demands to be revisited and most importantly, enjoyed, over and over. Let's hope that when it is time to recognize brilliance, originality, and some original approaches, we can put aside our prejudices and see clearly what is in front of us. I shudder to think that in this day and age, Shakespeare and his love for fun, history, and the mystery of human nature would never earn him the golden prize because while he was probably shooting for the stars, he understood that what makes history and human nature remarkable and fascinating is that it all originates in the simple joys and aches of the human heart. Just look at Scott's face every time he looks at his mother in this film. Case closed."

","Star Trek 2009 - My Review Category: Movies, TV, Celebrities <br/><br/>It has never been cool to like Star Trek. In the past if you declared that you were a fan of the US sci fi franchise , people would laugh and call you a Trekkie nerd , in fact you could declare you was a anorak wearing train spotter and you would come under less criticism ......That is until now! <br/><br/>The greatest adventure of all time begins with ""Star Trek,"" the incredible story of a young crew's maiden voyage on board the most advanced starship ever created: the U.S.S. Enterprise. On a journey filled with action, comedy and cosmic peril, the new recruits must find a way to stop an evil being whose mission of vengeance threatens all of mankind.<br/><br/>The fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of bitter rivals. One, James T. Kirk , is a delinquent, thrill-seeking Iowa farm boy. The other, Spock , was raised in a logic-based society that rejects all emotion. As fiery instinct clashes with calm reason, their unlikely but powerful partnership is the only thing capable of leading their crew through unimaginable danger, boldly going where no one has gone before! <br/><br/>I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm a massive fan of Star Trek. I don't dress up as a Klingon in my spare time or go to the conventions. I don't have a room in my house decked out like the bridge aboard the Enterprise and i don't own a pair of Spock ears but i have seen every episode of every TV show that has been spurned by the Gene Roddenberry original series and i have enjoyed them all although , strangely enough the original series was my least favourite of all the different Star Trek shows.( DS9 being my favourite) Star Trek 2009 has done something that none of the other previous movies had managed to do and that is to get non fans talking about Star Trek.<br/><br/>J.J Abrams has made a film that has it all . A great story , fantastic special affects and an amazing cast and it's the casting that makes this film the success it has become. Zachary Quinto could be the son of Spock he is so perfect for the role. Relatively unknown Chris Pine is the perfect James Tiberius Kirk. Karl Urban manages to recreate the personality of ""Bones"" as if he's never been away and Simon Pegg even has the dodgy Scottish accent that Canadian James Doohan had in the original series. To be honest the story is nothing particularly special , it does not have to be , because what this film is all about is Kirk and .co. I love the frosty relationship between Kirk and Spock and the story of how they come be on the U.S.S Enterprise. Another exciting this is that because of the story the timeline has changed , meaning that everything we know to have happened in the future has now changed opening up whole new possibilities for the future of the federation and exciting new stories. <br/><br/>There has always the discussion between fans as to which was the best Star Trek movie over the years ( many have been disappointing) but now that argument has been firmly put to bed. Nothing that had previously been released comes close to being as good as this movie and i only hope that Star Trek 2009 is the shot in the arm that the franchise desperately needed and it spurns a new TV series and more films.<br/><br/>Great films are like buses . You wait for ages for one , then two come along together. <br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","Having watched between twelve and twenty TV reruns of both the William Shatner and Patrick Stewart versions of the franchise but none of the feature films I am arguably one of the best or one of the worst people to post a comment here. Overall I enjoyed this, the first full length Star Trek I have seen; it's true I can live without the technological aspect, all that hardware is lost on me but the 'people' side more than compensated and it was a great idea to do something of a 'Smallville' i.e. retrogress to a time before we met the primary characters. Again the emphasis is on the pre-'captain' Kirk and the Vulcan Spock but the others, Bones McCoy, Sulu, Scotty, Uhuru, all have their own entrances and, of course, all come together professionally in both senses of the word. All in all a fine effort."

This film had a lot of style and panache which are surely values not to be underestimated in a piece of pop culture entertainment!<br/><br/>In other aspects, well......... the film is insanely stupid, unbelievable, inane, insane, idiotic and doesn't merit any further description because nothing complementary can be forthcoming!!<br/><br/>But it does have a dazzling smile and a cracking sense of devilment.<br/><br/>I'm gonna rate it a surprising 6/10; all for style and absolutely none for substance.

"tabuno","8","0","5","20 January 2019"," Exciting and Entertainment with Weaknesses
","10 May 2009. Not perfect, but a nice tribute to the original Star Trek series. One of the best features of this new version is its casting with one big exception and smaller exception. The new engineer Scotty seems perfectly suit, down to his famous one-liners and human, McCoy has his sense of light unease, while Spock and his mannerisms and behavior most often reflect on the original Spock. Uhura seems a bit less convincing in her role, while the biggest problem with this movie is Chris Pine in the role of James T. Kirk - he doesn't seem to really have that much in common with William Shatner, there is something different about him that just doesn't seem to transfer over. Some of the best scenes are associating the old and new cast and for the most part it really comes across well, as the younger versions have similar younger attributes and characteristics of their older counter parts and the script usually does well by them.<br/><br/>While this new version has the action and the expected storyline plot, but this movie had various weaknesses that detracted somewhat from this decent and exciting sci fi movie. From the very beginning the set up was much more abrupt, even more so than the first Star Trek movie which had much more emotional punch with its build up. The special effects seemed weak with the beginning sequence, it didn't seem as vibrant nor sharp as contemporary action thriller movies are now being produced. The script while having an emotional bite, especially when it comes to Kirk's parents, there still remains a problem with the apparent manipulative and by the numbers choreography of the plot - it seems forced, like a television script. The alien ship didn't seem to have the advanced configuration nor weaponry expected of it, nor did it seem as electronically monitored as it should have been. There is even one place where the Federation weaponry seemed more like guns shooting pellets with the accompanying sound effects and at one point, Kirk even uses the word ""gun."" Uhura's relationships and feelings seem somewhat off considering what happens in the original series. The development of the characters in the beginning also seem to leave out important psychological points and so often even though this movie is supposed to afford an opportunity to reveal where many of these characters come from, a lot is missing and much of the beginning appears jumpy.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun return to the Star Trek franchise and a credible job consistent with the Star Trek series. Unfortunately, there were enough small issues that took away the complete Star Trek experience. 7/10.<br/><br/>Not since Mission Impossible (1996) came out have I had such a transformed impression of a movie, a movie which also was an adaptation of an earlier television series and like that movie, this new Star Trek movie has apparently survived through time to be able to allow me to re-experience a Star Trek experience without baggage. Even Chris Pine, as Kirk, experienced in the context of the beginning scenes does permit the belief of a truly equivalent contemporary character as the old William Shatner. There were few weaknesses that merited attention a second time around. Becoming aware that the futuristic Romulan ship wasn't an advanced warship, being aware of the more developed set up of the backstory than before, there is much to appreciate in terms of the rare use of silence of space acknowledgement, the special effects this time around seemed immersive and effective. Uhura's different character and subsequent role in the movie and relationship seemed to suffer a bit of inconsistency or confusion in contrast to the original television series and movies and appeared to the only significant imbalance in this movie."

","Star Trek is an unnecessary reboot in my opinion. JJ Abrabs is a talented filmmaker and it is easy to see his enthusiasm (he is almost like a fanboy giddily recreating all his favorite childhood movies) and rigor but the reboot and especially the cast will always suffer from comparison with the original TV series. Furthermore, although the film is interesting and gets everything sorted- in as much as one can in less than 2 hours- there is a rushed feeling to the proceedings. The special effects are good but we've seen it all by now, the razzle and dazzle only goes so far. The Star trek reboot isn't a bad film as much as an unneeded one."

","""Star Trek"" has nothing to boast about, but neither does it have anything to apologize for. It is a decent film and nothing more.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: For those unfamiliar with the concept of Star Trek, this film can be a bit too much to handle. There is a lot to keep straight. Capturing the attention of people who do not love the world of Star Trek is not easy. Pleasing the fans of the Star Trek of old is even harder. The story is rather bland and a bit messy. Abram's directing style makes it even more difficult to watch. There seems to be a lack of professionalism in the storytelling. *Cinematography/Editing: The color palette and camera movements are relatively pleasing thanks to the work of Dan Mindel. However, Abrams' obsession with lens flares and canted angles take away from the otherwise effective cinematography. The editing is adequate. Nothing jarring or overly ambitious. The action sequences are easy to follow and feel well timed. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue has a certain nerdy quality to it that is to be expected in a sci-fi film. It does not ruin the film for casual viewers, but it doesn't make it easy, either. The acting of Chris Pine carries most of the film in order to help it stay afloat. Karl Urban's talents are wasted on a poorly realized character with little depth. Most other actors are average in their performances, but not exceptional. *Music/Sound Design: The score is repetitive and rather uninteresting. It does not heighten any emotions in any scene. The sound design is interesting and is one of the strengths of the film. It falls into the realm of sci-fi very well and provides an immersive soundscape. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set and locations are captivating and beautiful. Most of the film feels authentic and immersive. The wardrobe is less impressive. Much of the costume work feels uninspired. The special effects and visual effects are quite impressive, however. Nothing stands out as being fake or cheap looking.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Star Trek"" fails to impress in most instances, but it also keeps from being too disappointing."

"boobah-50476","6","0","2","21 July 2016"," Kind of felt all over the place...
","In preparation for tonight's Star Trek Beyond release, I decided to re-watch the first two movies and review them, because why not?<br/><br/>I think it's probably important to note that I haven't see the TV show. I've seen parts here and there but I think my opinion of the movies might be different than a huge fan of the show. I just started to watch the movies and I love it so much, I think I might start the show soon.<br/><br/>What I Liked <br/><br/>It's weird seeing actors you know playing other roles... I get it, that's their job. But imagining Thor and Emma Swan (Once Upon a Time) as the parent's of Kirk is really funny... side note over.<br/><br/>This Star Trek movie is kind of an origin story, at least in the beginning. We get to see Kirk's parents, Kirk as a mischievous kid and Spock on Vulcan. It's fun to see the characters we come to love as little kids :D so cute, so adorable. I want to hug them and their high pitched little voices. Is that weird? I hope not XD but little Spock was so cute, he has so much sass. I love Spock... I am a Spock fan...<br/><br/>Another thing that made the whole origin story aspect great was how the two separate character plots came together. We see Spock at his school excelling at his education and then we see him leave it all for Starfleet. We see Kirk get into a fight and accept a dare to join Starfleet. I really liked how their two separate stories came into one.<br/><br/>The actors were perfect for their characters! I looooooove these characters. I love their bickering and fighting, I love their quick disagreements. They were amusing and funny, especially Spock vs Kirk which went on pretty much since they met. They go back and forth so much, it's hilarious.<br/><br/>The visual effects in this were amazing! I liked all the lens flair looking things, the battle lasers (laaaassserrrrs), the alien's looked interesting, just everything. This movie really did a great job transporting you into a world filled with aliens and futuristic technology.<br/><br/>What I Didn't Like<br/><br/>As much as I liked a lot about this movie, it wasn't as good as the second one to me. This Star Trek movie starts off by throwing you into the action. From the first second the movie starts, there is fighting and explosions and confusion if you have no idea what is going on. <br/><br/>The origin part that I loved so much, ended up making the movie seem choppy because it was always jumping back and forth between Spock and Kirk as kids, as teens, slowly growing up. I just didn't like all the back and forth between characters, it wasn't smooth.<br/><br/>Star Trek is science fiction, I get that, but the action in this movie was non-stop. There was too much fighting, too many explosions that it ended up feeling... overused? I like it when there is some action because it means more, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie was the villain. He was... lame. Unlike the second movie, this villain didn't feel threatening, and was taken out way to easily. He did some pretty bad things I will admit that, but I mean... he wasn't Khan. Khan was a monster, this guy? He was... a caterpillar.<br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>All in all, Star Trek was all over the place. It was a pretty good origin~ish story for Kirk and Spock and how his team was formed, but it was choppy. The villain wasn't that bad and there was way too much action for my taste."
"SquigglyCrunch","7","0","2","12 February 2016"," Fun to Watch, but Very Predictable
","I went into this movie with some expectations. Having already seen it and the second one years ago and enjoying both, I figured I'd give them a watch before the release of the new one. For the most part my opinion of this movie has remained unchanged, which isn't a bad thing. <br/><br/>The plot of Star Trek is an interesting one. The overall idea of the story I think is too overused in modern movies, but this movie handled it well. While it played an important role in the plot, it wasn't the primary focus of the movie. There were subtle hints at it here and there at it too, so it wasn't like it just came out of nowhere because J.J. Abrams ran out of ideas. I don't want to spoil it, but when you see it you will know what I'm talking about. Other than that, it's very predictable and formulaic. While this isn't always bad thing, it was a little too obvious in my eyes to just ignore. It probably didn't help that I remembered the second one better than the first, so there was never any real tension for me, but either way it's very formulaic. <br/><br/>The characters are quite good in this movie. James Kirk doesn't feel like your average hero, nor does Spock. I personally liked the side characters the most, specifically Scotty. I think that the main characters received enough screen time so that you knew that they were the main characters and you still cared enough about them, but they didn't get so much that it was annoying, or that the writers ran out of ideas and started forcing in average hero clichés that nobody wants. They were above average, and while not great, were still better than a lot of other movies. <br/><br/>The movie is just a lot of fun to watch. The visuals are great, the creature and ship designs are great. The fights are super fun, and the tone is, while often serious, still quite light-hearted, and it's a healthy amount of light-heartedness, not too much, not too little. <br/><br/>Overall Star Trek is just a lot of fun, while still maintaining a good enough plot and good enough characters to keep you interested for the entire run-time. I had loads of fun watching it, and while I wasn't too impressed with the predictable formula it decided to use, I was still able to largely enjoy this film. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone just looking for a bucket of fun to pour all over themselves."

","""Star Trek"" was another step to directing stardom for J. J. Abrams after ""Lost"" and ""Mission Impossible 3"". And also his success with this film here may be the main reason that he got the nod for directing the new Star Wars movie that will come out in roughly a month. But back to this one. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto play the main characters and both do a fine job with what they are given, especially Quinto. The film runs for slightly over 2 hours and the inclusion of the late Leonard Nimoy, the original Spock, will be appreciated by fans of the series. But it should also be appreciated by everybody else as Nimoy's parts were heart and soul of the movie. But also all the other actors that I haven't mentioned so far did a fine job. It was actually a nice, surprising development for me that Saldana's character ended up with Spock and not with Kirk as I thought early on in the film.<br/><br/>Apart from the really well-written story that is really smart and has many interesting details, this film's strength is as well that it does not take itself so seriously. There are quite a few funny parts in here, mostly coming from Kirk interacting with others, especially Urban's character. This film was nominated for 4 Oscars and won one in a year of famous alien films with great special effects. I personally would rank it below ""District 9"", but above ""Avatar"". ""Star Trek"" got me curious about the sequel too and I hope Abrams can make the next ""Star Wars"" just like he succeeded with this 6-year-old film here. Good job by everybody involved. The introduction was good, the character development was a success and the final battle sequences were not truly memorable, but I'd take that any time about a movie which comes short on the other aspects I just mentioned. Still, the ending was nice and not a failure after all. I must say I found Bana's character a bit uninteresting, which is a shame as I quite like him as an actor (especially in ""Munich""), but maybe that is just personal perception. This is a good movie and you will probably even really love it if you appreciate the sci-fi genre more than I do. Thumbs up."

","I was for a long time really excited about the new movies. I've watched Star Trek when I was younger, especially the enterprise series and I loved them. I couldn't wait for the reboot with one of my favorite actors Zachary Quinto. <br/><br/>Unfortunately I was really disappointed. There was 0 depth in this story and the story itself was at sometimes cringe worthy. Like when Kirk had a severe reaction to the medicine (Although I found that whole part very stupid..) and suddenly he hears lighting storm in space and he wakes up, running through the whole ship towards the person who forbade him to be on this ship. I wondered, when he was taken to the medical bay, did somebody besides bones check up on him or even noticed him and thought: hey this is not right, he shouldn't be here? It just seemed illogical and very immature how that whole scene went. Considering he made a name for himself during that test. Same goes for the bar fight and he touches that girls boobs. That belongs in an American pie movie.. Some scenes felt very childish and off the script, like it didn't belong there or anywhere in the movie (especially the lame ass jokes).<br/><br/>My second thing is the camera-work. They couldn't hold the camera still for 1 second! Everything was shaky like the cameraman couldn't focus, even with close-ups. I didn't now where to look at and I've never been bothered with camera-work before (except for low budget found footage horror movie). It felt really amateurish to me. <br/><br/>After an hour of the movie I fell asleep and woke up half an hour later. I asked my boyfriend, what happened, did I miss anything? He said a few bits, but it didn't felt like it. I was back in the story like nothing happened. The last half hour we turned it off. My boyfriend already seen it and I didn't care much for everything.<br/><br/>The good things where the actors. They all did excellent and played their roles very well. I also loved the scenery and all the beautiful pictures of space. I am still going to see the second one from 2011. I always have problems with the first movie of a reboot. Same goes for Batman Begins, found it very boring, I was sleeping again. But the second movie made everything right. I hope it same goes for this movies."

Abrams, gives the ""Star Trek"" franchise a visual upbeat by directing first class stuntmen and visual effects teams to whip up consistently stunning visuals when Abrams decides to use them./ Abrams focuses too much on the boring emotional struggles between some of the most ridiculous sci-fi characters t date. Captain Kirk and Commander Spock take the screen and are the main focus throughout the remake, like in every other ""Star Trek"" screen work. With about three ""Star Trek"" fans writing the script, ""Star Trek"" still feels like a routine get together to reinvent a story that feels like a routine tour with everyone going through the motions to try and surprise and remind Trekies about the glory of this praised franchise. On the day of James Kirk's (Chris Pine) birth, his father dies on his ship in a last stand against a mysterious alien time-traveling vessel looking for Ambassador Spock (Zachary Quinto), who, in this time, is also a child on Vulcan disdained by his neighbors for his half-human heritage. Twenty-five years later, Kirk has grown into a young troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy instructors like young Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. I have never been a ""Star Trek"" fan, but multiple sources say Abrams honors old ""Star Trek"" entertainment while trying something new simultaneously. I was bored to tears by this one. Abrams focuses more on the emotional story and sets us up for probably three more films to come while not taking advantage of his ability to create stunning visuals."

"GusF","Null","0","1","5 December 2014"," Not only a bad film but ""Star Trek"" in name only
","When I saw this in the cinema, I loved it. Looking back, I think that that was because I had been completely starved of new ""Star Trek"" for four years and was willing to accept it on that basis alone. Unfortunately, it does not hold up on a second viewing with a more critical eye. Continuing with the Bond comparison that I made in my review of ""Nemesis"", it is trying to be ""Star Trek""'s answer to ""Casino Royale"" but it falls far short of that. The reason is that that film was made by people who understood Bond while this film was not made by people who understood ""Star Trek"".<br/><br/>On the bright side, Chris Pine is very good as Kirk, perfectly capturing the character's cockiness, intelligence and resourcefulness without doing an imitation of William Shatner. However, I thought that Kirk and McCoy - played very well by Karl Urban - were the only characters who were really treated well in the film. Given that the alternate reality Kirk grew up without the benefit of a father or even a decent father figure, it's unsurprising that he turned out differently than the TOS Kirk, who was far less rebellious in his youth, and this is handled well. That said, an issue that I had this Kirk's backstory was that his mother's influence on him is never mentioned. After she gives birth to him, she is mentioned exactly twice in the film and never by Kirk himself. Why is it that the influence of mothers is often ignored in films like this? I had a similar problem with the original ""Star Wars"" in which the orphan Luke Skywalker asks Obi-Wan about his father and it seemingly never occurred to him to ask him if he knew his mother. It'd be the first question that I'd ask after meeting someone who knew my father.<br/><br/>Other than McCoy who is characterised perfectly, the rest of the TOS regular characters come across as caricatures rather than characters in their own right. The alternate reality Spock never really seems like Spock and this is not helped by the fact that Zachary Quinto is no Leonard Nimoy, whose participation in the film is by far the best part of it incidentally. I literally cheered when he appeared on screen. I really, really hope that Spock jettisoning Kirk for mutiny was supposed to be a sign of his emotional instability after the death of his mother and the destruction of Vulcan since, otherwise, there is no reason for it to happen other than the script said it had to for Kirk to meet the original Spock. My hopes are not high in that regard though.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's Scotty is sort of funny but bears little resemblance to Scotty. Zoe Saldana and Anton Yelchin are likable as Uhura and Chekov and at least seem more like their TOS counterparts than Scotty does but they don't make much impression. Can't say that I'm terribly excited about the Spock / Uhura romance. John Cho makes no impression as Sulu, delivering every line in a monotone. Like Nimoy, Ben Cross and Bruce Greenwood add some much needed dignity to the film as Sarek and Captain Pike respectively. Eric Bana is boring as Nero who, much like Shinzon in ""Nemesis"", is another poor man's Khan. He too is obsessed with having his revenge against one of the main characters whom he blames for the death of his wife.<br/><br/>Lots and lots of lens flare but every joke about them has been done to death so I'll leave that there. I can't criticise the special effects which are state of the art and many of the action scenes are well done but because the script is nowhere near as intelligent as those of earlier ""Star Trek"" films, it's hard to really care about them. The film looks good but so what? Most big budget films do. That doesn't make them good in and of themselves. Anyway, for me, the special effects in a film are like the side dish while the acting and the script, both of which aren't great overall in this case, are the main course. ""Star Trek"" has always been about big ideas and social commentary rather than flashy effects and stuff getting blowed up real good and this film just doesn't get that. Now, let's be honest, scientific accuracy was never ""Star Trek""'s strongest suit but the idea of a star going supernova threatening the galaxy is complete hokum.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a terrible film but it is both a bad film and a bad ""Star Trek"" film. I actually preferred ""The Final Frontier"" and ""Nemesis"" to this one. At the end of the day, I'd rather have bad ""Star Trek"" films with characters whom I love than bad films that are ""Star Trek"" in name only with generally poor versions of said characters."
"rhfry","7","0","1","30 July 2014"," Irresponsible
","First of all I'd like to say that this is by no means a bad movie. It has stunning visuals which is typical of a J.J. Abrams film. It also has a decent plot and character development but considering the Star Trek canon that has already been established in the form of the television series and the previous movies it just seems like very irresponsible film making to just take the easy way out and change the reality and everything that happened and render it virtually useless because of this movie. The only way I see this being a good idea is if they brought back Captain Kirk who was killed in a previous film which I would have been on board for because he should have never been killed in the first place. Abrams was never a fan of Star Trek and therefore can not understand how insulting this is to a fan of Star Trek. It is quite convenient to be able to use an alternate reality to do whatever you want with a long tradition of storytelling and I believe it to be lazy writing, disrespectful to the previous cast and fans, and as previously stated just outright irresponsible film making. If they were gonna change reality then they darn well should have made kirk live.....hopefully they will bring Kirk back in the third installment of this reboot."

Kirk discovers, during the flight that the attackers are the same ones that had attacked his father's ship in the past. After that he finds himself captaining the Enterprise with the person who hates the most, Mr Spock. The story line is clean and neat, keeping a simple but entertaining line of events that doesn't get the audience confused. The past and future combine nicely, providing a good picture of what is happening and what will happen in the end. The performances are good too, not great though. And the lines seem to be forced to be funny, sometimes they succeed , sometimes they don't. An other annoying thing about the movie are the lights that keep changing, from bright to dark, throughout the bigger length of the movie. But the music is good, very 'star trek', the special effects quite convincing and the action scenes enough and not tiring, which is always a dangerous path for this kind of films.

","When doing a reboot of a famous franchise, the director can either attempt to make a remake of the original or can make it his or her own and completely tear apart even the most basic part of a franchise. J.J. Abrams' reboot Star Trek (2009) toes the line between these two options. Abrams delivers a modified Star Trek universe but still manages to remain rooted in the franchise's origins.<br/><br/>Abrams' reboot of the Star Trek franchise has given its audience a new and unique beginning to the popular franchise. The film opens with a time traveling Romulan spaceship emerging from a black hole. The Romulans (an extraterrestrial humanoid species) are seeking vengeance for an event that has yet to occur and in the process destroy the star ship that Captain Kirk's father was piloting. This event and various other atrocities committed by the Romulans throughout the film deviate from the original Star Trek timeline. By constructing an alternate timeline, Abrams allows himself to work freely within the Star Trek universe without confining himself to the intricacies of the franchise's canon. This opens up a new world of possibilities for Abrams to explore. He can revisit formerly vanquished nemeses, while also broadening the franchise's horizons.<br/><br/>Abrams' Star Trek is set prior to the original series. The audience witnesses the maiden voyage of the USS Enterprise crewed by inexperienced cadets. We observe a period in the Star Trek timeline before the Enterprise's crew became a close-knit group of companions. The audience is able to look on as bonds form amongst the crew. <br/><br/>The relationship between Jim Kirk (played by Chris Pine) and Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) is in the forefront of the film's plot line. Initially, Kirk and Spock have a tense relationship. Each character views himself as the alpha male of the group and more deserving of a leadership role. <br/><br/>Kirk is a confident, arrogant, and hotheaded human male who makes major decisions based on his emotions, often without considering the repercussions of his actions. Spock, on the other hand, is a calm and rational thinking Vulcan who always takes into consideration the most logical course of action. Spock appears to be the better leader, but ultimately the confident and fast thinking Kirk takes command. Initially, their conflicting personalities serve as the reason for their rivalry, but such differences will eventually result in the two becoming lifelong friends.<br/><br/>Abrams ends the film where the franchise ultimately began in 1966 with the USS Enterprise's mission statement: ""Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before."" As the original series has soared to lofty heights, so shall Abrams' rebooted franchise. He has created a film that not only fans of the Star Trek universe will enjoy, but also common moviegoers. Thanks to Abrams, the Star Trek franchise will continue to live long and prosper."
"cleary-joshua","7","0","1","16 February 2014"," Where 'Star Trek' fails is in its methods as a sci-fi/action film...
","How much you enjoy a film 'reboot' can often depend on what you saw of the original source material. Before I had seen 'Batman Begins' or 'Casino Royale', I had little experience of those franchises, and went in with no expectations of what the film should be. I am of the firm belief that my hatred of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' stems mostly from my love of the original Tobey Maguire films, and the fact that they just don't do as good a job. My experience of 'Star Trek' was almost non existent. I was very aware of the show, its fans, and really liked ""Galaxy Quest"", but had never actually watched the TV show. The movie's success comes in its ability to make itself accessible to an audience of non-Trekkies, while likely still pleasing the fans. Where it fails is in its methods as a sci-fi/action film.<br/><br/>'Star Trek' goes down the 'origins' story route, a method that should be familiar to reboot fans. We learn about James Kirk and how he became captain of the Starship Enterprise. It's an interesting, yet somewhat clichéd character arc which he undergoes – he's a wild child that has to become responsible in order to fill his destiny. However, Chris Pine plays it well, ensuring that you care enough about him throughout. Zachary Quinto is the real star as the film, and is emotionally convincing as Mr. Spock. The Spock/Kirk dynamic is something that works extremely well, and there's some great chemistry between the two characters. Also, the scenes on earth and those leading up to Kirk's arrival on the Enterprise are the best of the film, bringing light- relief and character development together very well.<br/><br/>Because of the need for character changes throughout, the plot takes a slightly more backseat role, and for a large percentage between the opening sequence and about halfway, you forget about the film's main villain. The visual effects are stunning, as you might expect from JJ Abrams, and do help to make the film more exciting. The 'origins' plot does mean that action is more sidelined, with few great action sequences throughout. And, unfortunately, this causes the film to drag at times.<br/><br/>I imagine, were I a huge 'Star Trek' fan, the film would be much more rewarding, as it seems to pay fan service frequently with references here and there, and especially the appearance of Leonard Nimoy. But as an outsider, I was frequently disinterested by the film. The film does have great moments, but I think this is one franchise which I won't be returning to. Hopefully JJ Abrams' attempts at 'Star Wars' are more like the superb 'Super 8′, and less like this."

","In the year 2387, where the galaxy is threatened by an unusual phenomenon caused by a volatile supernova. In that future, Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy) pilots the Jellyfish (refer: Star Trek: Countdown) ship which carries the red matter, of which he intended to create an artificial black hole to consume the supernova.<br/><br/>Before Spock could eventually succeed, the supernova no doubt has destroyed the planet Romulus where the entire population of the Romulans were eradicated. While Captain Nero (Eric Bana) aboard the Romulan mining ship Narada were emotionally hurt to see his planet being remotely destroyed in an instant black death. He vowed to avenge his people, his wife and child on Spock Prime and the Federation.<br/><br/>Somewhere in between of the scenarios, both ships are caught in the black hole's event horizon and travel to different points in the past. The Narada arrives first, 154 years earlier, and attacks the Federation starship USS Kelvin. As the Kelvin is evacuated, acting-Captain George Kirk stays behind to provide cover for the fleeing shuttlecraft. George pilots the Kelvin into the Narada in a last ditch ramming attack, moments after George's son, James Tiberius Kirk, is born aboard a fleeing shuttle. Spock arrives 25 years later only to be captured by Nero and marooned on the planet Delta Vega so that he can witness the destruction of Vulcan.<br/><br/>Kirk (Chris Pine) grows to be an intelligent but reckless and cynical young man. After Kirk is beaten badly in a bar-fight while attempting to pick up Uhura (Zoe Saldaña).<br/><br/>Captain Christopher Pike tells him of his father's heroic efforts and convinces him to join Starfleet. Kirk befriends fellow cadet Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban).<br/><br/>In his third year at the Academy, Kirk is accused of cheating on the Kobayashi Maru test by its programmer, Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). At the resultant hearing, Starfleet receives a distress signal from Vulcan that indicates the appearance of a lightning storm in space, and the cadets are mobilized to help crew the ships in orbit. McCoy brings the grounded Kirk onboard the USS Enterprise as a patient under McCoy's care.<br/><br/>The Enterprise arrives at Vulcan to find the rest of the fleet destroyed and the Narada drilling into Vulcan's core. After the Enterprise is attacked by the Narada, Pike surrenders, giving Spock command of the ship and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, Hikaru Sulu (John Cho), and Chief Engineer Olson perform a space jump onto the drilling platform, disabling it. However, it has drilled deep enough for Nero to launch ""red matter"" into the core, creating an artificial black hole. The black hole consumes the planet, killing most of the population, including Spock's mother.<br/><br/>As Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's perimeter defenses, Spock maroons Kirk on Delta Vega for mutiny after Kirk argues against Spock's orders. Kirk encounters Ambassador Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who explains that he and Nero are from the future. 129 years in the future, the galaxy is threatened by a volatile supernova. Spock intended to use the ""red matter"" to create a black hole to stop the supernova, but the supernova's nebula destroyed the planet Romulus before he could act, killing Nero's wife. Nero attacked Spock's vessel with the Narada, and both were caught in the event horizon of the black hole, sending them back in time. Nero captured Spock and stranded him on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction.<br/><br/>Spock and Kirk walk to a nearby Starfleet outpost, where they meet Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg). With Ambassador Spock's help, Kirk and Scott beam onto the Enterprise in flight. Following Ambassador Spock's advice, Kirk mocks Spock's lack of emotion to provoke an emotional response. An incensed Spock chokes Kirk before he recognizes his emotional compromise; he relinquishes command to Kirk.<br/><br/>Spock speaks with his father, Sarek and then decides to work with Kirk and joins Kirk in a bold plan for a sneak attack on the Narada. After the Enterprise hides itself under the gas clouds of Titan, Kirk and Spock beam aboard the Narada; Kirk rescues Pike while Spock uses Ambassador Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads the Narada away from Earth and then programs his ship to collide with the Narada. Just prior to impact, the Enterprise arrives and beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock away. Ambassador Spock's ship and the Narada collide, igniting the ""red matter"" and creating a black hole that destroys the Narada and almost claims the Enterprise.<br/><br/>On Earth, Kirk is promoted to the rank of Captain and given command of the Enterprise, while Captain Pike is promoted to rear admiral. Spock encounters his older self in a Starfleet hangar; Ambassador Spock has selected a planet for the surviving Vulcans to colonize. He dissuades his younger self from resigning from Starfleet to help his species, encouraging him to do what feels right, instead of what is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet and becomes first officer under Kirk's command. The film ends with the Enterprise going to warp as Ambassador Spock.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>It was not bad at all. A fresh reboot for Star Trek film. The upbringing lifestyle of Jim Kirk being the young and reckless even upon joining the Starfleet.<br/><br/>Pine delivers with lots of humor in it to make the movie less serious and much more interesting. Quinto as Spock is mesmerizing yet he carries his role very careful."

","It took me a while to get around to this film, as I am always sceptical about prequels and revisits. They have a tendency to be revisionist. So I waited until I found it quite cheaply, in a charity shop (favourite haunts of film collectors like me). But I needn't have waited. This film is excellent. Whilst not as tongue in cheek as Star Trek the motion picture, it has the approachability and the impact that has characterised most of the franchise. Chris Pine's Kirk is every bit as brash and arrogant as Shatner's, and Zachary Quinto's Spock has the immaturity and uncertainty hinted at in Spock's youth, by The Search For Spock, and shows all the requisite signs of becoming the older Spock we all know. I have heard it said that the special effects don't have enough impact, but the restraint shown here actually makes the film more believable as a possible future."

"powsean2000","7","0","1","15 December 2013"," Film Review
","The film, Star Trek (2009), is a story following James Tiberius Kirk, a young man that lost his father in the line of duty on Starfleet, as he becomes the Captain of the Starship Enterprise, following in his father's footsteps. The plot plays out through Kirk's interactions with main characters such as Spock, Scotty, and Pike, as well as his fight against the angry Romulan, Captain Nero, who is set on destroying Starfleet, Earth, and the Vulcan home planet. James Tiberius Kirk is played by Chris Pine, Spock is played by Zachary Quinto, Captian Christopher Pike is played by Bruce Greenwood, and Captain Nero is played by Eric Bana. The film's theme is that of destiny and one's path to achieve that destiny. It's about Kirk's destiny to become Captain of the Enterprise. Spock Prime, played by Leonard Nemoy, points out destiny as he is helping Kirk return to the Enterprise to take over command and even helps him by showing him the way of winning command from the present day Spock. The film is also about Spock's destiny of being a support and confidant of Kirk, as it would be impossible for Kirk to remain Captain without him. This theme is strengthened in the film and made more complex by the presence of time travel, which, according to Spock Prime and later present day Spock, can alter destiny and ""the flow of history."" This later is strengthened by Kirk still becoming the Captain even though the flow of history has changed. This theme is complicated even more in the sequel to this film, Star Trek Into Darkness, where Kirk's command is taken from him because he was not intellectually ready to receive that destiny. The story uses the motif of emotion versus logic almost to the point of it being a theme. In The Art of Watching Film, Boggs and Petrie tell us that motifs ""are variations or aspects of the major theme"" (p.33). Emotion versus logic plays a large role in the forming of Kirk and Spock's destinies and intertwines the two characters together. This motif first shows itself when young Spock loses control and fights other Vulcans for calling his father a traitor. Kirk is then connected to this motif when Captain Pike suggests that Kirk is following impulse or emotion rather than trying to achieve his destiny of following in his father's footsteps and achieving greatness. A very interesting scene in which this motif and the overall theme are achieved is when Kirk finally succeeds in becoming the Captain of the Enterprise by getting Spock to show that he is emotionally compromised. What I noticed while watching this scene is the camera view. It uses the extreme close-up technique, which, as Boggs tells us in The Art of Watching Film, requires that we focus on Kirk and Spock arguing, with it being so close ""that we cannot look elsewhere"" (p. 136). I think this technique was used to create the illusion that we were there in the room, observing the interaction as if we were part of the crew. After making this observation, it appeared to me that much of Star Trek was filmed in this manner. This technique made me part of the film. I believe that the use of this technique allows us as the viewer to become immersed in the theme of the film as well as any motif that is used to support it."

","This was preceded on Film4 with a short interview with JJ Abrams where he stated that during the production of this film he wasn't too bothered as to what the fans wanted and only concentrated on making a film that would appeal to cinema audiences . This is only to be congratulated because I watched this on the say day as Peter Capaldi was cast as the Doctor in DOCTOR WHO . If Moffat has scrawled through the DOCTOR WHO boards on this site we'd be getting a 20 something pretty boy again , something the show doesn't need and if you're making a movie profits need to be taken in to the equation . You make a film a handful of sad anoraks will love and everyone else hates you're talking a major fail <br/><br/>Abrams task is going to be very hard . The characters in STAR TREK aren't James Bond or DOCTOR WHO , they're characters immortalised by William Shatner , Leonard Nimoy but Abrams manages to pull it off and it's fascinating to watch characters who are fundamentally the same we know from the television series played by different actors and having slightly different character traits . Spock is probably the closest to being the same as the TV character being an emotionless logic Vulcan but his character is fleshed out and stops him from being a one note cypher that he could have been and even has an emotional scene that might surprise you . If there's a problem with reintroducing these characters then it's because they're all allotted a five to ten minute sequence that screams "" This is Chekov/Sulu/Scotty and the plot will now revolve around them for several minutes then we'll forget all about them after they've been introduced "" <br/><br/>This interferes with the main story of a Romulan being on a revenge mission against the Federation and isn't all that strong a plot though to be honest it's much better than the one we got with the pretentious STAR TREK motion picture from 1979 . Perhaps one of the major problems is that the film never really recovers from the great opening pre-title sequence where a trick is played on the audience featuring Captain Kirk , and we're treated to a great action sequence and a couple of hours after seeing it I was very impressed by the sequence where a female crew member is blown out of a spaceship and her body bounces along the hull of the ship as the sound cuts to silence mirroring the empty silence of Space <br/><br/>In summary this is a relatively good action adventure Summer blockbuster featuring a legendary television franchise . I'm not a fan of STAR TREK but did enjoy seeing how a successful franchise can be reinvented and the character scenes work very well and I don't view this as any sort of heresy . It does get a bit loud , noisy and a little bit too spectacular but I guess this is down to it being a Summer blockbuster and believe me if it was made by Michael Bay it would have been a lot worse"

","Having watched Start Trek second time round after a two-year pause, this time prefaced by Abrahams himself explaining his own unique ""twist"" of the Roddenberry saga I feel, as lifelong fan of the Star Trek series to add some constructive but positive comments. It must be mainly a preserve of the male sex in that we sometimes long for dreams from which we never have to awaken. My emotions in identifying with the characters I had literally grown up with were ones of blissful reassurance. The five main characters they had somehow been plucked from the multitude to resemble the previous ones right down to the peculiar mannerisms that entranced and entertained us during on those cathode ray tube 70s days. I think the plot would not have been as plausible without other Hollywood blockbusters such as the Back-To trilogy that had preceded it to prepare and mollify our perceptions as to the implications of the space/time paradox. I think the reality of the situation by the end of the movie had just about dawned upon me - that there was no going back, and that the reality of the ""new future"" and follow-on movies would start from this ""Idée fixe"". I really loved the suspense and the swashbuckling antics of Chris Pines' new Kirk. Undeniably the best movie of 2009."

But that's what you can expect when the director admits he didn't like Star Trek. The film is filled (absolutely filled) with continuity errors and hackneyed dialogue and characterizations. Sulu is Japanese...so there's an excuse to put a Katana in his hand. Vulcan is being destroyed and Uhura jumps up from her station to give Spock a hug? Vulcan is being swallowed by a black hole, but that's not affecting the ice moon that's orbiting it? (An ice moon over pretty much a desert planet?) The engine room looked like the boiler room of an apartment building I used to live in. Chekov can run down several flights of stairs faster then terminal velocity? Absolutely the only member of the cast who deserves any recognition is the guy who played McCoy. Even Leonard Nimoy should be ashamed of his participation."

","As a child and teenager, I grew up with the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". While I was never a hardcore Star Trek fan, I did enjoy quite a few seasons of that series as well as ""Star Trek: Voyager"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"". Still, the original series never really appealed to me. They always came off as outdated in so many ways I guess I outgrew them before I had the chance to get into them.<br/><br/>""Star Trek: The Future Begins"" didn't really manage to impress me, largely because it's basically nothing but barely disguised ""fan service"" for the fans of the original series stretched in a thin two hour plot.<br/><br/>That plot evolves around two heroes : Spock and James T. Kirk. After a couple of scenes depicting their childhood, both meet each other as Starfleet cadets during a pretty contrived conflict and end up in a couple more conflicts until they realize they need to overcome their differences and collaborate to save the future of the earth. That pretty much sums up the whole plot.<br/><br/>Several supporting characters from the original series are also included in the movie, although they're given so little screen time and character development you barely get to know them at all. All the attention goes to Spock and James T. Kirk, and even these characters are barely developed beyond caricatures. The main protagonist of the story has been given a back story not just very thin but so far-fetched and random he felt more like an afterthought than an integral plot of the movie. <br/><br/>While the visual effects were as professional as one would expect of a movie with this budget, I also wasn't impressed by the movie when I tried to forget about all the plot holes and just tried looking at pretty pictures. Too much shaky cam, a ridiculous amount of annoying lens flares, awkward close-ups and an ADHD pacing gave the movie not nearly the amount of eye-candy I most definitely did expect of a movie like this, leaving me mostly disappointed by the time the credits passed the screen.<br/><br/>I did very much appreciate the movie's sense of humor, though, but jokes were too few and too far in between to be a redeeming factor."

","As background, I am not an avid Star Trek fan. Saw quite a few of episodes of the original TV series, several in the second, and none in any of the following series. I have seen all the films, however. Hated the first one (but so did almost everyone else). Never understood the attraction of Shatner's Kirk.<br/><br/>So. I loved this reboot. The new actor, Chris Pine, is completely believable as a younger Shatner without the self-parody that the original exuded. In fact, all the actors obviously were picked for some physical resemblance to the originals and obviously worked at sounding like the originals when they talk. That, of course, isn't all that's required for a good film, but it did make the film feel as if it were really about the same folks, which I liked.<br/><br/>The movie hooked me emotionally into the characters. The pacing carried me along very well. And the plot kept my interest, if not entirely making sense in a few key places, but not enough to take me out of the movie."
"cgharlow","6","0","1","26 May 2013"," Great Action Flick, But Check Your Brain At The Door...
","Probably the primary reason you will find such mixed reviews of this movie is due to 2 different audiences. This is a well-acted, extremely fun action flick. It is a terrible science fiction movie with a very poorly thought out plot.<br/><br/>The film is aimed at the same audience that thoroughly enjoyed Independence Day, and, if you are such a person, you will have a blast watching Into Darkness. Knowledge of Star Trek really isn't required, although there are a lot of homage references to past Star Trek shows / movies as well as specific references to a previous Star Trek movie. The characters are well acted and there is plenty of action sequences in both space and on the ground that satisfy. There is plenty of chemistry between the primary characters that will undoubtedly be used to good effect in future installments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot is not something to think about too closely. My 11 year old son pointed out a big problem himself with how things wrapped up (yes, 11 years old) which should be a big red flag. As someone pointed out, it really feels like a bunch of sets were put together, and the plot strung together weakly to utilize the sets.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is an appropriate sequel to the 2009 reboot, and anyone that uncritically enjoyed that movie will uncritically enjoy this one as well. Those that had issues with the 2009 reboot will find no solace in this movie either. I highly recommend the movie as a generic action flick and enjoy the ride."

","This is a stunning piece of action with over the top sci-fi. The tone of the movie sets from its very offset. I believe that since I had no star trek background, I was immediately playing the catching up role and this really gripped me throughout.<br/><br/>Firstly, the graphics of the movie pulls you. Action scenes were quite breathtaking. This is more of an improbable sci-fi where time travel is again exploited but executed quite well. All the elements of fantasy of science are involved in the movie - relativity, black holes, warp speeds and what not. Secondly, the performances of the cast are quite to the script. Though, the focus on individual characters except James Kirk and Spock is quite less and the roles are not really challenging for any of the characters. This movie lives on its concept alone.<br/><br/>By the time I was in sync with the story, it got to its last quarter almost where there is a fast and promising end. The story is not really predictable too. However, this is because it seems more of a bits and pieces woven together along with revealing important facts at continuous times. Yes, the plot really lacks the spark and the story is a simple one with no major twists. Though, by the end, the stage has been set for the sequel (Into Darkness) and you can hope for a better plot along with more character involvement. The trailers are certainly promising.<br/><br/>Hoping to see Cumberbatch at his best in the next one. As far as this one is concerned, see it for its action and sci-fi and let the story build for a bright future. For me, its an 8 due to lack of plot and lack of character (emotional) involvement-->a part where I hope but do not expect much in the next ones too."
"theredraylives","9","0","1","20 May 2013"," Good sequel, better reboot, all-around triumph
","Star Trek is a series that could keep going forever. It has seen so many incarnations, between television, movies, comic books, and the like, and each bit has added just a little bit more to the vast canon that makes it up. So rebooting a series such as this- returning to the crew that started it all- was sure to be a difficult task. Enter writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and director J.J. Abrams with a fantastic idea to not only reboot the series, but to create a sequel to it as well, to pay homage to the immense canon that came before but give the franchise a future free of adhering directly to it. With this they were able to create a fantastic film that captures the heart and camaraderie that always lay at the heart of Trek, and a great sci-fi action flick to boot.<br/><br/>Star Trek begins as a sequel, with a Romulan vessel piloted by the mysterious Captain Nero (Eric Bana) arriving out of a black hole in front of the USS Kelvin. They immediately attack and cripple the ship, leaving first officer George Kirk (a not-yet-Thor Chris Hemsworth) in command with his wife (Jennifer Morrison) giving birth to their son. They are tragically torn apart when Kirk must take the Kelvin on a collision course with the Romulan ship; the last sounds he hears are his infant son, whom they decide to name James.<br/><br/>The film spends its first hour growing with- and exploring the dynamic between- James Kirk and Mr. Spock (Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto). Abrams and his team assembled a brilliant cast here, the heart and soul of which are these two characters. Pine and Quinto do more than just impressions of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy- though there are clearly hints of the two in their performances- but they strive to truly connect as Kirk and Spock, be they friends or adversaries as the film continues. Pine and Quinto take the immeasurable mantle of these two characters and they wear it incredibly well- fantastic performances both.<br/><br/>The rest of the crew rounds out and is introduced as the film goes on- from Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Bones (Karl Urban). Each of the cast members does a great job in their respective roles, particularly Urban as Bones, who steals every scene he is in. Less effective is Simon Pegg as Scotty- he is a great actor and adds some good comic relief, but his Scotty is less an engineering genius than a sideshow. The film needed some comedy, and between Bones and Kirk it has plenty- Pegg's Scotty practically grinds the film to a halt every time he is on the screen.<br/><br/>Another weakness of the film is Bana's Nero, who is an utterly dis-interesting character and a lackluster villain. While his anger over the destruction of Romulus is understandable, and his motivation fitting, he gets little to no development. What happens to him after the destruction of the Kelvin? How does he know what happens to Spock and where to find him? Too much of his story ends up on the cutting room floor, and it's a shame. Five more minutes of screen time exploring Nero would have benefited the film greatly.<br/><br/>Despite these minor flaws, however, the film is a triumph. Beautiful special effects and spectacular actions sequences, and a small role for Leonard Nimoy as the time-traveling Ambassador Spock- this film quite literally has it all, tie-ins and homages to old Trek while paving a new path for itself. Particular credit has to go to Abrams and his screenwriters for focusing so strongly on character, and the interactions between them. At its core, Star Trek is as much about going ""where no one has gone before"" as it is about the limits within all of us- indeed, our very human nature. More than that, Abrams has taken a franchise that once alienated all but its hardcore viewers and made it something accessible to a massive audience- and from here, Star Trek has no limits. Truly, the franchise will now go where it has never gone before, and a new generation can grow up with Kirk, Spock, and the Enterprise in the same way their grandparents did."
"illbebackreviews","10","0","3","18 May 2013"," 'The Matrix' of the 2000s- Simply mindblowing in every aspect.
","Reboots often do not work simply because no level of respect or homage is shown to some of the previous installments, but JJ Abrams made Star Trek in a way that every film with the original cast of the 80s and 90s were relevant and simply occurred during that time. Now, that is purely brilliant! By now, I've come to strongly dislike The New Generations films and have strongly disliked 2 of the old crew films. Star Trek is one that, not only do I enjoy, but I just love it so much. Currently, I am making a top 25 favorite films list and had I not being half done, Star Trek would make a place in my top 25! Spoilers throughout: Star Trek begins with a sequence regarding James T. Kirk's parents, who are aboard a spaceship called the Kelvin, which is suddenly under attack by Romulans following a lightning strike in space. George Kirk, father of James, is put as captain of the Kelvin and within the 12 minutes of captain, he saved the lives of 800 people by allowing them to escape whilst taking his life to defend them. In this ensuing chaos, James T. Kirk is born and his mother is able to escape. This was ""the"" perfect start to a Star Trek film, carefully and brilliantly telling us a little about how Kirk was born and what his father was like. This makes all the more sense and all the maturity into previous installments when we realize that Kirk is actually attempting to live up to his father's heroics. This sequence was the perfect way for JJ Abrams to have his audience completely engaged in the story by providing amazing visuals and action scenes and extremely well done storytelling.<br/><br/>'Star Trek' then tells the story about James T. Kirk who tries to live up to his father's legacies and become who his father would've wanted him to be whilst Vulcan Spock decides to not attend the Vulcan Science Academy, regardless of his extreme wisdom, but instead attend Starfleet as an officer. This was fantastic! The scenes with Vulcan early on were absolutely necessary and brilliantly done, paying complete respect to Spock from the earlier films and TV shows.<br/><br/>If this film has any issue for me, it is actually the villain who is definitely a tad weak and not extremely threatening. Thankfully, this is made up by fantastic writing and direction, mindblowing visual effects and action sequences and an extremely emotional storyline that dwells deep into the characters of Kirk and Spock. Whilst everyone liked Spock and Kirk from the old films, never was there any depth to the characters to this extent and so, when JJ Abrams decides to add extreme depth to his characters, it could either work or not. In this case, it worked and worked brilliantly.<br/><br/>Though for most of the time, I regretted watching every previous Star Trek film, by now I am completely pleased by this. Not only does it flesh out the characters more but it makes for a more mindblowing and entertaining experience. None of the other Star Trek films were this fast, this action packed or this mindblowing for its time period. However, the best thing about the film is the relationship between Spock and Kirk, who are portrayed absolutely brilliantly by much younger and much more active actors, Zachary Quint and Chris Pine. The way they become friends throughout the course of the film is done extremely well and in a realistic manner as is the rest of this film. More specifically, one of the best aspects of the film is how JJ Abrams had a character called 'Spock Prime' who is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy from the old Star Trek films. This character was extremely interesting and the way they incorporated him as a man from the future, which clearly tells us that the events in 'Wrath of Khan' take place due to the fact that Spock Prime recites the lines ""I have and shall always be, your friend!"" Lines that are direct references to Wrath of Khan, my second favorite Trek film, were a delight to be heard in this film! If any director needs to learn how to reboot a film, it is most definitely essential to get a tutoring class by JJ Abrams, who has successfully turned a slow and vastly inconsistent film franchise into an epic reboot that is much more lively, visually stunning and action packed. Every actor does play their part really well, even those such as Simon Pegg and Zoe Saldana. Star Trek is most definitely my favorite movie of the year and one of my top 5 favorite films of that decade."

","Full of plot holes, bad science, and inconsistencies... just like the originals! NOT faithful to the original, but they already said it was going to be a reboot, so that was expected.

Even the originals were full of the same things, but the difference was that they were the originals.

"jgrabo2035","9","0","1","24 March 2013"," Not your father's Star Trek
","J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek"" represents a new genre of filmmaking: part reboot, part prequel, part homage. The film's opening sequence takes place on the day of James Kirk's (Chris Pine) birth, with the tragic death of his father as he battles an unknown alien ship. Any fan of the original series immediately recognizes that this isn't a normal reboot of the franchise, as Kirk has always been known to have a close relationship with his father. The viewer is then left in a sense of wonder and intrigue trying to figure out what kind of film this will turn out to be. The plot centers around the young crew of the USS Enterprise, with familiar characters with new faces: Bones McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and Spock (Zachary Quinto) all fresh out of Starfleet. The young crew, commanded by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), set out to investigate reports of attacks by an unknown alien ship. The first engagement with the alien ship forces Captain Pike to become prisoner to a Romulen called Nero (Eric Bana). Through a chance encounter with an aged Spock (Leonard Nemoy) after being marooned on a nearby planet, Kirk discovers Nero was taking revenge on Spock for a future event that lead to the destruction of Romlus. After a pursuit through a black hole, Nero arrived on the day of Kirks birth, forever altering his destiny (and the original Star Trek storyline). Spock was then captured and marooned, forced to watch as Nero destroyed planet Vulcan as vengeance for Spock failing to save Romulen. Nero's plans don't stop there, as he plans to destroy Earth as well. A fast yet smartly paced film reintroduces familiar faces for a new audience and simultaneously paying tribute to past films. Captain Kirk is now more of a rebel, Spock struggles to balance the logical upbringing with his human emotions, McCoy is portrayed perfectly by Karl Urban (thankfully being true to his characters voice pattern and not Pine doing his best Shatner impersonation). The theme of the film is that of rebirth and new beginnings, clearly portrayed as a modern take on a classic series. Abrams signature lens flare seems more appropriate that usual as the shiny and modern deck of the USS Enterprise gleans under its intense lighting. Wide angle shots are used brilliantly to take in the scope and scale of these massive ships. The space scenes are particularly impressive, borrowing from televisions own rebooted sci-fi franchise Battlestar Glactica, the camera is treated as a third person using a hand-held camera to sharply zoom in and out of epic space battles. Also like Battlestar, the themes of rebirth and a new respect for truly dramatic, and less cheesy, science fiction is presented; new love stories, brooding dark characters all while maintaining the fun. The film pays homage to the original series while making the reboot accessible to a new audience. Abrams rewards both newcomers with excellent character development and dialogue while rewarding die-hard fans with the occasional classic Star Trek line, such as Scotty screaming his now famous ""I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain!"" That line truly sums out Abrams efforts to rebirth the Star Trek legacy."

He has the speaking cadence and the sense of Deforest Kelly's original pat with the benefit of today's sensibilities to allow us to see what we knew was in the 60's version. I won't keep going thru the cast but I am pleased with them all. I like some of the tact's that have been taken this time around. The origin of Bones name rather than as a Doctor name which would be typical but from his personal history. I like the way Kirk and Spock end up in star fleet. Look it is a great watch.

","What can one add to a review corpus consisting of more than 1,400 reviews and over a quarter million votes?? <br/><br/>I grew up on this show. These characters, these actors, are a part of my life. Since the series was released in the late 1960s, not only have I seen all the episodes, I've seen each episode multiple times. I'm not an intense fan or anything, but the show was just constantly in rerun and I always enjoyed watching it. It's been part of my life for over 40 years. Even today I have an image of Spock hanging on the bulletin board in my office. This show fed my childhood imagination. You have to really wonder at the burst of creativity that produced the show in the first place and brought those particular actors together. <br/><br/>I haven't seen a TOS rerun on Dutch television for quite some time (perhaps ten years or more?) Nor is it shown on the international cable channels. Even the Syfy channel doesn't show them. I think most young Europeans have never seen a TOS episode. And if they have, perhaps it was just a few. I'm sure the more alert ones are aware of the TOS as a cultural phenomenon, but they may not understand the true extent of it.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie for the first time, it was in a Dutch theatre filled with people in their late teens and early 20s. How many of them really understood the references to Star Trek TOS? It's amusing to me to think of all those moviegoers watching this movie for its own sake, and enjoying it, but not really understanding this entire rich layer underneath.<br/><br/>It's clear that the director and writers went to some trouble to recreate the look and dynamics of the actors from 40 years ago, but imagined about ten years younger than in TOS. I must say that they succeeded spectacularly. For me, this is what the movie was all about. Abrams, Orbi and Kurtzman, and the various actors involved, are not even old enough to have seen the series from the beginning. They must be geniuses.<br/><br/>I like the fact that the individual actors each added something different to their characters. Of course, it doesn't have to be (and cannot be) exactly the same. Perhaps it's impossible to recreate Star Trek TOS as it was. It's a new age. Indeed, many doors slide open now. We all have communicators now. Movie-making has changed too.<br/><br/>The plot was rather complicated, as you can see from the length of the synopsis. I cannot say that the plot itself was that original or amazing. This was not the strength of the movie. <br/><br/>Also, the film was rather too filled with ponderous space scenes showing the time gate and the various ships. Now that they've revived the original characters, I hope they are able to return the movie franchise to concept-based themes and the wry dialogue of TOS. TOS was ultimately a drawing-room drama with ensemble acting, not a Star-Wars thriller. One of the strengths of the show was occasionally using the future to cause the viewer to reflect on present day issues. The last thing this should develop into is a series of huge Avenger-style action movies. TOS blew us away for different reasons. <br/><br/>It was really great that they were able to integrate the older Spock character into the movie. (Neither the new Spock nor the old Spock were exactly unemotional though, were they? We all know the Vulcans still have repressed emotions, but that's not what they are all about. It's always disturbing when a director decides to show us how emotional Vulcans really are.)<br/><br/>Eric Bana played a different sort of role for him: a crazy, tattooed yahoo thug in control of a monstrous spaceship and with a grudge strong enough to last a lifetime. I thought it was great, and the look really suits him.<br/><br/>They weren't gentle with the franchise. They've created a different time line, so not everything is the same as in TOS. And my god — they destroyed Vulcan! Six billion Vulcans dead in the blink of an eye. We'll have to wait until 2013 to see where it goes."

","As a lifelong Trekkie, I can say with a great degree of satisfaction that this latest installment of the time-honored series was quite possibly the best (though I loved ""The Voyage Home,"" the directorial debut of Leonard Nimoy). But first, let's address the altogether negative comments posted here by cinematic morons of every degree who have never heard of the phrase, ""Willing suspension of disbelief."" The reality is, NONE of the Star Trek motion pictures have made much sense, my moronic friends. One of the most vicious critics blasted the film for copping too many ideas from Star Wars. To that genius I can only say, EVERYONE ON EARTH HAS STOLEN FROM STAR WARS!!! The fact is, there is truly ""nothing new under the sun."" George Lucas stole, if you will, his entire story line from nearly all the great myths and heroic epics ever written, including Homer's Oddessey and The Bible. Are we now to sue him for plagiarism? I suggest you get over it. Where this film succeeded at the brightest level was in it's truly inspired casting. I was rather concerned on who the producer would chose to replace the iconic crew members we have come to know and love, but he succeeded, in spades. This was an example of truly inspired casting, with a superb Chris Pine as Kirk and Zackary Quinto as a phenomenal Spock. But even the Bones character was spot-on, and using Zie Saldana as Uhura was the perfect choice, her sense of female strength in a universe of mostly Testosterone Gone Wild, the perfect counterpoint. If I could offer one nit pick, however, I'm getting a little weary of seeing every Star Trek bad guy over-acting, speaking in low, guttural tones, and this latest version sporting more facial tattoos than Mike Tyson. Boring, very boring. Next time hire Gary Oldman, or someone else who can actually act. In short, this was very nearly a perfect re-boot of a timeless classic, and I can't wait to take the next voyage."

","I am not a Trekkie even though I followed the series and watched the films. I've watched this particular instalment of Star Trek 5 times already (for various reasons, sometimes not by choice...). I found myself enjoying it immensely every time. It's true that some coincidences and conveniences are somewhat far fetched. You might find it difficult to enjoy the film if you find yourself hung up on them to much. I didn't have a problem with it. I let my self be entertained by fast paced action. Star Trek, and most science fiction films, have to work on the far fetched to begin with so I'm OK with it.<br/><br/>Response to some of the criticism I've read:<br/><br/><ul><li>Hard core Trekies may have a hard time ""swallowing"" the alternate Trekie-reality in which the film is based on. I think this film makes some effort to part from the previous works.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>(spoiler) Why go (Nero) after Spock instead of saving is planet?</li></ul><br/><br/>Please, Nero is deranged. I think the plot establishes that quite well. He goes after Spock for what he believes to be a just revenge. Also, they are 25 years (?... don't remember exactly anymore..) away from the event, which means that there is ample time to deal with Spock AND try to save his planet. Of course, if he manages to prevent the disaster then he won't go back in time and the paradox of time travelling is set. This is why time travelling in films (or anywhere for that matter) is never consistent and leads to holes in plots. If you have a problem with time travelling in films, stay away from this one."
"stevengiles95","8","0","2","29 July 2012"," Plot, and Theme of the movie
","Star Trek (2009) is a known film about how a young troubling boy James Kirk (Chris Pine) had a dad who was a great leader as Lieutenant Commander George Kirk. His dad was known for saving the lives of hundreds of people and sacrificing his own life in the process. Years later when James Kirk grew up he was involved in a scuffle at a bar where he met some members of a Starfleet and was convinced in going to Starfleet Academy to start a career. Years after being in Starfleet Academy he was found of cheating on one of his test by Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). During the debate on Kirk's cheating, there was a distress signal coming from Vulcan and everyone at the Starfleet Academy was mobilized for the distress call. Kirk was on the USS Enterprise with Spock and when they arrived at Vulcan had found out everything was destroyed by a Captain Nero (Eric Bana) and it was a trap. The Captain of the Enterprise was taken as a hostage and was left up to Kirk and Commander Spock to save him. In result they did save the Captain and ended up destroying Captain Nero's ship in the process. For James Kirk's acts of bravery and fortitude, he was awarded the rank of Captain and leader of the USS Enterprise with Spock being second in command.<br/><br/>The overall theme of this movie was how a young man not experienced at anything was able to show acts of valor and bravery, risk his own life in the process, for the well-being of the others that he cares about. James Kirk showed how his acts resulted in a betterment of his own life, while showing other people of what they are capable of and how to achieve goals in life.<br/><br/>The camera angles that were done in this movie were well thought of, and were the best angles that a movie could have. There were some scenes in particular where the characters had to be rescued by a type of beam that one of the workers on the Enterprise had to operate. There were all sorts of different camera angles when one character had fallen, and Kirk had to jump after that character to rescue him. There were many horizontal and parallel cuts in this seem to make it look as realistic as possible, as if they really were falling. To me this was a great job by the director to help the audience be involved with the emotion, while also keeping the audience ""on the edge of their seat.""<br/><br/>Another scene where lighting was an important aspect of the movie was where Spock had to find his family on their planet and rescue them. It was where Spock had been ""beamed"" off of the ship and onto his family's planet. The lighting was great because it allowed the character Spock to make it look as if he was faded out and put somewhere else. This was an important aspect because it allowed people to believe that this is real because it looked real because of the lighting. This to me just made the movie more believable and helped out with understanding it."

","OK, so this is like the 10th million film or series to feature the Star Trek name since William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy defined the franchise in the original series back in the 60's. Well, even though I'm exaggerating that number, there really has been an overkill of Star Trek material since The Motion Picture in 1979. So what does this new somewhat prequel/somewhat reboot bring to the table that makes it worthy of the Star Trek name? I'm sorry to say, I'm not really sure.<br/><br/>There are some things to like about the film. The special effects for one. And the slick realistic Enterprise props, for two. After that, it's not so easy to find things you love or things you really hate about this film. The plot could get a little confusing if you saw this at the theater due to the time travel elements, but since I saw this at home on DVD I was able to rewind and do a double take when things got a little confusing. Once you make sense of everything the whole time travel element actually makes the film much more interesting. Still, as with other films featuring time travel, things do start to get a little bit ""illogical"", if I can quote Spock.<br/><br/>Speaking of Spock, Leonard Nimoy is the only original cast member to make an appearance on this film as Spock ""from the future"", and I must tell you, he is a welcome addition. I also liked Zachary Quinto's performance as ""present day"" Spock. Maybe having the ""original"" Spock on the set was an advantage that Zachary had over the other actors. While Chris Pine did nail some of Shatner's mannerisms as Kirk, I just didn't feel like he was convincing enough in the role, and that goes for rest of the leading cast members. It's not that I expected them to be carbon copies of the original cast members, but I did expect them to be believable in their roles; however, most of the performances were just mediocre, forgettable - and that's the biggest problem with this movie. I get that it's a modern film, so it's never going to have the feel of the original series with its cardboard-like props or even the first set of movies that revived the franchise three decades ago. But good acting transcends time and this cast just wasn't compelling. Even the villain, Romulan Captain Nero played by Eric Bana, was tired and boring. It's actors like Ricardo Montalbán who played the villain Khan in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) that made that movie the hit that it was back then and classic that it is today. We'll have none of that this time, folks! Not even Nimoy's few scenes could save this film from mediocrity. And apparently we missed the whole part where Spock and Uhura had an affair on the original series and movies. Well they have one on this film, and truly, they could have left it out. Not that I'm opposed to them rewriting the book to make this film different, but if you're going to do it. Do it right. There is absolutely ""zero"" chemistry between Quinto and Zoe Saldana (as Uhura).<br/><br/>The film's other issues are the mediocre dialogue and the worn out plot elements that we've seen time and time again. Ex. - Is there ever going to be another modern action or sci-fi movie in which one of the main characters (in this case two of the main characters) aren't trying to avenge the death/murder of a loved one? Or did you really think this sci-fi (or alien) movie wasn't going to involve a plot to destroy the Earth by the villain? And did you actually think the main character (protagonist/hero) wouldn't save the day (and the Earth)? In a nutshell, the movie wasn't horrible, but after seeing it, I can guarantee you'll forget much of what you saw in the ""not too distant future"". And I don't have to be a time traveler to know that."

","I was not a big fan of JJ Abrams, but always been drawn to his movies, be it Super 8, or many others. Recently, I have come to understand that world has run out of stories, and its quite true, we have seen every kind of movie that can ever be. What makes JJ Abrams great is the fact that he is trying to tell the same old stories in a completely different way through subtle nuances and techniques that produce a kind of strange/awed feeling while watching them.<br/><br/>Star Trek, I have to say, is a solid franchise. Something we have to be proud to be making films on. And who could be better than JJ Abrams? None. But, the film wouldn't have been so good if not for the Special Effects, Music and all other departments collaborating properly.Casting was great. Music was top notch, and acting was good too. Zoe Saldana was HOT. All pieces fell together into places.<br/><br/>The story is well, something, we all know. But, the treatment is fresh. Kirk and Spock share a very good chemistry on screen. In 1990s and 80s it was Star Wars, Aliens which captured our imaginations, in SCI FI genre, and maybe ET too. But, this film could well probably be the Star Wars for this generation, only if the continuing parts are well made."

","This movie has been out for a couple years and, being the Star Trek fan I am I had reservations about even giving it the time of day. I finally watched it today! I had those reservations because Rick Berman has gradually gone farther and farther from Roddenberry's vision, ending with the horrible Enterprise series. Voyager was far better, but not by much.<br/><br/>Berman bowed down to pressure to make the series more sexy and likable to young boys, thus the transition to believable smart women to over-the-top sexuality.<br/><br/>This movie didn't suffer from that at all. It got back to its roots in most ways and really effectively portrayed how a lot of the early Enterprise crew might have been in their youth.<br/><br/>I wasn't overly impressed, but I was still impressed!! 8/10!"

","The plot, story line, acting, all were great, I think Gene Roddenberry would have been proud. However, since this was a tale about James T. Kirk and the crew of the original Enterprise NCC-1701, I think the set dressers should have used the original series' sets rather than modernize the Enterprise. Aside from that, I loved the reference to Captain Johnathan Archer's (Star Trek: Enterprise) ""prized beagle"" (Porthos). Set changes for NCC-1701-A through NCC-1701-D are okay as they are different ships, but there was only ever one NCC-1701. I also didn't like that the Romulans were all face-tattooed and beard-stubbled, kind of like Chakotay from Voyager with respect to the tattoos (Chakotay never had beard stubble).

It was interesting to see everybody's back story as well as the crew banding together for a common cause.<br/><br/>I loved the casting. I thought Chris Pine, a very handsome leading man seen in ridiculous romantic comedies, was well cast as Captain Kirk. He portrayed a cavalier, arrogant attitude that we've all grown to love. Simon Pegg was hilarious, and Karl Urban was actually my favorite as Dr. McCoy, who comes off as a bigger dick than House. Of course, Zachary Quinto fit the role of Spock like a glove, and we see that Spock does have a sense of emotions and empathy, even though he doesn't show it.<br/><br/>The special effects were awesome, soundtrack was beautiful and the story was great. As for Zoe...I know I said that she played a icy frigid bitch. I take that all back. I take back all the smack talking I said. She's actually a pretty lovely actress.

Never really had much appeal for me personally, then when I sat down to watch the 2009 ""Star Trek"" movie it was simply because it was shown on TV.<br/><br/>I must say that it was actually a rather enjoyable movie. Mind you, I am not familiar with Star Trek lore and timelines, so I have no prerequisite knowledge and approach to the ""Star Trek"" universe. So I took this movie as what it was to me, sci-fi entertainment.<br/><br/>And with my slight knowledge of the original series and first couple of movies, I think that this 2009 movie really brought together a really nice prelude story to what the older stuff was about. But again, not being a Trekkie, I have nothing real to compare the movie to, as it is only entertainment to me.<br/><br/>They had brought together a really, really good ensemble of people for the casting of the various roles in this 2009 movie, and people were doing really great jobs with their particular roles. Everyone really brought something unique to the movie, and I enjoyed the way people brought their characters to life on the screen. I have always, however, found Vulcans to look comical with those ears and goofy haircuts, and was laughing as they still have that look in the 2009 version. Truly epic!<br/><br/>The effects in ""Star Trek"" were amazingly brought to life on the screen. The CGI effects were off the charts, and I must put my hand on heart and say that I was nearly blown away by the effects. It was truly a CGI galore. I loved the effects in the movie, and those alone were enough to make it worthwhile to sit through the movie.<br/><br/>I found the 2009 ""Star Trek"" movie to be really great entertainment, although it hardly was enough to make me give up my ""Star Wars"" devotion and switch to ""Star Trek"".

","From Lost creator and director J.J. Abrams (Mission: Impossible III, Super 8), many fans of the original and following alternative and spin-off series, i.e. Trekkies, were probably hoping to see how it all started for the original Enterprise crew, well, this film showed us. Basically in the 23rd century, the Federation starship USS Kelvin is attacked by the Romulan mining ship Narada during a lightning storm investigation, Lieutenant George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) taking over briefly as captain, after Captain Robau (Faran Tahir) is killed, and his pregnant wife Winona (Jennifer Morrison) gives birth to their baby James Tiberius 'Jim' Kirk when they are evacuated, while George sacrifices himself. Years later James Kirk (Unstoppable's Chris Pine) has grown up into a trouble making and reckless, and meeting Captain Christopher Pike (Eight Below's Bruce Greenwood) after a fight in a bar he is invited to join Starfleet to follow the path of his father before him. At the same time, on the planet Vulcan, also grown up Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto) is being frowned upon for his high intelligence, and he is discriminated for being half-human and half-Vulcan, but mainly they are unconvinced he could join Starfleet, which is his ambition. When Spock is eventually allowed to go to Starfleet training, he and Kirk meet for the first time, and after a simulated command of a ship, alongside new friend Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy's Karl Urban), Jim is accused of cheating the test. When all the new recruits are being assigned a ship to be part of the crew, Kirk is disappointed that he is not chosen for one himself, so he decides to stowaway on the USS Enterprise, where Spock and Bones, and Nyota Uhura (Avatar's Zoë Saldana). This obviously disappoints Captain Pike, and there is a real dangerous situation that crops up for the Enterprise, and fellow crew members, such as Hikaru Sulu (American Pie's John Cho) and Pavel Chekov (Fright Night's Anton Yelchin), they are all really put to the test. Kirk is stranded on the desert planet Delta Vega after being accused of mutiny, and during an attack by a giant alien animal monster he is saved by a future older Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and he explains to his friend of the past more about the enemy they are against Captain Nero (Eric Bana). Nero blames Starfleet for the destruction of his home planet Romulus and wants revenge, so with this knowledge of the soon to come future, and accompanied by new crew member Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (Simon Pegg), Kirk finds a way back on to the Enterprise. The crew of the ship manage to defeat Nero and destroy the Narada before it heads for Earth, and Captain Kirk takes over the USS Enterprise, with Spock being his second in command, and good friend, and they all travel by warp to the next mission in space. Also starring Winona Ryder as Amanda Grayson, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Deep Roy as Keenser and Stand by Me's Wil Wheaton as Romulan. The cast of younger actors playing the parts we are all familiar with do pretty well, the story has some good moments in it, and the special effects are obviously a big draw as the Enterprise blasts into action, with the many aliens and explosive action scenes throughout. This is the eleventh film in the Stark Trek franchise, and being a prequel to the original beginnings is an interesting move, but it does work well, and you can see sequels following, a worthwhile science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"

","As an original series star trek fan; I was a little apprehensive of a star trek re-make, however after watching the film, I can 'whole-heartedly' say that it was marvelous. I have to admit that the plot was a little 'far- fetched' and not exactly true to the original series; yet it was enjoyable, the CGI was good to say the least and the casting was brilliant (especially Zachary Quinto 'Spock'). Yes there was a little more profanity than I would have liked and captain K appeared at times more like he was out of fast and furious rather than Star Trek, yet it was enjoyable. If you're a 'hard-core' Trekkie and don't like the other adaptations of Star Trek since the original, you may not enjoy this, but if you like Star Trek (or any other science fiction)and want a fun watch; it's a good bet."

","Star trek is a movie that is filmed during the year 2233. In Narada, the USS Kelvin is attacked by the Romulan ship. Lieutenant George Kirk commands that the damaged ship be evacuated, including his pregnant wife who delivers their son James Tiberus Kirk on board. Unfortunately, on the day that James is born George dies. Kirk is known as a troublemaker so he decides to crash the Kelvin against Narada. Time passes and Kirk becomes grown up, he goes to a bar where he meets Captain Christopher Pike and is invited to be a member of Starfleet. Before George passed away, he was looking to find Ambassador Spock, a half human child, on the Vulcan. Ambassador Spock was constantly criticized for his half human nature. The two are first introduced to one another in Starfleet Academy where Spock accuses Kirk of being unethical by cheating on an exam. All of the sudden, they are notified that there is an emergency at Vulcan because they are under attack. They must make a move quickly because there are other star-ships heading to Vulcan including the USS Enterprise. Despite their first rough meeting, Kirk is eventually saved by Spock. Spock admits that he was unsuccessful in creating the black hole and because of this Nero is now seeking revenge. Kirk is now charged with the task of finding a way to save Earth which is the next stop for the Narada.<br/><br/>The main theme of Star Trek is exploring the unknown, in this case the futuristic unknown. In the film, a starship explores new worlds that have never been seen before. There is both action and adventure in this movie. A film with a similar theme would be Avatar because in each film, voyagers travel to a different ""place"" to explore. Both films also show the struggle between good versus evil and also the importance of working together as a team. The two techniques that stood out to me were sound effects and lighting. I thought it was very engaging how the music gave a dramatic effect to the film. Each starship had its own distinctive design. The sounds actually told a story throughout the course of the movie, whether it was a very serious conversation or a battle against the galaxies. Innovative lighting brought out the creativity in a film. The animators did a great job of depicting what a real explosion would look and sounds like in space. Star Trek shows the dangers and excitements of exploring an unknown world with a futuristic twist."
"Jetset971","Null","0","3","22 October 2011"," The casting is the real star of this movie.
","Let me cut to the chase and say the best thing about this sequel was in the top notch casting. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto were completely convincing as the younger Kirk and Spock. Each not only looked the parts but must have done extensive research on the mannerisms and quirks of the older counterparts. Simon Peg gives a delightful impersonation of Chief engineer Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott. I have to give the highest praise to Karl Uban who looked, sounded and for all accounts was the incarnation of Deforest Kelly's Doctor Mcoy. Man, when he was on the screen i was totally sold. The only problem with this movie, ironically, is the plot. It seems so ambiguous and lack luster that it just seems to be there to give the cast something to do. The villain is uninteresting as well. To be completely honest i was just captivated by each of the new cast members take on the familiar old cast members. I just hope when they make more sequels with this cast, and trust me they will, they will put a lot more thought into the plot. Now that we know the new cast can do the job, give them a worthy script."
"BrickNash","Null","0","5","31 July 2011"," Respectful, action packed but classic characters lost in new bland portrayals!
","Films like these are always bold attempts, and particularly hard ones to appease the hoards of drooling fans who expect everything to be perfect down to the slightest detail!<br/><br/>Happily the majority of Star Trek wins this fight. The film has a good pace and an interesting if absurd concept but most of all it's good to see the original characters back in action.<br/><br/>Back in action is a loose term though because unfortunately the characters are there mostly in name only. I really, really despise it when young actors try to 'bring their own thing' or 'do an original performance' with an already established character. Fine if it is a literary character who is open to many forms of interpretation but for something so iconic and enduring as the original Star Trek cast then tribute must be paid and was lost in a sea of lacklustre personalities. Chris Pines Kirk came off the worst, with the actor portraying a pretty standard action lead with nothing really to distinguish him from so many others. Zachary Quinto gave a suitably dead performance which luckily suited the Vulcan personality but was totally outshone by the Magnificent, if slightly slurry Leanord Nimoy. Ultimate cast Kudos goes to Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin for they fantastic portrayals of Scotty and Checkov which were done with both energy and familiarity. Karl urban sits firmly in the middle with his accurate but much less passionate portrayal of Bones McCoy.<br/><br/>Actors note, to imitate convincingly is as great an acting skill as to deliver a superb original performance. An even balance of the two for films such as this are essential, but was lost in favour of actors trying to 'make their mark', saddened even further by Pine's brilliant second long Shatner impersonation at the end of the film. More of that mixed with what he brought to the role would have been a classic. Kirk is Shatner and vice versa the same as all the Trek characters and this can't be ignored.<br/><br/>Effects wise you really can't complain. Lush CGI is abundant everywhere and apart from the Romulan ship being too dark to see most of the time it is still a foreboding and menacing vessel. The same cannot be said of the horribly misused and underdeveloped character of Nero played by the excellent Eric Bana. As a villain he has minimal background, flimsy motivations and zero personality in both look and character to make him stand out. in fact I couldn't really tell which Romulan was the leader most of the time.<br/><br/>The altered reality concept of the film should have been a major insult and flimsy excuse for the filmmakers to change things at will, but surprisingly it is not offensive at all and strikes up a curiosity about what is next while preserving the integrity of the original series.<br/><br/>In conclusion Star Trek is a decent action sci-fi film with much to offer. But bare in mind, it is solidly directed at those who may have never seen a Star Trek episode or film before, and with a fan base that is arguably the strongest in film & TV history the nods to the original are few and far between and these are the elements that just about every Trekkies will be watching out for first."

Nonsense. By prequels standards, this movie is a respectful and well crafted nod to a cheesy TV series of the 60s. And, yeah, the ""timeline erase"" issue. All I can say is: if this movie has saved the Star Trek Universe of movies such as The Final Frontier, Generations and Nemesis, then, deserves praise just for that.<br/><br/>The main problem I found in this movie, is that some plot devices just defy all credibility. (SPOILERS!) So, Kirk lands in some ice planet, ejected by stupid Spock, only to find elder Spock (good to see you, Mr. Nimoy) just a couple miles around, who coincidently has the explanation about the plot. Oh, and Scotty is around there also. That's convenient. And there's more of these.<br/><br/>But aside that, the story is just fine.

Definitely not enough character building. <br/><br/>But my main point is that Burn Gorman of 'Torchwood' fame, should have been picked to play Chekov. He would have been a great young Chekov. <br/><br/>Not sure if he tried out for it, but they should have reached out to him.<br/><br/>I think JJ Abram is over-hyped and it's beginning to show. He never had the golden touch, that has been attributed him. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon's Firefly would far outshine Star Trek but our culture is beyond saturated with old media nostalgia, so there is no room for true gems anymore."

","I basically enjoyed watching this movie. True there were inconsistencies and things that made no sense at all once a person started taking it apart and asking a lot of why and how questions but although I was prepared to not like this film at all I found myself enjoying it - it was a fast and furious romp through an alternative reality with young versions of familiar characters as well as my favourite character from the original Star Trek - Nimoy as Spock and I must say I really liked the new young Spock too. The role of Spock is a huge role to try to fill and he managed it very well.<br/><br/>Like many others I found the incessant flashing and lens flare to be distracting and intrusive and at times downright uncomfortable - I found myself looking away or closing my eyes - the interior Enterprise sets were also very cold and sterile, not something people would find comfortable to live and work in for months and years at a time - harsh best describes the colours and the lighting not only for viewers but also for the performers and the characters they portray. <br/><br/>My major complaint was in casting - 'Asian Americans' are not interchangeable. To cast a Korean as a Japanese character just doesn't work - Koreans don't look Japanese and Japanese don't look Chinese. Surely there are enough Japanese-American actors that at least they could have cast someone from the same race as his character's name Sulu. This in no way is a criticism of Cho's performance. He did it very well. The problem was he didn't look Japanese - there was this mismatch between his name and his face and I just could not get completely past it even with repeated viewings of the DVD.<br/><br/>There are many little things that with subsequent viewings became mostly minor issues for me but on the whole the movie stood up to my basic criteria - was I entertained? And my answer to that question was and still is Yes."

","First I have to qualify myself. I'm only an original Star Trek guy (including the movies with the original cast), I'm not a Next Generation or other brand of Star Trek fan in the least.<br/><br/>You really need four things to make these go, when the characters are so entrenched in our culture - 1) great casting, 2) good plot, 3) good dialogue, and 4) good special effects/action. The casting of the two leads Kirk and Spock are just fantastic, they are better than copies, they are just so damn good. Uhura, Scotty and Sulu, if somewhat different in appearance, are still very acceptable. The only off character is McCoy, but I never felt he was essential to the show and the new guy at least says the same sort of cranky stuff the original did.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is very good, the only problem I have with it (and it gets docked a point for it) is that it invalidates some important ""facts"" from the original, such as the existence of Vulcan and Spock's mother being around. Seems like they could have had their cake and ate it too rather than diverging as much as they did from the original source.<br/><br/>Dialogue is good, while part of Scotty's character was his very healthy look, the new guy besides being a skinny geek gets the brogue and the lines spot on. The special effects are also very good.<br/><br/>Nice effort, let's see if the studios do what they usually do, drop their standards on the sequel and end up with trash for Star Trek II. But a very nice first effort."

","Owing to the six Star Trek movies and the voluminous Star Trek series that have come out over the past few decades, it is fair to ask whether the latest Star Trek movie (which starts this story all over again) has anything new to show us. What director JJ Abrams has demonstrated with this film is that the answer is a definite yes. There are many things I like about this new Star Trek. To begin with, the film looks great. I have grown really tired of the fake-looking CGI that George Lukas employed for his last three Star Wars movies. So I was pleased when J.J. Abrams actually presented us with realistic looking images. The spaceships look like real spaceships in space. The planets with alien monsters look like real planets with real alien monsters and not something designed by a computer. Compared to Lukas' last three Star Wars pictures and Peter Jackson's gargantuan insects in King Kong, the alien life forms in this movie are constitute a remarkable technical achievement.<br/><br/>The other great thing that Abrams, the producers and the writers did in this movie was to make the characters more human. Chris Pine's Jame T. Kirk, for example, is a lot more interesting that the stock character that most Trekkies grew up with. On the hand, this movies' Kirk is a dare-devil and a bad boy who often gets himself into a lot of trouble and is a bit of a lady's man. On the other hand, Kirk happens to be brilliant and has natural leadership skills, though the question of whether this potential will be realized is by no means certain. Zachary Quinto's Spock is also more developed than the old Spock in the sense that he is presented as more human and flawed and not simply as a caricature nerd. Moreover, Spock is shown to have more empathy as demonstrated by his ongoing relationship with one of the crew. By doing this, it is now possible to relate and sympathize with Spock.<br/><br/>Finally, I found the story to be quite interesting for the first two-thirds of the film. The last third is more problematic. To begin with, this film drags on for too long and could have been trimmed by 30 minutes or so. The other problem with the new Star Trek is that it falls into many of the sames traps as many Hollywood films do. What strikes me is that in a futuristic age, the best that the writers could come up with is a mundane and quite boring physical confrontation between James Kirk and the evil Rumulin at the end. Then there are the pathetic celebratory scenes at the end which come from the same Hollywood mentality that was behind ""Independence Day"" and ""2012."" Since most of the beginning of the film was quite good, I would have to attribute the last third to a case of writer's block and innovation fatigue. It is regrettable, because the set up was quite good and the story was quite interesting most of the time.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"DarthBill","7","0","4","1 October 2010"," Fun if slightly fan fictional
","PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: When a blood thirsty Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana) and his crew arrive in the 23rd century, they set off a chain of events that will drastically alter the original Trek time-line as fans and casual general audiences knew it, and could possibly jeopardize the chance of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) to become the hero that fans remember him being in the original series.<br/><br/>As an adrenaline fueled summer thrill ride, the film works very well, packing all the action that a 21st century can buy, and a mostly well rounded cast keeps you invested. Zachary Quinto in particular is a bullseye casting choice to be the new Spock. True he doesn't sound like Leonard Nimoy (who stars as ""Spock Prime""), but he looks almost exactly like a younger Leonard Nimoy and he captures the general personality of Spock so well that you don't really care that he lacks Nimoy's distinctively deep, gravelly voice.<br/><br/>However there are some things holding the film back from true greatness. As another critic pointed out (more than several others I'll bet), the young Spock leaving the young Kirk marooned on the ice planet (a reference to Hoth in the Empire Strikes Back) would undoubtedly have landed the Vulcan science officer in all kinds of hot water, even if Kirk was a pain in the ass to deal with. Then there is another matter - Kirk becoming Captain without logging in any actual pre-captaincy hours. I can believe that Kirk was a trouble making brat who then grew up to be an angry young man so drunk on his own arrogance and self-pity that he just doesn't care who he offends or who he hurts, and I can even believe that Kirk and Spock initially disliked each other when they first met, but Kirk becoming a Captain when he hadn't even logged in any real work hours is a little too much to swallow. This is the kind of writing that gives fan fiction a bad name. Does Starfleet have no command structure? Surely there must have been older, more experienced officers just waiting to get the green-light for captaincy. We can only speculate as to how JJ Abrams will address this in the sequel.<br/><br/>On the whole an entertaining venture, but will probably play better for casual moviegoers than die hard Star Trek fans."

","I will firstly make it clear that I am female and in no way shape or form a fan of star trek before the release of this film. The fact I knew absolutely nothing about the star trek franchise made me a little cautious watching this film as I believed that I would be confused as I did not already have a background knowledge.<br/><br/>The film however did a great job of covering the basics of what needed to be known. The opening scene containing the birth of the main character (Chris Pine) was well tied in to the rest of the storyline and I did not at any point feel particularly confused by who anyone was or why anything was happening (which I expected) However One thing which I found particularly irritating about the film was the huge time gaps, at one point they skip forward 3 years and I think it would of been useful to include at least a brief showing of what this time period contained.<br/><br/>Aside from that though, I did find this film thoroughly entertaining, and found the cast, settings, music and storyline all very well constructed.<br/><br/>I will definitely be interested in watching a sequel if it is released."
"RemoteControlled","7","0","3","4 July 2010"," They stole so much, they might get sued.
","Now I am not a serious Trekkie, I just watched every trek there was, (excluding most of ""Voyager"" which was too painful). As a true consumer of the franchise, I went in there, no expectations, and got out in a state of weirdness...<br/><br/>I can be incredibly critical of the movie. Especially the writing. Plot, logic, ethics, physics, time, space, they all are so full of holes you barely see the cheese. <br/><br/>**** HERE BE SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>I hope you don't need federation's advanced morality not to maroon someone you simply disagree with on a dangerous freezing planet to be eaten by monsters. It something you cannot do in Star Trek and reality. Having Bones say ""... throwing out Kirk was probably all right"" is just a dumb writer ducking from the shoe. Whilst pretty, the visuals, cg and even their styles are completely and utterly stolen from other SciFi movies and series. Why have Spock fly around in a StarWars glider? It even *sounded* and fired like a Star Wars glider! Why take away particle beams? Not fast enough?? What is this fluttering light they are flying through? Warp speed in Star Trek is just fast movement and was always depicted as such. Remember stars gliding by? Why these pointless replacements?? I for one have seen too many flickering-light-tunnels already. Detail. OK. But why make a trek movie with star wars visuals, weapons, and sounds? Laziness I guess. Why are future torpedoes intercept able by fire from little energy blasts? I mean that would be much easier with a beam weapon wouldn't it? The villains (yes its the Romulans again, Klingons are buddies, remember?) get sucked into the past, laze around for 20 something years in their gorgeously powerful spider-style ""mining ship"" playing poker, the last three years of it cradling their cataclysmic stockpile of planet destroying ""red matter"", occasionally ripping whole fleets of contemporary ships. And guess what... yes! You are right. <br/><br/>They manage to fail. <br/><br/>The new Romulans having changed from sly devious scheming lanky bastards into rather big, beafy and stupid hulks( I guess they were hit by the same thing as the Klingons, and they don't talk about it...) are only a distraction, Nero being a mockery of a Khan for Spock instead of Kirk. If you search for ingenuity or new ideas in the film, well, you can find some, I'll give a hint later.... ranting on.. where was I? right, villain.. well, he is more of a side plot, a narrative device, if you will, that allows them all to be really really heroic in kicking his ass. At the very least you couldn't get Nero by just ramming his ship with yours. I mean, that even THAT didn't work really makes the tension tangible. It was the last ace up Picard's sleeve! (<-Sarcasm). They get him by sneaking up at his ship and stabbing him in the back. Morse code may be a classic wallbanger, but hide and seek never gets old. <br/><br/>Story depth and mystery like in Battlestar Galactica? Nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>The end leaves a potential for endless amounts of new sequels. Bless you, time travel trouser theory.<br/><br/>Well the reason I gave this any stars: The filming itself isn't it. Hollywood has, over recent years, been hit by an epidemic of compulsive tremor that hit cutters and cameramen right where it hurt. (meaning the eyes and heads of the audience). Old Star Trek productions looked hilarious because people tried to jump around faking a shaking ship. Nowadays you can laugh about examples of trembling camera-work and trigger happy cutters. Sometimes it might be an appropriate dramatic device, but especially in Transformers (pick a number) and this movie they sometimes forget to calm them down, steady their hand and switch off the tazer in their pants for just a moment. It is by far not as bad as in transformers, actually it is much funnier because for some scenes it is so inappropriate.<br/><br/>Why then see this crap? Because of the most important thing they stole. Because the characters is what makes Star Trek feeling like actual Star Trek. And that part was done masterfully. Cast and script range from the deep to the hilarious and interact extremely well. The family feeling at the bridge (once the script somehow got them there together (seriously, just ""beam us up scotty"" might have been more appropriate)), the dialogs the chemistry, all perfect. You don't see character development as such, I would rather describe it as putting various pieces of characters and actors together on screen forming a critical mass and going nuclear. I have never seen a remake with so many puns and allusions pointing at its original material. It is so much fun to experience this movie triggering various memories of old, it dwarfs all the negative points. From Spock's eyebrow(""fascinating"".) over Bones's ranting(""that pointy eared hobgoblin"") to Kirks Captain Chair Thinking Pose(tm), it is all there and also a shovelful of new goodies.<br/><br/>Wanna see a new-style action packed movie for the kids combined with a joyful cocky space ride with Jim, Spock, Scotty and Bones where Spock scores the chick? Grab a beer and the hell go see this movie!"
"talkymeat","8","0","3","4 June 2010"," Without Leonard Nimoy, this would be really good.
","Star Trek chronicles the lives of James T. Kirk and an alien named Spock. There lives intersect when they are both going to pilot school at the same time. Both end up on the USS Enterprise and must try to captain the ship after the main pilot dies.<br/><br/>Most of the characters in Star Trek are interesting and well acted, particularly Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. Both young actors give career making performances and have good on screen chemistry as Kirk and Spock. Also, the rest of the crew including ""Bones"" and Sulu are very well cast and everyone in the movie seems to fit right into their roles.<br/><br/>The action is very exciting and the plot is good up until the biggest quality drop off in a movie I think I have ever seen. Kirk is sent to an ice planet that the older time traveling Spock happens to be living in a cave on. I'm serious, that actually happens.<br/><br/>This older Spock proceeds to interact with the events of this time and tell characters things that will make them fulfill their destiny as he knows it. At one point old Spock goes up to young Spock and tells him ""hey, you should be good friends with Kirk your friendship will really pay off."" Aside from his mind exploding from talking to a older version of himself, why would young Spock listen to him. You can't just tell someone to be friends with someone else, that has to happen naturally. Old Spock then says he is going to go to their home planet and help them rebuild; so apparently their are going to be two versions of Spock in the same time line, how ridiculous is that.<br/><br/>Also, Scotty doesn't figure out the formula for beaming people up, old Spock gives him the formula. That isn't cool, it's cool that Scotty thought it up, not that someone from the future told it to him. Scotty's kooky hairy friend doesn't help matters either.<br/><br/>The idea to include Leonard Nimoy really subtracts from the quality of the movie. I was completely loving Star Trek up to this movie sinking, poorly conceived, terribly transparent plot point. It's extremely obvious that the only reason this was put in is so J.J. Abrams can service the fans of the original series. He thought it would be cool to include Leonard Nimoy and have him reference events from the show. Unfortunately, events are meaningless if the only reason they happened is because a person from the future made them happen.<br/><br/>In my opinion this truly awful idea turns what could have been a classic sci-fi picture into just a pretty good one. Don't believe the hype, this is barely even in the Top 10 of 2009. Hopefully Nimoy won't be in the second one and it will be what this should have been."
"Paynebyname","6","0","2","3 June 2010"," Encouraging but could have been better
","I was a little disappointed to be honest for I'd thought the trailer was excellent and that the films would be a return to the form of the early ones. I thought the characters were well rounded and well played, particularly Kirk and Spock whom I really liked. The supporting cast were also strong.<br/><br/>However, I thought the story was unnecessarily confusing with the time travel angle seemingly created just to allow Leonard Nimoy to be in the film, which he didn't need to be. This is a reworking and the characters were strong enough that you didn't need a character from the old series to validate the new one. If they are going for a refresh they need to cut the chord completely.<br/><br/>Also the trouble with introducing time travel is that you can't help your mind racing ahead during the film and filling in the time blanks. I mean if the Romulan planet hadn't been destroyed when Nero had come back in time, why didn't he just stop the star from going supernova this time? There were also inconsistencies with how one minute they have the technology to beam aboard a ship travelling at warp speed yet to place one drop of red matter in a planet they have to drill from a platform suspended below the Romulan ship on a rusty chain. Small points I know but Abram's had gone some way to remove the lunacy that was in the Mission Impossible series with elements that were at least more considered or explained.<br/><br/>The biggest problems for me though were the continual shaky cam, which I'd hoped directors were growing out of and the regular lens flare. OK it's a cool trick but I think it was overplayed a tad too much. There were times when the screen was virtually all white.<br/><br/>Half the wonder of sci fi films is seeing a directors vision of the future but when you can't see a great deal due to being blinded by flare and then having the camera bouncing all over the place, it can become a little frustrating.<br/><br/>I also found Michael Giachinno's score really intrusive and ill-placed. He can do computer games and TV programmes but I think he needs a little more polish before being let loose on a film.<br/><br/>I know people will say I'm taking it too seriously but each to their own. For me it's just rare that a sci fi film would have great characters but poor action scenes. It's like Iron Man in my mind, great characters and top notch acting but the action scenes and general story a little disappointing.<br/><br/>If people want to see sci-fi very well done with cracking characters, a great script and decent battles (both in space and hand to hand) you really need not look any further than the wonderful film, Serenity."

","I am not going to go into much on the movie because I thought the story was well done as well as the choice of actors. My only problem was the scale of the internal sets used on the ship in contrast to the actual size of the ship. The bridge scenes were well done but the machinery areas and all the dead unused space as well as all structural cross bracing in the middle of the hanger areas are way out of scale for this ship. The ship would have to be the size of the death star. They borrowed a huge manufacturing facility and added a few things to make it more futuristic and called it the inside of the enterprise. Also what is up with all the water pipes and steam shooting out everywhere? Since when is starships steam powered? It made me feel like I was looking at the engine room of the titanic.<br/><br/>I would like to see a sequel to the show but the inside of the ship needs to be more to scale and a little more believable That is the only reason I gave it 7 stars on my review."
"horror_pop","Null","0","5","6 January 2010"," A wonderful Trek film, but not without setbacks
","I admit that being a huge fan of the 1960's original series, I am bound to be a little biased when reviewing the newest Star Trek movie, for better or worse. If you're expecting me to hate this movie, you are wrong; I most certainly did not hate it. However, if you're expecting me to hail this movie as the most perfect installation of the series and praise it to high heavens, you're wrong as well. <br/><br/>Let's start with the pros: the action, something the new movie definitely wins at when compared to the original series. The CGI work was gorgeous and didn't distract the viewer even when there was an abundance of it on screen. The sets were fabulous and the atmosphere of every setting was clearly defined (the high-tech buzz on board the Enterprise and the cave-like grittiness of the Narada, the Romulan ship). The new Trek is definitely a treat to literally see, however, as a note to the director, having almost constant lens flare on screen does not make a movie cool (!!!!). <br/><br/>There are scenes that take my breath away, and these are scenes that can only be seen in the new Trek: for example, the very first scene of James T. Kirk being born, and the death of his father, made me cry. Yes, I cried when I first saw that scene. Also the scenes showing young Spock were closely following what Star Trek canon has already established. The cinematography is beautiful and the music is fantastic. <br/><br/>WARNING: What you are about to read are very specific nitpicks by a fan of the original series. Don't take them too seriously, especially if you're a Star Trek newbie.<br/><br/>My main irk first popped up when watching the trailer; my first thoughts were ""damn, they're trying to make this as EPIC as possible, huh?"" which was not what the original series was about. ""But this is a brand new Trek for a new generation, it's supposed to be more serious!"" Yes, I agree, but when you try your hardest to make it believable and EPIC, it can lose some charm when fans of the original (and viewers who are brand new to Star Trek) view the movie. <br/><br/>My favorite thing to bitch about is the casting, especially the characters of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. This film wasn't horribly miscast, I've seen worse, but none of the main cast were very believable as their characters. Chris Pine is not James T. Kirk; he is Malibu Ken. Though he doesn't suffer the fate of repeating catch-phrases, I did not like this new Kirk. He was made into a very unlikeable character, especially in the bar scene where he just acts like a horny jerk towards Uhura. Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock was... passable. Physically, you can't find anyone better. However, who gave the green light for the scene where he beats up Kirk? Really? You're going to have a character who is famous for suppressing his emotions break apart and viciously attack someone out of anger? I don't care what you do with the timeline, I don't care how you handle villains and heroes, but I cannot accept taking a well-established characters trademark and flushing it down the toilet in a single scene. You. Just. Don't. Do. That. Karl Urban as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy was just painful. When he wasn't forcing that horrible Southern accent out of his mouth he was spewing catch-phrases like no tomorrow. There's a difference between paying homage, and plain ripping off, and whenever I heard him say ""I'm a doctor, not a..."" -line, it came off as poor imitation. The rest of the cast was better than the ""big three"" I've talked about so far. John Cho as Sulu did a great job channeling his predecessor George Takei; Simon Pegg as Scotty was fantastic and I felt he portrayed his character with most affection and remembrance to James Doohan; Zoe Saldaña as Uhura was good, but nothing special; and Anton Yelchin was brilliant as the always eager and young-at-heart Pavel Chekov. I know there are characters I should be mentioning, such as Captain Christopher Pike, but if I start talking about every single character I'll be here forever. <br/><br/>I'll take a special moment to thank the always wonderful Leonard Nimoy for appearing in the new Trek. It was great to see the old Spock pass the torch to the new Spock, and, as always, his acting was superb and he really shined in what little screen time he had. <br/><br/>If it isn't obvious by now, my biggest and only problem with the new Star Trek movie was the casting. However, these are, again, very specific nitpicks. My final judgment is that the new Star Trek really is a fantastic movie; go see it of you're a fan, and definitely go see it if you've never watched a single episode of any Star Trek series. Whatever side you're on, you're in for a hell of a ride."

Instead Abrams aims for a more tongue-in-cheek affair aiming to please both the older and newer Star Trek fans.<br/><br/>All the cast is very good and Chris Pine has a natural aura of likability. However, does he have to be so anti-establishment? The known crew of the Enterprise come together rather too willingly and matter of factly and whilst we have tension between Kirk and Spock the rest of the crew are just swept in to the fold without due friction.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of action, special effects and although the story is rather smart in its black-hole, time travel plot it frustrates on its most prominent point. Why is Nero so embittered by Spock, we never really get a plausible explanation except he couldn't save Nero's planet and thus Nero's wife was killed, is that enough to harbor such vengeance? <br/><br/>Star Trek for me was a fun, tongue-in-cheek film that doesn't take itself too seriously. I can appreciate Abrams directorial position on this and the tight-rope he would of been on to please both the old and new fans.

","I've never been much of a Trekie, so I approached this film with an open mind. All I can say is the Special Effects were incredible. At times the sequences moved a little too fast, so I was not able to truly appreciate the Special Effects. Now, with that being said, here comes the negatives. The story was lame. It did not have the same impact I had when the very first star trek movie came out many moons ago. Remember the Voager thing? It was really cool. This one had some crazy space ship that really appeared to steal the show. My favorite choice for the actors was Karl Urban. I was waiting for the famous ""Dammit Jim"" and I was not disappointed. All in all, it's not too bad. But in this case, great special effects did not make up for a crappy story portrayed by a bunch of unknown actors."

","I, like most people who watched this movie, am a fan of the original series and the various movies/spin-offs that have come out in the decades since, so when I'd heard all the positive reviews about this film, and knowing the director behind it, I was full of hope. And while the film is fun to watch, I found it far too contrived to be really enjoyable. What follows contains some mild spoilers.<br/><br/>The crew's first mission after graduating from the Academy is to respond to a situation on the planet Vulcan. The Captain, Christopher Pike, is played by a 50ish Bruce Greenwood, and his second in command is Spock. Kirk is in his early 20s. When the captain leaves the ship, he leaves Spock in command, who eventually leaves Kirk in charge. Then when Kirk leaves, he leaves Chekhov in charge. How realistic is it to have a 22 or 23 year old in command of a starship? Or a 17 year old Chekhov?? This is where the suspension of disbelief starts. Kirk has zero practical experience yet he's soon in command of the Enterprise. So he's the third most senior officer on board? And Chekhov the fourth at the age of 17??<br/><br/>At another point in the story Spock drops off a troublesome Kirk on a frozen planet, and as Kirk is running for his life to escape the local wildlife, he runs into a cave where Spock (from the future) just happens to be hiding. Realistic? You decide. <br/><br/>Finally, at the end of the movie we pretty much have the entire crew we all know and love together on the Enterprise, all 20somethings (except for Spock). So are we supposed to believe that the whole crew stayed together for 20 years, at which time they would have started their ""five-year mission""?<br/><br/>If you can ignore those three huge suspensions of disbelief, or if you're new to the series and know absolutely nothing about the military chain of command, then you'll be sure to enjoy this movie a lot more than I did."

After its first month of release, however, I was talked into seeing it on the big screen, and although I was wrong about some parts (I actually grew to like some of the casting and performances), I was still thrown off by the poor directing and writing skills of Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzmann that made M:I III excruciating, as well as the costume designs that would have been proudly showcased in Batman & Robin.<br/><br/>The special and visual effects were quite impressive and although the story was a bit hit and miss, the performances of Zachary Quinto and Leonard Nimoy as the two Spocks were the main highlights of the movie, along with Eric Bana's evil performance as Romulan villain Nero.<br/><br/>Chris Pine will leave you gritting your teeth at his irritating and very wooden turn as Kirk, and even convert the biggest Shatner-haters in the world to actually praise the 60's Kirk, and Karl Urban's take on Dr. McCoy was a bit too hammy at times, but also quite enjoyable for most of his on-screen time.<br/><br/>It was always guaranteed to be a box office smash, whether it be hit or miss, but it's really one that could easily be saved for a quiet night-in on DVD."

","Although I have always thoroughly enjoyed the series and followed it on and off through its different incarnations, I have never really been a devoted Trekker or mad fan. (I don't have any of the box-sets, I've never been to a convention and my Klingon is basic Leaving Cert.) This probably makes me the perfect audience for this film – someone who enjoys the franchise but not obsessively so. JJ Abrahms has been at pains to point out he was never a great follower of the show and has proudly boasted of his ignorance of much of its key history – he didn't know Spock was half human for example. This inevitably had the faithful up in arms when the project was announced – a bit like asking a Marxist atheist to make a film about the life of Christ! As it turns out the film has been embraced warmly by faithful and fickle alike – with the fundamentalist hold-outs forming a small minority. The original series never took itself seriously and neither does this film. It is first and foremost an entertainment designed for an audience not for a cult. Having said that it does not simply play it for laughs (although it is at times very, very funny) nor, thank God, does it ever descend into camp. It is brash, exciting, dramatic, fast-moving and just basically damn good. There are also a few sly winks to clichés of the series – the crew's first away mission involves Kirk; Sulu; McCoy and – Oleson. Guess what happens to Oleson. Also there is the thrill of seeing the various long established characters at their first appearance – ""Hi I'm Chekhov""; ""Hi I'm Captain Pike"" etc. and the fun of comparing these young actor's interpretation of roles we're so familiar with in their later incarnations. Karl Urban's Bones McCoy is uncanny while Simon Pegg's Scotty is nothing like James Doohan's (his Scottish accent is too realistic) but still a great character creation in its own right. The film is lifted up also by the appearance of fairly heavy-weight actors in small but significant cameos – Ben Cross; Bruce Greenwood; Winona Ryder (""Hi I'm Mammy Spock"") and of course Leonard Nimoy is in their too."

","If this don't keep the fan-boys happy, nothing' will.<br/><br/>How do you approach a movie as sodden in mythos as the STAR TREK franchise? The approach must be as trepidatious for film makers as it is for geek-boys and weekend viewers alike. Every inch of a production under the STAR TREK aegis would reek of esoterica and legacy. How could anyone possibly circumvent the pitfalls and launch another TREK into warp drive without twisting someone's seven of nine? <br/><br/>Here's how: STAR TREK 2009 - a grand homage to a dubious institution. (Some may immediately take issue with ""dubious"" - but let's be frank, the original 1966 series was no SPACE: 1999; it was cheap, relatively unsuccessful and aggressively fey. The legend has more cred than the product.) <br/><br/>Funny that director J.J. Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have recreated Gene Roddenberry's idea exactly as it has always been - simple story set in space, where English is still the Universal Language, where unknown crew members with different colored tunics always die when they go EVA with the stars, where sparks still fly out of consoles to signify damage being done to a hyper-sophisticated starship.<br/><br/>The homage and reverence of TREK 2009 comes in two parts: Fully 50% is the efx. They've really taken this seriously. The surroundings of the 23rd century are stunning in their detail - Iowa is still a bleak, flat landscape but in the distant haze, hulking city-scrapers loom, rising into the lower stratosphere like ocean liners tipped on their sides; we see the NCC-1701 USS Enterprise in all its maiden glory; jaw-dropping space scenes, which sometimes lapse into total silence during exterior shots, lending the vacuum of space its long-sullied reverential, foreboding air. These latest boastings in special effects technology outdo Lucas - they are the best you will see at this point in history.<br/><br/>The other 50% is the casting. Perfect. Chris Pine is James Tiberius Kirk, looking like Ray Liotta Junior and as fulla beans as we remember the shirtless Shatner; Zachary Quinto is the closest thing to Spock as body oil is to Shatner; Karl Urban channels Bones hilariously, his famous disclaimers scattered passim: ""Goddamit, I'm a doctor, not an engineer!""; Anton Yelchin soft-v's all over the place as Pavel Chekov; Simon Pegg as Scotty steals his scenes (but then Simon Pegg can make even a David Schwimmer film palatable, how could he NOT steal his scenes in a well-made movie?); John Cho (yes, KUMAR) is Sulu; and Zoe Saldana as Uhura spreads her pheromones over Spock like chocolate duck butter.<br/><br/>A fitting re-launch of the STAR TREK franchise. And all thanks to Leonard Nimoy! In a wizened cameo as Spock Prime, he is responsible for some kind of time-paradox-anomaly-panty-twist, so these young characters we see are supposedly the same characters we know - but in an alternate time continuum, forging new destinies.<br/><br/>The irony is TREK 2009 shows us the well-loved TREK characters when they were young, but we've already seen the characters when they were young - and they looked nothing like these guys! Well, except for Spock... amazing what a pair of pointy ears can do.<br/><br/>At film opening, we meet the USS Kelvin, populated by Captain Arab Guy and his crew of Teen Models, under attack from Eric Bana as the vengeful Romulan, Nero, directly tied to the time paradox plot. One of the models is Kirk's father, who makes the ultimate sacrifice for his unborn son's escape, in the film's most touching, human scene, as the mother describes via radio her newborn son - James Tiberius - to the father, as his ship impacts. Birthed during a battle, conflict would follow J.T. all his life like green-skinned babes in space bikinis.<br/><br/>While on planet Vulcan, young Spock, conflicted with emotions from his half-human heritage, is invited to attend Vulcan Academy and declines. For emotionless Vulcans, these guys sure display a lot of emotion - when chastised by the elders, Spock gives the ""Live Long and Prosper"" salutation not in comity, but in sarcasm. Excellent.<br/><br/>The best aspect of TREK 2009 is that it makes the Enterprise crew and the starship Enterprise powerful, not just in reputation - in action. We see Sulu (whose combat experience is in the seemingly innocuous art of ""fencing"") do sword battle like Toshiro Mifune, we see the might of the Enterprise's big guns; we see Spock give the nerve pinch - to Kirk.<br/><br/>Though there is not much space between explosions and stunts for characterization, TREK 2009 explores well, albeit briefly, the conflict between Kirk and Spock over the captain's post onboard the Enterprise, also playing up a bemusing ""romance"" between Spock and Uhura. The plot involves Spock Prime re-booting history by accident and Nero traveling through time to nerve-pinch him, with the Enterprise crew being caught in the crossfire and having to rescue their captain (Bruce Greenwood) from Nero's ship.<br/><br/>And the moment we all wait for: Quinto meets Nimoy and engage in some tasty Spock on Spock philosophy. (Might I make a prediction? Other players in this movie franchise will come and go - Zachary Quinto will be forever Spock.) <br/><br/>Nimoy's closing voice-over is the immortal intro to this immortal series: ""Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life-forms and new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before."" Again."

","Trekkies must be fuming from anger: someone has taken their precious Star Trek, which has been for decades their special little play ground, and turned it into something a regular, non canon obsessed person can actually enjoy.<br/><br/>It's actually quite brilliant: from a future comes a Romulan villain, who is seeking vengeance upon Spock and other Vulcans. He waits for old Spock (the man from the original series, Leonard Nimoy) to come in the past, so Nero (brilliant Eric Bana) can make him watch the destruction of his home world in the past. This all establishes a time line, that is quite different, yet still similar to the old one.<br/><br/>This also give the change to reintroduce all those familiar faces with new actors. James Kirk is played quite nicely by Chris Pine while the role of young Spock has been given Heroes series arch villain Zachary Quinto. It was actually quite a pleasure to see more seasoned portrayal of Nimoy and an role of Quinto, who is still trying to figure out who Spock really is: a human or a Vulcan. And it also was quite nice to see Spock having emotional contact with Uhura (beautiul Zoe Saldana). The rest of the cast is also manned with a great cast, such as Carl Urban as Bones and Winona Ryder as Spock mother.<br/><br/>All in all, Star Trek is very enjoyable, reasonably well written and easily the most enjoyable Star Trek movie for people, who aren't very, or not at all, familiar with the original series or previous movies, which always felt like they were directly tailored to a small core audience."
"etudiantemo","8","0","3","8 June 2009"," some doubts with this film
","I have never watched any Star Trek film and this is the first version I saw. I think it's great. What made me engrossed in is a lot, the visual effects, the twists and turns, the character development and the thought provoking exploration in human or other being's emotion and mentality. To me, navigating is a sublime and purified course as strolling amongst the clouds is romantic and inspiring though it's volatile at the same time. Recently, the plane of Air France disappeared on the Atlantic Ocean and over 200 people were killed in this accident. This tragedy reminds me of the novel, Vol de Nuit, written by a pilot who wrote the universally recognized Le Petit Prince and also mysteriously disappeared with the plane he piloted in an unknown accident. In this novel, the author describes the struggle and agony of the pilots and commander in storms and hurricane, implying that the sense of responsibility transcends liberty. It's admirable. This film impressed me with the same force. Be loyal to your cause, be firm to your own choice.<br/><br/>However, I still have some doubts with the plot. For example, when Jim was exiled to a planet covered with snow where he met Spark from the future, he was told that his father is proud of him because he is a captain. As Spark from the future world said, this future Spark is coming from the world 150 years later. So it follows that Jim and Jim's father are still alive in the world 150 years later, which means at least this two person can live as long as over 150 years????? Another question is that since two Spark can be existing in two different time zone, the wicked Nero shall also have another one in another world?????? Then, why we only see one Nero????? And why this Nero we saw in the film did not come to another Nero for assistance????? And ironically , this Nero was so lucky that he could go back to the past, why he failed to try to avoid the disaster to be occurred to his planet but take nonsense revenge?????? <br/><br/>If the plot is reasonable and that's because I am not smart enough to understand, can anyone answer these questions for me?"

"Argemaluco","9","0","8","5 June 2009"," An excellent entertainment
","When I was young,my holy trinity of TV series was composed by Lost in Space,Ultraman and Star Trek.When the time went by,I kept appreciating the first two ones because of their fast entertainment and the nostalgic factor...but in Star Trek,I found additional levels which made me to comprehend why the science fiction can express interesting ideas and provocative concepts in order to stimulating the imagination and waking up the curiosity of the spectator about the universe which rounds on him/her.So,I have to admit I am a ""trekkie"" who has gone to conventions (without a disguise) and who has seen every movie and every single episode from all the series belonging to this franchise (by the way,my favourite one has been The Next Generation,and the one I have least liked is Voyager).However,I am not one of those fans who take their fanaticism to semi-religious extremes,studying the continuity of the Stark Trek universe and remembering every single detail.We do not have to forget that,more than anything else,Star Trek must work as an entertainment,and when its appreciation is replaced by academic precision,I think it looses one of its main virtues.I think we should take that attitude to analyze the new Star Trek movie,because it works wonderfully as an entertainment.This resulted to be an excellent film for many reasons.First of all,this movie is tremendously entertaining on every scene,so it never becomes boring.This movie does not get the narrative heights from the best moments of the saga,but I do not consider that as a fail...after all,the main intention from the movie is re-establishing the Star Trek universe for a new generation,introducing the characters,their motivations and the relationship between them,and the movie perfectly achieves that.The cast is perfect and director J.J. Abrams obtained amazing changes of rhythm,emotion and tone which,on some way,they do not alter the consistency of the story and of its characters.Besides of that,Abrams shows great talent for generating emotive moments and exciting action sequences.The only fail I found on this movie is that,near the ending,a situation has a forced solution.I will not reveal more because I may ruin the movie to some people.In spite of that,I liked this movie very much.Star Trek is an excellent entertainment,and it left me very satisfied.I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm,because I am sure you are going to have a great time with this movie,being or not being a ""trekkie""."

"ksj870","8","0","7","1 June 2009"," Star Trek Torpedoes the Competition
","Trekkies rejoice! After nearly a decade of languishing on the sidelines while the Star Wars franchise enjoyed a grand resurgence courtesy of a string of prequels, Star Trek fans finally get the rejuvenation they've been waiting for. In fairness, the last two Star Trek features, 1998's Insurrection and 2002's Nemesis, were not nearly as bad as reputation would lead one to believe, and the latter was in fact quite good. Be that as it may, both were big disappointments at the box office, and with the TV series Enterprise fading away sooner than expected, many longtime fans feared the voyages of the Starship Enterprise were at an end.<br/><br/>Not so! The new Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams, is a galvanizing reboot of the long-running franchise that is making big waves with old-school Trekkies and new fans alike. Taking a cue from Star Wars, the filmmakers have taken Star Trek back to its roots to tell the story of how the legendary Captain James Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy, and their supporting cast were all thrown into the maelstrom together for the first time. Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman carry out this difficult assignment with admirable respect for the many storytellers who have come before, and develop the characters and plot lines that are an integral part of Star Trek lore with great care and attention to detail, and Star Trek is full of many subtle (and not-so-subtle) homages to past films from the series.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that in terms of visual extravaganza, the new film blows away all of the previous Trek movies. Special effects have evolved exponentially since the first attempted reboot of the saga with 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and the numerous aliens, space battles, and fantasy sets all possess an enhanced level of visual spectacle. Director Abrams manipulates all the action and drama to great effect, and if he is clearly determined to pay his respects to the movies that have paved the way for his film, he is nonetheless unafraid of taking the story in bold new directions.<br/><br/>But a movie dealing with so many well-loved characters whose individual personalities are indispensable to the Star Trek experience couldn't succeed without some great casting. After all, William Shatner *is* Captain Kirk; Leonard Nimoy *is* Spock. How could anyone else fill their shoes with any credibility? Thankfully, the casting is near-perfect. Chris Pine has perhaps the biggest challenge of all the cast, playing the immortal James T. Kirk, but pulls it off with aplomb and brings to the part all the unconventionality and love of adventure which a young Kirk should have. Praiseworthy as Pine's performance is, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban are even more impressive as Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy, respectively, so much so that it's honestly hard to imagine any actors doing a better job unless somebody actually cloned Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. Both men nail their roles with unerring accuracy. The rest of the cast is for the most part outstanding as well, including John Cho as Mr. Sulu, Simon Pegg as Scotty, and Zoe Saldana as a very sexy Lt. Uhura. The only question mark is Anton Yelchin's Mr. Chekhov—not only does he not look the part, his version of the character is written very differently from the original. But overall, the casting is remarkable.<br/><br/>None of which is to say that Star Trek is flawless. There are some curious liberties taken with the space-time continuum, and the plot relies upon some conceits which don't necessarily hold up well upon reflection. More glaringly, the film's antagonist, a crazy Romulan called Nero, is a rather generic sci-fi villain who, while serving the plot well, doesn't hold a candle to his obvious inspiration, the great Khan from Star Trek II. That film is surely the best of all Star Trek movies, followed by the likes of The Voyage Home, The Undiscovered Country, and First Contact. But if it's not the very best in the cycle, Star Trek is certainly a very good all-round adventure film, and one that has restored the luster to one of the genre's most influential series."

","This is true for the original Star Trek cast as well for my team-up with the kid (our first movie since 4 months). <br/><br/>Although he is 6 years old and discovered the Star Trek universe with this movie, he liked it and it was funny to see that he had understood the colors code for the clothes: he doesn't like the ""blue"" and was worried for the ""yellow"".<br/><br/>For me, I was happy by the choices made by the movie: The young cast is talented and I am amazed how they catch their models traits. The story is an intelligent mix of action and emotions and benefits from the ""beginning"" effect which unveils untold moments so far: how the characters met, what did they do before. <br/><br/>And for sure, i was deeply moved by the two guest stars: one in true light, the other a bit in shadow. It was a great joy to see finally the original cast on a big screen because time makes every one older and this unexpected opportunity was thus a kind of tribute for the good memories they gave me on TV when i was younger.<br/><br/>The Star Trek philosophy meant so much for me that i have always think about a definitive fan fiction which is, to my great surprise, very similar to this actual movie: I toy also with the classic characters, time travel and an alternate reality. But instead of a mere second starfleet career, my ending focus on their sentimental lives. If the iconic trio, Kirk-Spock-McCoy (God bless him!) shared together some unforgettable moment, they have sacrificed the most beautiful gift of live: love ! So, the old trio gather together one last time and go back in time before their meeting to find their love-mate. And cautiously, as in the movie, each one helps the romance of another one: Old Kirk manages it for young Spock, Old Spock for young McCoy, Old Mccoy for young Kirk....<br/><br/>Long live and prosper, juniors!"

","I'm not a Trekkie, i grew up a Star Wars nerd and fought my corner where necessary. With that in mind, i figure i have the right to be picky about what I do like about Star Trek and the original series is just about as good as it gets.<br/><br/>Not disappointed in the slightest, it's a brilliant work on the original characters with McCoy and Spock the obvious standouts. All the familiar facial expressions, catchphrases and mannerisms are back again, just this time it's shiny and not so disco.<br/><br/>A lot of people keep whining on about the reboot ruining established stories, the main thing i got from watching this was far from that idea though - it's not a reboot at all. Nero has come from the future, a future with events that could quite easily have been covered in a story that fits the overall sequence of previous films, but he has has now travelled back in time to in some way avert these events. It's not as if JJ Abrams is trying to retell an old story, he's telling more of the story and, at the same time, breathing new life into a franchise that was quickly going stale (Enterprise? Oh, come on, it was weaker than Mrs Captain Chicken-bone-stuck-in-throat from Voyager).<br/><br/>The work on the effects and textures is breathtaking - the Kelvin roaring along in the chaos of the opening scenes drew me in and it just continued in that rich vein of form. Adversely, the over-contrasted look to the Enterprise' interior gives it a slightly dreamy feel but doesn't detract from the performances or the action at all.<br/><br/>Bana is, as always, fearsomely good and, aside from Pegg's occasional ""Scottish"" accent (sounded Welsh, Brummie and Geordie at points, but there you go)i can't really find fault with any of the main players.<br/><br/>Well worth it and, from a Star Wars nerd such as myself, that's high praise. Took them 30 years to come up with something to beat down Lucas, now he's at the bottom of a slump and this film is towering over him.

","As a person who saw the Trek franchise wither and die of old age over the years, I had no intention of seeing this movie. But the positive early reviews coaxed me out to the theater, and I was pleased but perplexed. This is probably the best-acted Star Trek vehicle of any type (movie or TV) I've ever seen. The actors recapture the original Trek cast nearly perfectly; the only exception is Kirk. And there's the rub. There is no way in any universe that the brave but utterly irresponsible James Kirk portrayed in this film would ever be put in any sort of military command, let alone that of a starship. He needs about ten more years of growing-up before he'd be ready, but the movie makers needed to end the film with him in command to re-launch the franchise. So, it seems they started writing it at the end with him in command, and then worked their way backward.<br/><br/>The result is a nonsensical, forgettable plot that overwhelms the viewer with explosions and fast-moving objects, but which nevertheless does its job of introducing the characters and throwing them together on the same ship by the end. Luckily, the actors transcend the script and turn in great performances that leave us wanting to see them again very soon for more adventures. And since the writers won't be burdened with having to work backward from an unbelievable premise, hopefully the next movie will be much better written."

In film he produced Cloverfield, a film I enjoyed unlike many others, and has directed two, Mission Impossible: III, and one of his more ambitious projects to date, Star Trek.<br/><br/>This new installment starts at the beginning. It follows James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), starting from their youth and jumping into their beginnings with the Federation. Kirk is the rebellious and troubled youngster while Spock is, well, not really Spock. As I am to understand Spock is supposed to be emotionless but here we have someone who gets irritated, shows hatred, and actually shows some interest in women. I won't say who but it just doesn't seem right.<br/><br/>All that aside, the first half of the film starts off great. There is intense action, a good direction for the story to go in, and some solid performances, surprisingly from Pike as Kirk. I thought he would be more like a teenager with pent up emotions and a lot of whining. He was the opposite really. Another great performance came from Karl Urban as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy. He was very on the mark with his character and didn't stray too far from the original McCoy, DeForest Kelley.<br/><br/>Everything was in the right place for a great second half. The villain, Nero, played by Eric Bana, was not too over the top and the conflict was working. Then the film took a turn for the worst, delving into the very dicey and unpredictable area known as time travel. I won't give too much away but needless to say this was something not needed. It didn't completely ruin the film, but it was certainly a let down. It could have gone somewhere different and ended up in nearly the same spot.<br/><br/>The effects were spectacular, but that was expected. The ships were very sleek and true to the original design (I think). My one qualm with the ships was for the majority of the film they were kind of dinky. They had weak weapons and were basically useless. The Enterprise was a little better but still, come on. In this country aren't things supposed to be super sized?<br/><br/>The film finished nicely. It's a perfect jump off point for a sequel, which will most likely be made. Oddly enough, I think I will look forward to the sequel more than this film. As long as the story is good enough and doesn't go too far overboard, there is potential for a really nice looking followup.<br/><br/>This wasn't perfect by any means. There were a lot of scenes that were unnecessary and the characters need to mature a little. That said, it was a solid effort and very entertaining, something a summer blockbuster needs to do. I'd say the film met my expectations, which weren't too high but were slightly above average, and will recommend it for most."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","9","23 May 2009"," Illogical fun
","I'm a sci-fi fan and I was a teenager during the broadcasting of the original ""Star Trek"" television series in 1966-1969, so I devotedly attended showings of the six films featuring the original cast even though most of these movies took themselves far too seriously and the actors became increasingly geriatric. I missed out on the next generation both on the small and big screens, but the chance to see James T Kirk and the original crew back in action was too tempting to miss, especially when I knew that J J Abrams - who has entertained and utterly confused me with the television series ""Lost"" - would be helming this 11th film in the franchise.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. From the very beginning, this is a work with pacing and panache (plus humour and in jokes) that makes it stand part from the early movies. The (approximate) timescale of this back story version is from Kirk's birth to his assumption of command of the USS Enterprise, but we're in the hands of Abrams so we are subjected to both time travel and alternative universes. This is both a strength and a weakness - on the one hand, it enables the director and scriptwriters to be faithful to the Star Trek canon and characters while re-imaging the whole franchise but, on the other hand, the plot is confusing and - as Spock himself would surely be the first to point out - completely illogical.<br/><br/>So suspend logical and enjoy the ride in what is a visual treat with terrific sets and special effects and fine performances from Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock (good to see him as a good guy after ""Heroes"") and cameo appearances from Leonard Nimoy (playing the original Spock) and much-missed Winona Ryder (as Spock's mother)."
"alex-fry","8","0","8","22 May 2009"," A very enjoyable movie, but come on already, Hollywood
","First off, let me establish that I'm a long time Trek fan and even own a few Master Replicas' phasers, etc., but I don't possess a Trek costume. 'nuff said.<br/><br/>I have few issues with this reboot. In fact, I gave it a soft ""8."" <br/><br/>My big beef is that Hollywood continually treats time travel as though it's a piece of cake and that no one comes out mutated or crushed or whatever. In fact, everyone always comes out . . . period. One piece. Here I am and there you are, me in the future, or me in the past. <br/><br/>Examples of time-travel abuse: ""Star Trek IV"" The ""Terminator"" movies ""Timeline"" ""Deja Vu"" ""Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis""<br/><br/>Yes, yes. I understand that it's all entertainment and that it's ""accept the premise, accept the bit,"" but it's all starting to seem like sci-fi screenplay ""deus ex machina."" Just put time travel into the story and thus everything we do in the movie will be a cinch, plus we can bring back some old character everyone loves, blah blah blah. Plus there are never any significant issues with transporting a person through time via what's usually an unstable (i.e. variable) field. A piece of someone's left pinky could get crushed in normal time while another piece goes back three-thousand years to some faraway location while another piece gets transferred to an alternate universe. That all might be impossible, but it certainly seems more realistic. But, of course, that would screw up any story reliant on ""perfect"" time travel.<br/><br/>Time travel is probably the most incredible thing that could really happen, unless we're talking about time travel into another universe.<br/><br/>Sorry. Had to gripe. I was overdue."
"mm-39","7","0","10","21 May 2009"," They had to change it!
","I liked the New Star Trek. The movie differed from the very old TV show. Why? The writers put a worm hole in the script, which cause two different out comes for the characters in the present. Resulting, in the new Star Trek having an excellent plot twist with two Spocks one older and the other younger living at the same time. I will not ruin the movie, but the characters are different with the time space continuum shift. A more reckless Kirk, and more emotional Spock. I bet we get a new TV series spin off from the movie. Worth watching I give the movie a seven out of ten. This movie will create new fan, and old Trekies will find the plot twist interesting!"
"warren-1976","6","0","7","20 May 2009"," Forgettable Fun
","I've never been a huge Star Trek fan. I enjoy the original series for some of its originality and sense of adventure, while most of the original-cast feature films are great fun, sometimes even excellent. Next Generation, it's associated movies and the later TV spin-offs were all fairly lacklustre. Occasionally forgettable guilty pleasures. So in essence, I came to the new movie without too many preconceived expectations. I was happy to see a new and fresh take on the original material.<br/><br/>What we get is a movie that is reminiscent of the best Next Generation efforts. It uses a hackneyed time-travel story, with little-to-no reason or point, except for the excuse to change the paths of the original characters. Unfortunately, it also needed to be a story with some grandeur and mystery, perhaps even a villain who feels villainous. I won't go into the vague and contrived plot, as it would be a futile effort. There's nothing original or interesting in here, and there are too many pointlessly contrived elements to criticise the science (Never Trek's strong point, but at least it used to try and make some sense within its own internal logic, discounting Next Generation onward).<br/><br/>The plot and characters should be of equal importance, however in this case, the plot is simply a device with which to have numerous new 'character building' scenes, since this is a reboot. To some extent this works. It's all fun, vibrant, and enjoyable fluff. There are numerous amusing nods to the original series and films, that often raise a knowing smile and chuckle. The shame is that these nods are in fact the film's strongest selling point. Most of the actors are forgettable, (or in parts too small to make much note, though Ben Cross, Winona Ryder and Bruce Greenwood do their jobs well.) Zachary Quinto fits the role of a young Spock rather effectively, even though he comes over as playing Sylar in another location and time again. Chris Pine is merely serviceable as Kirk, and brings nothing to the role that makes him stand out, other than 'arrogant teen'. Zoe Saldana and John Cho do well as Uhura and Sulu respectively, without making any real impression either. Anton Yelchin makes a memorable turn as Chekov, but unfortunately only because he has been written and played in such an annoying manner. Simon Pegg is fine as Scotty, though played perhaps too much as purely comic relief. Eric Bana as the villain, Nero, could have been played by anyone. The real stand-out is Karl Urban, who makes an excellent Bones. If the rest of the younger cast members had been able to play their roles with comparable weight in a better story, we really could have had an excellent film. He impressively embodies the way DeForest Kelley played the original character, without being a simple 'impression'. <br/><br/>On a separate note, I also have to comment on the soundtrack, which is decidedly lacklustre. The original films often had wonderfully expressive, emotional, dramatic and exciting scores. Sometimes even better than the films appeared to merit, but they always embodied the mystery and grandeur of space and adventure. This soundtrack by Michael Giacchino does little to inspire or even consciously note. Though perhaps it is unfair to blame him, as we do not know what he was instructed by the director and producers to create. 'Bland' is probably the best word to describe it.<br/><br/>The real shame with this film, is that considering the limitless playground the writers had to play in, they chose a very small corner, and decided to huddle in it. The story all feels very limited and small scale, more due to the villain, his reasons and why events unfold, rather than the nature of the action that happens in the film itself. There was also perhaps a bit too much slapstick, but this could be excused if the overall product had been improved.<br/><br/>It may sound as if I hated the movie. I didn't. It's great fun, and it's nice to see space adventure on the cinema screen again. Having said that, this is simply a forgettable and an unfortunately missed opportunity to do something significantly better."
"freaky_dave","8","0","7","18 May 2009"," Very good movie. One of the best in awhile now.
","Star Trek was a fun movie. THe casting was well done, and the adventure and special effects just as well. Like with his popular TV series Lost, J.J. Abrams uses the time travel gimmick to start the new Star Trek series from scratch by using a time loop that changes all the events that occurred in the earlier TV show and films. In this way, he doesn't have to follow the older Star Trek which was becoming long in tooth anyway, but of course all of the same characters from the series and movies do indeed return. It's a clever idea that works.<br/><br/>After an extended and well done prologue which gives the new series reboot its own beginning, the main characters are introduced and the action quickly begins. You see an angry ROmulan (Eric Bana) from the future, whose ship was forced through a black hole which brought him back in time, is seeking vengeance on Starfleet and Spock for not being able to help save his planet from being destroyed. He is hell bent on destroying all of Starfleet and Vulcan because of this, and so it is up to the USS Enterprise and its much younger crew to stop this from happening. On top of this, SPock and Kirk do not see eye to eye this time because the the future has been changed from what it should've been.<br/><br/>THe cast was perfectly selected. CHris Pine as Kirk is funny, witty, and a rebel of a sort. He also looks a little bit like a young William Shatner. Zachary Quinto as Spock was right on target as well. I sort of like him more in this role then as the evil Syler from the TV series Heroes. Karl Urban was perfectly cast as Doctor McCoy and has a lot of fun dialoque which showed that he enjoyed this role. Simon Pegg plays Scotty, and he has the voice and mannerisms down to a T. ROunding out the cast of the USS Enterprise is Zoe Saldana as Nyota Uhura, John CHo (from Harold and Kumar) who plays Zulu, and ANton Yelchin who plays Pavel Chekov. THe last three don't get much time, but Yelchin uses his Russian accent to the extreme to make his scenes funny and a riot. CHo gets and action scene where he gets to wield a nasty blade, and Saldana gets a little bit of dialoque to show what she has. All the characters are never overdone by the fantastic special effects, which is a very good thing. I only wish they could've done more with Eric Bana's part as the avenging Romulan because it really could've been a more interesting role.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about those special effects. They blew me away. THe Romulan ship was one nasty looking thing, and the Enterprise itself looked fantastic among many other things. Of course, like I said above, the special effects never out do the characters and story, and that always makes for a much better movie.<br/><br/>Other than not giving the Eric Bana character much to do but shout and be angry, Star Trek is a very intense experience. I enjoyed it immensely and would suggest you see it in IMAx now before it is gone because that is the best way to see it. I grade this movie as a B+ or a high 8 out of 10."
"CrassActionHero","9","0","7","18 May 2009"," Breathing New Life Into The Universe
","Star Trek (2009) <br/><br/>Ah, Star Trek. While a short lived t.v. series from the 60's has spawned a legion of fans throughout the years. Perhaps it was the concept, maybe the characters, or maybe leaves people wondering what will the crew encounter next? Anyway you look at it, Star Trek has hit the cinema more than ten times. It's time for another brave voyage.<br/><br/>We have seen a lot of origins lately and now it is Star Trek to shine and finally understand the origins of the original Star Trek crew. This is an excellent character study of the history of the originals. From the beginning, we get already a huge understanding and knowledge of two of our main stars in the first thirty minutes than the entire hour and half of Wolverine, and I still do not know everything about Wolvie.<br/><br/>However, there is more, we learn about Dr. McCoy and how he got the nickname ""Bones"" and I must say that Karl Urban does have a rather strong resemblance to the original ""Bones"" McCoy that I swear they are related. There is Sulu, who is more slick than first thought and get to see Sulu in a different light, not in a bad way mind you.<br/><br/>As if the casting was not enough, what is better is the fact of pure attention to detail. Not everybody is perfect and can make a mistake. There are some genuine moments of good humor here and it is mostly in the delivery of well said one-liners, although the humor is great between some fine interaction between Kirk and Bones early on. Pine and Urban have such fine chemistry. I really can't complain about the acting at all, everyone was in top form, especially Zachary Quinto as Spock.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a success. Everything is explained in intricate detail. We got a true villain and a prime motive to explain his actions. There is a fine level of true emotion felt as I really cared for the crew of the Starship: Enterprise and even though this is a origin story, there are some good moments of suspense too as well as some moments of genuine fear. The level of action is quite awesome. It's slick, stylish, and gave Star trek that extra edge it needed.<br/><br/>This is truly a strong take and a bold one for Star Trek, but it's a solid one. Solidly directed by J.J. Abrams, this is a excellent summer movie. This will appeal to the old trekkies and has the edge and style to attract new fans as well. I know I am now one of them."
"n-rieck","10","0","6","18 May 2009"," It was OK (spoliers)
","I am a huge Star Trek fan and have been watching it since 1966. I am also a huge fan of sci-fi so you'll have to trust me when i say that this movie was ""just OK"". I liked everything about this movie except the basic story plot which means the writers are to blame. Just what did I dislike? ""A small group of Romulan dissidents travel back in time to get revenge against the Vulcans because one of them was late in helping Romulus avoid destruction"". Logically, time-travel should have been used to go back in time to prevent the destruction of Romulus so that 6 billion lives would not be lost and revenge would not necessary.<br/><br/>And what is it about every sci-fi being centered around time-travel? This is one of the reasons why ST:Enterprise failed. On the whole, the story behind this movie is not as good as the ST:TNG episode ""Sins of the Father"" involving the discommendation of Warf to save the Klingon empire. In fact, many TNG stories are better than most ST movies. TNG is the series which gave us The Borg, The Cardasians, The Bajorans, The Ferngi, so why can't movie writers come up with anything new? I am hoping that time-travel in this movie will only be used to enable a reboot into a different universe of stories."

","First things first, i haven't seen a lot of the original Star Trek, although I've seen just about every episode of The Next Generation, and i gotta say, this movie blew me away. During this film, you basically fell in love with the characters, and that's always a good treat for a motion picture. The humour, the action sequences, well, everything was just amazing I reckon. I urge every single one who has doubts about this movie, to go and see it. Because, even if you aren't a ""trekkie"", you will enjoy this picture, and if you are, i think you will enjoy it even more. Of course, there's some commercialism in this film, but I think all in all, that's to be expected, and I won't disregard this masterpiece just because of that. Just be happy that Gene Roddenberrys legacy lives on and continues to evolve!"
"TheTerminatorsky","7","0","6","14 May 2009"," confusing plot
","The special effects were lame for 2009. Looked like FX of 10 years ago. The plot. Well, there wasn't a cohesive one. It was a jumbled mess of time traveling Romulans, and black holes, and something called red matter, and some drill, etc. Then Spock shows up out of nowhere. He tells some jumbled story about a super nova, and him trying to rescue Romulus with his red ball... or some such utterly confusing story. OK, and _why_ is it up to Spock to save the Romulans? What is he the Superman of the future?! Here I come to save the day!!!... It's a bird, it's a plane... no it's a pointy eared 120 year old Vulcan! So why blame anyone for a naturally occurring event? It's like me blaming my neighbor if his house is picked up by a tornado and lands on mine.<br/><br/>So the Romulan ship goes back in time (how I was unable to understand), but instead of warning his planet about what will happen, Capt.Nero sets out to kill Spock... oh, wait, he has to wait 25 years for Spock's ship to appear(for some strange reason). And what did The Federation have to do with any of this? And is that the _only_ Romulan ship that is in space and survives? FAQ: ""IDW published a comic prequel series entitled ""Star Trek: Countdown"" that fleshed out Nero's back story and the reasons for Old Spock's involvement."" How nice. And how are film goers supposed to know that info?<br/><br/>Now, at the end a question was asked as to why the older Spock didn't go onto the Enterprise himself to tell what happened. Aha! The reason is that Capt.Kirk and Spock have to bond as they have many adventures to look forward to... genius!"
"Astralan","9","0","7","14 May 2009"," Grinning the whole time
","When I first heard they were going to do yet ANOTHER Star Trek movie, I groaned in pain. I like Star Trek, but I'm not a fanboy. Actually, my action figure collection is varied... from a Sigmund Freud, Muppet character to Mr. Incredible (Thanks to my family). However I did start musing over the idea, wondering if Archer would be in the Captains chair this time or would they resurrect Jean Luc Picard or James T. Kirk; then the rumors started surfacing about a prequel surrounding Starfleet Academy. OK, Kirk.<br/><br/>But instead of getting let down and annoyed, short teasers started appeared online and my curiosity was prodded. An odd cast was selected that didn't quite strike me as trekkish until cast pictures in full makeup were available. The teaser clips began to reveal more character development, and action. Good. They looked good. Action is good. Familiarity is good. I began to get more interested. SPOILER: The plot involved time travel and vengeance with some very high-tech sequences and stunts. The Romulan world is destroyed and one Romulan blames a member of the crew of the Enterprise and wants all of the Federation to suffer his loss.<br/><br/>That's a pretty tall order, but then again if you have a really big ship (a converted Romulan mining vessel) with some really evil weapons onboard, this no longer is just a fanboy movie, but the making of a good summer blockbuster... and it's going to be a hard one to beat (until Half Blood Prince takes its place). This movie takes its time but it's not slow. The friendships and bonds follow a surprising wayward path yet you know how they end up, the development between Kirk, Bones and Spock being a primary focus. It is amazing how well they honor the original roles and maintain the banter and playfulness of the original series. This release may well allow the franchise to live longer and prosper.<br/><br/>I was grinning the entire movie... that's how it affected me. Even though flawed, it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had since Jackson release his Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yes I said flawed. Every movie has them in my opinion whether it is there as comic relief or totally wrong twist in the plot. Without spoiling it, I felt the placement of introduction to certain key people weren't as intelligently thought out, some lines dealing with time travel were crossed, some weapons were a little too ill conceived if for a scifi future-world as well as many small incongruous details that just may be too trivial to mention here. As a total package though, it works, and delightfully well I might add. As I said, I was grinning the whole time.<br/><br/>I plan to see this again on the big screen which has only happened in a few instances. To truly revive the nearly dead Trek enterprise they will need to continue with this crew and give them something ""trekish"" to pursue. I don't think I could take another TV spin off, but an occasional trip to a theater to see what the crew of the Enterprise are up to wouldn't be totally out of the question."
"martin-w6","9","0","7","14 May 2009"," Generally Excellent.
","Like many I really enjoyed this movie. The pacing is fantastic. Its rare where you get a moment where you start thinking about something else. Its a captivating film for sure. The performances were excellent as were the effects.<br/><br/>I do have a criticism though and thats the enemy. Its sooooo tired. Another bitter angry man who is obsessed with destruction. My real criticism here is the man bit. I am so tired of seeing men in space with stupid colour schemes, enlarged foreheads, weird hairstyles etc. With all those amazing effects I would have liked to have seen an actual alien enemy. Considering the film doesn't even give that much air time to the enemy anyway surely they could have costed some interesting cgi for an enemy. The enemy craft design was rubbish. The enemy themselves were pretty rubbish. Totally disappointed with this element of the story. Also inside the craft it was just dark with lots of wires and stuff and looked so studio'ish.<br/><br/>The idea that every intelligent lifeform has to have evolved from an ape and ends looking almost identical across the universe is so dated its unbelievable. It was understandable in the past where effects were limited but we still seem to be in that mode now. It would have been nice if this film could have broken out of that mindset which was cast from limited budgets and effects possibilities.<br/><br/>So really thats my real complaint about the film I would of preferred it to have tried to move the star trek franchise away from the old rules to a more logical view of alien creatures.<br/><br/>We know how life has evolved and changed with the changing conditions of earth. How gravity, heat, radiation, the chemicals around us and the chemicals we eat can change life. How creatures change with natural selection. I'm sure most people would accept that using those rules will not equal near identical humans out in space with big eyebrows and funny haircuts.<br/><br/>Thats why as enjoyable as this film is it belongs in the same class as an old black and white flash gordon episode.<br/><br/>When science fiction starts portraying humans as the only humanoid type life in space and other species as massively different we will be on the right course. Personally I think that makes more interesting science fiction. The chances of man first stepping foot on some alien world and having sex with some alluring alien goddess are annoyingly slim."

","I'm a Star Trek fan... worn the t-shirts, done conventions etc. There's plenty of media hype around this one and I had confidence that it would be a good film based upon other projects that Jeffrey Abrams has completed. In my opinion, there are two schools of thought regarding where they should go with Star Trek after the demise of the TV series Star Trek:Enterprise (premature, also in my opinion: had they started off with the team that produced season 4, we'd probably still have Enterprise on TV.) One school of thought is that they should stick rigidly to established history and timelines; the other that they should completely re-invent it. To a certain extent JJ satisfied both: for what he delivered was an alternative universe filled with familiar sights as well as substantial history changes. The return of Nimoy's Spock also added some stability to the happy coexistence of Classic Shatner/Nimoy Trek with that of Pine/Quinto. This film was about character introduction and re-invention and the acting standard was at a height never previously achieved in Star Trek films: this sets the scene well for the further JJ Trek films. This was not just Kirk, Spock, Mccoy, Urura, Chekov, Sulu and Scotty in young bodies: they were a believable interpretation on how they would have been when younger. Scotty was the exception who was the comedy element of the film: well portrayed and fun by Simon Pegg. With the effects being very well produced, the only downside was the very poor sound system at the Guildford Odeon screen one. Simple front stereo is not good enough these days: shame on them. In summary, loved the film: True to Star Trek but still new and fresh. Can't wait until the next one but, in the meantime, I'm going top see this one again next week."

"andy_pf","6","0","3","12 May 2009"," Take the good with the bad
","As a Star Trek fan, every time a new Star Trek movie comes out, you're excited, only to be let down. The last 2 movies had poor plots, bad scripts, and cheesy acting. And after The Next Generation, the TV shows went down hill as well (with Voyager being the bottom of the barrel).<br/><br/>This new Star Trek lifts the bar in some areas, but falls down in others.<br/><br/>The plot for instance isn't a strong point. There are too many times when you're left thinking 'come off it' ... there are some really ridiculous plot points and poor clichÃ©s. This may be Science Fiction, but it has to make you believe, and from the whole 'graduates who go straight to captain' to the 'super nova that would destroy the galaxy' or the 'got marooned on some random planet, but luckily, by total coincidence, I landed near old Spock and Scotty' ... it just leaves you feeling like the story was written by some hacks.<br/><br/>On the more positive side, the acting was bearable - a definite plus over some of the previous films (though obviously some of them shined more than others). Nero/Eric Banner was somewhat painful to watch, but the new Kirk was OK, and I didn't even mind Chekhov and his accent.<br/><br/>Where I think the film really stood out though was its cinematography. The special effects were good - but more importantly, the movie itself looked great. It looked like it could be real.<br/><br/>All in all, this felt more like a whole new action/scifi series than a Star Trek. I am convinced we will never get another Star Trek movie that Star Trek fans deserve (action AND intelligence in the plot - something that Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country had, and First Contact almost had). Never the less, at least this isn't both stupid and lame (like Insurrection and Nemesis) ... and if you look at it from the perspective of it being the birth of a totally new scifi series, that just happens to be called 'Star Trek' and have the names of the characters you knew and loved, it really isn't all that bad."
"gstefan-1","8","0","3","12 May 2009"," Nice start but ...
","Without being a huge fan of the original Star Trek series, with James T. Kirk - from which I watched only a few episodes - I came to see this movie as a big fan of the Star Trek: Next Generation series. The leadership model, the courage, the moral debates, the human factor/conflicts were at a central point in the series. The same for the big screen movies. This Star Trek movie does not honor entirely the Star Trek franchise, let me tell you! The plot has many holes and the story seems to have been forcefully adjusted in order to make way for some of the characters. The graphics representing the creatures of the icy planet are terrible and the encounter between Spock and Jim is so unlikely. Many of the characters are under-developed. The action starts to go cold after the capture of captain Pike, and the grand finale reminds me of the flamboyant Star Wars. Should have been better, hotter, more intense ... Having all that to complain about, I still enjoyed the movie, mostly because of the beautiful graphics, the unbelievable start (made my eyes pop ...) and also because of Mr. Nimoy presence (still carrying that 60's Mr. Spock aura). And last, but not least: it's ""I stand relieved"" not ""I am relieved"" - about the final Admiral Pike words upon relieving the command of the Enterprise to Captain James T. Kirk."
