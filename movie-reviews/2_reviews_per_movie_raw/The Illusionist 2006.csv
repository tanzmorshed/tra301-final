"WriterDave","8","361","431","21 August 2006"," This is not a Review. This is only an Illusion.
","""The Illusionist"" is a unique film that combines two often stale genres into something fresh: the lush romantic period piece and the ""AHA!"" mystery thriller (a genre M. Night Shamalyan has single-handedly run into the ground recently). Helmed by a first time director (Neil Burger), based on a short story, and featuring an eclectic cast, ""The Illusionist"" had the perfect set-up to be a monumental disaster. With a graceful slight-of-hand, it ends up being something very good.<br/><br/>As with any run-of-the-mill period piece, there's a lavish attention to the set designs and costumes, here representing late nineteenth century Vienna. Director Burger puts a nice spin on the same-old, same-old with an acute attention to lighting (especially in the dreamily over-exposed flashbacks) and old fashioned camera techniques (witness the circular camera's eye closing to transition from scenes) to give the film the feel of being a fond memory of a classic movie from a bygone era.<br/><br/>The central romance where Edward Norton's title character and Jessica Biel's Dutchess are star-crossed lovers kept apart because of class and society, had all the makings of a snore-inducing cheese-athon. Executed in an understated manner that services the greater plot, it ends up being anything but. Norton's performance, especially in the second half of the film when he turns into a man of very few words, had the potential to be one-note. As an actor, he speaks volumes with his eyes. Biel, a former teen idol and TV star, seemed a horrific choice for this role. She pulls of the nifty trick of being quite good. Even better are Rufus Sewell as the tyrannical crown-prince and Paul Giamatti as the chief inspector. Using a short story as the source material, characterizations had the potential to be paper-thin, but these seasoned veterans make the most of their lines and scenes adding terror, humor, and gravitas through their vocal and physical deliveries where lesser actors would've been wooden and cold. The entire cast also worked together very well utilizing their odd, vaguely European and aristorcatic accent. Everyone used it so consistently and earnestly, it didn't seem to matter after awhile that the accent was unnecessary.<br/><br/>A more over-eager or pretentious director may have completely sabotaged the fantastic ending to ""The Illusionist"" and cheated the audience. Handled deftly by Burger, the grande finale where ""all is revealed"" is a wholly organic and satisfying conclusion that rewards the patient viewer and fulfills the lofty promises of the themes presented throughout the work.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" boasts an excellent music score from minimalist composer Phillip Glass that easily rivals his great work done in ""Candyman"" and ""The Hours."" Norton and Giamatti treat us to some of the best ""staring"" since the days of silent films. The look on Giamatti's face and the positioning of his raised eyebrows as he watches Norton perform his illusions coupled with Norton's eyes as he pulls off his tricks are priceless."
"maria-309","9","369","451","9 August 2006"," Norton is mesmerizing
","I am a long time fan of the old theatre magicians and have been fascinated by the wave of spiritualism that swept both continents around the turn of the last century. This movie plays off those real life happenings, with the added twist of court and political intrigue. The movie is lush - as a period piece should be - with terrific performances from a true ensemble cast. Edward Norton has the charismatic gaze that makes you believe in every thing he does. Jennifer Biel is tragic and compelling as a woman trapped by society and dubious duty. Paul Giamatti - who seems to be in every other movie these days - is wonderful as a conflicted man unsure of whom he serves. Rufus Sewell, as the Crown Prince Leopold, is that man, and he embodies the boo-hiss villain. Vain and driven, he is larger than life and not one to cross, as the illusionist comes to find out. The music of Philip Glass fits the scenes and add just the right amount of tension. Plus the horses are very old world with large hooves and a heck of a lot of presence. A compelling and beautiful film."
"cshuman-1","10","463","596","26 January 2006"," Brilliant movie, exceptional all around
","This movie was stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story. Ed Norton was mesmerizing, a superb performance that allowed the story to unfold seemingly at his discretion. Jess Biel was very believable and stunningly beautiful. Paul Giamatti (sp) played an admirable role and took the viewer by surprise in many elements of the story. The story was fresh and imaginative, very intriguing. Not as predictable as you would think. We saw this at a Sundance screening and the entire theater of 500+ seats was full and when the movie was over all you could hear was excited and happy chatter, lots of applause as well. Director came out for a Q&A after and was very amiable in answering questions. Highly recommended!!!"
"aaron_poubelle","10","188","239","14 August 2006"," A beautifully crafted and gorgeous film!
","I went to this see this film knowing only the names of the actors, having seen no trailers and having read no reviews. It is one of the best movies I've seen in years! I was completely captivated, as were almost all of the others in the audience, judging by the loud applause. I love magic shows and was delighted by the authentic look of Eisenheim's illusions performed on a stage having at most a chair and a table, lit by limelights. Other reviewers have described better than I the beautiful scenery, music, visuals, and acting and have given the movie high marks..<br/><br/>Then there are the reviewers who post spoilers and others who claim to have ""figured it out"" way before the end and therefore give it low scores. They are kin to those in a magicians audience who cannot appreciate the illusion but spend all their time guessing how the trick is done and must tell everyone they know the secret. Ignore them! Go see the movie and be drawn in to a fascinating story!"
"rublico","10","301","393","30 April 2006"," Must see mystery!
","I just saw this wonderful film at the San Francisco Film Festival as a surprise entry. Beautifully shot and realized, it keeps you guessing until the end as to the true outcome. It was throughly entertaining and innovative. This movie has it all: romance, suspense, star crossed lovers and supernatural illusions. Edward Norton is perfectly cast as Eisenheim The Illusionist. His accent flowed seamlessly and he simply disappeared into the role. The real revelation to me was none other than Paul Giamatti. Paul's richly accented role was not altogether unlike Tommy Lee Jones' role in The Fugitive. I found his scenes with Norton full of respect and begrudging admiration. It was an absolute joy to see these two pros at work. I will definitely be paying to see this one again when it's released theatrically."
"maddie_brooks","8","216","285","3 July 2006"," Worth the price of tickets
","The Illusionist is a very entertaining movie. The beginning of the movie sets an awesome foundation for the rest of the film to work with, without making the rest of the movie predictable and pointless. Although the basic story of boy gets girl, boy loses girl may not be original, the way the plot is presented with the excellent magical imagery keeps one interested in Edward Norton's character. My only complaint would be that the movie needs a little editing towards the end as the creators seem to show basically the same scene over and over in an attempt to drive home Norton's character's emotional distress. Unfortunately, this gets a little monotonous for viewers. Still, Norton, Sewell, Giamatti (and surprisingly Biel) provide excellent performances that, along with the beautiful cinematography, make a great movie."
"MadeOfScars","10","9","9","6 September 2006"," ""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion.""
","And Edward Norton is absolutely right. Nothing in this movie is what it seems. I was floored by the end of this movie. This was a wonderful job by everyone, actors and director. I couldn't believe how it ended, I wanted to stand up and clap at the end because of how beautifully it was done. This movie really grows on you. In the beginning I wasn't really impressed, but by the end I was completely convinced that this was a real work of art. The acting was great. Norton, Biel, and Giamatti all did tremendous jobs in my opinion. This is the best fictional biography I have ever seen. This Eisenheim character seems like a real person and not someone based on a short story. Norton is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors, the guy has more range than I've seen from anyone in a while. He's always playing different characters and he always does a very good job. I think everyone should go and see this movie, it won't let you down."
"coolpop54","10","183","244","16 September 2006"," A Wonderful, suspenseful, sensual escape from reality
","I love movies of all type for different reasons. Action movies to become stimulated physically, comedies to laugh my troubles away, suspense to sit on the edge of my seat. But mostly, I attend movies to escape from a humdrum and dangerous world. ""The Illusionist"" is the ultimate in escape movies. It is gripping from he opening scene and the grip lasts until the final realization. The story is masterfully crafted and the screenplay intriguing. The special effects and illusions are entertainment enough. But all of this surrounded in the backdrop of the story, it's movement from one idea to another is an added treat. First there is the marvelous acting of all the major actors, surrounded by great support. The cinematography and music are awesome. This movie is filled with entertainment, suspense, romance, sensuality tastefully done, treachery and surprises. I have not been so entranced by a movie since the first Banderas Zorro movie. I didn't look at my watch once and the one hour and forty-five minutes flew by in delight. I want to see this movie over and over again. and I will still marvel at its perfection. You all must go and see it."
"wmjaho","9","124","165","24 January 2006"," A Truly Outstanding Movie
","Hats off to director Neil Burger. He bit off a big challenge with The Illusionist, and he pulled it off admirably. This is a very liberal adaptation of a Steven Millhauser story about a magician in Victorian era in Vienna. Shot entirely in the Czech Republic at gorgeously befitting locations, this is a beautifully made period piece, complete with genuine turn-of-the-century illusions, a wonderful soundtrack, lovely cinematography and an intriguing story.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, the magician who lost his first love as a young boy because they were separated by classes, but years later when he is touring Vienna rediscovers her in the form of Princess Sophie (Jessica Beil). Unfortunately, Sophie is engaged to be married to the unseemly Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who immediately takes a dislike to Eisenheim, chiefly because he fails to debunk his illusions. Prince Leopold, not one to do his own dirty work, relies upon Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to handle Eisenheim.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is great as Eisenheim. (That shouldn't be surprising as he's turned in some truly remarkable performances in the pastFight Club, American History XXX, Rounders and The Score.) And of course Paul Giamatti is excellent as well, although his role is something of a departure for him. But perhaps most surprising is Biel, who is not only radiantly beautiful in this movie, but shows surprising talent as well, and holds her screen presence toe to toe with Norton.<br/><br/>Burger has managed to pull off really a remarkable film. The plot moves along steadily. There is also a very consistent tonality--a foreboding dreariness that perfectly matches the subject matter and the period. (In the same way that David Lynch did with The Elephant Man.) The illusions are captivating and almost believable. The love story is touching. And Eisenheim is a compelling and sympathetic hero, blessed with such unconventionally heroic talents that the entire movie feels fresh and alive."
"annaclara-1","10","8","8","13 April 2007"," Made my night
","Tonight was one of those night I had gone to the movies just because I wanted to, no specific title in mind. I get there, and The Illusionist, which I had heard nothing about except that it had been compared to The Prestige, as they were both about magic. I went not knowing what to expect, and for most of the movie, the plot seemed very linear and although it had many good parts, it was nothing amazing. And then (SPOILER ALERT)the ending started. At first I didn't understand what was going on, what the the Orange tree business meant. And then as the images started to flow, I started to understand. I'm majoring in movie directing, and I have an insight in some of the most used tricks in the business, and I usually catch on pretty fast. But here, the director was so good at hot and cold showers, I swallowed everything... line, hook, everything. He tells time and time again in the movie that it's all fake, it's a trick, it's nothing but that. And in the meantime he convinces you that you are witnessing real magic, that he's a sorcerer instead of a magician. But the trick is what the director pulls on the audience. When the titles started rolling nobody got up to leave. And I mean NOBODY. I was happy all the way to the car. Just glad to have been made a fool of, because really isn't that why we all go to the movies? To believe?"
"ccthemovieman-1","10","106","144","15 January 2007"," One Of The Classiest Films You'll See All Year
","First of all, let me say this was a beautifully-filmed movie, just gorgeous from first to last frame. That gets big points with me. Just as impressive was the story, a fantasy-mystery- romance-drama combination set in Vienna, Austria, around the turn of the 20th century.<br/><br/>It is a story that should keep most viewers intrigued all the way and perhaps surprised quite a bit at the end. Edward Norton does his normal job of making you fascinated with whatever character he's playing, this time a magician with almost supernatural powers: ""Herr Eisenheim."" The character he plays, and the tone of the movie in general, is pretty low-key with next to nothing in (on screen) violence or profanity.<br/><br/>It's simply a classy film and a modern-day one that older folks would very much enjoy as well as younger adults. Paul Giamatti also is very interesting as the police inspector, torn between his allegiance to the villain crown prince and to the truth and what is the right thing to do. The movie, however, belongs to Norton.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: good stuff, classy film. I haven't talked to anybody yet who watched this and didn't like it."
"michaelzstuff","10","195","289","16 September 2006"," Simply a wonderful film! Absolutely stunning Cinemaptography!
","I loved this movie. It's just that simple. I've seen it several times and the charm never wears off. Yes, it ultimately is a 'feel good movie', but is that so wrong? It keeps you mesmerized until the very last scene. This film is destined to be a classic.<br/><br/>As I read some of the other comments about this movie on IMDb, I realize that cynicism can easily get in the way of just enjoying a movie for what it is. This is a magnificent film! Edward Norton and Paul Giametti are terrific and so is the rest of the cast. The cinematography was stunning. The script was superb. The direction was outstanding. I really can't say anything bad about this film. I thoroughly recommend this movie! I could give it no less than a 10."
"fred3f","7","71","100","4 September 2006"," Entertaining
","This film may not make cinema history, win an academy award or be lauded by the critics. But compared to the majority of films out there right now it stands out as good solid entertainment. It doesn't try to make a political point or manipulate the audience into being for or against Bush, global warming, animal rights, the plight of the three toed salamander etc. etc. etc. It does what Hollywood movies are best at by taking you away from all the tiresome simplifications of complex worldly issues and letting you enjoy yourself for an hour and fifty minutes. It is a story of lovers and their struggle to be together and to be in love - a story that has been told a million times (at least) and never wears out. The acting is capable, the lovers have good chemistry, the villain is sufficiently believable and evil, the hero is clever and the plot is excellent. This is storytelling at its best. So forget about the war, the economy, or if you are politically correct enough to survive in this crazy world and enjoy yourself. Go to the movies - or at least this movie. Walk out feeling good. It's therapeutic."
"mkane5","9","125","188","9 August 2006"," Like the Moody Blues song asks--""real or just an illusion?""
","Kind of a strange movie but very original and entertaining! It was a Gothic-romance period-piece drama-mystery, and quirky characters and a bizarre--or at least unusual--plot held my interest. <br/><br/>Edward Norton's character plays an inscrutable but romantic master illusionist. But is he just a master illusionist or has he developed powers to effect the creepy conjuring of those who have passed on? (Regardless, the guy is so easy on the eyes.)<br/><br/>Jessica Biel is beautiful and good in her role but I couldn't help thinking, ""Hey, Jessica, Scarlett Johanssen called. She wants her lips back."" <br/><br/>Paul Giamatti bothered me just a tad at first because he spoke in a near-whisper and had a scruffy beard so you couldn't read his lips. He got louder and his character developed pretty darned well, thank goodness. Actually, he was fantastic (so what else is new?). <br/><br/>The makers of this movie did the same thing the makers of Little Miss Sunshine did--made me want to see the film twice, but for different reasons: LMS because the first time I saw it, I laughed so hard I cried, and I really needed a laugh again (and got it); The Illusionist because I was like the audience for the title character's shows the first time I saw it--just kind of naive and awed and staring up at the action with my mouth hanging open. So I'll have to see it again and pay attention. Kind of like when my daughter told me to go see The Sixth Sense again and pay attention to what Bruce Willis's character was wearing. (Plot-wise, this is unrelated, folks--just a movie watcher's analogy.)<br/><br/>At first, the old-fashioned circle wipes seemed a little distracting, but in retrospect, they were part of the excellent movie-making decisions that created the illusion of time and place in this film. A really good story with really good art direction and really good actors, costumes and settings. Definitely worth a go-see--or two!"
"A_Roode","7","52","80","10 August 2006"," A good little mystery with some very nice acting.
","Although I spotted the inevitable conclusion coming about half way through the film (Jessica Biel and Ed Norton are discussing a possible future together; her pragmatic analysis of what would need to take place set off alarm bells for me that ultimately proved my instincts correct), it is a testament to the film that I was still engaged enough to see how all of the pieces in the story would fall into place. 'The Illusionist' is a fairly decent example of a script that sets up a certain number of expectations and then toys with the outcomes before knocking them all down like dominoes.<br/><br/>There are three main reasons to watch 'The Illusionist.' The first reason is that the script isn't too bad. I was with a group of friends. Two of us guessed correctly how the film was going to develop. The other five were quite surprised by the film's ending. None of us were disappointed and the film got an ovation from the audience when it was over. I would describe 'The Illusionist' as a mystery or a puzzle. If you like films that make the grey matter between your ears do a little work, you might just find yourself pleasantly surprised -- that said, there isn't anything so taxing here as to make the film overly complex or convoluted.<br/><br/>The second reason to watch this film is the involvement of Ricky Jay. He's in the credits for consultation and as one of the best magicians working today in Hollywood, it is worth your time to take a look at the film to see some of his influence. I'll be interested when this comes out on DVD to find out the degree of involvement. If the producers were smart, they probably listened a lot to a man who is in the Guiness book of World Records for his use of playing cards as weapons! My third reason to recommend 'The Illusionist' is some excellent work from the three main male leads: Paul Giamatti, Ed Norton and Rufus Sewell. As a qualifier, let me add that Jessica Biel does a pretty good job too -- I just found that the energy and zeal with which her male counterparts performed ate up the screen and left her adrift. There's a little joke in there you might find funny after you've watched the film. Ed Norton is very controlled and restrained here, Rufus Sewell seems to relish every scene he's in with villainous delight and Paul Giamatti shines as the police inspector with a taste for amateur magic. Giamatti has a gift for facial expressions and, as a friend of mine hilariously put it, in his final scene his facial expression is 'six degrees of crazy.' I love that! These are three compelling performances and although you might see your way through the contrivances of the script, the good performances should be more than enough to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>'The Illusionist' isn't bad. A good little mystery with some nice acting all around."
"ma-cortes","8","9","11","12 January 2013"," Awesome and handsome film set in early 1900's Vienna about a magician , his lover and a nasty prince
","Imaginative and intriguing flick set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, where takes place a crash of wits between a famous magician , a price and and a Police Inspector . This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among an ambitious , easy-going magician named Eisenheim (Edward Norton who did many of his own magic tricks, with the coaching of James Freedman) who becomes a prestigious illusionist and get mutual envy , a Police chief (Paul Giamatti) and the heir prince (Rufus Sewel) ; being set in turn-of-the last century , Vienna (although the film is set in Austria, it was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic) . Their escalating cat and mouse feud is played out in palaces , theaters and Vienna streets . Eisenheim (his character is closely based on the magician and supposed clairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussen, who was famous in Vienna in the early part of the 20th century and was murdered by Nazi soldiers in 1933) delivers the most spectacular version of a teleportation trick that calls for something like real magic . The stage illusionist falls in love with a woman well above his social standing . He will use his abilities to secure the love of a gorgeous girl (Jessica Biel replaced Liv Tyler, who dropped out of the film just as filming was about to begin) far above his social standing as the magician use his powers to combat his enemies . The Duchess Von Teschen is soon to be wed to the Crown Prince Leopold in what would be for him a marriage solely in pursuit of power : overthrowing his father, the Emperor Leopold , as well as overtaking the Hungarian side of the empire .<br/><br/>This splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres : the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era , mystery thriller and fantasy . The picture gets it all : suspense , mystery drama , star crossed lovers , plot twists , murders ,tragedy , exquisite costumes and supernatural illusions . It inhabits a world between reality and illusion as when Inspector's investigation develops , it's amazingly unclear whether the illusionist is the performer of unbelievably excellent tricks or genuine supernatural acts . Explicitly modelled on the pattern of a magic trick , it's also bound by the rules of the mystery thriller genre . And in devoting so much room to romantic subplot , the picture ends up breaking the magician's cardinal rules . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Edward Norton , Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti as well as eclectic secondaries , Rufus Sewel , Jake Wood and Eddie Marsan .Although the story is fictional, some of the details are based on the life of Austrian Crown Prince Rudolf, only son of Emperor Franz Josef. The painting of the emperor which Eisenheim creates is an actual portrait of Franz Josef ; the bodies of Rudolf and his mistress, the Baroness Mary Vetsera, were found at his hunting lodge Mayerling on January 30, 1889 in what is now known as the ""Mayerling Incident"". This was initially covered up by the Imperial Family, creating controversy and mystery. Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Dick Pope ; too marvelously photographed in a red sepia palette flashed with colorful images . Intriguing as well as evocative musical score by Philip Glass . The motion picture was perfectly directed by innovator director Neal Burger , a filmmaker who has filmed notorious movies such as ¨The lucky ones¨ , ¨Interview with the assassin¨ and his most successful , ¨Limitless¨ . At the same time was made another film (2006) with similar theme about magicians titled ¨The prestige¨ (2006) by Christopher Nolan with Hugh Jackman , Christian Bale and Michael Caine . 'The illusionist' results to be a magnificent picture which achieved much success . Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting , and no as predictable as you would think . The film turns out to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final<br/><br/>."
"sarastro7","6","35","54","3 January 2007"," Not much more than mediocre
","I have to say I was a little bit disappointed with The Illusionist. It had top-notch production values and a classy cast, but it was not quite enough. It was more of a crime/love drama than a magician story. I'm sitting there waiting for more magic tricks, and explanations for the ridiculously great acts he performs, but the story won't go there. It just focuses on the love story, like a hundred thousand other movies. To me, it was boring. It didn't deliver. Sure, I didn't see the end coming, and it was logical enough, but not that impressive. How did he create those intangible holograms? No explanation. That's just silly.<br/><br/>I went to see ""Perfume - The Story of a Murderer"" on the same day as I saw The Illusionist, and the former movie was much superior. An art movie. Whereas The Illusionist is just well-produced fluff.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."
"randomStuff101","4","14","19","24 February 2007"," Quite dull, don't bother.
","If you saw The Prestige, prepare yourself for an inferior movie. Sure, The Illusionist sounds promising... the magician, the magic tricks, Edward Norton, the love story... you'd be forgiven for expecting a good night at the movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it ends up a dull night at the movies if your movie tastes are at least average. For one thing, we're asked to suspend too much belief - with unremarkable film effects standing in for any realistic conveying of ""genuine"" magic. You'll find yourself thinking, ""oh, it's *that* sort of movie""...meaning cheesy impossible supernatural stuff -- things floating in mid air etc.. which is not clever or interesting.<br/><br/>The Prestige is so much darker and complex. The characters have grit, passion, realism; the story and script more exciting, surprising and refined. Even though we're asked to believe in something quite impossible in The Prestige, it pulls it off somehow. The Illusionist doesn't pull anything off, and lacks most qualities your keen movie appreciation is tuned for.<br/><br/>Cinematography was fine. The acting was mostly OK if a little dry... it was the story and screenplay / dialog that was shackled - never shifting into second gear. There are no satisfying narrative developments... you won't care for these characters much at all, and any plot twists that may happen, arrive with a clumsy thud and don't do anything to lift the film's spirits (pardon the pun). <br/><br/>4 / 10"
"Critical Eye UK","9","4","4","6 December 2007"," Quality is not an illusion. . .
","As joyful a movie as any that have been released in recent years, ""The Illusionist"" -- in my case, at least -- has come hard on the heels of the vacuous ""The Lake House"" and the execrable ""Poseidon"".<br/><br/>Both are relevant here: star-crossed lovers in the former, reality-defeating special effects (or not so special, after all) victims in the latter.<br/><br/>And then comes ""The Illusionist"".<br/><br/>A movie consistent with writer /director Neil Burger's previous exploration of illusion versus reality, it avoids the monumental daftness of ""Lake House"" and the moronic CGI of ""Poseidon"" to instead deliver something of charm and sheer, unadulterated entertainment value.<br/><br/>Yes, it could've been as clunky an exploration of what's real and what's not as ""Lake House"". That it isn't says much for the original short story (penned by Pulitzer prize winner Millhauser)and even more for Burger: the movie is a parlour trick, no more, no less; it engages because its ambitiousness is concealed beneath its simplicities.<br/><br/>And it works -- superbly -- thanks to some stand-out performances (Paul Giametti and Rufus Sewell especially, though then again, they're certainly given much more to do than Edward Norton or Jessica Biel), Dick Pope's almost impossibly lush cinematography. . . and a film score by Philip Glass not only as original as the screenplay itself, but as romantic, and powerful, as anything penned by Rota and Rozsa.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" isn't the Greatest Movie Ever Made because it never set out to be. What it is, instead, is gentle. Joyful. Entertaining. And hugely accomplished. A few more parlour tricks like this one, and the magic truly will be back in movie-making."
"samkan","5","4","4","22 January 2007"," Not So magical
","I have read dozens of the comments herein and must agree most with those who felt disappointed. THE ILLUSIONIST is a beautiful period piece, well casted and acted, etc. But the film paints itself into a dramatic corner and then makes a mess of escaping itself.<br/><br/>The plot holds no surprises. It is clear that the storyline is about the magician winning back, rescuing, etc., his true love from an unhappy life and evil prince. Nothing new there. Certainly the film could have helped itself if the leading lovers had not consummated their passion so early in the film. There is also a very nice subplot regarding the internal conflict of Giamatti's inspector, who is intrinsically good but who has been corrupted. I call this a ""subplot"" because I was interested in seeing on which side of good and evil this character ultimately stood. Well scripted and acted in that regard. It seemed clear to me that the suspense; i.e., the question for which we were being teased, was the great Eisenheim's nature. Had his travels, experiences, etc., effected a transformation? What and where did he learn what he did? Had he sold his soul to the devil? <br/><br/>Apparently I am way off base as far as the movie's motives, its main conflict, its intent, etc.. I'm still unsure what the film is trying to suggest. In light of the explanation packaged together in the last few minutes of the film, I think we are being asked to believe that Norton's character was a great magician with deep insight into human nature. If such is the case, no explanation whatsoever is provided for how Eisenheim's tricks are performed. So if we must swallow that Eisenheim can do ANYTHING, create ANY illusion, etc., where is the suspense? Its like the Superman adventure where Superman reverses the spin of the world to turn back time. If a hero is so God-like that he can do ANYTHING why should we be anxious, fearful, curious, etc., about conflict, predicament or dramatic tension? If Eisenheim can perform ANY feat why should we worry about the ending?<br/><br/>In light of the awkward explanation at the end, it seems clear that the creators of this movie do not suggest that Eisenheim had supernatural abilities. In retrospect, it might have been a more satisfying resolution if we learned that the magician, indeed, was a member of the dark side; e.g., this may have lent some substance to the Inspector's anxiety about whose side he should have been on. In sum, taking away the mystery about Eisenheim the man and asking viewers to simply take for granted that the magician can do anything imaginable, we are left with a boring story with a predictable ending. That is not magic at all."
"nobarnes","8","27","41","25 May 2006"," Beautiful to watch, engaging and unique, well-acted
","Having just seen this at the Seattle International Film Festival, I can say I went in with very few preconceived notions (not having read the reviews from Sundance), and left feeling like I'd just watched something particularly beautiful and unique, with an ending that made me ask questions about what I'd been seeing all along. Some will say it's predictable; perhaps it's just me, but I bought in to it for the ride and felt the payoff at the end was compelling and justified.<br/><br/>Neil Burger recreates the wonder that we all feel at watching a great magician - is it really an illusion, or is there something else going on? That drives much of the movie, pushing through several subtexts of romance, monarchical intrigue, and societal class system flaws. Beautifully shot, and well acted. Paul Giamatti, as always, is wonderful, and surprisingly good was Jessica Biel, whose Sophie is truly mesmerizing in her devotion to her childhood friend and need to break out of the societal role in which she feels trapped. That friend, Eisenheim, played excellently by Edward Norton, is equally devoted to her and will stop at nothing to see her find what she's looking for. And by the way, it's so good to see Rufus Sewell in period costume again as the questionably ethical Crown Prince Leopold.<br/><br/>All that being said, it's not perfect. The varying accents and occasionally stilted dialogue make it hard to understand what's being said. But all in all, a real delight."

","THE ILLUSIONIST 2006 (EDWARD NORTON, JESSICA BIEL, PAUL GIAMIATTI) DIRECTED BY: NEIL BURGER ~ THE RUNDOWN: A well acted, nicely polished piece of entertainment, but made with little passion and little drama. ~ It's hard to say exactly what this movie's missing; the performances are fun to watch, especially that freaky Rufus Sewell guy, and, as always, Edward Norton is amazing as well as Giamatti; it is entertaining in an old-fashioned, mystery type of way; and it's beautifully shot, but I think that's part of the problem - it's too beautiful...too old-fashioned...too much like a movie that tries too hard to impress us with its image and not engage us enough with its story. To compare it with 2006's The Prestige, a film about the same subject, the Prestige simply crushes the Illusionist when it comes to ""movie magic"", relying very little on CGI and reaching our hearts through an amazing script about humanity...the strive for success, the need to be loved and at the same time showing us how magic really exists in our modern world. The Illusionist, on the other hand, is simply more superficial in nature and would work better as like a thirty-minute TV show. The big twist at the end would be very satisfying for avid TV watchers just after a commercial break, but, seriously, when your making a movie around it you shouldn't just have the viewer sit and wait with little to no hints just to fill up time and then hit them with it and expect a big hooray. ~ Overall, this actually is worth watching because it is indeed entertaining, well acted and interesting, but don't feel bad either if you decide to skip it."
"jotix100","8","9","12","28 October 2006"," The conjurer
","Early in life, Eisenheim understands how his destiny is going to be tied to magic. Unfortunately for the young man, after falling in love for a rich young girl, Sophie, his powers prove to be a failure when he can't prevent the young woman from being taken away from him. Sophie will always keep the locket with a secret mechanism Eisenheim made for her as a reminder of his love.<br/><br/>For fifteen long years Eisenheim roams the world trying to perfect his craft as a magician. When the time is ripe, he returns to Vienna to look for his long lost love and to dazzle audiences with his amazing tricks. It is at his Vienna appearances that his fame reaches the crown prince Leopold, who wants to see this illusionist. He is accompanied to the performance by Sophie, who is now Leopold's love interest. When Eisenheim asks for a volunteer for one of his magic tricks, it's Sophie who goes to the stage. Eisenheim recognizes his beloved Sophie who still wears the locket around her neck.<br/><br/>Things get complicated when Eisenheim is asked to do a performance for the prince at the palace. The one trick that stuns everyone is when the conjurer asks the prince for his sword, which he makes stand on the stage. He then asks members of the audience to try to lift the sword, which magically remains glued to the ground. Only when he tells Leopold to take the sword back, the sword is released to its rightful owner. That sword will yield a valuable clue to the mystery we are witnessing later on.<br/><br/>Eisenheim made an admirer in Uhl, the chief of police who is impressed by what he sees Eisenheim do on stage. Uhl will be the only man who will understand the secret that Eisenheim keeps in his heart.<br/><br/>This highly enjoyable movie directed by Neil Burger, is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser. The adaptation by Mr. Burger gets a great treatment for the screen. The film is helped by the interesting score of Philip Glass. Mr. Burger has done wonders with the way he envelops the audience with magic as one watches in amazement how Eisenheim performs his thrilling act. Dick Pope photographed the movie in dark tones that reflect the mood of most of the action on the screen. His take on the Czech exteriors strike the right note. Naomi Geraghty must be congratulated for the editing, since it involves the way the viewer perceives the tricks being done by Eisenheim.<br/><br/>Edward Norton gives a wonderful performance as Eisenheim. He is clearly a man with a mission in life and he has returned to his native land to take what he believes is rightfully his. Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl has some good moments too. Lovely Jessica Biel is seen as Sophie and Rufus Sewell plays the crown prince Leopold.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" will not disappoint fans of Edward Norton because the good work of the director, Neil Burger, did in adapting the original material for this highly engrossing picture."
"MGLevandoski","5","25","41","10 January 2007"," A blaring disappointment.
","I was very much looking forward to seeing The Illusionist when it came out on DVD, as I missed its run in theatres, and with grave regret I have to say that I did not like this movie. I wanted so badly to love it, but as it turns out the ending made it impossible for me to do so.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, in typically great form, plays Eisenheim the Illusionist, Jessica Biel plays The Duchess, Eisenhiem's love interest and fiancé to the power hungry Crown Prince(Rufus Sewell), and Paul Giamatti plays the Chief Inspector of Vienna who is in charge of trying to solve the mysteries behind the eye popping feats of Eisenheim. Every actor involved does a splendid job. The story is a love story, with betrayal and mystery, with all sorts of magical sights and sounds. It touches on the mystical/spiritual side of Eisenheim, but fails miserably at following it up with any sort of substance.<br/><br/>The most interesting part of the film, which I bought into, hook, line and sinker right from the get go, was the fact that magic seemed possible. It seemed real. It rooted itself in the supernatural, and then failed to grow. It planted the seed of the magical orange tree in your mind and then forgot to water it.<br/><br/>The movie forgot that it was a work of fiction, and would not allow itself to be anything but reality. It took no risks, it took no chances, it did nothing fantastical and amazing other than showing how fantastic of a let down an incredibly masterful and atmospheric movie can be when the director wimps out and decides he has to make everything explainable and real in the end. All of the hard work and obvious skill that went into making this film into a mysterious and wondrous love story was wasted by the most incredibly copped out ending I have seen in years."
"Quinoa1984","6","67","124","14 October 2006"," there's more potential than is really tapped into in the Illusionist
","The Illusionist is actually more than anything an actor's movie, which is a little ironic considering how much romantic sweep and movement there should be in the writing and directing. In terms of Neil Burger's direction, it's never really bad at all, and is very competent most of the time (aside from a couple of notable instances involving the 'soft focus' around the edges of the frame in flashbacks and one sex scene). The writing, however, is a little more lacking even if it's also never annoying or deterring from what's watchable in the film. But there's contrivances as well, through all that is supposed to be seen as complex and very intricate and exquisite. The latter of those can be tapped into in the period setting of early 20th century Vienna, and it's always professionally done. But there's something lacking to it as well- a real driving force through the romantic core of the story, and that supporting characters are more interesting than the main characters, almost in spite of the performances.<br/><br/>And as mentioned, if there's any reason more than anything to see it it's for the acting, where Edward Norton makes a character who's own purpose and need in the film is very narrow (to make his illusions, but more than anything all for the possession and togetherness of another woman, played by Jessica Biel). As a child he, Eisenheim, and Sophie meet and fall in love, but are separated by the boundaries of class. Years pass, and she comes back into his life by chance, but now she has a suitor, a Prince played by the icy Rufus Sewell. When a certain tragedy befalls the situation of the Prince and his bride-to-be, this sets Eisenheim off into a whole new direction with his illusions (Norton often in a trembling, shocked trance look that is always convincing) by conjuring up lost souls. This the sets off Paul Giamatti's inspector character, and the ties become all the greater to what may become of the central question, however elusive it might seem.<br/><br/>All of this might be even more compelling if the actual romantic plot felt stronger. But despite the impeccable skills of Norton, who makes this bland character driven and intuitive (his choices as an actor are very good here if not great), and the OK presence of Biel, their characters aren't as interesting as the tricks and leap-of-faith sized wonders that Eisenheim creates on the stage. If anything at times the film felt stronger and with a better purpose and strength with Giamatti on screen, as he is more than anything the part of the audience, trying to figure things out. By the end his own revelation is probably the biggest leap of all, almost Shyamalan-sized, yet I find his performance is what sticks with me as opposed to the twists and surprises thrown to the audience. It's almost as if the iron-clad conventions of the plot and the intensity, passion and creativity of what goes on in Eisenheim's total control battle it out for dominance. I'd recommend the Illusionist, but with some reservations that not the spectacular event that it might seem to be. Its got skill and tact and a very fine sensibility with Norton and Giamatti and even the dastardly done Prince by Sewell. Though at the same time it's really got nothing up its sleeve. Grade: B"

"Superunknovvn","5","15","23","13 February 2007"," A huge disappointment
","This is the movie that is supposed to be the huge competitor of Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige""? This is the movie that received a rating of 7.7 here on IMDb? God, this movie is a joke! I can't believe how many things are wrong with it. This movie about a magician has fallen into every trap ""The Prestige"" avoided. Whereas in Nolan's film all magic tricks are possible at least according to the movie's logic, ""The Illusionist"" makes the magician look like a real wizard. Apparently director Neil Burger wanted to leave it to the viewer to decide whether Norton's character Eisenheim relies on tricks or really has magical powers. That is the first thing that is very lame about ""The Illusionist"".<br/><br/>What's worse is the story. Slow, uninteresting, not believable and ultimately completely unsatisfying. In other words, the script is a complete failure.<br/><br/>The most shocking thing, however, is the acting. I would never have thought that Edward Norton could be so bad. He stumbles through this movie like an amateur playing his first main role in a high school stage play. Nothing much could be expected from Jessica Biel and she's just about not horrible. Paul Giamatti tried his best to act convincingly but overacted in the end. His constant rolling eyes and his weird ""doubtful, yet intrigued, but always critical"" looks come very close to unintentional comedy. The best performance in this movie was given by Rufus Sewell, but even he couldn't save a character as one dimensional and shallow as Crown Prince Leopold.<br/><br/>One positive thing about the movie is the set design. As a person who is living in Vienna I would have loved if they had shot this right here in my hometown, but hey, what the hell. A movie as promising as this one with a cast like this is exciting enough, even if it just pretends to be set in Vienna or so I thought. Well, after having seen ""The Illusionst"" I'm not very excited anymore. This was just a great opportunity wasted. I wouldn't watch it a second time."

","THE ILLUSIONIST is a satisfying magic show, but not quite up to the standards I expected. One factor that was especially disappointing: any discerning viewer could easily see what the final plot twist would be long before the secret is revealed. Still, it has a certain fascination for any fan of mystery, suspense, Gothic detective stories or any sort of story involving these ingredients.<br/><br/>EDWARD NORTON is Eisenheim, the magician who fascinates audiences with his clever sleight of hand and amazing tricks that seem to indicate he can bring to life dead spirits.<br/><br/>PAUL GIAMATTI is effective as Inspector Uhl who doggedly determines to find out just what's going on behind the illusions, as much to placate his own need to know as it is to satisfy Crown Prince Leopold (RUFUS SEWELL) who has an agenda of his own for wanting the illusionist thrown into prison. It seems that his fiancé (JESSICA BIEL) has been a childhood sweetheart of the magician.<br/><br/>Rufus Sewell gives the film's strongest performance as Crown Prince Leopold, with Norton appearing a bit uneasy in the pivotal role of the man behind the illusions.<br/><br/>The film's biggest flaw is the last portion of the story, which has the detective putting the pieces of the puzzle together as a last minute fix for the story's conclusion. It doesn't strike a truthful chord since the plot was much too complicated to be solved by a few bits and pieces of the inspector's memory.<br/><br/>Summing up: Interesting, lots of atmosphere, beautifully photographed with an appropriate score by Paul Glass that captures the mood perfectly."

","But clearly one of the most disappointing and overrated. 7.7 at IMDb? Wow, I had a very much different experience from the majority of folks here. I concede that the scenery was great, but there were a number of factors that completely ruined the film for me. Here a just a few:<br/><br/>First, was the end supposed to be a surprise? My gosh, it was telegraphed before the ""murder"" ever happened. At the Big Reveal, it played like an M. Night Shyamalan wannabe flick, except way more obvious. I can't believe that many people ""fell for it."" I genuinely thought (or hoped) that the climax was going to *not* be that.<br/><br/>Second, the illusions performed by Eisenheim were simply unbelievable. The fact that it was clearly CGI and not even remotely genuine illusion distracted from the authenticity of the story. If we could expect him to really do these things through trickery or actual supernatural power, then he is capable of way more than the movie delivered. He could have spirited away with Sophie in a much less contrived fashion.<br/><br/>Third, Giamatti as the Inspector seems absolutely amused to realize that he's been a pawn manipulated to investigate a murder that never even happened, a scheme that nearly resulted in his own demise. Oh, those crazy lovers!"
"RanchoTuVu","6","19","31","10 October 2006"," nice looking but hollow
","The Illusionist is a good looking film set in Vienna in the nineteenth century. There's plenty of romanticism, empiricism, and mysticism to ponder over as you try to keep awake with the plot about a magician, no an illusionist, who's trapped by his class, born the son of a carpenter, and can't have the woman he really loves, a duchess, who's equally trapped in her royal status. Not to sell the film short, the story includes a career police officer who's pushed and pulled by a cruel crown prince who promises to make him mayor of Vienna in exchange for his complicity. Their relationship is the film's most interestingly done facet, especially as the police officer noses around into a murder that brings him closer to Mr. Crown Prince. The film's best scene is when the Crown Prince is hunting on his estate and fires off his shotgun, bringing to an abrupt end the talk he was having with the police officer. In the end, it's a meticulous recreation of a time, which isn't nearly matched by a meticulous presentation of a story."

","Ouch! For all that this film promises, I got way more of a surprise seeing the rating it has on this site than anything I saw in the film itself.<br/><br/>The respectable cast do what they can with their bland, boring characters, and the setting is beautiful, but that wasn't nearly enough to keep me interested. An hour or so into the film, I knew how it was going to turn out, and I didn't really care. By the end, I was downright annoyed. I didn't build up enough compassion for the 'hero' and 'heroine' and I didn't dislike the villain enough to justify where the film sees them end up. Don't get me wrong, the villain was evil enough, but the reasons we're given to hate him seemed to be thought up and thrown in with clichéd subtext and a few clichéd scenes at the last minute and some of the decisions he makes later in the film are inconsistent with earlier parts. Maybe I'm a sucker for the bad guy, but I just ended up feeling sorry for him and I guess it's because of that I didn't end up liking the good guys. There's no character development here. Biel's character is insipid, shallow and annoying and Norton does his job well but seems bored most of the way through. Giamatti is as good as ever but his character is at times annoyingly inconsistent too. Sewell didn't have much to work with. If you want to see him as a much better villain in a much better film, see A Knight's Tale.<br/><br/>I was expecting this film to grab me a lot more than it did, but it turned out to be more of a disappointment than anything else."

","This is a very pretty movie and indeed for all intents and purposes it appears to be filmed in a different period. The colours are soft and faded much like going through a very old photo album ( the album of The Empress Elisabeth of Austria comes to mind). And indeed the story is reminiscent of 'Mayerling' and many others of that ilk.<br/><br/>Authentic to a Vienna at the turn of the century with the Czech Republic standing in, the camera makes the most of some interesting angles and wondrous art direction. However both the plot and the dialogue fall far, far short of being satisfying.<br/><br/>For one the actual dialogue is minimalist and for another highly anachronistic ('OK' used). Accents slip and fall and get up again to morph sideways into an unintentional Colonel Klinkishness that grates. Jessica Biel looks far too modern with botoxed trout-lips. Edward Norton does his best, this kind of role is made for him, but he is inadequately served with the anorexic script.<br/><br/>The middle bogs down into tedium, there is no story arc to push it forward ***minor spoiler alert***the heroine has died*** and the illusions enter the realm of spirituality.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti works very hard in his role as the police inspector, tip of the hat to him and to Edward but Rufus Sewell just about chews the scenery out from under anyone who shares a scene with him.<br/><br/>Very disappointing and I am completely shocked at the overall rating at IMDb.

","I have never in my life seen such a poor film as this. It's totally clear that the material from this film came from a short story, as there is so little to this movie. The ""twist"" of the film was something I had taken for granted throughout, as it was so clearly flagged up repeatedly. Anyone with a basic grasp of film vocabulary would never have imagined that an audience could be surprised by the ending. 1) ""Will you make me disappear?"" at the start of the film, asked so dramatically by Sophie would give the impression that Eisenheim might, when older, be able to make her disappear. 2) The last conversation we see between them is him asking her, very seriously, ""Are you SURE you want to disappear?"" which again, would suggest he is going to do something dramatic to ""disappear"" her. 3) We see her ""murder"" from the servant's point of view, suggesting that we are supposed to consider this purposefully merely from his point of view, for future witnessing purposes. 4) We see Eisenheim discussing A Plan with the same old man who then turns up as the ""undertaker"", and takes her body away after her ""death"". 5) The Emperor tells the policeman that he was framed by Eisenheim. Having written all these points down, I'm actually wondering if this film isn't an elaborate joke. A poor, poor show, that everyone involved should be embarrassed about."

My instinct had been to avoid this film, as the trailer made it seem like yet another hammy, creaky, low-budget costume drama with philosophic pretensions. After the film's opening credits began to roll, and the theater filled with a Philip Glass score so terrible I thought the fool from ""Finding Neverland"" must have written it, I realized that the film recommendations of friends and colleagues are generally as unreliable as, say, their recommendations for who should become your life partner.<br/><br/>In any case, I won't add to the general dissatisfactions already expressed about this film in other user comments except to say that rarely have I seen such monotonous acting in service of so terrible a script, apart from B-horror flicks- and then those elements are 90% of the fun of watching. Norton, Giamatti, Sewell and especially Biel wander around the screen in a zombie-like haze, perhaps seduced and bewildered by the faux European accents they're required to sport. I suppose the director intended there to be an air of gravitas to all the sombre pacing and actorly frowns, but as my guest at the cinema put it after watching Norton and Biel's ""tender"" love scene: ""this is like a high-school play."" Indeed.<br/><br/>That so many viewers were surprised by the ending doesn't, sadly, surprise me. It just proves that the majority of people do not watch films all that carefully. The actor playing Norton's mentor pops up twice in the space of 10 minutes- the second time in a pivotal role designed as a big clue, presumably, to the fact that something is rotten in the state of Vienna. As if we didn't already know.<br/><br/>What a stinker."

It's plot is dumb as a snake and its characters are as flat as paper dolls.<br/><br/>Whenever you see a period piece in which the protagonists act as though they've traveled to the age in question from our own to do battle with persons more defined by their times, it's hardly ever that hard to figure out who'll come out on top. See 'Titanic' for a textbook example (A notable exception is 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'). Hmm? Who'll win out? The young hipster who looks like he just stepped out of a Starbucks on his way to wardrobe? Or will it be the rich bastard with the slicked-back hair and the less progressive view of women?<br/><br/>In the present film we meet Eisenheim the illusionist, played flatly by Edward Norton, who is haunted by a childhood romance forbidden by class. He's a poor lout with a passion for card tricks. She's a duchess or something.<br/><br/>He runs off and becomes a guy who entertains people with feats of illusion so eye-popping, he'd have to be more than mere mortal to perform them.<br/><br/>His popularity grows and the emperor's son, Prince Leopold, comes to see the show and brings his girlfriend who turns out to be, you guessed it, Eisenheim's long-lost childhood sweety-pie, Sophie. Sophie, played forgettably by Jessica Biel, is pretty, earnest, and has a set of really nice lips. You know, the kind of chick dudes in the movies line up to risk their whole lives for.<br/><br/>Apparently having aged at two thirds the rate of Eisenheim, Sophie comes up on stage to help out in a trick only Jesus Christ himself could have pulled off. They recognize each other and later decide to try and be together.<br/><br/>But the prince, played handily by Rufus Sewell, is none too pleased. Not only has he got his heart set on keeping Sophie around, but she plays an integral role in his plot to overthrow his dad and assume the throne. What's more, the prince is threatened by Eisenheim's amazing tricks and wants to upstage him.<br/><br/>Nice set-up. Too bad the rest of the story relies on fairy-tale logic to proceed, but real-world logic to endear itself. I don't know much about magic, granted. But I do know that at the dawn of the 20th century, just as today, there is no way to conjure the ghostly form of a chubby little boy out of nowhere, have it toddle up to a stage in various levels of opacity, PASSING THROUGH someone's outreached hand in the process -- revealing it to have the consistency of a slightly gelatinous cloud (like all ghosts in the movies these days) -- and then have it stand triumphant on the stage.<br/><br/>David Copperfield eat your heart out.<br/><br/>And hey, whatever. Fairy-tales are often far more compellingly real than those that abide the laws of physics. Just make up your mind for cripes sake! If the ending relies on good old-fashioned science and cleverness PUT us in a universe in which these things hold sway.<br/><br/>Don't try and have it both ways.<br/><br/>But this sloppy universe isn't what dooms the film.<br/><br/>Like its effects, its plot is laughably implausible when it's not mind-numbingly predictable.<br/><br/>And its characters evince the emotional range of perhaps Punch and/or Judy. Eisenheim is morally perfect and professionally super-human. Sophie is the standard damsel-in-distress. And the prince is a mustache-twirling caricature of a bad-guy. All he doesn't do is tie Sophie to the train-tracks.<br/><br/>*** MAJOR SPOILER, next paragraph only ***<br/><br/>And sure, young lovers should be together but a real careful look at the plot-points reveals two people who fool some cat into thinking he's murdered his girlfriend, get the cops to believe it, and then stand silently by when said cat decides to blow his brains out over it. And sure, the cat is a power-drunk miscreant who MIGHT have killed his girlfriend if she hadn't micked him first and would PROBABLY have overthrown the emperor. But he's a square-jawed, alpha-male bossy dude and is presumed guilty by virtue of his appearance in a modern American film. The ending was twisty, but a real twist would have been for the prince to reveal himself as something deeper than the tin-horn dictator he is portrayed as throughout. Maybe he woos her back from the itinerant entertainer. Now THAT would have been original.<br/><br/>In the end, you've got a pretty standard love triangle/David vs. Goliath story wrapped in a slightly new brand of snazzy effects and really thick atmosphere.<br/><br/>Take your 13-year-old daughter to see this one, but man, bring your i-Pod.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"

","I enjoyed the Prestige, much to my surprise. So when nearly everyone I spoke to told me that The Illusionist was much better, I was eager to see it. What an amazing waste of time.<br/><br/>The first and most notable problem was the directing. There was nothing appealing about any of the shots, rather they seemed very green like a director on his first major film run. It ranked down there with your standard slasher movie in terms of care taken to ensure engaging, unique perspectives. I also found the ""flashback"" techniques (ooh, Grain effect!) to be extremely primitive, again, like a student film that is trying to be so much more than it is.<br/><br/>The story also greatly lacked substance. To me, a good film is something you get something out of--be it a message, a new perspective, or even if you just have a great time watching. This film could have been so much more. While I anticipated something of depth, of unique quality, I received the standard-issued ""poor boy loves high society girl who's engaged to an evil yet powerful boor"". There was nothing special about it. In addition, the movie wasn't clear on what it wanted its audience to believe. Were we supposed to know that Sophie faked her death, or was it supposed to be a giant surprise? Both of those scenarios were not played out well enough.<br/><br/>And then, yes, and then, of course, there is the tremendous lack of explanation of the illusions. To me, that was the entire allure of the movie: ""How IS he doing it?"". We don't get any explanation. How on earth in the late 19th century did this ordinary Illusionist manage to create such vivid imagery? To hold a sword in place by its tip? It's completely implausible, and trying to make up excuses for something that should have been explained quite clearly only returns us to the fact that this was not a good movie.<br/><br/>One other irritating thing about the film was the muddled accents. British? Italian? German? Hungarian? I could never tell. Edward Norton was particularly bad at whatever accent he was trying to pull off, it seemed like a wretched combination of the above four. Even Rufus had tremendous difficulty slipping between accents. It was very uncomfortable and distracting.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about every aspect that irked me about this film, but I'll keep it brief: If you want to see a magician movie this year, skip over the Illusionist and pick up a copy of the Prestige instead. It's by no means a perfect movie, but it is far more enjoyable and offers explanation while leaving just the right amount of mystery."

As a young kid he was friends with Sophie, a duchess but they were taken apart and never saw each other again.Eisenhein then traveled the world learning the art of magic. One day he sees Sophie, now engaged to a crown prince, in one of his shows.From that point on the film focus on Eisenhein attempt to free Sophie from the royal house of Vienna so that they can finally be together.The movie is OK, to be honest, it didn't blew me away and I found the story quite predictable, half way trough the movie I had already figured out what was going to happen,obviously I didn't know all the details but I figured out the big twist almost right away. Plus I don't think this was the best showcase of Norton's abilities. However if you're into period pieces and original(although predictable) plots then give it a try.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"JOHNAMI","7","6","8","22 January 2008"," A compelling mix of magic and mystery.
","Edward Norton's characterization of the title character provides a great deal of the credibility for this highly romantic mystery film. The illusionist, Eisenheim, is a confident, arrogant man who reserves and guards his emotions for the things he really loves. His self-assuredness does not derive from insecurity or some other psychological weakness, but from his achievement of perfecting his skills to an extremely high level of mastery. He creates magic that baffles the mind and only he fully understands the science behind his illusions.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Illusionist"" is very enjoyable. It is also unsatisfying. That is caused by cliques in the plot and in the behavior of the characters. It is sometimes all too clear what will happen, and the characters sometimes do things that contradict their otherwise insightful personalities.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" is a good looking film, with good performances and smooth direction. The magic is especially enjoyable, and the mystery, though not imponderable, is enticing."

","Even if a movie is beautifully shot, which this was, and well-cast, which arguably this was, I canNOT get past a bad script. Every line was predictable, cliché, and completely lacking subtlety. It's as if the movie was written for morons. There was no plot turn that you didn't see coming a mile away, yet there were huge jumps in character development that felt as if huge chunks of the movie were missing (though I didn't need it to be any longer than it was). I felt it beneath the likes of Giamatti and Norton, both very talented. If you are bound and determined to see this movie, I would recommend that you wait to rent this one."
"bob the moo","Null","13","21","18 July 2007"," Surprising dull affair as it misfires on various levels
","As a child, Edward fell in love with a girl who was outside his social class. The girl is taken from him and he is warned of arrest for himself and his wider family. Years pass with Edward travelling the world  the details of this varying depending on which story you listen to. Either way, he eventually remerges under the moniker Eisenheim the Illusionist and is a big draw as his blend of magic and the supernatural leaves audiences gasping. When he comes to Vienna, he finds the girl he loved has become a woman and is now engaged to Crown Prince Leopold.<br/><br/>I was curious to see this having seen The Prestige simply because thematically they seemed similar. However, beyond the idea of using the magic, the period and the uncertainity between real and illusion, the story is quite different as it is much more of a romance-driven tale. Someone on the message board for this film joked that you can tell which of the two films you will prefer if you simply refer to your genitalia and in a way they are quite correct because I do see The Illusionist being of more appeal to women. Maybe I should pull that comment back a bit though, because, regardless of what sex you are, I suspect that you might find this to be as dull as I did.<br/><br/>In theory what we should have here is a smart mystery that is driven forward by a romantic history that we care about. This should lead to a ""reveal"" that brings everything together in the sort of way that those who have enjoyed The Usual Suspects will appreciate. However stage by stage it all fell down for me. Firstly we are handed a childish ""love"" that we are asked to care about  understandably I didn't at this point but I looked to it to be made real for me in the adult stage of the characters. Of course it seems that the writers told nobody about this because the relationship is never convincing and as such this emotional hook into the film doesn't catch  it probably didn't help that Norton and Biel go as well together as ice cream and syphilis.<br/><br/>So this left me with the mystery inherent in the plot. Sadly this failed to interest me either. The magic aspect of it took it beyond my interest simply because, by being set in the world where ""anything is possible or can be made to appear possible"" I knew that the film could really do whatever it wanted to do. This was further reason why the narrative failed to draw me in and, not only that, but I actually found it quite dull as I found myself caring less how the couple made their getaway (I assumed) or what would happen. The final few minutes of the film is evidence of the failure to engage as we are given what was clearly intended to be an ending with the impact of The Usual Suspects  where the entire film is shifted in a ""reveal"" that only served to make a good film even better. However here nothing is really revealed and it left me wondering what the ""solution"" that so amuses Uhl actually was. Of course maybe I would have been more taken by the ending if I'd actually been made to care about the narrative (as I had with Suspects) but, as mentioned  I didn't.<br/><br/>It is not that it is a bad film, just more that it was like a dud that never actually fired for me. Having said that though the one area where it did engage me was the cinematography. For a film dealing with what is real and what is not, I thought the decision to use bold colours was a good one as it made everything seem almost overly real and tangible in a way where real ""reality"" is much more grittier and less impressive than that which is presented as such. Visually the rather stiff cast fit in with this visual creation but otherwise they do mostly come off dull and stiff. Together they are poor but individually neither Norton or Biel offer much. The latter was no surprise to me but seeing Norton failing to emote was a surprise since I do rate him as an actor. He is overly stiff and as a character he offered me nothing to engage with. I almost want to assume that this was a conscious decision because the rest of the cast match this. Giamatti is flat but next to the flop that is Sewell he does appear to be giving the performance of his life.<br/><br/>A dull film then that really failed to engage or interest me. As a romance it fails as the chemistry is totally absent from the lead two while, as a mystery, the magic element actually works against it, meaning the Usual Suspect ending did nothing for me and certainly did not have anything like the impact that it was suppose to do."

","SIFF 2006, Opening Night<br/><br/>Thursday May 25, 7:00pm The Paramount Theater<br/><br/>Once upon a time a peasant boy and a princess fell in love. The boy was driven away, only to return an accomplished magician, intent on winning back the princess from the evil prince. Neil Burger's The Illusionist is as complex as a child's bedtime story but without an ounce of surprise or originality. Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is appropriately austere, mysterious and the effects used to create his stage fabrications are technically beautiful, but the story reads like a facsimile of been there, done that. Sophie (Jessica Biel) is ravishing and dewy-eyed but has little to do. Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) plays a cartoonish villain and Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is downright annoying. The concept and design are wonderful but bad Austrian accents, a disappointingly abrupt resolution and a tacked on montage revealing the true story further the disappointment in what might have been a much better film."

I saw The Prestige several months ago yet I think I will still have a hard time separating them.<br/><br/>This one was more about fantasy than magic. Granted, you aren't supposed to be able to figure out how tricks are done, but when most everything shown is obviously accomplished through CGI it takes away from the verisimilitude. It bugs me when a major factor in the movie (the locket) is an impossibility. There is no way it could be twisted and adjusted and the picture inside could remain intact. It's not magic, it's ""movie magic"".

","gosh what an awful film, really disappointing. no panache, no charisma, no genuine feeling of magic, just dull dull dull. i had just watched edward norton in the superlative ""the painted veil"" so i was expecting far far better than this. the script was absolutely dire with some of the most banal mediocre clichéd utterly lacklustre dialogue known to man and the acting is so drab all round that nothing can lift it. what is missing? it is not understated, it is just incredibly boring and irritating. and duh - eisenheim is told by his manager that the crown prince is a bit of a wife-beater, and sophie herself tells him that if they ran away together the crown prince would hunt them down and kill them - so what does she do? play along with him to his face & run away in secret? oh no dearie me no, she has a bit of a row with him and tells him exactly what she thinks of him and what she is planning to do. and then no doubt is a trifle surprised to find herself dead on the back of a horse (which isn't credible even taking into account the ridiculous denouement. The problem with this sort of magic is that it is so downright unbelievable so who gives a damn about any of the cardboard characters). everything about this film is second rate, even the lovely edward norton sent me to sleep - he manages to imbue his character with no charisma, no mystery, nothing - just mumbles his way apologetically through the whole film . ignore all the rubbish people write about this film, it is cr*p. oh yes and all that candlelight effect is so tedious."
"rajdoctor","4","8","12","7 January 2007"," Illusionist
","I thought that the movie must be good because it was made from the producers of ""The Crash"".<br/><br/>The movie is a love-story about a young carpenter boy who is in love with a duchess, but is separated. He comes back as a reputed magician when the duchess is about to marry a prince - a 'to become' emperor. The director tries to bring in the romance, suspense, love, hate, jealousy, arrogance and ego in divulging the nuances of various characters. I think to a certain extend he succeeds  but to a major part of the film he does not. Most of the actors are over-board in their expressions; especially the main lead Edward Norton  who is as wooden face as one could be. The only interest arises in the film when Rufus Sewell with his negative performance as the prince is on the screen  even though he also is at times overboard in his acting. A little mention is required of Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector who builds up an interesting character; but again overacts.<br/><br/>Does the magician manage to get his childhood girlfriend back is the question. The director builds up the suspense and in the last 5 minutes discloses it so rapidly that we as audience are left short of fulfillment. The set up of the movie is in the late 19th century  which is well captured. All the magic tricks shown are unusual and only appeals at the moment of seeing it on screen, but does not convince the audience. Knowing that it was not the mandate of the director to show the techniques behind some tricks, but when the suspense is hastily disclosed there are so many questions unanswered  on how did the hero manage to perform such a feat.<br/><br/>Not much more to say."
"califkid","Null","14","24","14 October 2006"," This movie is ridiculous
","Eisenheim is a consummate professional. He leaves nothing to chance in his tricks. They are well-thought out and cannot be figured out. That's why his plan to save Sophie is so ridiculous. What if the Crown Prince doesn't follow her out to the barn? What if the Crown Prince kills her in the main house? What if the drug that Sophie gives him works too soon and he collapses in front of the guard outside the barn? You mean to tell me that a drug is so precise that they know he will pass out as soon as he gets in the barn, assuming he even follows her? What if the Crown Prince doesn't kill himself in the end? In all instances, the illusion would come to a quick end. Does this sound like a plan that a genius like Eisenheim would come up with? A script that builds a plan based on several unlikely events happening is a bad script. Plain and simple. You people are suffering from The Halo Effect. Just because Norton is a great actor and the cinematography is good, doesn't mean that the underlying story is good. And from a structural standpoint, this script repeats itself every ten minutes in Act 2. I was bored during the movie, and when the great 'reveal' was made, I was just disgusted that the writer/director assumed that so many people would suspend their common sense. However, he was right."
"jemcclatchey","4","9","14","27 January 2007"," Sadly disappointed
","This film was extraordinarily beautiful in many ways but the story was disappointingly trite in the sense and style of a romantic film. The sound track, costumes, sets, husbandry, lighting and of course the classical style of cinematography and use of close-ups were extraordinary. However, it's a shame that such awesome locations and excellent actors are in a film where the hair department can't make a realistic mustache for the prince. Furthermore the ""magic"" was only an illusion for the fact that it was all computer generated. The orange tree illusion or a similar illusion should have been mystifying on its own merit as it should have respected the time period of this film and not depend entirely and wholly on a special effects department. The creative talent of this film came close but sadly missed the mark. Most certainly this is a one time only kind of film."
"leoneangelica","4","12","20","1 February 2007"," A disappointment compared to 'The Prestige'
","What a shame that two magic-related films were released at approximately the same time, and that this one came first in the US, deterring cinephiles from checking out Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige,' a far superior film on all counts. Both films are mysteries dealing with a troubled magician and a dead woman in turn-of-the-century Europe, but the similarities stop there. <br/><br/>Too bad that the talents of Philip Glass were wasted on this film. The music was excellent, but the only other thing this film has going for it is the scenery. The plot is lame and unoriginal. The love story and characters are hardly developed to render them believable. The script is terrible. The accents are ridiculous. What are these people, British or Austrian? Or, like the messenger kid at the end of the film, American? <br/><br/>Not much could really be expected from Jessica Biel, but even Norton's acting was cringeworthy (notably during the scene where he pulls ""Sophie"" from the water). At least for his part, Giamatti made do with the lousy script, like he had to in 'Lady in the Water.' <br/><br/>The kids might appreciate the fairly elementary plot and simple language of 'The Illusionist' like they would be amazed by sleight-of-hand and card tricks. However, adults, don't bother with this film - get 'The Prestige' for a real magic show: a skillfully crafted, spectacularly entertaining mystery/thriller."
"quatermax-1","7","10","16","8 February 2008"," Like the movies themselves, all smoke and mirrors...
","Movies are like buses. You wait for ages and then two come along at once. Take, for example, DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon (cobbled together these two would have made a decent movie, which separately, neither of them did), or ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES and Bergin's ROBIN HOOD. Strangely, or perhaps magically, it's the same with movies about late 19th century magicians. In September/October 2006, within ten days of each other, we had THE ILLUSIONIST and THE PRESTIGE, both tales of rivalry, revenge and the quest to discover the secrets behind the magic.<br/><br/>Childhood sweethearts Eisenheim and Sophie, peasant's son and aristocrat respectively, are forbidden to meet because of the class difference between them. Eisenhiem travels the world and returns to Vienna a world renowned stage magician. Sophie by this time is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold. Leopold is fascinated by Eisenheim's 'tricks' and orders a private performance so that he might demonstrate his cleverness to his peers by exposing Eisenheim. The magician however turns the tables during this 'demonstration', and, having been made a fool of in front of his colleagues, and especially Sophie, Leopold enlists Inspector Uhl to discover the secrets behind Eisenheim's magic and/or shut him down. Tragedy eventually and inevitably strikes and Eisenheim turns his skills toward the thwarting of Leopold's political plans and his complete downfall.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot and the period is captured superbly. There were a few slow passages but the ensemble cast work well together, particularly Sewell and Giamatti. Norton does have moments of looking spaced out rather than enigmatic, but the ending was totally satisfying and, to me at any rate, completely unanticipated, which makes a pleasant change.<br/><br/>A superior film in my view to THE PRESTIGE, which veered into Mary Shelley/science fiction territory, whereas the magic in THE ILLUSIONIST is simply that  illusion. Like the movies themselves, all smoke and mirrors.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The trailer and two male leads for this one made it a must see. What we get is an incredibly stylish, cool work of art ... and a decent (not great) film. Director Neil Burger, whom I know nothing about, has obviously studied Hitchcock and some of the great period pieces in Hollywood history. His lighting and shot selection are beautiful.<br/><br/>What is missing here is a captivating, suspenseful story line. Really only two half-developed sub-plots exist. The first one is, will the Police Inspector (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti) ""catch"" Eisenheim (a mesmerizing performance by Edward Norton) in the tricks of his illusions? The second, and much less interesting, is the odd love story between the long ago adolescent friends (Norton and Jessica Biel). This second story is borderline preposterous as we are supposed to believe some unbreakable bond occurred between these two at age 14 that even 15 years apart (and maturity and life lessons) could not break.<br/><br/>Missing suspense aside, this is a very entertaining film thanks to the style of the film and the joy of watching two of our best working actors - Norton and Giamatti. We actually sense Norton's pain throughout and Giamatti again wreaks eternal resignation to his plight. Also adding to the fun is popcorn evil bad guy, The Crown Prince, played well enough by Jude Law lookalike Rufus Sewell. Luckily, Biel's contribution is limited to big hair, big lips, a big smile and very few lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>The spiritualism of this era in Venice is touched upon, but actually very little historical significance is given to the Illusionists of the time, who were worshiped by the masses until they were exposed and then deposed.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing, but disappointing due to its lack of story breadth and substance."

","With mixed reviews and opening closely to another magic film 'The Prestige' it is with trepidation I go to watch 'The Illusionist' and unfortunately the reviews were right. Ed Norton, complete with magical training prior to the role, is OK as the mephisto type conjurer and Paul Giamatti is brilliant as the Chief of police but elsewhere Jessica Biel is stale and Rufus Sewell as the prince spend most of his screen time looking like Kenny Everret. The story is basically a rehash of Romeo and Juliet and is so incredibly simple in its execution that the twist pretty much smacks you in the face. With very little plot and annoying voice-overs the film doesn't even benefit from a score by Phillip Glass and the fact that most of it is filmed in a sepia tinged haze, I imagine to suggest it is set in the past, makes it all the more frustrating to watch. What is quite a nice idea could have been handled better and would have resulted in an interesting movie; sadly it just ends up as boring and ultimately a big let down."

","In spite of the fact that this movie holds one's interest every second, and that the ending is never guessed at, it failed to find a wide audience. This can be attributed to the fact that there was no sex, no violence, no explosions, no four letter words and no ear-shattering music, which appears to be what drives most movies today. This is a real contender for the Oscar for best picture and there are several contenders for best actor. The authenticity of the settings adds greatly to the feeling of the movie, most of it having been filmed in older sections of Prague. It is best to see this movie when one knows a minimum about the story, so that the utterly unexpected ending can have a maximum effect."

Now that you got that off your mind, here's what the movie does have. Despite the mostly unfamiliar, at least to me, cast, the acting is great. The dialogs match the quality of the acting, and don't get me started on the script. The settings, the soundtrack, the lightning, all create the atmosphere of the time portrayed.

After that you know what... he tries to run away with her even though she's engaged to the Crown Prince. So don't expect complex and mind blowing intrigues.<br/><br/>What I believe to be the appealing part of the movie was the plot around the boy chases girl thing. The great magic tricks along with a solid structure are what the film is all about. After all, a credible scenario along with intelligent and creative ideas are enough reasons to make it a good movie.<br/><br/>Having Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti amongst the cast is just a proof that the acting is top notch. You can't even complain about Jessica Biel as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>The soundtrack sets the ambiance just right, so thumbs up for the whole environmental aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>Basically a great film, although I recommend it when you're in a mood for a non-existent-action mystery/romance flick."

And at the end, which I will not reveal of course, I was particularly pleased with how brilliant the plot became.

The costumes were beautiful, the music was lush and atmospheric, and the story was delightfully convoluted. Though set in Vienna, much of the movie was filmed in Prague; it deserves its reputation as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.

My only concern was Jessia Beil, she doesn't seem like the old day's type of a movie actress. She was kind of a bummer to the film, she couldn't keep up with a British accent, but she didn't do too bad of a job. But it's the others who truly keep this amazing film going.<br/><br/>The story is about a man, Eisenheir(spelling?), he is an illusionist/magician, and we aren't just talking pulling a rabbit out of a hat, he does the most amazing tricks that would make you think that he was made of magic. But it is the duchess played by Beil who steals his heart and they have a scandalous affair since she is engaged to the emperor's son. When she attempts to leave him, she is murdered by his hand, and the chief inspector tries to find out who the murderer is. When Eisenheir starts to do amazing beyond the dead images to the public including his love, he gets into big trouble, but plays all the men with his amazing acts into a great ending! <br/><br/>I really hope The Illusionist does well at the awards ceremony, it deserves it. Believe me when I say that this is one of the best films I have seen in 2006, considering what we have had, I'm extremely happy that Hollywood brought us a great and unique story.

But once the movie got past that, it was quite easy to overlook.<br/><br/>The magic is excellent, by the way. The traditional stage illusions are well done and the special effect illusions are not big and overpowering; they add to the overall depth, not detract from it.<br/><br/>The final illusion is very, very well thought out and very well executed.

","In the year that brought us one over-sized dreadful picture after another -- trash like Peter Jackson's awful $150 million King Kong and Jerry Bruckheimer's Halloween Squid Mask pirate movie -- along comes this very special and wonderful movie playing without fanfare in just a few theaters.<br/><br/>The basic story was engrossing, and was enhanced by Grade A acting by Edward Norton and others, outstanding cinematography, prolonged suspense. As a person not usually taken with magic, the 19th century tricks were astounding; but juxtaposed against a great story of one special and talented man's pursuit of his long ago pre-adolescent love. This movie grabs hold from the first moments and never lets go.<br/><br/>Contrary to my opinion was that of the Washington Post, whose critic found the film slow-moving. One more reason that thinking persons of the 21st century prefer the Washington Times.<br/><br/>We drove 40 miles to see this movie at Baltimore's Art Deco Senator Theatre, a real movie theater, rather than a once-again visit to the local multiplex. What a treat to see the year's finest film in a place where films were intended to be seen, in an essentially adult-oriented atmosphere."

","Read the Plot Outline and Synopsis first to better understand my review.<br/><br/>Ed Norton as the Illusionist and Paul Giamatti playing the Chief Inspector who is torn between his duty to the Crown Prince and of a growing respect towards Ed Norton's character, Eisenheim. This movie contains fine acting by Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti; both show exceptional skill in portraying their roles, with a nod towards Giamatti. I think this is one of the best performances from Giamatti. Rufus Sewell plays his part of the Crown Prince exceptionally well and one cannot leave a theater or watch at home without finding a bit of contempt for his character. Jessica Biel has a good performance, but she does not seem altogether in character for her part.<br/><br/>The movie itself has a fine screenplay; it is neither too long nor too short. There are no loose ends as some movies always have. The cinematography is good but not great and the period costumes and background are nice, not overwhelming but very believable.<br/><br/>This film is worthy of your attention and will hold it until the end. This movie was released around the same time as the movie The Prestige. In my opinion the Illusionist is the better picture, even though I might add that The Prestige is a very good film as well."

","While I found this film watchable, I also found it to be rather flat. It was pleasantly shot, but I think I would have been rather more excited at the conclusion of a Sigmund Freud biopic set in Vienna. The Illusionist was more than a touch maudlin and I couldn't help but feel that Philip Glass' score was a retread of many other scores he has put together in the past.<br/><br/>Norton carried the film exactly as I expected: I wasn't surprised and I didn't end up feeling particularly connected. This movie was a predictable romantic period piece with a little bit of cgi thrown-in to spice the paste. Overall I left feeling that this will be one of those films mostly forgotten after a years time. <br/><br/>For a movie with so much magical content, it didn't manage to leave any with me to take home or remember."

","Fascinating drama and powerful love story. Audiences in turn-of-the-century Vienna are stunned, mesmerized and gravitate to the acclaimed illusionist Eisenheim(Edward Norton). The mysterious magic man draws the attention of Crown Prince Leopold(Rufus Sewell), who feels that he and his title has been besmirched; when his intended, Sophie von Teschen(Jessica Biel),assists the magician with an illusion, Eisenheim and the lovely young woman realize they had a childhood romance. Suspense builds as the Prince assigns the city's chief inspector(Paul Giamatti)to shut Eisenheim down. Sophie is found dead and a high profile investigation begins.

","First of all, showing ""magic-tricks"" in a movie is somewhat dead and pointless idea to begin with. At least they should never be the main issue, AT LEAST so that no explanation is given to a (film)viewer despite their often supernatural elements, like especially in this case. (""The Prestige"", though also very flawed film, anyway showed us what was happening behind (and under) the sets too.) But these malfunctions aside, even outside the stage there's not much to say about the plot anyhow, only that it's shallow and predictable.<br/><br/>But what really makes this film utterly a failure is terrible handling of its character-development and realization. Yes, there are moments people are obviously trying very hard to show emotions, but none of those moments ring true, none. In a film like this, where all kinds of illusions are the king, all the more important it'd be to have lively and genuine performances and characters. Jessica Biel looks pretty but as an actor she's totally transparent. There's nothing happening inside her. Sadly, same goes for Mr Norton here too. He's in his role of a great magician also outside his act so much that every time he tries to break out from his numbness it's too late and unbelievable. (As a matter of fact, Edward Norton, one of the greatest actors of the 90's, has been frighteningly disappointing for the last 5 yrs or so.) Rufus Newell as a Crown Prince, unknown to me and by this performance, remains so. And finally Paul Giamatti. He should only concentrate on comedy, rolling those big eyes just don't do the ""trick"" anymore, especially here as a Chief of Police. He's no hero and is a little bit too weak and small and overweight even for Everyman.<br/><br/>The movie was produced by the same guys who did Sideways and Crash, both enormously overrated films too. But character-wise, The Illusionist is actually very fitting continuation. Weak, weak, weak. And director is someone called ""Burger"". Well, for me that name is only half right..."
"Tony43","Null","13","24","25 August 2006"," Lacks magic
","This is a passable period piece, a film set around the turn of the last century in Vienna. Its about the star crossed romance between a Duchess and a poor boy who makes good on the stage as a magician. Its nicely mounted,well directed by Neil Burger and mildly engaging.<br/><br/>But it could have been a much better film, if it had undergone a serious rewrite, been better cast and had its feel good, montage ending reedited.<br/><br/>The core of the story is the illusionist played blandly by Edward Norton. While glib on stage and good under pressure, he is nonetheless a nondescript magician without any engaging character traits. He is neither a tortured mystic struggling to cope with his powers, nor a skillful conman using his talents to make a killing duping audiences. He's simply a quiet success. Too quiet. He is not a larger than life character and that seriously hurts the entertainment value of the film, for he seems to be a man with no major motivations, no big goals he's trying to achieve. He doesn't even seem all that fascinated with his magic.<br/><br/>Seeing him in blandness and raising him is Jessica Biel as the Duchess. She is beautiful, but about as uninvolved a princess in an ivory tower as you will see in a film. Her big scene in which she breaks up with the abusive Austrain prince she is engaged to is almost unbelievably dull.<br/><br/>The lone exception to the blandness rule that controls this film is Paul Giamatti, who plays a Vienna police detective fascinated with Norton's magic tricks, but forced by politics to play ball with the demented prince.<br/><br/>Giamatti goes in the other direction, mugging for the camera at every opportunity, and actually almost going into a parody mode at the end of the film as he ""figures it all out."" For a hint about how to play the important third party --especially if he is a detective -- see Edward G. Robinson's performance in ""Double Indemnity.""<br/><br/>The film is not without merit, and the action moves the picture along with few dead spots. Nonetheless, you can't help feeling that this is a picture about magic that lacks magic, both literally and symbolically."
"n-mo","1","33","73","8 September 2006"," The Pretentionist
","My friend Rob asked me to tell him about the film The Illusionist. I answered that I was quite impressed by the way those Viennese spoke perfect English throughout the whole movie. He concurred with my frustration: ""Plausibility is a major problem for me with a lot of movies."" Obviously not every movie requires plausibility to work, but The Illusionist, wants us to take it far too seriously to allow such suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Set in the last decades of the splintering Austro-Hungarian Empire, this film tells the story of Eisenheim, a talented magician who is in love with his childhood friend Sophie, destined to become by marriage Kronprinzessin über Österreich-Ungarn. (I used more High German in that last sentence than any character during the two hours of the film.) Actually, they were in love since childhood, but her parents objected, being as she was an aristocrat in love with a peasant.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? One thinks of The Princess Bride, The Notebook, Titanic, or any other tale of forbidden cross-class love. One would think we got the point by now. But The Princess Bride had a sort of romantic wholesomeness about it, The Notebook had provincial New World charm and a nice twist and even Titanic at least boasted a fun setting and a host of impressive visual effects. The Illusionist tries to emulate some of that but fails miserably. If the story of Titanic was wanting in believability, the very setting of The Illusionist is mentally insulting. The costumes are good and the special effects are fun but there is no flashy cinematography showing off the splendor of the Empire.<br/><br/>Indeed, one would scarcely be aware that this is Imperial Austria we are dealing with if it weren't for the subplot of Kronprinz Leopoldan abusive alcoholic woman-beaterhatching a plot to overthrow his father with the help of his fiancée. (Regarding the writers' treatment of this man, enough has been said by other and better reviewers such as Erik Gloor. I shall let the dry disconnect of my style speak for itself.) Leopold grows to hate Eisenheim one night after the magician gives him a spin of anxiety during a magic trick and his animosity is, needless to say, not helped by the discovery that his fiancée is sleeping with the man. Then when Sophie attempts to leave him, we see her riding out of his country estate on a horse limp and blood-stained. At this point we began to wonder if perhaps the writers did have some spunkthey actually killed the girl, and with a whole hour left! Alas, it is not to be.<br/><br/>There is a rather sketchy anti-monarchical undertone about this movie, difficult to articulate due to its incoherence, but we can be sure it's there. Some readers will take objection to my criticism on the grounds that this was not the main theme of the movie, which is true, but the creators took that theme far enough to warrant critical examination of their treatment. As in Titanic and The Notebook, we are supposed to be outraged because the aristocratic classes possess a sort of unwarranted snobbery acting as the main obstacle to our protagonists' heartfelt ambitions (yawn), but while those films simply played off the concept of class segregation, The Illusionist actually makes statements against aristocracy but at best halfhearted attempts at continuity and consistency from layer to layer. When the magician attempts to prove that Leopold murdered his lover and is a traitor to his father, the chief of police advises him that he ""cannot bring down the monarchy."" (By exposing a traitor to the crown? Maybe there's some sort of irony here, but to me it's plain stupid.)<br/><br/>It gets worse. When the magician's tricks turn to apparent divination, the humanists hail the end to this horrible period of scientific rationalism and the ushering in of a new ""spiritual republic"" to replace the old empirethe writers assuming, quite rightly, that an American audience would miss the ironic stupidity. (Rationalism and materialism likened to a Catholic monarchy? I doubt it.) And then they subsequently undermine their repudiation of monarchy when Eisenheim later advises his loyal followers that his spectacles are indeed mere tricks and not truly spiritual experiences, which should impart upon us that it would be wrong to follow the spiritual path to the enlightened republic. So what was the point of showing the humanists' lightweight oration? Putting the story in context clearly went out the window long ago.<br/><br/>But they don't stop there. At the end it becomes clear how much they take our gullibility for granted. The Kronprinz, his conspiracy exposed by his man-in-arms the Chief of Police and standing accused of murder, shoots himself. Then the Chief realizes via a hint that the death of Sophie wassurprise!yet another illusion on the part of the great Eisenheim! And we finish with our magician riding off to the countryside, where his loverregrettably, very much not deadhas traded the tasteful gowns she ported throughout the movie for a nice pair of riding pants. Women's liberation! Freedom and democracy! Down with Danubian tyranny! What exactly is the message here? That the virtues of liberation can be attained by deliberately implicating a man in a crime that never took place? Why should we desire to attain such liberation? More fundamentally, why should we have any sympathy with these most disingenuous protagonists?<br/><br/>What we have here is a hypocritically moralizing tome set against an Anglophone Habsburg Empire. The stage entertainment is amusing, but you're definitely better off investing in tickets to an actual magic show. The real illusion in The Illusionist stems not from the magic tricks, but from the fact that, like Titanic, it looks historical and classy and so dupes its audience into believing they are taking part in something highly culturedonly in this case, there is no effective recapturing even in part of either history or class. It's so pretentious and implausible that even its pretension strains plausibility."

","This is a film about love and magic. The thing is the magic that is performed in this movie makes it seem like it's real magic and doesn't really give the benefit of the doubt for the audiences in the movie that watches the magician at work. Although most people don't believe in magic in real life and in this film, so they try their best in this story to doubt it as much as possible. When I first saw pictures of this film in a magazine hyping this film up, it worked for me I really liked the premise of it all which involves a magician. And especially because it has Edward Norton in it, who is one of my favorite actors. And for the most part it meet my expectations. This film is magnificent and mesmerizing at times, with a good amount of mystery behind it while it's played off very well. 2006 was really a good year for movies about magic, cause another magnificent film ""The Prestige"" which was a real thrill ride. Ed Norton is magical and mysterious in a good way and Paul Giamatti put on a excellent performance playing the Chief Inspector.

"jboothmillard","7","2","2","11 July 2010"," The Illusionist
","This is meant to be some of kind romantic film, I will be honest though I was paying much more attention the reason for the title, i.e. all the magic stuff. Basically a young man in a lower class is in love with a girl in a higher class, and she loves him for his magic tricks, and the parents are disapproving, and they are split being caught. Years later, in Vienna, they have both grown up, Eisenheim (Edward Norton) has grown into a successful stage magician, Sophie (Jessica Biel) the Duchess Von Teschen expected to marry the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Eisenheim is performing tricks and illusions that no-one can seem to find the secrets of, and he is being invited to many special occasions to astound people, including for the Crown Prince. Being reunited with Sophie is obviously causing some friction, but Eisenheim's magic is making much more people become concerned almost for their safety. Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is the one investigating complaints about the magic having no explanation, and it becomes really strong concern when Eisenheim seems to be speaking to ghosts that the audience can see. It is when Sophie dies and he ""raises"" her spirit on stage that he has officially gone too far and is arrested, as far as I can remember there is some evidence that the Crown Prince was found to be involved with her murder. Also starring Edward 'Eddie' Marsan as Josef Fischer, EastEnders' Jake Wood as Jurka and Tom Fisher as Willigut. If I had paid a little more attention to the romantic element I may have got the story as a whole, but I'm not really too bothered, American actors Norton, Biel and Giamatti all put on impeccable English accents, the magic tricks with the help of some special effects make for great viewing, certainly a most watchable period romantic fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Very good!"

(Like some of the magic tricks may seem so amazing that you may wonder if an illusionist can really do that) The story is simple. The dialog is average, nothing especially impressive. No problem with the cast.Biel is beautiful and Norton is always the good actor I remember him. This is not a story that you can do a character study or anything like that. But it's magical. Somehow all the elements weaved together keep me interesting all the way through. But the best was the plot twist at the end. I wasn't expecting it and was very, very satisfied. However, like I told you, don't expect something serious like 'The Prestige'. This movie is pure 'magic', more of a fantasy mixed with romance.<br/><br/>After the film finished, I felt like I've just watched a great magician performing some amazing tricks.

","Anybody who has read the user comments on ""The Illusionist"", will probably notice that its a love-hate affair. To some it is thoroughly uninspired, boring and predictable - to the others its entertaining, smart and enjoyable.<br/><br/>This entirely depends on your state of mind when you start watching ""The Illusionist"": if you willingly place yourself in the position of Eisenheim's audience, letting his hypnotic personality lead you (as well as Norton's exceptional acting), you are sure to enjoy the movie, to the full extent. However if you always look for mistakes, and approach every moment with the disbelief of a critic, ultimately you will spoil the major twists and end up feeling that the movie is nothing special.<br/><br/>The Illusionist's best trait is that it isn't too ambitious for its own good. It attempts a love story, mixed with mystery and a sprinkle of the supernatural - and it succeeds in all of these things. Told with a fairy tale like quality, without any political, pseudo-philosophical or other today usual, movie ""baggage"", it aims to entertain in the purest sense of the word.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" has very few characters, but they are all very well realized. Norton as usual steals the show, given his enormous talent, and effort he puts into each role. Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel surprised me with the quality of their acting, given that my opinion of them wasn't really high. However, they did their roles well, and I will look in on their films in the future.<br/><br/>Other notable high points of the movie are: excellent cinematography, fantastic music and a decidedly ""old school"" approach to movie making that pours out of ""The Illusionist"", which would have been nothing special in Hollywood a few decades ago, but today is entirely refreshing (especially the lack of any ""usual baggage"").<br/><br/>The verdict?

","I can't really remember the last time I was so amazed by the quality and development of a movie. Not just flabbergasted, but filled with awe as the story was constructed inside a most meticulously brilliant frame.<br/><br/>I say first meticulous because the film excels in every aspect imaginable. All of the production values contribute discreetly to give the film that taste, like inhaling deep beauty all around. Scrupulous and beautiful art direction; from the dusty lamps; to the sculpted street scenarios, to the wonderful wardrobe election, fonded on careful creation. The photography is also remarkable, let's give it the honor, of imposing a dry, sepia like tone all over and mastering the precise quantity and quality of colors to amuse the spectator and drown him into the story, helped by a cohesive, narrow editing. Neil Burgess shows his study on films, as I was interested in seeing the now rare closing on iris, used in some scenes fading the image in a black, circled vortex. That was used in the pre-50 movies. ""Some of the tricks transcend the illusion and approach art"" claims Norton's character. Well, art is reached with this breathtaking production afore mentioned.<br/><br/>Actings, on the other hand, are brutally calculated: like Giamatti's pondering ordinary charm, and Norton exuding elegance all the way on. Sewell's villain potency and Biel's charm, beauty, mesmerizing looks and so on. Oh, and I forgot! The music is sincerely spectacular, inviting the viewer to close eyes in order to truly hear it. Some ups and downs of a piano make an absolutely astonishing score that adds to the movie.<br/><br/>If ""The Prestige"" (unevitable comparison) was a dark, gritty but fantastic approach at magic ""The Illusionist"" is delicious, exceptionally presented and a lot more sweet on edges, with a romantic story finely scripted. The spiritualism messages are beyond my interest, but adds to the movie's utter bright karma.<br/><br/>I wasn't surprised like these since a long shot, since ""Spirited Away"". Maybe because I wasn't aware of the hype. But the movie will be presented as a puzzle, with many hints to solve a faltering mystery. Appearances may lie, may not lie. The true illusion lies in how deep does the viewer believe this story. Movies are an illusion, right? <br/><br/>Fantastical, Incredible, Brutal, Mesmerizing. Can think of many more words. Please see it."
"rmax304823","8","2","2","19 September 2007"," Outstanding.
","What a splendid team effort this film represents. The direction and the performances are fine, and they're lifted well above the simply ""fine"" by the art direction, set dresser, photographer, and by Philip Glass's most aptly otherworldly score. Even Prague, frozen in time, the perennial stand in for turn-of-the-century Vienna, looks more authentic than it has before.<br/><br/>The story involves the rivalry between the evil and ambitious Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary (Rufus Sewell) and a humble cabinet maker's son (Edward Norton) who has turned into a world famous stage magician or ""illusionist"") for the love of a young noblewoman (Jessica Biel). It's well written and acted. Sewell could have turned the Prince into a maniac frothing at the mouth but instead has kept him a quietly smug heavy who mostly keeps his violence under wraps. Jessica Biel is competent and not too beautiful as the prize, although, to be sure, judging from her appearance as a child, she should have grown up to be Cate Blanchett instead of Jessica Biel. Edward Norton, just when you think he's exhausted his bag of thespian tricks, comes up with another fresh character, this time intelligent, confident, elliptical, enigmatic.<br/><br/>The special effects deserve a prize. After the supposed murder of Jessica Biel's character, Norton appears again on stage, but this time not in tails but shirtsleeves and without props -- no cane, no fluttering doves, no top hat concealing an albino rabbit -- not even an introduction. He sits alone before the audience, saying nothing, raises his open palm and an apparition slowly appears. We know it's all process photography, yet through the sensory impressions left by the visuals and the score, it turns into a very spooky moment. The rumor spreads that Norton has made a Faustian pact and it gets him into even more trouble.<br/><br/>I won't go on with this, I don't think. ""All will be revealed,"" as Charlie Chan used to say, or was it Hercule Poirot? I can't say the plot is entirely successful but I can say that there haven't been that many more beautiful movies lately."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","2","25 May 2007"," Good movie but definitely a case of style over substance.
","No doubt that ""The Illusionist"" is one of the best looking movies of 2006. Great sets, costumes, cinematography and such but the story left me mostly cold and in fact was quite poorly told and developed at times. So definitely a case of style over substance this one but what a great style it is.<br/><br/>What I especially loved about the movie was its authentic feeling. The movie was made in fairly much the same style as back in the early days of cinema. Of course all of the sets and costumes and such also add to the authentic feeling of the overall movie. Neil Burger obviously has a love for the movies from the early days of cinema.<br/><br/>I however found to be the story quite simplistic, with a love-story also done in about the same way as in the earliest movies. It's admirable but not really good and interesting enough for an 21th century movie. The story also doesn't bother to explain everything, which leaves a lot to the viewers its own imagination and assumptions. Its a good way to make a movie but in this case it just leaves a bit too many questions in the end. The movie is also lacking too much in proper tension, mystery and real surprises. I for one already exactly knew how this movie was going to end halve way through the movie. <br/><br/>The story and overall movie also don't always get properly developed. It's like the movie is stuck at times and Neil Burger still has got a lot of learning to do when it comes down to telling a story exciting, intriguing and suspenseful. The story now just couldn't grab me, though I guess that in its core it had potential. Perhaps the movie felt like it was stuck at times because of the reason that the movie is mostly set at constantly the same locations, for most part. The movie also uses its special effects too much as a tool to tell the story with. It's in huge contrast with the authentic feel of the movie. It takes away some of the 'magic' of the movie, since you just know its not real and not a real magic trick you're looking at. It also takes away some of the charm of the movie and its subject.<br/><br/>The best action and intriguing aspect from this movie comes from Paul Giamatti as Inspector Uhl, though his character really doesn't get developed in the best way possible. His character constantly changes during the movie. At times you like him, at times he's more the villain and at times he just confuses you what his motivations are. Nevertheless, Paul Giamatti is absolutely fantastic in his role and he also shows how incredible versatile as an actor he is. I wouldn't had mind him seeing being nominated for an Oscar again for his role in this movie. But of course opposing is Edward Norton who also does more than a great job as the main character of the movie.<br/><br/>But before I'm starting to sound too negative; ""The Illusionist"" is definitely a movie worth seeing, that however is too weak and simplistic to also consider it as one of the best movie in recent years, like the current rating here at the moment might suggest it is.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","When the young magician Eisenheim attempts to run away with his true love, the princess Sophie, the imposing wall of class divisions rises between them, and the star-cross'd lovers are separated. Years later, Eisenheim (Edward Norton) has risen to be the most popular - and mysterious - illusionist in Vienna, and Sophie (Jessica Biel) is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a tyrant-in-training who has designs on his father's throne as Emperor.<br/><br/>Leopold grows increasingly uneasy about Eisenheim, whose relationship to Sophie is unknown to the Crown Prince, believing that the magician is committing fraud or claiming to possess supernatural powers. What truly irks the prince, though, is that Eisenheim manages to upstage him at the Prince's own castle with a magical display that enchants his audience of the social elite. And so Leopold orders Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to investigate the illusionist closely to determine his secrets.<br/><br/>Eisenheim performs some truly astounding tricks, including growing an orange tree before the unbelieving eyes of the audience and transporting a handkerchief from a closed box in the audience to the claws of small doves on the stage. But after a truly unfortunate turn of events, his show becomes quite minimalist in scope: The Illusionist merely sits on the stage and conjures - yes, conjures - speaking, reacting ghosts to wow and astound the audience, while Eisenheim mopes about distractedly. What has happened to put him in this state cannot be explained here, unfortunately. But when Eisenheim's performances go a little too far for the Crown Prince's liking, Leopold orders Uhl to arrest the magician.<br/><br/>But this is no mere telling of unrequited love followed by the mysteries of a magician. The placid Eisenheim desperately misses his long-lost love, and when he sees her in the company of the overbearing boor Prince Leopold, he uses all of the magic at his disposal to free the beautiful Sophie from the Crown Prince. How this is ultimately accomplished constitutes the great twist in The Illusionist.<br/><br/>Norton is simply - to use a pun shamefully - spellbinding as Eisenheim, a man who uses a paucity of words, every motion calculated well in advance, every emotion kept in check, doled out in spring-loaded moments of unbridled passion. Eisenstein, in the capable hands of Norton, is a romantic, a cipher, an unknowable hero. It's a shame the movie was released during a year in which many other wonderful performances evolved on the screen, because Norton - twice nominated for Academy awards - turns in a performance that rivals those of his more-lauded roles.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Biel is pretty good - and, of course, devastatingly sexy - as the aristocrat trapped in a loveless marriage who finally finds someone worth living for and with. Of course, there's not much to be surprised about, since I haven't seen her in much, just Ulee's Gold, when she was a kid, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Still, she's hot, and it's rare that a gorgeous actress can actually show emotional range. It's a real treat, too, to watch Giamatti, who's well cast as the intrepid inspector, a role with more than a passing acquaintance with Claude Rains' Captain Renault of Casablanca, a man not above petty bribery and graft but with his own system of morals.<br/><br/>A lush, dark mystery, The Illusionist relies heavily on the splendid performances of its three youthful leads to weave wonderful threads of mystery, romance, and intrigue."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","2","2 January 2007"," An illusion and not an illusion, both
","Comparison between ""The illusionist"" and ""The prestige"" is almost inevitable. They are in fact quite different  Prestige focuses much more on magic than Illusionist. I have commented on Prestige elsewhere and will concentrate on Illusionist here.<br/><br/>After an attention-grabbing opening scene, the first half of the movie, through traditional flashback and linear narration, is a familiar rich-girl-poor-boy yarn, so traditional that it threatens to be banal but for the good acting. After being torn apart for 15 years, the childhood friends (not quite sweethearts then) re-encountered  Sophie (Jessica Biel) of a noble family now about to be married to a crown prince (Rufus Sewell) while Edward (Edward Norton) has established himself as Eisenheim the fast rising magician that captures the fancy of the Vienna audience at the turn of the century. While considerable screen time has been given to Eisenheim's career as a magician, the focus up to this point is on how Sophie and Eisenheim's old friendship has been rekindled into romance and how the crown prince is obviously the obstacle.<br/><br/>At the mid-point, however, the tone of the movie take a rather abrupt turn, giving it a new life, as a dark mystery with also a supernatural flavour. Eisenheim's magic becomes the obsessed focus of both the audience and Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who tries to unravel its mystery. After some twists and turns, however, the final revelation brings the audience to a realisation that this is a rich-girl-poor-boy story after all. Here lies the clever sleight-of-hand, in the very structure of the movie itself. It's not particularly convoluted, and more seasoned audience can probably see the ending twist coming. There are also, not unexpectedly, plot holes, as a water-tight plot is very difficult to come by. (The screenplay is actually got a nomination for an award). However, none of this stops the movie from being vastly entertaining, with a satisfactory conclusion. The whole thing is an illusion, and not an illusion, both.<br/><br/>Giamatti's role as the chief inspector does not seem to be terribly demanding at first glance, but that is the pivoting role. The story is told mostly from his POV. We need a solidly reliable anchor (perhaps like a Watson in a Holmes story although I'm not sure if it's a really good comparison) and Giamatti fills that role admirably. It's become almost blasphemous in the movie world to criticize any performance by Edward Norton, but this actor, who can play just about any role thrown at him, does deserve the distinction. His enigmatic Eisenheim is no exception. Jessica Biel, with her track record in modern-day vampire-combating and super jetfighter piloting, is surprisingly convincing in her role as a period elegant noble lady, pouting-lips charm and all. Equally good is Rufus Sewell who made a recent appearance in ""Paris, je t'aine"", in a delightful segment playing against Emily Mortimer."
"Surecure","8","2","2","22 September 2006"," Very good though not without serious flaws in logic
","'The Illusionist' is a wonderfully entertaining piece of film-making that is both beautiful to look at and engaging in its twists and turns. With an inventive script that acts as an illusion itself by defying audience expectation with a series of misdirections, 'The Illusionist' is not your typical Hollywood thriller.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw with 'the Illusionist' resides in its dependency on the audience to suspend its disbelief in the conclusion. The final pieces of the puzzle that Giamatti's character discovers are found in the straw of the Crown Prince's stable. However, the straw of that stable would have been changed several times over the course of time that would have elapsed between when those pieces were lost in the straw and when they were found. Thus, while the climax is effective in presentation, it is dulled somewhat when one questions how it was arrived at.<br/><br/>That being said, the overall value of 'The Illusionist' far exceeds whatever stumbling blocks arise in the narrative. The cinematography gives the film a classic feel that, mixed with the locations and costumes, might remind one of Milos Forman's 'Amadeus'. Neil Burger's directing is as minimalist as the Philip Glass score, which is a welcome change to the deluge of fast edits and quick-cutting that is present in too much of modern film. By allowing scenes to present themselves and giving actors space to breath on camera, Burger does not overwhelm the senses and allows the story to take precedence over the camera angles.<br/><br/>'The Illusionist' is an excellent display of cinematic talent all-around and is a tasteful digestif to this summer movie season."

Badly written, badly directly, badly photographed, and excruciatingly badly acted, there is nothing to recommend this at all. If you liked the Phillip Glass, then go out and buy the cd. Otherwise don't waste your time. One can easily why an egomaniac like Norton wanted to do this. He gets to do an 'accent'. The problem is, his English accent is abysmal at best and embarrassing at worst, and often just plain non-existent. As to the others, only Giamatti manages not to embarrass himself (except for the fact that he did this trash in the first place). As to the mystery, there is none. It's obvious from the first 20 minutes to anyone with half a brain. So the remainder of the film just slogs along to it's inevitable conclusion at a snail's pace. Hopefully, the writer/director won't soon be allowed to make another such piece of trash for some time, but I doubt that.

","Steven Millhauser's brilliant little short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist' is beautifully realized cinematically by Neil Burger who not only adapted the story as a screenplay but also directed with a great flair for the subject. Wisely using the repeated line 'Nothing is what it seems' Burger infuses this dark investigation into the lives of the divided Viennese classes and suggests the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the focus on the illusory magic of one Eisenheim (finely characterized by Edward Norton) and its effects on the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the bifurcated Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel).<br/><br/>As children Eisenheim and Sophie were friends despite the disparity of their class: Sophie was royalty (a Duchess) and Eisenheim was the son of a cabinetmaker to the court. They fall in love but are separated by caste and Eisenheim wanders Asia and Russia learning the vagaries of magic and illusionist tricks while Sophie is raised at court to become the wife of Crown Prince Leopold, whose plans to overthrow his father the Emperor to become the King of both Austria and Hungary have made him an obsessive scoundrel.<br/><br/>Years later Eisenheim enters Vienna as a showman, under the tutelage of his impresario Josef Fischer (Eddie Marsan), delighting audiences with his illusionist tricks. His impossible love for Sophie resurfaces and he becomes suspect in his role as an illusionist and as a threat tot he Crown. Eisenheim is investigated carefully by Chief Police Inspector Uhl (a brilliant role by Paul Giamatti) and the manner in which the fates of the Crown versus the love of Eisenheim and Sophie are resolved is, well, 'Nothing is what it seems'.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding, the setting (in Prague) is incredibly atmospheric, and the costuming and lighting and cinematography marry into a perfect fit. Adding to the illusionist spirit of the film is the fine musical score by Phillip Glass so well loved for his score for 'The Hours' and one of our most important classical music composers of the day. THE ILLUSIONIST is a fine, misty, dark evocation of life in La Belle Époque of Vienna, based enough on fact that the fiction employs the concept that nothing is what it seems. Grady Harp"

It was a period piece, and used sound and lensing techniques more similar to 1950 than 2006. 2: The roles were cast to people who appeared human, not gods and goddesses. 3: I have read extensively about the reactions of crowds to spiritualists of the time.

The characters weren't completely defined: for instance, i would have liked to know more about what they had done during the time Eisenheim was away.

Rufus Sewell lacked the elegance of a prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, don't get me wrong i like him very much (in Tristan + Isolde, for example).

"zkonedog","3","3","4","7 March 2017"," A ""Big Reveal"" Film From A Director Who Doesn't Get It Right
","When making a ""big reveal"" film, a top-notch director must realize that the ""reveal"" cannot be the entire picture. One must also include fair doses of character development, believable actions, & compelling drama in order to make us care enough for the reveal to actually mean something. Sadly, Neil Burger does very little of that within ""The Illusionist"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this period piece centers on stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), who conjures up apparitions that are utterly stupefying. When Sophie (Jessica Biel), the former love of his life, comes back into the equation, Eisenheim must make the decision once and for all as to whether or not they can carve out a life together despite being from completely different social classes.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that ""The Illusionist"" was clearly made with care and a very good intent, it ultimately fails to impress for two specific reasons:<br/><br/>1. There really isn't much to get invested in. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts (the human element is only ""talked"", not actually ""lived""), while the events transpiring around them are never explained (e.g. Eisenheim's actual tricks).<br/><br/>2. There is no ""grit"" to the picture whatsoever. In Christopher Nolan's masterpiece ""The Prestige"", a similar magic-themed film, the director takes you deep inside the world the characters are living in, pulling no punches along the way. We see it all...the good and the bad and all the raw emotions that result from it. In ""The Illusionist"", however, stereotypical ""class differences"" and ""the controlling husband"" are used in place of real emotion. Those stereotypes may have been true of the era, but in this case they needed to be felt instead of just referenced.<br/><br/>Overall, then, I cannot recommend this one to those who like their movies deep and full of character growth, as it is quite superficial all the way around. Yes, it does have a ""mind-blowing"" reveal, but because it fails in so many areas before that point, it loses all its credibility, so to speak. I highly recommend ""The Prestige"" as an alternative yet still containing very similar themes."

The special effects look authentic. Burger's screenplay is solid. He has given great attention to detail and the way he unfolds the story and peels the layers of his characters is remarkable. Edward Norton can proudly add 'The Illusionist' to his illustrious filmography. Paul Giamatti is stupendous. Rufus Sewell does a fine job. Jessica Biel has finally made a wise career choice and surprisingly holds her own. The story interweaves the murder mystery, the love story and Edward's passion for magic quite well.

It makes him seem like a warlock. How did he make the ""spirits"" appear? And this is more of a love story. Eisenheim love's a girl above his social class. He is forbidden to see her as a boy. He eventually travels the world and learns his craft. He comes back to win her over. Only problem is she is to marry the crown prince. She can't leave him because the prince would hunt them down and kill them.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","3","4","2 January 2007"," To compare with Nolan's The Prestige...
","Neil Burger's 'The Illusionist' would immediately fade and its magic would fritter away. The two turn-of-the-century magician tales beg a comparison and indeed they share many similarities like fractured chronology, narration, deceptive illusions, era and music score but they are ultimately two different stories focusing on two wholly different aspects of magic, rivalry between two magicians and a love triangle in the court of Vienna respectively. Although The Prestige also intertwines some romance in its story, the love side of the tapestry firmly belongs in The Illusionist where it fares best. Both films are nothing short of wonderful, The Prestige with a meticulously-composed, brutal pay-off and The Illusionist with a warm centre.<br/><br/>In the latter, two young lovers are separated by rank but brought together again fifteen years later on stage as Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is performing magic and requests an audience member to volunteer, which rekindles their illicit romance in a moment of tense chemistry and nostalgic recognition. The problem is Crown Prince Leopold (resident baddie: Rufus Sewell) who plans to wed duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel) and has no desire to lose her to a struggling magician. Through lushly sepia-tinted flashbacks we are given the sweet story of young Sophie and Eisenheim, a ploy which affirms their positions in the protagonist slots and cues the viewers in to root for them. Through tricks and twists Eisenheim engages in an intense battle of wills for his lover, with chief inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) on his tail who scratches his head trying to figure out his next magic act.<br/><br/>The Illusionist is a decidedly brighter story with likable characters and clear-cut antagonists, while The Prestige comprised of grey-zoned, selfish lead characters that only momentarily held our sympathy, only to dispel it with their pride, greed and obsessive dedication to the craft. Here the dedication is to love, to Sophie, and the theatrical magic takes a backseat to the love story. It follows then that the setting holds the same bright beauty. The dark 'Prestige' took us to the murky backstreets of London; The Illusionist sweeps across the grand gold-strewn halls of Vienna. The period and costumework are undeniably much better crafted in the latter with a screen that is awash with lyrical colours and luxury, but it may well be that Vienna is simply more of a thankful setting to lose yourself in. There is in this way a tremendous visual sense throughout 'The Illusionist', which Nolan never truly reaches in gloomy, damp The Prestige.<br/><br/>For all of its optimistic turns and beautiful outlook, The illusionist does not hold a candle to the majestic Prestige, which towers over the former on a script-level. It is a webby meshwork of magic, an ever-shifting hall of mirrors that kept us guessing throughout, and topped it off with one of the most inventive plot twists in cinematic history. The Illusionist may boast of a clever plot-turn too, but one that is infinitely more conventional and perhaps even predictable to those that pay extra attention. The acting in both films is consistent in the way that the leads are uniformly strong and that Scarlett Johansson is consistently bad in The Prestige. I had never crowned Jessica Biel a particularly capable actress but she performs well in the role of Sophie with a fair European accent. Edward Norton is intense and brooding as the layered Eisenheim with a very European-sounding accent but ultimately he is quite the dullard in the story, which is possibly Giamatti's show as the observing, narrating detective. He may be the only ""grey-zoned"" character in the film, as I first labelled him an antagonist of sorts.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have a few serious qualms with the stage 'magic' that took place in The Illusionist; certainly entertaining parlor tricks and astounding magic are performed  but these tricks are not explained in the film, only alluded to by Eisenheim's vague concession: ""Everything you have seen has been an illusion."" This is a cheap and lazy cop-out, because if you never bother to explain the magic acts, then you can basically whip out anything, CGI wonders and supernatural creations. So what? The 'mystery' genre is achieved through teasing the audience, not dishing out magical extravaganzas without hinting as to how they have been performed. Christopher Nolan realised this with the script of 'The Prestige' which he and his brother penned, and as a result the mise-en-scene of the film is its key component, letting the audience in on all the secrets... almost.<br/><br/>In conclusion it appears as though The Illusionist and The Prestige are rather different films after all. The former is smaller-scaled, lower-budgeted, sweeter and more forgettable and in all fairness, it is only its fantastic, epic score by Philip Glass that reaffirms its home on the big screen. The Prestige, by contrast, is utterly unforgettable and I am still scratching my head in awe at its meticulously-composed mystery even though I was probably equally entertained while watching the two magician stories.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 for The Illusionist. 9 out of 10 for The Prestige"

","I was captivated by The Illusionist from the very beginning. A truly beautiful film. Gorgeous cinematography, excellent cast, wonderfully complex storyline. The sepia tones of the opening credits grabbed my attention and I immediately became enthralled in the fictitious yet plausible history of the tale. I can easily see both Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton earning Best Actor nominations for their fine performances. Have either one of these gifted actors ever let us down? And Jessica Biel was very very good. I consider this a break-through role for her. She carried herself well. Her performance was understated~ which only made her character stronger. The musical score of Philip Glass is alluring. A wonderful accent to this rich film experience. Great films don't happen on their own. I'm sorry to say I am not familiar with director Neil Burger's history. But I can assure you that I will be digging in to his past and anticipating his future contributions to the art media of cinema. It has been a long time since I've been this engrossed in a film. I highly recommend The Illusionist."

This movie had a surprise ending which I will not tell you about, as it would ruin the movie for you. With all the trash that Hollywood is turning out these days it was a relief to see a well written story, and no slapstick acting by some teen age actor.

Norton has such an amazing stage prescence in this film as Eisenheim, he completely brings me to believe that he actually does have the supernatural powers some believe he does. It was most certainly an Oscar-worthy performance. Giamatti too gives a powerful and excellent performance as Inspector Uhl, bringing the entire story together. While it was somewhat shocking to see and hear him at first, he quickly merged with his character, giving another Oscar-worthy performance. The cinematography, costumes, writing, and directing were all superb. If this film does not win a number of Oscars, it will be robbed."

","It has the look of a foreign film. I thoroughly enjoyed sets, costumes and mostly, the acting by Norton and Giametti. As a writer, I tend to be somewhat jealous when I see an outstanding job as in this work.Too bad that it opened so far away from the award selections.I am unable to recall when I have last seen a picture that made me think so much about it afterwards. I predict that it will be a cult classic. Let's see more of Ed Norton.<br/><br/>A standing ovation to the special effects department. It is exciting to see a production not geared to the demographics of those under 29. While I am not a prude, I often feel that filmmakers have no concept as to how to depict sensuality as they substitute nudity for same. Guys, in the old days, it was done with cigarettes burning or clouds and lightning. It is hard too believe that in this one, they remained in good taste when dealing with sensuality."

","An excellent period piece, part fantasy, part mystery, all enjoyable. One almost expects Gandalf or Dumbledore to appear, .... Edward Norton brings the correct amount of brooding intensity to Eisenheim, while Paul Giamotti could be dogged without turning into Javert. History students and film buffs may recognize the allusions in the story to that of the real Crown Prince of Belle Epoque Austria, Rudolph Hapsburg (what do you think the hunting lodge is that is mentioned? It's Mayerling, also movie of the same name). The cinematography, with its fades and blurry edges of frame, add to the mysterious atmosphere of film. The score is haunting, who knew minimalist could be melodious?"
"mdhagins","9","3","4","3 September 2006"," cleverly disguised romance
","This movie is about magic. It is clearly about people believing what they choose to believe whether it is real or not. The magician's real trick is the ability to lead people down the path of their beliefs while messing with reality. When the trick is done, the desire to believe and the belief become the magic. That is what movies are, too. All the talent and effort of the people who make the movies go into playing off of your own ability to believe something and it is the viewers' ability to be distracted from the reality of movie-making that helps the story be successful. This film succeeds on several levels and I sat like a child being told a sophisticated bedtime story. I wanted to believe. I got pulled into the romance in a way that I don't normally because I dislike most romance movies. But this worked because the acting was so strong and the attraction felt real with an unpredictable aspect. The romance, although central to the story, became secondary to the psychology and story of the impact of illusion on everything from romance to politics to social behavior. As the magician was analogous to movie makers, the Chief Inspector Uhl becomes the audience. He needs to be critical to do his job as detective, but he, too, gets lost in his own desire to believe in mystery and the fantastic. The acting is very good, Edward Norton was particularly good I love how he expressed depth and meaning with his eyes while only revealing what he wants you to see just like the magician; Jessica Biel surprised me at being better than I expected; Rufus Sewel embodied that era and his character perfectly; and Paul Giamatti is always top notch. I also have to say that the costume design is superb. Ngila Dickson is so talented at bringing other realities and time periods to life. The story is well told. There is one weak spot at the end that almost ruins what I had thought was careful story telling, but I hate spoilers, so I will not say specifically. It has to do with a clunky montage and laughter. It seems tacked on to retell a story for dumb American audiences and the story doesn't need retelling. If people want to see it again to find the details they missed, let em. Good for the box office, you know. But other than that, this is an really entertaining well-made movie that is also beautiful to look at."

The story follows a magician (Norton, Oscar Worthy trend) who falls for a beautiful woman (Biel) in a higher social standing than himself. But when she is to be wed he uses his unique ability of the ""dark arts"" to win her love back. ""The Illusionist"" is smart and probably will end up very underrated. And of course Oscar snubbed.

"banzaicat","2","9","19","15 October 2006"," Guess I'm in minority, but The Illusionist fails on many levels
","There are many positive reviews of The Illusionist out there, which can be a bit disconcerting to one who's just seen the movie and found it to be lacking on so many levels. I have to add my review here, just to give potential movie-goers a more balanced view, and share my own experience. I appreciate that so many who liked the movie include the fact that it is different from so much Hollywood fare (different in look, content, locale), but--while these elements 'could' have made for an engaging movie--they aren't enough. Despite its old-world look, The Illusionist actually reminded me of those abundant mediocre sci-fi films that forget that despite unusual locations and visuals, a movie requires a character-driven story and effective pacing to be interesting and engaging. <br/><br/>Paul Giamatti (so outstanding in Sideways) tries to inhabit his 'inspector' role, and to create an interesting character. Edward Norton also can't be faulted for his acting. The problem is, this movie is terribly boring, and to offer a more cogent analysis, the screenplay (and/or direction) simply fail in so many areas to create any dynamic energy, give us an intimate view of characters up front that we want to follow, or create a story of real interest that pulls us in. It is wonderful that the movie is set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, but there are no panoramic shots of the city and architecture, or close-up shots of human activity and 'bustle,' that might help that location become a vibrant character in this film. There is no setup of political/historical context; later in movie we are supposed to become absorbed in political intrigue (the 'baddie' toward movie's end gives an impassioned outburst about his political mission), but we aren't familiar enough with his motives and mission, or the political climate and undercurrents of the city, to be interested. We are supposed to feel a connection to Edward Norton's character (Eisenheim,, a magician)we met him in childhoodbut there are no intimate, solitary, moments in the film to give us a sense of Norton's own connection to his childhood, or really any sense of his character or what drives him. There are magic scenes, but the movie seems to lack (again) an intimacy that would help us really feel Eisenheim's personal connection (or even obsession) to his craft, one that has surely occupied much of his time and energy, and there is a lack of real tension in most of the magic scenes. Long-shots of the audience, and their rapid-fire questions, also do little to really pull us into what could be strange and even mystical events unfolding in the room. There's a love story, and Jessica Biel is pretty. But she isn't interesting. We don't know her, on any level, or what (if anything) drives her character. Her scenes with Eisenheim lack (once again) the intimacy, or thoughtful dialog, or perhaps a slower pace, that might help us grow to feel an attachment to her. Her reaction to the 'baddie' character, who she has a relationship with, lacks substance or realism. She does not appear to be apprehensive about him, or respond to him with any amount of caution. If we could experience this tension with her, and she occasionally bravely stood up to him, we'd cheer her--but because she's always entirely unaffected, this potential device is wasted. This only contributes to another fault: the 'baddie' character is not well developed (we hear he does bad things, but we haven't seen those bad things, and we don't witness closely what drives him, so we don't feel he's particularly menacing or have much interest in him). He is merely a caricature, with occasional violent outbursts. <br/><br/>This movie is heavy on dialog between Eisenheim and the inspector, but the scenes aren't intriguing. There is nothing pulling this movie forward. The end (I'll admit) was a surprise, mainly because the movie started moving at a faster clip and seemed to be communicating something. I was not expecting much of interest to happen. But it only illustrated how much better the lead-up could have been handled. In some ways, the movie tries too hard--it has the components that make for an interesting movie, but it never gels. A very weak screenplay and weak concept seem to be the problem. (I was so bored I left for an unnecessary trip to bathroom, and also explored the Art Deco/Egyptian hieroglyphics on the wall near my theater seat.) It was simply a very weak film."
"Fred-S","10","5","9","13 January 2007"," So good I watched it over again.
","Sometimes, when a movie (on DVD) is particularly interesting and thought provoking, I watch parts of it over with director's comments turned on. In the case of ""The Illusionist"" my wife and I watched the entire movie over to hear the director's comments. <br/><br/>Clearly, as some critics complain, some of the illusions could not be done as shown in the movie (and certainly not in 1900) and the director admits he took some illusions that actually were done during the movie's time period and added to them to provide an enhanced movie effect. But, that is really picking nits in this case because the basic illusions themselves would have been adequate, in the real world, to provoke a similar response. In fact, many illusionists throughout history have done exactly that.<br/><br/>Some reviewers compare this movie to ""The Prestige"" because they are both about illusions. That is like comparing ""Saving Private Ryan"" with ""Apocalypse Now"" because they are both about war. In ""The Illusionist"" illusions are the means to an end. In ""The Prestige"" the illusions are the end. <br/><br/>The theme of this movie is that in the minds of most people, there is a fine line between illusion and reality  one need only hear discussions (such as they are) of renewable energy, nuclear power, or global warming to verify the truth in that  and writer/director Neil Burger uses a story of star-crossed lovers (a relationship which, interestingly enough, is not in the original story on which this movie is based) and Eisenheim's (Edward Norton) determination to be with his love, if only in death, as the framework for that theme. At one point in the movie (no spoiler here) the question of whether the visions Eisenheim has produced are illusion or reality is being discussed when Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) states that it doesn't matter  the result is the same. <br/><br/>Such, according to Burger, is the nature of the mind. It is often stated - and, incredibly, many people seem to be believe - that perception is reality.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is the perfect actor for this role. Norton may have no peer when it comes to using nothing but facial expressions (or lack of same) to convey thoughts and feelings, and that is all-important in this film. It is politically, and legally, necessary that Eisenheim not make claims that could be used against him, so he conveys his thoughts with body (mostly facial) language that is so strong that one feels that words have been said that, in fact, were never spoken. Similarly, he can disclaim, with strong words, any special powers knowing that the people who hear those words will continue to believe the powers exist. I did not think Paul Giamatti was right for the role of the police chief, but he handles it adequately, which is all that is necessary. Similarly, the much-maligned Jessica Biel handles her undemanding role quite well. I was surprised to hear the director say in the commentary that there was some concern about using her in the film since neither Norton nor Giamatti ""suffer fools"" very well. He said it in praise, however, because he thought Norton and Giamatti accorded her the respect they would only give to a competent performer. <br/><br/>But, this is Norton's movie. He is great in it and makes it a great movie."
"pookey56","9","5","9","10 January 2007"," now you tree it, now you don't....'
","i always enjoy Rufus Sewell in a film. He doesn't always play ""the bad guy"", but once again he isn't exactly Santa Claus here, as crown prince Leopold. There was a Leopold about that time, uncle and father-in-law to the future Queen Victoria, but this Leopold is fictitious, i'm sure. Paul Giamatti is also very good and unrecognizable from his role in SIDEWAYS. His character is intelligent, complex, and has virtue. Edward Norton is an extremely versatile and gifted actor, and for the most part, he is up to the challenge here, as a rather morose ""illusionist"" deprived of the love of his life based on his lower class background. Mess with him, mess with his powers, which, by the way, makes Harry Potter look like an amateur. the film swirls like random yet seamless time and truly does have a magical quality to it. Burger does this with heavy use of dark tones, creepy music, and elusive visions. There is a narrative going on in the background as well, lending to the rather dark ambiance of this film. This film is a blend of gender and governmental politics, vengeance, jealousy, forbidden love, heart break, amazement, a puzzle-necklace of love, and mystery. Norton's character has seeming powers which threaten the ruling class, and even the normalcy of the times. Of course, these things are often not allowed, regardless of which time in history it may be. It isn't a good idea to accuse a crown prince of murder.And yet, ""magicians"" have a right to their secrets, do they not? Eisenheim does his best to convince the crowds that his feats are simply illusions, tricks, magic. But the crowds are not convinced, and nor was i. That old man by the tree when Eisenheim was a child gave him something, an invisible yet tangible gift. How he uses that gift is the driving force of this film. It's an intriguing and interesting ride. Personally, i would run from this character's magic....Paul's character, the chief inspector Uhl, says to Eisenheim, not wanting to arrest him, ""you cant bring down the monarchy"". Somehow i don't believe Oliver Cromwell would have agreed with that; nor the Bolsheviks.... Eisenheim's final act on stage is something to behold. I found this film somewhat difficult, and it requires some emotional energy to watch. But it was worth the watch. It is a well-crafted film with a seamless sense of time and action. Very good, although, if you're feeling depressed, i'd save it for another time....even with the ""usual suspects"" kinda ""happy"" ending...."
"captbuckrogers25","10","5","9","11 September 2006"," A brilliant expression of cinematic synergy!!!
","Having always been passingly interested in magic and illusion, I was attracted to this movie from the very start. The list of actors involved served to further arouse my interest and the beautiful design displayed in the trailer was simply the icing on the already tempting cake. Then I saw the movie, and I have now seen all of my expectations proved utterly insufficient! The four main characters are portrayed with complete conviction by their respective players. Edward Norton plays a very cool and reserved Eisenheim. A temperament which seems a departure from some of the other roles I have seen him play. I will also jump on the bandwagon and say that I was happily surprised by the quality of performance by Jessica Biel. Her playing of Sophie was natural and involving. I hope to see more examples of this caliber from her in the future. And, of course and at the risk of being bland, the stunningly apt performances of Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell were treasures which would have been unexpected only by their absence.<br/><br/>I have heard complaints regarding the nearly insane attention to detail given to the production design, complaints which my personal aesthetic holds to be totally unfounded. The costume design is not only true to period, but also perfectly suited to both the characters and temper of the situation. The sets are powerfully dramatic in their own right, but used with such skill as to utilize that drama for the enhancement of mood without upstaging the players upon them. Likewise the score by Phillip Glass served to help steer the course of emotions in this film while also serving as a moderator to pace throughout the film. The lighting, filters, and de-focusing of the edges of the frame served to complete the nearly nostalgic experience.<br/><br/>As for the illusions themselves, while others picked at them and other details of the film its self, I was contented to simply be entertained and at times amazed by them. It is true that faults can be found in the construction of the film if one looks for them. But if you keep your eye on the film-makers hand, and let the film progress in its own way, then you may be tricked, but you will leave the theatre the more delighted for it!"

","""The Illusionist"" is a terrific film. It is no illusion to the audience to appreciate a work of art such as this. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, the Houdini of his time. He is convincing in the role, and very adept in captivating his actor audience as well as those in the cinema. His eyes are piercing. His gesticulations are perfection. Paul Giamatti stars as the Chief Inspector Uhl, who unravels the mystery with an energetic stance. Jessica Biel plays, Sophie, the lovely heroine responsible for the tricky plot. I prefer to allow the film going public to absorb the story on their rather than spoil any of its finely tuned twists. One cannot become the least bit bored because the attention is constantly on the slight of hand of the magical hero. Don't miss this movie. It is a real winner. And that is no illusion."

","We know what's coming with this and we even know how. At least I think most viewers will.<br/><br/>Its a con movie, but with more explicit folding. In the usual con genre, there is a mark who is fooled along with us the viewers. In this version, the con is literally a show on stage, a device that makes the con more folded: we watch a show (the movie) with a rapt audience (who we join and emulate) who watch the show that contains the con.<br/><br/>At the end, we are satisfied. <br/><br/>The con genre is something that spun out of noir, the unique invention of cinema, actually American cinema as a sort of innovation on the order of jazz in its place in music.<br/><br/>In noir, there are two worlds, one being the world of the folks we watch. These poor folks are visited by amazing coincidences and odd causal mechanics. There is a capricious fate that seems to bend the world  the actual way the world works  in order for there to be an engaging story.<br/><br/>The other world of course is the world of the fate, the gods and goddesses whose presence implicitly makes those bends. The world we watch is bent because we watch it. Twist and turns are there not because they make sense or reward the people they happen to, but to us. Into this world we slide, lubricated by our curious eye, teased a bit by exaggerated photography.<br/><br/>The con movie is also an American invention, I think, a child of noir. In this derivative, some of the characters become gods, sitting on our side, in our world. The other world remains haplessly manipulated. In the best of the con movie, it is doubly folded where we find at the end that we have been fooled ourselves, that we are in the watched world.<br/><br/>Now back to this. <br/><br/>Here come the spoilers.<br/><br/>If you watch it without paying attention, you will see a teen love affair. During a rendezvous they are interrupted and the girl beseeches her lover to ""make them disappear."" She is dragged away and he watches helplessly. <br/><br/>Then the story proper begins. We see him re-encounter his lost Sophie and through time rekindle the love, then plan an escape. That plan is an elaborate con, complete with a mark and a designated watcher to whom the con is revealed at the end. Happy happy are our couple and the gauzy ending leaves us with a smile.<br/><br/>But there's a strong suggestion that real magic is involved here. Real magic.<br/><br/>In an ordinary con movie, you go back through the events you see and re-register them. In fact, our designated viewer  a police chief  does this before our eyes. In a regular con movie, all these line up, they make sense in our new context.<br/><br/>But if you see this, you will see that they do not. There is a double con at work here. Our illusionist stages a version of the killing (in the mirror, on stage) before he is reacquainted with his love, just after he asks for a volunteer and she surprisingly is volunteered.<br/><br/>Hmm. If there was a con, it started here, or before here. Follow that thought back to the teens in peril and imagine what we see as a movie as the enclosing illusion of the movie. Then it makes sense that as the girl, they chose to make Biel up and light her to look uncannily like a young Cate Blanchett, playing a young Elizabeth to a young magical writer.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

While practicing some tricks on the streets, he meets the upper-class Sophie, they become friends and later they fall in love for each other. When they are separated by Sophie's family, the broken-hearted Eduard travels to the Far East and fifteen years later he returns to Vienna as a famous illusionist with a different name, Eisenheim (Edward Norton). While performing a show in the presence of the ambitious and ruthless Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the corrupt Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), Sophie (Jessica Biel) volunteers for a trick on the stage and they immediately recognize each other. The flame of their passion bursts, but Sophie is engaged of Leopold, as part of his political game to be crowned king with the support of Hungary in a coup d'état against his father. Sophie and Eisenheim plan to runaway together, but when the drunken Leopold discloses their intention, he apparently kills Sophie. The grieving Eisenheim brings his Chinese acquaintances and performs an amazing show, where nothing is what it seems.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" is a wonderful fable of love and illusion, one of the best movies I have recently seen. The original and excellent story is disclosed in an intelligent screenplay, magnificent cinematography and beautiful music score. The direction is stunning and the performances are fantastic, highlighting Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti in an upper level, immediately followed by Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel, who shows a great chemistry with Edward Norton. The twist is spectacular, and after watching this great movie, I realized how dirty the political game in the Oscar is, where nothing is what it seems, selecting ""The Departed"" as Best Movie just because of the name of Martin ""obsessed for Oscar"" Scosese. Honestly, there is no comparison between the boring, unrealistic and overrated ""The Departed"" and this overwhelming and mesmerizing ""The Illusionist"".

Instead it causes you to focus on reality itself and the computer generated graphics which make up the ENTIRE magic trick.<br/><br/>Maybe in the 1980's this movie would have moved an audience and evoked emotion.

"shattenjager777","4","4","7","14 January 2007"," Not particularly bad, but there just isn't much to it
","""The Illusionist"" looked like it had promise coming in. It had a loaded cast of not just stars but talented stars headed by Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton but even continuing on to Rufus Sewell. It had the second-best film composer alive, Philip Glass, writing the score. It sounded like it could be a fun tale of intrigue surrounding a stage magician. The only real worrisome part (admittedly a very large one) was screenwriter/director Neil Burger, who had only a faux documentary that didn't do well with critics or the public to his credit. Burger brought down the rest of the elements to make the film a middling mess.<br/><br/>The film's script is an issue because it pulls an unwanted sleight of hand, changing the film from a mystery a la ""The Prestige"" (which is how the commercials and trailer made it appear) into a very slight and trite period romance. Even the mystery element to the plot is loaded with thievery from earlier films, most notably from Carol Reed's ""The Third Man,"" which makes it far more predictable and thus less exciting than it seems it should be. The dialogue is also oblique and stilted. Even beyond these problems, the characterization is very poor, with no character ever really being fleshed out and no character showing ANY arc whatsoever.<br/><br/>That last script issue is the main problem with the acting, which is competent but in parts that require so little cannot be impressive. Some of the casting is also questionable, such as placing Jessica Biel in the position of the beautiful rich countess, but not bad enough to be truly damaging. Paul Giamatti's accent is also an issue, as it seems to fade in and out throughout the film.<br/><br/>Appropriately enough for a film that is so contrived and unoriginal, Philip Glass's score is loaded with retreads of his brilliant earlier work, most notably ""Powaqqatsi"" and ""The Hours."" It's still effective music, and none of it isn't at least reorchestrated, but for someone who knows Glass's earlier work it is a disappointment at least.<br/><br/>This leaves Burger's direction, which is uninspired. The film simply doesn't look any different from any other period romance of the same time, save perhaps for the embarrassingly silly effects during the performances. The editing is generally standard, slowing down for the more ""romantic"" moments and speeding up for the higher-tension moments. However, some of the decisions are so appalling that they make one question Burger's mental capacity. For example, the opening scene shows Giamatti speaking to Rufus Sewell about the results of the manhunt for Edward Norton--then later we see the manhunt. Though there is a twist involved here, one cannot be interested in the search when we've been told the result. The editing does its best to heighten the search's tension, but it can't overcome the basic issue.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Illusionist"" is maddening because of its lost potential, and the muddled final product isn't terrible. If you're interested in seeing a period romance with an above-average cast and a few special effects, this film is for you. Otherwise, the film isn't really worth the time and money."
"jennyhoek","10","4","7","14 September 2006"," GREAT movie
","Please understand, I usually like anything Edward Norton does, but this movie was really intriguing. Great twists, great acting by all of the cast, and a great story and plot. This movie got such little press I hadn't even heard of it when I went to see it, but it was very refreshing to see a movie I can't stop talking about (which is rare these days). Jessica Biel does an amazing job and Paul Giomatti's (sp?) acting only seems to get better and better lately. Ed Norton was amazing as well, but then again, when isn't he? I loved this movie so much I would go see it over and over again and to be honest, I didn't want to leave the theater when it was over. Tales about magic are always interesting. This was more than interesting!"
"rickmagic1","9","4","7","3 September 2006"," Wonderful story, good magic
","Understand that when I write this, I'm biased. I'm not only a professional magician, but my act is such that I perform as a Victorian-era magician. I've done tons of reading and research on the period, not to mention the type of magic that was performed, so that's really the direction that I'm coming from. That said, I'll start with the story. I felt that the story was interesting and compelling enough to keep my attention, though I did feel that it began to drag in the last hour. I liked the way that the director made you feel the transition with Eisenheim after the situation with Sophie. You could feel his mood change. I also felt that this was probably the best performance I've ever seen from Paul Giamatti. If he doesn't at least get a nomination for best supporting actor, I'll be sorely disappointed. His portrayal of the Chief Inspector that is torn between his admiration of Eisenheim and his loyalty to a corrupt monarch was simply brilliant! Now, I'll review it as a magician...it would have been nice to have seen the magic as it was actually performed in the Victorian era, but you can't win 'em all. The fact that they used Robert-Houdin's Orange Tree, then did it with ""movie magic"" instead of the way that Robert-Houdin did it in the 1850's was a bit disappointing...but didn't ruin the story for me. Great movie, highly recommended.<br/><br/>Rick"

I thought it was funny I was seeing a trailer for the movie I was about to see and then quickly realized they were too different movies. What a pleasant surprise! There is little violence, no inappropriate language and was not driven by sex scenes though one could call it a love story. The Illusionist was thoroughly entertaining. It had beautiful cinematography and excellent acting. It was engaging, and the ending was very satisfying. The Grand Illusion of the Illusionist is worth seeing. I would not have seen this movie if I didn't make the initial mistake. I hope others who would not have seen this movie will choose to. It's definitely worth seeing."
"Lazertron","1","19","54","18 September 2006"," Awful
","I watched this movie tonight and I have nothing but legitimate concern for the 70% of people who voted this movie better than an 8. It was awful. Absolutely terrible. Don't go see it, nothing is explained, its just ""uni""-faceted writing with absolutely no evident substance. Despite the incredible misuse of the iris shot this movie constantly uses to give it the feeling of a solid period piece, and the horrid camera usage and editing, what this movie lacks that never made up for those gross errors, is character development, feasible story line, historical relevance, and most of all a convincing script. Why is it in Vienna? Why do they all have crappy British accents? Why does none of the magic make sense? All legitimate questions that should be considered before this is voted a ""10"". There are scenes that are laughable solely because of the constant use of generic plot summary and convoluted dialog (""Oh I loved you and now we're finally together"" ""But do you really want to give up everything and be with me?"" ""Yes"" ""okay"") And worst of all none of it makes sense. It's not some sort of intelligent whodunit film where you're perpetually pondering what happened, it's a movie that is obvious in its exploits and drags through the development to get to the stupid point. If something didn't make sense or lacked cogency there was an allusion to the fact that Eisenhiem was simply a magician and thats what they do. I mean a machine that makes an orange plant that grows oranges? Transparent people that can look directly at others but do not exist in the public beyond the show? This movie seemed to flaunt it flaws simply because it was confident that the audience would somehow be subdued by the premise of a magician in a mystical period of time. And another thing missing: dialog. there are like 50 sentences outside narration in the entire movie. Thats called a crutch people and its what separates movies from bedtime stories. Boo this movie and the ignorant complacent people that somehow found it ""illusive"" and engaging. And if Eisenhiem really could do all that incredible stuff why didn't he create an illusion and kill the prince with one of his phantom children that have voices and talk and movement, that makes more sense than setting him up to kill himself after the poison in the drink he likes to frequent causes him to conveniently pass out outside the view of the one guard protecting the Prince of the biggest empire in Europe. This movie sucked major balls, and just because its the end of the summer and most of the movies are crap anyway this was one of the few I almost have walked out on in my life. Basic summary: Guy loves girl, guy isn't allowed to love girl, guy leaves gets powers that are never explained, guy comes back and gets girl, guy goes on tangent to screw over a petty one dimensional prick, guy gets away, all the while some police inspector that is blatantly established in modern law and ethics has a moral reformation for some reason. The Pretige is going to blow this movie out of the water and we'll all wonder what the hell movies like this and Magnolia are doing in the top thousand films on IMDb.,"
"spaektor","5","6","13","24 August 2006"," not nearly as good as i'd hoped
","As movies go, it's better than average. The look and feel of the film do an excellent job of transporting the viewer to early 20th century Vienna. The acting is pretty good from all members of the cast. But about halfway through the film, the charm starts to fade, the plot becomes apparent, and the pacing slows to a deathly crawl.<br/><br/>The production value is great. At no point in the film did I feel I wasn't in Vienna in the early 1900s. The color palate of much of the film is a few shades shy of sepia, coupled with soft lighting that, to me, felt a lot like ""Somewhere In Time."" But it's never overdone.<br/><br/>The acting was good. Norton's accent seemed to fade in and out at times. Giamatti, as always, delivers. Biel surprised me; her accent was consistent and her performance sincere. Though their individual performances were good, there was zero chemistry between Biel and Norton; part of it was the script. For cryin' out loud, how romantic is it that she doesn't recognize him when they're reunited?! Anyway. Sewell plays his role of pompous villain to perfection, but that is no surprise at all; he has great presence and talent. I would just like him to get more roles as a protagonist.<br/><br/>The plot and pace are what killed the movie for me. In the first half it's fine, and necessary to really develop your characters and get the audience to invest in them. But by the time the murder occurs, the pacing hasn't changed at all. We KNOW Giamatti, though ordered to shut Norton down, is a good guy that wants to do the right thing; we KNOW that Norton is talented and ballsy; we KNOW that they are in love; but at the point the film should kick things up a notch. Instead, the audience is treated to a full forty-five minutes of an excruciatingly slow re-hashing of these character and plot points.<br/><br/>The plot itself was pretty transparent. When the camera VERY suddenly switches its POV from Biel's and Sewell's characters to some random butler's line of sight just before the murder, which is never actually shown, it's waaaaaaaaaayyy too obvious that some elaborate plan is in effect. Once you realize that, the rest of the film becomes a potpourri of transparencies. The doctor appears and disappears too suddenly for him to not be a cohort of some kind, reinforced by his insistence that Giamatti leave the body alone; the doctor handily produces a gem that could only be from the prince's jewel-encrusted sword; Biel's body is found in the river, and I'm sorry, but there's no way she could be dead, or Norton's character would be the biggest schmuck ever. I just couldn't buy the second half. And I really hate being the Monday morning QB, but I even saw the ending coming, a la ""Usual Suspects."" Except the final montage of realization here was a series of disjointed images intercut with Giamatti's visage contorting into some goofy grin. Part of why it didn't work is that many of those ""ooooohh, THAT's what he was talking about"" moments were taken from private exchanges between Norton and Biel, that Giamatti wouldn't be privy to. And, lastly, if Giamatti were to take another moment, he'd realize that Norton completely used him and basically framed an innocent man, while causing him to commit suicide. Granted, that man is an arrogant, power-hungry and abusive jerk, but ultimately he is innocent. Would the good guys kill for true love? What would Wesley and Buttercup say?"

","It was easy to see exactly what the ""surprise"" ending would be an hour before it reared its tedious head. After all, didn't he ask her if she wanted to come with him just before the shenanigans began? And wasn't he an ""illusionist""?<br/><br/>There was a major Hollywood fallacy that made the movie into a typical puerile Hollywood commodity. When a powerful prince, who could be beyond the law, asks his ambitious chief inspector to get rid of someone, that someone would disappear, quickly; not have endless, idiotic discussions with a namby-pamby, highly moral and indecisive chief inspector who behaved more like Captain Kangaroo rather than the ruthless, blindly-obedient servant of the prince required of the position. Did the illusionist use his high-pitched, insipid voice to hypnotize the chief inspector? Perhaps. But it would not have saved the chief inspector from the lethal wrath of the prince.<br/><br/>And that last scene. All I could think of is, ""Where is that raised-in-luxury noblewoman going to do shopping?"" No need for that when you've got dried elk patties to gather for the stove."

"Leofwine_draca","5","3","5","1 November 2011"," Elaborate shaggy dog story
","I watched THE ILLUSIONIST for the magic, I'll make no bones about that. The added romance and political intrigue where neither here nor there. The whole draw of the film is watching a magician carry out spectacular trick after spectacular trick, and admittedly the special effects used to achieve these ends are great. But, as the movie progresses and we move no closer to finding out the reality behind the magic, I realised I was watching an elaborate shaggy dog story.<br/><br/>THE PRESTIGE, a rival film dealing with 19th century magic that came out at the same time, annoyed me because it resorted to some ludicrous science fiction premise to explain the magic at work. I felt cheated. THE ILLUSIONIST doesn't even do that – there's no explanation or big reveal, which is a cheat in itself as you're left wondering. Instead, this is one of those films where it's all about the plot twists, which is fine when the twists work and make more sense on a second watch (THE SIXTH SENSE and THE USUAL SUSPECTS being perfect examples). The twists in THE ILLUSIONIST rely on suspension of disbelief because they're frankly unbelievable, and at that stage the film lost me.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because there's a lot of good stuff on offer here. The sets and costumes are sumptuous, as is the period atmosphere. The supporting cast is excellent, although Edward Norton's mysterious Eisenheim is never more than a one-dimensional figure and Jessica Biel never more than the damsel in distress. Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell make up for it, with their customary great acting and nuanced, mannered turns as detective and prince respectively. It's just a shame the script decided to veer into contrivance and 'clever clever' make believe instead of developing a truly original story."
"diac228","10","3","5","5 March 2007"," A rare, but excellent movie-going treat
","The popularity of the average magician is fading away into obscurity. No longer are they amongst the most popular celebrities out there like in the much older days centuries ago. A good magician film is even harder to find. With technology progressing the way it does nowadays, it is even harder to craft a good magician film without it being overblown or revealed with special effects. The Illusionist however, is a diamond in the rough, a rare exception in which when special effects is required, it delivers, but in such small doses that the magic comes off as almost believable. To add to the stunning visual effects is a magnificent score, an emotional love story, a murder mystery, suspense, drama, great writing, decent directing, and magnificent cinematography. Emerging almost out of nowhere back in 2006, it has become a surprise hit and with good reason too.<br/><br/>The Illusionist follows the life of a controversial magician by the name of Eisenheim (Edward Norton) that has a very unique and special gift that allows for him to do things that other people only dream about being able to do. But, despite his talents, his position in the social circle of Europe prevents him from getting a certain amount of respect. What's worse is that his love (Jessica Biel) just happens to be higher up in the social ladder, and it would be almost impossible for them to be together. Using his talents, his wits, and persistence, he tries to win his dream girl Sophie and stay away from the troubles of a corrupt inspector (Paul Giamatti) and the crown prince (Rufus Sewell).<br/><br/>What else is there to say about this film? Its woven together beautifully and presented magnificently. We'll start by praising the acting. Edward Norton, whose previous work has proved his ability as a superb actor (Especially Fight Club), shines yet again as the main character. You can almost feel his sorrow, his despair when he is at his emotional low points. Jessica Biel, despite her start at a mediocre family dramedy, does a swell job as Eisenheim's love interest. Mixing her natural beauty with vulnerability in her eyes Biel is impressive as a woman stuck in a world she obviously doesn't belong in. Surpassing them both is Paul Giamatti, whose work has quite a range (Big Fat Liar, Big Momma's House, Sideways), yet nails it home portraying the calm yet rather lost Inspector Uhl.<br/><br/>Continuing on the praise express, the next stop is congratulating the writer for lacing a great screenplay out of a relatively unknown short story. Full of details, plot twists, mysteries, and tense moments, you as the audience are left mesmerized and unaware of what is about to happen next. Taking advantage of a fine script, the director (Neil Burger, who happens to be the writer as well) and cinematographer (Dick Pope) capture all the majesty and mastery of our main character and the unsolved questions of the conflicts by displaying beautiful scenery, a knack for tone, and the ability to drop off little clues and fine points as the movie charges along from one scene to the next. Also helping progress The Illusionist is the original score of Philip Glass, which stands as one of the best composers in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>The third act is where everything falls into play and the true abilities of everyone involved is revealed. In the third act, we see the best in directing, music, acting, and writing, as the ending comes almost out of nowhere but comes off as so refreshing, you cannot help but have a smile on your face as the credits roll. Unlike most films, the final moments of the movie rewards the audience by revealing the tricks that not only the magician but also the director had pulled right in front of your eyes. The Illusionist serves as a piece of work that is a magic trick: there is the teaser, the scenario, and then before you know it, the magic.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A nice movie that exceeded expectations and stunned critics and audiences alike, The Illusionist serves as a unique movie going experience that is quite captivating and entertaining to watch. With a hint of mystery with romance, drama, suspense, and themes of love, fate, and life against death, this serves as one of 2006's biggest and most underrated surprises. Firing on all cylinders and hitting the mark quality-wise in all aspects of film-making, it's really hard to find something wrong with this picture. Morality issues may be sparking once the film is done, but in terms of technical issues and directing techniques, there's very, very little to complain about here. Highly recommend, hopefully we'll see more of Neil Burger in the near future."

","I was so eager to watch the film when it came out, mainly because of Edward Norton, but sadly, it turned out to be really disappointing.<br/><br/>As usual, Edward Norton gave a fabulous performance but that's the most credit i could give to this film. Jessica Biel's character was just so plain, with no substance to it. Paul Giamatti did a good job as a police inspector who's downright annoying, but it was hard to see what his character's intentions were. Rufus Sewell, as the Crown Prince, failed to bring the evil-ness or mean-ness out of his character. It seems that the director has no idea whether to make him seem evil or pathetic. The cast was beautiful but the characters' development in the film was so little that they leave no deep impressions.<br/><br/>The development of the plot was just so slow and sometimes it was hard to see where the director was going with the plot. The magic tricks/illusions done were uninteresting and somehow to me, the whole illusion of the dead made no sense or meaning to the film or story.<br/><br/>I hated the ending of the film. It was just so lazily done, with all the flashback montages to explain the whole film. A great twist, no doubt, but the director did no justice to the twist at all."

"DICK STEEL","8","3","5","12 January 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Illusionist
","Director Neil Burger is a relative unknown. To date he has only directed one other feature film, Interview With An Assassin, a fictional account of the real shooter of the JFK assassination, which I had the chance of watching it on DVD some time back. Comparing production values, it's a great leap forward for Burger, having now directed a movie starring heavyweight character actors Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>Adapted from a short story by writer Steven Millhauser called Eisenheim the Illusionist, this movie made its debut at last year's Sundance Film Festival, and was supposed to have premiered locally at around the same time as Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. However, I suspect that distributors might have thought the pairing of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, excellent actors in their own right, would find it tough against competition in Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, who in today's context, are instantly recognizable and appealing because of their successful comic book movie roles in Batman and X-Men respectively.<br/><br/>In reality, comparing The Illusionist to The Prestige is comparing apples to oranges. The only similarities they share are their occupation - practitioners of magic, and coupled with immense knowledge of science and technology. Although period movies, they share similar eras, but are based in separate locations - this one in Vienna, the other in London. At its core, The Prestige is one solid movie about obsession and revenge, but The Illusionist is surprisingly, for all its moodiness displayed in the trailer, it's all about love.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is Eisenheim, top illusionist whom some say he dabbles in the dark arts and sold his soul to the devil. Watching what he could do, you'll probably be more inclined to agree. After having lost his love due to a difference in class, he meets up with Sophie (Jessica Biel) again, although this time she's about to get engaged to Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Hence the dilemma, and now, an opportunity to try and get his girl.<br/><br/>It's a beautifully filmed movie, and I marvel at the cinematography and techniques to date this movie to the early silent movie era. The production values are top notch, with costumes, makeup and special effects which, though simple, deserve special mention as they just worked brilliantly to enhance the viewing experience. The magic here is ""magic"" in that sense of the word, and doesn't try to obsess itself with trying to explain the plausibility behind every trick. And yes, there are more magic here, if that's your cup of tea (though of course, aided by cinematic movie making tricks).<br/><br/>But what I thought really did the trick (pardon the pun), was Paul Giamatti's character Chief Inspector Uhl, as the man caught in the middle of a moral dilemma. Through his eyes, we see the corruption of those in power, and when put in a position where you are reliant on that power, how it could serve to confuse, whether to betray your values for material wealth and status, or to do what is right. Edward Norton is not as muted here as his other movie also now showing in Singapore - The Painted Veil, and although his Eisenheim is strictly focused on his goals, his intense fixation somehow diluted the complexity of his character somewhat. Jessica Biel unfortunately is the weak link here, as is Rufus Sewell as he struggles through his yet-another-villain role which doesn't offer much range besides snarling and being nasty.<br/><br/>Before you pass judgement during the movie's plot development as being too simplistic if compared to The Prestige's, I'd say to hold that thought, and to pay close attention. It's a mixture of drama, mystery and romance, and when all's revealed at the end, somehow it'll just bring a smile to your face, especially so if you're a romantic.<br/><br/>I like The Illusionist!"
"kezop_male","10","3","5","11 January 2007"," A taut, romantic drama
","Edward Norton as the illusionist ""Eisenheim"" gives us a delightful  hero. To our modern day eye, it is easy to slip and think of his  appearance as a cliché, but it is completely in keeping with the  fashions of the time period for both men of Europe and, in particular,  magicians. Full evening attire was the norm for a stage magician.  Two elements were particularly fun for this former professional  magician and history buff. First and foremost, the fine line that magic  walked during the 19th and early 20th century (and before, technically,  but trust me, it came to head with the scientific advances and  discoveries of the late 1800's). During that time period, magicians  were simply fooling audiences in much the same ways as they are today,  yet the general population was much closer to the old beliefs and  superstitions. Magic was an affront to science, though ironically, in  its actual workings, it was more a celebration of science. Secondly, an  element that is the focal point of the movie ""The Prestige,"" and that  is, the close guarding of secrets.  While not all of the illusions presented are as faithful to real life  as ""The Prestige,"" it's close enough that it works. I saw nothing  presented that could not be roughly duplicated (or actually was done)  at the time.  The ending is, well, truly satisfying. Sit down with your spouse, grab  the popcorn, get past the rather odd beginning (which sets the pace and  tone of the movie very well), and get ready for a GREAT movie."

","Of being a Ed Norton fan I was very excited about seeing this movie even though I had to travel 45 minutes away to see it. I was expecting a great movie but I never though the whole theater was going to applaud at the end. This movie was that good. Paul Giamatti also did an excellent job as he too is one of my favorites. Jessica Beil even was great and before she was one of the reasons for me to not see the movie.<br/><br/>The movie started off with credits that worked very well with dissolves that were beautifully done and gave the movie a great start. Than it showed Ed Norton in a chair, just chilling there. Then he gets arrested. But why does he get arrested? The directer doesn't tell you right off the bat.<br/><br/>The movie also describes the illusionist's childhood with a great flashback of how he met his first love and why she was taken away from him. It also describes why he became a magician.<br/><br/>The magic / illusions that was performed in this movie was very well done and I'm trying to figure out how the did them from the great camera work that was credited to the film. Understanding that Neil Buger hasn't had much of a resume in the past really surprised me and I know there will be a lot more work for him in the future.<br/><br/>This film can be scene by mature children from a brief sex scene (no nudity). The best thing I can tell you about this movie is that there is a twist at the end, and it should make you smile. Perhaps not a Primal Fear twist but enough to keep you talking for the ride home."

Jessica looks fantastic (her part doesn't need or get too much of an acting performance).<br/><br/>However... the story was amazingly predictable -- at least to me.

","The Illusionist presents the story of a magician's love affair with a duchess that has been promised to a crown prince in turn-of-the-century Vienna. The cast includes Edward Norton (Fight Club, Red Dragon) as title character Eisenheim, Jessica Biel (7th Heaven, Summer Catch) as love interest Sophie, Rufus Sewell (A Kight's Tale, Tristan & Isolde) as prince Leopold and Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Cinderella Man) as the city's chief investigator.<br/><br/>In general, movies ask their audience to suspend belief for the short hours they spend in the viewer's chair. For the most part, when a movie is well made, it does not matter what the content as long as it is able to draw its audience into the world it has created and keep them there for the duration of the story. In this movie there is one major flaw: it cannot hold its audience captive. The words that the actors say, the clothes they wear, even the places they go all seem right but they fail in that one particular way. They fail to be real.<br/><br/>Sadly, the female lead, and virtually only female character, is the worst of it all. Biel's acting comes across as mechanical and lacking true emotions. Maybe it is because she and Norton have no chemistry, or maybe it is because she should stick to fun but flimsy teen movie roles. Also, though it is quite obvious that both Norton and Giamatti are confident in their acting chops, and rightly so, it is hard to take either one too seriously when they are given such clichéd moments to portray. Even Sewell, usually the excellent bad guy, becomes slightly ridiculous toward the end when he rages over his crumbling world.<br/><br/>The idea for this film is ingenious. A sort of displaced Romeo and Juliet, almost the love story of Titanic but with a little magic thrown in could have been a brilliant hit had it been properly executed. Unfortunately, despite the lavish costumes and dreamy camera work, nothing could keep this movie from being just not good."

","When I heard that there'd be two ""turn of the century magician"" movies coming out this year, I was expecting the classic ""Armageddon/Deep Impact"" Law of Hollywood; wherein some scribe came up with a cute idea and a rival studio's mole funneled it back, causing a race to pump out 2 cruddy movies in record time.<br/><br/>My thoughts were waylaid, though, when I heard that this was based on an award winning short story (!)starring Edward Norton (!) Paul Giamatti (!) and featuring the supporting cast of Jessica Biel's lips(!!). Unfortunately, and perhaps unfairly since everyone is already gaging it against the trailer for ""The Prestige"", the result underwhelms. Not that it's not a completely capable film; Herr Direktor uses flickering film effects and irising reminiscent of silent films, Ed Norton is predictably solid, Giamatti chews scenery like succulent beef jerky, the googly-eyed mean guy from ""A Night's Tale"" is both googly and mean, and Biel's lips are... quite present.<br/><br/>However the film itself is simplistic; the magic effects are mere CGI add-ins rather than slight of hand, and the plot is a bit to easy to unravel by the half-way point. In fact, the main plot is little more than a classic Holmesian mystery that could have been told quite cleanly in 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is unfair to instantly judge a piece by the sum of its accomplished and well-paid parts, but as such, ""The Illusionist"" merely passes the grade of standard entertainment... Though the costume designer should be commended; the low slung cowl on Biel's on-stage cloak hangs to her nose, giving the audience every opportunity to enjoy her, um, y'know acting."

","Two-dimensional characters can be fun in a pantomime or melodrama, such as the infallible wizard Eisenheim (Norton), the adorable-in-spite-of-being-a-duchess Sophie (Biel), and the black-hearted Crown Prince (Sewell). The only character in The Illusionist who undergoes any sort of development is the police inspector, who starts as the evil prince's lickspittle and ends as Eisenheim's greatest admirer. This isn't enough - or it's too much if all you want is pantomime.<br/><br/>If the actual story were stronger, the fact that The Illusionist is only a bare melodrama wouldn't matter; it's beautifully staged, and the actual premise of the cabinet-maker's son and the ultra-posh duchess separated as teenage lovers promises a solid, if corny, ending.<br/><br/>But the script fails to deliver *SPOILER*. <br/><br/>At the end, the way in which Eisenheim has managed to fake Sophie's death is all explained in a multi-flashback in the police inspector's head, because both hero and heroine have left the stage about fifteen minutes previously. This is actually a clunky Deus Ex ending, not the twist which it pretends to be, and it doesn't resolve the story properly. It seems that Eisenheim was an expert chemist, as well as a virtuoso hypnotist, engineer, and all-round decent cove.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie to share with your kids at Christmas maybe, and still better than the ridiculous Prestige because it's unpretentious."

","Based on the short story by Steven Milhauser, ""Eisenheim The Illusionist"" set in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in the 19th century tells the tale about the son of a working-class carpenter who specializes in cabinets falls smitten for an upper-class Viennese lady but is not permitted to go anywhere near her due to the discrimination torn between their social standings. The story leads the young man to a professional magician who reveals his crafty illusions as he explores mystifying lands that further enhances his knowledge towards the mysteries of life. Upon his return to Vienna, where the now confident commoner begins to perform his magic act, not just towards the plebeian spectators, but also towards the upper echelons of social class including his majesty the crowned Prince Rudolf, the son of Emperor Franz Josef who ruled the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.<br/><br/>The original premise of the story was intended to have been an exploitation aimed towards the monarchy, in which a gruesome incident happened where at a hunting lodge, the bodies of Prince Rudolf and his girlfriend the Baroness Mary Vetsera were found and the scandal was handled in low prolific matter for a number of years by the Royal family as a ploy to save their reputation.<br/><br/>Edward Norton was excellent as the titular character and what's the real treat about Norton's performance is that many of the magic were actually performed the talented thespian. It must've taken him an overwhelming amount of time before he was able to perfect his magical skills. When the credits rolled, it had I wondering if these acts of trickery were just optical illusions or did Eisenheim possessed something more mystical than one could imagine.<br/><br/>The effects were just as equally magical as the tricks Eisenheim was performing. One of the best tricks in the movie unquestionably would have to be the Excalibur Sword trick where the talented magician takes Rudolf's sword and the sword is pointed erect and is somehow magnetically attached to the stage. Eisenheim asks the patricians to release the sword from the stage, unfortunately to no avail, they failed to do so (an unfortunate homage to the King Arthur story). However, Prince Rudolf manages pull the sword from its position even through a flawed effort, which causes a bit of humiliation on the part of the Prince who now declares Eisenheim an enemy amongst the aristocracy.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti does another incredible performance as the untrustworthy Inspector Uhl. Giamatti is such an incredibly talented performer, able to play unique and versatile roles in comedy, tragedy, drama and thrillers.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was very original and blends in beautifully with the time period. It felt like the audience was living in that time period. It gave me the impression that the director Neil Burger used editing techniques that were dated over 80 years ago which is a bit unorthodox for such a film that is strong in fantasy, brilliant in supernatural effects and a romance story equally effective as any Shakespeare story. The ending of the story was executed to near perfection which exemplifies that excellent storytelling is played from the heart. This is a tale not to miss."

","""The Illusionist"" is a period drama set in Vienna around the turn-of-the-20th-century.The ""illusionist"" of the title is Eisenheim, a celebrated stage magician, and the story tells of his love for the aristocratic Sophie von Teschen. Eisenheim (whose real name is Eduard Abramovich) and Sophie were teenage sweethearts, but because of the difference in social class (he is the son of a cabinetmaker) their love was a hopeless one and her family forbade her to see him. When they meet again, Sophie is the reluctant fiancée of Crown Prince Leopold, the son of the Emperor Franz Josef and a drunken debauchee with a history of violence against women. (He is rumoured to have murdered a former mistress). To make matters worse, Leopold is planning a coup d'état to usurp the Imperial Crown from his father. Eisenheim has to call on all his skills as a magician to thwart Leopold's plans and to save Sophie from the prospect of a marriage which is hateful to her.<br/><br/>Leopold is, of course, a fictitious character. Franz Josef only had one son, Crown Prince Rudolf, who died in a suicide pact with his mistress in 1889. At the time the film is set the heir to the Habsburg throne was Rudolf's cousin, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Leopold, however, does bear some resemblance in character to the notoriously dissolute Rudolf (although not to the historical Franz Ferdinand, who was a devoted family man). Sophie is another fictitious character, although there was indeed a von Teschen family, a younger branch of the Habsburg dynasty, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<br/><br/>Edward Norton can normally be relied upon to deliver a good performance, and does not disappoint here. His Eisenheim is, as befits a man whose trade is based upon mystery and illusion, suitably inscrutable and enigmatic, but behind his outwardly calm demeanour we can discern a powerful sense of right and wrong and a deep love for Sophie (Jessica Biel, looking as stunning as ever). Another important character is Paul Giamatti's Chief Inspector Uhl, the detective ordered by Leopold to spy on Sophie and Eisenheim. Uhl is a man of divided loyalties. On the one hand he is a patriot and a loyal servant of his emperor; on the other his own strong sense of morality leads him to despise Leopold and to sympathise with the young lovers.<br/><br/>The film has an unusual look. Although it is officially a colour film, it is characterised by dull tones and a lack of bright colours. The aim seems to have been to produce something reminiscent of a sepia photograph, appropriate to the period during which it is set. Overall this is an intelligent, well-written, well-acted and enjoyable historical romance-drama. 7/10"

","I'm trying something different with this one: writing my impressions of this film whilst watching it on DVD for the first time. You know, I figured out the ""surprise"" of the Sixth Sense about 10 minutes into the film. With this one, the plot twist was a complete surprise right up until the end of the film. In the final summation, the magician is the director, and the audience being sold the illusion is the one in the movie theatre.<br/><br/>The writing drips with meaning with every phrase and glance and gesture. But, is information, or disinformation? Edward Norton, like Russel Crowe, knows how to read a script and work with a director. Norton is a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for a good time at the movies, even though, in this one, his acting ain't that great, particularly the accent. But it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>It is Paul Giamatti who actually anchors the film. He represents the audience, and is the most rounded character in this piece. Like so many of us today, he is a moral man, trapped in a corporatist institution that uses his talents and corrupts his soul. But is that soul beyond redemption? Are ours? This film deals with multiple themes: love, morals, objections to rash power, use and abuse of power. This film is a compelling portrayal of totalitarianism and a police state's attempts to control and silence the truth.<br/><br/>I can quibble: Vienna depicted as way too clean for a turn-of-the-20th Century period piece, where the primary means of heating in bad weather was coal, but I imagine that this was deliberate to the production design and the mood that was trying to be created. The DP, production designer and director are able to use a very interesting use of colour, even if it is too clean! Lastly, the music is majestic and evocative of the European music of the past.<br/><br/>A wonderful film."

","It is not easy to bring magic into a movie. It takes more than imagination, more than atmosphere, more than excellent acting performances. Maybe it takes all of them combined, plus a little something that has to do with the plot. And the ""illusionist"" has all of the above. It is a film worthy of its title and reputation, with Norton giving -once more- a great performance, even though none of the other actors is any less. Romance, mystery, magic, all at the exact right proportion, providing a unique power. It is, after all, a matter of how much a director can leave you with this feeling of ""It was such a great journey"" that matters. That he has taken you somewhere you really found worthy being at. It is in any case important to comment on Norton' s contribution to this outstanding result. Playing a man with the ability of deception is not an easy task. It might be relatively easy to do it in front of a live audience, but when on screen, the audience needs quite more to follow an illusionist. And Norton manages to have this look of ""I can do anything"", which seems to come from a deep knowledge and acceptance of this fact. He does not give the sense of a performer, but of someone able to twist the natural world around. It is, no doubt, his physical characteristics, as well as his amazing ability to dive into each characters deeper self. I would assume the writer of the story was exceptionally lucky and blessed in this movie, and his story did not lose its strength, as so many stories have in movies unable to provide the atmosphere or character strength the writer had in mind."

","The Illusionist is one of my favorite movies of all time, because of the fact that it keeps you thinking and interested throughout the whole thing. Set in late nineteenth century Vienna, The Illusionist it one of those movies with AHA! moments and a mysteriousness that keeps you trying to figure out what's going to happen next. This quote from Herr Eisenheim's assistants summarizes the air of mystery: ""Life and death. Space and time. Fate and chance. These are the forces of the universe. Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a man who has unlocked these mysteries. From the furthest corners of the world where the dark arts still hold sway he returns to us to demonstrate laws may be bent. I give you Eisenheim."" This is a quote makes you look at what Eisenheim's doing, make you believe that he is really doing it, but makes you think of HOW he is doing it, makes you QUESTION the abilities of a person and their will. Herr Eisenheim, played by Edward Norton (The Italian Job, Kingdom of Heaven) plays a magician, or more as the title entails, an illusionist. An illusionist is, by definition, one who uses techniques such as foreshortening to produce the illusion of reality especially in visual art. Herr Eisenheim used his skills to attract the attention of a young Duchess named Sophie, played by Jessica Biel (7th Heaven, Stealth, Summer Catch) who is forbidden to see him. After years apart, they meet again, when Crown Prince Leopold, who is played by Rufus Sewell (Tristan + Isolde, The Holiday, A Knight's Tale) comes with his fiancé, who just happens to be Sophie, to one of Eisenheim's shows, and when Eisenheim asks for a volunteer, the Crown Prince stands and volunteers her. Throughout the rest of the movie, it seems that Eisenheim and Sophie are having a fling, which they are and aren't at the same time. The Crown Prince has Chief Inspector Uhl, played by Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Cinderella Man, Fred Claus), follow them around, keeping an eye on them at all times. What looks as if a sure fire way to get caught, Eisenheim uses his wits, tricks, and thoughtfulness into getting around what everybody sees. What he is planning, from nearly the beginning, isn't what everyone believes it to be. ""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion,"" a quote by Eisenheim, understood to be said for his performance, is much more than that. <br/><br/>This movie could have ruined by the ending alone, but the way that Neil Burger does it is so fluid that it makes it even better than expected. The way that Edward Norton played his part was mesmerizing, you couldn't help but think of what he was planning to do and how he was going to do it. He played his part perfectly, being that during his performances he used a monotonous voice, ultimately using whatever voice needed (sad, excited, or spontaneous). Jessica Biel played her part good as well. It surprised me, because the only shows I've ever seen her on are either adventures or comedies, but this was the first time I've seen here in a drama. She did extremely well, in my opinion, and from what I've read, so do other movie-goers who've seen this film. Giamatti played it well too, as I expected, as he played his role in Cinderella Man very well. Burger made the magic tricks convincing. They're very believable, and they're interesting and really cool. The first time I saw this, I was expecting yet another one of those ""predictable"" movies, but the way it is set up is exactly as the tagline says: ""Nothing is what it seems."" It's so captivating, as many times as I've seen it, I still marvel at the way it keeps my attention. I watch lots of movies, and there really aren't many that do that. It's amazing how close this movie is to perfection. You MUST see it!!"

Browns, sepias and ochres suffuse the screen, seducing us into a world of chimaeras and fairy-tale reality masterminded by quiet and unassuming Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton).<br/><br/>This is a romantic mystery around a brilliant stage magician of yesteryear, determined to win back his childhood sweetheart from a corrupt and dangerous Prince. Through flashback, we see Sophie, a child of the gentry. Eisenheim, on the other hand, is a lowly son of a cabinet-maker. Where The Prestige toyed with magicians seeking ultimate magic through fringe science of the day, The Illusionist has an air of fantasy where amazing powers are never questioned. The main protagonists have a Hansel-and-Gretel innocence against a big bad tyrant.<br/><br/>Says director Neil Burger, ""Most of the tricks are based on real illusions,"" but, even though based on tricks of the period, they are rather stunning on screen, due in no small part to the very powerful, almost hypnotic presence exerted by Edward Norton. But at one point early on, it seemed to be getting a bit too Harry Potter. Burger says, ""If you're going to exaggerate certain elements, to have it be dreamlike or surreal or uncanny, you have to make sure that the rest of it has a rock solid foundation in the period."" The film is so smoothly delivered that it seems pointless worrying about how exaggerated they were. ""My goal was to have the film completely inhabit that realm of dream and mystery,"" he says, and succeeds.<br/><br/>Jessica Biel, as Sophie, also gives a strong melt-in-the-mouth performance. Paul Giamatti, as the doggedly persevering police chief, torn between conscience and following crooked orders, shows a strength in his performance that contrasts well with bumbling characters of earlier films (such as Sideways). Norton is tender and caring - again a revelation testifying to a breadth of very considerable acting skills. <br/><br/>The film competed against The Prestige for Best Cinematography Oscar, and has a very distinctive look, based on an early colour photography process called 'autochrome'. Philip Glass, one of the most important contemporary composers and well respected for his film scores, seamlessly maintained the flow of the movie (even if it did sound disturbingly similar to his score for The Hours). But the consummate production values and perfectly combined talent going into The Illusionist is also its weakest point. Where The Prestige hit an unsettling nerve by keeping the audience unsure of the plot development, The Illusionist, appealing to a wider market, is engaging but controlled. The surprise ending is icing on the cake of a sumptuously professional piece of entertainment. Elegant and mesmerising, skilfully saturated with stylish energy, a tale of forbidden love that will delight as an intelligent date movie or as family entertainment. Production line it might be, but top of the range. Or so we are meant to believe."

","The Illusionist is one of those movies which not only demands a second viewing but demands a second viewing immediately after the first viewing has concluded. As soon as the closing credits begin to roll you'll want to go back and watch it again right that very minute to unravel this film's mysteries. What is illusion and what is real? The joy in this film is in finding the answer to that question.<br/><br/>Set in Austria in the early 1900s The Illusionist has all the terrific visuals and costumes you would expect of a period piece. It also has terrific acting performances, most notably from Edward Norton as the title character, Eisenheim the Illusionist. Jessica Biel, after appearing in a string of altogether forgettable films in which she was required to do nothing more than look pretty, makes a bid to be taken seriously as an actress and absolutely succeeds. Rufus Sewell, who makes for a great villain, and the always reliable Paul Giamatti round out the key figures in the terrific cast. There is also a wonderful score by Philip Glass which sets just the right mood throughout. But for all the great visuals and acting and music what makes this film great is its story.<br/><br/>The central figure here is Norton's Eisenheim who puts on a highly popular magic show in Vienna. One night Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, attends Eisenheim's show and here things get very interesting. Considering himself to be quite the intellectual, Leopold will be exceedingly frustrated by his inability to expose what he feels must surely be sheer fakery by Eisenheim. He will soon be even more frustrated when it becomes apparent the woman he intends to marry, Duchess Sophie, as played by Biel, would much rather be with Eisenheim than with him. It turns out Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood friends and now they clearly wish to reconnect. But the Crown Prince stands in the way. When Eisenheim takes the opportunity to embarrass Leopold in front of the elite of Austrian society Leopold takes it upon himself to make things rather difficult for the illusionist. Leopold can, and does, threaten Eisenheim's career but that is of little concern to Eisenheim. He simply wants the girl. Suffice to say Leopold can make things rather difficult for Eisenheim in that regard as well.<br/><br/>There are plenty of twists and turns along the way but it is hard to see how Eisenheim and Sophie, these ill-fated lovers, can ever be together. Leopold simply will not allow it and you do not argue with the heir to the throne. With the aid of Police Inspector Uhl, played by Giammati, whose position requires him to serve the Crown Prince's every whim, Leopold is determined to keep Eisenheim and Sophie apart and, just for good measure, expose the illusionist as a fraud as well. It is obvious that while Leopold is utterly dismissive, Inspector Uhl has a healthy respect for Eisenheim and his abilities. Just what is Eisenheim capable of? As the movie progresses Eisenheim changes his act and begins to perform an entirely different kind of illusion. No rabbit out of a hat stuff here. These illusions are utterly shocking and serve to incite Leopold more than ever which it seems can only lead to Eisenheim's arrest. What exactly is Eisenheim up to? Why would he put himself in such a position? It all comes back to the simple question...what is illusion and what is real? In the end, all is revealed. Well not all, because that wouldn't be very magical. But we learn enough to appreciate the brilliance of Eisenheim. And we also can't help but appreciate the brilliance of this movie's story and the exceedingly clever way in which it unfolds. It's a fascinating, thought-provoking story and it is performed wonderfully by a terrific cast. Watch it once and you'll want to watch it again and again."

","I was completely and utterly captivated by watching The Illusionist. The storyline is very clever and beautifully written. Edward Norton did a phenomenal job, which was no surprise since he is amazing in every movie I have seen him in. I am very impressed with Jessica Biel. She was amazing. And of course Paul Giamatti was great as always.<br/><br/>At first I did not think Biel and Norton would have chemistry, but really did. You, as the viewer, could feel the passion that these two characters had for each other. I was almost speechless.<br/><br/>The Illusionist is one of the best films I have seen all year. It is absolutely beautiful and I would DEFINITELY recommend people to watch it. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!"

","This film seems to pile comments on both sides of the teeter-totter. Some are negative and some (like me) seem to like the total package of The Illusionist. Negative comments appear to focus on specifics - Why this or that for location. I hate one actor or another's performance. Yawn factor to wow factor. What are you to believe? My best guess it that some viewers don't like to be drawn in, fooled, and then left wanting more. This is an excellent film with the rare capacity to keep you guessing - if you're willing to suspend your ego and go with it. Instead of red objects to give you clues, they come in the (GASP!) dialogue. You, as the viewer, must interact with your intelligence to decide who is the more evil, the more twisted, the most powerful, the more deceptive or the more in love. Delicious. Part of the problem is that a movie with this caliber of viewer participation is rare. Yes, Ed is handsome and convincing. Rufus is intense and real in his madness. Jessica is beautiful. Paul is devilishly fun and Eddie *is* his character. But the story is the most seductive partner in this crime."

","I didn't think I could see a recent film that would be better than V For Vendetta. I was sorely mistaken. This film was incredible. The acting was absolutely outstanding, but of course it would be - Edward Norton, one of the most talented actors of our time starred. How could a film featuring both Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti fail? Easily, it didn't. I originally thought that the casting for Sophie could have been better, but I underestimated the talent of Miss Biel. She gave a compelling performance as Sophie. The twist was fantastic as well. I am usually quite good at predicting movies, but the details of the ultimate outcome eluded me. The cinematography and costumes were as equally impressive as the acting. No matter which way you spin it, this movie was very impressive. A fantastic film that I am proud to keep in my movie cabinet."
"Evil_Magus","10","2","3","9 February 2007"," Spellbinding Cinematic Wizardry.
","One of the greatest movies I've seen in a while, one which definitely fits in that category of elite and favored films of mine that I simply watch it awe of. It's absolutely fantastic, and I'm disappointed by how poorly the Academy received it. I don't blame them, of course: As of yet I haven't seen a movie they chose that didn't deserve the nomination. Granted, also, I've been very lax, as of late, in my movie-going, and have only yet seen two of the best picture nominees (which I plan to rectify by the Big Night). At any rate, I would have loved to see this movie nominated for Best Picture. In my opinion this is a better movie than The Departed (and please don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved The Departed: this is only a testament to The Illusionist's qualities) and of the same notable parity as Little Miss Sunshine (only, clearly, in a much different fashion: serious drama and mystery, as opposed to dramady).<br/><br/>The movie stars Edward Norton in a role but like and unlike anything we've ever seen him in. He revels in the same mystery which he typically partakes in Fight Club (1999) and The Score (2001), and yet he does so in an extraordinarily reserved fashion. His speech is far more reserved, his eyes and features far more telling, than anything he's done before: and this is by far the greatest role he's ever undertaken.<br/><br/>I hate to use this terminology, but acting under him is Paul Giamatti, whose equally impressive performance provides a solid foundation to lay the movie on top of, acting in the same fashion as Edward Norton, although surely something he's had more experience with: reserved and carefully executed acting, although with a tad more pomp and flare than Norton This is likewise, in my opinion, his greatest role, although seeing what he's done in the past this is a matter of considerably more debate.<br/><br/>Jessica Biel provides a powerful and striking performance in a role that could have, in fact, probably would have, lagged behind and weighted the movie in the hands of a less experienced and less capable actress. Rufus Sewell provides an equally potent performance, one that warrants-- nay-- demands, a mention.<br/><br/>The directing is spectacular: absolutely magical, as it were. The special-effects are subtle and used to a pleasingly small degree, opting more for Norton's actual skills and sleights of hand for a more realistic show. Further, the magic was merely the setting, a catalyst for the story to take hold and grow, not a crutch in which to support a flimsy production.<br/><br/>The movie, in a word, was spellbinding."

","If you are looking for a movie that has great actors, amazing settings, a breath-taking story, wonderful costumes and photography, then you MUST see THE ILLUSIONIST. It is intriguing, shocking (in a good way) and sensational at the same time. The way colors blend into the picture really takes you back in time around the beginning of cinema...But what makes this movie brilliant is the impressive work of Edward Norton, who can go from calm to passionate, from calculate to desperate, from furious to broken to pieces, all in a glance. And the look in his eyes towards the climax of the film really stays with you. It's not just a movie about magic, it is magical!"
"jllehtola","10","2","3","3 February 2007"," Wonderfully romantic
","To me it seemed to more of 1870's Vienna. At essence is difference in class between Eisenheim and the royalty in Austria. A subplot might be the democratization of Austria. The power held by the crown prince is implicit. The castles, countryside and city cobblestone streets add to the mood. The lighting levels and tones are crafted to generate the air of mystery it so masterfully presents. The costume selections were great. There was even a green steam engine powered passenger train. The story line did not drag. I did need to go back to figure out a few details. I hope this movie is retained in the next round of format change."

It was a perfect blend of all the things that make a movie good. Edward Norton is a great actor as well as Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel. You couldn't of asked for a better cast.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","3","29 October 2006"," Love, honor, and magic
","During interrogation by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) in ""The Illusionist"", the magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton) confesses to his supporting crowd, ""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion."" Perhaps, everything we have seen has been a wonderfully crafted illusion by Director and Writer Neil Burger. Based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, ""The Illusionist"" is a tale ultimately about love, honor, and magic. This is a stark contrast to the other magicians' movie, ""The Prestige"" which is about the cost of fame and all consuming obsession. Edward Norton's powerful performance as illusionist Eisenheim, who pursues love and honor, inspires and compels in ""The Illusionist"". From that point of view, I enjoyed ""The Illusionist"" more. ""The Illusionist"" is an impassioned and timeless love story set in the world of magic of the late nineteenth century.<br/><br/>Before becoming Eisenheim the Illusionist, Edward became entranced with magic as a young boy. Edward's first love is Sophie. However, social privilege keeps them apart. Edward is from a poor family. Sophie is a young Duchess. Edward designs a keepsake of his love for Sophie, which she wears. Unfortunately, Edward is forced to leave to protect himself and his family.<br/><br/>Edward returns to Vienna as Eisenheim 15 years later. He is an accomplished magician of great talent. He rediscovers the love of his life Sophie (beautiful Jessica Biel) is still in Vienna, and about to be engaged to Prince Leopold (noble and unsavory Rufus Sewell). This arranged family marriage is purely for political leverage. Eisenheim has always loved Sophie, and she has always loved him. The suspicious and paranoid Leopold tasks his Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) with uncovering Eisenheim's secretsÂ—magic and personal. Uhl fancies himself as a magic amateur and fan. The magic performed in ""The Illusionist"" is spectacular. My bud Tom, who is an accomplished magician and student of the art, told me that these are classic magic tricks dating way back. So there is great authenticity and atmosphere to Burger's ""The Illusionist"". His final twist is more redemption, than merely shock.<br/><br/>The performances are impeccable. Edward Norton has this sublime power on screen as Eisenheim. He is a commanding presence, who is never over done. He brilliantly balances both compassion and angst. He breathes refreshing nobility within his character. Paul Giamatti is awesome. In a sense ""The Illusionist"" works, because of his believable performance as Inspector Uhl. This is particularly true in the amazing scene toward the end. Giamatti, always so natural, embodies such humanity. Jessica Biel is a welcome surprise. She is stunningly beautiful, and possesses an underlying strength and vulnerability as Sophie. Neil Burger orchestrates ""The Illusionist"" with masterful strokes. The storytelling is impassioned, stylish, and inspiring. ""The Illusionist"" is a great movie."

"Rogue-32","10","2","3","15 October 2006"," One of the best films of this year, last year, ANY year
","The Illusionist is one of the best movies I've ever seen, plain and simple. It's perfect in ways I never knew a film could be perfect. Instead of trying to come up with adjectives to describe the experience, I will suggest instead - or rather implore - that you vigorously ignore any comments that will give anything away about this magnificently masterful (OK, OK, those are adjectives) film and just go see it. <br/><br/>And no, I am not just saying this because Paul Giamatti (whom I have a group for at Yahoo - a not-so-subtle plug: http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/talkpaul/) co-stars in it and turns in yet another seamless, brilliant performance, and no, I'm not just saying this because I've always been a huge fan of my fellow Leo Edward Norton, who had me at hello years ago when I caught him in Primal Fear; this is an actor who has grown immensely with every role he's tackled since then, and his performance in this movie - along with Giamatti's - is Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>The Illusionist succeeds on levels that are far beyond the scope of any words, in any review. From the opening credits, there is a spell being cast, a palpable otherworldly feeling which permeates every frame of this masterpiece. What I'm saying is, the film starts off great and gets even greater. If you love movies like you say you love movies, this is the movie for you."
"walravej","10","2","3","9 October 2006"," Magnificent scenery, marvelous illusions
","The movie is about passion. Passion for magic, or should I say illusions, and passion for a woman. The question arises whether or not the illusionist is a real magician or (just) an illusionist. At the end of the movie it will be crystal clear. <br/><br/>So if you like magic tricks and (the illusion of the) supernatural, you will definitely be very pleased with this movie. The performance of both Edward Norton and Jessica Biel are quite convincing. Edward Norton's play differs very much from his performance in History X or The Fight Club. In this movie he plays the quite magician. <br/><br/>If you like mystery, magic and/or illusions, you have to see this movie."
"bford-1","10","2","3","9 October 2006"," Go to see The Illusionist for a reminder that film is magic.
","So far, none of the ""real' critics are suggesting this film as an Oscar possible, and I wonder why. It's not self-conscious like All the Kings Men, convoluted like Hollywoodland, or dragging heaps of unresolved issues behind it like The Departed. The Illusionist is satisfyingly complete and completely magical.<br/><br/>The plot carries you from an engrossing look at Eisenheim's--the illusionist's--childhood to his final appearance. His magical meeting with an old magician started him on this path, but like everything else,the stunning image of the magician plying his trade beneath a gnarled tree, comes to us second-hand, through a narrator. What should we believe? We can believe absolutely in the romance between the magician and his noble born beloved, a countess he met as a child. She was forbidden to play with him because he was a peasant, the son of a carpenter, but they managed to meet anyway. The same distance lies between them when they meet again as adults, but Eisenheim now possesses adult powers--or are they just tricks? As the plot takes you to its mesmerizing conclusion, you yearn to believe everything the illusionist does is real.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance gives the film a magnetic center, with great supporting players in his orbit. When Norton makes a little red ball roll lazily over the back of his hand and through his fingers, it looks as if he has been doing nothing but magic forever. The evil Prince (Rupert Sewall)is satisfyingly evil and Paul Giametti's inspector Uhl is convincingly drawn in by the illusionist, as we are.<br/><br/>A driving sense of urgency gives The Illusionist its power and makes it Oscar-worthy. Consumed by the events playing out before us, we're always enmeshed in the film's incredible beauty; the lush, inventive mise-en-scene, however, never seeks adulation because it's part of the whole, not an attempt to show how clever the director and/or cinematographer can be. Go to see this movie to remember what film can do best. It can create images that replay in your mind, like the two butterflies you'll still see after you leave the theater. It can remove you to an intact, other world, where you can revel in the playing out of human strengths and frailties. Although The Illusionist isn't overtly political and is set in the nineteenth-century, its themes of father/son battles over power, censorship, spiritualism versus materialism, and sustained love instead of carnal knowledge resonate today."

","Norton, Giamatti, and Sewell are all accomplished, intelligent actors and turned in very good performances, as expected. The question mark for me was Jessica Biel, after just watching Scarlett J, who is supposed to be the much better actress, doing a terrible job in Hollywoodland, another period piece. Doing the math after the end of the back story on the characters' childhoods, I wondered how Biel (who I think is still under 25) could play an aristocrat in her mid 30s when her last co-star was a talking plane. Instead she did a great job. She gave her character some depth and provided enough justification for why two very capable and powerful, each in his own way, men would fight for her. She reminds me of Jenny Agutter, an actress that I've always liked. Hopefully I won't see her in Blade 4 or Stealth 2 and now she'll get an opportunity for better roles."
"c00lsox","8","2","3","28 September 2006"," A brilliant movie
","Let me begin by saying that this is one of the best movies of 2006. Set in the late 19th century in Europe, The Illusionist follows the story of Eisenheim the Illusionist. The story is well done and paced superbly. The costumes and sets are absolutely convincing and the whole movie is shot in a sepia tone to give it that old world feel. Edward Norton acting in a role that is atypical for him puts in an Oscar-worthy performance. The supporting cast of Paul Giamatti as the police inspector and Jessica Biel as the Prince's soon-to-be wife are all excellent. I have no doubt that Norton, Giamatti and the movie itself will be nominated for Academy awards come March. If you go and see this movie, do yourself a favor and pay strict attention to all that is going on. You won't be sorry."

Its nice to see him play someone other than his usual angry outsider role. His character is calm, collected and captivating, and he plays the role of Eisenhiem the Illusionist with Oscar-worthy skill. Paul Giamatti plays every role like that, and this one is no exception. Jessica Biel is equally wonderful in her role as an Austrian duchess, betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold and seduced by Eisenhiem. <br/><br/>The plot is complex and will leave you guessing until right up to the end. Everything flows naturally and the dialog is very eloquently written. This is one of those films that really needs a couple of viewings and undivided attention for one to walk out with the full experience. <br/><br/>The Illusionist has proved to be a ray of light in an otherwise dull September at the movies. The next time you visit your local theater, The Illusionist deserves strong consideration."

","I literally knew zip about this film when I decided I wanted to see it. All I knew was that Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti were starring, and that it was about magicians. And I must note this; I love magic, David Blaine never ceases to make my eyes bug out. Then there's David Copperfield who I saw perform in person. That is what put me over the edge, for awhile I wanted to be a magician. That's why I think this film looked so compelling to me. Though, while there are sequences of magic tricks, you can tell they are just CG. That takes some of the magic of the magic tricks away. Nevertheless, this film is a great period film, with a twist at the end you don't see coming till two minutes before the film ends.<br/><br/>The title basically speaks for itself; ""The Illusionist"" is about an illusionist. I'm not going to elaborate on the plot, because one such reviewer did, and ruined an integral part for me. I'm not like that, so I'll leave it at that. Edward Norton does a great job as Eisenheim the Illusionist. Though I've noticed he's never really played a character other than the quiet and slightly disturbed ones. Paul Giamatti, who is always brilliant, plays Chief Inspector Uhl who is investigating whether or not Eisenheim is dealing with the supernatural. And, to tell you the truth, Jessica Biel as Eisenheim's forbidden love interest, Sophie, did admirably. I'm glad I got to see this marvelously crafted film because originally it wasn't supposed to come to Saginaw. Fortunate for me, it did.<br/><br/>So, other than a few minor quirks, everything was amazing. The plot was engrossing, the pacing and timing moved well, the cinematography was beautiful and filmed in a slight sepia tone, and the dialogue was well written except for one scene, where I guessing he had writers block.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a magical, dark, and funny film. But after seeing a trailer for another magician film-""The Prestige""- released next month, I'm predicting ""The Illusionist"" will disappear.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for some sexuality and violence."

A close-up of Giamatti's face is as if seeing a topographical map of the world -- with its ever-changing landscape. He is turbulent. Sewell is stoic (as required). The fall of Leopold's facade is his destiny. Sewell succeeds.<br/><br/>Jessica Biel is luminous as Sophie. As an aristocrat, what is asked of her as actress is a wan, noncommited countenance. She provides it well, and not simply because she has nothing to offer other than her beauty -- one senses this actress really knows what she is doing.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, an American actor of ability, does not (so much) disappoint -- rather, he is sorely miscast.

I was hesitant at first since Jessica Biel has not always picked the best movie roles, but she too was captivating and this might be the role that gives her a little bit of credit. The era is perfectly portrayed and the movie was captivating the entire way through. Even after the movie was over I found my self asking questions of how the illusionist was able to do what he did! I would recommend this movie to anyone that believes in the unbelievable and who wants to sit in awe throughout the movie.

But who is really surprising in his skill in a non-comedic role is Paul Giamatti (sp?) as the police chief. The theaters (I believe it is the same one used in Amadeus but am unsure) are beautiful. The time-period recreation is completely absorbing. The story takes several turns - it would be best to see this movie without talking to anyone about the plot and especially not reading any spoilers.

","""The Illusionist"" is a beautiful movie, artfully designed to seduce lovers of period pieces and high fantasy (such as myself). It's not particularly deep - nor is it necessarily all that brilliant. But, like any good conjurer's trick, this film is so delightful and entertaining that I think you're a spoilsport if you criticize it for being too insubstantial.<br/><br/>The high points are the production design (which is gorgeous) and the acting. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti speak in weirdly soft tones for much of the film, but they manage to convey a wide ranges of emotions anyway, and both of them play very compelling characters. I had no problem with Jessica Biel, either, perhaps because I never saw her ""teen"" movies and I'm not saddled with the preconception that she's a lightweight. Let me put it this way; she's certainly beautiful enough that I understand Norton's obsession with her! <br/><br/>Now, about that script. It's actually a bit simple, a bit fanciful. The plot twists are not too hard to predict, if you really want to predict them. But so what? I enjoyed the movie even though I suspected what the ending would probably be. And, unlike many commentators on this site, I didn't feel ""superior"" to the film simply because I figured out the mystery. Sometimes it's fun to watch even a predictable plot unfold.<br/><br/>I'm actually glad that Norton made a film like this, because I usually associate him with darker, more downbeat fare. ""The Illusionist"" is a very pleasant movie by his standards - like a dreamy sort of fairy tale. I enjoyed seeing him in something that's so much fun.<br/><br/>If you insist on over-thinking this film, I'm sure you'll figure out - and start to resent - all of its tricks. You'll see the wires, so to speak. As for me...I never look for the wires. I just let myself be carried along for the ride."

","The list of good things to come from the communist period of Russia and East Europe is quite short. At the top of the tiny list is the untouched great parts of cities that are still in a high state of 19th Century preservation. This great sanctuary makes a wonderful set for this superb film.<br/><br/>Here, we're immersed in the graceful era of cobblestones, gaslight and an equestrian society of high dress code, the great unwashed obviously so. Add to that a marvelously written script filled with the enchantment of surprise; all told, a delightful, artistic set of Chinese Boxes with a pearl at the center, a genuinely powerful yet socially impossible love. The surrounding outer boxes are the deeply etched characters of the story, the extraordinary photographic treatment and above all, the metaphysical music score of Philip Glass, a composer that has fascinated me from the earliest years of my adult life.<br/><br/>This production engages at all levels of appreciation. The outer box is the performances of the two central leads, critically acclaimed actors Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti who beguile us with a masterful balance of nuance and verve. The last ten minutes of the film are entrancing if not altogether unpredictable. This is one of those rare films that leaves me envious because I had nothing to do with its creation; very highly recommended"

We had to keep reminding ourselves of the title of the movie - it helps to keep focused on the story. Screenwriters attempt to lure you away to other ideas.

","I have seen this movie, and was greatly impressed! It reminded me of that wonderful movie of the great Swedish director, Ingmar Bergmann- in 1958- called ""The Magician"" listed as ""Ansiktet""- a similar tale of illusion- the acting in ""The Illusionist"" was superb- it was wonderfully staged in old Vienna (Czechoslovakia, I believe). So many items were left to the imagination- how did he pull off the supposed death of his loved one-(shades of ""Romeo and Juliet"")- and, in the end, as the realization of how it was pulled off, became clear to the Inspector- who liked magic and admired the magician- his facial reactions were perfect!<br/><br/>I love a mystery- and just to see the illusionist sit on the stage, with a wonderfully appreciative audience, waiting- waiting- one was left with the feeling; what was real, and what was illusion! I left the theater with a great sense of admiration. Would love to see it again!"

I felt transported into another time and place, and though the ending can be determined well into the film, I was never sure if I was right. And if I was right, I wasn't sure how it could be accomplished.<br/><br/>I did notice what I considered to be a plot hole. The girl that played the young Sophie had some crooked teeth (refreshing in today's cookie cutter world) and the grown Sophie did not. I wasn't aware they had orthodontia in Victorian Vienna. Modern dentistry of our time, however can make false teeth to match just about any description. It's a petty thing. Another equally petty thing...what was with all the bad dye jobs on everybody's beard. You could see the blonde roots and other patches of blonde hair on the face of several characters.

First of all Best Picture, Best Director Neil Burger (don't know who you are, but you are wonderful), Best Adapted Screenplay (once again, Burger...great job adapting Steven Millhauser's short story), Best Musical Composer (Philip Glass, the composer of the spellbinder 1983's masterpiece Koyaanisqatsi...he does it again with this movie). Edward Norton deserves a Best Actor nod for his mesmerizing performance and Paul Giamatti deserves another Supporting Actor nomination (and hopefully he wins this one).

","It was either going to be Whicker Man or The Illusionist and thanks to IMDb we chose the better of the two which was The Illusionist. I read a few comments on this film and most of them were praising it. There were a few that said the acting by Jessica Biel was bad and that the ending was predictable. I didn't think Jessica put in an Oscar performance but she certainly wasn't bad - she did a fine job, i would have to say there was a part or two that were a little predictable but by no means did these two things make the movie bad in anyway. The movie keeps the viewer very much interested and Ed Norton does a great job as usual. Paul Giammati proves once again why he is one of the better actors in the business right now, he does a great job playing a chief inspector trying to discover how the mysterious magician played by Ed Norton does these very fascinating illusions. It is a little bit of a love story but it is not over done in anyway, it is suspenseful and will have you anxious to see the outcome, which I'm sure will not let you down.

","Story: The ""twist"" itself isn't really too much of a twist, especially for the current generation of audience who's been getting smarter and more alert. The overall story itself is rather generic  love triangle, a murder case, with a bit of political thrills thrown in. But there's something hypnotic and compelling about the plot  a mysterious mixture of magic and reality. If the main character is say an ordinary bank executive, instead of a magician/illusionist, the movie would lose much of its compels and appeals. The uncertainty about whether and when it crosses the realm of reality gives the movie an immense feel of suspense. It's story-telling at its finest  it relentlessly grabs hold of your attention till the very last scene.<br/><br/>Acting: Ed Norton is good, Rufus Sewell is great, and Paul Giamatti is simply amazing. What more can be said? <br/><br/>Production: The music and lighting are greatly effective, and the set and costumes are first-rate. Watching the movie is like seeing a wonderful magic show. While you are acutely aware that everything portrayed on the other side of the silver screen is hardly believable, you are keen to get carried away into this fantastic parallel universe and indulge yourself in all the tricks and magic it has to offer. By the time the end credits roll, you might feel reluctant to pull yourself back into the reality."

I loved being taken back to that time in a different world and seeing two souls connect again after a very long absence. What really got to me first of all was the performance of Edward Norton. He is incredible. Then I loved the transformation of Paul Giamatti's character when he realized what Eisenheim had done. It was thrilling. I thought the whole plot was laid out in a very clever manner and I left the theater thinking I had seen a really good motion picture. I really recommend this movie.

","What a treat to go to a theater and experience magic. The Illusionist is not a remake, completely original. It's based on a short story that was written by a Pulitzer Prize winning author. The feeling of the movie isn't spooky, its not like a Shyamalan thriller where the music and images intend to shock, although it could have been. Instead the filmmakers let the performances, editing, and strong symbolic and poetic storyline take the audience through the movie. Highly entertaining and imaginative. The time period adds a lot to the picture, as far as the look and feel of the film and the government and belief systems of the people. Beautiful filming with well thought out shots. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti give great performances. They carry the film well. I also appreciate the performance of Rufus Sewell as the Crown Prince, not a recognizable name, but you'll recognize the face. Go see it, too bad my wife and I had to go to an art house theater. Hopefully it wins an award for best screenplay adaptation and that creates some buzz. I can honestly say, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'll definitely buy it."

It has been a long, long time since we had to be in a line for a movie, but this one had the mood, the photography, the serious story line to keep your attention as it played itself out. Of course the magic wasn't real, i.e., it was too good for anyone to have done it in reality, but we went along with it because we believed in the love story. And the love story was seriously done, and was the heart of the movie from beginning to end. And not just some sex thrown in."

","A great performance by Ed Norton and fine direction by Neil Burger make The Illusionist a fine watch. The Illusionist is almost an art house/mainstream hybrid, containing elements of both. The setting and budget are in accord with what one might expect from a movie in a limited run. The cast, however, contains a trio of high profile names, one of which is commonly associated with teen-friendly multiplex fare. In addition, Burger's story is at its heart a crowd-pleaser, and many who guess the film's ""trick"" won't hold it against The Illusionist. Those who are sticklers for detail may appreciate that most of the magic acts illustrated throughout the film are replicated from their real-life 19th century counterparts (some of which were surprisingly sophisticated for that day and age). The Illusionist is a great watch- it looks great, is acted impeccably, and is a nice treat to those who complain of not seeing the 1800s presented on screen."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","1","1","2 February 2019"," Life and death. Space and time. Fate and chance. Theses are the forces of the universe.
","The Illusionist is directed by Neil Burger and Burger adapts the screenplay from ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"" written by Steven Millhauser. It stars Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell. Music is by Philip Glass and cinematography by Dick Pope.<br/><br/>How splendid, a period romantic mystery that's filled with the mysticism of magical conjurings and political volatility. Plot essentially has Norton as Eisenheim The Illusionist, who later in life runs into Sophie (Biel), his childhood sweetheart, and finds that she's on course to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell). Leopold has a bad reputation and it's not long before Eisenheim comes under Leopold's disdain, forcing Eisenheim to try and pull off the ultimate magic act to save Sophie and himself.<br/><br/>Creator Neil Burger crafts a picture that has everything going for it. The story is rock solid with intrigue credentials, where appropriately for a story based around magic tricks nothing is ever as it seems. The period flavours are smartly assembled, the Czech Republic locations smartly standing in for turn of the century Vienna, the art production is on point with the era of setting, as is the costuming. Glass drifts a tender melancholic score over the piece, while Pope's cinematography is simply gorgeous, offering up colour lensing that's aura enhancing, the kind you could get lost in for days.<br/><br/>The magic tricks are beguiling, as they should be and are in fact required since the narrative tantalisingly suggests Eisenheim may have supernatural powers? The story itself has no historical worth, but is fascinating none the less. It all builds towards its revelations, and much hinges on if the pay off is worth the admission fee? Most assuredly so it is, even if from a personal point of view this writer wouldn't have minded if pic had finished five minutes before the final revelation.<br/><br/>Either way, and with smart acting (Giamatti as the police inspector standing out) without histrionics holding things at the top end, this is delicate film making that engages the emotions fully for entertainment rewards. 8/10"

","This movie has the unfortunate luck of being released the same time as The Prestige. It often gets confused with that film and it should not. This film in my opinion is just as good, and is different from the other film which makes this comparison a bit phony. <br/><br/>A dark film using locations in the Czech Republic effectively as a back ground, magic is not really the subject here much. Illusion is more of the subject. A forbidden love between children of different classes finally gets started when after the kids are broken up because their families are of different classes, not unusual in 19th century Europe. About half way through the film, after they reunite adults, she is murdered.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is brilliant as Eisenheim, the Illusionist whose act is beyond magic. Paul Giamatti is great as Inspector Uhl, the detective who has to cover up Jessica Biel Sophie's death for political reasons. Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold is the reason for the cover-up, in position to become King until his Sophie, his Dutchess to become Princess, is murdered.<br/><br/>This film is a look at lost love, murder, obsession, and Illusion and is done as well as any story I have seen filmed. The illusion at the end is worth being around for. Or perhaps is it real? The film leaves it to the viewer to decide. No narrator here, the characters and events carry the story well enough to make a narrator unneeded."

","There was a period (2006) when there were a lot of movies about magicians (okay two). 'The Illusionist' was one of them. At the time I figured, 'you've seen one...' and you know the rest. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it the other night. A great cast of interesting characters that draw you into a story that otherwise is the standard fare. The movies tries to deliver on two levels: as a romance and a 'bro'mance - which left me wanting a little more of both frankly.

","This Movie is my all time favorite which i have seen more then 10 times. The Illusionist is infectious mix of drama, mystery and romance. t's an exquisitely crafted period picture that keeps promising more and more as it goes along--smarter ideas, richer themes, spookier plot twists--and keeps delivering on every promise, right up until the rug- pulling and overly hasty final sequence. Eisenheim's storybook romance with Sophie (Jessica Biel), the childhood sweetheart now expected to become Leopold's princess, is the most compelling thing about a film. Sophie in childhood says when they were caught together ""Make us Disappear"" and when Eisenheim is back as a grownup he tells Sophie during one of his performance ""Perhaps i will make you disappear"" that rang a bell for Sophie, astonishing way to tell her that he is back. Overall a brilliant piece of work."

","My friend recommended this film to me saying it reminded him of Now You See Me, though I don't see much of a correlation except for the magical element. The story is not that focused on the magical element though that does play a big part in creating the illusion of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is great, with the chemistry sizzling between Norton and Biel. Norton carries his character well and his charisma shines through the screen. Biel too does great in her role and with the costumes smoothly fits into that time era. What really shines as well is the acting by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Eleanor Tomlinson who play the young versions of Eisenheim and Sophie. The emotions they convey transcend the screen and feel pretty authentic.<br/><br/>The setting of the film creates a nice atmosphere that complements the time period they are depicting. The colours have a very reminiscent feel to them with brownish and dark colours illustrating the past era. The costumes too are elegant and classy with long trench coats for the men and frilly dresses for the women- though the only female character in the film is pretty much Sophie. My goodness, I had a pretty big problem with that. Sophie was the only female character who was kind of like the other protagonist, but then she doesn't get much screen time. What. I was flipping out a little. Adding to that, I was a little peeved at the introduction of Asian characters who didn't speak and only served as muscle power.<br/><br/>The story itself though is not entirely unpredictable, is still quite fascinating. However, I wished the film had shown more magical tricks, instead of focusing so much on the romance line. Also, the film cuts through the chronological order quite a bit which for the most part helped in creating the mystery of the story, but some bits were still a little confusing to match the events altogether. <br/><br/>Overall though it was still a well made film with great acting and an interesting storyline.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

"willcundallreview","7","1","1","19 April 2015"," A mystifying end
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>The Illusionist is a mystery drama movie set in Vienna at the end of the 19th century, with magic on show and a royal who doesn't like it much. The movie is an interesting one, the plot is very intriguing and really makes you think quite a bit about what will happen next. I think the movie also stays with you afterwards as you fully realise what has happened in the movie, a kind of nice after taste if you will.<br/><br/>It has a smart plot and feels even smarter as the credits roll, there is no doubt this will please many many fans but I did feel this movie thinks it is much smarter than it is. Now it is not that the film has been done before necessarily, it is just that the plot when thought about is good but in truth you can see the producers really wanted people to leave and think ""Wow that was amazing"" and try to win you over on only one element of the story.<br/><br/>The movie is well acted all round and the cast are picked well, Edward Norton is fine as our main character Eisenheim and he manages to confidentially play out a difficult role. Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector Uhl is good as well, the way in which his character has two faces in a way really makes this a defining role for Giamatti in cinema. Jessica Biel is fine as the Duchess and although she isn't great, her role is very important in the end, with Rufus Sewell's portrayal of the Crown Prince Leopold also a very fine and important role all together too.<br/><br/>Neil Burger writes and directs the movie and he does both well mixing together elements which haven't been done before and bringing in the tried and tested to create an all round good film. Above all he directs well here and it is one of the best things about this, Burger manages to bring not only the most out of the characters but also true emotion and it can't be said that you don't feel for the characters if not a little by the end in anyway.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong the movie can have it's dull moments although it isn't bad I don't mean, I am just saying that the scenes can around the middle to middle ending feel too dull and as if everything happening is completely predicted. The real pay off as I have said is of course the end and I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen this, but let's just say that you have to wait until the end to really get the full force of this movie.<br/><br/>The film is even well researched, it goes well with a true story in history about the Crown Prince and the duchess and takes a new if not absurd spin on the story, well for some maybe it is absurd. I liked the setting of the movie, Vienna provides a beautiful backdrop and one of the defining things about this is the architecture, it may make you want to go on holiday there after viewing I have no doubt. <br/><br/>Overall it is a good piece of cinema and one that will be remembered, As I said it thinks it is smarter than it really is so some may watch this and really love it like a lot. It is though a smart plot in fairness and a smart movie all round, the cleverness of the team in directing and writing and also the acting makes this a fine movie and one that may have some calling for why certain actors didn't get award nominations."

But what's interesting is the point of view. All the while when we presume that it's based on what the illusionist perceives, it's also what people around him think.

So we have a winner as a film aficionados and I loved this for all this.<br/><br/>The climax where he brings back his own past, did mesmerize me just as it did to all the audience withing the film.

","Director: Neil Burger, Genre: Drama, Mystery<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on Steven Millhauser's short story, Eisenheim the Illusionist. Director Neil Burger has ensured great visual consistency, with the story weaving fluidly through various locations, he has treated each locale as a vital part of the story. The movie is a love-story about a young carpenter boy who is in love with a duchess, but they are separated due to society constraints. He comes back as a reputed magician. Alongside, the duchess is about to marry a prince who has decided to overthrow the emperor. Rest of the movie is about the boy's clever plans to get rid of the Prince. Neil tries to bring in the romance, suspense, love, hate, jealousy, arrogance and ego in divulging the nuances of various characters. In spite of the movie having different threads all flowing simultaneously, Neil manages to tie them all together very well and never lets anyone get too far ahead of the other. The actors too have done a marvelous job. Ed Norton (the boy) is mesmerizing, Jess Biel (the duchess) is stunningly beautiful and Paul Giamatti (a police officer) playing an admirable role takes the viewer by surprise in many elements of the story. Even though illusions were not clearly explained in the end, the grand finale where ""all is revealed"" remains a satisfying conclusion for the patient viewer fulfilling the lofty promises of the themes presented throughout the work. As a whole, the movie was a nice experience. It clearly portrays how the ambition can take its toll on even an intelligent man while love can make people do anything even if it is murder in a sort."

Norton gives an incredible performance that will literally make you feel like you are in the movie experiencing it with him. If you don't see this movie before you die then you FAILED at life. Okay that was over dramatic but still. This is my favorite movie of all time and I recommend that every single person needs to see it at some point in their life. You will NOT be disappointed."

","Neil Burger's brilliance shines again in his 2006 production of The Illusionist. Starring the gifted Edward Norton, as Eisenheim, the skillful and talented magician who keeps the plot moving and always has you wondering how did he do that? The gorgeous Jessica Biel plays the part of Sophie, the beautiful and sumptuous Duchess Von Teschen. When volunteered to help Eisenheim perform a trick by her fiancé, Sophie and Eisenheim's are reunited after not seeing each other for fifteen years due to social status and class differences. This reunion must be fate because once they see each other it's not an illusion, its love. As Eisenheim and Sophie rekindle their long lost lustful feelings for one another, they know that the Crown Prince, Sophie's fiancé, will not let her go without a fight. After Eisenheim humiliates the Crown Prince at a show, he is arrested and stowed in the local jail. It is when Sophie confronts the Prince in the barn that the plot thickens. <br/><br/>Confusion and illusion take full effect as you try to guess who the real villain is. Is it the Crown Prince, whose poor reputation of unkind womanly acts has been masked for years by his wealth and status? Or is the mystery, mind puzzling, and handsome magician? Neil Burger keeps you guessing up to the last second. Using special techniques throughout the movie, Mr. Neil Burger, as in his other acclaimed films Crash and Sideways, has mastered the art of creating a fantasy. The use of time appropriate candle lighting during Eisenheim's theater performances creates a dark and eerie feeling. You want to close your eyes but can't for fear that you might miss something.<br/><br/>As Eisenheim's audiences are dressed in dark clothing and have radiopaque skin, this stark color contrast makes you feel as thou you are in a morgue, which adds to the overall eerie feeling that is present throughout the film. This feeling is part of Eisenheim's ever enchanted life of as a magician, as people disappear, knives hide in forbidden places, and people appear to be immortal, don't be fooled. For 110 minutes, you will be guessing who, where, and what just happened as the plot is never as it seems, but an illusion. This film has it all; from profound jaw dropping magic, a forbidden love affair, crime, and drama. So be prepared for a ride that is full speed and full of sharp turns or so they appear to be."

","In 19th century Vienna, cabinet maker's son Edward becomes friends with young aristocrat Sophie, but they are separated due to the class difference. Years later they meet as adults when Edward is a stage illusionist and Sophie is on the point of becoming engaged to deeply unpleasant Crown Prince Leopold. They are in love, but can they ever be together? The Illusionist succeeds on nearly every level. The story is solid, and well told through the police Inspector who is involved at every stage, the cast are uniformly excellent, and the whole thing is handsomely mounted - this is a beautiful looking film.<br/><br/>I have one reservation (a mild one in the context of the film overall) but it involves spoilering the film, so look away now. Unlike the contemporaneous The Prestige, the magic in this film is supposedly all illusion. I would therefore have liked to know how Edward achieved the illusion of the small boy walking round the theatre apparently exchanging communicative glances with patrons - I can't think how that could be done with current technology!"

","""The Illusionist"" was released in the same year as ""The Prestige"". Both deal with magic and mystery. Definitely, it would be absurd to write a movie review comparing with another movie, but it's important to have some sort of benchmark for comparison, a benchmark nearly achieved by ""The Prestige"" and missed by ""The Illusionist"".<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" stars Edward Norton. This ever bankable actor has the ability to carry the entire movie on his shoulder and he nearly does the same here. Supported well by Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti, the film has a good casting, a feat achieved by 'The Prestige"" too.<br/><br/>The strength of this movie includes its sets and screenplay. The movie has a haunting atmosphere that greatly adds to the tension maintained throughout the movie. The sets are very believable and the entire aura greatly corresponds the movie's mysterious theme. The running time is good and the movie pace is very engaging and audience will always crave for details. If you consider the set design, movie pace and screenplay; ""The Illusionist"" scores better than ""The Prestige"".<br/><br/>The biggest drawback of ""The Illusionist"" is the lack of trick details and the climax. Having said that, I like the climax of ""The Illusionist"", but none of the tricks preformed by Ed Norton were ever explained and hence, even though liking the twist ending, one never gets to know the authenticity of the twist. On the other hands, every bit of tricks is revealed in ""The Prestige' and hence, the end twist completely augur well with the film plot and the tricks preformed.<br/><br/>Overall, watch this movie. Everyone who has seen this movie has liked it. But if you have panache for details, then you might be disappointed. Or, you can take up the challenge and crack the Illusionist's tricks.<br/><br/>My Verdict: 7/10"

","When this film was released, I was wondering whether I should watch this film or ""21"" and after all I chosen this one and watch ""21"" at a theatre. Therefore, ""The illusionist"" kept being left for a while. I think again Edward Norton is a great actor. In the story, Eisenheim, an illusionist, who has to ""play a role"" who lost his lover. If you think about it, it sounds strange that an actor plays a role who plays a different role in a story. I can't say too much not to spoil the story...<br/><br/>The story is about Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and Sophie (Jessica Biel) fell in love in childhood but their love, which they wish to have the everlasting love however, had to be ended due to the differences of realm. Since he saw an illusionist as a child, he was fascinated by the illusion and created various kind of tricks, and acquired as a position of the illusionist. One day, he invited a women from the audience to feel his illusion at his stage. The woman is the lady who he fell in love in childhood. She has a finance at the moment but their love between Sophie and Eisenheim is profound and decide to escape from her state. That night, her fiancé Loepold (Rufus Sewell) killed Sophie due to his anger of Sophie's betrayal when she left the castle. While Eisenheim with his suffer heartache, exhibits an illusion creating visional apparition at his stage...<br/><br/>A tricky thing with its features creating an illusion, tricks or magic in a film is kinda cheating in a film, but I think it's not a live performance and everything is acceptable in a film. Any special effect or unrealistic magic could be made in a film. When I saw ""Prestige"" (2006) felt the same way; ""That's cheating! cos it's a film"". This time again makes me feel the same way. Other than that, a good movie makes the audience feel great."

Rufus Sewell gives the best performance and he is amazing to watch. The cinematography and set and costume designs are wonderful and create a very well-done era of magic. The score is also brilliant.

","The ""Illusionist"" is a well-made movie with excellent performances from Edward Norton as the maker of illusions, Jennifer Biel as the aristocrat he loves and Paul Giamatti as a detective inspector in the service of the Austro-Hungarian Embassy. The script is tightly driven, maintaining a surprisingly high degree of tension considering that many of the scenes toward the end of the movie consist of Eisenheim (Norton's character) sitting in a chair on an empty stage staring out at the audience until a person apparently materializes on stage, says a few words and then vanishes into the thin air from which he or she originally came. The fourth principal in the film is a prince of the empire, to whom Biel's character is affianced. The prince, who is plotting to stage a coup ousting his father, becomes Eisenheim's deadly enemy, operating through the detective inspector, hoping to become a grand figure if his patron succeeds in his plot. It is highly enjoyable."

It might not equal the unrivaled charisma and power of The Prestige, but The Illusionist is a brooding, sorrowful tale of magic, treachery and love in itself.<br/><br/>Ed Norton does a typically excellent job, as do Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti, and the atmosphere is dark and, at times, unrelentingly aggressive and angry, despite the tragedy that seems to coat it all. The story pulls you in right from the start, and it doesn't let up for a good 2 hours or so, twisting and turning like an uncoiling serpent. Get this one if you like good cinema."

The sets were gorgeous, but a little sparse with people. I think a bit more bustle in the streets of Vienna would have added just a bit to this movie, but it didn't take anything away either. I felt like I was part of each audience watching the magic acts, I could smell the forest as the Duchess tracked down Eisenheim, I could feel the chill of the river as Eisenheim plunged in, and I felt it was a very clever movie. No assuming its viewers are stupid on this one, though there are some similarities between this and The Prestige.<br/><br/>I don't want to give the plot away. There are some good twists.

Edward brings a dedication and persona to all his roles which draw in the audience to his at times troubled world.

"shhimundercoverdamnit","7","1","1","15 October 2007"," The Illusionist
","Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton lead an all-star cast in The Illusionist, a film that conjures up an exhilarating blend of suspense, romance and mind-bending twists.<br/><br/>The acclaimed illusionist Eisenheim( Norton) has not only captured the imaginations of all of Vienna, but also the interest of the ambitious Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). But when the Prince's new fianc?e, Sophie ( Jessica Biel) rekindles a childhood relationship with Eisenheim, the Prince's interest evolves into obsession....and suddenly the city's Chief Inspector Uhl ( Giamatti) finds himself investigating a shocking crime. But even as the inspector engages him in a dramatic challenge of wills, Eisenheim prepares for his most impressive illusion yet.<br/><br/>Though the film has quite a slow pace, it is helped along by outstanding production values, a mysterious subject filed with all kinds of twists and turns, and some decent acting.<br/><br/>The real revelation here is none other than Paul Giamatti as the Chief Inspector, he is basically our eyes and ears-as he is more than anything the part of the audience, trying to figure how everything figures out. Is Eisenheim just an illusionist or is he something much more? Such as the controller of supernatural forces? My favorite scene from the film is probably the one where Eisenheim appears to have the ability to create life and bring back souls from the dead --by making the ghosts of real people appear and speak onstage. That scene with the little boy is kinda creepy.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, is in typical great form as the lead character Eisenheim. No other actor could have made this character work as well, as he manages to in this film. Rufus Sewell, chews up some scenery as well, in what at first seems like a role he has done countless times before. Even so, I liked the way he portrayed his character. In a way, the audience really learns to hate him and his arrogant and cruel ways. However, this is a certain twist that occurs at the end of this film, that raises some serious questions about two of the film's main characters.<br/><br/>Jessica Biel's beauty shines, but she seems a little bit out of her league here. For one, her accent is kind ridiculous. Is she, British or Austrian? In at least one major scene, she is switching between an English, German, and then back to her American accent! God damn, pick one and stick with it.<br/><br/>The one thing the film does as well is that it leaves open for interpretation whether Eisenheim had special powers or if that was in fact all an illusion as well. However, there is that scene where he addresses his supporters from the baclony and proclaims "" Everything you have seen and everything you will see is just an illussion!"" In fact, the theme of the film may just be a parable about the nature of power and its abuses.<br/><br/>Well worth a look, ladies and gents."
"segacs","8","1","1","14 October 2007"," Beautiful, unusual and eminently watchable
","Is there any acting role that the fantastically talented Edward Norton can't pull off? In ""The Illusionist"", he takes on the role of Eisenheim, the turn-of-the-century Viennese magician and entertainer who gets caught up in a love triangle. And what we get as an audience is a real treat: A beautifully-shot, superbly acted, mind-bending mystery and love story.<br/><br/>The plot is at once simple and complex. On its face, it's a basic love triangle between Eisenheim, his childhood love, the Duchess Sophie, and her fiancé, who just so happens to be the Crown Prince (and who has a streak of jealousy and a nasty temper). Eisenheim and Sophie reconnect after she attends one of his performances, and the tension builds as the audience is left to wonder how the whole thing will play out.<br/><br/>Edward Norton plays Eisenheim as an inscrutable, mysterious man who can speak volumes with his eyes. Paul Giamatti is a pleasant surprise in his role as the not-entirely-corrupt Chief Inspector Uhl. And Rufus Sewell is a treat as the villain in the movie, Crown Prince Leopold.<br/><br/>The one thing that threatened to ruin this movie for me was the casting of Jessica Biel as Sophie. A lot of people maintain that this movie proves her acting ability; I disagree. She was wooden, cardboard almost, and her performance looked ridiculously amateurish next to the skills of Norton and company. Sorry, guys, I know you might like to look at her, but she can't act.<br/><br/>Besides that, this is a fantastic movie and is highly worth seeing. No, I won't ruin the ending for you, if you haven't been spoiled already. But I will say that, unlike the Sixth Sense, this movie is an enjoyable journey whether or not you see the destination coming.<br/><br/>8/10. Quality."
"teekayu8","9","1","1","30 September 2007"," This movie restrores me back to life
","There are 5 films that did just that to me: The Fountain, Taxi Driver, Fight Club, Deer Hunter, and Gattaca. The entire sequences of the film reminds us of the forgotten art of black-and-white films. The way the lighting and the camera focuses in the middle of the scene, the breath-taking use of lights, and gorgeous composed music. This movie makes you feel as if you are in a dream, hypnotize...whatever you may call it; and leave you thinking and trying to find the secrets that lies beyond the illusion...but you won't find it until Neil Burger give you a glimpse of what is going on, since you are already became a part of the illusion. You will feel magical. REAL magic is what this film possessed. And the best part of it is: you absorb the movie and it became a part of you. Those feeling never left. That overwhelms me with indescribable warmth that surge through me until now, that I am typing this. <br/><br/>Do not compare this with 'The Prestige'. Just because 'Spartacus' is set in Rome doesn't means it is the same as 'Cleopatra'. But since 'The Prestige' came out first, the shining light of this film is blackened. <br/><br/>This one deserve a watch. More than that, actually. Do not REMEMBER 'The Prestige' when you watch this. It is a totally different movie with a totally different formulas that does not disappoint anyone looking for a good movie. <br/><br/>It's a real treat. 9/10 ."
"jpschapira","7","1","1","2 June 2007"," A kind of comparison...
","I knew I wanted to watch this film, but before doing so I had been asking myself a question: ""Will I able to write about 'The Illusionist' without comparing it to 'The Prestige'? Now I know the answer; which is yes. However, a friend of mine asked me to do a kind of comparison; that's why I'll highlight some information as I write about ""The Illusionist"" on its own.<br/><br/>First of all, in my opinion ""The Prestige"" is better than ""The Illusionist"", but apart from the fact that both contain a person doing magic on a stage, they are very different films. Mainly, the first one is the story of a rivalry; this movie is the story of a romance. As I said, slight kind of comparisons so that they don't take over the review.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much, ""The Illusionist"" the story of Edward, a peasant who later becomes a wizard (or however you may call it) and, as a young man, falls in love with a Dutchess (Jessica Biel). This we all learn from words spoken by Inspector Ull (a fantastic Paul Giamatti), who is telling the wizard's (now known as Eisenheim) life to the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) after an apparent arrest.<br/><br/>Now, when the story is told, the camera darkens the corners of the main image, so we can be transported to the past. The picture looks beautiful with its predominant light brownish tone (accompanied by Philip Glass's haunting score), still kept when things seem to go back to the present; and with the black screen closing up as a little circle as in old films. But if I have to be objective, something basically doesn't fit: and it is that the story told by the Inspector (which constitutes the film) has facts of no interest or of previous knowledge to the listener, the Prince; which would make it sort of useless for him to listen to the 'whole' story.<br/><br/>Maybe this comes from the fact that the screenplay, by the director Neil Burger, is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser that, as a film, runs long at 100 minutes. While undoubtedly a good film, it's betrayed by two bland performances of the young actors who fail to transmit the main romance the film deals with.<br/><br/>This is mended by the performances of the older actors, though. Edward Norton is, once more, totally immersed in his character, obtaining (once more) a very peculiar accent and a good use of body language. There's a scene after the lovers meet again, where Eisenheim is invited to the Prince's house to perform and, in order to make the Dutchess recognize him, he says something. It's not only what he says, but also the way Norton looks at her as he says it and then again when she looks back; is a little detail of Norton's mastery.<br/><br/>And the way Jessica Biel looks back, only in that exact moment, proves that she was a good choice for the role; even when a big number of actresses could have done it better.<br/><br/>At last, the twistI'm not giving anything away here, but we live in a time where when a movie has a twist, it is not ruined or given away; but it is mentioned. It is not likely that someone who hasn't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"" rents the film without knowing there's a twist.<br/><br/>Well, you may remember ""The Prestige"" has a twist; ""The Illusionist"" also has one. The way I see it, in ""The Prestige"" the twist generates a big impact: you're blown away and you can't believe it; while in ""The Illusionist"" the twist is too much to take in at the moment it is presented. Think about that when you watch the film; and also think if ""The Illusionist"" would have done better without the twist (because I do) and if you want to watch it again when it finishes (because I didn't), like with ""The Prestige""."

A very intelligent movie, from the begin to the end; different, from my point of view, from ""The prestige"", which tells about power and corruption and perversion of who this power has got: in ""The illusionist"", magic is not used like a cunning to become rich or powerful, to have success or glory: it's only an outline to resist to the life adversities.

","Sometimes it's good to see movies that are not too pretentious, not too full of themselves. I don't know exactly how you spot them, and set them apart from the movies that just want too much. It's not necessarily the themes or the visual style, nor is it the script. But there is something there. The Illusionist tells a story in a straight-forward way while still letting you think for yourself. I like that.<br/><br/>The first notable thing about this movie is the acting. Edward Norton is one of my favorites, not least because his best work is usually quite minimalist. In this movie that is definitely the case. Norton is toned-down and excellent. Jessica Biel on the other hand shows that she is not just a pretty face, she does well. But the real star i found to be Rufus Sewell as the crown prince. I have know before that he's a good actor, but he excels here. His subdued rage and mood-swings are beautiful.<br/><br/>The second thing i noticed was the visual style. It has a very nice touch to it. It comes in pale, almost sepia-toned, colors with a very nice ""old film""-style to it. The environments in Vienna are beautiful and the sets are a wonderful recreation of the late 19th century. The quite understated score from Phillip Glass complements the visual style nicely.<br/><br/>The third and last thing is the plot. I really liked the way that it's straight-forward and yet... not. Even after the movie stops rolling it's not so easy to say what you just saw. Was it real or was it illusions. Paul Giamattis character ends the movie with a laugh that's almost maniacal, and i know how he felt. Movies are about illusions and perceptions. The people making ""The Illusionist"" understands this. In a time when audiences are constantly underestimated, and points are driven in with a sledgehammer more often than not, a movie that leaves you thinking is worth a lot, even if the plot itself is not advanced nor exceptional.<br/><br/>This is hardly set to become a classic, or most peoples favorite pick for movie of the year. It's not that kind of movie. However it is proof that you can raise the bar with very small means, and make a solid movie just be respecting the audience. Very recommended. I rate this 7/10."
"seawalker","6","1","1","7 May 2007"," Old fashioned twist-in-the-tale thriller
","The reviews over here have been pretty much up and down on ""The Illusionist"" but I must confess I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is very serious (is he ever anything but serious?), Paul Giamatti is charming and ambiguous, Rufus Sewell is back to his hissable villain best and Jessica Biel gives a performance, rather than just being eye candy. (I never knew she had it in her.) They made the movie happen.<br/><br/>Forget any comparisons with ""The Prestige"" (a superior film), ""The Illusionist"" is really an old fashioned twist in the tale thriller, concerned with slight of hand and fooling the audience. What you think is going on might not be what is going on. It's not completely successful. Maybe I've just seen too many movies, because I guessed what was happening about half way through. However, it didn't spoil it. Sometimes the predictable clockwork plot can be comforting. I'll also say that ""The Illusionist"" looks wonderful. All monochrome, browns and greys. Really atmospheric. Horses, gaslight, smoke and mirrors. I love the whole look of Victorian-era set movies."

I have to admit that I fast forwarded a few scenes, since I think it's a bit too slow paced for a thriller, too predictable for a romance, and at times illogical even for a magic movie... The explanation at the end of the movie seems not good and logical enough for my liking. <br/><br/>The plot, I think, is supposed to have a twist, but I hardly found it surprising at all!

","The Illusionist is not a brilliant film, but it is nice. If you think that it is about somebody like Houdini and his tricks, then you are mistaken. The main hero, played by excellent Edward Norton, named Eisenheim, is an extremely talented illusionist, whose shows attract great attention and have no explanation. But this simple plot is weighed much by the fact that the whole story takes place in visibly calm but internally tense Vienna, where His Royal Highness is plotting against his father, an Emperor of Austrian  Hungarian empire, to take his throne. Mr. Eisenheim is suddenly in the very midst of this political turmoil, which is only mad worse by his romantic affair with Prince's bride-to-be. The seemingly slow and peaceful film in fact gets in quicker with every minute and the whole whirlwind of events is flying high. Till the end of the film we have no idea who is dead or alive, who is going to win or lose, who is right or wrong. This is a great, up-tempo story, with political killings, love, tricks and mystery. Sometimes, the film seems to become openly mystical, sometimes, very realistic. This is what it makes it so very thrilling and catchy."
"Robert_Hearth","9","1","1","14 April 2007"," ""Everything You Have Seen Here Has Been An Illusion."" --- Eisenheim (Edward Norton)
","""The Illusionist"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Neil Burger <br/><br/>Starring: Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel, Rufus Sewell, & Eddie Marsan <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for some sexuality and violence) <br/><br/>I had heard wonderful things about ""The Illusionist"" from all of my friends so I was very excited to get the chance to see it. With its great cast, it looked like one of the best movies of the year. But, I'll be honest; I've been so disappointed with many movies this year so I was a little hesitant. I am sick of being disappointed, but that seems to be what most Hollywood films do lately. So, I was very surprised when ""The Illusionist"" turned out to bewell, a beautiful and great movie that kept me thinking without completely losing me. It is a magical and deeply-involving film that is brought to life with vivid imagination and colorful direction, giving the film a surreal aura of mystery. This is what movies are supposed to be.<br/><br/>Edward Norton stars as Eisenheim, a talented magician who captivates the world with his magnificent illusions that are unlike anything anyone has seen before. When he was younger, he fell deeply in love with Sophie (Jessica Biel), a girl who is far above his social standing. The two were told that they can never be together and, for years, it seemed as though this were trueuntil Sophie happened to attend one of Eisenheim's performances. But, she is engaged to marry Crown Prince Leopoldand it seems as though there love is destined to be forgotten. But, Sophie still harbors much love for Eisenheim and Leopold reveals himself to be a greed-filled, power-hungry man who wants nothing but power. Eisenheim, desperate to be with Sophie, plans his greatest illusion yetone that will shock the entire city and make everyone question what they have seen.<br/><br/>Great performances fill ""The Illusionist"" with the highlight being, of course, Edward Norton. Norton does not overplay the part and, instead, does the complete opposite. He underplays it, lending to his character's mystery and intrigue. Jessica Biel makes for a beautiful and sympathetic love interest for Eisenheim. She shows that she is a versatile actress who can do more than just beat the crap out of a chainsaw-wielding maniac while wearing a wet, white tank top. Paul Giamatti, fresh off of the disaster that was ""Lady in the Water"", gives a solid performance here. Rufus Sewell is wonderfully villainous as Crown Prince Leopold. He gives a confident, fulfilling performance that I thought worked very well.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" is not a perfect film, however. I, personally, thought the plot twist was quite easy to figure out. I've never been one to brag about being able to guess endings to movies, because I don't typically know what is going to happen until it does. But, ""The Illusionist"" was different. I felt that everything was quite obviously leading up to the big twist. This isn't a horrible thing, but it lessened the ""big reveal"" for me. But, a predictable twist is hardly the worst thing that could happen to a movie. The remainder of ""The Illusionist"" more than makes up for it and makes the film a well-told, beautiful, and deeply magical story brought to life with brilliant direction and superb performances. If you haven't seen ""The Illusionist"", then you are doing yourself a grave disservice. It is a movie that everyone should be watching.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""The Illusionist"" is a brilliant film.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)"
"timhayes-1","8","1","1","13 April 2007"," Nothing is what it seems
","Maybe it is to the detriment of The Illusionist but I actually watched The Prestige first and found that film to be far more entertaining. That's not to say that this film is not entertaining by any means. I did enjoy it for what it is: a well made, period piece that keeps the viewer guessing until the final reveal. The film's plot is fairly straightforward. We begin with the arrest of Eisenheim (Edward Norton). The story then reverses telling what has transpired to bring us here. Finally, once it has caught up, the rest of the tale is told. Edward Norton is fine as Eisenheim and the ubiquitous Paul Giamatti turns in another great performance as his nemesis Chief Inspector Uhl. Jessica Biel is so-so as the lady caught in the middle, while Rufus Sewell turns in a you love to hate him performance as Crown Prince Rudolf. While The Illusionist is good, I found the complexities of The Prestige to make a far better film. The best part of this film is without a doubt, the superb score by Philip Glass. It rivals his work on Candyman as his his best film music to date."

","Both Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are impeccable, their roles fit perfectly their skills and personalities, moreover - and that's the surprise - Jessica Biel acts quite well.. ""The Illusionist"" is a haunting romance, framed in an enigma and set in turn of-the-century atmospheres. Finale is perhaps a bit predictable but conjures really get to mesmerize the viewers and storytelling as well as characters are inscrutable themselves, managing to overshadow the not great screen writing and the rudimentary direction. Norton and Biel should have shown more chemistry but everything is quite magical regardless, so I suggest everyone go to watch this film"
"chimera-4","7","1","1","5 April 2007"," Not bad at all...
","I'd heard a lot of bad press regarding this movie, much of it I suspect due to the movie being released around the same time as the superior ""The Prestige"". While clearly there are similarities between the two movies, and some pretty striking ones at that, it's possible to take each of them on their own merits as I feel they are different enough that they don't really compete with each other.<br/><br/>Both movies are essentially a love story at heart and both feature rival magicians (only touched on here as one of the characters happens to state that he's an amateur dabbler despite being a policeman)and some kind of twist at the end although to be honest with ""The Illusionist"" you can see it coming a mile off. That doesn't stop you from enjoying what is, in a sense, a very entertaining movie despite some shoddy acting and lazy directing.<br/><br/>I suspect much of the appeal and good things in this movie probably come from the novel it was based on and while there are a few scenes that do benefit from an understated sense of drama I think generally there were a lot of places where things could have been ramped up a bit. Particularly frustrating was how the death of a major character half way through was handled. Shockingly bad, no emotional context and off-screen to boot as well although to be fair there are some revelations at the end that do explain why things were handled this way although better directors could have done it more convincingly. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty sub-par in quite a few areas too. Some actors actually look and sound like they could nod off mid sentence. Most of the acting it has to be said is pretty monotonous and bland despite the presence of solid actors like Norton and Sewell. The only real performance of note was from Paul Giamatti who turned in a solid effort as the police inspector trying to unravel the mystery. It's good to see him get some real screen time as he's becoming a great character actor and it's a joy watching him work(give this guy more gigs).<br/><br/>Ultimately ""The Prestige"" IS a much better movie, being handled more professionally all round, probably had a bigger budget too but despite it's shortcomings there's a lot to recommend in ""The Illusionist"" and you could do a lot worse."
"ghugesujay","8","1","1","28 March 2007"," Stylishly crafted illusion that's definitely worth a look.
","Based on a short story by Pulitzer Prize winner Steven Millhauser, The Illusionist is a stylishly crafted film (illusion) with the right combination of romance, politics and supernatural mystery elegantly handled by writer-director Neil Burger. A periodic film, it features a stylish, charismatic and a strong performance by Edward Norton as the enigmatic magician who decides to risk everything for the sake of his love. Writer-director Neil Burger does a great job in keeping the story rolling along, and like with any good mystery story the clues are nicely planted along the route. The film is shot with a lovely, old world and an aged feel which helps enhance its strong sense of atmosphere. The on-stage magic tricks are nicely presented, but this movie relies less on the magical arts and more on a simple illusion. A magician's appeal rests not upon his tricks, but his bond with the audience. Those watching know they are being misled, that all they see is nothing but an illusion. But it is how the magician presents that sleight-of-hand that holds the crowd spellbound.<br/><br/>The Illusionist keeps you guessing and wondering right up until the end and like any good magic act, finishes with a satisfying flourish. A must-watch!!!"

This is one good piece of entertainment. Is it a ""morality"" tale? Barely. It's a romance and a crime mystery. It has political intrigue, good and bad guys, and plenty of tricks up its sleeves. You will NOT see the complexity as it builds, partly due to its not being available, but partly because it's slipped to you just a little at a time, and not in ways that calls attention to itself. Fortunately, the web of deceit is reviewed by a former foe at the end, and you'll enjoy slapping your forehead right along with him."
"schappe1","7","1","1","27 March 2007"," The original Illusionists
","I agree with those who have said that ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think ""The Prestige"" must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.<br/><br/>They are both well made and have interesting stories. The big difference is that ""The Illusionist"" is a romantic caper film and ""The Prestige"" is a dark examination of rivalry and revenge. The characters in the first are more likable and the story more palatable. I enjoyed the film more. The acting is a mixed bag: Edward Norton gives a performance that is restrained to the point of being flat. Jessica Biel is adequate. Rufus Sewell is fine and Paul Giamatti again dominates a good picture, although someone should tell him that the old theatrical scene-stealing technique of whispering your lines went out with Oliver Reed. Christian Bale dominates every scene with Hugh Jackman. He just has more gravitas. Michael Caine is Michael Caine, which is fine. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johanssen, which is OK.<br/><br/>What's interesting is the reaction of some fans that magic tricks that are the result of trick photography or CGI somehow are disappointing. The cinema did not evolve from the theater or from novels. It evolved from magic. Its predecessor was the ""magic lantern show"", which used some of the same concepts of projected images and the simulation of motion, was used first by magicians and not story-tellers. The works of Georges Méliès were those of a magician, not a novelist. If Eisenheim, Borden or Angier where here today, I think they'd all approve of the magic show these films represent. Then they'd probably become filmmakers themselves."

","A peasant boy grows up to become a great magician (Edward Norton). But his childhood love (Jessica Biel) is now betrothed to the crown prince (Rufus Sewell). Will the magician stand for this? Can any one man stand up against the royal family? Almost everyone I know loved this movie. Some were saying it was much better than ""The Prestige"", while others would point out the cinematography (which I must agree is very nice). I guess I didn't love it as much as many other people, but I freely accept it's a great film.<br/><br/>Jessica Biel was wonderful. Let me stress I don't expect much of her. Prior to this film, her best role was probably ""Rules of Attraction"", even though she was mostly just there to be a drunk college girl. Here she is much more and her acting is quite nuanced and refined. Almost the best of the movie.<br/><br/>The best, though, goes to Paul Giamatti, who seems to make everything he touches turn to gold. He couldn't save ""Lady in the Water"" (who could?) but he was no less awesome in it. And ""Sideways""? Wow! But here, he does a very low-key acting where he doesn't have a lot of range, but seems to make the small range even more dramatic than a character with large range. Compare Rufus Sewell (the crown prince) who is an overlooked actor and has good range here. Giamatti out-acts him, even though he does considerably less.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, always great, seems less than his best here. It's no ""Fight Club"" or ""American History X"". My friend who says that this film is better than ""The Prestige"" cites Norton as being better than Christian Bale. Maybe on his best days, but Norton here is nothing compared to Bale. Further, why I preferred the ""Prestige"" is that it seemed more realistic and plausible to me, whereas this relies on very different magic (and is done with poor CGI). I prefer a film where I can feel I'm supposed to accept the premises.<br/><br/>In all fairness, the two films are very different (aside from the magician thing) and shouldn't be compared. The Illusionist is a beautifully crafted film, with all the scenes framed perfectly, lit perfectly and given a texture that cannot easily be found elsewhere. If you don't watch it for a movie (even though you should) watch it for a piece of art. Really worth your time."
"jeuneidiot","7","1","1","24 March 2007"," Almost great, but something essential is missing
","This stylish story of deception and intrigue takes place in early 20th century Vienna. Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton) comes to town and stuns the crowds with his nearly--possibly supernatural magic tricks. Even the Crown Prince is intrigued. It so happens that the crown prince's fiancée Sophie (Jessica Biel) and Eisenheim were best of friends in childhood until her parents forbade her association with a commoner. When they become reacquainted, they spark an affair, which causes the prince to kill Sophie in a drunken rage. Eisenheim knows the prince did it and tries to subtly have him accused. The prince won't have any of this an orders his faithful, but just, chief Inspector (Paul Giamati) to shut down Eisenheim.<br/><br/>The director maintains a mysterious and dark mood throughout the movie in this well-paced period piece. The actors do justice to their role and the story draws one in. The ending, which is meant to be surprising, can be guessed at by the savvy viewer who has developed her skills watching Buffy, Veronica Mars and Lost. I enjoyed the movie, and would possibly watch it again, but it wouldn't hold up to multiple viewings as well as some.<br/><br/>This movie is like a blue peanut M&M with only a half a peanut inside. The crisp candy shell gives way to a less sweet chocolate (Mars Inc. took months to perfect the chocolate, making it less sweet, hence less satisfying, thus increasing consumption). When you realize the peanut is minuscule, you experience a slight disappointment, although an M&M with only half a peanut is better than a plain M&M which is better than celery any day. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"
"paulcreeden","9","1","1","18 March 2007"," Intelligent suspense.
","This wonderful story is brought to life by a very good cast. The story itself is loosely based in the real-life mystery of Crown Prince Rudolf's suicide, which rocked the Austrian Hapsburgs in 1889. He was thirty-one. His suicide followed the violent death of his female lover, Baroness Vetsera. There is ongoing debate as to whether he murdered her and then committed suicide, or whether they were engaged in a suicide pact, in response to an edict from Rudolph's father, Franz Josef, the Austrian Emporer. It has been called the Mayerling Affair, named for the hunting lodge where the couple had their assignations. The use of real history and its reshaping into an engaging mystery which parallels the real mystery is what is ingenious about the script. Edward Norton is excellent. Perhaps the taciturn nature of his character enhanced his performance. Jessica Biel is also very good as the Countess. Paul Giamatti puts in another great performance as the police inspector. The only thing that bothered me was the sepia palette of the film. While it contributed to the credibility of the illusions, it was a bit too brown and dark at times, when contrasted to the scenes which were brightly lighted. A minor complaint. The sets were delightful. I could feel the heat from the real gas lights. Overall, this is one of the best period mystery-suspense films I have seen."

","One of the best movies I have seen in recent years. I went to see it mostly because I like the art of illusion and I have a 12 year old son who is learning card tricks. I ended up totally immersed in the film. Great and intriguing story, romantic but never cheesy, that ends on a totally unexpected twist. Fantastic performance from Giamatti and Norton, as for Biel, well, she is beautiful. It is also artistically filmed, very atmospheric, with good dialogues and sense of humour. Reading a few negative critics, some people seems to complain about the unrealistic nature of the illusions. It seems that they have never watched illusionists like David Copperfield or Darren Brown. I was in Courchevel three weeks ago and in our hotel we had a magician who everyday was performing excellent tricks and was making things disappear right in front of you. I didn't complaint because I couldn't understand how he was doing it! But I guess it's a genre you like or you don't. I watched the movie with my wife who loved it and her sister who didn't like it at all, and usually they always agree! Anyway, I highly recommend it."

","The plot line here is simple enough. An adolescent romance is forcibly interrupted because of class differences between the boy (a commoner) and the girl (a duchess). Years later, they by chance reconnect, and the boy, now a man, is determined to overcome that pesky detail of class difference, and win back the love of his life. Around this simple core is woven a beautiful tapestry of beautiful cinematography, and a well acted tale that reaches into the realm, at times, of the hard-to-believe. The male of the romantic pair is a renowned illusionist/clairvoyant billed as ""Eisenheim,"" who successfully awes late 19th Century Vienna with his masterful illusions. His love interest happens to be a Duchess who is unhappily engaged to the rather self absorbed Crown Prince. How can he free the unhappy Duchess, and reclaim her for his own? This is where his skill in illusion really pays off, and for us, challenges our sense of the believable. However, I found that I really wasn't too concerned about how incredibly the plot came to resolution (I am deliberately trying to avoid spoilers here); I am a sucker for a good romance, and I felt sympathetic to the impassioned pair, so I went with it...and enjoyed it very much, lack of realism notwithstanding."

Writer/Director Neil Burger makes a movie here that is truly a masterpiece, and the producers from the Yari co. (Crash and Sideways) show that they produce movies of good quality. No. Make it great quality.<br/><br/>Here we see Edward Norton playing Eisenheim the Illusionist. A magician whom people crowd into theaters just to watch him. He learns his tricks from an old traveling magician whom he meets one day when he was in his teens. He uses these tricks in the street where he meets the duchess Sophie (Biel) and the two fall into a forbidden love. They are soon separated and never see each other again for a long time. Eisenheim travels around the world and grows up using his tricks to gain money to help the poor. In one performance in which the Crown Prince Leopold (the vicious Rufus Sewell) attends. In one trick he asks for a volunteer. A woman comes up and stuns Eisenheim's eyes to see it is Sophie. He finds out that she is to marry Leopold and the two fall in a forbidden love again while Leopold becomes obsessed with making Eisenheim a fraud to the people and charges Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to find and expose the truth.<br/><br/>The Illusionist is a well directed and filmed movie that is surely one of the best films of 2006.

","After seeing such a disappointing piece of garbage like 'The Black Dahlia' last night, I was really praying that the next film I'd see this weekend would be better. Towards the beginning of the film I had my doubts due to it's semi-lagging pace, but once it sped-up and ended, I realized I just saw one of the best films of the year, thus far. 'The Illusionist' is not only a compelling and very well made motion picture, it's a throughly enjoyable one as well.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, after taking a huge break, comes back to film as Eisenheim, a very famous and mysterious magician in turn-of-the-century Vienna. Eisenheim is a very articulate magician who is anything but arrogant. After impressing pretty much every citizen in Vienna including a bumbling police inspector played by Paul Giamatti, the prince of Vienna played by Dark City's Rufus Sewell comes to one of Eisenheim's shows. It is there where Eisenheim lays his eyes on the Prince's soon to be wife, Sophie (Jessica Biel), whom he had fallen in love with ten to twenty years prior. That's about all I'll tell you about the plot of 'The Illusionist', in fear I may give something away. It's a film that should be experienced without a lot of prior knowledge about the plot. Just remember it's a period piece about a magician.<br/><br/>'The Illusionist', the second film by Neil Burger, is a masterfully crafted film. Although it has it's flaws like being poorly paced at the beginning and a little bit towards the middle, the film captivates it's audiences once it starts going and doesn't let go. Burger's directing is well-done, but it's his writing that one should admire the most out of the two. The film is filled with first-rate performances all around, which one could argue is the strongest aspect of it. Edward Norton delivers yet another incredible performance as Eisenheim. He makes the character his own bringing this strange sense of warmness to Eisenheim I feel couldn't have been done by many other actors. Paul Giamatti is marvelous as well in a role he usually doesn't play, which is perfectly showcased by his performance in the ending sequence. Norton and Giamatti play off each other perfectly, not too much of a surprise seeing as though the two highly- gifted actors were roommates in College. Even though Norton and Giamatti steal pretty much every scene there is in the movie, Jessica Biel is quite good in her role. She actually makes me believe for the first time in her career that she could be labeled a ""very good actress"". Sewell is great in his limited role as the mean-spirited prince and British actor Eddie Marsan (21 Grams, Gangs of New York, Vera Drake) is solid in a small part as Eisenheim's manager.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'The Illusionist' a great little surprise this fall that will satisfy most of it's viewers. I highly recommend it based on the stellar performances and smooth script alone. Grade: B+ (screened at Harkins Arizona Mills 24, Tempe, Arizona, 9/16/06)"

However, compared to the dramatic hold and thematic bravado which distinguishes THE PRESTIGE, the stately film feels somewhat conventional: in fact, while I was expecting something on the lines of Ingmar Bergman's THE FACE (1958)  with a government official exposing a magician as a fraud and the latter's deadly retribution  all it ultimately amounted to was another impossible/undying love type of story; the final twist, however, is worth waiting for. Edward Norton gave his usual thorough performance, Jessica Biel was radiant as the romantic interest and Rufus Sewell rather monotonous as the crossed Prince  but it's Paul Giamatti who steals the film as the conflicted Police Inspector."

","***refer to above for THE WORST EDWARD NORTON QUOTE EVER!!!***<br/><br/>This movie, as most of the WORLD thought, was good. not great, not FABULOUS, not terrible, not disgusting....just...good. The twist was...unexpected for the most part (if you're really paying attention you can probably GUESS the end.) But it was a good twist. Edward Norton's facial hair was in a word...DISTURBING... and given Jessica Biel's previous attempts at acting (refer to BLADE 3) she did VERY well and she managed to keep a BETTER ACCENT then the NORTON did. The way the film just jumped into the plot right from the get go was great. It makes the viewers wonder ""what the hell just happened?"" (BUT in a good way!!) Paul Giamatti totally OWNED Edward Norton! He completely stole the show right out from under his nose. Which was very refreshing after watching him in ""Lady in the Water"".<br/><br/>P.S.

"sabre_xyz","8","1","1","24 January 2007"," Excellent movie but for the lead casting
","One of the few movies of 2006 that is, in my humble opinion, worth watching. Viewers instantly empathize with the young Eisenheim, who loves a girl beyond his social status. My only complaint is with the casting of the 2 leads - both Norton and Biel are not the best choices to play Victorian characters.<br/><br/>Norton's youthful voice fails to convey the melancholy and gravitas one would expect from Eisenheim. After all the teen shows and movies, Biel seems too lightweight to play Sophie's role. Their English accents were beyond laughable.<br/><br/>The rest of the casting is stellar - Giamatti is superb as the inspector, as is Sewell as the crown prince. The background music is excellent and so is the soft lit cinematography. Kudos to a well written screenplay that mostly keeps you engaged."

The reveal of the final twist was absolutely astoundingly well done. Please see this film, it is one of the most original and well done films of the past year.

Everything flows well together and there doesn't feel like anything was overdone. For a movie that has many different threads all flowing they tie them all together very well and never let anyone get to far ahead of the other. The music also is well done and helps deliver the movie very well. The actors also help the movie as they all play they parts very well right to the very end.

Perhaps if they made the young Ed Norton's character a little older, one could have believed that she would have left everything she had for a childhood love. As it was, it seemed that she was too quick to denounce her upbringing for a man that had left her when they were, what, 12? In any event, maybe it was the wine, but I catch them ALL, and I didn't see this one coming even though it was stolen directly from ""The Usual Suspects."" I'm a little mad at myself for that."

"nycritic","8","1","1","3 December 2006"," The Art of Deceit
","A young man of poor origins only known as Eisenheim sits alone in an empty stage, looking blankly ahead at a waiting crowd of which two people stand out: a bespectacled young man and an older gentleman. Both men seem to be observing this moment of silence with supreme anticipation. Almost like angel dust, Eisenheim conjured a ghostly mass that flutters to the right of him and begins to manifest something that causes a massive commotion.<br/><br/>Because Neil Berger's movie THE ILLUSIONIST begins in media res, most of what happens takes place in progressive flashbacks that slowly disclose the beginnings of a passion between two star-crossed childhood lovers. The young boy Eisenheim had become the close friend of the nobly-born Sophie von Teschen at about the same time he had had his first encounter with a wise man who had taught him the secret of disappearance. Due to their social imbalance Eisenheim and Sophie had become separated. Eisenheim then decided to travel the world, but once back in Austria as a young man (the introspective Edward Norton), he was intent of reconnecting with Sophie (Jessica Biel, redeeming herself from London) -- even though she was now engaged to be married to the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), a marriage clearly borne out of social conventions. His reputation as an ""illusionist"" begins to take hold, causing an increasing unrest, setting off an investigation initiated by Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who also comes from a humble background but desires a high social status. Tensions escalate as Eisenheim's presence and ability to fall on his feet reaches a breaking point... and causes the disappearance of Sophie. Working to unravel her assassin, Eisenheim takes the ultimate risk in trying to conduct a séance session -- that takes the story back to the beginning scene as Uhl and Leopold look on in anticipation. His success in materializing Sophie and having her point the finger on her murderer will be the turning point in this clever story of the ultimate deceit.<br/><br/>Neil Berger has made quite a movie. While the trailer hinted at a lot of action and adventure, this is, like the ""orange tree"" which slowly reveals its fruit, a very tricky unfolding of cinematic tricks that takes its time to reach the final push before the cliff. The way it gets there teeters between the detectivesque and the unconventional, a subtle reference to Agatha Christie stories in which all is not what it seems and sometimes people who are caught under the sign of ""underprivileged"" must do ""tricks"" to retain a little of the pie. An enjoyable ride."
"refresh_daemon","7","1","1","26 September 2006"," Enjoyable and entertaining fare
","I'm going to keep the review of this film short. Basically, this film is a good mystery film. The performances range from adequate to excellent (predictably). The directing is perfectly invisible, minus some montagery (this is a good thing for this sort of film) and subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) highlights the emotions and tensions present in the film.<br/><br/>There is some tricky writing going on, however, it's not too difficult to guess the plot if you're well read in films or mystery-dramas. And the combination of all these leads to enjoyable and entertaining fare. It's not much more than that, but I don't think it's trying to be.<br/><br/>The only criticism I can really level against the film is that, as a mystery film, things are only partially explained in the end. In particular, the whole aspect of the film regarding illusion and magic isn't adequately explained and I can understand why the writer/director didn't want to fully explain it, because it does take away from the magic, but the genre that the film is in dictates that it must be at least explained adequately. If it's magic, tell me so. If it's trickery, show me so. But some of what happens in the movie continues to be unexplained, although to some degree, some explanations are hinted at.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, that's the only real criticism I have of the film. It didn't particularly impress or connect with me, but that doesn't make it any less of a worthy effort. You wouldn't go wrong by watching this one. 7/10."
"Danusha_Goska","7","1","1","23 September 2006"," A Little Hocus Pocus mit Your Strudel?
","""The Illusionist"" is a fun bit of mitteleuropa fluff. There's lots of pretty sets from the Czech Republic, both architecture and pastoral scenes.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti as a police officer gives us yet another masterful performance. He was convincing as a drunk in ""Sideways,"" as a boxing manager in ""Cinderella Man,"" and he's convincing here as a Viennese cop from a common background trying to reach the top of society by carrying out the will of the powerful but not destroying a magician for whom he feels some sympathy.<br/><br/>Jessica Biel is really lovely as an aristocrat torn between family duty and true love. Unlike too many other actresses her age, Biel really convinces that she is of another era. There is nothing of the jarringly anachronistic twenty-first century mall rat, valley girl, or post-feminist about her performance. She fills out her lush costumes with both her body and her soul.<br/><br/>Rufus Sewell is so good as the evil Crown Prince Leopold that I wish that there were a slew of Hapsburg movies in the pipe so we could boo and hiss him again and again. Let's make a movie version of ""Janosik"" or ""Good Soldier Svejk"" or remake ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" just to keep Rufus Sewell in that costume, toting that sword, screaming those lines.<br/><br/>Ed Norton has his champions; I don't get it. I think he's fine, of course, but I'm not all gaga about him the way some are. He's good here as a magician / lover / trickster, but he didn't take my breath away.<br/><br/>Philip Glass' score was fun, in places, in that it reflected mitteleuropean music, but there weren't enough over the top moments, and mitteleuropean music is all about going over the top, in terms of technical aspects like tempo and emotional aspects like schmaltz. Also, one wishes that Glass had made use of instruments other than violins and the occasional flute. A cimbolom, for example, a zither, or a Slovak fujara. The score for ""The Third Man"" has not been bested as the most memorable mitteleuropean-influenced film score.<br/><br/>The story, of Eisenheim, a magician who bests the world around him through his wits, is reminiscent of Jewish folktales in which a very clever Jewish man outwits his better-armed, Gentile opponents. The movie doesn't make much of these cultural resonances.<br/><br/>Also, I wonder about ""Eisenheim""'s similarity to ""Einstein."" In one of his onstage tricks, Eisenheim creates the illusion of an orange tree growing from seed to maturity in a few moments. He introduces this trick by talking about the relativity of time, which, of course, brings Einstein to mind. Again, the movie does not dwell on this.<br/><br/>As much as I liked this movie, I wish it had been richer. The real mitteleuropean world it depicts is a busy, lively, crowded, warm, complex one; I wish some of that had made its way onto the screen. The movie is slow, and not the good kind of slow. Its slowness could have been livened up with more on screen -- why not give Giamatti a peasant lover in embroidered aprons who could provide some depth to scenes that consist, only, of Giamatti staring ahead, looking dumbfounded, as he tries to figure something out? Otherwise, though, ""The Illusionist"" is a fun and pleasant movie."
"wigowsky","10","1","1","24 September 2006"," Magical, mysterious, miraculous mosaic of the magician's art.
","I was absolutely amazed by the storyline and the dramatic presentation of the magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton). When the young magician initially tries to perform a ""disappearing act"" and fails, I was disappointed. However, when the magician goes ""east"" and studies the magical art and then returns to Vienna to perform ""a convincing disappearing act"" in public, I wondered who taught him and how he performed the act. The ""disappearing act"" throughout the history of magic has been associated with the esoteric knowledge of ""dematerialization."" The artistic renderings of the magician's art of ""disappearance or dematerialization"" in the movie reminded me of the story of the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana (a neo-Pythagorian), who magically disappeared from the court of the Roman Emperor Domitian in the first century C.E. In the case of Apollonius, in contrast to the illusionist Eisenheim, the disappearance was not an illusion. Unless we accept the idea that all matter is illusory, and the transformation of matter to energy is part of that ""illusion."""

It would have been nice to know what happen to Paul Giamati's character, a good man caught in politics, but maybe that was the point.

Edward Norton continues to demonstrate a talent normally associated with only a few exceptionally great actors on the order of Olivier and Orson Welles.

","Based on Steven Millhauser's short story, Eisenheim the Illusionist, this beautifully shot period piece is fairly hokey and completely predictable. That said, I still had a lot of fun watching it come together.<br/><br/>It's a typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back story with Edward Norton as Eisenheim, a sleight of hand artist, who falls for the wrong dame, Sophie (Jessica Beal sporting some big choppers and a nice plump heinie in the final shot). She's an aristocrat, way out of his poor boy league. The two are separated by the powers that be, only to be reunited years later when Eisenheim becomes the toast of Vienna and Sophie attends one of his gigs with her almost fiancé Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell doing the darndest Jude-Law-with-ridiculous-mustache impersonation I've ever seen). Also on the scene is Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector Uhl. He's doing his best to maintain law and order while also favoring the Crown Prince in hopes of political advancement.<br/><br/>There's lots of intrigue with more than enough special effects to go around. Luckily, Eisenheim's illusions are all flash bang wowzer stuff. It's subtle and keeps the story from lurching into something too big for its britches. This is a little film and, rightly, the tricks are small as well. I enjoyed the old time look of the film (the center of the picture is very clear while the edges seem soft and there is a distinct flicker to some flashback scenes) and was able to overlook the odd ""we're in a foreign country so let's all have English accents"" staple."

","Jessica Biehl is one of the most beautiful actresses working today. She has a fine healthy physique, long gorgeous blonde hair, medium sized pouty lips and seductive eyes that pull you in dry the manhood out of you. I didn't know what to expect from her in a period piece, I didn't know what to expect of this film. I had heard it was good, but you can never really trust reviews. But I can now lay my fears to rest. Both are good. Jessica Biehl shows her versatility as an actress while portraying the object of two man's separate desires one for love, the other for possession. Her performance is immediate and plausible. The film itself is good, not great. It presents a layered storyline setup as an illusionists magic trick. As the film moves along we are introduced to plot twists, character revelations, none of which are too surprising. But still confident and skillfully executed. Biehl and Nortons chemistry is so-so. But solo they both do quite well in the film. The love story isn't as involving as the film makers would like it to be. But the suspense is. The film is well done, shot beautifully with wonderful costumes and good performances. The direction is confident without being smarmy but isn't very inventive either. The films pacing is a bit long but never dull. In the end the film is a solid good effort for all involved but despite Jessica Biehl's surprisingly confident turn the film is like one of it's characters magic tricks. Plausible when your watching but ultimately it's nothing more than a disappearing act. A little more involvement on the character level would have made it much more memorable."
"ruby_fff","8","1","1","4 September 2006"," Edward Norton is intensely persuasive, and the whole film is captivating, plot in suspension - ever the 'mindbending' reservation of truth or illusion
","""The Illusionist"" is a treat of a period costume drama which we've not seen much lately in cinema (""Age of Innocence"" and ""Somewhere In Time"" came to mind). Hollywood is not short of epic period movies with action/battle scenes. Here, it's a different kind of battle - one of the mind - an almost 'whodunit' plot line weave in with romantic love story and 'mindbending' magic. A remarkable feature film formidably delivered by writer-director Neil Burger, with supportive producers who are just as passionate about the production of this film. The magic is not of the 'usual' kind employing mere tricks to the eye - it is more perceptual and hypnotic.<br/><br/>Impressed by Edward Norton's performances ever since his chilling antagonist role in ""Primal Fear"" 1996 opposite Richard Gere, and in ""American History X"" 1998, he practically outdone himself. Following ""Fight Club,"" he made his directorial debut ""Keeping the Faith"" 2000, taking a break from his intense roles and having fun acting with Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman in the delightful romantic comedy. With Julie Taymor's ""Frida"" and Spike Lee's ""25th Hour,"" he's such a skillful actor that there's no disappointment ever. In ""The Illusionist,"" his focused intensity is mesmerizing and sure grabbed audience, on screen and in cinema, alike. He would make a person disappear in front of your eyes. Will he make himself disappear, too? The question did cross my mind for an instance. The involving story (a magician, a countess, an inspector and a prince at the turn of the century Vienna) continues to be evolving, as we follow Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl - we are caught up with his questions and suspicion, and the challenge from the Prince's skepticism on hoax magician and his ambition to 'modernize' the monarchy.<br/><br/>Everything about ""The Illusionist"" is superior: the re-creation of the period (in Prague and Tábor of the Czech Republic), the interior and exterior locales (castles/fields, theaters/city streets), the costumes (aristocrats/commoners), armory (swords/pistols), equestrian/carriage details, set decoration, production design. Cinematography by Dick Pope (who worked on many Mike Leigh's films); music by Philip Glass (can't be more befitting); of course, adapted screenplay and direction by Neil Burger. The cast is impeccable: besides Norton, Giamatti took on a mustache and beard (well, they all do), and a different tone to his voice to become Chief Inspector Uhl - turning in another convincing performance. Rufus Sewell (""Dark City,"" ""Dangerous Beauty"" 1998) as the Crown Prince Leopold, he certainly is - his demeanor and that 'unbesmirchable' arrogance, indeed. Jessica Biel (in Rob Cohen's ""Stealth"" 2005, boldly right up there next to Josh Lucas and Jamie Foxx) as the serene beauty of Countess Sophie, yet the inner strength exudes for a turn of the century woman. Her scenes with Norton (first time we get to see him with a quiet intimate side) are wonderfully captured.<br/><br/>Yes, truth or illusion? ""What you see is illusion."" Do you believe that? There is suspense and mystery and not until the end - well, could Uhl's deduction be reality? We want it to be true. Whatever it is, ""The Illusionist"" is a masterful film, enjoyable at best. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>(The teaser trailer of w-d (""Memento,"" ""Batman Begins"") Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" for fall release has an impressive cast with Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson - an alluring film about magicians and the mystery of their tricks?)"

Norton runs off on a quest to discover magic and, in his thirties, returns to Vienna where he almost immediately crosses path with Biel, her jealous and homicidal fiancé (Sewell) and the affable but cynical Inspector under Sewell's thumb (Giamatti). Norton's Magic is so astonishing that nobody can discern how he does it, and eventually, it becomes apparent that the real mystery is not the identity of the murderer, but the methods of the illusionist.<br/><br/>The film is clever and manipulative, and does a pretty good job of distracting its audience from the the very question which actually drives the plot.

","It only seemed a matter of time before the genre of magic, specifically in an era outside of our own, was seized by Hollywood hands with ""The Illusionist"" and soon ""Batman Begins"" director Christopher Nolan's upcoming ""The Prestige."" With CGI to make magic seem even more eerily believable, what audience doesn't love magic? ""Illiusionist"" takes advantage of this fact, mesmerizing the audience and intriguing them with the thought that the illusions might actually be possible. The problem is that the film sometimes lets this get in the way with the real human element of the film, the love story, which is supposed to be the most important part.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's character Eisenheim the Illusionist is merely a talented magician who after many years encounters his childhood sweetheart, Sophie (Jessica Biel), a girl of the upper class with which Eisenhiem is unfortunately not affiliated. The problem is that Sophie is nearly engaged to the Crown Prince of Vienna (Rufus Sewell). The Crown Prince's interest in magic reunites the two, who fall back in love. When Eisenheim sacrifices some of the prince's dignity for the sake of his magic, the prince requests that Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) do what he must to bring Eisenheim down. The two lovers then find themselves in a situation bound to tear them apart.<br/><br/>Love, therefore, becomes the motivation for nearly all Norton's actions, but we see the plot instead being driven by the film's other conflicts, namely Giamatti's character's internal conflict between his allegiance to the prince and the truth. He seems to take over the protagonists role at a point during the film. We also get to see very little of the romance that drives the film aside from a couple of scenes that this motivation gets blurred. <br/><br/>While these other elements that distract are entertaining and meaningful, the story's ability to grab the viewer's heartstrings is muffled. It's all very interesting from the illusions themselves to the mystery at hand, but the extra step needed for the film to flourish is a true grasp of the love story. You'll be intrigued and entertained, which is sometimes all you need, but the film cheats itself out of the opportunity to be a real sleeper."

","This was really an incredibly lovely movie visually and the acting was excellent. The story was unusual and well worth the wait for the ending. A huge surprise. Edward Norton is such a versatile actor; as is Paul Giametti. They work well together on the screen, as does the woman who plays Norton's love interest. The only thing that bothered me (sorry) was the really awful mustache that the ""mean"" character wore. Silly observation, but distracting. Looked like it was stuck on and ready to fall off. Norton is really superb; his melancholy character played so very well. Edward Norton never over-acts. He just plays the character in his movies so convincingly. And Paul Giametti does himself proud as the inspector who asks too many questions. The scenery is well-done and you get the feel for the time period. You also feel the eeriness in the theatre where Norton performs. Highly recommend the film; best seen on the big screen."

There was no passion or spark between Biel and Norton and I didn't feel anything real about their relationship. The villain was pretty good, evil without overacting. There weren't too many other characters involved so it was more like a stage play, and there was a great deal of action. The effects were not great.

","So last summer we saw two magic movies, The Prestige and The Illusionist. Both of these movies stunk, but The Prestige is the winner IMO for a couple of reasons, but here is why both movies are pretty much garbage: 1) The Illusionist makes absolutely no attempt to explain how Norton's character performs his magic. So we are left to wonder how a man can make spirits or something similar appear. The answer is, he can't. Since the director doesn't want to show us how Norton performs his tricks we are left to figure it out ourselves and since it is not plausible or possible, it makes what Norton does ridiculous.<br/><br/>2) The Prestige attempts to explains it's ""magic"", but it's magic is actually sci-fi garbage that makes no sense as well. Tesla can create machines that duplicate objects now can he? Both movies are extremely implausible, but at least The Prestige attempts to explain it's tricks, even though they break the rules the film maker sets for us in the first half of the film. Stay away from both movies as they will only leave you scratching your head when the credits roll."

And the bad guy (the prince) is really caricatural .. Booohooo he is such a bad guy!

","Though it was better than most movies I've PPV'd lately, it was overly-written, and you could see where it was going a bazillion miles away while driving a truck through the plot holes. If Leopold, Kronprinz von Österreich-Ungarn (that's more High German than is in the film) has immunity from prosecution for any crime as long as the crime is committed on Imperial Property (which sounds more than a bit loopy), then why does he blow his brains out? I would have shot Uhl, then told the police that he had confessed to killing Sophie as part of a plot to overthrow the Imperial Family (or some such nonsense), and that I had just dispensed justice (or some such nonsense).<br/><br/>Why does Junior need Sophie, an Austrian, to win over the Hungarians? If he has killed before, then why the sudden uproar over the ""demise"" of the stiff-as-a-board Sophie (especially as played by the stiff-as-a-board Biel)? And why does Junior want to overthrow Daddy when he's next in line? Makes sense to me, too!<br/><br/>I was bothered by how Junior's guests openly mocked him. That, kids, is treason, and, in the real world, they would have been dragged out of the palace by their snooty heels, and shot!<br/><br/>The film is as gorgeous as the leads are lame. Norton, Biel, Giamatti and Sewell speak with some quasi-British accent, while the supporting cast sound like refugees from an Aussie stock company.

"Aristides-2","3","4","9","4 February 2007"," Silent Movie look alike
","Yes, the movement (see Editing)reminded me of a silent film (it may be that I've been educated visually by the extraordinary evolvement of movie editing over the years and have become unconsciously intolerant of this kind of editing).<br/><br/>There are 344 reviews of this movie and while I have but read a sampling; some raves and some pans, I must say that the negative reviews are some of the best I've read at IMDb (usually people, both pro and con, deal exclusively with emotional reactions to a movie; nothing wrong with that by the way.) So with the above in mind I will not repeat the major objections most people had but will report a few odds-and-ends that I didn't see commented on. Again, I thought the negative reviews were spot on.<br/><br/>1) Style of editing, mentioned above, was so slow that I remarked to my wife that whole feature films could have safely passed through the straits between scenes.<br/><br/>2) A weakness or too sometimes shown by inexperienced feature film directors: The costumes, vehicles, interior furnishings were squeaky clean. As a retired film technician I've seen this happen plenty of times first hand. Filmmakers, prop people, set people get overly concerned with the things they rent and are timid about, well, dirtying them for instance. Was Vienna of the late 19th Century that clean? I don't think so. Did every passerby as well as more featured characters always have supremely clean and pressed clothes/uniforms; I think not.<br/><br/>3) The cinematography was way too beautiful. It's a boy-meets-girl, boy-loses girl, etc. story and one didn't need to bashed over the head with the visual lushness. Restraint, restraint, restraint.<br/><br/>4) Penn and Teller and David Copperfield, to mention just two contemporary magicians, are able to visually do amazing things that are perfect illusions. I couldn't buy into some of the illusions Eisenheim performed on stage. Yes, suspension of disbelief as far as one is able to do it counts for something but I couldn't cede this because of the sophistication of some of the illusions placed in the contest of where stage magic was at the time.<br/><br/>Another final extension of 4): I find that many horror films and films like ""The Illusionist"" are faith-based. To me, they are essentially asking for the viewer to become believers. If a religious movie is directly showing miracles, for instance, then you sub-consciously accept or not-accept it based on your own belief system, either religious or secular. ""The Illusionist's"" illusions tap into the supernaturalism of religious belief and even the hideous *""explain all"" ending confuses one when taking this tack. Inspector Uhl remembers the things that fooled him but doesn't think about something like how butterflies could be conjured that actually carry three a three dimensional object into the audience. *Hitchcock's brilliant ""Psycho"" also has an ending that almost screws up an otherwise perfect film; a psychiatrist ""explains"" why Norman Bates did what he did."
"tomq5p","5","3","6","25 September 2006"," Good acting and cinematography cannot save a weak plot and script
","I really wanted to like this film but I simply couldn't. I predicted the ending as soon as it was possible to do so. Eisenheim (the Illusionist) didn't fool me, and he probably won't fool the moderately shrewd moviegoer either. The film didn't tie up a variety of loose ends and the plot was all over the place. The script was average at best. In fact, some of the dialogue struck me as not being accurate to the period being portrayed in the movie. All of the other aspects, however, of the period portrayal were excellent. The cinematography was impressive and contributed to the feel of the movie, which did a great job of placing the viewer in moment. Unfortunately, the plot was too weak to hold the movie together and there are many questions left unanswered. Some might argue that the film is supposed to leave the viewer asking questions. I, however, thought that is was more a result of sloppy film-making and a plot with several gaping holes. The opening scene didn't even match itself when it was shown again toward the end of the film. Everything was there except a solid plot or mystery. I have a feeling that ""The Prestige"" will do a much better job with virtually the same concept. <br/><br/>5 out of 10"

"Michael-70","3","6","18","10 September 2006"," Why Must Innocent People Pay For The Hero's Love Life? It's Unconscionable!
","Ultimately I disliked this film because I felt queasy about the single-minded quest of our illusionist hero Eisenheim played by Edward Norton to muscle in on the romantic affairs of the Crown Prince Leopold. Presumably with a childlike taunt of ""I saw her first"", Eisenheim feels that he has the right to have Jessica Biel for himself even though she is betrothed to the Crown Prince. Taking his cue from other amoral, selfish types who think their own desires are the only ones that need fulfilling, when Eisenheim is finished, we have an innocent man in jail for murder (who will presumably stay there) and the suicide of another man who is made to think he killed someone who is actually still alive. <br/><br/>All of this is perpetrated so Norton and Biel can go off together and live happily ever after. Why did so many innocent people have to suffer for their love? Couldn't they have just eloped or run away? I actually heard people in the audience cheer and applaud when the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) shot himself. Suicide should not be laughed at in this manner. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm old fashioned that way, but whatever the Crown Prince's crimes, they were not worth a bullet in the head. It is not OK to trick the Crown Prince simply because he is alleged to have beaten up his girlfriends from time to time. Key word there is ""alleged"", we never actually see him do anything violent, even if he is a bit of a jerk. Sadly, being a jerk is not against the law or our prisons would have long since been over filled.<br/><br/>There are other unbelievable things in this story; for example, it was only fifteen years since the heroine played by Jessica Biel laid eyes on her childhood friend Eisenheim, so it is not believable that she did not recognize him at all when she saw him again as an adult. I mean, she kept a picture of him in a secret locket that she no doubt looked at from time to time, but she couldn't recognize him when she finally saw him? She couldn't figure out who this guy is right away? How many sleight of hand masters does she know?<br/><br/>Plus, how much did he really love her if he couldn't wait to run away for fifteen years in the first place? Now all of a sudden he thinks he can't live without her? Also, wet rope makes more sparks than the chemistry between Norton and Biel, even though both are good actors.<br/><br/>Consider what actually happens in this film: Ed Norton's Illusionist breaks up a prosperous and seemingly OK engagement (what couple doesn't have occasional fights?). He has a man put in jail on false murder charges and forces another man to kill himself, all to satisfy his romantic jones. How long were they going to let the poor innocent man rot in jail for the murder of Jessica Biel's character before mentioning that ""Oh by the way""; she's not dead and he's in jail on false pretenses? This is unconscionable in every way. <br/><br/>Wisely, the filmmakers never show us the poor sap who was jailed for Jessica Biel's alleged murder. I can only presume that he is not having a good time. If we in the audience ever connected the poor fellow to someone with a life and a family, we would not be so sanguine that Norton and Biel find their happiness at his expense. Now, with the Crown Prince dead, and Biel gone, will Paul Giamatti's police chief finally realize and admit he screwed up the case and release the innocent man? I doubt it.<br/><br/>Also, the ""Sixth Sense"" like ending where every thing is explained is a bit clumsy and Giamatti should have already figured it all out anyway. Other wise, the film has a power, I could not take my eyes off the screen despite the fact that no sparks fly between Norton and Biel at all. The magic scenes were interesting, but not so compelling as they would be in a live stage performance. I know how they do tricks in movies; I don't know how magicians do it on a live stage. Phillip Glass's score is only ordinary; I had hoped for more. But that's obviously a paradox; more from a minimalist."
"bronson96","2","3","7","26 July 2007"," I was surprised after the great reviews
","A surprise disappointment. I like both Norton and Giamatti, but this movie did neither of them credit. I've heard this was the director's first movie and I would think it likely; it looks like period T.V., not period cinema; I don't know where complements on the cinematography come from. Many shots had boring/distracting lighting or were flatly/statically framed. There are irritating old-fashioned style credits before the movie and an annoyingly narrated flashback. I'll give everyone involved some credit as there were a few moments I found chilling and I didn't see their particular twist coming, but it wasn't enough to elevate the movie. The ending smacks of studio interference; the ""big secrets"" were implausibly explained in a single epiphanous moment, while every interesting mystery was just dropped. Plot wouldn't have interfered with a better movie, but doesn't redeem this here. Biel and Norton didn't create the kind of heat that would make this a successful romance over a background of illusion, plus their primary motivating relationship is never persuasive. It gets a star for contemporary production values and another for being just interesting enough to finish it. If you are engrossed by the atmosphere you might be amused, otherwise this movie will probably disappoint."
"Chris Knipp","6","3","7","19 August 2006"," Smoke and mirrors, unsexy romance; pretty scenes
","The Illusionist, NYTimes film critic Stephen Holden says, ""rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous."" Maybe. Its grandly staged magic shows in nineteenth-century costume are very pretty. But this fairy tale for adults with its suspenseful but simplistic plot and its feeble finale has you just plain slumbering at times too. To call it ""the miraculous"" is glorifying what Eisenheim the Illusionist does -- just super-good magic tricks that con naïve nineteenth-century audiences in the age of Mesmer and Liszt. And Eisenheim's tricks are inevitably marred, cinematically, by the fact that he's mostly not doing them but having them done for him on film, processed in by the editors and special effects guys.<br/><br/>Finally Holden also says this finds a good use for Edward Norton's ""disturbing inscrutability."" Is that what it is, though? Or is it a quality of being technically skilled but cold, mechanical, lacking in presence -- as well as limp in the area of sex appeal? (In fact the movie's sole purveyor of animal attraction is Jessica Biel as Sophie, the noblewoman both the Crown Prince and Eisenheim want. She and Eisenheim were secret teenage sweethearts even though she was an aristocrat and he was a carpenter's son (don't ask). She's sexy, but due to some shortcomings in the acting line she's a bit limp too -- you can't remember anything she says -- but if you look at her lips or her cleavage, that does the much-needed job of giving the screen a pulse.<br/><br/>Actually, though Norton is the Illusionist, and his romance with Ms. Biel, revived when he returns from fifteen years of wandering in the Far East, highly dangerous now that she's semi-betrothed to the Crown Prince, is the movie's plot's main focus, still the movie wouldn't get off the ground if it weren't for the fact that Paul Giamatti has an equally important role as the head cop the Prince sends in to hound Eisenheim's footsteps. And that's not enough either: Rufus Sewall in his scene-chewing performance as the obnoxious Crown Prince gives Norton and Giamatti a very necessary run for their money. Put them all together, though, and despite the fact that this is a romance, you still haven't got a single male hearthrob -- not in these roles.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is an impressively skillful mechanical ""character"" actor -- something that we don't necessarily associate with movie acting, but which movies nonetheless always need. He can deliver any tone or personality, within the limits of his schlubby looks -- which aren't really so confining, given that the world arguably contains more schlubs than Hugh Jackmans. His technical skill and adaptability would mean little if he didn't have that cuddly, slightly goofy but still smart and competent quality that makes his characters believable, sympathetic, and fun to watch. There's always an edge of a twinkle in Paul's face, when he's working well. There's the bustle of the buffoon in him. He's best as an amiable loser, as he is as Harvey Pekar in American Splendor and as Miles in Sideways, his best roles to date, not to say immortal ones. Since then he has gone on to bigger and better checks, but not better acting opportunities or as good movies, though his work is always admirable and he brings palpable enthusiasm to his work. He inhabits Herr Uhl, the Viennese chief inspector of police he has to play in The Illusionist, as convincingly as ever, but the man is such a dutiful and serious good-boy-in-school type, that when the laughs come they tend to seem unintentional.<br/><br/>Rufus Sewall, another versatile character actor whose looks give him the embarrassing additional option of being a leading man, is trying so hard to be strange and unpleasant and scary as Crown Prince Leopold, with his big dark over-precise moustache and thin parenthetical made-up looking eyebrows, that his looks in modern terms are so effete as to make him seem ""gay."" Compare Pascal Greggory as Jean Hervey in Patrice Chéreau's Gabrielle, a similarly effete character who's so subtly done he becomes complex and tragic. Sewall's Leopold is obtrusive, joining into the magic show at Eisenheim's command performance at court to his own embarrassment; but Leopold's menace in Biel's stiff staging seems a bit theatrical and empty. The worst thing he does on screen (to anybody else, anyway) is smack a lady, despite his wearing a sword and brandishing a pistol. The way he meets his end isn't surprising. Before that he has long turned into a barking stick figure. If only Sewall had been encouraged to play the Prince straighter (in both senses) and more vulnerable, the character would have been more interesting and the story would have had more subtlety.<br/><br/>Simplistic and greeting-card conventional as it is, The Illusionist is a good-looking movie in a traditional costume-pic sort of way, and you have the feeling it actually was probably shot either in Vienna or somewhere that for Americans can pass for Vienna. There are nice street scenes and crowd scenes and the look is glossy without being overbearing or calling attention to itself -- it doesn't surprise you either, though.<br/><br/>After the heroine comes to grief, things get messy and a bit confusing, where before they had all been orderly and well-paced. It's not clear what's gone wrong, but bad editing certainly is a factor. The way everything is explained in a montage of flash-shot reviews of past moments doesn't make up for the anticlimax. The Illusionist has a few good scenes, but no high drama. It is not helped by the chilly little voice Norton adopts, perhaps imitating some Forties costume drama, which the director himself may have wished to evoke."

","I have just finished watching this movie for the first time- nearly eight years after it's theatrical release. Really, I could have gone another eight years and it would have not made a difference. I never cared one way or another about seeing it.<br/><br/>My review isn't really about dissecting the plot. It is more about my opinion of the performances and film as a whole.<br/><br/>I'm usually a fan of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, but not so much this time. Norton, normally a brilliant actor, felt absent in this film. At times he seemed entirely uninterested to be there. Did someone force him to do this role? Not to mention his accent grated on my eardrums. Giamatti felt forced, sometimes overacting, even he didn't seem to want to buy what he was selling. As for Jessica Biel, although she looked lovely throughout the film, she was bland and lacked any depth. Biel could've been replaced by a life-size porcelain doll and we would get the same results.<br/><br/>The only redeeming performances for me were Rufus Sewell as Prince Leopold and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Norton's character's younger self. I got to a point in the movie where I would happily trade in Taylor-Johnson for Norton for the entire ride. Prince Leopold is a spoiled, self-absorbed bully, and no doubt I was rooting for him to fail. Still, it was refreshing anytime Sewell was on screen. His scenes were the only times I didn't feel like I was watching a performance, the only times I got lost in this movie. He brought a subtle intensity that was lacking in the other leads.<br/><br/>All in all I felt the movie had an interesting storyline that was not executed well. The ending was meant to be this big revelation and it simply wasn't. I saw it coming (having never heard anything about its ending even after eight years.) I liked the *idea* of the movie, more than the actual movie. The entire thing fell flat for me. Definitely did not live up to its hype. Other redeeming qualities are lighting, costume and set design. The whole film is stunning visually. My rating is due to bad and unconvincing performances from great actors (seriously, how does that happen?) and my feeling absolutely nothing while watching."
"Desertman84","9","2","4","28 September 2012"," A Fantastic Film
","The Illusionist is a period drama that features Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel. It is based loosely on Steven Millhauser's short story, ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"". The film tells the story of Eisenheim, a magician in fin de siècle Vienna, who uses his abilities to secure the love of a woman far above his social standing.It was written and directed by Neil Burger.<br/><br/>A supernaturally talented magician attempts to undermine the rigid social structure of turn-of-the-century Vienna by using his powers to win the love of his upper-class, childhood sweetheart. Though the ill- fated childhood romance between cabinetmaker's son Eisenheim and upper- class Sophie von Teschen eventually resulted in the heartbroken young man leaving Austria to explore the world, his dreams of one day reuniting with the beautiful duchess never faded. Upon returning to Vienna 15 years later as a talented and renowned illusionist, Eisenheim's hopes of a reunion seem dashed when he learns that Sophie is currently engaged to the Crown Prince Leopold. As the tensions between the Eisenheim and Leopold elevate, urbane Chief Inspector Uhl finds his sympathy toward Eisenheim growing, despite his formal obligations to the powerful prince.<br/><br/>First screened in Europe and scheduled for limited release in the U.S., The movie offers welcome proof that ""arthouse"" quality needn't be limited to the art houses. Set in turn-of-the-century Vienna, this stately, elegant period film benefited from a crossover release in mainstream cinemas, and showed considerable box-office staying power and the allure of Jessica Biel, who rises to the occasion with a fine performance. But there's equal appeal in the casting of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, who bring their formidable talents to bear on the intriguing tale of a celebrated magician.Overall,it was a engrossing, well-crafted story of mystery, magic and intrigue that is certain to enchant and entertain the viewer."

"bonnie91","8","2","4","13 January 2007"," Great drama and love story, but don't expect a lot of action
","Don't get me wrong. This move is not slow or boring, despite an overall lack of what we've come to know as action (basically brawls, cat-fights, chase scenes, people doling out and receiving violence, etc.). The plot is entertaining, the glimpses of the world of the magician are interesting, albeit not very detailed, and the love story that basically holds it all together is believable and well-acted by the protagonists, Edward Norton and Jessica Biel. Edward's role is understated and, at first glance, might seem wooden, but overall he is able to gain our empathy with his character, Eisenheim, and Eisenheim's dilemma and self-appointed mission.<br/><br/>It is beautifully filmed and keeps you so well entertained that the surprises along the way become that much more enjoyable, given the fact that you're so distracted. It certainly lives up to its title. The Illusionist is not only about a magician, but it weaves a magical spell all it's own. Although not perfect in it's execution, I'd still recommend it as a movie not to be missed and an awesome example of how fiction movies should depict their subject-matter, which usually involves molding pieces of reality and fantasy to aptly tell a story, anyway."

","The movie itself is about illusion and, true to its subject, it uses slight of hand to tell an interesting and thrilling story while in the same time dazzling us with the socio-political situation of the time. In the end, we see that was only the dust in the eye.<br/><br/>I expected good acting from Edward Norton, as I expected a good script. This guy seems to accept only interesting stories to play in, and I applaud him for it. Jessica Biel plays the beautiful, yes stylish lady, in a role in which I wouldn't have easily placed her in. But she performs beautifully. Rufus Sewell is again cast in the role of a violent frustrated man. The big surprise came from Paul Giamatti, playing a rather powerful role as opposed to the usual insecure and weird guy he usually plays. He is also the narrator of the story and the main point of view. He did very nice, making this a good movie as much, if not more, as Edward Norton.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a definitely must see movie. As it happens with intelligent, well done movies, I've stumbled only accidentally over it and I didn't regret it."
"inkblot11","8","2","4","23 September 2006"," It's no illusion, this film delivers on every promise
","Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and Sophie (Jessica Biel) are childhood friends. This is odd, because Sophie is a duchess and Eisenheim merely the son of a cabinet maker. They meet in secret until, one day, her relatives discover their friendship and forbid them to see each other again. Heartbroken, Eisenheim goes abroad for 15 years. He returns as a talented magician and causes quite a stir with the shows he puts on in his native Vienna. One evening, a crown prince attends a show with his fiancé, beautiful Duchess Sophie. The prince volunteers his lady for a magic trick and it is a stunner. But, more important, the two old friends are reaquainted. They rediscover their love for each other but know that it can not be permanent. The crown prince is an evil man who would hunt them down wherever they would go, it is said. Is there no way that true love can triumph? This is a lovely, lovely film that takes the viewer to a different time and place with splendor. The principal actors are wonderful, Norton and Biel giving touching performances as the lovers, and Rufus Sewell giving another fine but dark turn as the evil prince. (Hopefully, someone, someday will give Sewell another comedy such as Uncorked was, to appear in.) Paul Giamatti also embodies his role as a Viennese police officer very well. The settings and costumes are magnificent and the script is sweet, well-written, and efficient. Those who love history, magic, and romance will take to this film like a moth to a candle. But, truly everyone who sits down to watch the movie will get caught up in its unusual and beautiful story. It's no illusion, this film truly delivers on every promise."
"PortugalOle7","8","2","4","15 September 2006"," Count on Norton
","I have to give the guy credit, besides maybe The Italian job, which was because of contractual obligations, he always picks the right movies to be a part of.<br/><br/>I must admit I probably would have skipped this one if Norton wasn't in it. He's one of those actors for me that I will see a movie he is in, no matter what the genre or story. I was pleased with this movie.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti probably took the rug out from under Norton in this one however. He is just fabulous as the police detective assigned to keep tabs on Norton's magician character. Giamatti's quirkiness and facial expressions make him a joy to watch. Jessica Biel didn't do anything to detract from the film, which is good i guess, in fact she is not bad in it. Norton, Giamatti, and Biel I must say all hold those Austrian accents very well.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat predictable and losses steam in certain parts. The ending you can sort of see coming but the film as a whole is an enjoyable mysterious romance.<br/><br/>Great sets and costumes. The visual effects are also well done, very subtle, which for this film is a necessity."
"kqoe","Null","2","4","3 September 2006"," Too much talent doing very little effort
","The trailers proudly boast this production company also gave us ""Sideways"" and ""Crash."" The cast list indicates top notch talent usually doing their finest work in independent productions. But this film disappoints on so many levels. With the lone exception of Rufus Sewell, every other major performance is substandard work (I thought Edward Norten was sleepwalking and Jessica Biel seemed intend on keeping her dialogue a secret). Paul Giamatti made a half hearted attempt to give his character more layered traits than two dimensional cardboard performances of the others and his facial expressions were interesting when not being so forced.<br/><br/>Rufus Sewell did explore new directions in villianry which was lost only once in that silly scene where his Crown Prince character went ""undercover"" as a commoner. Otherwise he, and he alone, was the only performance worth watching.<br/><br/>The usual suspect when talent this good does performances this bad is an uninspiring script. And yes, Neil Burger's script is mainly the culprit. Right from the opening he uses trite devices of too much dialogue to start the story; committing the same crime of triteness at the end when 35 seconds of flashbacks is all we get for a payoff. Not that there was that much memorable dialogue to begin with. Maybe Jessica Biel, who whispered too much, had it right. You know a script writer is failing you when it is easy to mouth most everyone's next line because it is all so predictable. I did too many times. <br/><br/>And for a real farce, Director Neil's staging of the Obligatory Sex Scene was more comical than anything else. It was unusually original for a bedroom scene but there is a good reason no one else has tried that approach.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" main redeeming quality is the careful attention to detail to show 18th century Czech Republic and Budapest. It was a delightful 99 minutes of good history and colorful old world charm. I would have appreciated it more if this uninspiring movie was not in the way of the documentary and travelogue."
"Sputtosi","10","2","4","31 August 2006"," Edward Norton is no illusion.
","Edward Norton is certainly one of the most brilliant actor of his generation. One can remember his first role in Primal Fear and we knew we had a strong actor in the making. Norton showed that Primal Fear was no luck and he went on with solid performances in movies like: The Score, Fight Club, American History X and many more. What characterizes Norton is his ability of disappearing behind different characters. His versatility makes him one the best and intriguing actor of his generation with Leonardo di Caprio, and some others. <br/><br/>The Illusionist is one of the rare films this year which is not an action pack, a thriller, an horror slick or a comedy. The Illusionist is much more than that. This movie is the essence of cinema. Like cinema nothing you see is real!!! It's all a big illusion. <br/><br/>In this movie fellow actors teamed up with Norton to give the audience a real troubling romantic story rarely seen on the silver screen. I'd like to mention the excellent Paul Giametti ( Lady in the Water, Sideways) along with distinguished beautiful Jessica Biel and the subtle Rufus Sewell in the revolting Prince Leopold. <br/><br/>The cinematography takes, here, a serious option for best in the next Oscar race. Dick Pope pictured Vienna at the turn of the century like we never seen before. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie run to see it. Not only you'll spend a good time but you will also see a superb performance by an actor names ED NORTON who is not an illusion. <br/><br/>10 out 10 The movie of the year. <br/><br/>Roger Cardinal 30-08-06"

If Rudolf had remained as heir to the throne, would his liberal reign have prevented WWI, etc.?<br/><br/>I was not surprised that the few people I talked with in the theatre, knew nothing of the historical setting of the movie.

","Motion pictures are an illusion. They aren't really made of moving images at all, just a series of stills projected at 24 frames per second. The motion is a trick created with the help of shutters, lenses, a little sprocket device known as the Maltese cross -- and the human brain, through a phenomenon known as persistence of vision.<br/><br/>Jean-Luc Godard famously claimed that cinema is the truth 24 times per second; Brian De Palma countered that it's really 24 lies per second; and Pablo Picasso offered the cosmic perspective that art is a lie that tells the truth. All of these things -- tricks of the eye, mechanical illusions, artistic skills, suspension of disbelief, philosophical principles, metaphysical questions -- are at the mysterious, romantic heart of ""The Illusionist,"" written and directed by Neil Burger, and based on the story ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"" by Steven Millhauser.<br/><br/>Like ""F for Fake,"" the delightful meditation on art and deception by Orson Welles, ""The Illusionist"" places the very film you're watching at the center of the illusion. There's an irony inherent in making a movie about magic, since the photographic medium is discontinuous and subject to post-production manipulations beyond those that can be created before a live audience. But it also focuses your attention elsewhere, on the illusory properties of movies and storytelling, and how much we love to be dazzled by illusions in art, politics, religion, and other realms.<br/><br/>This coolly entertaining turn-of-the-century fable, told mostly in flashback by Vienna's Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), concerns the political and philosophical duel between Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton) and Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Poised between them is the enchanting Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), furtive childhood soul mate of Eisenheim and possible future princess of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<br/><br/>Leopold sees himself as a man of reason, certain that Eisenheim (rhymes with ""Eisenstein"") is a fraud. But the enigmatic Eisenheim may be an even better politician than the volatile Machiavellian prince: He lets his illusions speak for themselves, making no overt supernatural assertions but letting his audience interpret for themselves -- a tactic that only enhances his mystical renown, and his sway over the enraptured Viennese populace.<br/><br/>Uhl, a narrator whose perspective is limited by what he thinks he has pieced together about Eisenheim and his shrouded past, is, like Sophie, caught up in the tension between the magician and the monarch. He's not an omniscient story teller -- like any detective, he just fills in any gaps in the case with his instincts and imagination.<br/><br/>The movie sets up a fascinating parable about art, religion and politics, and the misty boundaries between them. Leopold sees Eisenheim's popularity as a political threat to his plans to become king, and Eisenheim repeatedly challenges the prince's authority in his act, through indirection. Religious leaders seize upon Eisenheim's apparent conjuring of spirits as both a blow against empirical science and absolute proof of the immortality of the soul -- as if the soul could ever be validated through corporeal measures, or magic tricks.<br/><br/>A critic for a Viennese newspaper raves that the Eisenheim's work transcends mere sleight-of-hand and approaches the realm of art. So it does not seem like mere hyperbole when the magician's manager introduces him by invoking ""the forces of the universe"" -- life and death, space and time, fate and chance. Those are, indeed, the stuff that dreams -- and art, and illusions -- are made of.<br/><br/>If ""The Illusionist"" approaches the realm of art, its spell is heightened by a subtly mesmerizing Philip Glass score and cinematographer Dick Pope's flickering, sepia-tinted visuals, evoking early motion pictures and 19th century daguerreotypes. In the (imagined) scenes from Eisenheim's childhood, the edges of the frame blur into shadows, surrounding the picture with mystery. And as the movie peels back layers of its core conundrum, the images and their colors become clearer and brighter.<br/><br/>In the early days of movies, the novelty of photographic illusions wore off as audiences became accustomed to the conventions of the new medium. Filmmakers soon discovered perhaps the greatest cinematic special effect ever invented: the movie star. The human face, if it's the right human face, can be the most spellbinding of subjects, the actors' splendid faces are at the heart of the dazzling illusions in ""The Illusionist"" -- the mirrors in which the real magic is reflected. The screenplay and direction aren't particularly strong (I would have loved to have seen what Werner Herzog could have made with this material), so it wouldn't be half as entertaining without the right actors.<br/><br/>As Sophie, Biel is beguiling but not ephemeral; she refuses to conform to Victorian images of women as benign reflections of men's desires. Sophie is a woman whose heart, mind and flesh are her own. Sewell's mustachioed Leopold is at once formidable and ridiculous, fearsome and pathetic.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is an actor of fierce intelligence, and with the lower half of his face masked behind an impenetrable Van Dyke, and the rest framed by a sleek black mane, his dark, penetrating irises conjure some of the film's best effects. When he tells a volunteer from the audience to look into his eyes and nowhere else, it's almost an in-joke. Where else would you possibly look?<br/><br/>But the film depends on Giamatti, as the audience surrogate, to do much of the work as magician's assistant. His devotion alone to ""Lady in the Water"" lent M. Night Shyamalan's soggy illusion whatever sense of conviction it had. He's introduced as the would-be villain, striding down a hellish corridor lined with severed animal heads and antlers, but he soon becomes the most human and likable presence in the film. His expressions and line readings alone are worth the price of admission, as they convey Uhl's uncomfortable position on the horns of a devilish dilemma, or his Holmesian delight in assembling another section of the picture-puzzle."

"slokes","5","0","0","12 April 2015"," Icebox Games
","Lovely but inert, ""The Illusionist"" stands and falls on the basis of its trickery, both in its story and its visuals. If you aren't the questioning sort, you may be entertained, though not too deeply.<br/><br/>The film opens on a provincial stage in the old Austria-Hungarian Empire, where a police chief inspector named Ulm (Paul Giamatti) is about to arrest a magician named Eisenheim (Edward Norton) in mid- performance. A lengthy flashback then shows us how Eisenheim's love of the Duchess von Teschen (Jessica Biel) caused him to create a unique show involving the promise of life after death that threatens the stability of the empire and the heir to its throne.<br/><br/>A term credited to Alfred Hitchcock, ""icebox scenes,"" come into play a lot in ""The Illusionist."" Basically, they are scenes that you take at face value the first time you view the movie, but wonder about after, maybe while getting a glass of milk at the fridge. As the subject in ""The Illusionist"" is visual trickery, you are meant to wonder after at how what you see comports with what actually happens.<br/><br/>It doesn't quite gel, though. Trickery in ""The Illusionist"" is often of an artificially-enhanced variety that adds to an already-yawning distance between audience and characters.<br/><br/>Part of this comes from a story which never takes off. There is a stuffy, ""Masterpiece Theater"" vibe about ""The Illusionist"" with its fancy décor and costumes, as well as its focus on class and overall sense of restraint. The cinematography takes advantage of beautiful Czech locations, but overdoes the sepia tones; while a Philip Glass score is alternately hypnotizing and soporific.<br/><br/>The performances also keep you at a distance. Norton is very slick and assured in the lead role, but as usual with him I found myself disengaged. Giamatti is similar; a game performance but a bit too stiff. Biel wears the mantle of her gorgeousness with accomplished grace, but her character's romance with Eisenheim is the film's weakest element. ""The only mystery I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you,"" is what passes for love talk between them.<br/><br/>The one standout element of this film for me was Rufus Sewell's dynamite performance as the film's heavy, Crown Prince Rudolf. Sewell plays his part with an understated arrogance that blends deftly with the ambiguity of the character as written, a political progressive with an imperious air and a reputation for hurting women. He also gives an otherwise too-quiet Norton a chance to draw sparks from someone else.<br/><br/>There's much potential for icebox talk with Rudolf, yet whenever he's not on screen the film contents itself with gaudy demonstrations of Eisenheim's trickery, prompting icebox talk of another, less happy kind. You wonder after at the improbable string of coincidences that seem to fall into place, the way Eisenheim's magic is pulled off so flawlessly in unlikely ways. It puts more attention on the CGI and director-screenwriter Neil Burger's story contortions than the film can safely handle.<br/><br/>Burger does offer a smart film here, and deserves credit for keeping a potentially outsized story from getting out of hand. There is a lot of charm on offer, and worthwhile moments. But the emptiness at the center is hard to ignore. As illusions go, this won't keep you wondering at the icebox very long."

","Together with Christopher Nolan's The Prestige & Woody Allen's Scoop, The Illusionist is one of the three films released in 2006 which explores the world of stage magicians and even though it doesn't quite reach the creative heights of Nolan's thriller, it's a neatly crafted period drama that manages to leave its own enchantments on the viewers' emotions, thanks to its brilliant direction, smart writing & sincere performances.<br/><br/>Set in late 19th century Vienna, The Illusionist tells the story of Eisenheim, a renowned illusionist who uses his magical abilities to secure the love of a woman far above his social standing. When she becomes engaged to the Crown Prince, who himself comes with a rumoured history of brutality towards women, Eisenberg tries to free her from her shackles thus causing a series of conflicts between him & the Crown Prince that doesn't end too well for one of them.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Neil Burger, the film remains his finest work to date and is narrated in a non-chronological but cleverly edited manner that keeps the viewers' emotions invested in its premise. Cinematography is undoubtedly gorgeous, the other technical aspects are pretty sound in its execution, and the performances by Edward Norton, Paul Giammati & Jessica Biel are excellent with Giammati impressing the most as the cop torn between his duty & allegiance.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Illusionist is more or less a love story encapsulated with elements of period drama that works as an intriguing, engaging & entertaining cinema from start to finish. There are moments when it leaves the audience a bit lost with its characters' actions & motivations but in the end, every piece of puzzle eventually fits. All in all, The Illusionist may not be that great a magic trick that'll be forever remembered but it's stunning enough to leave its viewers in a state of absolute bliss for a while. Thoroughly recommended."

","The storyline isn't bad, I liked how they went from the discussion between the chief inspector and the crown prince to the story of their childhood to the main story and then back to the discussion. However it was a bit flat to me, and I wanted to see more tricks. The movie is pretty good but if I had to choose a movie about illusions, tricks and magic I'd definitely choose The Prestige over this one. The main reason is: everything is explained at the end. I quite liked it until they started explaining the trick. The end would have be better if they had just gave a glimpse of the truth and let the rest to the viewers' imagination... in my opinion.. On the other hand, I would have loved to know HOW he did the ghost trick. This deserved an explanation lol<br/><br/>PS: the main character looks too much like Richard Armitage, I'm confused...!"

","The Illusionist is a good film with an interesting story. I don't sure if the Edward Norton is the right person for the role but anyway, he's great. Sadly, I can't say the same thing for Jessica Biel. She looks kinda fake and I just don't like her in this character. I think Rachel McAdams would be perfect for this role. But the guy who plays detective is great, i love his reactions at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>It's a enjoyable film, but that's all. Story has some issues and missing parts. Like, we don't know anything about the main character's history or how he get there. He just goes to some Asian countries and when he returns, he is a great magician. I mean how? I know it's a love story but still. And the love part of the story it's just not believable; may be because of the Jessica Biel's acting. The movie gives us no clues and in the end somehow everything makes sense. For example in the prestige, they give you some clues so you can guess the end of the story. But not in the illusionist. <br/><br/>If you love Edward Norton and this kind of movies, you should watch it. You won't be regret it. It's really not a bad movie but it could be much much better."

","Neil Bunger's 'The Illusionist' most naturally compares with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', two large-budget films about turn-of-the-20th century magicians that came out at around the same time. Neither film is perfect. At times, 'The Prestige' felt unduly mechanical; 'The Illusionist', on the other hand, is arguably easier entertainment, but is in places corny, I don't really understand the bizarre range of accents heard in what is supposedly Viena (some actors speak in a Gemranic English, while others speak pure American) and the plot, though entrancing up to a point, doesn't quite make sense. 'The Prestige' pushed plausibility, and even invented its own laws of physics to explain its story, but it was internally consistent (and indeed, like most good stories, a story of dealing with constraints). 'The Ilusionist' appears, on the other hand, to rely on what seems like genuine magic: at the end, one of the leading characters has a sudden revelation as to how it was done, but the explanation still leaves a lot unanswered. In some ways, films like this one suffer a problem: they leave too little to the imagination. One goes to a show, one thinks one knows what one has seen, and the ""magic"" is that we have been tricked into having failed to grasp what has really happened. But the neutral, third-person point-of-view of a film seems to make a definitive statement as to what has occurred, so making illusion concrete and at the same time fantastical. This is a flawed film; but still an entertaining one."

This review is written only to put forward the notion that there is a minor (but, in effect, major) flaw in the way the story is constructed.<br/><br/>*spoiler alert*<br/><br/>When the Chief Inspector first inspects the stable, he catches a glimpse of something shiny in the straw, but is hurried away by his colleague before he can take a closer look. Then, later, after what might be weeks but probably months, he is prompted by the magician's illusion to search the straw once again, only to find the missing locket and another gem from the sword. At the end of the film, in the short 'revelation' sequence, we see the duchess planting the locket as a clue, as well as spraying the sword with fake blood.<br/><br/>I have two very simple reservations here.<br/><br/>1. When Leopold woke up, wouldn't he find the locket next to his sword and destroy it, together with the blood? And while washing blood off his sword, wouldn't he notice that two of the gems (one of them being fairly prominent) were missing? (this is a fairly weak argument, as Leopold was probably experiencing a bit of a hangover and moreover, was in a hurry and distressed)<br/><br/>2. Given the length of time between the Inspector's two searches in the stable, wouldn't the straw be changed a number of times, thus allowing for the gems and locket to be lost?<br/><br/>If it were not for the 'revelation' scene, we could always assume that the clues were planted in the stable shortly before the inspector's arrival, although even that is highly unlikely.<br/><br/>*end of spoiler alert*<br/><br/>I would be grateful for your insights."

","""The Illusionist"" is a wonderful film, partially based on some real-life events and characters. It's easily confused with ""The Prestige"" because both concern magicians at the turn of the century, and both films were released in the same year. I admit to liking ""The Prestige"" a little more - it was directed with sleight of hand as well as being about it; I did figure out ""The Illusionist,"" whereas ""The Prestige"" kept me guessing.<br/><br/>But both films are really quite different. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, a magician who never stopped loving his childhood friend, Sophie, a duchess and, of course, of another class. He meets her again; she is in love with him, though she is now engaged to Crown Prince Leopold, who is to succeed his father to the Austrian throne. Leopold is a controlling and powerful man. He sees right away that Eisenheim is dangerous, not to mention scary with his phenomenal illusions. He has a chief inspector (Paul Giamatti) watching him and reporting back to him at all times. When Eisenheim and Sophie are spotted together, Leopold becomes more determined than ever to get rid of Eisenheim.<br/><br/>This is a rich, atmospheric film with wonderful performances, particularly from Edward Norton. Paul Giamatti is such a marvelous actor, I wish his role had been a richer one. Jessica Biel makes a beautiful Sophie. I had a couple of problems: one is the use of accents. In their own country, the people would be speaking German, not English with a German accent, so why not use no accents? We certainly know we're in another country in another time - the film was shot in the Czech republic, and it's gorgeous to look at.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" asks us to look at what is illusion and what is reality - or are they both the same thing?"
"lewiskendell","8","0","0","12 April 2010"," Impressive, but not the best.
","There have been many comparisons made between The Illusionist and The Prestige, and understandably so. They were released not very far apart. They both deal with magicians, and pushing the boundaries of what is considered illusion and what is considered real. Both of them have solid casts (though I do wish that Liv Tyler would have kept Jessica Biel's role), captivating stories, and twisting plots. But while The Prestige is one of my very favorite movies, I only consider The Illusionist to be a good one. <br/><br/>The plot of The Illusionist is simple, it's basically a love story. There are some incredible moments sprinkled throughout the narrative, and a few particularly memorable parts that stand among my very favorite scenes in any movie. I almost felt a sense of wonder akin to the audience members at Eisenheim's shows. But as I said, the story is ultimately a very familiar one. It works well within the context of the movie, but compared to The Prestige, it seems almost pedestrian. The cinematography was amazing, though. I loved the vignette-type style in which the movie was shot. <br/><br/>I have to say, that this is my favorite Edward Norton performance. He captures the mystery and almost sinister potential power of Eisenheim, perfectly. You're almost forced to believe the impossible may be possible, because of Norton's persona. No one else really rises to the heights of Norton's performance, but the other actors still play their roles reasonably well. <br/><br/>The Illusionist is a very good movie, and I think it would have stood out even more, if not released so close to a similar movie that I consider to be superior. The focus on a love story will probably make this even more appealing to some people, than it was to me."

That is the most important part of movie which was skipped. I remember Rufus Sewell from Dark City. But this time I think he was not that good at all.

","Neil Burger is a magical director whose film plays clever mind tricks on his audiences. ""The Illusionist"" is brilliantly planned to confuse viewers and leave them feeling like they were a part of the magic shows in the film. The twists and turns in the film keep the movie fresh and audiences interested-- yet the suspense is not that of a horror film-- it is of wanting to know all of Eisenheim's (Edward Norton) secrets. Several times during the film, the audience is brought to a magic show setting, one of wonder and confusion. During these magic shows, secret truths are slowly revealed by the stunts Eisenheim presents. Throughout the film, new secrets are discovered and leave the viewers to ponder that everything is not what it seems.<br/><br/>In Burger's film, a young carpenter's son with low social status, Eisenheim, falls in love with the beautiful Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), but, naturally, their love is frowned upon by society. Hurt by their forbidden love yet fascinated by the world of magic, Eisenheim travels the world as a clever illusionist. While he is away, Duchess von Teschen falls in love with a man accepted by the early twentieth century society, the Crown Prince. When the Duchess happens to be a participant in one of Eisenheim's shows, the reunion makes them realize their love for one another was never abandoned. Eisenheim uses his clever mind tricks and illusions to save the Duchess from the relationship. <br/><br/>""The Illusionist's"" characters make this a must see movie, and they are portrayed brilliantly. Edward Norton brings Eisenheim to life through strong emotion he expresses in his eyes. His strong, but quiet confidence is appealing because it makes the illusions more believable. Initially, Jessica Biel is somewhat dry and takes time to warm up and get into character. When she comes into her own, however, she is breath of fresh air to the dark lighting in the film. Paul Giamatti does a great job at illustrating the frustrating relationship between Eisenheim and his character, the Chief Inspector Uhl. His quest to find answers about the magician is captivating."
"silverscreen888","7","0","0","16 May 2009"," A Beautifully-Photographed Near-Classic with One Developmental Flaw
","""The Illusionist"" (2006) is a very beautiful film I suggest with a splendidly attractive surface that founders on only one vital point, the impossibility of the illusions created and being used by its central character to bring down a tyrant. Neil Burger has directed this film in classical and intelligent style, never striving for sensational effect and getting the very most out of his cast. The story altogether too-obviously I assert was developed from a 'short story' from Steven Millhauser ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"", by the director. As is the case with too many films of recent vintage, including ""You've Got Mail"", ""Devil With a Blue Dress"" and dozens of others, the fundamental key to the film's full-realism was never discovered. This leaves the viewer with a very rich-looking modest-budget fantasy about the Hapsburg Empire's leadership class and its tendency toward totalitarianism and emotional instability. The subplot concerns the Crown Prince Leopold's bad character, that leads him to a desire to overthrow the Emperor. But the piece's main plot concerns the love of a man, now an Asian-trained world-class illusionist, for the Duchess who was his first love and is also the marital key to the Crown Prince's nefarious plan. This effort's dozen producers have achieved a surprisingly effective and sustained ""look"", in my judgment, through the use of horse-drawn vehicles and major buildings of the late 1800s--two theaters, a palace, a large house, a railway station and several streets, as well as attractive outdoor settings. For this unity of design, Cinematographer Dick Pope, Production Designer Ondrej Nekvasil, Art Directora Stefan Kovacik and Vlasta Svoboda, Set Decorator Petra Habova and Costume Designer Ngila Dickson all deserve high credit. Philip Glass's music never makes a complete point but it is lush and unobtrusively applied to the gorgeous tapestry of this period romance cum mystery, in my opinion. In the realm of acting, which for any costume film is so central to successful believability's being achieved by any filmmaker, the curious lack of development of characters at once makes the casting of vocally-competent players easier but also hamstrings their best efforts. They are, in effect, too-often reduced by this failing to two or three lines, in one scene or two. This lack I suggest is partly due to the failure of the adapter to develop the original story beyond its two lovers and two opponents; but it is also a result of the secretive nature of all three characters, none of whom is able to confine in anyone. Among the supporting cast, Robert Russel as a Spiritualist leader and young Elias Bauer as a messenger are given noticeable one-scene roles. Others having meaningful parts included Aaron Johnson and Eleanor Tomlinson as the youthful friends destined to be lovers, Karl Johnson as the Doctor, and others who are given two or three lines here or there, which seem surprisingly performed well in all cases. There are even theatrical, crowd and street scenes of impressive attractiveness and utility. As the Crown Prince, the mad Leopold, Rufus Sewell, works hard but is sometimes out of his depth in a part demanding a classical training. The same must be said for Edward Norton. His intelligence and theatrical competence allow him to execute the more-demanding speeches adequately or better; but much of the time he appears to be a merely thin and somewhat gangling character actor unable to find an approach to playing a charismatic leader of men; he is not helped by having no confidant to play off throughout most of the film, which leaves him often standing alone in large rooms and being questioned by others. Jessica Biel is sincere and lovely as the Duchess Sophie; all she lacks is a stage-trained voice to be added to all her other impressive credentials. So, I claim, it falls to narrator and Police Inspector Paul Giamatti to carry the film. This, I argue, he does in splendid Oscarworthy fashion from beginning to end. He alone in the cast is given a variety of moods as well as scenes to play; and the strength of the film's logic and his own success at achieving the effect the director desires are perhaps the project's greatest strengths. It should be noted that the narrative is not swift-paced but is nevertheless very satisfying throughout, even in theater-site scenes that in lesser hands might have slowed up the progress of the work. With a great leading man, such as the story deserved, and a solution to the believability of the illusions being depicted, which are so powerful they mystify an empire's best minds, the film might have achieved much more even than it did. What results, I argue, is an unusually handsome and very-well-told cinematic story, a near-classic well worth the seeing more than once, if only for its economy of means and unusual physical beauty."

They are separated and not reunited until years later. Then he has become a master illusionist and she the wife to be to the imperial heir. The flame is rekindled, but their love might be a threat to their lives.<br/><br/>Comments: First off, this is a visually stunning movie. The light, the mood, the angles. Every scene, every motion seems full of emotion. It really is a weave of an illusion with every picture being one of the threads. Only to watch each and every scene, even if they were disconnected, would have been enchanting.<br/><br/>Movie who are visually good often lack in the story. This does not. The weave that is made is very solid. Or it seems and feels that way anyway. It is a love story, a thriller and a murder story at the same time, juggling each ball/theme very well. Neither theme is lacking or is suppressed. Each has a key component to the whole. Also it keeps a great sense of wonder about it with the illusions, each more stunning than the last (even if I know that CGI might explain it). I really want to believe that the illusion is true, and to me that is a great feeling.<br/><br/>A great piece, a key piece in the puzzle is the acting. And even if the Crown Prince might be the bad guy, it is Eisenheim (Norton) and Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) that is the real opponents. And both bring their best. It was a long time ago I saw Norton and Giamatti this good. A near flawless performance from them both.<br/><br/>This was true entertainment. The sense of wonder, the sense that I couldn't miss a moment so that I didn't miss a crucial detail is rare. But it is a welcome feeling when I happen upon it.

Two nights ago, I sat down on my sofa, and saw it on Anytime TV, thought give it a go. I thought there was a couple of good actors, should do well....I just didn't realise it would this good. The script is extremely good, slowly building up the storyline through a flashback by Paul Giamatti's character, with good dialogue and character introductions, the script loves the small uses of characterisation to build up the characters. Now the performances: In the last year or so I have become more and more of a fan of Edward Norton, his performances so well layered, brilliantly understated. In this role, Edward Norton plays the role of a mysterious magician, able to spellbind audiences with ease, creating magnificent shows. His performance carries the majority of scenes. Jessica Biel is one of the most gorgeous women I have ever seen, and radiates the screen when she appears. It's believable that Edward Norton will risk everything to be with her, and then, be crushed and wounded following her murder. And Rufus Sewell, showing anger and an ego that destroys everyone around him. Sewell is actually a small understated role but gives the slight edge needed to make Norton's character better. But, the film is stolen, by one Paul Giamatti. The Detective who investigates Jessica Biel's murder, Rufus Sewell as her possible murderer, and Edward Norton for ""defrauding"" his audience, he is the key to the movie, tying them all together and also showing different actions with each actor, showing slight changes, showing how a Police Dectective would possibly really react to different classes. He also is intelligently self-coerced from a slightly corrupt Police Detective to a true Chief Of Police, and his narration is like a Morgan Freeman, easily listen-able whilst creating a better story. I would recommend this film, and also the performances, which really make the film"

","Any film with a title like this is bound to have a sting in its tail, and the sting here isn't going to cause anyone much pain: in fact it's one of those unexpected twists we've pretty much come to expect. The ever dependable Paul Giamatti is the best thing in the film as the morally dubious chief of police, living in the pocket of the half-mad Crown Prince but still near enough to the streets to identify with Edward Norton's master illusionist. Norton is good, but he's a little difficult to swallow in a period piece, and his European accent is a little suspect at times. The reveal, when it comes, is a little sketchy  especially about Eisenheim's powers of resurrection, but it doesn't really spoil the film that much. I'm quite surprised at its high rating, though."

Same goes for Biel who never had serious roles before and was proved talented after her first attempt which granted her a plenty of ""Rising Star"" awards.<br/><br/>On that very same year, something was going on with the adaptation of the theme ""Magic"" and the revival of famous magicians' names with no rational reason for this peculiar happening ""The Illusionist"" was one of them, which was the first and only hit for the undiscovered director Neil Burger, despite a low-profile movie ""Interview With The Assassin"" that collected two wins and four nominations but was poorly introduced to the audience.<br/><br/>It is undeniably some quality time to spend if you are interested in some romantic drama with a twist. If you enjoyed watching ""The Prestige"" which hit the screens on the same year then you would definitely love to watch this one."

","As I was watching this movie, I was telling myself: ""WAW.. Here is a new one for my list of the greatest 100 movies ever!"". But as the events went ahead, I found all the rest predictable, weak, and out of my high respected area. As the magnificent potentials of the movie went down to be just another entertaining Hollywood flick, but a bit bizarre and not as solid as its likes!<br/><br/>There are lots of good points to talk about. For most of the time, the movie looked proficiently strong, rarely interesting, and wonderfully made. For instance, I loved the sly performance of (Edward Norton) as (Eisenheim), the majestic music of (Philip Glass), the fantastic deceptive cinematography of (Dick Pope) as an old silent movie with all the exact taste of magic and the adroit tribute for that age, that cinema and that kind of feelings in front of a fancy tale. And above all, the genius performance of (Paul Giamatti) as (Uhl).<br/><br/>Basically the character of (Uhl) is so charming as the sincere inspector who is looking for the truth and bewitched by the magic too. He came from the bourgeoisie; being son of butcher like (Eisenheim) who is son of a carpenter, and deeply malcontent with great desire to fulfill justice. He loved and respected (Eisenheim)'s journey, defiance and adeptness; so no wonder to be the narrator of the story. He wanted to defeat the masters but not by magic, only by the law. I loved (Giamatti) performance, especially at the last scene where he was understanding, as well as enjoying, the whole trick at once in unforgettably astonishing scene.<br/><br/>As for the script, I think, from subjective viewpoint, that this movie has truly marvelous dimensions whereas it can be a story about logical mind vs. creative imagination, powerful authority vs. clever art, or even unjust rich tyrants vs. wronged poor people. It's a bright story indeed where the poor artist can threaten a despotic leader, after awakening and excitation the public opinion against the injustice along with his smart ability, not only to entertain but also to get away with his victory as a public hero who had the superiority over the less intelligent rulers. See, it's thoughtful and amusing. But it wasn't made like this!<br/><br/>The thing is the makers of the movie just abbreviated it to much simpler level, following the principle of ""I'm here just to entertain"" which's a line said by (Eisenheim) at one point. The problem is that they made their own entertaining movie in a weak way!<br/><br/>I hate to be the sound of mind here, but the magic of this movie contained some faults, and the illusionist's trick / the movie's twist was that obvious (at least for me!), not to mention the badness of its plot. And if you against me, just answer this: if the illusionist kidnapped the body of the alleged dead princess, then the imperial family buried who exactly?!, and if the prince was executed, then it confirms that the immaculate illusionist and his tender sweetheart are the actual killers of the story; whereas they were close to end somebody's life because a crime that he didn't commit or even think of!<br/><br/>They're couple of offensive holes indeed, however I thought that with a little thinking from the movie's writer, they could've been more sturdy and convincing. As for the first hole, (Eisenheim) could put a real corpse instead of the sleepy princess, or make a delusion by so many ruses: the corpse was deformed, drifted by the current, or eaten by the fish.. whatever! And as for the other hole, we could have seen that the prince ruthlessly killed a girl before, or he was intending of killing that princess at one step, or anything but making him such a naive jealous guy who is just intrinsically madly in love!<br/><br/>Actually, the movie's goal was nothing but making a delight romantic fairytale, with the exposed game of black frame around the image all the time; like an old magic lantern's show, as a pure nice deceiving vision. Unfortunately, it wasn't that perfect, with hasty script to disappointing degree. Though, I'll try to tell my mind what the princess told the over-thinking prince: ""Shut Up.. And Let's Watch The Show!"".<br/><br/>So eventually there is some reality in illusion; as the illusionist creates fancy to the people and confirms the excellence of his class, and some illusion in reality; as the princess is still alive, however nearly nobody knows about it. But even with the movie's own faults, I see that the main message of it will be that the illusion is more enjoyable when we never think about it. And maybe it's the oldest message of Hollywood at all."

","The title of the film is perhaps the greatest giveaway indicating this entire cinematic experience is pure illusion--mere chemical explosions on reels of film. But back to the film as almost a fun movie experience. The character's name Eisenheim suggests something truly playful, and the fine magical tricks that aren't insulting make the film worth watching. It's a mysterious love story, and accepting the going-ons on screen makes this film truly fine and a near classic. This review is real and will not disappear.<br/><br/>After having been disappointed by a series of films lately, this film is one of those rarities that comes along after a trail of twenty or twenty plus nonsense and time wasting time fillers."

","A beautiful, ethereal period piece that combines impassioned romance with ghostly magical illusions and stunning sepia-toned cinematography. Those looking for a twisty-turny, clever- clever Prestige-alike will be disappointed. Much has been made of the so-called 'twist' being blindingly obvious - but this misses the point entirely. This film is not about tortuous plot devices. It's a simple love story, and it's the brilliant writing, exceptional performances and sumptuous period detail that elevate it into something really special. Director Neil Burger takes the conventions of the folk fairytale - the oppressed beauty, the tyrannical prince, the mysterious saviour - and adds a real emotional depth and sophistication to create a tale that's touching and intriguing in equal measure. You really care about these characters, and their story stays with you long after the credits have rolled."

","It was ashame that in Europe The Prestige and The Illusionist were released almost simultaneously. It seems like there's always some sort of espionage going om in the movie industry because there are always at least two similar films released in a year. To separate the two movies the marketing engine of the Illusionist made it look like yet another hopeless love story in the likes of the Titanic. <br/><br/>However I was wrong, when I bought the DVD I started it and I was sucked in to the story line. The character Eisenheim played by Edward Norton is so mysterious and yet so charismatic that you just have to believe every word he says. And this is what makes the story so compelling the story is actually more of a quest to what's true and what's false or a lie. And during the 1 hour 40 minutes you're being played with as a viewer and the plot twist at the end was rather unexpected; where I'd found in The Prestige what the plot must've been here I was clueless.<br/><br/>The images are very nice and crisp and rather colourful and yet you feel like you're being drawn into the early 20th century. I loved the music and the sound they really contributed to the mystery and the images.<br/><br/>Is it better than The Prestige? I'd have to say no, because the characters in The Prestige are so much more complex, you've indeed two Eisenheims in that movie and it's a complete different genre to The Illusionist. The Illusionist is a just a brilliantly crafted thriller and when that's the way you look at it on a rainy evening huddled on the couch you will definitely enjoys this movie."

","I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Illusionist' and thought it superior to 'The Prestige'  a better story and better told. <br/><br/>While neither film really gave a believable sense of the Victorian era (see 'The Elephant Man' for how it should be done) 'The Illusionist' made a better job of it. I think the choice of the Czech Republic for location shooting really helped give 'The Illusionist' the edge.<br/><br/>For the acting, Jackman, Bale and Caine are all fine actors but in this example not in the same league as Norton, Giamatti and Sewell.<br/><br/>Philip Glass's music was wonderful and matched the film really well.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","This movie was truly one of the best I have ever seen. I have always had an interest in magicians and illusions, and this movie is a perfect fit for fans of both. I sat mesmerized throughout the entire thing, sometimes guessing what was going to happen next, and a couple times I was right. However, I have to admit to having absolutely no notion of how the ending was going to turn out. When the Prince committed suicide, I noticed that there wasn't much time left in the movie, so I knew things would wrap up soon. However, when Eisenheim got the locket from Uhl's pocket, I simply thought he would disappear on the train and that would be it. I had no idea the entire thing had been an illusion! Uhl's discovery of the truth, with the flashbacks and explanation, was my favorite part of the movie, and is probably that for most viewers. Truly, nothing is what it seems.<br/><br/>Watch 'The Illusionist.' You'll understand."

","A young boy falls in love with a girl that is way above his social standards along with the art of magic. Although the parents forbid them of seeing each other they cannot be split apart. Until one day they were found together and the boy was sent off. He became a magician and traveled the world. She fell in love with another man, the Crown Prince. The two got engaged but the boy, Eisenheim, finally meets back up with the girl and uses his powers to free her from the royal house in Vienna.<br/><br/>There was a movie that came out in 2004. It was called ""Saw"", a film known by many for its twist ending. I gave that film a perfect rating just for its ending and I suppose many others did as well. And giving that film a perfect rating just for its ending (I know, it's stupid), why not give this movie a perfect rating for its great ending?<br/><br/>I'm not giving this film a perfect rating only because of its ending, like I did ""Saw"". This film is immensely absorbing and spellbinding. It will keep your attention throughout the film and you'll love every second of it.<br/><br/>Edward Norton's performance is great, having less dialog in its second hour and does his performance with his actions. Paul Giamatti's performance was surprisingly good, acting in a subtle way and Jessica Biel's performance was good.<br/><br/>Unlike many films, The Illusionist's ending doesn't cheat the audience.

The only reason I limit it to 9 stars is because of my hesitation for giving any movie 10. That being said, this is easily one of the greatest films of the last year, or several years, for that matter. It is the product of unfortunate timing, jammed in-between summer blockbusters and the fall Oscar-worthy films and being overshadowed by the lesser film, the Prestige. The film is aesthetically pleasing, filmed in a warm, sepia-like tone. Use of conventions like the iris-effect also make this film unique and pleasing. The acting is simply unparalleled. Giamatti's performance is wonderful, but Edward Norton does an equally impressive job. Finally, the story reels you in. This film may well be a novel, for that is the level it approaches.

The movie was a masterpiece in plot, characters, acting and photography, till the last 5 minutes when the script writer got possessed by the ""Twist demon"". He ruined everything. We have been recruited emotionally for nothing, for the crown prince was innocent. There are many holes in here:<br/><br/>1- WHY ? .. Why did the wizard plot such a thing when he could easily escape with the Duchess ?. 2- She wasn't dead, but what about her burial ? How did she escape the sermons ? 3- Where was she hidden all this time ? what if the prince didn't commit suicide ?.. Would she remain hidden for ever ? 4- And above all... How did the inspector know all this and make these conclusions while the train was departing ?.. give me the pieces of the puzzle he connected. He had nothing at all except the wizard was on the train.. 5- So all this was a matter of stage play, so please gimme an explanation for the apparitions we saw, and Norton's disappearance from the stage. <br/><br/>Frankly, if the film ended when the train left the station, it would be much powerful.

","It's impossible not to compare this film to The Prestige. In my comment for that film I said that it reminded me of The Usual Suspects in a way, which was a good thing since that is one of my favorite films. So when I finally got around to seeing The Illusionist today, I was sort of stunned to see that this movie was actually trying to be like The Usual Suspects. I wish I could split-screen Chazz Palmintieri and Paul Giamatti's final scenes just to prove it to you.<br/><br/>This movie was okay. The acting was overdone at times. The plot was pretty obvious. Where Suspects left clues you didn't know were clues, the Illusionist leaves honking blatant clues. A blinking red arrow would have only been a little less subtle. I actually wonder how I would have felt about this movie if I hadn't seen The Prestige first. I didn't actually think they'd be as similar as they were in terms of the plot. It's interesting because in both cases you have a vendetta of sorts based around a woman. Here it's romantic silliness, there it's a battle of wills. And also in both films you have two great actors squaring off, but in that one you were blown away by the charisma duel between Bale and Jackman. Here you kinda realize that Giamatti and Norton are much better at being average Joes. They're not so flashy and neither is this film. I enjoy flashy films, maybe if you don't, you'll like this one better.<br/><br/>Having said all that it's not really bad. I don't think it should be avoided by any means. And if you like illusions I'd suggest seeing both films and deciding which you like better. I do think years from now The Prestige will be the ""classic"" and The Illusionist will be ""the other one""."

","""The Illusionist"" is not really bad, nor is it really good, setting it aside form the far superior ""The Prestigfe."" The performances are good, and the leading actors show us just how much fun they had making the film. Paul Giamatti is especially brilliant as Chief Inspector Ool. His accent is purposefully comical, and he brings the much-needed fun factor to the film. Ed Norton and Jessica Biel are given very little to do dramatically, but they do it just fine.<br/><br/>The real problem is that the film is not particularly interesting. The plot is very typical and dull at times, involving an arranged marriage, a wicked prince, a poor lover, doomed love, and a police investigation. The end, which I will not reveal, is also a disappointment. A word to the creators: there does not need to be a logical explanation for everything. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.<br/><br/>Still, ""The Illusionist"" has its kicks. Some scenes have a fittingly magical quality, the costumes are terrific, the set pieces are fitting and enchanting, and the Oscar-nominated cinematography is beautifully golden and crisp. It's a good film, but lacks greatness. Still, I would recommend it for the fun performances and beautiful look of the film."

But the movie told the story very well through uses of foreshadowing, great acting and great visuals.<br/><br/>A friend of mine always loves to point out whenever a story uses foreshadowing and when he saw this movie he almost had a heart attack. The key scene that symbolically told the whole story was the one where Sophie (Jessica Beil's character) was chosen as a volunteer for one of Eisenheim's illusions. A red robe (red also being a symbolic color of love, for example: a red rose) was placed over her and with the swing of a sword (as if cutting her), she was gone. As the story plays out, Sophie's death was faked to make her ""dissapear"" from her formal life of loneliness and she was to live with Eisenheim for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>One can spend a long time picking apart the story which is what makes this a good film for analytical movie buffs, so I figured be giving you a brief example of one of the many things that make this movie worth watching.

","I must agree with the comments indicating that the material covered in this movie would have been enough for a short story only and is - somewhat- insufficient for 110 minutes.<br/><br/>The aforementioned mystic aura of some sort is the best part of the Illusionist. The performances are fine as well- Edward Norton is, as always, very good at what he is doing, and Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell are also okay.I am very sorry Liv Tyler could not do the part of Eisenheim's love interest in the end, as her fairy-like person would have added a lot more to the mystique of the film.<br/><br/>You get to figure out the tricks of Eisenheim on the way along with Inspector Uhl. You do not get all of them explained. If you prefer explanations, go watch Prestige instead. <br/><br/>The music did the plot well and underlined the magic greatly, although in a somewhat repetitive manner. The camera works so well you get your eyes glued to the screen - even if you won't probably bite your nails in excitement. <br/><br/>The major problem is that while the Illusionist keeps you watching if you are a fan of myths & magic, it certainly does not hold a great plot twist. So no big surprises can be expected there. The ending is quite predictable. This is a pity because there is a lot of potential to the story, and there certainly would have been a lot more to the setting, and the characters, and the actors portraying them, if only it had been tapped.<br/><br/>Crown Prince Leopold's character should have been exploited much more. I missed a real confrontation or row between him and Eisenheim; the one at the Prince's premises was not much of that. The death of the Crown Prince is viewed by the director in a totally detached way which surely tries to say that bad guys always die in the end, but hey, who took whose fianceé around here? <br/><br/>Also- even the general basis of the story, i.e., that the girl and Eisenheim are childhood sweethearts, seems quite like a fairy tale itself- it is quite unlikely that a girl of her status would have been left alone on enough occasions to develop a relationship with a boy of his standing, and go unnoticed for an adequately long period of time.<br/><br/>So - I recommend you watch the Illusionist for what it is -a somewhat romantic fairy tale set in Vienna, in the era of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in the troubled and magic times of the great Eisenheim. And it is very good as THAT."

It depends on the audience knowing practically nothing about European history or customs. There are huge holes in the final plot illusion. (No spoilers here.) The concept is weak: a potentially interesting historical time and place are only dragged in for exotic interest, not for any intrinsic reason, there's no great emotional truth involved. The movie doesn't deliver on the significant drama it hints at.<br/><br/>My chief grudge is that I have seen two *truly great* movies about illusionists setting who come into terrifying conflict with power, in Hitler's Germany: Hanussen(1988),and Mephisto(1981),both by the Hungarian director István Szabó. Both movies were beautify, breathtaking, heavily weighted with fate and great events, and important things to say about the role of the artist. This movie seems like a cheap knockoff by comparison.<br/><br/>(Szabó made another impressive movie, Colonel Redl / Oberst Redl (1985), about a working class boy whose rising military career in the Austro-Hungarian Empire is wrecked on the reef of the aristocratic establishment.

The use of symbolism and subtlety is incredible. Though not as sensationalist as The Prestige, The Illusionist is in a class by itself. The acting, direction, story, everything is perfect. This is a perfect example of why you shouldn't always trust box office numbers and reviews when considering what to watch. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are perfect as always, and it is a wonderful and unusual tale, one of those where you always see something new every time you watch it.

It plays on the mythical theme of forbidden love and sets the stage in Victorian Europe.<br/><br/>There's some creative photography work from the beginning that will transport the watcher into another world beyond the mundane. I liked the chemistry between Norton and Biel. They definitely showed the passion of trying to hide their love from onlookers. The lovers are plagued with the world working against. Tons of problems get in their way such as arranged marriage, different classes, high-profile lives, police scrutiny and murder which makes it impossible to declare their love, much less get a moment together.<br/><br/>Giamatti plays the inspector who's fascinated by magic and tries to makes sense out of seemingly supernatural events. Although you see some of the action from the lovers' points of view, the story is very much told through Giamatti's observations.<br/><br/>If you like romance and the 19th century, you will love The Illusionist. I saw The Prestige around the same time which I found to be dark, brooding, and ugly (it was very disappointing). The Illusionist was everything I hoped the Prestige was going to be and more. I initially got turned off from seeing the Illusionist because reviews said the leads had no chemistry and there wasn't much of a mystery. I completely disagree. The Illusionist is a lovely film that uses magic for beauty, not for evil."

","Set in the turn of the century Vienna, The Illusionist is a beautifully filmed love story. Edward Norton(""The Italian Job"") gives another solid performance as the magician who falls in love with Jennifer Beals. Rufus Sewell(""The Holiday""), gives an excellent performance as Crown Prince Leopold. Paul Giamatti(""Sideways""), as Inspector Uhl, well, I confess that I don't understand his success in movies and Jennifer Beals really can't hold her own in this film with Norton and Sewell. <br/><br/>One of the cinematic tricks that really works in this film are the early scenes which are filmed like turn of the century Victorian photos complete with soft focus and oval matting. The present day scenes are equally well-filmed. Dick Pope (""Topsy Turvy"") was the cinematographer.<br/><br/>This film has one similarity to ""The Prestige"" in that it is about magic but the two films are completely different on all other levels.<br/><br/>Philip Glass provides an excellent musical score.<br/><br/>An understated film that is very pretty to look at, has excellent acting, and an interesting story line although if you like mysteries you may see the ending coming long before the movie disappears. I recommend this film and it would be fun to see ""The Prestige"" with it as a double bill."
"RolandCPhillips","7","0","0","1 May 2007"," Disappointing but, mysteriously, worth it
","When reading the multitude of usual press guff in the dailies, this film appeared to be mature, intelligent period piece, which appealed to me because it tried to combine a conventional story of magic and special effects, with something altogether more adult, namely the themes of government and conspiracy.<br/><br/>Turn of-the-century Europe was beautifully evoked with marvellous ornate sets and locations. The highly-polished and painstakingly lit cinematography portrayed a stuffy and hierarchical society and was aided by superb, understated special effects when master-illusionist Eisenheim stuns his rapt audience with amazing tricks. Burger used his scenario of illicit lovers (as Eisenheim tries to steal his childhood sweet-heart back from the arrogant, sadistic Prince Leopold) as a means of providing an alternative history to the birth entertainment for the masses. Leopold's hatred for Eisenheim is generated not only out of romantic competition or the usurper magician's veiled insults, but by the possibility that Eisenheim might steal the Prince's subjects. Eisenheim's generosity to street children, his rags-to-riches story and his attraction of the people are metaphors for the power of the media to undermine a country's rulers. The magic tricks, perhaps made possible by back projection through smoke in one instance, are early forms of computer trickery which typify much of modern cinematic output.Sadly, these themes are dissipated as the story continues.<br/><br/>The script began to focus on the rivalry between Eisenheim and Leopold over Duchess Sophie, and thus the story boiled down to history of rivals in love. Eisenheim and Leopold became crudely delineated protagonist-antagonist, the former generous and mysterious, the latter cruel and boorish. There is no doubt where our sympathies should lie, and this lack of complexity undermines the film's context, that of a Europe on the cusp of the twentieth-century and inevitable war. Eisenheim and Leopold could have acted as a metaphor for an increasingly fractious political climate, but they simply become duellists.<br/><br/>Nor does the film's plot sustain much interest in the third act. The 'twist' that arrives is not unexpected because of a framing device used at the start of the film and Eisenheim's very profession: we know he will save his greatest magic for the end, and it won't be on stage. Furthermore, the subsequent interpretation of Eisenheim's masterstroke by policeman Uhl only further detracts for the air of mystery. As a result, the last third suffers from serious dull patches. The film leaves a lasting impression but only on the technical rather than scripting level: the sepia-toning, excessive grain on the print and frequent iris shots all indicate the birth of cinema, taking place inside the film's time frame. This perhaps makes one reflect on the very construction of cinema, and how much it has changed since the 1900s, but it does not make one think of how history is written.<br/><br/>That said, I'm probably taking this much too seriously. Come on people, when was the last time we saw a film that took such care in telling such potentially hokey story, and succeeded in loading it with such thematic weight? Can't think. And for all my complaints, it remained an engrossing yarn. This is worth seeking out  it cast quite an incredible atmospheric spell over me at times  but be cautioned: it is never quite as entertaining as you might want, nor as intelligent."

","it was quite suspenseful and beautifully shot but I figured out the plot twist from the moment the illusionist(played by Edward Norton) enlightened the crown Prince (played by the always delightfully sinister Rufus Sewell) with the ""soul lives on"" trick. Maybe it's because I had seen The Prestige before this, I don't know but I figured out the ending way ahead of time and that kind of ruined the rest of it all for me. The story within the film is that of a young man with the talent for magic, who falls in love with a beautiful countess(Jessica Biel) and the obstacles they face with their star-crossed love. One of the best performances in the film, comes from Paul Giametti who plays a police inspector whom at the bequest of the crown Prince is hot on the tail of the Illusionist. His job is to try and discredit the young magician and defame him because he is not only a rival to the prince but is also able to command such a strong attention of the country's people (something the crown prince is wary of). When the death of Sophie(Biel) rouses suspicion, a game of cat and mouse ensues in the quest to figure out whether the illusionist can reveal her killer. But be mindful of everything you see during the course of the film, as a key clue to the ending plays out within thirty minutes into the film."

","to be honest, i only picked up this DVD at my local public library because i found out jessica biel was in it. if it was not for her, i probably would not have given the film a second look. i always felt that biel was one of the hottest stars in Hollywood right now and always looked forward to more work from her.<br/><br/>with that said, i was pleasantly surprised that this film was not all that bad (or at least as bad as i have heard other people say) and my friend grew quite fond of the film as well. the beginning was quite slow in the introduction when we meet the younger versions of edward norton's and jessica biel's characters but eventually picks up as they get older. the plot is i interesting enough to keep you watching and i felt that the acting was pretty good.<br/><br/>being that i picked up this film just for jessica biel, i was quite upset because of her early death in the film, but with this film being called ""the illusionist,"" you don't really believe anything you see in this film at first which makes the plot somewhat confused. the ending may be a twist if you think if it that way. at the end, the inspector ""finds"" out what really happened to jessica biel's character, but the way the final scene is portrayed you don't really know if this is the truth or if this is the way the inspector himself is portraying it. as the audience, you never really find out the truth and it is really left to the imagination. therefore, i decided to watch the final scene with the director's audio commentary on and he gave information you probably already know, but he gave a pretty interesting description of the movie, which i will paraphrase here because i forgot the actual quote. he stated that the whole film is about the audience's perception of things so therefore the outcome of the film is different to everyone that watches it which makes the plot so much more interesting....this is definitely a film with a very involved and deep plot and it definitely deserves a second viewing in order to understand everything..."

","Welcome to a world where nothing is what it seems. Welcome to a world where anything is possible. In short, welcome to turn-of-the-20th-century Vienna. In an era of vivid imagination and an unwavering enthusiasm for making the impossible happen, the stage magician is king. Eduard Abramovich, aka Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton, 'Fight Club'), is considered perhaps the greatest of them all, capable of numerous sensational magical tricks beyond belief; illusions so remarkably convincing that the audience truly believes that what they are watching is ""real magic.""<br/><br/>But, as we knew they must, Eisenheim's miraculous exploits have acquired him an enemy, and a powerful one at that. Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, 'Dark City'), who considers himself a rational man, finds himself utterly baffled by the magician's tricks, and he promptly orders for Eisenheim's performances to be shut down. To add more complications to their frictional relationship, Leopold has plans to marry Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), who was Eisenheim's childhood lover, though class restrictions tore their relationship apart. Meanwhile, Chief Inspector Walter Uhl (Paul Giamatti, 'Cinderella Man') does his best to uncover the mystery surrounding this enigmatic performer.<br/><br/>The year 2006 brought with it two exemplary examples of riveting film-making, both, curiously enough, concerning magicians in turn-of-the-century Europe. Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' premiered on October 17 to immense commercial and critical acclaim, amazing its audiences with a superb acting cast, brilliant art direction and a complex and twisting story of magician rivalry that had everybody talking for hours after the credits had rolled. Neil Burger's somewhat less publicised 'The Illusionist' had premiered on April 27 at the Newport Beach Film Festival, followed by a limited release that was later expanded. Having now seen both films, it is my absolute pleasure to declare that neither of these films appear to have been produced merely to profit in the other's wake  both films tell distinctly separate stories in different ways, and, above all else, both are fantastic cinematic accomplishments.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice about 'The Illusionist' is how beautiful it looks. Dick Pope's Oscar-nominated cinematography brilliantly evokes time and place. Filmed with a brownish hue, with faded edges and employing old-fashioned iris wipes, the film even somehow manages to look as though it was filmed one hundred years ago. Composer Phillip Glass' soundtrack, likewise, is haunting and beautiful.<br/><br/>In order for the story to have maintained its credibility, solid acting was a necessity, and the cast does not disappoint. Edward Norton lends his character  a man of few words  a suitably mysterious aura. Eisenheim is a man who is always in control, regardless of whether his ""magic"" is genuine or not. Paul Giamatti is brilliant as Inspector Uhl, a man conflicted by his loyalties to Crown Price Leopold, and similarly entranced by Eisenheim's elaborate illusions. Rufus Sewell is convincingly unlikable as the corrupt Leopold, who is frustrated and embarrassed by his inability to decipher Eisenheim's magic, and so commits himself to destroying the magician's art. Jessica Biel is elegant and beautiful as Sophie, a strong-willed woman who lends a certain softness to the screen.<br/><br/>'The Illusionist' was adapted from Steven Millhauser's short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist,' and Norton's character was loosely based upon a real-life 19th century magician, Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin (1805-1871). During my research, I was fascinated to discover that the ""orange tree"" illusion depicted in the film was, in fact, performed by Robert-Houdin during the 1800s. This remarkable illusion was an automaton, controlled by pedals and wires. In the original magic trick, in order to create the deception that the orange tree was blooming, genuine oranges were driven in points and remained hidden by foliage with spread open at the required moment. Flowers were concealed in small tubes, and became visible at the activation of a pedal. The illusion of flying butterflies carrying a handkerchief between them was accomplished using artificial insects mounted on invisible steel wires.<br/><br/>Part of the charm of 'The Illusionist' is that it doesn't really take the time to explain how the various illusions were achieved, or even if they were, in fact, illusions, and not real magic. The film leaves the ultimate decision to the audience, which, if you ask me, is treating us with considerably more respect for our intelligence than many other films often do. Magical, beautiful, memorable here are three words that still don't quite do this film justice."
"MaxBorg89","8","0","0","15 April 2007"," A fascinating period piece, with added value coming from Norton and Giamatti
","Given the proximity in release dates, it's hard not to start comparing Neil Burger's The Illusionist and Chris Nolan's The Prestige: after all, both are based on novels, deal with magic and have the same key theme (the contrast between illusion and reality); unlike The Prestige, however, The Illusionist is a more cerebral thriller-cum-romance, every single event having a reasonable explanation.<br/><br/>At the center of these events we find the enigmatic Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a very talented magician who earns his living by entertaining early 20th century Vienna. Very little is known of his past, but then again that doesn't matter: what people really want to know is how he manages the impossible, like making an orange tree grow on stage or even, in the film's eeriest scenes, summon the dead. Particularly eager to prove everything has to be a trick is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), who is intrigued and at the same time scared by the reclusive illusionist. What starts as intellectual duel between the two becomes something more complex when Eisenheim meets the arrogant Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and realizes the latter's fiancée, Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), is his lost childhood love. Old sparks reignite, and all of a sudden the story moves in a more suspenseful direction, the magician being forced to come up with something extraordinary to save Sophie from the cruel prince before it's too late.<br/><br/>And extraordinary things do indeed happen, as the director flawlessly uses everything he has (especially Dick Pope's Oscar-nominated cinematography and Philip Glass' stylish score) to provide the correct atmosphere of intrigue and mystery. In achieving this a major contribution also comes from the performances, Norton's elusive charm being the perfect counterbalance to Giamatti's cold rationalism. In fact, it is whenever the two are apart that the picture starts to feel a little lifeless: while Biel's work improves considerably in the second half of the film (a little bit ironic, actually: you will understand why once you have seen it), Sewell's one-dimensional pantomime is so annoying it becomes difficult not to wait for something bad to happen to him. Which brings me to the other weakness in an otherwise riveting piece of art: the ending. I mentioned earlier on that The Illusionist's climax provided a plausible explanation regarding every ""trick"" seen in the film. Unfortunately, said explanation also comes and goes so fast (forgive the expression) it might irritate more than please.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is one of the most interesting movies to have come out recently. Just sit down, watch and let Eisenheim fool you. It should be a rewarding experience."

","With a superb cast such as Norton and Giamatti, and a sprinkling of rave reviews from friends, I was expecting to see a film that would impress. What I got however was something far from a masterpiece and nowhere near the class that was 'The Prestige' which deals with a similar subject matter.<br/><br/>So what was good? In a word, nothing. Norton did nothing to endear the audience to his character, in fact he was quite 'bland', which is disappointing as he has done some fabulous turns in other films. Giamatti gave a more solid performance, but tended to overact in parts and his face in the last scene was priceless! Biel did well as the elegant Princess Sophie, but she wasn't really around long enough for her character to actually do anything. In fact the best performance came from Sewell who made a convincing baddie that we all love to hate (but then he's done this before in 'A Knight's Tale' hasn't he?). Coupled with the poor acting the characters were just not strong enough.<br/><br/>Then there was the plot. For me, the major problem in the whole film was the twist and my reasoning is this.. I am the last person to figure out twists, and when they happen I am normally stunned, shocked and confused - ""how did I miss it??"" This makes me the perfect person to watch mystery style films as I will always give the desired outcome. ""Why is this a problem?"" you ask. The problem is that I SAW THIS TWIST COMING A MILE OFF!!! Which meant for the rest of the film I was simply waiting for the answer to be revealed. <br/><br/>And it was revealed... in a 'here's how it was all done' fashion, which when the likes of me can see the twist, it is slightly patronising to then reveal it in this way. In fact, had they had skipped this over-dramatised, ""look how clever we are"" scene, I could have been almost to my car and on my way home!"

","Each year, an underdog movie proves to be very successful and critically acclaimed. This year the post was covered by The Illusionist, a beautiful period romance with enough suspense and mystery to give The Prestige a run for its money.<br/><br/>Young Edward has abnormal powers and is a gifted illusionist. He begins a relationship with a noble young girl Sophie, but their relationship is forbidden, and when they are discovered they are forced never to see each other again. Many years later, Edward returns to Vienna for a performance, where he meets Sophie once again. She is about to marry the heir to the throne, but her love for Edward is too strong, forcing her to plan an escape to run away with Edward.<br/><br/>Being a low-budget picture, the performances are somewhat vital and The Illusionist easily suits this criteria. As Edward, Edward Norton gives a remarkably touching performance, aided by Jessica Biel, who swaps beauty for tears, in a role which gives the film credibility and emotion. Paul Giamatti has once again been overlooked by many critics in a role which he deals with in an excellent, if not perfect, manner. Another role which is very important is that of Rupert Everett as the Prince. He can switch from sneaky to menacing in a second and he brings terror to the light, Somehow, apart from these characters, others have no significant importance devoting the story to them.<br/><br/>Unlike many other movies, this manages to keep you on the edge of your seat without making use of any amazing special effects. When Eisenheim (Edward), is aided by Sophie to perform the mirror trick, the simple yet haunting red cloak makes the trick visually unforgettable; a risk any other blockbuster movie, The Prestige, would've unlikely taken. Nevertheless, if you don't think that simplicity is an asset, I advise you to steer clear from this picture.<br/><br/>As for the story, based on a short novel, it is unexpectedly smart, and whilst the audience may work out the enigma, which is thankfully credible. The suspense is incredible, and whilst the audience is nearly always prepared for what is about to happen, you can still feel a gnawing sensation in your stomach. However, I advise you not to try and work the mystery out, as you shall probably be disappointed by the sudden twists.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>A beautiful and captivating romantic mystery from start to finish. Definitely one of this year's hidden gem."

I suppose walking away with a little mystery sometimes isn't a bad thing. But in this case, it felt like I didn't get the answers promised or expected.

The cinematographer went up for an Academy, and it was deserved, I say.<br/><br/>Beautiful to watch, with actors that can hold up under pressure. I don't want to get into the story, but its good, a bit of a new twist on an old tale.<br/><br/>Rent it, Watch it, Then Rent The Prestige. It's fun that way. My girlfriend liked it. Enough said."

","Adapted from a short story by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Steven Millhauser, this is the kind of accomplished and classily-shot but understated movie that I suspect more people will see on DVD and television than at the cinema. Essentially it is a passionate love story, set in the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the late 19th century, between the eponymous magic man Eisenhaum (Edward Norton) and the beautiful and aristocratic Sophie (Jessica Biel). Attempting to block such a union is the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and his intelligent police inspector Uhl (an able performance from Paul Giamatti).<br/><br/>The illusions are integral to both the look and narrative of the film and the great illusionist Ricky Jay was technical adviser on the work by director Neil Burger, as he was on the recently-released movie ""The Prestige"" (directed by Christopher Nolan). Since I know the Czech Republic so well, I was almost distracted by the wonderful locations of Prague, Tabor and Cesky Krumlov, while Dick Pope obtained an Academy Award nomination for his wonderful cinematography. Meanwhile the score from Philip Glass, while not as compelling as that for ""The Hours"" is not as intrusive as that for ""Notes On A Scandal""."

","SPOILERS:<br/><br/>This is the kind of picture to just get lost in. I found this movie utterly captivating. So far I have liked every film I've ever seen Ed Norton in. This one is no different and maybe my favorite. From beginning to end The Illusionist is completely and utterly enthralling.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent. Ed Norton was the perfect choice to play The Illusionist. Giamotti was superb. I didn't see this before the Academy awards but now that I have I can't believe none of the performers were at least nominated. They were that good.<br/><br/>The visuals were magnificent, visually stunning. The magic and how it was used was fascinating to watch and done beautifully. And what a musical score! It was as captivatingly lovely as the imagery and fit perfectly. This movie reminded me of an old style Hollywood film, the kind of thing that one doesn't see a lot of anymore. The constant feeling of mystery, combined with the lush visuals, compelling story and fine acting came together in a movie that was exceptional. I adored it. It's rare that a movie can be this powerfully engrossing within the first few minutes but it is. Definitely one that should have received more recognition.<br/><br/>There were several ""twists' and all were done really well. I did not predict the end ""twist""....and I am usually pretty good with that type of thing. Oh Yeah I had figured the two lovers would be together but I thought he'd either bring her back to life or he would die as well as her. It never occurred to me she was still alive. I thought the twist was brilliant and the end really wowed me. I know twists in movies are pretty standard fare now but this one still managed to surprise....a lot.<br/><br/>As mentioned Norton was superb. And Biel, in her rather small role as the duchess was very good. The love story was very believable. Giamotti was amazing. I can't believe this is the same guy from 'Sideways"". That's why they call it acting I guess. This guy really needs to win an Oscar.<br/><br/>I can't say this was perfect because there was one thing that bothered me and that was the suicide scene. I didn't think that needed to be there and was not necessary to the story. But putting that one point aside, I found this tale of love, mystery and magic to be enthralling and a wonderful addition to the great movies of this past year and absolutely top notch in every way. It's a must see for fans of period films, romances, Ed Norton and Paul Giamotti fans or fans of magic."
"nobbytatoes","4","0","0","3 March 2007"," no spark of magic
","Magic has always been captivating. The impossible made real, yet with the ever lingering knowledge that it's all a trick. As the old saying, 'nothing is what it seems', something grand only occurred through the simplest effect. Nothing is what it seems is director Neil Burger's aim for The Illusionist, for magic is his smoke and mirrors surrounding what is simply a love story. Situated around Vienna towards the turn of the twentieth century, illusionist Eisenheim has propelled himself as a famous magician, with many claiming he holds supernatural powers. During one of his shows, Eisenheim discovers his childhood love Sophie is betrothed to Prince Leopold. Both wanting to rekindle their love, Eisenheim becomes investigated by Inspector Uhl, by Leopold.<br/><br/>The Illusionist walks a line of reality and fantasy, where the magic of the impossible enters reality. The illusions presented while gasping one second lose credibility. The Illusionist grounds itself in reality, though it's illusions run in a realm of fantasy. Suspension of disbelief may be the ultimate trick for this film, but lack of revelations stunt this from happening, for the illusions are deemed impossible for this point in history. It's a brave move on Burger's part, keeping answers locked away on the workings of Eisenheim's tricks, his exercise in the slow burn pace to find your own answers in the surrounding details, which will enthrall or irritate, lead to a conclusion with missing pieces. Burger's main concern is the love story.<br/><br/>While it's at the heart of The Illusionist, the romantic arc between Eisenheim and Sophie works best as a soap opera. Dull and no spark of romance, with a lack of chemistry between Norton and Biel. Norton walks around so wooden and stiff, Biel maybe in her best performance, lacks depth. Giamatti is flat as Inspector Uhl and Sewell is overly pompous and one dimensional as Leopold; his tyrant prince and wife hitter miss much subtlety. The all round flat performance are not helped either by Philip Glass's score, which constantly rubs against the grain, failing to inject any dramatic tension. Burger's directing rather heavy handedly, increases may of the awkward moments, though cinematography by Dick Pope makes for some visual intrigue, while the amber seeped into the visual mix tries to pound the note of a period theme to hard. <br/><br/>The Illusionist will captivate many, with too many lose ends floating around and flat performances, the magic surrounding The Illusionist is rather empty and non-captivating. Inspector Uhl sums The Illusionist up best, ""You Look Ordinary"". This is an ordinary affair."

","Many people might regard The Illusionist as a few months too late, well people in Britain anyway. You see The Illusionist has many similarities with last years The Prestige, both follow rivalries (albeit in a different sense), both surround magicians, or illusionists, both are period pieces, and both rely on a final real twist that are pretty tricky to guess. I saw The Prestige when it first came out and I absolutely loved it, superb performances, great directing, and of course the twist that absolutely blew me away. Now several months later, The Prestige's distant but all too similar cousin has arrived in all its glory. Now the trouble with this is that is draws out inevitable comparisons between the two movies. And unfortunately in terms of quality and entertainment The Prestige always wins over The Illusionist. However this is not to say that The Illusionist is not a good movie, actually quite the opposite in fact. The Illusionist is a superb movie, its just overshadowed a tiny bit by The Prestige.<br/><br/>Now then the good points of The Illusionist to start the proceedings. Well first and foremost the performances are absolutely brilliant. Edward Norton is a superb actor in my eyes, in fact in nearly everything he has made he has always delivered a great performance. In this movie Norton simply has to be very mysterious, and he pulls that off very well, but he also gives him a more human and subtle side to the character. The moments he spends with Jessica Biel's Sophie are truly brilliant. Jessica Biel delivers her best performance to date, not saying much as her other movies were rubbish, but in all seriousness she delivers a pretty good performance here. Paul Giamatti is on top form as usual, his character remaining the most interesting and human out of them all. He has some great comedy moments here and there and his curiosity for magic makes him all the better. But the big star here has got to be Rufus Sewell's lip curlingly evil Crown Prince. Sewell relishes in playing uptight aristocrats and here he delivers his most fun performance to date.<br/><br/>Another good point is the fact the actual plot and pacing for the movie is very well done. Many critics have complained that the middle section drags the film down a bit, it never bothered me whatsoever to be honest. The middle section worked very well and like the rest of the film is intricate to the finale. The movie also is directed in a very beautiful way, lit in a nice way and it also has a very good score that adds atmosphere and oomph to certain sequences. But my personal favourite thing about this movie are the actual magic shows. The opening show involving an orange tree and butterflies is mesmerising, yet later shows featuring a sword, a painting and something that I can't say as it'll spoil the movie, the shows just get better and better. And just like the audience you will sit and wonder how he actually does it. Which of course leads onto the twist.<br/><br/>Now then, the twist is what sort of made my love for this movie slip slightly. The twist is nowhere near as good as it was in The Prestige. The Prestige did something witty and inventive, and also very unpredictable. The trouble with this movies twist is that it never really amazed me. Its actually quite simple to figure out if you pay attention to the movie very closely. It works and rounds off the movie very nicely, yet it never feels right. I just wanted something else to happen, something more mysterious. Another problem is the fact that the movie chooses not to explain everything. This frustrated me as it explained certain events and other events they simply ignored. Leaving the audience more confused than anything else.<br/><br/>However, these two bad points do not make The Illusionist anything less than a great movie. It might not appeal to everyone, some might find it a bit too slow for their liking. But if you do like this sort of thing I do highly recommend it. Don't go in expecting it to be exactly like The Prestige as it isn't, but don't expect it to be better than The Prestige either as once again it isn't. But it has great performances, great directing and just a great plot."

","I've been looking at the first few comments on this and it seems clear that they are the work of 1) the easily satisfied and/or 2) people who are not regular movie-goers or readers of mainstream fiction and thus have no knowledge of The Prestige, The Princess Bride or Carter The Great, all three of which touch on/explore the same themes as The Illusionist. Even an unsophisticated kid watching a movie in the forties or fifties knew that if one of the two leads was killed off halfway through it had to be a scam (though they would have said 'trick' or 'ruse' in those days) so how anyone in the 2Ist century can accept the death at face value is beyond me.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the setting but for me this was a major disappointment; we tend to associate Vienna, especially fin-de-siecle Vienna with opulence and glamor yet this whole film was shot with a touching concern for the light bill so that even the few scenes in daylight were somehow gloomy. Apart from the illusion factor the most interesting thing was the cat-and-mouse between Norton and Giametti with the latter turning in the best performance by a mile. All too often Sewell was reduced to chewing the scenery like an anorexic Charles Laughton whilst Biehl is a graduate of the Scarlett Johannson School of Empty Chocolate-Box acting and failed miserably to generate even a spark of chemistry with Norton. This isn't the same as saying that the thing isn't watchable because it is, just about, but beware: You may wind up disillusioned."

","Let me first say that I had seen 'The Prestige' when it first came out, and was struck by how two so seemingly similar movies could come out at the same time...( like when a song called ""The Power"" came out in the early 90s to several artists.<br/><br/>Of course having seen the movie, the two have nothing in common. They are so different it is a shame to even compare them. That being said I consider both to be wonderful ways to spend a few hours.<br/><br/>I like Edward Norton..on a scale of 1 to 10, I like him about a 7, but he doesn't appeal to me nearly as much as Christian Bale, a supreme actor in my opinion; and although Hugh Jackman has done some stinker movies, when he is good he is really good.<br/><br/>Paul G. may not have had a perfect accent, his mannerisms certainly made up for it. Bravo to him, I love that guy.<br/><br/>The shooting in each is lovely, with a slight edge to The Prestige. The acting is great in each with a slight edge to The Prestige as well. Where this movie has a victory is ironically in it's simplicity. It is far more conventional a movie than The Prestige ( as one would expect given the directors ).<br/><br/>I think that although The Prestige will have a long lasting cult following, this movie will in the end get the most accolades due to it's accessibility-chronological plot, conventional romance sub-plot, etc.<br/><br/>Either way we all win. Both movies are great.<br/><br/>MAN NOTE - I give Scarlett the credit for a cute face, but Jessica is surely the more mature sexual woman :) BOTTOM LINE - This film 7.5/10 ( damn worth watching ) The Prestige 9/10 ( A must see in my humble opinion )"

And yet the entire story is based on them knowing each other and falling in love at age 12 or 13. They would have to BE the same age, right? Or maybe he's one year older, but no more than that.<br/><br/>Since Biel is in real life 12 or 13 years younger than Norton, it just made it even more unbelievable.

"FD-a","8","0","0","6 February 2007"," Double Misdirection Inversion of Justice
","The ILLUSIONIST seems like a simple romantic tale as long as you do not think to carefully about the plot. One of the few movies of late that has captured my constant interest from start to finish. Often when plots are boring or overworked I watch movies in reverse from back-to-front. It took me a while to figure out that this was a double misdirection. On the surface the movie has a happy ending which in this review I intend to give away in some detail. If you study the facts of the case, it appears a great criminal injustice was done, not to speak of the dissolution of a Royal household. More of that later.<br/><br/>The film captures the atmospherics of Wittingen's Vienna, the Hapsburg's ""double eagle"", strictly managed but quietly chaotic residual Holy Roman Empire. Creation of this essential primary illusion it is highly dependent on special effects. Much sepia-like yellow tint to imitate gaslight and early electrics. Details, sets, costumes and language are all pretty good. The granite monumental architecture is especially evocative of the time. Traffic on the streets consists of fine carriages broughams and dray wagons, no motorcars. As a missing piece of authentication I noticed neither street cleaners nor horse leavings on the fine brick streets. In the 1890s you'll need one or the other. I wonder if the special effects guys know how to visually simulate piles of horse deposits. <br/><br/>The trouble with mysteries revolving around magic or the supernatural is that the an inexplicable yet obvious ploy often gets explained away by powers out of the bounds of the physical universe. The trickery performed in ILLUSIONIST is largely unrevealed and defies even modern scientific plausibility. It is understood that the Illusionist Eisenheim (Iron-Home in German) is not a supernatural spiritualist and the movie only leads us to believe that souls return from the dead as a deception. But the film makers ultimately cannot resist cheating and credit Eisenheim with a kind of holographic engine not yet invented or even possible in 1895. Use of magic is an easy way out of constructing and solving a realistic puzzle. Puzzles, mysteries, complex turns of fate and scientific solutions are a mental calisthenics. Is the decline of difficult but rational plot creation, the failure to write complex but soluble mysteries, a sign of decline in literature? Is over dependence on magic and sci-fi (special effects in general) reflective of a lazy uneducated audience?<br/><br/>ILLUSIONIST hid the *MacGuffin* (secret sleeping potion) to the degree that it kept the audience guessing. The plot was a well executed misdirection in keeping with the first principle of stage conjuring. This was a fine romantic adventure with seeming happy ending and the good-guy gets the babe (a commoner wins the Duchess), Jessica Biel. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin<br/><br/>Now back to as yet undiscussed key element. There was a crime committed, and though detected by the police inspector at the very end, we can be certain it went unpunished. The subjective view of the protagonists is that evil was averted and good triumphed. However a careful review of the plot will expose the fact that this was an inversion of right and wrong and we can state clearly that the subversive self indulgent magician won at the cost of a major diplomatic and social transgression. Prince Leopold was innocent of the murder (there was no murder), and framed by Eisenheim. The moral ambiguity here may be an accidental reflection of the confused morality of the screen writers and director. This appears to be an exemplary instance of how a politically correct circumstantial case can be created to liquidate political opposition. Was there really any plot to overthrow the Emperor? Was this ""secret"" a fabrication of the magician contrived to eliminate his rival? The jewels and locket were obviously planted evidence. Was the subversion of a Royal marriage alliance really in the best interest of the people when it is a given that such conjunctions are made from higher diplomatic points of view with peace and economic stability as a major goal?<br/><br/>It is silly to make too much of a trivial romantic adventure, but I think it amusing and revealing to note that this movie is about a heinous crime perpetrated in the name of a childhood delusion of love. In today's world we might give it another name; stalking, false accusation (and suicide) of a rival and enticing (if not kidnapping) of an unsophisticated and rather sheltered young woman away from her family. Not just a ladies maid or minor cousin of a newly minted Baronet, but a Duchess no less. The political rank here (Duke-Duchess) is about the equivalent of a provincial Viceroy. That is, the Governor who rules and taxes a large region as proxy of the head of state. Not trivial. Can we say that the shallow political thought process of this filmmaker views anything like a structured monarchy as inherently evil, and feels justified to recommend any excess in disruption and amoral behavior?<br/><br/>I'll do my homework and read the originating story. Clever tale but the obvious outcome is only half the payload.<br/><br/>Indiana Bill"
"eschetic","7","0","0","4 February 2007"," Beautiful, engrossing film just misses full satisfaction
","The interesting, surprisingly effective casting of Norton, Giamatti and Biel in the title role, the police investigator and the lady involved with a prince (even, to a lesser extent, Sewell's slightly over the top crown prince) combine with outstanding cinematography and an atmospheric story to make a film that just misses being a quiet classic.<br/><br/>The fascinating tie of the original short story (and screenplay) to a period of European history once wildly over worked in popular theatre and literature - the Mayerling scandal - has enormous potential for reexamination. The story's (by then) married crown prince killed himself some years LATER at his hunting lodge at Mayerling for reasons which have never been adequately explained with a woman who may or may not have been his mistress. His successor in the position of heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire had his own tragic but passionate love story that culminated in the start of the First World War following his assassination on his 14th Wedding Anniversary (he had taken his Sophie away from the strict court protocol of Vienna to oversee maneuvers outside Serejevo as a romantic gesture for their anniversary).<br/><br/>None of this unfortunately is touched on in this lush, enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying film. Would that it were - rather than merely offering a simple, nicely told, but all too fictional special effects mystery/love story.<br/><br/>So much of the history we think we know comes from our popular entertainment (Shakespeare's RICHARD III is a rattling good thriller, but lousy history), it is more than arguable that writers on the page, stage or screen who take their settings and inspiration from our history have an active obligation to get as many of the FACTS right as possible. Ultimately, it even makes good commercial sense (how much longer would THE ILLUSIONIST have stayed in theatres with the added intrigue of knowledgeable audiences arguing if something like this could have been the reason Leopold ultimately killed himself!?).<br/><br/>Since both of the essential figures at the center of the film we were given were based on real people (the actual illusionist lived to be murdered by Nazis in the next century under Hitler's rule), how much we ought to wish that the writers had worked harder and woven their story closer to actual known events. It could have only enhanced the basic story they chose to tell.<br/><br/>The research as to the look and feel of the movie - as far as it went - is admirable, but there are distressing misconceptions in the director's commentary on the DVD. For the most part these are simply the misconceptions of a partially educated but bright - and very talented - 20th century film maker, but they contribute to the few weaknesses in the film itself.<br/><br/>Case in point: the director goes out of the way to point out that the scenes at the ""crown prince's estate"" were filmed at one of the actual estates of the eventual heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. It was, in fact, his hunting lodge (at a time when a royal hunting lodge was a palace), and the director remarks disapprovingly on the high ceilinged hall covered with the Archduke's hunting trophies. The director calls the hall ""horrifying"" and speculates that the ""bad karma"" of the ""thousands of slaughtered animals"" eventually caught up with the archduke when he himself was murdered. That analysis *might* seem apt for the heavyhanded (slightly psychopathic) Crown Prince Leopold the director is painting from a 21st century perspective, but IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ACTUAL ERA OF THE STORY, it would have marked the hunter - as it did our own Teddy Roosevelt who helped establish our National Park system - as a committed naturalist and the opposite of the image the director imagines.<br/><br/>This was a real opportunity missed, but a very enjoyable film for what is there. The screenplay keeps the audience guessing a little too long - one or two slightly more obvious clues earlier on would have paid off enormously later on in the satisfaction level. The unexpected depth of Norton and Giamatti's performances however finesse most problems of what one initially suspects are ""tricks"" more CGI ""sweetened"" than they may actually have been (if the director is to be believed).<br/><br/>Worth a look. For most of us, the biggest problem will be wanting a film we enjoyed to have been even better. It could have been."

An extremely believable script with a captivating plot line. The dialogue between Jessica Biel's Sophie and Ed Norton's Eisenheim though cheesy at times feel real and passionate. Burger intertwines the character's lives perfectly coming into a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Directing- 10/10 Thought Burger doesn't have the longest or most illustrious career he throws together a brilliant movie. He captures not only the should of his characters but he uses subtleties to hint at the outcome of the movie long before the conclusion, but keeps them extremely complicated.<br/><br/>Acting- 8/10 What can I say, this movie was beautifully casted. My only complaint has to be with Jessica Biel as at times she doesn't come off as the most convincing. Ed Nortong, Paul Giamatti, and Rufus Sewell all piece together the turmoil of their characters perfectly. The arrogance of Leopold (Sewell), the pain of Eisenheim (Norton) and the confusion of Uhl (Giamatti) are done to perfection.<br/><br/>Set/effects/costume- 8/10 Well I wouldn't exactly call this the movies downfall because it was all down pretty well but it's definitely the weak point of the film. The sets definitely felt authentic and appeared to fit into the setting of 1900 Vienna, as did the costumes. But the effects was where the weak points came. CGI can be hard to do in movies where its used rarely and this was the case in The Illusionist. A few scenes where Eisenheim is doing his shows you lose some of the believability factor due to the poor CGI.<br/><br/>SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!"

","One viewer already pointed out the one ""flaw"", weakness really, which is the lack of strength of relationship between Sophie & Eisenstein. Well they were close as youngsters and have been apart for, what? 15 years? Sort of hard to maintain a long-distance love for that long even these days. And don't criticize Giamatti for his strong role, for without his part where would the story lie? He is the one who acts in the Prince's stead to break up this relationship, and there lies the conflict. That viewer gave it a ""B"" yet only gave 6 stars? I clapped at the end, totally entertained by it all and what else do we want from our movie-going experience? Good all around!"

","I thought the movie was very well done and had great acting although I thought the story was somewhat predictable. However, I was puzzled about whether the prince actually thought he killed her in a drunken outrage, did he know Edward Norton's character was tricking everyone the whole time, or did he think that the random guy they arrested did it? They never really show his reaction to her death, I guess he was in Buda Pest the day after. It just seems like if he really thought Norton was tricking him, he would have investigated much furtherly before giving up on him. I know he tries to get Norton arrested but for deceiving people via magic a magic show not faking a death. Anyone have an answer? Bfell I just enjoy good movies"
"Rover209","9","0","0","7 October 2006"," ""The Illusionist"" is a good story told well
","Its refreshing to go to the movies and see a film with a good story that is told well. ""The Illusionist"" does not disappoint in providing an intriguing historical romp through Austria at the turn of the 19th century. Edward Norton sets the stage as the mysterious and intense title character, Eisenheim. His rival is none other than the Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Rufus Sewell's portrayal of Prince Leopold is delightfully dark & complex with simmering rage. Paul Giamatti gives the perfect balance as the Chief Inspector of the Vienna Police who must seek the truth of the mysteries that unfold. An interesting story with multiple levels and twists keeps the audience interest. Art direction and cinematography give a pleasant and nostalgic view of what once was, while special effects display what might be. Romance, history, intrigue, mystery and a bit of action provide something for everyone."

","Very enjoyable for what it set out to be; well played, beautifully shot, and with a plot that hustles you over the soft spots and makes it easy to suspend disbelief. It could have been so much better with a few minor tweaks.<br/><br/>Chief Inspector Uhl is the one thoroughly adult character, a man who thinks he is worldly wise because he has managed to get the most he can out of the system. Thanks to historical hindsight, we know he's not as shrewd as he thinks because he doesn't realize the system is doomed. All the other characters are from a teenage romantic comedy, even though they're in their late 20s or early 30s. Eisenheim/Abromowitz projects the burning resentment of a smart, talented guy who is told he'll never get what he deserves, including the girl of his dreams, because he isn't one of the right people. Duchess/Cheerleader Sophie is something of a blank slate; we don't have enough back story to understand what would make an aristocrat like her break out of her upbringing by even seeing the son of a (Jewish) cabinetmaker as an interesting human being. We just have to accept the nerd's fantasy that she'd be dazzled by his sheer talent and fall in love with him. Crown Prince Leopold is simply a stock character, the villainous macho jerk from a hundred teenage romantic comedies. In this triangle, class and sex appear to have the same relations in the Austro-Hungarian Empire as they do at John Hughes High, and The Illusionist is enjoyable as an elegant retelling of that old familiar plot.<br/><br/>---SPOILERS BELOW ---<br/><br/>It would have been a stronger movie if Leopold had been a less one-sided character. Take away the spiteful nastiness and make the Prince an intelligent, ambitious, aggressive man who can see that the empire he has inherited is collapsing and is desperate to make the thing work. Keep both Eisenheim's hatred of a society that has unjustly denied him his heart's desire and his need to destroy the man who symbolizes that society in order to get the happiness he deserves. Leave everything else in place. Instead of a mere happy ending, you get deeper overtones of tragedy.<br/><br/>It would also have been a stronger movie if the last scene had been left on the cutting room floor. Let Uhl figure out the illusion, only too late, but leave the audience guessing whether he was right or not.<br/><br/>Finally, there was one major logical flaw in the illusion of Sophie's death. She belongs to a prominent, powerful family who are Leopold's political allies. Even if she had the cooperation of the family doctor to bluff Uhl and the police out of examining her apparent corpse (and we don't know how she and Eisenheim got his help), how were her relatives tricked? In particular, what did the lover/conspirators do about the very public funeral the Duchess von Teschen would have received?"

","I gave it an 8 because of the quality of the film.... It is good, at times really good... but it is not a GREAT film.<br/><br/>But it is sooo romantic and it is so surprising, so unexpected, intriguing yet puzzling.<br/><br/>I don't want to write much more than that because anything more would give something away. And the whole premise of the film is captured in its title: Illusion.<br/><br/>Other posters give a description of the film... I will just say it is visually stunning and amazingly acted. Paul Giamatti plays such a convincing personality that is completely different from his other roles: he is wise, calm, filled with good will in a job that both elevates his character while simultaneously forces him to be subservient. One would like such a character as he plays to be in a position of authority.<br/><br/>Ed Norton is always convincing though in a role that is not wholly believable but very engaging and entertaining. Jessica Biel is an incredible vision of loveliness, which is her prime purpose on the screen. But she executes that deftly and intelligently. It is the limitations of these two characters that prevent the film from being higher than an 8 in my mind. But that doesn't mean I didn't love the film. A film does not necessarily have to be great to be thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>So if you relax and allow yourself to be swept away by the tenor of the film, you will come away quite satisfied."

","Its so nice to see American actors acting superbly. The best kind of film. So a big fat middle finger to all the blinkered casting directors who cast so many mediocre English actors in American films. (Particularly applies to the casting of Pirates2.) <br/><br/>The lighting in this film is absolutely amazing. Basically there's a big oval of yellow light that hogs the centre of most scenes and the actors do their thing around its periphery. So, so clever and effective. It makes the film seem like it was made in the 1800s.<br/><br/>The Illusionist is a costume drama. I'm not sure about the plot...would a duchess really give up her privileged position to go live in a farmhouse in a field somewhere with the son of a cabinet maker. Well the answer is yes if she loves horses which she obviously does.<br/><br/>The music is also good but I like the music to most films anyway. I say this again. Norton and Giametti are totally excellent in this film. Norton never overacts as far as I can tell.<br/><br/>Poor Crown Prince. He was completely correct. A man undone by gossip and a sense of honour which is something Eisenheim certainly doesn't have. <br/><br/>In fact the Illusionist is a great deal more ruthless than the Crown Prince. And that really is the only flaw in the story."

","Hey yesterday we were hopping shopping around and in the hopping process landed in the nearby AMC and chose to watch Illusionist from the pithy list of remaining late night shows. We went without much homework on the movie and enjoyed it a lot!! I mean, with due respect to anyone who has to state otherwise, the simplicity of the movie was overwhelming. Wedid want to see magic or illusions, but must say what We got was worth any ticket's money!! The setting was sophisticated and captivating; the movie was beautifully colored and the performance of Eisenheim (played by Edward Norton) totally convincing. No action here, yet substance. No special effects, yet mesmerizing...One wanted to hate the Crown Prince (played by Rufus Sewell) and one wanted that the Police Inspector (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti) never arrest Eisenheim. So, in essence the screenplay lived upto the grandeur of the setting. On a breezy late night, don't go without high expectations, and this movie will enchant you, will make you laugh and smile in the climax!! Good Work......must watch if you want to relax and get some good stuff too!! and that too, totally beautiful, totally colorful, totally intelligent!!

"DonFishies","8","0","0","5 September 2006"," A gorgeous looking film with magnificent performances from Norton and Giamatti
","I had only heard of it as being a film from Sundance, but after some positive word of mouth got around, The Illusionist started making its way around theatres. It found its way to a theatre near me, and having seen everything else that was actually worth seeing, I gave it a shot. While it is not perfect at all, I still was fairly impressed by it.<br/><br/>Set in Vienna circa 1900s, Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) has arrested Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a local magician who practically rakes in the cash from everyone in Vienna coming out to see him. As it turns out, Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) is not to impressed with him for a number of reasons, not withstanding his love for Leopold's fiancée Sophie (Jessica Biel). After the arrest, Uhl spends the rest of the film telling Leopold the story of Eisenheim and how he managed to find himself in the predicament the film starts him out in.<br/><br/>The description may sound interesting, but the way the film plays out is not. Nothing exciting or particularly thrilling really happens at all within the storyline, and unfortunately, once it starts getting going, it becomes a little bit too predictable. Do not fret though, besides ending on a note similar to a critically acclaimed 1990's film, the film still holds a few surprises for the viewer. I understand that it was adapted from a short story and made a whole lot longer, but the film could have really used a whole lot of extra padding. It is not that the film is boring, it just does not really make itself out to be an attention grabber.<br/><br/>Of course, this is all that can be found ""wrong"" with the film, as everything else is excellent.<br/><br/>The film itself looks like a piece of art. The art direction and cinematography really allow this film to believably recreate the early 1900s, and it looks gorgeous. You can almost see the fine brush strokes. It really plays off on the atmosphere of the film at the time, and deviates accordingly. When the film is happy for its short time, the colours are warm and bright. When the film gets dark and moody, the colours become drab and shadow-like. Scenes in the darkened theatres are of particular interest, as are some of the outdoors scenes. The childhood flashback scenes, with the watered down colours and scratchy picture quality really impressed me, and really stood out in the film. Continually doing transitions with the circle wipes either closing or opening up the image got annoying very fast though. The score and special effects used to showcase Eisenheim's illusions are also quite majestic and well done as well.<br/><br/>The acting, even with the iffy accents and bizarre facial hair, is very well done from the three chief male players. <br/><br/>Norton continues with being a great performer, and while it is not as strong as his work in the likes of American History X, Fight Club or The 25th Hour (which I have yet to watch in its entirety), it is still very strong. There are a few moments within the film where he is just gazing right into the camera, and doing nothing else. While some actors may completely ruin scenes like these, Norton relishes in it. His expression, his body language and demeanor, everything about him is perfect. All you can think about is how strong of an enigmatic presence he has on screen, and how his performing skills have yet to wither.<br/><br/>While his choice of work is not always great, Sewell plays his role of the conniving Leopold quite well. Not as strong as Norton, but much better than Biel, who ends up not only being useless eye candy, but useless altogether. She has little to no chemistry with anyone on the screen (least of all Norton), and just feels like a totally wasted character (even though she is so important to the story). A better choice of actress could have only helped this performance actually be worth anything in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>But of course, I must contend that the standout performance is from Giamatti. The recent Oscar nominee practically chews a hole right through the scenery and the screen as Uhl. We are never too sure whose side he is playing on, and Giamatti has just enough charisma and energy to pull this supporting role off magnificently. He steals every scene away from everyone on screen (including Norton), to the point that his smoldering presence on screen is enough for the price of admission alone. This role yet again proves why he is one of the hardest working and best character actors in the business, and shows that he is not a one-trick pony at all.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is worth it for the great way the film looks and the excellent performances from Norton and Giamatti. Go to see those things, and you will not come away disappointed.<br/><br/>8/10."

"orsino44","8","0","0","5 September 2006"," a classy entertainment worthy of golden age Hollywood
","The Illusionist is a throwback to the sort of film one could regularly expect in Hollywood's golden age, say from 1930 to 1960. The performances are excellent, the magic effects well done, and the production design nothing short of sumptuous. Edward Norton, Jessica Biehl and Rufus Sewell as the magician, the duchess and the crown prince, are the players in a love triangle observed through the eyes of a police inspector(Paul Giamatti). One reason I thoroughly enjoyed this film is that its design elements bear a strong resemblance to one of my favorite films, The Prisoner of Zenda. The illusionist incorporates elements from both classic versions of PoZ, the 1937 Ronald Colman gem, and the 1952 remake with Stewart Granger. It's quite easy to imagine Granger, Deborah Kerr, Lewis Calhern and Robert Douglas in the lead roles in the Illusionist, and that is meant as a compliment to Norton/Biehl/Giamatti/Sewell. Many of the costumes and background characters are lifted directly from Zenda (check out the railway attendant at the end of the Illusionist and the railway customs man at the beginning of Granger's Zenda.) Even the rare Montenegrin Gasser revolver from PoZ 1937 makes an appearance. And when was the last time we saw an iris open and close in a contemporary film? Star Wars? Even the cinematography evokes old Hollywood. Throw in a good plot twist, a supporting actor who is the spitting image of Laurence Olivier, and some of the classic magic tricks of the era (Eisenheim opens his first show with Robert-Houdin's the Orange Tree) and you have a winner! A wonderfully romantic picture and highly recommended."

But it was the acting that really made this movie work for me. Ed Norton, Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel all made this a wonderful turn of the century piece.

"Usal","9","0","0","28 August 2006"," How rare to find such a gem of a movie.
","Based in Vienna at the turn-of-the century, the Illusionist is based on the story of a magician's love for a woman. Directer Neil Burger succeeds in taking us back to a time when birth was position, freedom of speech was treason, to be a magician was to be supernatural, and love had boundaries. This well edited and flowing story takes us into the mind and world of the individuals at play, as they each work to achieve their ultimate goals. Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti both put in very convincing performances, as the illusionist Eisenheim, and Chief Inspector Uhl respectively. Until now I have not rated Mr. Giamatti as a gifted actor. I was clearly wrong, as he may well have stole the movie, though their performances complemented one another well. Rufus Sewell plays Crown Prince Leopold, with Jessica Biel as Countess Sophie. I found Rufus very convincing in his role as the aristocratic emperor to be, with Ms. Biel being competent as the love interest. Beautiful location, subtle soundtrack and successful chemistry between the main players, make this a successful adult fairytale."

","first off, fantastically compelling film, if a little full of itself (though it has the right to be), a truly GOOD big Hollywood picture.

Anyways, i read a review in Elle magazine that said the director wanted it to be like the real illusionists and used NO COMPUTER GRAPHICS, only the real things enhanced by the camera. how did they do things like the hand passing through the little boy and the orange tree and the things floating in the air if not with high tech computer graphics???"
"NJMoon","4","6","20","1 September 2006"," Now You See Me, Now You Don't
","Let's get this straight, I NEVER leave a movie before the end. That is, until now. There is something oppressively dull about THE ILLUSIONIST, despite the inviting trappings of a period mystery set around magic featuring some very fine performers. What more could one ask of an end-of-summer flick, right? Well, how about some sense of pacing and style. This film is so desperately quiet, I had trouble staying awake in a mid-day matinée! It is more than an hour in before someone raises their voice above a hushed stage whisper. The pauses would put Harold Pinter to shame. You could literally drive a 'horse drawn carriage' through them. Giamatti and Norton are fine performers, but whatever nuance they bring to the film is lost amid detailed shots of 19th century streets and buildings. I felt like I was being smothered by down pillows and fled the cinema after nearly 90 minutes, gulping fresh air by the mouthfuls. What happens at the end? I couldn't care less. Where is Doug Henning when you need him?"
"ramesh_k9","4","3","8","10 January 2007"," Somewhat disappointing
","Because of all the hype about this movie, I eagerly looked forward to viewing it. But when I did it, I was disappointed. Why Eisenheim doesn't perform believable magic? By that I mean the kind of magic that is performed by the best of them. He creates virtual reality without the modern gadgets like computer, software, laser etc. Is there any record of such an illusion having been created (without these modern props) anywhere at anytime in the history? The way the character has been depicted, he is no mere illusionist; but someone with supernatural powers. It is difficult for anyone who is not staunchly religious to accept it. Acting by the principal characters is good. I particularly liked the work of Rufus Sewell, as he had to flesh out an underdeveloped, unsympathetic character. Strangely, he manages to imbue it with certain amount of dignity. Ms. Biel looks ravishing. <br/><br/>Police chief, when he gleefully unravels the plot, doesn't even care that he has been responsible for the death of an innocent man. In my view, it is a morally and intellectually ambiguous work."
"johnnymonsarrat","6","3","8","19 August 2006"," Jon Monsarrat review: nice mystery, but lacking stage magic!
","The Illusionist is a well-crafted, well-acted romantic drama, that may teach you a little about history. There are some great plot twists, and even though I saw the end coming it was still satisfying. After a stuttering start (too much narration, which is ""tell"", and they always say ""show, don't tell"", right?) the film is very engaging. As usual Edward Norton is fantastic. He is spooky and mysterious, but not too aloof for you to empathize with the Illusionist. He'll win an Oscar one day for sure.<br/><br/>I would gladly have given the film an 8 out of 10, but I am settling for 6 for the following reason: there's no prestidigitation in the film. Almost every effect is done with computer graphics, which left me so disappointed. If only they'd started the movie saying something like ""all illusions in this film were recorded without the use of camera tricks or graphics of any kind,"" they would not have had to modify the script and it would have had such a higher impact.<br/><br/>Instead, I have to confess that I found myself sitting there thinking, sarcastically, wow, computer graphics, like I've never seen that before. Some actual sleight of hand would have impressed me. I think the cruel fact though is that circa 1890 the true-to-life craftsmanship and technology of that era would simply not have supported illusions that would compete with our 21st century sensibilities. So perhaps they considered that route and discarded it.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to confess that I don't understand the success of Paul Giamatti. I guess there must be a lot of people out there who like him, but I find that he's too much of a big huggy bear to play a tough guy like his supporting role in this film.<br/><br/>Who should see this movie:<br/><br/>-- Mystery film lovers, skip it unless you're big into romance. Guys, this is a safe film to let your girlfriend drag you to. It's not syrupy.<br/><br/>-- Amateur magicians, you will be disappointed to find no sleight of hand in the film, although I've heard that Ricky Jay was somehow involved.<br/><br/>-- Megalomaniac princes with false-looking mustaches I'll give The Illusionist a near-miss 6 out of 10."

Norton just looked like a crazy guy, like he always does in his movies, and Jessica Biel like a countess, like she always does.

BORING... let's think of something new for a change and stop regurgitating the same bagel to be digested over and over again.

Also, I'm just randomly remembering a part at the end where the guard sees the woman on horseback all slumped over as if she were dead, and lets her pass anyways without following her. Really?<br/><br/>Ultimately, the whole story felt contrived and unrealistic. The magician comes back home and happens to be reunited onstage with the love of his pre-pubescent life... and they both fall in love again... and she happens to be engaged to the most evil and powerful man in the kingdom... and this evil man also happens to have a keen interest in magic and wants to destroy the magician.

","In a movie about misdirection, the opulent production design, set decoration and sumptuous cinematography of *The Illusionist* serves to misdirect the audience into believing that there is something more profound at stake than the Getting of Panty.<br/><br/>I can pinpoint exactly where *The Illusionist* loses its footing: during afterglow, Eisenheim the Illusionist tells Duchess Sophie, ""The only mystery I couldn't solve was why my heart couldn't let go of you."" Quantum groan.<br/><br/>Up to that point the movie intimated it was about Eisenheim delving into occult knowledge, seeking forbidden illusions and tempting unholy fates, but with that George-Lucasoid line, it showed its hand  its objective was simply to reunite star-crossed lovers. Again: groan; simultaneously, pay less attention so manhood remains intact.<br/><br/>Originally a short story by Steven Millhauser (*Eisenheim the Illusionist*), written for the screen and directed by Neil Burger (only his second filmic offering), *The Illusionist* probably gave its hand away even earlier during gratuitous backstory, where our fledgling magician Hero  a lowly peasant boy at the time - was smitten by a young upper class girl whom he is forcefully separated from due to bigotry of the caste system - and dramatic foreshadowing.<br/><br/>Despite its overarching inanity, Burger scored big with two of the greatest actors in cinema today: Edward Norton (as Eisenheim) and Paul Giamatti (as Chief Inspector Uhl). Even so, Norton does not quite fill the aura of the master magician; his eye is not striking enough and his brow is not brooding enough; Rufus Sewell (who plays Crown Prince Leopold) has more of a commanding magician's look about him. Giamatti, on the other hand, burns down the screen with yet another chameleonic performance, astounding in its seamlessness and emphatic in its conflict  that of a man torn between supporting Eisenheim's cause and advancing his own career by unlawfully harassing Eisenheim at the petulant Crown Prince's behest.<br/><br/>Burger uses the passé technique of starting the story in the middle, telling it in flashback  which is the film's first half - and letting it ""catch up with itself"" in the middle, thereby distracting us more than misdirecting us, for there was no compelling reason to do so, other than to call attention to how smart he fancied himself for doing so.<br/><br/>Set in 1900 Vienna (with Philip Glass' soundtrack unmistakably evoking the period) we discover that the Crown Prince's betrothed, Duchess Sophie, (played with sensual style and bangin' buttocks by Jennifer Biel) is Eisenheim's love of his youth; accidentally re-discovering each other during one of Eisenheim's toast-of-the-town performances, she decides to flee the Prince and do the anonymous country girl shuffle with Eisenheim.<br/><br/>This sets in motion a chain of events that are not what they seem. At one point, the story seemed to thankfully violate Hollywood Romantic Protocol with the death of the Duchess  without the female love interest, the film would be forced to do something interesting through its third act  but, as we discover, this plot point is merely sleight of hand, all explained in a last-minute montage of crash-cuts straight out of *Ocean's Twelve.* Plot twists serve a movie best when they reveal something startling, but this movie's pretentiousness in speculating on Eisenheim's communing with the dead or overthrowing an empire belies its prosaic outcome  monogamy.<br/><br/>Eisenheim's stage tricks were all sleight-of-CGI, which was yet another distraction, as the illusions were too extreme. Since this tale is told through the eyes of Detective Uhl, Eisenheim could have just as easily presented ""real"" illusions, challenging enough to be considered supernatural by the virgin crowds of the day (as Arthur C. Clarke notes, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"") but in making them truly inexplicable (growing an orange tree in seconds, conjuring ghosts - attired in the couture of the period - walking through the audience), the movie leans on us to regard them as supernatural (as his audiences do). If so, then we must question the obvious: ""Do clothes have souls too?"" (Otherwise, why aren't the ghosts naked? Does the supernatural world respect the propriety of Victorian-morals Europe and employ ectoplasmic clothing mimicry?) The fact that this point is never raised with Eisenheim's 1900's audience may be construed as proof of their credulity or unsophistication  but think of all the years you in 2006 have been exposed to ghost stories and horror movies; ghosts are always wandering some Elizabethan hallway or haunting some teen model completely clothed  *you've* never considered this anomalous either! It is this unquestioning acceptance that religions rely on to keep humanity marginally retarded with fairy tales masquerading as history (but that's another essay) <br/><br/>Of course, the grandest illusion is that which our species perpetrates on itself - using ""love"" and ""romance"" to façade more earthy human proclivities. In a biological system geared towards the continuance of Life, procreation is nothing short of Life's Prime Directive. Mating is good. The Villains are the hypocrisy of ""love"" and ""romance."" *The Illusionist* glorifies these Villains morbidly.<br/><br/>Sophie and Eisenheim delude themselves that their ""love"" for each other justifies their atrocious framing of the Prince. Society seemingly advocates their premeditated crime, for when Inspector Uhl figures out the plot, rather than arrest Eisenheim for deviously driving a man to suicide, he simply laughs at Eisenheim's ingenuity (which involved slipping someone a mickey, faking a death, public slander, planting evidence  all crimes, even in 1900 Vienna) because Eisenheim ""did it for love"" of course.<br/><br/>*The Illusionist* worked its most egregious misdirection by invoking ""love"" (which in reality is nothing more than two evolved apes panting over each other's genitals) and making felonies look like family entertainment.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

","Was anyone else completely turned off to this film right at the beginning after noticing what little effort ANY of the actors put into their accents? I'm sorry, but no one sounded like they were born in Vienna. They all had these horribly overdone semi British accents where you just over pronounce every word to make it sound like you are speaking the dialect. I thought it was really pathetic, especially because Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are such great actors. There are language coaches in Hollywood, right? Or do filmmakers just not bother with that sort of thing anymore? Sorry, but it made the entire film unbelievable. <br/><br/>Beyond that, pretty much everything else in the movie disappointed me also. But my first and major complaint would have to be the accents."
"jaredmobarak","6","2","5","3 September 2006"," Where the dark arts still hold swayThe Illusionist
","There is a lot of buzz going around movie circles about this being the year of magic. With Christopher Nolan's The Prestige garnering much anticipation, the lesser-known The Illusionist, by director Neil Burger, hits screens first. Trailers show that while it appears to be the more accurate movie in terms of period and realism, it doesn't seem to have the flash or grave consequence as Nolan's film. While The Prestige is a movie about rivalry and mysticism, The Illusionist is a love story shrouded in trickery and class distinction. We are treated with realistic performances from all the principles, gorgeous cinematography and sleight of hand illusions, yet ultimately are shown a slight story that plods along while entertaining. It is a good film, well worth seeing, yet I have to say it just makes my interest in Nolan's new movie heighten.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is a son of a carpenter who worked on the house of a dignitary. This nobleman had a daughter, Sophie, who became smitten with Norton's character. The two want to run away, but their plans are thwarted, as usual in these types of plot lines, by the class disparity; no peasant can be with a noblewoman. We flash forward 15 or so years to Norton's return from exile as Eisenheim the Illusionist in Vienna. His tricks are top-notch and garner the attention of Chief Inspector Uhl, played nicely by Paul Giamatti as a peasant trying to make a name for himself, yet who still knows his role in society. He tells the Prince who comes to see it for himself. Of course the Prince's girlfriend is Sophie, all grown up, and she rediscovers the love that was taken from her once she sees her childhood friend on stage. The film then plays out to show the struggles between the prince and the pauper to see the strength of true love.<br/><br/>Norton and Giamatti are both stalwarts of their craft and here is no exception. I think the two actors to mention are Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell. Biel radiates beauty, yet hasn't really shown anything to warrant top-bill status as far as ability over stardom. As Sophie, she has an innocence and lack of class status that really proves her love for Norton. This isn't your normal wealthy woman who plays with those under her, she truly loves Eisenheim and has during all the years she lost living without him by her side. I was pleasantly surprised by her understated performance, she did what was needed, and maybe took a step in the right direction from fare like her role in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Sewell on the other hand, shows once more that he is vastly underrated. He plays villainous slime to perfection. The cold stare and palpable malice on his face at times creates true fear. Hopefully one day he will get a chance to shine like he did as the lead in the great Dark City.<br/><br/>The real beauty of small films like this is the ensemble casts and overall craftsmanship. Craft almost supersedes acting here, as good as that is itself. Visually, the opening titles are the best I can remember of those seen this year. The focus changing of the old silent film script font is a sight that really immerses the audience into the story. They create a mindframe that we are being transported into a time that has past, a time of real artistry and imagination. Even the early flashback is vignetted in a feathered-edge oval. The magic tricks also are shown realistically with few moments of fake cgi to take you out of the reality. I'm sure the consulting by magician Ricky Jay, a David Mamet stalwart and former castmember of Deadwood, has something to lend to this. It's just a shame that he couldn't crack the cast- list here to as he did with The Prestige.<br/><br/>It's too bad that with all of these great things, The Illusionist just didn't have it all. The story is at its core a simple love triangle with magic thrown in. Its almost two hour length seems a bit bloated during the middle portion and unfortunately brings the intrigue down with it. The ending is also obvious, yet because it is pushed so far back from view you almost second- guess the shear necessity of it until it finally happens. Although you know it's coming a mile away, the filmmakers so wanted it to surprise the audience that they wait until the last possible moment to spring it on you. Sadly, this tactic doesn't promote a sense of awe, but instead just makes it feel tacked on as though they couldn't find a way to seamlessly have it happen, so they just unraveled it all at once. It just left me with an empty feeling on an otherwise technically beautiful film."

","I was very disappointed after seeing the trailer and being a big Edward Norton fan to be presented with this rather mediocre piece. What could have been a rather enjoyable film if it had stayed on this side of the illusionist/spiritualist line became rather laughable when ghosts started appearing on stage (or even off stage in the case of the boy). The fun for me in this would have been if the _illusions_ had stayed at least plausible, *illusions*! For instance, the Orange Tree. Paul Giamatti, was, as expected, flawless (it does a heart good to see an interesting looking person for a change instead of variations on Ken & Barbi). The film looked fabulous and I thought it was a nice variation on American produced period films *not* to use Britain or America but Eastern Europe for its setting. However, all in all, I think Rod Serling would have been better able to present this plot in 50 minutes on an old Twilight Zone episode."

Caught between his admiration and duty. <br/><br/>I'd seen him in his early character actor roles, but I've been following his career closely since 'Sideways' where he proved he could carry a film as the lead.

"filipemanuelneto","9","1","2","5 August 2017"," Very pleasant, entertaining and well done.
","This film is a kind of romantic tale based on the seemingly impossible passion between a poor boy who becomes an illusionist and a rich girl who belongs to the highest aristocracy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Separated in their youth, they will be reunited years later, but she is engaged to the cruel Crown Prince. When she appears dead, the magician will do everything he can do for the Prince to be investigated.<br/><br/>The first thing I must say is a warning: this story is totally fiction, although it has been made on a historical background. The Austrian prince of this film never existed. Now let's continue... When I first started watching the movie I realized one thing: it's pleasant, entertaining and the main characters are good enough to make the public feel emotions about them. The audience will probably like the magician and the duchess but will also quickly feel angry for the prince. This mix of emotions links the audience more strongly to the screen and will hold their attention until the end. However, the ending was what surprised me the most, since I was hardly expecting anything more, but when the movie seems to be over, the final part truly begins. Edward Norton was quite convincing in the character of the impassioned illusionist, as well as Rufus Sewell and Paul Giamatti. Jessica Biel also looked good, although her character didn't have the same presence of the male cast. In short, this film is very interesting and is really well done. It undoubtedly deserves to be watched and I am sure it will please almost any audience."

","OK, I will not be setting any spoiler's in here. But, I do suggest watching it at least twice, due to the end, WILL cause you to believe, that you missed something! Now, on to the rest of it. This movie, I had not seen, due to it not getting it's ads, like so many, that was no where near as good, as this was! The plot is, a carpenter's son, that has a passion for being a magician. Then he fall's in-love with the duchess, as they are childhood friends. The settings are set, back in the early 1800's, where they are using those beautiful horse's and carriage's. That seem to set the mood, while watching the movie. The music in the background also helps. Pretty much everything comes together as a great movie! Edward Norton plays his character seamlessly, with his stare and so much more! Jessica Biel plays her character perfectly, as well. She set's the set, with her energetic personality, to find what she has been missing, for years. While, she feels she has to hide that energy, around certain people in the movie! But, the one that surprised me the most, was not the 2, that played the 2 main role's. But the man, who played the chief of police, which happens to have an enthusiasm in magic tricks and etc. Paul Giamatti plays his role, like I have never seen him play his role's! He also did his character perfectly! Rufus Sewell, play's his character, just as well as the other's did! I mean, they acted together, as a whole, not as separate parts. But, to inter-mesh them all together, to form one simple plot. But, with force behind it! The way they set the stage's up(The movie stage's and the character's stage's.), they set them, to seem, like they were from back in the early 1800's! I give props to not only the main cast. But the carpenter's & etc, that built the scene's! They all worked together, like their live's depended on it! The energy behind the whole movie, with the whole cast, is like they loved playing the character's and building the set's! I give this movie an easy 10, for their work on it! They did not use a ton of special effects, that did not go with the movie, like so many other producer's would love to do, just to spice-up the movie's. This movie has all the right special effect's, that does go with the movie! Now, I do suggest watching this movie at least 2 times. So, you can catch everything! Until you literally watch the ending, you will not understand, how much you could truly miss, that first time watching it!"

","This highly suspenseful film is full of ghosts, magic, and murder. It is great entertainment as you the viewer try to figure out whether the film is about magic and illusion or revenge and murder. The story takes place in the last 1800's in Vienna during the reign of the Hapsburgs. In fact, Crown Prince Rudolf is a primary player in the story. Rufus Sewell, who has played every European king in one film or another, does a super job of play Rudolf. But the primary story is about a young village boy who becomes fascinated with magic and a young aristocratic girl. Ed Norton plays the adult magician, Eisenheim, now grown up and returning to seek the girl he has never forgotten. His magical skills have increased exponentially and they are the tool by which he makes his living, and by which he courts his long lost love, and by which the film's mysteries are finally resolved.<br/><br/>The characters are masterfully portrayed by the cast and help carry the viewer along as they experience the situations generated by the fascinating story of an individual who rises to the top of his profession as an illusionist but is in love with that unobtainable women who is the object of all he desires. This movie is powerful and effective and carries the viewer along on a ride that offers fantasy mystery with adventure and romance thrown in as extras. The settings and ambiance leave little to be desired and establish an aura of romantic intrigue that compliments the outstanding acting on the part of the entire cast. The background music and surround sound never overpower the dialogue and the overall balance produces a highly effective movie that leaves the viewer wanting more.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"classicalsteve","9","1","2","22 October 2016"," Enjoyable 19th-Century Mystery-Fantasy About the Power of Illusion
","In the wake of the Enlightenment of the late 17th and 18th centuries, the 19th century saw a rise in interest in the occult, mysticism and magic. Séance ceremonies, fortune-telling, occult literature, and magic acts became widespread in popularity, and much of this interest in matters supernatural and the inexplicable have survived into the 21st century. However, from circa 1845 until the death of Houdini in 1926, magic and illusion were some of the most popular theatrical acts in Europe and America. (Previously performing magicians were often among traveling shows, and today only a handful of magic performers have national and international fame.) ""The Illusionist"", starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel, is a throw-back to the 19th century's obsession with mysticism and magic.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, in a compelling atypical performance, plays Eduard Abramovich, an Austrian provincial, who has made a name for himself as Eisenheim the Illusionist. The film begins in 1889 with the last of a series of controversial theatrical illusions in which apparitions of dead people appear on stage at Eisenbeim's bidding and speak to the audience. Chief Inspector Walter Uhl (Giamatti) stops the performance and arrests the illusionist on the grounds of disturbing the peace. He was sent to arrest both Eisenheim and the performances by Crown Prince Leopold of Austria (Rufus Sewell). Giamatti then meets with Prince Leopold later the same evening and recounts the story of Eduard Abramovich and his rise from lowly peasant to magic superstar who has a following similar to Harry Houdini.<br/><br/>Most of the film is a flash-back from a young Abramovich meeting an elderly magician and then befriending a girl betrothed to the crown prince, Duchess Sophie von Teschen. The two are caught spending time together, and are separated not only because of class but because the duchess is already promised to the crown prince. Fast-forward 15 years, and Abramovich, now known as Eisenheim, is wowing audiences with incredible tricks. The crown prince and duchess, intrigued with rumors about the magician, attend one of his performances, and the duchess is selected to participate in one of the spectacles.<br/><br/>Intrigued, the crown prince invites the magician for a private performance. Then Eisenheim inadvertently humiliates the crown prince in a trick involving the prince's sword, and the love between the duchess and the performer is rekindled. Sensing the magician is not only challenging his political power in the eyes of his subjects but may have designs on his fiancé, the crown prince orders the arrest of Eisenheim. His lust for power and control ends in an unexpected fatality.<br/><br/>This is just a really entertaining movie, somewhat similar to fantasies in the earliest days of Hollywood entertainment. Transitions between scenes sometimes use the old-style kaleidoscopic/tunnel wipes often associated with silent movies. Certainly, Norton's character is the center of attention, but equally good are the supporting characters played by Giamatti, Biel, and Sewell. Giamatti does a fine job of straddling between the inspector of Vienna pledged to uphold the law while doing the bidding of the power-hungry crown prince. Biel is convincing as the duchess not quite enamored with the power of Austrian royalty. I also thought Sewell's performance was superb as the crown prince who seems at first very sure of his existing political power but then finds himself gradually losing its grip. A nice twist at the end makes for a very satisfying cinematic experience. Maybe not quite ""The Prestige"", one of the best films on a similar subject, ""The Illusionist"" still uphold very well on its own."
"sharky_55","4","1","2","16 June 2016"," We've never met before?
","Why are the two leads of The Illusionist, Eisenheim and Sophie, so drawn to each other throughout their lives? We are apparently shown in a long flashback sequence. Anyone would recognise this as a flashback even without the words - the softening bloom of the edges, the saturation of the yellows, the slight vignette effect, the ornate shallow focus. This is all very pretty, but it doesn't shed much light on their relationship, other then the fact that it is the classic rich girl drawn to the street tramp and his tricks. And later in the painfully slow, clichéd and draw out love scene, they silently stare into each other's eyes, and the camera keeps it all nice and PG, presenting only vague spots of skin in the flickering candlelight. Perhaps they are silent because after years apart they still have nothing to say. The film gives no indication of any kind that would justify the pair being the soul-mates they are; their characterisation is lazily empty (as are their atrociously inept accents, a result of the unnecessary decision to set the film in some vague, anachronistic period). <br/><br/>But of course this type of film is not about the characters - it holds the same tension and mystery as a heist, or a detective story. It relies the audience, similar to the one at Eisenheim's magic shows, to not think too hard or pay complete attention...to be distracted by the obvious distractions that the magician holds up, or in this case, the director. There are a few clever moments; one is when Eisenheim greets Sophie after years apart with the conventional magician's test that proves she is not one of his plants, but in the case the words are laced with heartbreak and regret. But of course we are not made to care and hope for these two - the flashback has already established that they will be together by the end of the film (because no script would ever tear a pair apart like that and have them simply never see each other again), so where is the tension? At the end, Uhl pulls together all the pieces in our minds, and this is where usually we have our fingers ready at the pause button, to map all the subtle clues and eagerly flick back through the film to spot them. But this film doesn't even grant us that little joy. It shows us flickers of events we have not previously seen, and congratulates itself on being so clever for revealing something that was inevitable. We see the same problem with the main villain, Leopold. He comes with evil twirling moustache and all and as always, is completely convinced that his actions are necessary and for the greater good. This would actually mean something if we saw anything of this world besides a few peasant audiences, beggar boys and faceless policemen. They haven't even cast the Emperor, so who cares about a baddie trying to overthrow him?"

The explanation given the conclusion is clever accompanied by enchanting visual flair to showcase the magic. Norton is superb as someone gifted with questionable talent yet longing for a love that was taken from him. Jessica Biel plays the fiancé of the crown Prince who remembers Norton from years earlier and still carries the special necklace given to her. Rufus Sewell is disappointing as the tyrant tight ass Prince whom Norton believes committed murder. We can predict a big showdown between the two adversaries and Biel ending up in the right direction. Paul Giamatti steals scenes as the police inspector as he struggles to figure out the magician's secrets and always falling short. Eddie Marsan plays Norton's manager and the role would take an illusion to render it interesting. While at times clever it also falters to formula periodically but it never fails to entertain. It argues the effects of magic yet never denies its explanation but its creativity and sensational style is no illusion. Score: 8 ½ / 10"
"Marc_Israel_365","6","1","2","3 April 2014"," A poor mans' ""The Prestige"" dressed up as an illusion
","There are a few things to like about ""The Illusionist"" but just as many to wonder who the director thought the audience is. I like Norton as the quietly suffering illusionist, but a story about a magician should draw you in because you understand his world. ""The Prestige"" completely gets it while here we get a teenage love story without a mentor pushing our young hero to ""go for it"". We learn the secret to one simple tell tale trick but absolutely nothing about the continuous trick of seemingly bringing back the dead. That was the fascination the drives the plot home, but it is magical and we are forced to take it at that value with no mythology or reason. Insulting! The summary of our watcher putting the pieces back together is nice and tidy but full of holes and happens too fast to realize that he'd have no idea if his assumptions really add up and are plausible. The mystery is romantically predictable and the pay off feels trite"

","The was the first movie I've seen with Jessica Biel and the second for Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, ""The Hulk"" and ""Big Fat Liar,"" respectively. I've always enjoyed period movies, plus this is highlighted by a grand Austrian setting and fine performances. Norton plays magician who as a poor boy who loses his true love played as an adult as Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti is the police inspector trying to understand their precarious secret love under the suspicions of a local prince. There are a few parallels to the ""Moulin Rouge,"" but this movie is accentuated by a top-notch plot incorporating a mystery and suspense into a love story. Placed in the late 19th century, I was expecting maybe a Houdini reference, maybe more historical details to place the movie, but knowing when it happens is not nearly as important. The movie is actually nothing but a love story with mystical and mysterious overtones as unlike Houdini, Norton's character embraces Spiritualism to force a confession from the prince who has murdered his lady love, or so it seems, but as his character reveals, nothing is ever as it seems."
"AbhiMathews","8","1","2","25 June 2013"," A Magical Story
","A magician's trick is his alibi, his lure, his identity. At a young age, all Eisenheim(Edward Norton) wanted to do was disappear with his love, Sophie(Jessica Biel). The two were from different casts but did not care for social differences, yet the aristocrats interfered with their relationship and broke them apart, leaving their love forever unfulfilled...<br/><br/>The Illusionist is a fantastic film that not only displays the genuine love between two destined individuals, but brings viewers on a journey which reveals the depths of it. Although this movie is fictional, it is the plot and imagery that gives The Illusionist its sheer beauty. <br/><br/>Everyone has a love for magic deep within them. Some grow out of it at an early age while others continue their passion. Whether Eisenheim practices magic primarily due to his love for the art or for Sophie is subject to debate, but he certainly demonstrates the true power of his heart.<br/><br/>Viewers can argue about the validity of various details and the discrepancies of the plot with the time frame, but regardless of any inaccuracies, the true meaning of The Illusionist is found in its core - the story. This tale about a man and a woman keeping their spark alive through the most difficult of times is a beautiful one that deviates from the standard mold of contemporary romance, and shows that love is magical."
"Arconada","5","1","2","25 February 2013"," Too far fetched
","The Illusionist is, like The Prestige, a movie about conjurers. These movies were made around the same time and both play around the turn of the 20th century. Where The Prestige succeeds, though, The Illusionist fails. In general, a script describes a series of events that should result in an exciting storyline with possibly an unexpected plot twist, so the moment you think the story is going to unfold itself in a certain direction, it suddenly turns and heads into another direction. That worked in The Prestige, it doesn't work in this movie. The twist was too far fetched. The scene where it all went wrong for me was the moment Inspector Uhl went back to the stable to look for additional evidence. The apparent fact that the scene of the crime was still untouched after all this time overstretched my willingness to believe in this script. Like beads on a broken necklace the remaining scenes of the movie lost all coherency. Also, the fact that the movie in the end needed a visualized thought-process to explain what we should have understood what happened all along, was too silly for words. And last but not least, the idea that ""the bad people lived happily ever after"" is not a good premise for a movie in this category. Still, I gave it 5 out of 10 for the way they visualized the old city of Vienna of those days."

","Neil Burger's ""The Illusionist"" stars Edward Norton as a Eisenheim, a master magician who falls in love with Jessica Biel's Duchess Sophie von Teschen. Their romance irks the Austrian Crown Prince, who wishes to eliminate Eisenberg, but who fears to do so because the young magician is immensely popular with the masses. The Crown Prince thus sets loose his head of security, played by Paul Giamatti, to investigate Eisenheim and develop a method of tactically dispatching the magician. Eisenheim, meanwhile, wages an unconventional war on the Prince.<br/><br/>For most of its running time this is a stylish, unique film. Burger bathes each frame with sepia light, his cinematography rich and moody, resembling a room full of half-lit candles, each frame dim around the edges, like old footage torn from a dying projector. His depiction of 1900 Vienna is similarly cosy, with his cast of suited gentlemen, top-hats, horse-drawn carriages, cobblestones and lovely Viennese, Baroque architecture. Combine with a score by Philip Glass and you have a unique form of Romanticism; Visconti opulence meets a Hollywood sensibility.<br/><br/>There are other nifty things scattered about. We're initially unsure whether Eisenheim's magic tricks are supernatural miracles or simply very good cons, Edward Norton's performance (is he villain or desperate lover?) is riveting and Burger's balcony shots of Eisenheim's performances preserve the integrity of turn-of-the-century spectacle. Eisenheim's illusions – hushed, riveting, almost paranormal – are themselves design to conjure up the work of cinema's great illusionist, George Melies, who around the same period was dazzling minds with his blend of magic and early movie-making.<br/><br/>Mostly, though, the film is interesting for its war between state – the Crown Prince and Emperor Franz Joseph I – and its lowly magician. Eisenheim, who the masses believe to be a genuine sorcerer, essentially begins to have his own cult, a populist army which he uses to defend himself against the Prince, who of course seeks his death. Through his shows, Eisenheim then begins to overtly attack the Prince, accusing him or murder, treason and conspiracy. This subplot recalls everything from early religious blood cults (even Jesus himself, who supposedly, like Eisenheim, was originally a carpenter), which the Romans, Jews and Greeks feared to tamper with lest they instigate populist uprisings, or historical figures and/or groups like Maximilien de Robespierre, the Jacobin Club etc, some of which were responsible for the French Revolution. Eisenheim isn't just a magician, he's, in the eyes of the state, a pervert and subversive.<br/><br/>Unfortunately ""The Illusionist"" begins to collapse as it progresses. The film gets smaller and smaller and all the interesting possibilities it affords are shut down, until it climaxes with a final act revelation in which ""all is explained"". By its end, ""The Illusionist"" is just a Hollywood con movie, with a routine ""flashback/revelation"" climax that was itself in vogue at the time of its release (""Usual Suspects"", ""Signs"", ""Sixth Sense"", ""The Village"", ""The Others"" etc etc). The film missteps further in explaining Eisenheim's magic (a better director would have left the possibility open for the supernatural) whilst paradoxically not explaining it enough (if you're going to rule out the paranormal, then explain these incredulous tricks properly). Meanwhile Jessica Biel's too athletic and muscular for her role and the Crown Prince, played by Rufus Sewell, eventually turns into just another pantomime villain. The film's period details (admirable considering its small budget) themselves get smaller and less enticing as we progress; Burger doesn't explore his sets, his streets, his castles and can't convey any spatial, architectural or environmental ""sense"" outside Eisenheim's theatre halls.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the Crown Prince here is based on the real, hotly debated death of Archduke Rudolf Joseph, which led to Archduke Franz Ferdinand becoming the heir to the throne of Austria. Ferdinand's assassination in 1914 was one of the chief ripples which helped trigger World War I. So Eisenheim's love affair had a bigger legacy: he plunged Europe into war and effectively changed the whole Western World. The film ignores all this.<br/><br/>Many compare ""The Illusionist"" to ""The Prestige"" and complain that the former's ""magic sequences"" are incredulous and/or a cop-out because they utilise CGI. ""The Prestiege"", of course, was about two rival magicians who each found a different means of creating ""the greatest trick ever"". One creates the illusion of teleportation by simply using a twin and enduring some physical pain, the other goes through an elaborate plan which uses science, Tesla coils, clones and replicas which he must then murder. The idea is that the second magician perverts ""magic"". His teleportation is literal, a feat of science. The first magician utilizes a more noble form of misdirection, his planning and penance akin to the medieval craftsman's sacrifices to his art. In ""The Illusionist"" Eisenheim is akin to the first magician, but his magic is treated as being spiritual; he's more witch or sorcerer.<br/><br/>Burger's use of CGI, especially on second viewing, appropriately conveys the feeling that Eisenheim's magic is far beyond the possibilities of 1900s magic. We are deceived, and the effect on us is the same as it would have been on audiences of the time. The problem is not the CGI, but Burger's later, literal revelation that Eisenheim had no powers. Meanwhile Burger has himself said that the film's climax is ""not what really happened"". It's just one character's (and ours?) perception and willingness to believe that Eisenheim escaped and that his lover is alive. ""That's one way to do it,"" Eisenheim says of his magic, but we never see conclusive prove that ""this is how it was"".<br/><br/>Incidentally, Burger's previous movie was a pseudo-documentary which fabricated an interview with JFK's assassin. All the magical tricks in ""The Illusionist"" - no matter how incredulous they seem here - were performed and invented in the 1800s by magicians like Henry Dircks and Jean Robert-Houdin.<br/><br/>8/10 – Similar films: Bergman's ""The Magician"" and Malle's ""Thief of Paris"". Two viewings required."

","I'm a little behind the progress as this was one of the first movies that i saw in blueray format. It looks visually stunning but that's just about all there is to it. It's just superficial with all its computer generated images that i already find quite boring to watch. There's nothing magical about them and i found myself wondering how long is the magician going to show his cgi effect tricks until something's going to happen. It took almost an hour until anything engaging happened.<br/><br/>What comes to the plot it seems very generic and Disney-like that has been told numerous of times before. Then comes the plot twist just before the credits that was supposed to save the dragging movie... it just left me puzzled whether i should hate it or not.<br/><br/>I'm amazed how high this is rated on IMDb. Score of 5 would be more like it.<br/><br/>All in all it's a clean, sterile Hollywood movie, without any deepness to it because the somewhat predictable plot is almost from a storybook which you could read to the children. If i was about 12 years old, i could find this movie appealing."
"toll-8","5","1","2","26 April 2012"," The Illusionist failed to wow me!
","The Illusionist fights a losing battle from the minute you press play. The automatic problem it has is that it is so similar to The Prestige that you instantly compare them. Unfortunately for The Illusionist, The Prestige is such a fantastic film; meaning from the start The Illusionist doesn't live up to expectations. I know you shouldn't really compare films but these two came out within six months of each other, both are period setting, and both about the art of illusion and magic. The Illusionist was released first, so maybe if you saw it first you will like it, however for those who saw it second will only be disappointed. <br/><br/>The Illusionist follows an illusionist called Eisenheim (Norton). As a child he fell in love with a young girl named Sophie. Their friendship was frowned upon due to their substantial class differences, so he found himself running from town to perfect a new found talent; magic. Fifteen years later he returns to Vienna to perform a new magic show. When he asks for a member of the audience as a volunteer, the new fiancée to the Crown Prince (Sewell) steps forward, she turns out to be none other than Sophie (Biel). Instantly their love for each other comes flooding back, and Eisenheim begins to mock her fiancée using his tricks. Knowing that Eisenheim is attempting to win his girls affections, the Crown Prince attempts to find out his secrets and shut him down using Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti). As Sophie begins to choose Eisenheim over the Crown Prince, Eisenheim must devise a plan to leave with his girl, especially since the Crown Prince is known for indulging in murder when he doesn't get what he wants. <br/><br/>I don't want to delve into too much detail of the plot as I don't want to give away whether or not Eisenheim is a master trickster or a man with supernatural power. The whole second half of the film Eisenheim raises spirits, and changes into a man of few words. Is it actually an illusion? This second half is where the film seems to run out of steam though. The film is based on a short story and it is very noticeable that it is as the film does begin to wear thin. The characters aren't very well developed and the plot seems very flat. Also the final twist to the film was very predictable, and came around all too easily. The characters spent the whole film unaware of what was going on and then all of a sudden someone understands it. <br/><br/>The acting was very average. Norton was not his usual self. His delivery of lines seemed to lack tension, but that could have been due to his accent he was putting on. In the second half however, where he mutters minimal words, he is much better as his eyes and facial expressions do the talking. Biel was average and shows that she can do period films as opposed to just teen romantic comedies. Giamatti is in first gear as was Rufus Sewell. I think overall the entire film was a disappointment really, but I think my problem is me comparing it to The Prestige, because I have to say this is nowhere near as good.<br/><br/>Some of the illusions are impressive, especially when Eisenheim removes his gloves, throws them in the air and they turn into crows. These tricks are all impressive but others, where he manipulates reflections in a mirror, have no explanation and it seems a little too unrealistic. This is where I much preferred The Prestige as at least they explained how the tricks worked, here he just raised spirits, and we never know how or why. I suppose maybe a magician never tells his secret.<br/><br/>I was expecting much more than what I ultimately got. I believe that I may have been harsh on this due to my love for Christopher Nolan's period magician piece; however this film could still have been as good if it had managed to make me believe in it. Unfortunately it did not. With a film exploring a plot like this I at least expect a fantastic pull-the-rug-from-underneath-me twist, but I'm afraid the ending seemed an easy way out and was guessed at the half way point. Regrettably The Illusionist failed to wow me.<br/><br/>2.5 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

Maybe people can only be bothered with one Magician movie at a time, the other being the Prestige, which there is no doubt about superior to this one. It still is a very good movie, with a powerhouse performance by (especially) Ed Norton and the other actors involved.<br/><br/>The movie can be watched just as entertainment or you can actually read things into it. Both ways will be rewarding, so you don't have to get everything (intentionally put there or not) to enjoy it. If you do, good for you.

","The movie Illusionist has everything that a good movie needs. Brilliant cast, great plot that sucks you in, breathtaking photography and a good director. The story revolves around a Illusionist known as Eisenheim (allways good Edward Norton). His illusions attract prince Leopold (amazing Rufus Sewell)and his fiancé(Jessica Biel) which happens to be Eisenheim's childhood love. The story also includes chief inspector (wonderfull Paul Giamatti) who is a puppet in hands of prince. The story has enough twists and turns that keeps you wondering what is true and what is only a illusion. The movie is set in Vienna which is hauntingly beautiful fits with the story really well. It gives the movie that felling of authenticity. Ir's a shame that the story isn't more complex and that the characters are so black and white.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>The Illusionist is great example of a good movie that lacks only a little to become a classic. But overall this is a good movie that deserves your attention."

","This movie is a mystery with a romantic twist. That's all it tries to be. Is that a bad thing? No. <br/><br/>There's a plot line that is actually interesting, and it never insults the audience's intelligence. It's beautifully made: the acting, direction, effects, and music are all very good. If you want to watch an interesting movie and the genre appeals to you, I recommend it. If you're expecting the next Titanic, you may be disappointed. The ending of the movie could have been done a little better in my opinion, but it worked and pieced most of the plot ends together. Eisenheim managed to hold my attention throughout the movie, despite the fact that he spends very little time talking. Giamatti's character was very realistic, and provided a good counter to Eisenheim's attitude.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10 Plot: 8 Acting: 9 Direction: 7 (it did drag in a few parts) <br/><br/>Overall: 8"

I was right just on the detail about one man, chief of police, who is reasonable man and who will, in the end put all pieces of mosaic together. Although movie is not filmed in Austria, I never noticed one small detail which will made me suspect it is filmed in Czezch republic. I am also living in ex Austro-hungarian republic, in city which can replace some of the locations, but if it was filmed in my country I wouldn't know the difference.<br/><br/>This movie is one whole completed part, it is a masterpiece that will keep your attention whole time, and which secrets will be revealed at the very end.<br/><br/>Hope this help a little.

Of course, like I expected, it doesn't match at all the suspense or complexity of that incredible piece of work. Nevertheless, it is still a very well-made period piece with strong acting and some good twists and turns down the road. If you can sit through some rough patches in the first forty minutes, you will be satisfied with how it ends. Still, I have to recommend The Prestige. It has better acting, better direction, and the story is so much more deep and meaningful. See this for what it is, but see The Prestige for what it is as well."

","This movie is worth watching, and you have to see every amazing, glamors piece of it. The plot is really well putted, and filled with heart-stopping elements which will masterminds your soul every time you think you've finally discovered the secrets of The Illusionist. Edward Norton is again at its best. He is proving to the audience and the critics that if you are really an amazing actor, all you need to do is show to the public no more then twice in a year. This is a level which Leonardo Di Caprio and Johnny Depp can put. I think the supporting actors were also well chosen, because I haven seen a human being that didn't fit into its role right. Even the servant of the emperor, he was really looking like one, his clothes,every tiny piece of element, was so mathematically well put, that most of the time I was just trying to overcome the fact, that I am watching a movie, which hasn't really made a mistake. Some words should be spoken about the soundtrack also. It was again, well fitted into the whole atmosphere into the movie, and it was also enough effecting, so the audience won't have a slip of breath to use until its genius end. I can really say that this movie is not just worth to be watched, but it should be added to every DVD or at least a fan movie, or at least guy who is using his television, not just as a cupboard.

It snakes around, escaping predicability.<br/><br/>The movie is about ""Eisenheim"" a magician who had a childhood romance with the beautiful Duchess Sophie, and his magnificent illusions.

"The_Void","7","1","2","27 January 2008"," Has holes, but a decent film nonetheless
","Was it just a coincidence that two movies about magicians with a period setting were released within the space of a few months of each other? I don't know, but needless to say this film is always going to find itself being compared with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', and it's always going to find itself in second place because Nolan's film is a hell of a lot better than this one. The two films are similar in that they're both thrillers, both focus on retribution and, obviously, both are based on magicians. This one is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser and focuses on a man named Eisenheim. As a boy, Eisenheim falls in love with a girl a few social classes above himself, but their relationship is broken up for that very reason. Cut to years later and Eisenheim is a successful magician in Vienna. He meets his long lost love during a show and they quickly rekindle their relationship; but being together is a problem as she is engaged to the Crown Prince...<br/><br/>After rising to fame with the likes of American History X and Fight Club in the late 1990's, it has to be said that Edward Norton has been a bit of a disappointment ever since. He really was due a good performance, and while his role here isn't as great as the ones that made him famous in the first place; he performs well and the film definitely represents his best work in years. Norton is given excellent support from the likes of Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel, and the acting is high quality on the whole. As mentioned, the film features a period setting and with the help of some glossy cinematography, it mostly looks very nice. The film is obviously intended to be a thriller, although there isn't a great deal of suspense featured. The plot does remain interesting for most of the duration, however, and there is usually just about enough going on to ensure that it doesn't become boring. The film builds up to a twist at the end. I didn't see it coming myself, though I'm sure many others will. However, in spite of this it is fairly well worked, although the audience is asked to suspend disbelief more than just a little. But even so, this is decent enough entertainment and I did at least enjoy it."
"RNMorton","9","1","2","14 January 2008"," Quite a performance
","And I mean by all four significant leads - Norton (of course), Biel, Sewell and Giamatti. In fact, while channel surfing it was Giamatti's silent realization scene at the bitter end that first drew my attention. Norton plays a stunning magician who appears in 1900's Vienna and becomes focal point for investigation into death and possible murder of evil crown prince's fiancée. Sewell does well in challenging role of prince while Norton is as always fine but perhaps a shade too obscure in lead role. Biel was always a primo looker, she's also an accomplished actress in this one. But I have to say Giamatti as the conflicted investigator steals the show. Musical score and period scenery are great. Docked a point for seeming a little too contrived in how it plays, including the (to me) unnecessary opening sequence."

"rosian","9","1","2","3 January 2008"," Splendid atmospheric movie and clever use of history to very neatly fit in a fictitious Crown Prince
","A very clever story that I won't elaborate on as others have done. We enjoyed it first time. Soon after, we visited Vienna for a few days and after buying the DVD of this movie, I remembered it was mostly set in Vienna.<br/><br/>I'd been interested in the Wittelsbach family for quite a while after visits to Bavaria (the Swan King ""mad King Ludwig II"" etc), and during the Vienna trip I bought a book about the close relatives - the Hapsburgs Kaiser Franz Josef and his wife Sissi. In here was plenty re their children - Sophie, who died very young. The would-be modernist Crown Prince Rudolf who inherited much of his mother's reactionary nature and saw that the stultified Hapsburg court and oldfashioned ways and disregard for the poor of the Hapsburgs and the Court could eventually lead to disaster. After being an agitator for change, and being threatened with arrest for treason if he didn't shut up, and for other reasons concerning his health and love-life to a lesser degree, Rudolf eventually committed suicide. There were two other daughters. Franz Josef's cousin (I think it was) Franz Ferdinand became Crown Prince. It was this Prince who was assassinated at Sarajevo and Franz Josef signed the Articles of War. He died not long after and was succeeded by another cousin who was deposed pretty painlessly towards the end of WW1, just what Rudolf had anticipated would happen if the Emperors didn't change their ways although without any great drama or killing fortunately.<br/><br/>I don't know how the writer of the Illusionist story or the film scriptwriters decided on their characters, but I found it interesting that the movie was set in the period not too long before the 1st World War and the Emperor's picture shown in the movie is clearly Franz Josef late in his life. So Leopold as his fictional second son, the story taking place after Rudolf is dead, this fits in very well with time still for Franz Ferdinand to become Crown Prince after Leopold is dead - another suicide for something like the same reason as his ""real brother"" Rudolf although Rudolf had no wish to depose his father, only to change his ways. Franz Josef was not at all an unkind or cruel Emperor within the bounds of what was customary at the time in Austria, but of course he had to be firm, took his duties and status as Emperor very seriously, and would not have taken kindly to his son threatening sedition etc.<br/><br/>Notable too that the name of the heroine is Sophie, same as the Emperor's first child. And she's mentioned as being of influence in acquiring the Emperorship of Hungary for Leopold if she marries him. In fact it was Franz Josef's wife Sissi (Elisabeth) who had an enormous influence on the Hungarians, becoming very friendly with their leader and having a much loved home in Hungary that she visited often, and very much with her influence the Hungarians agreed to have Kaiser Franz Josef as their King also (much sooner in time than in the movie), hence the Austro-Hungarian Empire - which also included some of Italy, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere at that time. As for Sophie, that was also the name of Franz Josef's Bavarian Wittelsbach mother.<br/><br/>Rewatching, it was great to see all the Viennese scenes including various places we'd been and pick up on the clever use of names and history to fit in Leopold and the Hungarian issues."

","""The Illusionist"" is a movie about an illusionist. The illusionist, Eisenheim (Edward Norton, one of the coolest actors ever) , was born in Vienna and as a young boy met a magician who showed him some cool tricks. He becomes fascinated with magic and decides to follow it as a career path (the movie is unclear whether he studied it at Uni or anything). As he grows up he forms a close relationship with a young girl called Sophie (Jessica Biel, who I've heard of but never seen in another movie, until I looked on IMDb.com and realised she's had bit roles in crappy movies such as ""Elizabethtown"" and ""Cellular"", which my friend Darren loved). Sophie is of noble blood and is strongly told not to hang out with Eisenheim, eventually seeing her taken away from him altogether. Eisenheim eventually runs away and travels the world.<br/><br/>After many years he returns to Vienna to do some shows. His amazing tricks amaze everyone he encounters. One night he calls upon an audience member to volunteer and guess who it is? Sophie! Eisenheim becomes focused on getting back together with her and after an evening where they express their love physically he hatches a plan. It won't be easy though as Sophie is engaged and about to become a royal. Will the plan work? See it to find out.<br/><br/>A great movie that keeps you enthralled and never misses a beat. A solid cast, most notably also starring Paul Giamatti (in his most challenging role since ""Big Fat Liar"") and Rufus Sewell."

","""The Illusionist"" is a mystery from the early 1900 time period. The imagery is dark and adds to the mystique. I have seen ""The Illusionist"" several times and I predict that this movie will become a classic film. <br/><br/>Eisenheim, (Edward Norton), is a turn of the century magician living in Vienna. He is charismatic and his gaze is described as mesmerizing. He is called a charlatan and a tricker. His words are intriguing leaving the audience spellbound, asking for more and demanding answers from his illusions. One night, Crown Prince Leopold, (Rufus Sewell), brings his fiancé Sophie, (Jessica Biel), to the show. Years earlier, Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood friends. It is their secret. She recognizes Eisenheim and contacts the magician later regarding their past. A love scene involving the two reveal their romantic tendency. Sophie then refuses to go away with the Crown Prince and it appears she is murdered. Eisenheim gives up everything and begins a new show leaving the grandeur of the theater behind. Before leaving, a mob outside demanding to know more, leads Eisenheim to confess to his followers. ""It is not real. It is impossible to speak with anyone from the other side."" Inspector Uhl,(Paul Giamatti), leads an investigation and all evidence points to the Crown Prince. I don't know if I like the ending. It reveals a twist in the plot as if it was all staged and I think the ending may be unrealistic."

","If you go into this movie expecting a wonderfully original storyline, you'll be missing the point.<br/><br/>The basic plot is the simple period piece, which is still used because it works, even though we've all seen it before (Yawn). However, combine the period piece with another old favourite, the mystery, and you have the potential for an Oscar, which I honestly believe this movie deserves.<br/><br/>I respected Ed Norton before The Illusionist, now he's one of my favourite actors. He seems comfortable in any role thrown at him (Think Fight Club, then watch this.) Jessica Biel backed up her beauty with some truly accomplished acting, Paul Giamatti gave the chief inspectors internal struggle depth and realism, while Rufus Sewell almost became the ruthless Prince Leopold.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. It made me cry, it made me laugh and it reminded me to tell my wife how much I love her. The effects, even though computer generated and not illusions, were wonderful and somehow still managed to retain some of that old-world feel. The cinematography weaves a wonderful tapestry all around you, while creating a visual masterpiece (of course, Jessica Biel always helps...)<br/><br/>Period films, as a general rule, are not my favourites - maybe because there are many mediocre ones out there - but the mystery and romance embroidered into The Illusionist helped it work its way into my heart, and my small DVD collection.<br/><br/>Forget the nay-sayers, just watch (and love) this movie."
"Philby-3","8","1","2","10 December 2007"," Magic entertainment
","This movie will inevitably be compared with Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"", another story about turn of the century stage magicians which also appeared in 2006. It is however a different kind of movie, quieter, and intense rather than spectacular. The setting is Vienna in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is a successful stage magician who unfortunately incurs the ire of the arrogant and autocratic Crown Prince Leopold (Rupert Sewell). We see the story through the eyes of Inspector Uhl, (Paul Giamatti) who is sent by Leopold to investigate Eisenheim. In fact, both Leopold and Eisenheim are in love with the same woman, Sophie, Duchess of Somewhere (Jessica Biel). So we get a tussle between power and intellect. No prizes for guessing the winner, but there's plenty of surprises on the way.<br/><br/>We are treated to four very fine performances. Edward Norton as Eisenheim gives very little away and yet we sense his feelings. Paul Giamatti is more assertive than in some of his earlier roles  a bit like Claude Raines as the shady policeman in ""Casablanca"". He too, acts with his eyes. Rufus Sewell, who has very large eyes, does villains just as well as heroes, and does a very hiss-able one here, though on occasion I was strangely reminded of Jack Lemmon as the comically stark raving mad Prince Hapnik in ""The Great Race"". I haven't seen Jessica Biel before (a soap princess, it seems), but she has just the right fragile beauty for Sophie.<br/><br/>The re-creation of the period is faultless, with Prague and environs filling in for Vienna. The film-makers were able to use Konopiste castle, the former Czech country home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which has an unforgettable hallway decorated with the heads of thousands of deer. Yes, you think, this is the home of someone who likes shooting things. The character of Leopold is based on that of Crown Prince Rudolf, heir to the throne, who is supposed to have committed suicide with his mistress at Mayerling in 1889, though it has been suggested he was murdered to forestall an attempt to overthrow his father. Franz Ferdinand was Rudolf's cousin (and subsequent heir to the throne) whose assassination in 1914 tipped Europe into the First World War.<br/><br/>But the film is not historical, neither is it a mystery. You can believe in spirits if you like, or you can accept the rational explanation of the illusionist's ""magic"". This is a surprisingly entertaining film. What I find very interesting is that the director, Neil Burger, who also wrote the script, has apparently little prior experience in film-making, yet somehow managed to produce a tight, well-made entertainment. In the audio commentary on the DVD I watched he makes it clear his movie-making instincts are right on the button. The film is a credit to the Czech film crew as well. The producers, though, had the last laugh. This film cost $16.5 million to make and grossed over $32 m in the US alone. ""The Prestige"" grossed $53m in the US but, made in the much more costly US, cost $40m. Good films both, but in their different ways."
"eekmyhero","10","1","2","2 October 2007"," Truly entertaining movie
","I bought this movie based on the high caliber of Edward Norton's previous performances. Expecting a very good performance, this movie exceeded my expectations and became my favorite movie of the year, possibly two years. A love story in a mystery, it leads you down what seems an inevitable path. You'll be amazed at the illusions and enjoy ""The Usual Suspects"" manner twists. Paul Giamatti's performance as chief inspector should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor. Edward Norton gives another great performance, believable as a magician/illusionist possibly reaching into supernatural realms. Only one scene with extremely brief nudity (unfortunately, it reminded me of the impossible-number-of-hands-all-over-the-body scene in the comedy ""Top Secret"") seemed too underdeveloped; however, you'll forgive this minor point."

","It's hard not to compare this movie with The Prestige since it shares a lot of similarities.<br/><br/>Both movies managed to keep the audiences guessing to the end, which in it self is a bit of an achievement, but with very different result.<br/><br/>Where The Prestige settled with the conclusion being tragic and sci-fi, The Illusionist managed keep it fictional and ended with happy ending.<br/><br/>I think it's a lot harder to have a convincing happy ending with fictional believable story than having tragic sci-fi these days.<br/><br/>In terms of cinematography and visual treat The Prestige has the edgy because it had more budget and the director had the ability to utilize it but as a whole I think The Illusionist worked better as a film."

I readily think he could have done the entire movie without speaking a word! The body language, facial expressions, and eye movement spoke volumes. Paul Giamatti was very convincing, almost to a British end, entirely to the finish. Jessica Biel does wonders with her earthy beauty, developing her character from the proper little girl to the well off ""girl next door"" with a repressed ""happiness"" yearning to be free. A love story, mystery, drama, and thriller all in one. Very well put together and the ending was phenomenal! I'm sure seeing it again would have me thinking a lot more about events in the movie.

","This movie was sadly a disappointment. Spoilers ahoy! This movie set itself up as mystery, so much so, that I set out to solve it. Unfortunately I solved the ""surprise"" the moment it purportedly appeared.<br/><br/>Never in a movie has the solution been so signposted, signalled, foreshadowed, and hinted at. I could have forgiven this obvious defect had it comprised some wit. Yet it was a weak twist. Worse, the happy ending of the movie depended on incurring the death of a villain who was more of an intellectual than a loathsome evil-doer. We are told he beats up women, yet we are never shown him as anything except a rather interesting chap with a bit of a temper. The villains demise was nothing short of a cold and calculating murder of an innocent man by proxy by the ""hero"" in effect. And the hero himself was devoid of much character. He gives some coins to some kids, so that we cheer him on as a fine fellow in a mindless ploy to get us to like him.<br/><br/>Through the movie, I consistently liked the villain, and grew to despise the magician. Such a waste! And the impossible tricks he performed were unexplained. Projection was patently impossible. Those images were holograms, how did he do that, I am still baffled! How did that sword trick operate? If it were supernatural, then the plot fails, for he could just magic his way out of trouble.<br/><br/>The Prestige, an infinitely better written and executed movie, SPOILER ahead - did cheat, but this cheating was carefully sandboxed and was used to great effect, they pulled it off. But here the cheating is not acknowledged nor explained.<br/><br/>Shame, I really was expecting to like this movie."

","The Illusionist is also a bit sluggish, sort of like a complicated magic trick building to its climatic conclusion. It starts at the turn of the century, when mysterious stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton) arrives in Vienna and begins performing his astounding illusions. He arouses not only the curiosity of the people, who believe he has otherworldly powers, but of the ruthless Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), an unsavory fellow who'd like to prove the man a fraud, especially after he witnesses a budding attraction between his beautiful fiancé, Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), and the magician. What Leopold doesn't know is that Eisenheim and Sophie were once childhood sweetheartsand now that they've reunited, a dormant and forbidden love affair has been rekindled. Now it's up to Vienna's shrewd Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to uncover the truth, charged by Leopold to intensify his efforts to expose Eisenheim. With Uhl doggedly pursuing the man behind the magician, Eisenheim prepares to execute his greatest illusion yet."

","Rarely do I give movies a 10. They have to be perfect. This movies was. Brilliantly conceived, well acted, wonderful love story and a bit of a mind twister, even if I did have it worked out about 1/2 through. That's OK when all the parts come together as they did in this work. There just isn't a weak spot. The Prince is princely and evil... we don't have to stretch our imaginations too far for that. The police are corrupt, until finally confronted with what they believe to be incontrovertible evidence. The heroine is beautiful, poised and determined to spend her life with the man she loves, even if it means self destruction. And our hero is a hero of epic proportions. Philip Glass's music, ever so improved from the '80s, is flawless also, if not a little distracting a few times. But like Hermann, he understands how to create tension when necessary and beauty with harmony when that fits the picture. The cinematography is truly remarkable, lending an air of a 19th century daguerreotype photography... with a faded patina, yet crisp, somehow. And the illusions...did I forget the illusions? Of course, we can, today, do so much with holograms. But this is the 19th century and the movie is good enough to make us believe that we are actually watching something in the 19th century. Thus, we are astounded. Watch the orange tree grow. It may not be the most spectacular of the illusions, but it is the most harmoniously perfect. Of course, anyone who loves Bergman will be reminded of ""Ansiktet"", the Magician. The plot is different, but the reaction of the establishment is not...in fact almost identical. That also, was a great movie and I'm sure that Neil Burger was inspired by it. Bravo, is all I can say. If I had been in a theatre at the end I would have stood and applauded."
"lee_eisenberg","7","1","2","10 February 2007"," he lived in turn-of-the-century Vienna but never met Sigmund Freud
","In ""The Illusionist"", Edward Norton plays a magician who uses his tricks to upset the power structure. Whenever he performs his tricks, he reminds us how one can never be totally certain about what's real and what isn't. I guess that the correlation is that Austria-Hungary has a status quo - in that it's run by straight-laced aristocrats - and this magician is changing it; showing that the status quo doesn't have to be, if you will.<br/><br/>But even without that aspect, it's still a pretty fascinating movie. Even though Eisenheim is a fictional character, one has to wonder what it must be like to be in his audience and witness his tricks. If anything lessens the movie at all, it's that the woman-loves-someone-outside-her-social-circle premise seems pretty routine (and why do the characters in these movies always have English accents?). But overall, I really liked it and I recommend it. Also starring Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell.<br/><br/>I wonder why they didn't incorporate Sigmund Freud into the plot. I bet that he could have had some comments about illusions."

Jessica Beil has never been one of my favorite actresses, but in this movie, she was fantastic. The love scene between Norton and Beil was beautiful, and one of the sweetest scenes I have seen in a movie lately. I thought that this movie was breathtaking; when Norton performed his illusions, I was on the edge of my seat (or, well... my bed, as I rented the movie and watched it from the comfort of my own home lol) and by the end, when Inspector Uhl figured everything out, I was SPEECHLESS! The ending was completely unexpected, I have rarely been happier with an ending. Not that I was happy with this one: I didn't want it to end! I LOVE LOVE LOVED this movie.

","I recently watched this remarkable movie on DVD and all I can say is that I want to apologize to everyone involved who was responsible for the making of this movie. To the director, actors, writers and producers... I'm sorry for not having paid to see this at the cinema and for not supporting it sooner. I now own a copy on DVD and I'm recommending it to everyone I know.<br/><br/>The Illusionist is a heady and heartfelt instant classic in my book. It dabbles with mysticism but never loses sight of character. It tells a wonderful story and keeps you guessing throughout. Marking its true greatness is the fact that the director utilizes every bit of the phenomenal acting talent that he assembled. Norton hits a home run, Giamanti is perfect and Biel displays acting chops to go along with her stellar beauty. The Illusionist is what the cinema is for, too bad I missed the opportunity to view it on the big screen."

The sepia colour to the film made it nostalgic and captivating. I enjoyed the soft focus scenes and the flash backs. Paul Giamatti was perfect as Inspector Uhl. I grew to dislike the Crown Prince immediately at his low underhanded tactics due to his incompetence and jealousy of Eisenheim. It was a great film, its top of my list to buy as soon as possible.

"agiacumakis","5","1","2","6 February 2007"," Predictable, predictable
","Goodlooking film, nice atmosphere and decent acting. But here's the point: The movie gives the plot twist away half way through...which makes viewing the unraveling of events that follow disappointing and completely obvious. At first, I thought this may have been an intentional misdirect by the director to further disguise the movie's big reveal. But alas, that's not the case and the plot ends up right where you figured it would. <br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW:<br/><br/>You'd have to be a moron to not figure this one out: A love sick princess looks at her forbidden lover (an Illusionist no less) and says ""we've got to figure out a way to be together but no one can know about it"". Then The Illusionist squints his eyes in deep thought and the scene ends. I wonder what's going to happen now? Could there be a double meaning to the movie's title? Could the whole story actually be an illusion too? <br/><br/>The answer of course is yes. The plot is an illusion as well and the big reveal at the end of the movie means I wasn't supposed to be able to figure it out. How condescending can the film makers be? Why even have that scene in the middle of the film where the two lovers have that conversation? That ruined an otherwise enjoyable film."
"Robert_duder","7","1","2","4 February 2007"," Rather light little tale about a magician and his love...nothing shocking or surprising
","The Illusionist is good but that's just it...that's where it ends. The film has plenty of strong actors, a decent story, potential for a great period piece but instead the entire film beginning to end is just okay. The acting is 'just okay', the direction is 'just okay', the story...'just okay' and the twist at the end is easy to see coming which is unfortunate because it holds a lot of stock in it but I figured it out and I rarely figure anything out in a film with a twist. Despite taking place in Vienna at the turn of the century there is nothing historic about the film and despite moments of action, mystery and intrigue there just isn't anything to shout about...it's an all around average film...not bad...just not impressive.<br/><br/>Edward Norton is the lead as mysterious magician Eisenheim who, as a boy, fell for a girl far from his social standing and then lost touch with her seemingly forever. He traveled the world and became a renowned magician. It has been a long time since Norton took the helm in a lead role and there is no doubt that Norton is a great actor, he blew me away in Primal Fear, and American History X, both Academy Award nominated roles. However Norton's return to lead is less than impressive. He does captivate and he's easy to watch but his role is so bland and although he does his utmost to capture the mystery and romance it never quite flies the way it could or should have. Jessica Biel is his lady friend who he reunites with many years later and begins an illicit affair. I don't know if Biel is a good actor yet, I haven't decided. I know that I've seen her in some real stinkers including Stealth. Her English accent is bad and overdone, but her chemistry with Norton is good and they play well off each other so they do alright in the roles. One of my newest favorite actors Paul Giamatti plays Inspector Uhl who is investigating a murder and all paths one way or another keep leading him to the Magician. Giamatti's role is unfortunately small and does not allow him to do anything fantastic which is kind of the ongoing feat behind this film. Finally the nemesis is played by the appropriately evil looking Rufus Sewell as the Crown Prince who appears to be the most realistic suspect in the murder but no one dares go after. He's overbearing and angry and a great nemesis to Norton but as with everyone else's part he is held back by the script and story.<br/><br/>With more epic proportions, The Illusionist could have really been something. And it's not that it's not worth seeing...in fact it's a cute little film and actually a very nice twisting sort of romance but it's just not as spectacular as it could have been and that is disappointing. New film maker Neil Burger has a habit of overlooking details that could make a film great. His very first Indie film ""Interview With The Assassin"" could have really been incredible but instead was average at best and The Illusionist falls to the same fate. So worth watching but won't blow you away....get something else with it to satisfy you. Average in every way. 7/10"

","Lush cinematography and some great visuals, with an interesting but underdeveloped story. The performances are okay, with Giamatti being the clear standout, between Sewell's one-note villain, Norton's lifeless character, and Biel's reduced screen time. The story is pretty good, but can't decide between romance or mystery or both, and the magic scenes - while well done - don't add a whole lot to the story. The ending feels contrived, also, as I'm unsure why the filmmakers felt the need to explain the 'illusion' that was pulled off, when none of the actual magic tricks were explained. Still, this is a very well-made, old-fashioned movie, with great atmosphere and visuals."

I was taken in by the pure magic of the film, and remained totally engrossed throughout the whole viewing. I haven't enjoyed a movie that much in years. Today it is hard to find a movie that can bring out a little of the innocence and faith of a child in us. Edward Norton's greatest illusion was making me forget the actor, and focus on the character of Eisenheim, who for a moment in time had me spellbound. I have not really seen Jessica Bel in any movies that I remember, but she was beautiful in a soft and genuine way, which transcends outer beauty, and without thinking about it you understood why Eisenheim never forgot Princess Sophie. Only a combination of equally great writing, directing, and acting skills could have you feel the love of these two people, with such a limited coverage of their distant past. I have always enjoyed Paul Giamatti's performances, and his portrayal of Chief Inspector Uhl called for a transition in the character ,and the best part comes toward the end of the film...perfect execution. The casting of Norton, Biel, and Giamatti in their respective roles was sheer genius;add the writing, directing, and acting skills and the result proved to be the real predictability in this film.

In addition, Philip Glass' score was excellent, a perfect supplement to the beautifully muted cinematography. Watch for the carriage ride with the Crown Prince in disguise where his Chief Inspector played by Paul Giametti reminds one of Orson Welles. I wasn't impressed with Mr. Giametti in ""Sideways"" but this film establishes his credentials. Rufus Sewall and Jessica Biel should also not go unmentioned-both are outstanding. Another thing that impresses about the film is the attention given to the lesser characters...The Manager, the mysterious Magician, the Doctor, the police aides.

You sit through the first hour just waiting for something to happen. It's one of those ""this is boring but I can't turn it off 'cause it feels like something's going to happen any minute now"". Then you waste an hour and a half waiting for something to happen that never does.<br/><br/>Also, the movie does not form a tight enough connection between its characters and the audience, so any dramatic turn of events lacks the shock value.<br/><br/>This movie is slow, very much NOT in the suspense genre, and just ""blah"".

Passed over for the Oscar in many fantastic performances, Giamatti should finally receive the coveted gold statue for this characters role and his creativity to bring about not only his detective role into the realm of reality but also for truly bringing this movie to life. Many period piece movies often are left leaving the viewer only imagining what that period of time must have been like. Giamatti and Edward Norton's role in this film lend the viewer the opportunity to actually put yourself into the story and the year. Of his various characters Edward Norton during has played during his career, this one is by far his absolute best and most believable. He adds mystery and a sense of class to his character and gives an unimaginable performance that should by rights, land him an Oscar in this performance as well. Not to be forgotten, is Jessica Biel's role as the duchess and love interest of Norton's character as well as the soon to be king. In this film she steps away from the cutesy girl role that has, in my opinion, molded her into a medium grade actress at best. She and her character shine very notably in this role. In this place and time setting she travereses far beyond her previous roles and presents herself as a lady of character, substance and real depth in her acting. To give this film less than a 10 would be a crime when compared to such horrible actors such as Will Ferrel who receive accolades for shoddy dim-witted performances these days. This is a truly fresh and brilliant movie that compliments itself in it's ending."

","I saw this movie on DVD about 5 months after it first came out in theaters. I don't understand why it hasn't received more acclaim.<br/><br/>The plot kept me going all the way thru and the ending got me much in the same way that the ending of Usual Suspects did when it turned out that Verbal Kint was really Kaiser Soze. I never considered the possibility of that ending in either movie and it worked brilliantly both times.<br/><br/>I almost expected Inspector Uhl to catch up with Eisenheim on the train and say words to the effect that ""This is going to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" but wasn't to be, perhaps for the better.<br/><br/>I don't know enough about magic or magicians, but I wonder if there was ever a real magician who could even come close to doing some of the tricks that Eisenheim did? Even though you know it's the movie's special effects doing those tricks, for the most part, you still believe it a magician is doing them. Having said that, though, I think if a magician could perform those tricks today on a stage, he'd make a pretty good living."

","My cousin has been raving non-stop about this film since last summer when it opened. I didn't see it in theaters (though I regretted not after hearing his praise) so I was eager to rent it when it arrived on DVD. It did sooner than expected and I rented it a week after it made it's premiere on the shelves. First off, let me start by saying my cousin isn't going to be very fond of my review. But I will continue. The movie is shown in flashbacks and opens with Eisenheim the Illusionist, a traveling magician, being arrested. We see the movie as it goes through different time periods, from when Eisenheim was a young boy to him grown up as a traveling magician. He is instantly famed for doing tricks absolutely no one can figure out. But, as Eisenheim says so himself, everything is an illusion. One very good thing about this film was the cinematography. The colors used and camera angles were all very, very, very well done especially the mysteriously filmed sex scene. The storyline was interesting enough, and the acting was very good, but what I found about this film was that is was tedious. I had to fight myself to keep awake during a few select scenes (maybe it was because I started it at 10:30 at night but I'm not sure) and that a lot of it was redundant. I can definitely see why others really like this film but it didn't strike me as something that I would watch over and over again. It's a good film, but it's far from great."
"persianguy1470","8","1","2","17 January 2007"," A Masterpiece!
","This by far is one of the best films i have ever seen. I have never heard of this film during its theatrical release and heard about it when it was just release and my sister rented it. I didn't expect much from it, i thought it would be just a Friday night movie. Oh, how i was wrong. This movie was incredible. It has everything - suspense, romance, thrilling twists, mystery, all into one film. It does have an unoriginal beginning, girl and boy love each other and they cant see each other. It has a Romeo and Juliet element in it that is common, but what i love about it is how they made that common element into a thrilling, suspenseful mystery with twists that keep teasing you and keeps you guessing. It has the amazing actor Edward Norton (Fight Club) who plays Eisenheim The Illusionist and does a stunning performance. Also, there is the beautiful Jessica Beil who play the Duchess Von Techen. Paul Giamatti plays the Inspector of the film and plays an outstanding act. Beautiful job by all the actors, you couldn't ask for any better actors. All characters are preformed beautiful. They all had the vivid and accurate accents that just blended into the movie and you wouldn't believe that they were American. The setting is also extremely perfect for this film. The Directer, Neil Burger, picked to the city of Prague to show the old city of Vienna in 1900, and it was beautiful. The castles, the clothing, and the streets were shown accurately and was very well done. Not only that, but the film has BEAUTIFUL music by Phillip Glass and it plays the exact mood of the film. The Music itself has a mystical element and fits beautifully in the film. Some people believe that it is predictable, but i was on my toes, waiting to see what would happen and the ending just blew me away. Some people believe that everything was predictable, i just have one message. You go make a film that is better than this, then i will agree with you. Making a mystery, suspense, romance, and a thriller in one film is pretty hard, and the makers did it beautifully, I highly recommend this film. It is one of my top 3 most favorite films ever in my life and will be for a while. I have seen this movie at least 8 times since its release on DVD, watched it with my family and friends and they all loved it. A True Masterpiece."

","What a movie... I didn't expect a movie to be this good, after everyone had threw this out, seeing The Prestige. But for me,(although I haven't seen Prestige)I have been blown away. A movie based on the late nineteenth century, early twentieth century. During the days of the monarchy of Austria. <br/><br/>I will not go into the story, being a simple romantic story, but the magic tricks shown, plus the screenplay... WOW !!! I mean just WOW !!! Absolutely amazing. Edward Norton fit like a glove in his role as Eisenheim the illusionist. Although I was skeptical, because this is a kind of unlike of him. But he was brilliant. Paul Giamatti, is also wonderful in his role as the narrator/Police Chief Uhl. <br/><br/>But nothing tops the magic. The magic trick, the illusion is unbelievable. Full credits to the director and the screenplay writer. They took their time, pulled together a great cast. And gave a superb result. Dunno why people are screaming about The Prestige, but I'm gonna put my vote in for the Illusionist.<br/><br/>8/10 !!!"

","This movie will hold you from the start to the end; it will ""wow"" you all the time, for its great filming style, its well written story and the best of all: The amazing acting.<br/><br/>The Actor Edward Norton is on what I believe to be his best work so far, but no, he is not the only one; Paul Giamatti, the actor from ""Lady in the Water"", does a superb acting job as well, nailing the part perfectly, but only to be overcome by Rufus Sewell who plays the ""evil"" character.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a must see for any one who enjoy a good conspiracy/detective/magical story, filled with surprises and plots, in addition to three awesome performances from the actors I honored above. Not to put aside the presence of the actress Jessica Biel."

","Besides my amazement at Edward Norton's range, and the magnificence of the whole movie, I was mesmerized at the location because I was in Prague attending a conference at the castle of Liblice in the early seventies, and visited another castle with the hall full of mounted antlers of the hunt trophies where so many of the scenes were filmed. Of all the Edward Norton movies I have watched I think this is by far his masterpiece of acting. If you have ever been in Prague you will have no difficulty understanding the customs of the time, the theme of the story. Paul Giamatti also was superb, quite another amazing range after roles he has played like Sideways The score was excellent and the performance of the Czech Philharmonic was superb."
"AirBourne_Bds","10","1","2","8 January 2007"," Ed Norton makes your breath disappear!
","The photography and even the cinematography of this fine thrilling epic reminded me of the ""Age Of Innocence,"" and I see Dick Pope is familiar with Turn of The Century plots as he also did the film version of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" back in '02! I see this magickal mirage as a potential Oscar contender even if for Costume and Cinematography but also Paul Giamatti should be given the nod in Best Supporting Actor as the tortured Chief Inspector Uhl - does he do the right thing and become totally corrupt or does he allay his soul and forever seal his humble beginnings? His other ignored work was with Arnold McCullers in Duets, but when he was acknowledged for Sideways? Somebody definitely passed the bong around too many times! Ed Norton was despicable as the villain of The Italian Job, he has fought Robin Williams in ""Death To Smoochy,"" and has worked with Spike Lee in a role nobody expected him to take on but now he reaches up his sleeve and pulls a new trick in his role cards! His character's deft weaving of an ethereal tapestry against the poor typecast Rufus Sewell again as another villain, this time as Austrian Crown Prince Leopold (he also sneered in - Knight's Tale; Bless The Child & The Legend Of Zorro - if Rufus played a hero, his performances have obliterated it from most folks' heads)! Jessica Biel as the duchess who dared to love ""beneath"" herself, is a far cry from the action gal with the laser-bow in ""Blade: Trinity""...<br/><br/>The plot itself was a view on many things - the timelessness of true love; how love sees no class/color/religion; what really is truth? How life and death can be intertwined and made to exchange places if only for a pulse...<br/><br/>Also? The importance of planning and how you never think you can outsmart a magician, it was rather like the British TV series ""Hustle"" in terms of the deftness of sewing up the threads of the fine plot and movie - time to disappear! http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com"
"Guinevere723","8","1","2","7 January 2007"," ""Perhaps there is truth in this illusion.""
","A highlight of 2006 that stands out above the rest, Neil Burger's ""The Illusionist"" is a superbly crafted period piece that manages to succeed in being both an endearing historical drama as well as an absorbing and suspenseful mystery/thriller.<br/><br/>For starters, I was especially intrigued by the filmmakers' somewhat ""avant-garde"" approach in making this film in the sense that they always seemed to be conscious of conveying the film as a truly dated period piece혰and by that I mean their use of certain film-making methods (i.e. the use of irises as a transitional device; a technique that is rarely if ever used in contemporary cinema and was usually common in the era of silent films). Such methods succeeded in giving the film an overall aura of antiquity. I really liked that the filmmakers' tried something different, and it immediately grabbed my attention as a sincere film enthusiast.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, the film was strikingly picturesque. Cinematographer Dick Pope certainly deserves kudos for bringing such a vibrant and plush quality to an expectedly dreary and lackluster turn-of-the-century Vienna. Every frame was appropriately toned to fit the sentiment of the scene, which only helped to heighten the film's overall effect. And though its not his most noteworthy comprehensive work, I was especially fond of Philip Glass' accompanying score. His trademark minimalist, tonal style was a welcome delight and successfully aided in communicating a sense of enchantment and fantasy that aptly matched the film's narrative.<br/><br/>The film's casting was brilliant across the board: both Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are exceptional and personal favorites of mine and, in my opinion, are two of the utmost talented (and at times underrated) actors working today. They always prove themselves to be incredibly diverse in their career choices and are both blessed with the capacity of undergoing transformation in order to mold themselves into a particular role, making the characters they play that much more believable. I thought they sparred exceptionally well together and I always relished the moments they shared on screen. As always, Norton is nothing short of spellbinding; I was practically hanging on his every word, gesture and subtlety. I'm so glad he finally decided to take the plunge and partake in a period piece for the first time in his career that has spanned over 10 years. For a supporting role, Giamatti seemed to stand out just as much as Norton, if not more. I almost feel as though Chief Inspector Uhl was the main character in the story and not Eisenheim혰I'm not entirely sure if that should be accredited to Giamatti's acting or to the format in which the story unfolded, but perhaps it's a little bit of both. And I must admit I was especially impressed by the usually pedestrian Jessica Biel. Never in a million years did I think she'd be capable of being convincing in a role like this, but she somehow managed to exude poise and grace on an almost effortless scale. Rufus Sewell was also memorable as the brooding and maniacal Prince Leopold혰he is always able to startle me whenever he goes on his burly tirades: the moment, for instance, when he strikes Sophie across the face with a slap she didn't anticipate, and her cheek slowly flushes into a painful looking crimson was especially disturbing.<br/><br/>If you're wondering if this movie is a life-changing experience or whether it will be the recipient of prestigious nominations/accolades come awards season, I'd decidedly say probably not. The central plot and the overall outcome were not especially unique or innovative by any means; you might in fact call them ""predictable"". I contest, however, that that did not lessen the enjoyment I had while watching the film. You have to remind yourself that despite the triteness of some age-old stories that have been done time and time again, there are other elements added into the mix that can turn a ""been there, done that"" story into something refreshing and relevant. You will find that with ""The Illusionist"".<br/><br/>I reiterate that this is without a doubt one of the better and more impressive films to have come out of 2006. For grossing almost $40 million at the box office alone, that is an impressive feat for a film of this variety and is one of many indications that ""The Illusionist"" vouches to enlighten and entertain those who have the pleasure of viewing it. From an avid film watcher who has tendencies of dishing out harsh criticism, this comes highly recommended혰so don't pass it up!"
"gratineke","9","1","2","3 January 2007"," Loved it!
","I saw this movie during a 12 hour plane ride. And I absolutely loved, loved, loved this movie. Before this movie, I saw some others and they were not very good, average. So, when the Illusionist began, I was a bit bored, tired, thirsty, you know, that feeling if you have a long, long flight. Then I started this movie.<br/><br/>Immediately I was in another, mystic world, and I really, really loved it from minute 1. Beautiful cinematography, perfect styling (very elegant), all the actors perform wonderful and the 'tone' of the movie is just 100% my style. The film moves just fast enough and constantly there is happening something. Not too much, not too less.<br/><br/>At the end however, I had an aha- experience (a 'the usual suspects' one), but that was alright. I am still thinking about this movie and I am still puzzling what actually happened.<br/><br/>Great animations, I was amazed!"
"dean2900","9","1","2","30 December 2006"," Wow! This is a great movie!
","I have to say that I am shocked how good this movie was. I was more interested in seeing The Prestige which I have not seen to this point. I will withhold judgment on the Prestige but I do not see how it could be much better.<br/><br/>I do not want to ruin this movie for anyone. There are many twists and turns and the ending may surprise some and not others.<br/><br/>The movie hits hard on heavy anti government (anti-monarchy), social classes, and many perennial ideas of love, faith, truth, and even science vs religion to a degree.<br/><br/>I always did like magic growing up so I was interested in the movie dealing with such subject matter. If one can argue that Rocky isn't about boxing then you can certainly argue this movie isn't about magic or illusions.<br/><br/>The one flaw the movie had was their really didn't seem to be any chemistry involved in the love story but I honestly could not flaw the movie for this because the love story was used as a means to an end.<br/><br/>The Illusionist keeps you interested from the opening scene to the great finale and has a couple of magnificence performances as well as a genuine feel for the time-period in Vienna.<br/><br/>This is certainly in the top 3 movies of 2006."
"remay1","9","1","2","24 December 2006"," Movie Magic Redux
","The reason you go to movies is to be entertained, period, end of story. After seeing this movie you'll realize that reason is undoubtedly your true motivation more than ever. In this day and age, when every movie seems to be bent on clubbing you over the head with some overt political message, or to nag and goad you into going along with some heavy-handed social arm twisting, what a pleasure it is to discover a movie that returns to the roots of what movie making is, or at least what it truly should be: Escape, imagination, mental challenge, enjoyment, fun... you get the idea. If that is what you look for in a movie, search no further. This movie will whisk you away for two hours of pure fun and escape from your everyday worries and cares. Go, have fun, enjoy. It's worth it. <br/><br/>This year we have been treated to no fewer that two turn-of-the-century movies about magic. this one and The Prestige. While they are both good, this movie wins in the ""entertainment"" category merely due to its much more likable characters and plot. We can identify the good guys and villains and feel good about the first, while loathing the second. In The Prestige, there aren't any heroes.<br/><br/>The movie also possesses one of the best surprise endings seen recently. The magician in the movie keeps you so mesmerized, you don't even notice his true sleight of hand until it is revealed to you at the end. It is truly ingenious, remarkable, satisfying. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie doesn't seem to be getting as much press as some others. Perhaps it is a result of the lack of politically correct content, or, more likely, because it was made by independent film makers, but it deserves much more notice, and audience. If you see it, you see why."

Settings, scenery and cinematography are all excellent. Norton's performance is worthy of an Oscar, as is the film itself. Once in a while, a romance appears without much fanfare and captures the imagination of the viewers. ""Marty"" did it in a different era. This movie certainly left an indelible impression on me. There are no weak performances, though Norton himself stand out and carries the film. The illusions created throughout the story add greatly to the entertainment value.

It's a solid entertainer.Two hours worth your time in the dark.You'll be hypnotized,mesmerized and fascinated by the Illusionist himself,as you continue to decide whether it's supernatural powers or it is real.The film leads to many suspenseful moments and intense drama until it reveals everything right before the end credits,and you are satisfied.Because it doesn't cheat you.<br/><br/>Eisenheim the Illusionist started practicing magic when he was young,and in that very young age he falls in love with a young girl Sophie.As they are forbidden to see each other they still somehow find ways to meet up until they are separated forever.Returning 15 years later as a renowned magician performing in public,Eisenheim faces challenge and rivalry from Chief Inspector Uhl who is loyal to the Crown Prince Leopald.But as Eisenheim learns that Sophie is marrying Crown prince,Eisenheim starts to confront the crown price.And Sophie has already fallen in love with Eisenheim.As they both try to get together,the Inspector and Leopald must separate,or else they shall receive dire consequences.The film shifts to into a murder mystery,and the mystery leads to a satisfying conclusion that will have you smiling that it never cheated you throughout and that it was all in front of your eyes but you believed what you saw.<br/><br/>The Illusionist may have a simple story about forbidden love and all but its execution makes it a more intriguing work.There is mystery,romance,politics,intrigue,drama,thrills,suspense,twists and turn all in one film.While suffering in many areas,the Illusionist still comes out as a winner with its splendid performances given by the actors and its deft direction.<br/><br/>The film boosts a gripping and absorbing feel and atmosphere.The productions designing is well done and evokes the 1900s.The cinematography is rich and a brilliant score aids along.Slick editing aiding its magic tricks.And visuals that deceive your eyes.And a few tricks of magic really have you at awe.The film's magical tone will have you glued to your seat.Its magic tricks are really well executed and it really feels like you are watching a magic show with your host hypnotizing you ,making you believe what he wants you to believe.Its deceiving moves are really what makes the film an illusion.<br/><br/>Director Burger has written a good script.One that relies on character development and one that has a brilliant plot.The story is simple but its development is terrific.He keeps his film from falling as there were many areas where it could've collapsed and you could've walked away from the film.As the film takes the mystery turn,it kind of drags a bit and becomes clueless.We don't understand what is going on.But as everything comes to focus and we slowly start seeing the big picture,we get our moneys worth.The director has a great vision and he is the ultimate illusionist.<br/><br/>The film lacks strong emotional impact.You don't feel much for Eisenheim or Sophie,but you do care to see them together.Halfway through,the whole thing kind of got slightly predictable and obvious.I somehow realized the twist early on,lucky guess.And the film's pace is uneven and it looks old-fashioned at times.And some of the magic tricks are left unexplained.<br/><br/>Edward Nortan is a versatile actor,and the films he has done in the past few years are amazing.He is terrific both as good and evil.And he is terrific in any role you give him.Here,he is at his absorbing best.You are hooked into the man that you don't know what his motives or plans are.He tries to make his character as mysterious as possible,and Norton looks dashing as an Illusionist,and he is very convincing with his accent even when he slips in that.Rufus Swell is an underrated actor,and though he has a larger role,he is given less credit than Jessica Biel.His character's jealousy is well portrayed.He makes his character's anger feel real and you wonder what he might do next to our lovers.Jessica Biel is a real surprise here.Not only does she handles her accent with decency,but she can act.Her small presence was felt as a beautiful and charming Dutches.Though,there is little romantic chemistry between her and Norton,and her character isn't well written,she still manages to leave her mark.The real star of the film ,however,is the multi-talented Paul Giamatti.His portrayal of an officer who is bound to obey the Crown Prince is excellent.His intense confrontation with Eisenheim is superbly executed.He brilliantly captures the confusion and guilt of the character.He has no clue how to arrest Eisenheim with no evidence and yet he wants to help Eisenheim.Like the audience he begins to question his power of perception.Like the audience he is unsure whether Eisenheim really have supernatural powers.And we as an audience are as surprised as he is when the big reveal is shown.His accent is well done and he plays the character with juice.<br/><br/>A mesmerizing work.The Illusionist is one of those Hollywood films that makes Hollywood the best in the world.It has those Hollywood ingredients and feels like a big budget film,at its core its more independent and original.It's pretty much like an illusion.It's a perfect entertainer and you will likely be captured by the Illusionist himself.Good writing,brilliant directing.Strong acting and rich look makes this the years most worthwhile film.And if you ask me,I would say this is slightly better than The Prestige another film about magicians of that same era.As that film relies on tricking the audience than developing a good story.In a way,the Prestige is more complicated for no reason and has powerful twists and turns that you never see coming.Whereas,The Illusionist may seem simple,it pulls a trick or two to be able to compete with The Prestige.But on the whole,The Prestige somehow cheats the audience by playing with them,while this film grabs the audience's attention throughout and giving them satisfaction.I really liked this really good film that was really close to being great.Highly recommended."

","The Illusionist *** http://www.theillusionist.com/ Director Neil Burger Written by Neil Burger from a short story by Steven Millhauser Cast: Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel, Rufus Sewell <br/><br/>Review by Larry Stanley www.penguincomics.net<br/><br/>I had no real idea what I was expecting when I went into the auditorium to see Illusionist. I thought it might be a supernatural film or some piece of drek dealing with evil demons and human sacrifice. Or, for all I knew it could have been a comedy alone the lines of Jerry Lewis' finest work. What I didn't expect was one of the best mystery's this so far this year. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, a young magician in Vienna around the turn of the century who captures the minds and hearts of both the regular citizen and the upper classes when his illusions and abilities mystify them. He has traveled the world, learning the secrets of magic and legerdemain, and now has returned to his home city to live and work. But, Eisenheim is also a man who lost his first and true love as a child because she was a Countess and he was a commoner. And guess who he meets fifteen years later on the opening night of his act? The Countess Sophie, now a stunningly beautiful woman (played with amazing ability by Jessica Biel, who finally proves to me she is more then a pretty face) is engaged to the jerk, Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Leo takes an immediate dislike to Eisenheim and sets out to 'explain' his tricks. Paul Giamatti is the police inspector who is in the Prince's pocket and does his dirty work for him. And who also knows about the Princes plan to overthrow his father and take over the country. Visually, the movie was absolutely beautiful. Filmed in the Czech Republic at some of the most fantastic locations, The Illusionist is a wonderful period piece, enhanced by great characters and acting, along with some nifty illusions, a splendid soundtrack, and an fun story. The movie flowed like a soft stream in a forest glen, unlike one or two other mysteries I could name but won't (cough cough Black Dahlia cough cough) that look like the Mississippi during spring runoff. It moves flawlessly along, clear and steady without muddying up the water with multiple plot lines that are simply confusing. I have always been a fan of Ed Norton, and have seldom seen him in anything that I did not enjoy. He has remarkable pacing, his presence in front of the camera is excellent and he has a voice that can't be confused. His role as Eisenheim was careful, studious and characterized by a boredom that would mimic easily the put upon showman simply trying to do his job and yet dealing with drones who don't or can't understand him or his work. Paul Giamatti however, has not been a favorite; I mean it is not like I would go out of my way to watch him. If he was in something I saw, he usually carried out his role as a shome or a nerd quite well, but I never saw him in a major role until now. He was magnificent as Chief Inspector Uhl, bringing to the role both comic relief and a sincerity that many actors have to force, but seemed to come easy to him here. Rufus Sewell was cast perfectly as Prince Leopold, and is excellent as the villain. Every time he is on the screen, you almost want to yell ""boo"" at the scene. Sewell comes across easily as the vain and power driven Prince who gloats that he is above the laws of men and the people around him. But what shocked me most was Biel, who is not just beautiful in this film but also shows more talent then she has ever shown me before. And yes, I do count; my opinion of her acting does matter since I am the one she is supposed to entertain. And so are you, and you. Well, maybe not you; the guy stoned and watching ""Jackass"" but most of the rest of us. I have seldom seen someone in this generation control her scenes the way Biel did here. She displays almost as much talent here as Norton did in some of his early roles most of all in Primal Fear. If she can continue like this we might just be looking at someone with a real future, not just someone who has to do a sex video every few years to stay in the limelight. <br/><br/>Neil Burger has presented us with a flat out remarkable film that is made even better by the music of Philip Glass, that fit the scenes and fill the screen with just the right amount of suspenseful foreboding. A love story, a mystery, an adventure all in one. This is what movie making is supposed to be about. And if Black Dahlia or Hollywoodland may get an Oscar mention, The Illusionist deserves to win."
"lolitamad","9","1","2","12 October 2006"," Very Good
","I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone. <br/><br/>My only beef is with casting. <br/><br/>Though Ms. Biel was very good, she was 10 years too YOUNG for the part. <br/><br/>Ed Norton is 37 and she is 13 years younger than he is, come on. <br/><br/>When she showed up as the present Sophie, I was taken out of the movie at the inconsistency.<br/><br/>Other than that point, the movie is really the cat and mouse game between Norton and Giamatti, and that is the pleasure of this picture.<br/><br/>It is a good, old fashion Hollywood movie and I will have to get a copy of it for my friends when it is release on DVD."

","My eye was drawn to this movie because it stars Ed Norton(who made his name in cult movie Fightclub) and Jessica Biel. <br/><br/>This movie is set in Vienna. It follows life of a brilliant man Eisenheim through eyes of local chief inspector. Norton portraits Eisenheim very beliavble and introduces us in the world of Austrian prince, dutchess and the magician.<br/><br/>The script is one of a kind, it truly moves us and creates illusions within us. It touched me, made me cry and laugh at the same time.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend watching this movie weather you believe in magic or not, this is a movie about a man who broke out of his world and amazed and deceived (in a good way) everyone."
"brentsoffcenter","9","1","2","3 October 2006"," An absolutely splendid story
","One of the overall finest movies in years, this story has all of the elements of an Oscar winning film. Since the only special effects in the movie are contained in the illusions themselves, this production stands on its own merits without the need of the extra sensations, and the bells and whistles that move most of todays cinematic efforts.<br/><br/>The ensemble acting, and in fact all of the scenes, are top quality. The sequences are all essential and meaningful parts combining to make a greater finished product. Attention to the ambiance of the era, costume and design, lighting, and especially the direction make for an excellent production. Very engrossing, and very entertaining.<br/><br/>Norton is, as always, engaging and skillful in his character. Eisenheim is more polished, more mature, caring, and powerful than is Norton's more common character role of Mr. Nasty. In this story, Norton does exceptionally well as the one being accused and victimized, while all the while remaining a gentleman, as opposed to being the one usually doing the victimizing in other portrayals. Likewise, we see very convincing portrayals from police chief Giamatti, Crown Prince Sewell, and romantic interest Biel. (And isn't she gorgeous in this role?).<br/><br/>At the ending of the story, even though the twist is just a little bit predictable, it is done with such polish that no one really cares and just applauds. The highlight of the production, as in all successful endeavors, is the combined effort of the entire company, the directorship, the technical crew, and the period research. Will there be a sequel? We hope so."
"bobbobwhite","8","1","2","25 September 2006"," Sepia-toned period thriller
","I enjoyed this beyond-magic thriller a lot, even though the ending was pretty easily determined ahead of time by any Conan Doyle aficionado of Sherlock Holmes mysteries due to close similarities to at least two of his stories. But, the film was so well done that it more or less overshadowed that obvious bit of copy-cat that gave the film a Sherlock Holmes mystery look and feel, and especially due to all the horse-and-buggy clop-clopping through the old city streets. I fully expected Sherlock to emerge from a buggy at any time, hot on the trail of the perp.<br/><br/>The sepia-toned filter used in all scenes gave it a perfect touch of faded age, and the Prague locations used provided the necessary quaint but regal 19th Century look of golden years class that few cities today can provide for horse and buggy age films. The film had a look of quality and class throughout and was mostly very accurate in its period details.<br/><br/>Edward Norton was terrific in his usual inscrutable-faced way as the magical illusionist carrying out his own illusion of a ""murder"" mystery, and Paul Giamatti continued to amaze me with his growing virtuosity in another demanding character piece, this time as a deadly serious but role-conflicted police chief trying to solve the Big mystery, more for his own satisfaction in the end than to bring the perps to eventual justice. The Scarlett Johannson-lipped Jennifer Biel was innocently effective as the main squeeze, but Rufus Sewell was a bit much and over the top in his overtly vicious villain role as the emperor's scheming nut-case son. Amusingly, his obviously fake mustache made me watch it in amazement all the time instead of watching him as he progressively chewed the scenery throughout his crazed evolution from a quietly jealous and pompous royal ass to a violently drunken and murderous maniac. Who else noticed his really bad fake mustache and why didn't the director catch it? <br/><br/>Most of the reviews here are very enthusiastic and are mostly well deserved as it was a fine film, but if you know Sherlock Holmes' stories well you will have the ending figured out far before it actually ends and that will away take a bit of your overall enjoyment."
"chefmoviebuff","8","1","2","24 September 2006"," Sure to divide audiences
","This is a film that should not be viewed alone. There is much going on in this film that it is bound to start a debate.<br/><br/>I saw this film with my spouse and what was interesting was that even though we both enjoyed the film, we still had a heated debate.<br/><br/>Before I get into that, I must stress the quality and professionalism of this film. Everyone involved proved to be up to the task in this challenging picture. Edward Norton and Phillip Glass are in peek form. The former shows skill, commitment and passion in his role; he is completely believable and often stunning in his performance. The music score in my mind could not have been more perfect. Like the film itself, it is mysterious, hypnotic, modern yet appropriate to the setting of the tale. The music at it's best isn't even noticed, rather heightens the mood and the suspense.<br/><br/>Though my wife and I agreed on all these points, she enjoyed the ending and resolution more than I. I found the weakest part of the film was it's climax: Eisenheim's disappearance from the stage and from Vienna. I believe that an explanation is needed here. An explanation of how Eisenheim is able to fool the entire city and escape completely unnoticed. This is a major plot point that is not clarified; instead, left in the dark along with all the other illusions. My wife disagrees. She argues that it is part of the mystery and a reveal would ruin the suspension of disbelief. In fact, if the filmmakers did explicate the illusions (particularly the phantoms), it would feel cheap and boring. She would have felt she was spoon fed the plot.<br/><br/>I think that in a film, when you build to climax, place your protagonist in peril, you need to explain how the character escapes. When James Bond or other super spies are captured, it would feel silly if the audience are not shown how he gets away. My feeling is, not revealing how he escapes demonstrates lack of creativity.<br/><br/>Oh well. Can't agree on everything.<br/><br/>However, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it. It will certainly spark some debate."

","""The Illusionist"" is a nifty but rather strange film. It's a mystery whose central mystery, once revealed, isn't all that mysterious, yet the film manages to build an exciting amount of suspense anyway.<br/><br/>It's success, I think, lies in the fact that it builds a great deal of character development and character-driven subplots into the film, so that not everything hinges on how tricky you find the ending to be. As Paul Giamatti's police inspector character begins to connect the pieces of the puzzle in the film's climactic moments, it's more fun to watch his face responding to the trick than it is to see how the trick was pulled off in the first place.<br/><br/>Edward Norton, as usual, does a fine job as master magician Eisenheim, who meets his long-lost childhood love (Jessica Biel) ten years after they were parted and told they could never be together, due to class differences. From there, it's up to Eisenheim to pull off his most elaborate illusion yet, and make them ""disappear,"" as his young love asks him to do early in the film. But where does reality end and illusion begin? The film plays with that question in what is mostly pot-boiler fashion while giving it just enough intellectual trimmings (talk about the soul, etc.) to satisfy those who want a little meat with their thrillers.<br/><br/>And Philip Glass provides a musical score that sounds for all the world like the one he composed for ""The Hours,"" though what worked so well for that movie feels less suited for the material here.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","By all means, go and see this movie, once. It moved a little slowly, but compellingly to its conclusion. I saw some of the plot coming, but was completely blindsided by the ending. The acting is very good all round, and the sets and costumes have a feel of authenticity about them, as do the relationships between the aristocrats and the commoners who serve them. Paul Giammatti as the Chief Inspector is completely believable in his role, especially when he inwardly seethes at the restrictions placed on his investigations by the aristocracy. Norton is intense and passionate, a young man skilled beyond his years, working inexorably towards his goal.<br/><br/>I felt that, on the whole, this played more like a TV movie than a theatrical one.

"amacsween","9","1","2","10 September 2006"," If you don't appreciate the efforts of the Actors then it would be an insult to comment on this movie
","The Illusionist was set in a unique environment as a period piece compared to many of the modern set movies. While the plot was good and there were some plot twists, the movie was somewhat standardized and technical. The Illusionist did keep true to its name by resolving the ending with both illusion and a man's need for a rational explanation. It could have been longer with more character development but due to the setting many unappreciative viewers would have been lost.<br/><br/>Overall both Edward Norton and Jessica Biel did an excellent job. Edward showed a seriousness not seen since American History X. He studied hard for the role and it showed in his face and his mannerisms. He pulled off the role quite convincingly as a ""magician"" who truly believed what is was doing and provided doubt for the audience to keep them interested.<br/><br/>Jessica was finally able to show the emotional and linguistical range that she is capable of. She showed strength and bottled up emotion of a duchess who was caught between an engagement of power and love. However, Jessica still did not get enough screen time similar to Elizabethtown. The only two movies were Jessica acquired enough screen time was in Stealth and Blade: Trinity. Those movies however were both action types which was a breakout role from her TV series. The Illusionist will allow her to gain appreciation for her skills and her upcoming comedy with Adam Sandler will be fun to watch.<br/><br/>Based on the acting alone the movie was excellent. Great job Edward, Paul, and Jessica."

No way.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti isn't exactly a firebrand either despite being totally brilliant in ""The Cinderella Man."" And so, in ""The Illusionist"" we have two rather boring actors who could have put the entire theater to sleep had it not been for two things--an OUTSTANDING plot and a magnificently manufactured atmosphere of 1900 Vienna. Mix them together, wave a magic wand, up comes a bit of smoke and presto, we have an eight out of ten film.<br/><br/>Highly entertaining albeit a mite draggy in spots but still worth the viewer's time and money.

","This independent release (Yari Films) is lovely to behold, with soft cinematography, lush landscapes and wonderful acting; all of which makes up for the average love/revenge story and a half-hearted attempt to be a latter-day ""Usual Suspects."" That being written, however, I did enjoy the viewing experience, and believe most thinking film-goers will also.<br/><br/>Based on a short story, ""Eisenhiem, The Illusionist,"" by Steven Millhauser, the movie does wrap itself around you, creating a shroud of mystery that could easily be mistaken for confusion to the casual observer.<br/><br/>Edward Norton (""Fight Club,"" ""The Italian Job"") plays the title role,a gifted magician (during the reign of the Habsburgs in Austro-Hungary) who falls in love with a girl, Sophia (Jennifer Biel), many steps above him socially. When the parents force them apart, he goes off and hones his craft, traveling the world, seeking the ultimate mystery. He entertains crowds with a brilliant, but lightweight magic show, making enough money to live well, but secretly longs for his unrequited love.<br/><br/>Later, while performing in Veinna, he sees Sophie again, although this time she's engaged to the nasty Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, ""Tristan + Isolde,"" ""The Legend Of Zorro""), who gives a new twist to 19th century domestic violence. The two lovers, despite the danger involved, continue their torrid love affair from where they left off, but Leopold's spies, including the spineless police inspector, Uhl (Paul Giamatti, ""Lady in the Water,"" a voice in ""The Ant Bully""), watch her every move.<br/><br/>When the prince murders her while in a drunken rage, Eisenheim changes his act. Instead of making doves appear or pulling rabbits out of hats, he is seemingly able to produce the spirits of departed individuals to the astonished patrons. These are genuinely creepy scenes, and much more spine-tingling than the garbage coming out films like ""Descent"" or ""Pulse."" On a night in which Leopold shows up (in disguise), Eisenheim even conjures up the disembodied ghost of Sophie, who all but accuses the prince of murder.<br/><br/>Incensed at the accusations and public ridicule they are bringing, Leopold orders the magician arrested; but when the constabulary closes in, the crafty Eisenheim has other plans, promptly disappearing before their eyes. Like the headliner's act, however, all is not what it seems. Director Neil Burger (""Interview With An Assassin"") throws us a little twist, with no small thanks to Bryan Singer, but that little diversion does not ruin the film, for me at least. It's just not that much of a surprise when you think about it.<br/><br/>Acting, especially Norton, Sewell and Giamatti, is top-notch, while even Beil (I had my doubts, just watch ""Seventh Heaven"" or ""Stealth"") did not disappoint. The lensing by Dick Pope (""Nicholas Nickelby,"" ""Vera Drake"") is exceptional and, as a period piece, it is extremely well-done with great attention paid to detail (I mean who couldn't enjoy a movie dealing with the intrigues of Austrian Emperor Franz Josef's gaggle of inbred idiotic offspring?).<br/><br/>The best of that genre since Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux in the 1937 classic, ""Mayerling."""

"buckeyemel76","9","1","3","1 November 2013"," The art of illusion is limitless, one cannot rely on intellect to comprehend its mysteries.
","Neil Burger's adaptation of Steven Millhauser's short story, ""Eisenheim the Illusionist"", is a delight for the senses. Often a rarity in modern filmmaking, Burger is able to engage the intellect, the sight, the sound, and the emotion in this film. The theme can be viewed as nothing is always as it seems meets true love will always find a way. For the purpose of this review and in order not to have a spoiler, I will focus on the former rather than the latter. <br/><br/>Eduard Abramovich (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) was a cabinet maker's son, who by chance came upon a magician one day. The magician intrigued the boy immensely; so much so, that he devoted all of his time from that day on to learning the art of magic and illusion. He falls in love with a rich duchess named Sophie Von Teschen (Eleanor Tomlinson), but there young love is forbidden. She is bound by family duty, he is bound by her heart. They are torn apart, but not before he makes her a secret token of his affection. For 15 years, he travels afar in search of great mysteries, only to return with a new name and a mastery of the art of illusion. Eduard is now Herr Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and is performing in Vienna, Austria. Dutchess Von Teschen (Jessica Biel) is now in the company of the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), plotting to overthrow his father, the Emperor, and take the throne. Eisenheim performs at a local theater where the Crown Prince volunteers Sophie for a demonstration. As she takes the stage, Sophie and Eisenheim are entranced but for a moment; both in awe, but undeniably covered in a blanket of familiarity of times that transcend the lack of words that fail to reach their lips. At that moment, it is as if the spark that had dimmed from their childhood love had become ablaze once more. The Crown Prince does not like not knowing how the performances are explained and he is jealous of Eisenheim's popularity. He sets Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) on a mission to shut Eisenheim down, promising him promotions to Chief of Police or Mayor of Vienna when he is Emperor. Uhl, however, is impressed by Eisenheim's abilities and feels he is of no real threat to anyone. Uhl succumbs to Prince Leopold's wishes, but ultimately has to decide between promotion and ethics. <br/><br/>One thing is to be remembered, in an illusion, nothing is as it seems. This theme is recurrent throughout the film. From the interactions between the characters, to what you come to think you can expect from them, you are surprised at every turn. There are no stereotypical performances from this star-studded cast. The chemistry between Edward Norton and Jessica Biel is nothing short of convincing. Norton shows such concentration, conviction, and devotion. He was believably Eisenheim and as whom, supported the theme by being completely unpredictable. His facial expressions and body language made me believe he internalized everything and one never knew what he was truly thinking. Biel, Giamatti, and Sewell were unpredictable in imperative scenes as well. I truly cannot imagine any other actors in these roles. They gave stellar performances. They deserve much more credit than I have time to give. <br/><br/>The lighting, filters, film structure, and camera angles all played important roles as well. Most of the lighting was rich and warm. It gave the feeling of romance and comfort. The only time I recall it being very different is in scenes at the Crown Prince's home. The lighting seemed brighter, seemingly making the Prince seem harsher. The film's non-linear structure intensifies the engagement of the viewer's intellect. It pulls you deeper into the film. Going deeper proves to enhance the emotional connection, along with the visual and auditory stimulation. There are a lot of flashbacks in the beginning, in which the camera operator uses a technique that darkens the four corners of the screen, comparable to an old photograph.<br/><br/>The Illusionist (Burger, 2006) is one of those movies that I have seen multiple times and will watch many more times over. Its theme is universal: it will always apply to viewers. Being that it has a little bit of everything in it: romance, thriller, and mystery; I think that it will attract and be enjoyed by many different types of viewers."

","Give ""The Illiusionist"" credit for being a pretty good period piece, which seems to recreate Hapsburg Austria pretty faithfully (notwithstanding the fact that there was no ""Crown Prince Leopold"" - a character apparently loosely based on the real-life Crown Prince Rudolf) and also for having some pretty strong performances - especially from Edward Norton as Eisenheim, and from Paul Giambatti as Inspector Uhl. Those couple of positive notes, though, weren't enough to save a bizarre and confusing story which tries to mix a magician's tricks with a murder mystery.<br/><br/>Essentially, Eisenheim gets entangled in the murder of Sophie (Jessica Biel), a woman engaged to the Crown Prince but who, in the past, was passionately in love with Eisenheim himself. She ends up being murdered, and Eisenheim is convinced that Leopold is responsible. The movie never explicitly identifies Leopold as the murderer, but it is clearly implied. Significant parts of the movie are told in flashbacks, especially near the beginning as the past relationship between Eisenheim and Sophie is portrayed. I thought the story was weak and lacked any real sense of excitement; anything that would grab a viewer and really pull them in. Because of the positive points I mentioned at the beginning, I'll rate this as a 3/10."

"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","1 December 2007"," Not necessarily a one trick pony but not far off.
","The Illusionist got me thinking; reminiscing, if you like about a filmmaker called Georges Méliés who was a trickster come entertainer at the turn of the twentieth century. He made hundreds of films between about 1890 to apparently 1913 that fell into a long since dead genre: 'trick'. There can be no doubt that Méliés had a massive impact and inspiration on the science fiction genre as well as other filmmakers as a whole all those decades ago with his bamboozling images and expansive imagination. There was one such short from Méliés that had me remembering during The Illusionist and that was the one in which a person stands in front of the camera; there is a 'cut' and they are then gone from the frame thus vanishing. I'm sure audiences in the day were completely perplexed and murmuring amongst one another in the same vein they do at Eisenheim's (Norton) tricks in this film but that's the hook: we now know that Méliés merely used a 'jumpcut' to vanish the person just as we know now that there is no such thing as magic or supernatural powers so any 'wow factor' The Illusionist as film has is actually pretty vacant.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people 'love' this film because of its cinematography; its effects and because Edward Norton and Jessica Biel are in it and they share some sort of romance but I feel they're kidding themselves as its like watching Méliés' films nowadays and being aghast at what he achieves even if the knowledge now is common. The 'trick film' genre may be long since dead but demand for period drama romance films that have twist endings seemingly are not. The Illusionist is impressive in its basics and its fundamental areas but it felt like a big ball of gas ever expanding before going out with a 'pop' rather than an almighty 'bang'. Firstly, I was under no illusion (no pun intended) that what I was seeing was mere CGI to myself and a mere illusion to the audience within the film. It is humanely impossible to achieve the things that Eisenheim did in this film and no, I couldn't even let my mind relax and enjoy it for what it was: an escapists dream in a world where magic exists. What the film does is challenge you into thinking: 'what can filmmakers achieve these days vs. what can actually be achieved in real life.' No; orange trees can't grow into adults in ten seconds; people can't bring back images of the dead and when you look into a mirror, you'll see yourself looking back. With this in mind, any clever twist or devious trick the film has up its sleeve is consequently a letdown if you opt for the first option in the quandary: 'what can filmmakers achieve these days vs. what can actually be achieved in real life.' <br/><br/>If anything, it's the editing that makes the film look more spectacular than it does but then again; editing can make anything look believable or spectacular: did people back in 1905 or whenever REALLY think Méliés made a person vanish on screen? Likewise, when audiences watched a train speed towards the camera in the late 1890s and some of them ducked out the way, some of them might have been a little 'aware' of the situation but watching The Illusionist in 2006, haven't we learnt anything about 'what we see vs. what we believe is really happening/is really possible.'? To the people who loved this film: obviously not. The Illusionist may have its actual premise as a flawed piece of historical context involving cinema, magic and genre but for what it is as a film, it works. The lead character of Eisenheim is a rounded and likable guy who falls for a girl he is clearly in no position to get; something a few people watching will be able to relate to. What follows is a tricky and devious narrative; something that resembles a snake crawling calmly along and then suffering a seizure towards the very end and wriggling all over the place. The antagonistic behaviour of Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell) who has bigger plans than that of his bride to be and secret love of Eisenheim Sophie (Biel); is an effective villain who demeans and threatens Eisenheim not solely because of his tricks that appeal to everyone but because he is at risk of becoming second-best public figure to a fraud: ""For anyone wanting to discuss a more serious topic, join me for a drink."" he announces on Eisenheim's stage right after a show.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about The Illusionist isn't necessarily what I didn't enjoy. The story of a love triangle is dumped for that of a detective route about half way through with certain events although surprising, you can't help but feel will pop back up later on. I don't know if it was the brilliant acting of Norton portraying Eisenheim or the film overall but something felt arrogant; something felt as if it was just going to force you into thinking it was a good film rather than you making your own mind up and this is emphasised in the closing scene at the train station where a certain character works everything out just when he needs to. This scene plays out in a messy way and I am still unsure about how all those memories and flashbacks would come to him there and then at the station all at once and never before  it tries to be The Usual Suspects when Dave Kujan stands on the police station steps; cursing to himself but the build up and the payoff is just not of that quality. The Illusionist works as a piece of entertainment but lacks any real depth if you look deep enough; like a typical magicians trick: you see it and smirk to yourself but it doesn't stay with you in the long run."
"nihao","3","1","3","25 June 2007"," Weakness at the heart of THIS Illusion
","How two talented actors stumbled into this mess, how another got out in time (by the skin of her teeth), and how all was messily (and slyly) resolved in the last minute of the film. So Edward Norton made me feel uncomfortable... but not thanks to his magic skills, as I had eluded myself... Rather I wanted him to take the first plane out of this trashy melodrama and save his screen reputation. Instead he stuck with it, with his flimsy voice, shaky pseudo English (at times Austrian?) accent, and childish plot and direction. Weak. That is how he seemed to feel. And that's no good feeling for an actor in the middle of a film. Something like remembering you can't swim as well as you thought, as a storm whips up at sea. Giammati slipped out of this with only the shame of having been IN this mess. 'Sideways' and 'American Splendor' save him, and will remain his little jewels. Viewers who admire the setting (Prague) and romance can Czec, oops, check out Canone Inverso (Inverse Cannon) a late-nineties Italian Box Office hit which is just as ludicrous as this fare but at least came first. The Illusionist is a copy of this other film with a couple of magic tricks extra. Locations, shots and... even the LEAD ACTRESS are straight out of the Italian movie. We are led to wonder what ever eluded Mr.Burger (yes, the director's name)into thinking he could pull this trick off. Luckily MOST awful experiences have an UP side. The young illusionist's encounter with his first wizard (by the roadside) is actually quite compelling, AND Liv Tyler got out of doing this movie just in time... much to her favour. The Moral IS... Burgers are BAD for your digestion; that is, unlike you LOVE fast-food. (p.s.

Edward Norton plays a gifted young magician who must save Jessica Biel's young duchess from the evil upper-class boyfriend who is the crown prince. Seems ol' poor boy's shared love with rich pretty lady is controversial in its time, and now he has to use all his tricks of illusion and sleight-of-hand to save her from marrying the evil guy who's not only a jerk, but planning to overthrow the throne as well! Now, all this could possibly be interesting if it weren't for the fact that the first scene pretty much gives away the first half of the movie, and then the first half definitely gives away the second. I find it to be a sign of pretty bad storytelling if a movie that subsists on tricks and illusions is always at least two scenes behind me.<br/><br/>That would also possibly be acceptable mostly because of good performance. Edward Norton does well. Paul Giamatti does what he does best. Biel and who's-his-face who played the crown prince sucked, and worse, the script pretty much assumed we already detested the boyfriend for whatever reason and only provided a few examples (eh, I suppose he was rude), and missed out on what could have been an intriguing battle of the wits between the two enemies.<br/><br/>So you have Norton and Giamatti acting really well in a brown movie. Okay.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB Favorite Quote: ""The sword to its rightful owner!"" Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","The unique mileage Edward Norton and company get out of this period piece mystery does have it's merits. Sequences in which the enigmatic magician conjures his intriguing imagery inside many of the murky, though classy stage setups remain the overriding soul of this movie despite any romantic developments or late act revelations. The heavily accentuated ambiance prevalent in those scenes does wonders to elevate the interesting but somehow gimmicky character study that at least the first half of this movie purports to be, replacing Norton's questionable interpretation of the work with some authentic scenes that bristle with the kind of on-screen magic this illusionist was trying to represent to his audience. In this aspect writer and director Neil Burger has succeeded in giving viewers some of the most original entertainment of the year. Unfortunately, the majority of the remaining plot to divulge does not necessarily complement the highlights, and often pales in comparison to the original set of aesthetic values placed on the actual stage performance of The Illusionist. While Burger does weave a passionate love story around the magic, one can't help but think all the romance, action, and conflict surrounding this script feels sort of tacked on to the one trick pony that it really is. Acting is uniformly decent, with even the likes of Jessica Biel wearing her role somewhat convincingly, although it did seem like Norton was a bit lost with how to interpret this different character, too many times relying on a vacant blandness that has all but consumed the latter half of his acting career. Undervalued Rufus Sewell added that much needed edge, while the always good Paul Giamatti surely impresses with his refined technique, but needs to revert more to doing what he does best, playing the types of roles that got him big in the first place, ala Sideways, and not trying to be so well rounded in his movie choices- an admirable goal for any actor, but in his case a discredit to what he does best. Overall this is a worthy film to see, although more for conceptual originality then for any actual originality to be found in the script."

","This is a well made movie. The actors, producers and the director did what they could with a very weak storyline/concept. Having said that, it is like saying Chad Pennington (of the New York Jets) is a good quarterback because he plays so well with his very limited abilities. He is good but there is no good reason to go watch him over Tom Brady, a superior player who gets maximum benefit out of his superior abilities.<br/><br/>The storyline is weak because the movie claims the illusionist performs illusions *AND HAS NO SUPERNATURAL POWERS* However, no illusionist a hundred years ago (or any since then) can perform most of the tricks he performed. These tricks can not be ignored because they are central to the movie and the plot can't exist without his ability to do them.<br/><br/>In this case, I believe the writer must pick a side. Either the illusionist has supernatural powers and therefore, all of this makes perfect sense or he performs illusions in which case the illusions must have been performed by someone somewhere in the course of history. This approach of I'll have my cake and eat it too is simply an insult to the intelligence of the astute movie-goer."

The final twist is badly written and Burger chose the easy way here, with no creativity nor subtlety whatsoever.<br/><br/>Too bad then because the director/writer's intentions were probably laudable, and though the movie is pretty enjoyable to watch, in the end it turns out to be flat and bland, far from the reference that is Nolan's The Prestige."

"nived84","5","1","4","30 September 2006"," Mysteriously lacking movie magic
","The Illusionist isn't the worst film I've seen all year, but it certainly is the frontrunner for being the most boring and emotionally disconnected. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim an illusionist who has returned to Vienna to win back the love of his life, Sophie (Jessica Biel) from Crown Price Peopold, played by Rufus Sewell, in serious douchebag mode. But when the Prince learns of Eisenheim and Sophie's relationship he tries to have him locked up, with the help of Chief Inspector Uhl, played by well by the always amazing Paul Giamatti, but the powerful illusionist uses his mysterious ways to bring down the Prince and reclaim the woman of his dreams. That's pretty much the gist of what The Illusionist is all about. On paper it's an interesting and well constructed romantic mystery, but on film it sorely lacks one important component that is needed to bring all the pieces together - chemistry.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Norton and Biel isn't present enough to build up a relationship worth investing in. Individually the performances are all fine, but the passion that connects them just isn't there. It's the kind of thing that can make or break a film like The Illusionist, and in this case the film comes off so disconnected and flat that I just wasn't hypnotized by the film's plot. I saw the film's magic, but alas I did not feel it. However the film does have some good performances (kudos to Norton for playing mysterious very well) and the sets and costumes. The film also manages to put together a pretty decent surprise ending, but looking back on it now it's seems so obvious, I actually feel rather stupid for actually falling for it.<br/><br/>Music can have a massive impact on how a film is interpreted and experienced. Sometimes if a musical score is too prominent or overly submissive it crushes a particular scene, killing any or all drama from the performances. A lot of the times it's the horror genre that goes overboard with the musical score. The Illusionist may in fact be the first serious drama that I've seen where an abnormal lack of a dramatic score actually hurts the film as a whole; giving the film a sense of emptiness and ultimately one of boredom. I'm actually quite surprised in a lot of the highly positive reviews for this one. I think at best, The Illusionist is okay, but nothing more. Perhaps in the hands of a more experienced director like Martin Scorsese or Ridley Scott I would have been more emotionally swept away with the film's magical mischief. I say skip this and wait until Christopher Nolan unleashes The Prestige later this month. Now that's one magic trick I can't wait to take part in!"

","The formula: combine the kind of visual feast made possible by modern digital effects and expensive costumes and scenery with some of the better actors of this generation, people like Paul Giamatti and Edward Norton. Throw them into a murder mystery with magic tricks. The result: a less than mediocre film that challenges its audience's patience and intelligence at every turn.<br/><br/>Norton plays Eisenheim, a turn of the century magician in Europe who finds his long lost love, Sophie (Jessica Biel) just as she's about to become married to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). They set in motion a complex plot to free her from his clutches, all the time watched by the Prince's loyal police Inspector Uhl (Giamatti).<br/><br/>This movie started to alienate me right from the very beginning with the unconvincing and overly showy special effects for the magic tricks. I think it's important to at least make the audience believe that we're watching actual magic tricks that could have been done at the time this movie was set. Instead what we see looks more like a digital version of ""Slimer"" from the Ghostbusters. The quality of Eisenheim's magic tricks are approximately matched by the quality of Uhl's ""detecting"". The quality of the mystery itself is so thin that any person with even the most basic skills in detective films could figure it out, but Uhl only figures it out at the very end in a sudden rush of elation. It's one of the movie's weakest points, where everything is revealed in this rush of a montage that basically tells us: ""hey, if you're as smart as Uhl, then you must have been fooled by this movie."" Instead of misdirection, the film simply leaves out elements that would have made the mystery even more obvious.<br/><br/>I have very little more to say about it. Never at any point in watching the movie was I more than moderately entertained. I did enjoy Giamatti's performance. I thought Biel's performance was about on the level of the average made for cable movie. Norton's performance was a misfire, far too understated. And poor Rufus Sewell, who is a good actor, was directed in such a way that you'd think he was playing to the back rows. The director of this movie has a pitiful understanding of how to work with the actors he was presented with. It's his good fortune that Giamatti was able to salvage something from it. The production design is pleasant, but sort of monotonous. There should be more of a contrast between the look of the slums and of the palaces, but everything in this film was photographed in a really bland way.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" is the most offensive kind of ""serious"" film -- a magic trick that truly is just a trick, with no movie magic."

On the downside I thought it lacked a little emotion to engage the audience. However, what really bugged me was the obvious age gap between Norton and Biel. When they are younger they look of similar age then when they reunite he looks mid-to-late thirties and she looks about ten years younger. So I checked the actors ages: Norton b. 1969 and Biel b. 1982! Last time it was that noticeable was Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang where there was a good 10 years between Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan.

Hecate in Macbeth<br/><br/>Romantic Vienna circa 1900, Crown Prince Leopold is too smart his lover says and Eisenheim the Illusionist may be even smarter. Director Neil Burger creates an entertaining and rich tapestry of sets and costumes to enhance the heavily woven plot that pits star-crossed lovers from different classes and thrusts the chief of police squarely between the crown and the magic. Phillip Glass's minimalist music is an effective counterpoint to the intricate décor.<br/><br/>When Eisenheim (Edward Norton) entertains the prince (Rufus Sewall), not only is the first half of the film mesmerizing (literally and figuratively), but it is also charged with challenges as the prince wants to know Eisenheim's secrets, the biggest of all being Eisenheim's childhood friendship with Sophie (Jessica Biel), a renewed relationship with potential for much more.<br/><br/>Once the film establishes the combatants, the chief (Paul Giamatti) is a referee with a growing conscience. Giamatti once again inhabits a role with bulging, darting eyes that say much more than dialog ever could. At any rate, the last half of the film devolves into intrigue telegraphed by the director, at odds with the whole theme of illusion. In effect, we know too much to keep a sense of wonder established by the early stage performances of impressive magic tricks.<br/><br/>Lost to us as well is the innocence that made us believe all we see in film, the greatest illusionist of all time. But then, love is for some an illusion, for others a reality too hard to bear. The Illusionist shows us both sides, and we're never certain where the truth lies.

","So is this a mystery film, a fantasy film, or what? Well, rather than successfully blurring the boundaries of genre, this film just seems to be a confused muddle of several genres, including the period piece. It's actually hard to speak in much detail about the film without spoiling it. What I will say is that while I enjoyed the character who played the main role in the film, I felt that some more focus on the other characters might have made the goings-on more meaningful. I also felt that the film suffers greatly right up until the ending, as it starts to appear even more pointless than it really is just for the sake of an interesting ending. While the ""German"" accents of the Austrian characters are actually not half-bad, they are still woefully unnecessary (if you want it to be authentic, film it in German!). Finally, there's the ""small"" matter of using Asian people as props in search of some mystical shorthand; I think it would be disingenuous to say that this is only supposed to work within the film. Overall, while not a painful experience, it was largely forgettable and not as clever as it was meant to be."
"hawrnball","5","1","10","16 September 2006"," Utterly disappointing
","This film lacked ambition. The director seems so determined to make everything as perfect as possible that the film is almost aware of itself. It doesn't take any risks, pull any punches, take viewers by surprise. Even the twist was somewhat predictable and underwhelming, anticlimactic. The Illusionist should have been as mystifying as seeing Eisenheim perform in person. Instead, the result is lackluster, dull, unimpressive. The viewer is almost forbidden to connect with the film on an emotional level. The film doesn't instill the viewer with a sense of wonder, like Eisenheim did with his audiences.<br/><br/>The film's progression is disjointed and the editing shares blame for that--if I had to see one more scene opening with the ""iris"" cut I was going to vomit. We're introduced to Eisenheim before he is almost arrested. We don't know anything about him and aren't given the chance to be hypnotized by his feats before the film abruptly flashes back to how he became involved in the magical arts. His blooming affection for Sophie zips by on the screen and we don't even get the chance to sympathize with their plights of class separation, or even care when they're forbidden to see each other. At some point in the second act the film slows to a snail's pace. There's not even a moment where the director could have livened things up a bit with some background music (that was a rather bittersweet feeling because I didn't care for the score but I'll get to that later) to maybe create some tension. What unfolds in the film is supposed to be tense and relatively exciting but I didn't perceive it as such because of a lack of music, static camera angles, and monotone actors that sound like they're reading off cue cards. There are several scenes at this point in the film that aren't very cohesive. They don't connect with each other. It's as if the director is saying, ""Okay, here's one scene. That's done, moving on the next one. Okay, moving on."" It's like reading a poorly written essay where the paragraphs don't flow into one another. The lack of cohesion in this film is so frustrating.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the director seems uncertain of what he wants this film to be. We watch Edward Norton do magic tricks... then it's a story of forbidden love... then it's about a prince plotting to overthrow the empire... then it's about said prince and the chief of police seeking to expose Eisenheim as a fraud... then it's about Eisenheim rebelling against the monarchy. At some points we go so long without seeing the titular character that I began to wonder where the hell this film was going and if I should just give up and walk out. Those subplots weren't given a chance to thrive and some characters are so underdeveloped that we simply don't care about what happens next. If these subplots were more elaborated upon the film could have been almost brilliant.<br/><br/>As for the music, we have yet another repetitive, annoying score by Philip Glass that does nothing for what we're seeing on screen.<br/><br/>And the actors. Miscasting all over the place. Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell, Jessica Biel?! Are you serious? Ed Norton is good but he doesn't command the screen as he should. In the last third or so of the movie all he has left to do is sit on stage and stare intensely. Paul Giamatti can't retain his accent and he speaks with such a soft, monotonous voice that it almost put me to sleep. Come to think, I don't think he spoke above a mumble the entire film. Rufus Sewell was plain awful. That man should not be allowed to have scenes where he is angry and screams at people because he can't. do it. right. We he first blows up at Sophie (""IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ME!!!"") I almost busted up laughing. I just couldn't take him seriously. Not for a minute. Jessica Biel isn't bad but she isn't good either. I'm not sure how she got third billing because she's barely in the film. Her character is severely underwritten. None of the actors seemed like they were trying, like they were just reading from cue cards. None of them disappear into their roles and they just come off as celebrities playing a part in their token period piece flick. None of them even attempted to get more out of the script than was written. Too bland, too plain.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this film too after a friend of mine praised it so highly. But I was let down big time. Only decent traits were production design, costume design and the cinematography. Not much else to recommend after that. I'd give this one a 5 out of 10 and even then I think that's being pretty generous."

What really impressed me is the climax, and what a climax! if you haven't watched it yet, go and give it a watch now at least for once :)"

","There's a lot to recommend this movie. The performances are all excellent, in particular those of Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell, who clearly relish their succulent roles. The photography is outstanding, justly earning DOP Dick Pope an Oscar nomination. The story is intriguing and well-told by director/writer Neil Burger. By a third of the way through it dawns on you that the political thread of the plot is making a clever comment on the illusory nature of power. But as time passes this promising idea is forsaken, and the whole enterprise reveals itself be a soufflé that in its last five minutes collapses into a soggy disappointment."

","Having put off the Illusionist for some time, I am only now viewing it. Having seen the high ratings for the film, my expectations were high. While watching the film, I was at times very bored and was not near to caring for many of the characters. I can see why people enjoy the film, it seems well directed and acted, and the cinematography is wonderful. Overall it did not provide much entertainment and excitement.<br/><br/>The plot and pace are what killed the movie for me. In the first half it's fine, and necessary to really develop your characters and get the audience to invest in them. But by the time the murder occurs, the pacing hasn't changed at all. We know Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), though ordered to shut Norton down, is a good guy that wants to do the right thing; we know that Eisenheim (Ed Norton) is talented and ballsy; we know that they are in love; but at the point the film should kick things up a notch. Instead, the audience is treated to a full forty-five minutes of an excruciatingly slow re-hashing of these character and plot points.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Norton and Biel isn't present enough to build up a relationship worth investing in. Individually the performances are all fine, but the passion that connects them just isn't there. It's the kind of thing that can make or break a film like The Illusionist, and in this case the film comes off so disconnected and flat that I just wasn't hypnotized by the film's plot. I saw the film's magic, but alas I did not feel it. However the film does have some good performances (kudos to Norton for playing mysterious very well) and the sets and costumes. The film also manages to put together a pretty decent surprise ending, but looking back on it now it's seems so obvious, I actually feel rather stupid for actually falling for it."

","There is so much to admire in this Film. The Photography, Score, Performances, Story, and the overall different-ness. It is a tough sell these days, where Romance is set among Vampires and sinking Luxury Liners. But this is a timeless and well worn, but hardly irrelevant, Tale of Lovers not denied.<br/><br/>It is a sumptuous looking, hypnotic, and haunting Mystery that is so well handled and presented that it can, without apology, be labeled Cinematic Art. It combines all the elements that make up the celluloid canvas with a smooth, penetrating, and gorgeous appeal. <br/><br/>Using CGI for the Magic, some have said, is a totally unbelievable rendering of Stage Magicians, especially for the time-frame. But given that Audiences were not very sophisticated and could most likely be enthralled, if not totally captivated and persuaded by Mesmerism, as they were in Real-Life, this is absolutely believable. The visual persuasions, ala SFX, are here for 21st Century Movie Audiences.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fine example of Classical Storytelling and Entertainment that is mostly absent from current Hollywood releases and it is a Fun and rewarding experience. It crosses all Demographics and Group-Think, and can be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of wonder and a taste for imaginative innovations."

"Lejink","7","0","1","4 August 2012"," All done with mirrors
","An entertainingly old-fashioned historical mystery thriller (I think that covers it!), spiced up with magic and political intrigue. At heart a love story between a commoner (Edward Norton's Eisenheim character) and a noblewoman (Jessica Biel's Lady Sophie), their youthful affair is sundered by her outraged family. Fate brings them together again as adults at which point she is unwittingly and somewhat unwillingly being used as a political pawn in the machinations of Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) to usurp his father's throne and he has developed a reputation as a master illusionist. Her rekindled love for Eisenheim jeopardises the Prince's plans as well as stirring his jealousy, rendering the men implacable enemies, with the Prince employing his chief of police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) to discredit Eisenheim and ensure Sophie plays her part as his consort. How Eisenheim strikes back at the Prince with a daring new illusion forms the main suspense as the film reaches its conclusion.<br/><br/>Released at around the same time as Christopher Nolan's similarly themed and for me more confusing and overrated ""The Prestige"", I preferred the relative simplicity of the narrative here, with the characters' motivations being much easier to discern. Beautifully shot in golden suffused light to enhance the period detail, well acted by all concerned and with Philip Glass' compellinhly hypnotic score in the background, it looks like a well portrayed theatrical production, at times like watching a play within a play.<br/><br/>While the ending isn't hard to work out and the Police Chief's ""Eureka!"" moment somewhat contrived, still all the loose ends are conveniently explained and tied up by the end, making this a satisfying and easy on the eye entertainment."

I find watching over again things I missed the first many times that I had watched it. I really enjoy a film that entertains and yet makes me think.

Well, it seems to me that ""The Illusionist"" is totally overrated.<br/><br/>The acting is well, but you don't really feel this deep love between Jennifer Biel and Edward Norton. The story implicates a big love story, but the acting is rather distant. There is no room to see any character evolve, they all seemed pretty two-dimensional, which is probably why the actors couldn't show their abilities.<br/><br/>Additionally, the whole time I didn't know whether the viewer should believe that these tricks were actual magic tricks or some supernatural powers. Because it was all clearly done with CGI, I couldn't understand how you should imagine any way how this could be done in reality. In the end, the climax lacks a lot of explanation (and don't understand me wrong, I like open endings and mysteries, but here the film tries to explain, but very unsatisfying).<br/><br/>So, if you maybe consider watching this film because you like The Prestige and want to see a film with mysteries and a great story, i recommend not to waste your time."

","****READ THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM****<br/><br/>I will admit that I didn't figure out that Jessica Biel's character was alive at the end. I assumed she had really died. But part of it was due to slight of hand by the director. What bothered me after the explanation of what really happened was that I realized something was missing: The Funeral. When they find her body, it's just carted off and that's it. The whole thing then turns into a whodunit or at least they try to pin the murder on The Prince. But that's where it's a bit of a cheat, because she could not have run away without a funeral being held for her. Also, they took a big chance because a trial for the Prince would have resulted in people asking for an autopsy, if one wasn't done, or wondering what happened to the body. There are a lot of other plot devices that don't work, like how Eisenheim is conjuring up the images. He might be using a projector, but then how does that kid come from the street? So we're just left to assume he has some kind of supernatural power. I did enjoy watching this film, as I did with The Prestige. But while I was a little forgiving with The Prestige on it's own faults, I believe that the omission of what happened to the deceased woman's body and how that was overlooked by everyone was a huge plot hole that the director should have addressed."

","'The Illusionist' is a film that was often compared with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' which had a similar theme inspired from the life of the turn of the 20th century magicians and was released about the same time. It fails the comparison I am afraid.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the last decades of the Austro-Hungarian empire, where a magician of modest origins is using his skills to fight the system and win back his lost love who is to become the wife of the crown prince. The intrigue is quite simplistic and the characters around the main hero are all schematic, with the exception maybe of the chief police inspector played by Paul Giamatti who oscillates between fear and allegiance to the system on one side and curiosity and search for truth on the other side. So it falls upon Edward Norton to save the film, and he does it brightly. It's his best role until now in my opinion - he is dark and subtle, sensible and articulate. While 'The Prestige' will probably remain the better film about magicians of that year, Norton will stay as the better magician in the two films."

","I really enjoyed The Illusionist. A very well made movie, well acted and a great story. When I first recorded the movie, I must admit I had my doubts as to its suitability for me. I'm not exactly a 'magic man' type of guy to be honest but it soon won me over. <br/><br/>The pace, look and feel of the movie was splendid. A steady pace throughout and the film was shot in a subtle old-fashioned manner which I thoroughly enjoyed. <br/><br/>Edward Norton - as he is normally - is excellent here. His character a long lost love of a Duchess - the beautiful, radiant Jennifer Biel. I had never seen Biel in anything before this - but she is totally believable here and very pretty indeed. Giamatti - as the police inspector - is great too. His demeanour, walk and speech perfectly suited to the times and his position within the society of that era. That era involving the late 19th century Vienna is yet a further character in the story - exquisitely depicted and the attention to detail is second to none. <br/><br/>The name of the film gives the viewer a strong hint that not all is what it seems here and even though I knew something was going to twist, my enjoyment of the film was not stolen from me as I did not predict the ending. Other - more smarter - people I am sure will see it coming but in this instance it is nice to have that little bit of ignorance. There are a couple of plot points that maybe could have been expanded on a tad - to fully drive home the story - but I am nitpicking here.<br/><br/>To me - a superb film with great acting and fabulous sets and a solid story. What more could you ask for? 8/10."
"hasosch","10","0","2","23 October 2009"," The Autology of Illusionism
","Illusionism means basically that you must force yourself not to believe to be real what you see. However, for most people, this is a problem, because they define truth through their eye-sight: What I saw, is true, since I saw it (happen) with my own eyes. The whole witness-system of the world-wide police is based on this thoroughly illogical conception of truth. If you have the luck to meet an illusionist, what you see may be false because you see it with your own eyes - and opposite, it may be true because you must not believe in what you see.<br/><br/>However, there is another problem, and nowhere it is portrayed in a more illustrious way than in ""The Illusonist"" (2006): People who go to an illusionist's show, must assume from the beginning that what they will see is not true: the world ""illusion"" alone says it. However, if what they see is so strikingly convincing to be true, but now true against their better knowledge, then these people must be able to come behind the trick by which falseness is presented so splendidly as truth. Now, the reality looks so, that most people are unable to find out the trick. The do not only see - they look and watch (intentionally) - and they do not find a hint, although they know (or believe to know?) that what they see is false - so does this prove now that what they see is true? Here lies the main root of the superstition of people: Because they are unable to find out which the trick is that lets them believe the falseness for truth and vice versa, they rather convince themselves that there is no trick and start to believe what they see - as they do normally because they define to be true what they see. The movie shows this so simple and at the same time so complex mechanism of truth and falseness in the context of Illusionism in such a way that the audience gets the other public of Eisenheim - together with his proper public in his theaters. After all, the whole movie is itself an illusion - in order to find out why, you will have to watch the end carefully. Thus, this movie is what is called in logic auto-logical."

","http://mix.dailyevergreen.com/index.php?aid=29302 ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" were both phenomenal movies that received far less attention than they deserved. They made magic cool again, yet two blockbuster magic movies in one year may have canceled each other out. If you haven't seen these movies, I highly recommend renting or buying them.<br/><br/>Michael Caine's character in ""The Prestige"" explains that every great magic trick consists of three parts.<br/><br/>""The first part is called 'The Pledge.' The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called 'The Turn' – the magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary,"" his character says. ""But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough, you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige.'"" That is essentially what both movies are – great big magic tricks that will keep you guessing throughout the films. There are times during the movies where things get a bit slow, just like any magic trick, but the payoff at the end. The prestige is always worth it. As usual, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) does a near flawless directing job in ""The Prestige."" Two magicians, who begin as colleagues, become rivals after a tragedy. Their obsession with each other grows darker and more extreme as the film progresses. Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Wolverine) gives a great performance and creates the haunted charismatic Rupert Angier. Christian Bale (The Dark Knight, Batman) plays Alfred Borden the silent brooder. Acting all-star Michael Caine rounds out the trio as the experienced sage wise man caught in the middle.<br/><br/>On the other hand, ""The Illusionist"" focuses on a different obsession – forbidden love.<br/><br/>Edward Norton (Fight Club) is brilliant in his leading role as the mysterious Eizenheim the Illusionist. Despite my initial doubts, Jessica Biel (Seventh Heaven) gives a surprisingly solid performance as Norton's love interest, the Duchess Sophie. The chemistry between the two is very believable.<br/><br/>The conflict arises on several fronts. The Crown Prince already has plans to make Sophie his wife and grows enraged at her denial due to her feelings for the Illusionist. Paul Giamatti steals the show as Inspector Uhl, the man chosen by the Prince to shut Eisenheim down. His performance as a man torn between his duty and his own fascination of the Illusionist's many tricks is wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>""The Prestige"" is the better film. It had superb directing and a better plot. Yet at the same time, ""The Illusionist"" was a more enjoyable film experience. Giamatti and Norton rival Caine, and they completely outclass Bale and Jackman. ""The Prestige"" is dark, and for some, perhaps too dark. The magicians are so unlikeable at times that it is easy to stop caring about what happens to them anymore. ""The Illusionist"" has better pacing than ""The Prestige"" and doesn't veer into the absurd and unlikely.<br/><br/>Both movies are fantastic and either one is worth multiple viewings. They are similar but also very different. It just depends on the individual as to which one is better. However, both will make you believe in magic."

","Read other IMDb member comments here and yet again they seem to go to extremes. The fact is that The Illusionist is not brilliant but not bad either. On the downside, it is all rather hammy, from the cod German accents to the impeccably clean Viennese streets which remain in a pristine condition despite the many horses travelling the city streets, from the convenient meetings to the several jarring modernisms (in the stuffy world of Austro-Hungarian royalty, the Duchess would never have been allowed to be alone with the Prince). And yet who cares? On the upside the Illusionist is an old piece of hokum which will entertain you for a while and is better than many other films. If I were picky, I would also remark that in The Illusionist is a far better and far more interesting film waiting to be made, but in the meantime all we have is this. You might probably catch it on TV one of these nights. Toss a coin - heads you watch, tails you don't. Oh, what the hell. As long as you don't expect art or some such high-falutin tosh, you'll be reasonably entertained. And Ed Norton is always worth the price of admission, even in such middle-brow hokum as this. Oddly the film seems to have been summed up in the rather ludicrous disguise the illusionist adopts right at the end of the film when he catches his train.

","""The Illusionist"" is an interesting period piece set in turn-of-the-century Vienna. It centers around a magician (Edward Norton) who becomes enmeshed in political intrigue when his highborn lover (Jessica Biel) becomes engaged to the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell).<br/><br/>I have long been a fan of Norton's but for some reason he seemed slightly out of place here. Strangely, Paul Giamatti, whom I expected might seem out of place was in fact ideally suited to his role. Nevertheless, Norton does deliver a skillful performance, as do the other principle actors, namely Giamatti, Biel & Sewell.<br/><br/>The script grabbed my attention with a mix of political intrigue, phantasmagoria and romantic pursuit. However, I did get the feeling that the story was stretched just a little too thin in the long run, which is not so surprising considering that the source material is only of short story length. It is also worth noting that the story is noticeably slight in comparison to the similarly-themed film ""The Prestige"".<br/><br/>The direction and score are ably handled but not especially noteworthy. The effects surrounding the various magic tricks are well done if not exactly breathtaking. More importantly they are not overemphasized to the point of detracting from the story.<br/><br/>In the end, I found the film enjoyable as a whole.

","This is pretty much the same movie as that other conjuring movie which popped out of Hollywood's hat around the same time. It's not the same story, but the same movie, with (1) the same twist ending, which is obvious, once one thinks about it (and is probably the ending to every conjuring story ever written); (2) an atmosphere approximating, but only approximating, that of its subject; (3) some cheating on the first rule of conjuring stories not magical fantasies, that all the tricks must be rationally explainable; and (4) a lot of sepia (from the time before things were colored normally). <br/><br/>However, this movie differs from the other in featuring (1) leading actors who are less fittingly cast and speak in funny accents, which hinder the suspension of disbelief; (2) an even more artificial design, but with it (3) some more striking images; and (4) a clearer, simpler, and therefore more interesting story, but with it (5) an ending that brings in one or two too many irrelevant flashbacks, thereby becoming unclear, and seeming to be a cheat when it isn't (I _think_, having just belatedly worked the whole thing out). <br/><br/>For me the main drawback of both movies (or of any movie of the same type) is that I never could believe the characters were the greatest conjurers ever seen, or (granting for the stories' sake that they were) understand why they would be. I think that may be a literary idea, conveyable in a novel but showing its speciousness in a movie. And in the end, it's the only idea conveyed, so the viewer has gained nothing by granting it for the story's sake: it _is_ the story.<br/><br/>Moreover, I wonder whether it isn't a bit of a fake, this conceit of the miraculous mandarin-magician.

If you've heard any of Phillip Glass' music this sure won't surprise you. The whole thing just felt contrived and obvious. Actual line: ""Why don't you just leave him?"" ""It's not that simple""... Now there's an original sentiment. The ending was obvious from about 30 minutes into it, then they spent 3 minutes with the requisite montage with all the ""clues"" that we missed even though it's a shock to no one that !gasp! she faked her death. Yawn. What really got my goat was that all of the ""magic"" was really jangly CGI that looked horrible. The one decent looking trick was the ghost thing which A) was impossible and B) the filmmaker made absolutely no attempt to explain. If he could perform an amazing illusion like that, you think he could come up with a better way of escaping the prince than spilling some fake blood and knocking some rubies off a sword. On second thought, this movie stinks. Don't even bother."

","After I had watched ""The Prestige"" in recent times, finally I had a chance to watch The ""Illusionist"". But I am now disappointed after seeing it because of recommendations of my friends. At that point, Christopher Nolan's difference appears. I think most of you, who watch The Illusionist after The Prestige, share the same feelings with me because there is no creativity, or kind of tricks or any other things which could put it into the top list. A simple story starts and continues during the whole film.<br/><br/>According to story, Illusionist Eisenheim falls in love with Duchess of Teschen in the childhood. After that they have to leave each other and after years they come together by chance in his theatre. Their plan based upon deceiving the inspector and public appears at the end of the film. To this plan, everyone is believed that Duchess is killed by the prince and Eisenheim calls the spirit of Duchess in his shows. Revenge of The Illusionist is very deep but he has to do that if he wants to regain her.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't find remarkable scenes to comment on them. It's not fluent and playing performance aren't so good."

","Okay. Let's start by discussing two of the performances which were superb - Rufus Sewell and Paul Giamatti. Both imbue their characters with a real depth that is very involving and intriguing. And the film looks sublime. The costumes are great. The range of male facial hair has been thoroughly stretched. But for heaven's sake - guys - what about about a story?! It was half-way through the film when a Considerablly Important Event occurs that I realised I did not give a monkeys about these people. Half the characters had been hinting since the beginning that it would happen anyway. The character with any sense of depth at all is the Crown Prince, and we're not supposed to like him. Everyone else (save Mr Giamatti's chief of police) drifts through in a dreamy haze, even Ed Norton, who does what he can but he hasn't been given much. he plays it a bit like he's a cult leader; a real life maker of magic rather than an illusionist with a smug grin. The Prestige was a flawed film and very silly but the focus was on the magic and the winning of the crowds which at least gave a sense of drama to proceedings. Here we're just expected to love Norton's character as the crowd do, no questions asked. Nah. He is just too flimsy and doesn't deserve it, thus making the 'twist' at the end worthless. A waste of everyone's time, especially mine!"

","After reading the negative reviews of this movie, I was compelled to write my first review. There are some very passionate people writing reviews on this website. It's surprising how extreme some of the reviews run from love to utter hate. I guess according to the negative reviewers, I'm stupid because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. It probably doesn't really deserve a 10 out of 10 because I know there are many excellent movies, but I was totally disgusted with the people who gave it a 1. I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but a 1? Obviously these people have no imagination. What's interesting is that if you look at these people's other reviews, they are mostly all negative. I'm surprised that some of these reviews were accepted, because they were out right nasty. Not only is the movie harshly criticized, but also anyone who likes it is called an idiot. There are plenty of movies that I've hated, but I don't see the point of bashing them and anyone who likes them.<br/><br/>I have a very broad interest in movies, but I think a lot of the new movies are real stinkers. The Illusionist is one of the exceptions. I'm not going into any details concerning this movie because I'm not exactly sure what constitutes a spoiler. I just think that the acting, photography and music were all excellent. Don't listen to the bashers. This movie is definitely worth a viewing. Hopefully I haven't made any serious grammatical or spelling errors. I get very annoyed with people who don't take the time to proof read what they write."

","This movie came out about the time ""The Prestige"" did. I really enjoyed that movie for its multiple plot levels. It also stayed a mystery to the end. I enjoyed both of them. I wish there were more films like these. This one sets you up by making it known that the purpose of the main character is to fool you. The film then sets about to do so, not with a bunch of gratuitous magic, but with a carefully plotted set of circumstances. You laugh, you cringe, you cry, you're outraged. The performance of Edward Norton is really admirable. He puts that neutral face on every event and yet you know he's teeming with emotion. His sense of love and craft are carefully integrated and we know the bad guy is going to pay in some way. One gets a little jaded sometime when films fail to deliver. Or the writer or director paint themselves into a corner. This doesn't happen here. There is something around every corner, but it doesn't jump out; it lies there unopened. You need to open it."

The movie had its good parts. But I couldn't stop thinking about The Prestige when I saw it. The Prestige is, according to me, so much better than The Illusionist, and although the movies really don't have that much in common, they're still much alike. And after watching The Prestige with its wicked end, it wasn't that hard to figure out how this film's ten last minutes would be like. <br/><br/>I give it 5/10, but that might not be a really fair grade.

"ExpendableMan","7","0","1","11 July 2007"," Don't mention The Prestige!
","If I might start with an incredibly clichéd opening line, you wait years for a movie about magicians (which doesn't include a lightning-scarred moppet as the central protagonist) then two come along at once. And just as Armageddon followed Deep Impact, Neil Burger's The Illusionist followed Christopher Nolan's The Prestige to the screens back in the summer of 2006. Now that both are available on DVD, it gives all of us amateur film critics that populate this website a chance to evaluate them on their own strengths but in truth, the only real similarity between the two is the presence of stage magic as a plot device. And while I must admit to having enjoyed Nolan's movie far more, The Illusionist is without a doubt the more sophisticated of the two.<br/><br/>While The Prestige relied on showmanship and a scantily clad Scarlett Johanson you see, The Illusionist relies on acting. To put it simply, there is not a single bad performance in the entire movie. Paul Giamatti for instance is fantastic, a dignified and mature performance who comes to be the on screen foil for all of us watching the movie; perplexed by the magic, he both desires and rejects its secrets, while at the same time wishing the damn magician would just do what he's told, yet rejoicing when he doesn't. Ed Norton meanwhile puts in another reliably magnificent turn as Eisenheim the Illusionist. Norton as should be common knowledge now is one of the finest actors of his generation and he inhabits every inch of his character. As such, Eisenheim is both a brilliant man and a lonely one, with a couple of odd quirks about him, the sort of person you'd go to watch in a theatre but wouldn't stick around to collect the autograph afterwards.<br/><br/>They are ably backed up by Rufus Sewell as the scheming Prince Regent of Vienna and Jessica Biel as his betrothed, secretly in love with Eisenheim. Sewell is so deliciously evil he could have walked out of a Sherlock Holmes novel, while Biel shakes off any sense of being a teen pin up icon and handles herself adeptly alongside all the 'proper' actors on screen. She also seems remarkably relieved to be in a film where she can be a little more feminine than usual and not have to worry about blowing things up all the time.<br/><br/>Excellent though the acting may be however, the underlying story sadly, isn't as effective as you might hope. The plot synopsis on this page sums it up nicely so I won't bother to reiterate the details, but it unfortunately turns into a rather straightforward revenge drama. Compared to the cat and mouse games of the Prestige, it follows a far more linear path and isn't anywhere near as tense, intriguing or exciting.<br/><br/>On the plus side however, the magic tricks are a natural high point, though I'm sure there will be plenty of you out there frustrated by the lack of explanation for all of them. So while we might get a glimpse at the document which explains how Eisenheim is able to grow an orange tree out of a pip in the space of a few minutes, a glimpse is all it is. Even so, this refusal to reveal the secrets perhaps gives The Illusionist a lot of its strength, for it imbues Eisenheim with an otherworldly and supernatural air. Is he really performing all these tricks for real? No, he can't be...Watch it with the lights switched off and a few candles burning and it'll be a delightfully unreal evening."

I love the twist at the end of this flick and no matter how hard I kept thinking trying to solve it, it still fooled me at the end. This movie can get a bit slow at times, the whole thing is basically the Illusionist performing miracle illusions and making him seem like a person who can contact the paranormal.

Jessica Biel doesn't have a very large part in the movie, which may have been a good choice on the part of the director (she's someone who probably should be seen and not heard), although her acting seems to have improved even a small amount. Aside from Edward Norton's silly little accent, the dialogue flowed very well, and the twist at the end was cool. I was expecting some sort of twist, but that was fantastic. I just got this huge, uncontrollable smile on my face once everything was revealed. The visuals especially were great, particularly in the scenes from Eisenheim's past.

","This film is magical and romantic in the best sense. Really well produced and acted, it is an interesting story of childhood sweethearts torn apart by class in turn of the century Vienna. <br/><br/>I'll be very frank, even though this is ""my kind of movie"" I did not see it in theatres because I did not want to pay top dollar to see another TV show/horror film American actress botch another film I would otherwise enjoy. Well, Jessica Biel does just fine as the romantic lead, Sophie. It is a rather limp leading lady role, but she acquits herself well in demeanor, sense of the time period, refinement, and the slight Viennese accent which really helps unify and solidify the entire cast. Move over Kirsten Dunst, here is a young actress who can actually handle period films. Meow.<br/><br/>Of course, Biel is surrounded by strong actors in much stronger roles, gorgeously moody Rufus Sewel, marvelously cast Paul Giamatti, and the versatile and here really soulful Edward Norton. He has really hit his mark here as a wounded romantic.<br/><br/>The magic remains magical in this film, with a supernatural feel that permeates the whole film. The melodrama of the plot is redeemed by the artistry of Norton, a really solid script that includes Sherlock Holmes type elements (Giamatti), the subtle evilness of Sewell's character, and the truly creepy actual historical locations. The theatre scenes feel like real, dusty Victorian theatres. (Contrasted with THE PRESTIGE, which I saw at the same time, which is just a bit more glossy, and not really magical at all, but a good thriller.)<br/><br/>As moody as a bank of fog, this is a top notch romantic date movie plus some."
"dbrown-13","6","0","2","20 March 2007"," I liked this movie, and yet I didn't
","Odd, but I did have mixed feelings after I watched this movie!<br/><br/>Technically the movie is perfection! The set-pieces and costumes are excellent. The lighting is used very effectively and the usage of older camera techniques such as the camera eye fade really do set the scene superbly. You almost believe you are watching 19th century Vienna, it's that good!<br/><br/>The acting too is excellent. I have always been a fan of Edward Norton, his performance as Eienheim the Illusionist here is very enigmatic and engaging. I have heard gripes about his accent but I could't see a problem. Rufus Sewell and Paul Giamati are also outstanding in their supporting roles. Sewell's Crown Prince exudes menace and authority in the right proportions while Giamati's police inspector struggles to balance his respect and admiration for Eisenheim (which he conveys flawlessly) with his allegiance to the Crown Prince and his wishes.<br/><br/>**Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is the plot, mainly in terms of the final 'twist'. In essence a 'twist' only really works when you don't see it coming, sadly this is not the case here. The movie gave away far too many hints too early to make the twist effective, particularly early dialogue between Eisenheim and Sophie. I won't go into specifics, suffice to say that I almost didn't expect the twist coming because that seemed too obvious. So I suppose you could say the twist worked as a double bluff!<br/><br/>Another problem I had with this movie were the illusions or 'tricks' Eisenheim performed. Throughout the film we are treated to several examples of these, and with few exceptions the illusions are so wondrous that had you seen someone perform these for real they would appear truly 'magical'. So, of course, in the end when the film attempts to explain the 'Orange Tree' illusion as purely mechanical fakery, this just doesn't seem feasible, it looks too real, too perfect! The same goes for all of Eisenheim's illusions, it is simply not believable that they were performed to the standards we saw with the technology available in the late 19th century.<br/><br/>So, in summary, overall I enjoyed the movie because it was executed so well, but the key plot points could have done with a little more thought to make them effective. 6/10"

","I had been looking forward to seeing this film as I am an Ed Norton fan and thought the story sounded very intriguing. The Illusionist tells the story of a magician whose powers verge on the supernatural and his love for a woman destined to marry the cruel and corrupt Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). He tries to use his 'magic' to save her from this fate.<br/><br/>The plot itself is fairly simple, most of which is at least hinted at in the trailer. One disappointing part was the transparency of certain 'plot twists' which were so glaringly obvious I was convinced they couldn't happen, but they did. A lot of criticism has been levelled at the film for the ambiguity of whether Eisenheim was purely an illusionist or actually performed magic. I think this is slightly unfair as explaining the tricks performed would take away some of the films mystery, but ultimately I think the film concludes he was the former.<br/><br/>Norton is on form as always and the acting is good all round. There are no standout performances but no let downs either.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is quite slow, gradually introducing you to Eisenheim's character before commencing with the story being told. Visually the film is very good, the way it is shot suits the setting very well.<br/><br/>I found the ending a little hard to swallow - bit too happy ever after for my liking, think it would have been much more suitable to have a dark ending.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fairly entertaining film which is let down by the obvious plot twists, twee ending and slightly slow pace.

Every actor is impeccable in their roles, every scene is perfectly measured out and paced for the right impact. It's theatrical acting at its best, amplified by the power of talented camera work and music score.<br/><br/>That said, the beginning of the movie - where the characters are shown in their teen years - is a bit weak. Plot-wise, it fits in well (just as the ""aha moment"" of the inspector Uhl at the end is a perfect resolution to the detective part of the movie), but the young actors don't nearly measure up to the rest of the cast. However, as soon as Norton appears on the stage, he is bound to steal the show. Amazingly, though, every character is just as perfectly cast as Norton's soft-spoken, iron-fist-in-the-velvet-glove artist; the lines go smoothly from one actor to another in a perfect logical progression. <br/><br/>Hands down, the best movie of the year."

Some of us believe we know what reality is, we've got it all figured out. The purpose of a brilliant story such as ""The Illusionist"" is to move us towards wonder. I am charmed by its ambiguities, I am thrilled by its transcendent nature. I wish I could write that well. The acting is superb. The music by Philip Glass: mood-perfect.

","The Illusionist is a very captivating movie, a little bit moody and dark at times, containing many twists and turns which keeps you guessing to the very end. There are some beautiful scenes, entertaining special effects, and some interesting cinematography during flashback episodes. This movie is very loosely based on a true story about the Austrian Habsburg royal family, when in 1889 Archduke Rudolf and his mistress Mary Vetsera committed suicide. There were strong performances by Edward Norton, who plays the very austere and mysterious illusionist Eisenheimer, and by Jessica Biel who plays the pouty and beautiful Duchess Sophie. Even though it is a love story  boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl again years later and must fight to have her - I did not find as much chemistry or passion between the two as I would have liked. The villain in the movie, Prince Leopold played convincingly by Rufus Sewell, was easy to dislike with his big ego and selfish manners, matching his wits against Eisenheimer as they fight over Sophie. This movie has one critical and nagging flaw  there was absolutely not a single shot of the city of Vienna, instead they decided to film in Prague and keep calling it Vienna. It would be like watching Sleepless in Seattle and having it filmed in San Francisco. I have been to both European cities, and some streets in Prague do resemble Vienna because they share similar Baroque architecture. But to not film at the sprawling Hofburg palace complex in downtown Vienna or the famous stately Schoenbrunn Palace is a crying shame. There were certainly a lot more illusions than I had bargained for in this movie."

","I thought this movie was great from beginning to end and pretty much the whole movie is an illusion itself. This is the true irony of the movie. My only problem with the movie is that a lot of the tricks are not believable even though Edward Norton's character boasts that they are illusions. There's no way in that time era a hologram could be created. Even the Orange Tree trick is not believable. Inside the Orange Tree book you can see diagrams of the trick and how the leaves are extracting out, but what about the oranges? Overall though the acting is great. Jessica Biel looks very amazing. Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors and Paul Giamatti is great as well. Both these actors should have won Oscars for famous roles in American History X (Norton) and Cinderella Man (Giamatti), but obviously the Acadamy Awards are the most biased awards in the history of mankind when horrible movies like Shakespare in Love are beating out movies like Saving Private Ryan (one of the best war movies ever) for Best Picture of the Year award.

","How bizarre, that two films centered on the mystery of magic and the timelessness of love situated in similar eras with a love triangle at the centre, would come out in the same year. Both films starring talented casts, no less. I speak of The Prestige and this film, The Illusionist.<br/><br/>For as much as The Prestige was as puzzling a film as this one, both are relatively easy to figure out with a keen view and knowledge of film or storytelling. Perhaps this is where the similarities must end, and comparisons no longer be drawn, because as I see it, The Illusionist is centered around a pure love story, Romeo and Juliet style, where no force can keep the loves separated. By contrast, The Prestige is about the relationship between two men who just can't seem to quit each other (not in the Brokeback Mountain sense) or let bygones be bygones, letting their professional quarrels spill over into their personal lives.<br/><br/>So, if inseparable love and undying passion is your cup of tea, then The Illusionist will fill your cup. Norton and Biel play their emotions beautifully, and Giamatti and Sewell continue their quest to be considered the best supporting actors in Hollywood. It's no secret that this film enjoys the better cast. Yet it keeps its secrets, unlike the foretelling found in the aforementioned film of similar theme and setting.<br/><br/>Norton really carries this piece, adding another top notch performance to his amazing resume. He comes across as vulnerable, yet powerful, a necessary trait for a star crossed lover facing opposition from the authorities and upper class. The movie's time and setting allow the film to draw out its key conflict, as Sewell and Giamatti must engage in a civil, cordial cat and mouse game with Norton, so as not to embarrass or misrepresent themselves. I can't imagine this same conflict in modern times, as a good pistol whipping or other gun play would solve this film in a quarter of an hour.<br/><br/>The Illusionist is not full of tricks, twists and shocking surprises. Instead, it mesmerizes you with sharp wit, sweet thoughts and stunning visuals that situate love where it belongs: out of this world.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","Although I did not see The Prestige yet, I think this is a well-made and good written film. It evokes passion, forbidden love between different social classes and it has an exquisite way of entertaining story telling. The performance of the main characters: Norton and Paul Giamati are so real that it felt they aren't acting, they are PERFORMING AS IF WERE REAL LIFE!!! The dialogs are clever between this two characters, though somehow seems a bit cheesy when it comes to Jessica Biel's character. The twists and the ending are well executed,that you'll be wanting more!!! If you are a fan of this genre, you'll find a nice piece of entertainment well done in this film."

","This is truly one the better films I've seen this year. Both Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti gave very solid performances. Norton gives an excellent performance as Eisenhiem an extremely talented & mysterious magician who mesmerizes everyone (including you) with his talents. Paul Giamatti nearly perfectly plays a police inspector who is torn between his admiration of Eisenhiem & his need to please the prince to promote himself socially. With these 2 performances must say that I expected as much from Norton, but Giamatti really surprised me with his performance in this role. Normally I tend to dislike ""period"" movies set back in whatever time period rarely seems to interest me. This one not only kept my interest, but demanded it. This is one of those movies that everything seems to come together just right to make a very entertaining movie that stands as one of 2006's best movies. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then see it! It's definitely worth the price of a rental. I've given this movie a 9 out of 10"

"TxMike","Null","0","1","16 January 2007"," Eisenheim, the illusionist, sets out to get the girl.
","I enjoyed this movie a lot, from beginning to end. It has some of the best actors working today, and an intriguing story. However, it is a good movie, not great. Strip away the illusions performed by Eisenheim and the story itself isn't particularly novel. Boy (Norton) from a lower class and girl(Biel) from a higher class want each other, but the social customs won't allow it. Throw in a budding ruler (Sewell) obsessed with power and his puppet constable (Giamatti), and you have the four characters and enough ingredients for a romantic drama.<br/><br/>Set in 1900 Vienna, Edward Norton is Eisenheim (a stage name) the illusionist, an extremely good illusionist. But 15 years earlier as an adolescent he became friends with young Sophie (Jessica Biel), who was taken away. They met again, during an Eisenheim performance, when she was the property of the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) who planned to marry her, and to become King, even if his father were not to die soon.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti has played a number of goofy roles, but here he is a totally different character, Inspector Uhl, who was a virtual puppet. When the Crown Prince took offense at an Eisenheim demonstration, he later told the Inspector, ""Shut him down."" So, much of the movie involves the Inspector and his men spying on Eisenheim and Sophie, and Eisenheim's attempts at freeing Sophie from the grips of the Crown Prince to allow the two of them to make a life together, the one that was denied them years earlier. What chance does one have, competing against a great illusionist? <br/><br/>SPOILERS. After an argument, it appears that the Crown Prince stabs Sophie, who rides away on a horse and is later found, apparently dead, in a stream. Later, illusions appear to bring Sophie back from the dead and, as they are about to arrest Eisenheim on stage, he is also just an illusion. Meanwhile, caught in a power scandal, the Crown Prince kills himself, Eisenheim gets away, Sophie is indeed alive. A brief set of quick flashbacks show the various deceptions, only the inspector has a hint of what really happened."
"camelot2302","9","0","1","16 January 2007"," What in the movie is real & what's an illusion?
","This movie actually surprised me. I'm no big fan of Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti is the kind of actor who impresses you in one movie and disappoints you in another. I have barely heard of Jessica Biel so when I heard the line-up, I was hardly jumping up saying ""YES! let's go and watch this!"". But after finally watching it, I am forced to admit that this time I was badly wrong because I enjoyed every minute.<br/><br/>Norton plays Eisenheim, a magician and illusionist who is able to perform magical illusions which no-one can explain. He is dismissed by some as a fraudster and a charlatan (especially by the Austro-Hungarian Crown Prince whom Eisenheim humiliated in public) but in general, the public love him and his shows and they are all sell-outs. It's this humiliation which I referred to that causes the Crown-Prince to order the police (a chief inspector played by Giamatti) to shut down Eisenheim's act and drive him out of town. But Eisenheim has no intention of leaving because the Crown Prince's fiancée is actually a childhood sweetheart of Eisenheim and the Illusionist is determined not to lose her a second time.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the Crown Prince doesn't take kindly to a charlatan and a trickster moving in on his girl and so he sets out to bring down Eisenheim by trying to discredit the illusion acts. You can guess already that Eisenheim is two steps ahead of the Crown Prince and a plot is hatched so he and his sweetheart can finally run away together. <br/><br/>A sub-plot has the Crown Prince plotting to overthrow his father, the Emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire so Princy Boy can take over. This is obviously high treason and Mr Prince decides that the Illusionist is a threat to his cunning dastardly plans.<br/><br/>The acting was really good and the script is great. I highly recommend this movie to anybody interested in this type of story."

I couldn't believe at the end that what I thought had happened hadn't. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys sitting down and just enjoying a good movie. I don't recommend it to those that are looking for a film that mirrors reality in any way. I fell completely in love with the main characters and truly despised the villains. I was kept in true suspense during the entire film. The special effects were done very well and the scenery was at times breathtaking. This film will definitely bring a tear to your ladies eye as she sighs, looks you in the eye and says ""would you do that for me?""."
"Scarecrow-88","8","0","1","15 January 2007"," The Illusionist
","I'm not sure I buy the end result(an illusionary twist which depends on an awful lot of coincidence), but it's a lot of fun getting there. Visually dazzling and well executed drama about an illusionist named Eisenheim(Edward Norton who is quite spellbinding in a very mysterious role)who ruffles the feathers of Crown Prince Leopold(Rufus Sewell at his nasty, slimy best;he's just so menacing in these juicy roles as hot-tempered aristocrats who will not be made fool of in crowds as long as he has power)with a trick(a humdinger of irony;it's an Excaliber trick which really pokes fun at Leopold). Torn away from his beloved Sophie(he a son of a peasant cabinet-maker, she a duchess), Eisenheim once again meets her on stage only to find out she's possibly to marry Leopold. But, that flame burns as bright as ever, and Leopold uses his patsy of a police inspector, Uhl(Paul Giamatti, who is very, very good)to find dirt on Eisenheim to shut his illusion act down. Imagine the fury inside Leopold when he finds out from Uhl that Sophie and Eisenheim may be plotting a getaway. Leopold is not a man to be trifled with, and Sophie is a major factor for him to gain favor with the Hungarians. When Sophie informs Leopold that it is Eisenheim she wants, it appears that he may've stabbed her with his withdrawn sword. Her body is found with a gaping wound which seems to show signs of being stabbed through the neck..gems from a certain sword may prove Leopold's guilt.<br/><br/>This throws Eisenheim's life in a whole new direction as he finds an old theater and begins performing what appear to be resurrections of ghosts which shock and awe audience-goers. Uhl begins to notice a following and Leopold himself even attends a show under guise when Eisenheim shocks everyone in attendance by ""resurrecting Sophie's ghost""! Leopold is certainly enraged now and wants Eisenheim stopped at all costs because there are now vocal Vienna folk claiming the Prince as being a murderer(his past murder of another girl he pushed off a balcony doesn't help his case any).<br/><br/>The ending is a doozy(the final illusion on stage and a little twist that occurs once we see Leopold's fate)and really had my jaw dropped to the floor in amazement. The film offers many cool illusions performed on stage by Eisenheim, but it's also Norton's mysterious performer who holds you at a distance wondering just how truly gifted he really is. That mystery he has is vital to the strength of the film I believe. We don't need to see how he does the tricks he accomplishes because just wondering what kind of powers he really has a hold on not just the audience watching him perform..but us as well."

","I very much enjoyed this movie - especially Giamotti and Norton who both kept the interest level very well. They're 2 of the more likable and talented actors around, and the movie met and slightly exceeded my expectations - although I knew nothing of the story beforehand. I liked the plot and storyline even though the mystery was plainly given-way to the audience. Overall it was a good romance masquerading as a mystery. Biel did a decent job - satisfactorily. The costumes, settings, and backdrops were great, and the dialogue plausible and smoothly enduring of another time period while not trying to be too out-of-date. The movie runs a brisk runtime and seamlessly tells a story in a non-linear fashion. I most enjoyed the Giamotti character who had the most development (SPOILER) - and in the end has us sharing in his delight. Yes the ending although maybe not surprising is still quite enjoyable."
"xredgarnetx","6","0","1","7 January 2007"," OK period piece
","Like THE VILLAGE, THE ILLUSIONIST is a romance and not a thriller. Unfortunately, like THE VILLAGE, THE ILLUSIONIST was advertised as a thriller. Edward Norton plays a German woodworker's son in the late 19th century who falls for a beauty of aristocratic birth, portrayed by small screen actress Jessica Beale. They are forced apart but run into each other again years later, when Norton has returned to town as a prestidigitator known as Eisenheim. The remainder of the movie details their attempts to help her escape the clutches of a nefarious prince, played by Rufus ""Dark City"" Sewell, who senses in Eisenheim a threat to his rule. It is a classic plot, one that has been employed since the days of the Greek Empire. Paul Giamatti plays the stern but secretly compassionate chief inspector of the city. Surprisingly, Eisenheim's magic tricks are subdued and subtle, and the CGI is used sparingly, at least until the big finale. The costuming and sets are first-rate, and the unusual cinematography creates a definite mood. Unfortunately, the twist ending is telegraphed early on, and once more I want to warn you this is a romance, not a thriller. THE ILLUSIONIST plods along a bit, especially after misfortune besets the lovers, and Norton underplays his role to the point of being almost absent. Beale is a natural beauty, but unfortunately not much of an actress. See THE ILLUSIONIST for Sewell, a much undervalued actor, and the jovial Giamatti, who gets the last laugh. Also, the legendary Philip Glass wrote the haunting score."

Edward Norton plays the magician and Jessica Biel plays his love interest. Paul Giamatti plays the chief of police and like he usually likes to do kinda steals the movie from Biel and Norton. The story is about Norton but the true narrative is Giamatti's.

","Edward Norton sometimes makes mistakes (such as in Red Dragon). But, when he does choose right, does it with intelligence and criterion unmatched by the actors of his generation. In The Illusionist, he plays the magician Eisenheim, that haunts the Viena of 1900 with his poetical and mysterious tricks - which awakes not only the diffidence of the prince heir (Rufus Sewell) but also the passion of his probable promised (Jessica Biel) with whom Eisenheim had a romantic past. Norton opposes his rational performance to the more expansive style of Paul Giammati, as the police officer whose curiosity is like an itch. The result is a movie extremely well resolved, with a preoccupation that, maybe because of bad luck, has been off the current fashion these days: to tell a story right."
"stuart-502","9","0","1","9 December 2006"," The Illusionist is definitely one to see.
","I give The Illusionist a 9/10 only because to give it that extra point would be to debase the scoring system. I saw a good deal of this really excellent movie in a sadly cropped version as the in-flight movie between Paris and Istanbul. For various reasons we didn't see it all. To my delight The Illusionist was the in-flight movie on yesterday's return flight Istanbul - Paris. The only problem being that no headphones had been provided on the flight.<br/><br/>OK, being in the business I saw quite enough of it to judge its excellence and urgently want to see the whole movie, as for me it's likely to be a very useful period lighting reference. It was shot in Prague and the flavor of 1890 - 1905 Austro-Hungarian Empire Europe flows. This movie is a beauty in so many ways, Acting, Direction, casting, sets, lighting, FX, romance; one could go on. It seems that Edward Norton learned to perform some of the illusions himself which makes it even better. Definitely one to see."

I think that's part of the fun. Most people didn't like The Village because they felt like they were being lied to. At least that was the biggest complaint that I heard. People like movies similar to The Truman Show, because they already knew ""the secret"". People just don't want to feel like ""the Villagers or Truman""! M. Night Shyamalan should have directed this! Then that would have pi$$ed off more viewers. How can a movie go wrong with Ed Norton and Rufus Sewell?? It just can't. Most viewers probably hated this because Jessica Biel was not naked.

"jluis1984","8","0","1","18 October 2006"," Very well done film
","After a very modest debut in 2002 with ""Interview with the Assassin"", director Neil Burger practically came out of nowhere with this impressive period piece that blends subtly the artistic vision of an ""arthouse"" film with the commercial appeal of a summer blockbuster. ""The Ilusionist"" is a remarkably well-done tale of drama and romance with a touch of fantasy, that while probably not entirely original or historically accurate, surely not only brings back the joy of watching a period piece, but the overall pleasure of watching movies as a whole. This may sound exaggerated (and probably it is), but in a year lacking good surprises, this is a film that really stands out among the rest. Not an easy feat for a modest independent film.<br/><br/>Based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, ""The Ilusionist"" is the tale of two different, but very similar persons. Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is in charge of arresting Eisenheim (Edward Norton), the famous illusionist that has shocked Vienna with his extraordinary talent and nearly impossible tricks. Something has done Eisenheim that has forced the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) to order his arrest and Uhl must now do the deed. However, soon Uhl discovers that the secrets of Eisenheim the Ilusionist are related to Sophie (Jessica Biel), Prince Leopold's fiancée.<br/><br/>Adapted to the screen by Burger himself, ""The Ilusionist"" is a tale appropriately surrounded by illusions. As Uhl's character tries to uncover the nature of Eisenheim's powers, we get deeper and deeper inside the illusion crafted by the writers. While the story could had easily being about the confrontation between the illusionist and the detective, it opts for the romance angle, a move that while sacrifices a great deal of originality, is well-developed and probably suits the overall tone and mood Burger crafts with his romanticizes version of the turn of the century Vienna. The story in turn comprises both Uhl's investigation as well as the tale of the forbidden love between Eisenheim and Sophie, keeping a nice balance between both and a good deal of mystery that makes the final conclusion a great spectacle.<br/><br/>Visually the film is extremely good for the budget Burger had, considering its not an easy task to recreate a period piece. A highlight of the film, is the beautiful cinematography (by Dick Pope) that evokes the early silent films in a way that fits the movie perfectly. Philip Glass' score is very good, although at times feels a bit too modern (like out of place), giving an odd sensation. Still, the film works remarkably well thanks to Burger's precise direction that give life to Millhauser's story with a captivating artistic vision.<br/><br/>Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are both excellent in their roles, being another of the strong points of the film. Norton delivers a classy performance that once again shows off that his talent is still there and only needs the right direction. Giamatti delivers the best acting in the movie, as Chief Inspector Uhl, he becomes our eyes and takes us through Eisenheim's illusions in a very real, albeit subtle performance. Jessica Biel is probably the weakest link in the cast, as while she looks the part, shows almost no chemistry with Norton, as if she was uncomfortable. The surprise comes from Rufus Sewell, who is both frightening and charming as Crown Prince Leopold in a way that it's a joy to hate him.<br/><br/>""The Ilusionist"" is a terrific film considering Burger's little experience, but it has some small problems that are impossible to not notice. First of all, it's probably quite predictable, due to its unoriginal love story. However, this by no means makes it a boring film, as Burger's storytelling makes the same old story look new and fresh again, making up for its unoriginal tale. The CGI used in the film is a bit excessive and noticeable, but again, nothing that would spoil the entertainment it provides. Finally, as written above, I thought that Biel's performance is clearly overshadowed by her cast-mates, who deliver a wonderful job making Biel look a bit out of place.<br/><br/>Despite those troubles, ""The Ilusionist"" succeeds in delivering a captivating story that never becomes boring or tiresome. Without the budget of a blockbuster, Burger creates one of the best films of the year, without compromising his vision and with very good results. He certainly shows promise, let's hope his talent is not another illusion. 8/10"

Honestly couldn't tell if it was the poor Cinemark projection system in our brand new theater, or whether the film was intended to have many ""soft spots"" (focus), and soft edges (again, focus). Paul Giamatti (Stern's ""Pig Vomit"") did an outstanding job with the film. Very talented actor! Worth the money to see the film, but was a little disappointed in the ""culmination"" (you'll understand if you see it). Weakness, to me, was in the lack of sense that there was any strong love interest (probably on the editing room floor to cut the time down). Also, (without giving anything away), the end rushed and where there was to be a ""gee whiz"", it was more like a ""who got tired of writing, watched The Sixth Sense, and thought 'hey, people will really get a kick out of this'"".

I do have to give him credit though, it's been awhile since he's been on screen and also for doing this sort of romance type of movie.

","Much of a film's interest starts the moment audiences see trailers for it , and such was the case with THE ILLUSIONIST. The dark themes, nice sets, pretty actors/actresses, and supernatural undertones probably drew movie-goers to the theaters after checking out the trailers. But some may be disappointed to find little else behind The Illusionist. Although this disappointment won't fall to the level of despair or hatred of the film, movie buffs may feel as if they were lied to when it doesn't deliver the high-caliber flick they were expecting.<br/><br/>The story  Eisenheim the Illusionist is played by Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X), and Norton does an okay job with a scripted character that seems to have few emotions. Eisenheim's life has focused on his magical craft since he left his hometown and the love of his life, Sophie (Jessica Biel, ELIZABETHTOWN), a fellow teenager who's way above Eisenheim's station. Fifteen years later we find Eisenheim in Vienna only to discover that Sophie, now a beautiful young baroness, slated to marry into the upper echelon of royalty. Her husband-to-be is the dangerous and manipulating Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, DARK CITY). But when Eisenheim and Sophie try to rekindle their love interest, deadly forces are at play and are ready to rip them apart again. One of these forces is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti, Cinderella MAN), the upstart of a poor butcher who's trying to rise to a power all his own (Viennese Mayor Uhl? Nice ring to it, eh?).<br/><br/>Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan in which she can detach herself from the Crown Prince, but the plan seems doomed from the start. Sophie's life is put in danger and Eisenheim has to use his incredible illusionist powers to help save their lives and their love. But can it work? As with the title and the main character, much of what is seen is complete illusion. But if one watches carefully, they can pick up on hints of what is truly going on. ""Make us disappear,"" Sophie pleads with Eisenheim at the beginning of the film as they cower in a hut. And that he cannot do so obviously affects the rest of his life and the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The shinning stars in The Illusionist are Giamatti, Sewell, and, surprisingly, Biel. Although the entire focus of the film is around Norton's character, it's tough to get ""into"" him when what he mostly does is sit on a stage and make soulful apparitions appear by looking as if he were having a particularly tough bowel movement.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti really steals the show here. How great it is to see someone of Giamatti's chops FINALLY get the recognition he deserves and star in some great roles. Now he's proving that he's not just a co-star (THE TRUMAN SHOW, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). His Inspector Uhl character is miles away from well Miles in his career launching SIDEWAYS film. That the audience both roots for Uhl and hopes he fails is evidence of Giamatti's great acting ability.<br/><br/>Rufus Sewell is the bad guy everyone loves to hate. He's done it time and again (A KNIGHT'S TALE, HELEN OF TROY, etc.) and pulls in a wonderfully slimy character portrayal here, too.<br/><br/>But Jessica Biel is the biggest surprise. Looking both pretty and elegant, Biel goes further than she's ever gone before  far beyond 7th HEAVEN and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE  and may have cemented herself as an actress with Oscar-caliber potential.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown for film-o-philes will be that The Illusionist doesn't expand much beyond what they saw in the film's trailers a few months ago. But it does entertain, and it's visually interesting and well shot. Just don't expect too much from the script and you'll probably be just fine."

You're talking to a chick, so you think, you're chatting it up and doing great and floating on air...than the house lights come up. No. Cover your eyes, she's not so hot, not even a woman! A good movie starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel and Rufus Sewell in a story about a magician that challenges the Prince of Austria for the love of a woman. Norton plays a celebrated illusionist Eisenheim, who's in love with a Duchess, Jessica Biel, but she's about to wed the prince, Rufus Sewell. The two lovers plan to deceive everyone and run off forever.<br/><br/>The first half sets everything up and the second half shows us the con of the prince unfolding before us. If you like magic, than this is the film for you...well, for the first half of the film. Norton starts conjuring up ghosts and the city of Vienna rallies behind him because they think he's a spiritual leader. All the while, Sewell wants him shut down because the people like him.<br/><br/>Two things I have against this film. Eisenheim seems to be such a good magician/illusionist that he doesn't fail at all...ever. The movie becomes a showcase of Eisenheim's skills and we're left with watching him pull off this con of making his love, the Duchess, disappear. Which you figure out if you had a half of a brain. Which brings me back to why I compare this to the last the minutes at the bar. You think it's great but once you start thinking back and breaking it down, the movie doesn't look good under the house lights...too much smoke and mirrors for me.<br/><br/>A good film if you like period pieces, magic, mystery, strong performances by Ed Norton and Paul Giamatti and a good con. Better than most.<br/><br/>3 stars Cave Man Reviews"

","This interesting, well acted, beautiful with-a-twist feast was surprising. Surprising too was the number of times the modern mikes would drop into the scene from out of the sky. From mid-way through the film through the remainder of the film, we had several (too many to count) scenes with Mr. Mike. First it was fuzzy mike and then it was striped mike and then it was black mike. Our movie audience went from giggling at Mr. Mike, laughing at it and then exasperated with it. How come no one has mentioned the stupidity of the mike being in these scenes? How could they release this film? Not because the story - which was very engaging - but because they released it without editing out the idiotic extra character. Gosh, I can't tell you how much of the film's dialog I missed because of the dumb and dumber mikes!"

But never mind that! To say that I was enchanted from the first 15 minutes is an understatement; An intelligent, thought provoking film with excellent acting on everyone's part; A fast moving, connected, script with an actual cohesive, surprisingly, original plot! Can't say too much more without giving it away, but there are many twists and ""illusions"" that somehow brought out the ""inner child""; Very gratifying; hope it wins some ""Best"" something awards at the Oscars!"

","It's really a pity that a movie with an interesting script twist, so rare in Hollywood, strong actors, beautiful costumes and landscapes is acted in such a disastrous way. Only Giamatti is above reproach, and Sewell does his part well, even though it's only 'black hat through-and-through'. Norton for some reason never even tries, maybe, cannot figure out what is it exactly that he's doing. The biggest problem are extras - somehow they all manage to speak in unnatural voices - as if they try very hard to emulate Austrians, but have no clue what those strange creature are supposed to sound like. Also keeping costs low makes ""crowds"" in Vienna ridiculously small - it's hard to believe that this ""mob"" of 40 people will storm precincts.<br/><br/>Again, a real pity given a promising plot..."

","Writer-director Neil Burger's adaptation of a Steven Milhauser short story, ""The Illusionist"" transports us to late nineteenth century Vienna, Freud, feudal lords and ladies and phantasms, the spiritualists' promise of a personally intimate hereafter.<br/><br/>The setting is a flash-forward of fifteen years from the film's beginning in which we meet two teens, a young cabinet maker's son, set on his life's path after a chance meeting with an itinerant magician, and young Sophie, born to a much higher station. He presents Sophie with a hand-carved wooden locket containing a secret compartment into which he has put his photograph. Viennese society abhors the vacuum between their states; and so they are forcibly separated. We soon feel as if we're caught up in a fairy tale, made a bit uneasy by the proposition that these wizards and villains are real.<br/><br/>Having adopted the stage name of Manheim the Illusionist, the young man, now an adult, Edward Norton, is fast becoming the darling of Viennese society; and at one performance, he asks for a volunteer, in response to which Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell, offers his beautiful companion, Jessica Biel, who happens to be Sophie.<br/><br/>Leopold attends such entertainments as these not so much to be amused as to display how clever he himself is at unmasking the performers' gimmicks. He does not suffer frustration easily; and so vents his on Chief Police Inspector Uhl, Paul Giamatti, himself an amateur magician, always looking to learn more. Giamatti, son of a butcher, faces the same societal barriers and ceilings that the two youngsters encountered fifteen years earlier. The detective's career and political future are firmly tied to the level of approbation he receives from the nasty, vindictive Crown Prince. After a particularly embarrassing challenge,thwarted, Leopold insists that the Illusionist's stardom in Vienna must end. The volatile Leopold also announces his intention to marry Sophie. One is left to imagine his reaction at Sophie's rejection.<br/><br/>After a time, Mannheim buys an old abandoned theater and makes a comeback, presenting a new type of illusion. No more sprouting orange plants or handky-bearing butterflies, Mannheim now conjures spirit emanations from the other side, astonishing and giving renewed hope to audiences in search of their own immortality. Can such trickery bring down a monarchy or threaten the succession?<br/><br/>Edward Norton is both steely and vulnerable as the title character. Giamatti portrays Uhl, at once pressured, avidly inquisitive, deeply knowing and positively manic for things well done. Jessica Biel brings a vulnerable yet fiery Sophie into the plot. Rufus Sewell is both seething, condescending elitist and emotionally tortured perfectionist with no tolerance for disappointment, especially in himself. We get the feeling that the prospect of the throne, for all his display, weighs heavily on his shoulders.<br/><br/>The absolute stars of the film are cinematographer Dick Pope and the magnificent settings provided by Petra Habova and Ondrej Nekrasil. If one listens carefully to the Philip Glass score, there are recurrent echoes of Glass' 1983 themes of ""Koyaaniqatsi.""<br/><br/>One is reminded of the title. In this context lies the single flaw in the production. Yes, while photo imagery was a practiced art by the turn of the century, as were the wonders of smoke and mirrors, there does come a point where the envelope is pushed just too far; and at this point, the ability of the audience to suspend disbelief is diminished."

","This is the type of movie I would like to have the leisure to watch at home as a rental - or an evening movie presentation on TV. Maybe I'm spoiled by cerebral twists at the theatre, but this movie was promising to be tantalizing but ultimately failed to deliver the expected punch. The character (Sophie), played by Biels, was two-dimensional at best. I was left puzzled as to why Norton's character - the Illusionist - found her so unforgettable - I certainly did. One kind of hopes that someone with his supposed depth would be mystified by someone with some zip or zap - not sip and sap. Sophie is an aristrocrat who the young illusionist befriends as a youth - and we're led to believe that puppy love blossomed between the two children until the young cabinet maker's lad (who later grows up to be the Illusionist) is sent away and the friendship is broken due to social class systems. Time quickly progresses and we see Norton again as a very talented magician. What follows is a rather hard to swallow plot - even for an illusion. Maybe I've grown cynical and need more to go on than baby love between two characters that have yet to convince me that I am rooting for their togetherness."

"cultfilmfan","8","0","1","2 September 2006"," The Illusionist
","The Illusionist is based on the short story Eisenheim The Illusionist by Steven Millhauser. The film is set in the late 1800's and is about a magician named Eisenheim who does magic shows in theatres. As a child Eisenheim fell in love with a girl named Sophie, but her parents did not allow them to see each other anymore. Years later as adults now Eisenheim meets up with Sophie again and she is engaged to the crown prince named Leopold. Eisenheim hopes to use his illusions to get Sophie back to him. Also after a murder is committed in town Eisenheim helps to show Chief Inspector Uhl and the rest of the town who the killer is using his magic and illusions. The Illusionist has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good set decoration, good costumes and good makeup. The film is very good looking and everything is down to the very littlest detail making the film look like it takes place in the 1800's and the whole crew who made it look like that did a very good job. The story is very original and I liked the romance part of the movie, the mystery and even the scenes where Eisenheim is performing his illusions. The film at least for me was completely unpredictable and lots of surprises lay ahead for me and they were good surprises and added a lot to it. The film is well made in pretty much every way and the story had a good pace I thought and really drew me into the movie and it kept my interest very well without ever losing me. Even watching the scenes with the magic tricks were really neat to watch and just as the audience in the movie was amazed by the tricks I enjoyed watching them from where I sat as well. I again compliment the movie on it's very original story and a lot of imagination and creativity went into this script and it blends well with the different genres of the film. I was very pleased to see my local theatre get this film seeing as it is an independent film and as much as I liked it I would have to say the audience who I saw the film with really enjoyed it as well, so I applaud my local theatre for getting this film and I hope more people go see it. This film is award worthy in many different ways and at the end of the movie I was very satisfied by what I had seen. One of the best looking and more original films of the year and also one of the best."
"ikanboy","8","0","2","2 September 2006"," A deft period piece that draws you under it's spell.
","It is Vienna, circa late 1800's. A magician, known as Eisenheim is plying his trade to an enraptured audience. He is no ordinary magician, content to pull rabbits out of his hat, he offers illusions that appear real. One night the Crown Prince Leopold decides to attend with an entourage and his soon to be betrothed. When Eisenheim asks for a volunteer, Leopold offers her.<br/><br/>On stage we see that Eisenheim recognizes her as the girl he loved as a teen, and whose family separated them, because he was of the wrong class: Common. She does not recognize him until after the act is over. Leopold, played with great icy arrogance by Rufus Sewell - a younger look alike to Ian McShane - and probably most recognizable to American audiences as the bad Knight of ""Knight's tales"", invites Eisenheim to his palace for a private performance.<br/><br/>In the mean time, Eisenheim (Norton) meets secretly with his erstwhile love, and the flame is rekindled.<br/><br/>At the Palace Eisenheim finds that Leopold plans to have his ""illusions"" unmasked, so that he can bask in the public humiliation of a man whose talents he finds threatening, but instead Eisenheim makes the mistake of publicly humiliating Leopold and dooms his career.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is the Chief of Police, and in the pocket of Leopold, and is sent to discover Eisenheim as a fraud, and thus ruin him, but before he can do so Eisenheim's humiliation of Leopold does it anyway.<br/><br/>Eisenheim and his love plan to elope but tragedy intervenes and the movie takes on a darker tone. Eisenheim know seems to be on the path of vengeance, and in the process seems to have joined hands with the dead. He conjures up spirits and his fame returns even more strongly.<br/><br/>Leopold presses the police chief to do his bidding, and the movie rises to it's conclusion with a final trick of illusion.... or does it? Norton is wonderful in a tightly controlled role, and uses his mesmerizing gaze to great affect. He seems to fit into this role much better because he underplays it. Giamatti continues to amaze by ditching his trademark grin and smirk for a straight face. Sewell plays the villain to the hilt, and is probably going to be stuck in these kinds of roles unless he avoids the lure of Hollywood.<br/><br/>As a period piece the movie delivers a realistic and beautifully colored frame, that helps to enrapture the audience in the story, and even though the ending can be predicted by those looking for the ""sting,"" I was pleased to be caught unawares."

The Illusionist is no different.<br/><br/>I was worried a little going into this that he may have gotten a little out of practice from taking time off from acting ... but I am glad I was proved wrong. He gives a strong performance, and is very dignified in the way that he carries himself throughout the whole film. Giamatti did a great job too, and I was surprised that Biel pulled off the role the way she did.<br/><br/>My only negative thought about the movie is the way that it was filmed, which kind of made me worry at first ... but after I got used to it ...

"alex-finazzo","8","0","2","1 September 2006"," Audience gets played
","Form matters to the director of this film; every detail of cinematography, writing, and acting control the audience. Throughout the movie you must ask yourself, ""Is this real or an illusion?"" The movie is hard to bear in some parts. It's very thoughtful, but the plot drive suffers in a few key parts of the film. It is by no means a summer blockbuster, but an excellent film.<br/><br/>Giamatti's performance is outstanding. His acting is consistently excellent, and his ability to completely absorb himself into a part makes him really the only true character actor of our time. But equally impressive is the way that Norton's character is subtly revealed and his true mastery exposed bit by bit.<br/><br/>If you enjoy cerebral, deliberate films, this is a must see. If you prefer fast-paced or blockbuster films, don't waste your time--you will not appreciate it and judge it harshly."

","What a surprise I got from The Illusionist! When I saw the first trailer I wanted to see this movie. Then I heard various negative reviews that gave me the impression this may not be one I want to see. I am so glad I ignored those reviews.<br/><br/>I found The Illusionist to be magical.<br/><br/>This is a story of ""young love rekindled"" like no other I have seen before. While the young girl grows up to be a beautiful young lady who enjoys special privileges, she obviously is not happy. The boy grows up to be a young man with a special talent which amazes people where-ever he goes and threatens those who it have it all and think they deserve it.<br/><br/>Pity those who do not understand this power or the magical love planted in the hearts of young ones trapped in unforetold destiny.<br/><br/>Along with the usual attractions, The Illusionist accomplishes something few movies do - all the characters were extremely interesting. This was not about just one or two people. Everyone had a part and all the performers played their characters with love! I found myself actually paying attention to everyone in this movie just like we pay attention to a magician who is about to attempt tricking his audience.<br/><br/>You may have noticed I rated this a 7. There are problems and that's why I didn't rate it higher. The Illusionist needed a better score. while it was pleasing for the most part, it seemed out of synch during some important parts of the movie. I think narration was very good and probably should have replaced certain parts of the score. Along with the score one other flaw did not escape my attention - the fast paced ending. It is unfortunate these two flaws existed but still, the acting, narration, story and cinematography excelled."

","The illusionist is the first film I've seen in a while where I had no idea what it was really about. I have to say that I was not disappointed at all! The film has a good story that really draws you in with mystery and romance. The illusions done by Norton as Eisenheim the Illusionist are FANTASTIC! The give the film a novelty feel that you are watching both a magic show and a movie at the same time. Furthermore, I've seen that some people are worried that the film will give away some secrets of how the tricks are done, but don't worry, aside from one comical scene between Giamatti and Norton, most of illusions remain as such throughout the movie.<br/><br/>For the people who claim to be able to guess the ending, I agree with you, it is possible if you actively pay attention to whats going on instead of being drawn in by the overall story. However, I think that takes away from the fun of the movie, so unless you're the kind of person that must know how the trick is done instead of appreciating it for what it is, I would say, just sit back and enjoy the magic of The Illusionist."
"Astralan","9","0","2","28 August 2006"," A Pallet of magic and intrigue.
","An intriguing and beguiling movie, deep and rich with a Rembrandt like pallet for film texture, The Illusionist was another enjoyable summer surprise. The casting constellation well chosen, Paul Giamatti, Edward Norton and Jessica Biel led the average Joe Schmoe movie viewer through a wonderful maze where you fell into pits, hit dead ends and locked doors, and were willing to believe the more obvious but expect the suspect: A love story that piloted the events through a tangled web of preverifications between truth and deceit.<br/><br/>But it is magic.<br/><br/>The movie was well named. Edward Norton plays Eisenheim, who from childhood chance meetings with a magician becomes enamored with not just slight of hand, also falls in love with the beautiful Sophie (Jessica Biel). The relationship is doomed for the start. She is a duchess and he the son of a cabinet maker. It is, after all, an age old story, but this one draws you in because I believe everyone loves a magician... even if it is just to expose the tricks they perform. And then there is the Chief Inspector, Played extremely well by Paul Giamatti, who is given the task to filter out the visual illusions from the truth. Both Giamatti and Norton seem to get equal attention in the film, and it is refreshingly well paced. I did not feel it was too long or too short. The story just fit perfectly in the 110 minutes it used.<br/><br/>I would like to go back to the film texture. Like many sci-fi films that are shot like looking through collored lenses (like the Matrix and Underworld), this one chose sepia and higher contrasts to its presentation. Like so many masters that used the browns in an under-painting and then added color on top, the visual world is enhanced in a richness and warmth, yet enshrouded in a mystery of it's own. The film is totally wrapped in it own luster that you are coaxed in to the lives and thinkings of the primary characters.<br/><br/>It is magic.<br/><br/>And I'm spoiling the film no more. Go see it. It has more depth than you realize."

She was okay in the role,but she isn't nearly the caliber of performer as Edward Norton and Paul Giametti. If Nicole Kidman was younger she would have been good for the part or among younger actresses, Liv Tyler, who I believe played a princess in the ""Lord of the Rings"" (sorry, I didn't see any of the trilogy -- I guess I'm just not a ""ringer."")<br/><br/>And why when she (Jessica Biel/Dutchess Sophia) was young did she have fair hair and blue eyes, and as an adult,she had brown hair and dark eyes?

","Just came back from catching this film and, while I knew it would be good, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It wasn't so much the story that I responded to, but the performances. All around great acting. Of the three leads (Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Jessica Biel), Giamatti was, in my opinion, the standout. This role is a sort of variation on the kind of shlumpy, everyman types we usually see him playing. This time, his everyman is a Chief Inspector in turn-of-the-century Vienna. Giamatti looks the part, speaks with the requisite accent and completely pulls the part off. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. Norton is great as well, playing his character very subtly and not hogging his scenes. Biel, besides looking perfectly fetching in the period costumes, is also excellent as the ""love interest"" character. We've come a long way from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" haven't we, Jessica? Rufus Sewell also has some terrific moments as the Crown Prince.<br/><br/>Aside from the stellar acting, the film is quite an achievement in set design and attention to period detail. Watching the film is like watching a fine painting come to life: a true ""motion picture."" Director Neil Burger's picture is a beautiful, well-crafted mystery/love story that keeps the viewer interested and engaged. I understand that Mr. Burger tried to use a minimal amount of CGI effects and this, I think, was a smart move as the absence of major effects keeps the viewer's attention on the story and the performances.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that keeps you riveted until the ""twist ending"" which, I suppose, some people may see coming, but I didn't.

And yet most movies are not really very good because the script is usually not very good. They may be unbelievable or insipid, or you just get the feeling that the characters just cannot really act that way. However, in this case, we have the perfect combination of a really good and complex intelligent script combining with wonderful acting....Edward Norton plus the other three top actors, to produce a most enjoyable movie.

It seems to 'climax' about the middle of the movie, and you think ""Okay, what's next?"" Eisenheim continues to perform tricks, and is obviously working towards SOMETHING, and you keep thinking, ""This is going to be good"". Then, about 3/4 thru the movie, Police Chief Uhl comments that he KNOWS Eisenheim is tricking the public into believing all these illusions. Okay. So by the time the actual climax comes around, you're like ""Uh, we've already gone over that......haven't we?"" The director said it was from Uhl's point of view, yet Uhl figured it out early on in KNOWING that Eisenheim was 'tricking' his public.<br/><br/>But a BEAUTIFULLY-FILMED movie, the acting was superb, Paul Giamatti never ceases to amaze me with his acting range.

","I went into The Illusionist with high expectations and, though I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I wasn't completely satisfied. The simple story of a magician in turn-of-the century Vienna who encures the wrath of the Crown Prince by stealing the affections of his fiancÃ© is a promising one and manages to delight even while its somewhat predictable. The magic tricks in the film are fun to watch even though a good chunk of movie magic had to have been involved. The story and the tricks set up location (filmed in Prague) that is fascinating. The film was filled with solid performances: Edward Norton chalks up another quality outing (though he seems somehow out of place at points), Jessica Biel is lovely but doesn't have much to do and no one plays charming villains better than Rufus Sewell I was most impressed with Paul Giamatti as Inspector Uhl. His conflict in being forced to arrest a man he clearly respects and whose mysteries he long to solve. Giammatti also provides most of the laughs in the film, and reminded me of the fantastic Claude Rains in Casablanca. <br/><br/>There were a few problems with the movie: Inspector Uhl's narration seemed out of place and put the story in an odd time line. Also, the love story was just too pat and was not given enough time to develop into a believable affair. Just suspend your disbelief and go along with the idea that two childhood sweethearts would reunite after 15 years of separation and a plethora of logistical boundaries. The love story aspect really sums up why the film isn't better: its not that it lacks chemistry, it lacks a spark. The stakes aren't quite high enough to make us completely engrossed in the film. The level of suspense isn't quite enough to make us forget everything and only follow where the characters lead. <br/><br/>The Illusionist is a well made, entertaining film with a quality story and performances, but it ultimately lacks that elusive oomph to make it into something really special."
"Solipsisticblog","8","0","1","18 August 2006"," ""They don't make 'em like this anymore""
","Late Summer often leaves us with movies that are high concept and low quality. (See ""Snakes on a Plane."") Movies often get placed in the August doldrums because they are hard to market, as well. That must be the case for ""The Illusionist"" because it is a film of sterling quality. It had my audience gasping, laughing, clapping, and held us generally enthralled.<br/><br/>""The Illusionist"" tells a story as old as the hills. Lower class boy falls in love with a young girl of royalty. Girl returns love. Boy and girl are separated. Boy leaves home, grows talented and swift-witted. Returns to win girl from evil Prince. Don't let this description discourage you. This movie takes this old tale and makes it fresh and gripping.<br/><br/>The young boy grows to be the illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and returns to his hometown of Vienna where he meets the Girl, Sophie (Jessica Biel) who is soon to marry the scheming Prince (Rufus Sewell). The illusionist, though, is not a boring do-gooder, but a troubled and intense craftsmen. You are never sure if his emotions and actions are genuine or are all part of a larger scheme. Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is assigned by the Prince to keep track of the crafty Eisenheim.<br/><br/>""The Illusisionist"" is filmed in sepia tones and uses much of the syntax of silent era films. It never becomes distracting, however. In fact, this movie is an excellent example of how to use special effects to benefit the story rather than as an end unto themselves. Eisenheim's illusions are a wonder to behold. The movie also includes one of our greatest character actors, Paul Giamatti. Go see if for no other reason than to enjoy his work.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that will have older audiences saying ""They don't make 'em like that anymore."" It's truly a throwback. The violence is negligible and more implied than explicit. The one sex scene is tame as well. It is an excellent, gripping story well told. That it is based on a short story should be no surprise given its storytelling economy. It is a succinct film with interesting twists that never stops moving. My parents are gonna live this one. (I really liked it, too.)"

","My husband and I had the opportunity to attend a screener of the ""Illusionist."" I didn't know what to expect because I hadn't seen a lot of promotion for it. The film was wonderful. I enjoyed it so much that I've offered to take my mother to see it this weekend when it officially opens. Visually the movie was stunning. The lighting, costumes and settings helped accent the dramatic storyline. The best part of the film was the acting. I forgot how great of an actor Ed Norton is. Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel more then hold their own. The only reason I didn't give ""The Illusionist"" a 10 out of 10 was the old fashion fade in and outs that were used. It was just a little off-putting for me. All in all, this is a fantastic movie and should be viewed on the big screen. You won't regret it!"

","I think The Illusionist is a rewarding gift to audiences who enjoy historical thrillers, procedural mysteries and character-driven dramas. The sepia-toned cinematography for this picture delivers lovely vintage postcard landscapes and cityscapes of 19th century Vienna. The visually stunning illusions performed by the main character are integral to unraveling the murder mystery, and most important of all, Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti turn in well-delineated, but restrained performances that keep the film from being derailed into a Masterpiece/Mobil Mystery television production. Norton's and Giamatti's specific characterizations make this film feel inventive, as opposed to many British costume dramas that feel stagy and barely differentiated from the page. I think the chemistry exhibited between Norton and Giamatti are felt in some of the film's best scenes. Their performances, as well as the film's look, make The Illusionist feel deceptively original, although it is apparently based on a novel. This film has the thrill of Fred Zinnemann's The Day of the Jackal and the romance found in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet. These story elements should make the film appealing to a broad spectrum of filmgoers--as was apparent at the screening I attended where there was applause when the credits rolled."

","Like some others who have posted, I figured some things out about 20 minutes before I was supposed to, but I was still entertained by the ride. The foreshadowing was a bit obvious, however, Norton and Giamatti were outstanding and Jessica Biel held her own, although her part was far more shallow. And despite the predictability of many plot lines, the filmmakers did a great job with Giamatti's chief of police character -- I was never quite sure where he was coming from or how he fit in.<br/><br/>Great work for a first-time writer/director. Curious to see how it will fare at the box office (I saw a preview screening in Baltimore)."
