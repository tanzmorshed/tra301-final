","Normally the sequel to a movie is a let down. Especially if the first part was really good. I think that's what's happened with Ocean's 12 for many but l hope this doesn't mean that they won't be watching '13'.<br/><br/>I was happy to see all of the same characters and actors together again because that is one big cool cast. Not to mention Al Pacino...icing on the cake.Who could resist?<br/><br/>For those who are in doubt about Ocean's 13, i hope you're not affected by some bad reviews because history doesn't repeat itself with this one. It's got an interesting story and some fabulous actors and acting. Don't miss out."
"Screen-Space","4","131","175","7 June 2007"," A lot going on, but nothing much happening....
","Ocean Thirteen's slick credit sequence, highlighting Brad Pitt in all his movie star glory and letting us all know that Soderbergh and his camera are up for some glossy fun, gets the heart racing in anticipation of a slick, sly heist caper on par with #1 and superior to #2.<br/><br/>But then, as detail upon detail is heaped upon the audience and increasingly silly machinations are put in place to ensure the casino-robbery plan works, it all starts to unravel until, burdened by its own only-in-the-movies logic, the film grinds to a halt just when it should be at its most exciting.<br/><br/>At the 80 minute mark, the film, in desperate need of a compelling story to kick-in, is still setting up the details of the heist. No tension has been created, no forward momentum is in place, no characters are established sufficiently to root for. Soderbergh is no doubt hoping the good will audiences have for his characters from the first film is still in place here (sorely tested in Oceans Twelve). And despite taking all this time to create a detailed if rather ludicrous heist plan, it then boils down to relying on coincidence rather than cunning for it all to work.<br/><br/>Clooney and Pitt still have the charisma and chemistry to make some moments enjoyable, but there isn't the zing in their banter that was a highlight of the first film. Other returning cast members - Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Andy Garcia - are all reduced to plot devices rather than given any substance (I know this isn't meant to be a in-depth character piece, but gimme somebody to care about and not just ogle!). Best moments come from Scott Cann and Casey Affleck; most embarrassing from Don Cheadle. And though Al Pacino is suitably villainous as the bad guy, he's also the most interesting and compelling character in the film, making his ultimate downfall (which, lets face it, is no spoiler) a little bittersweet (I would've liked to have seen him slap Danny Ocean up the side of the head, if only to create a little spark in the film).<br/><br/>What is sorely missing is a strong female character. Julia Roberts provided it in #1; Julia and Catherine Zeta-Jones were the best things about #2. In O13, Ellen Barkin is reduced to playing Pacino's 2IC as a blindly-ambitious slut, and its awful. Other female characters are either casino-pit screechers or hookers, underlying the boys-own macho-ness of these films.<br/><br/>It does look great in parts - the set design and CGI work is impeccable - and Soderbergh, holding his own camera under the name 'Peter Andrews', shoots his cast and the locales sumptuously in deep, rich reds and golden tones. But at 122 minutes its a long slog.<br/><br/>With a triumvirate of blah threequels this American summer already clogging multiplexes, Ocean Thirteens only adds weight to the argument that if anything interesting or inspired is going to be done with the characters or plot in a franchise film, its already been done by the time a #3 is churned out."

","I liked ""Oceans 13,"" but I wanted to love it.<br/><br/>I love the handsome stars, the great clothes, the nifty sets, the music -- David Holmes' score is a really fun, retro trip back to 1965. I love the deadpan delivery of funny lines: ""I just bit into a pepper,"" a man says, when caught tearing up. I love the payoff when scams reach their climax.<br/><br/>But I wanted this movie to thrill me as the previous ""Ocean"" movies have, and, while it was a slick good time, it wasn't memorable.<br/><br/>There is less character development here than in previous movies. Ocean is not pursuing Tess. Linus has pretty much proved himself.<br/><br/>There wasn't the spectacular stunts as performed by Shaobo Qin in ""Ocean's 11"" or Vincent Cassel in ""Ocean's 12."" ""Ocean's 13"" doesn't fully exploit Las Vegas -- we've seen this movie's Las Vegas before.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is kind of blah as the villain. I wasn't afraid of him; I just kept wondering why he had orange hair. Andy Garcia is more juicy in a smaller, ambivalent role.<br/><br/>The movie resuscitates the film career of Ellen Barkin. She looks spectacular: flat stomach, legs to die for, magnificent cleavage. And then what do they do? Humiliate her and make a bitter comment about how she is a woman ""of a certain age."" ""Oceans 13"" would have been a better movie if it had made better use of this hot actress. A sex scene between her and the ever cool Matt Damon would have perked the movie up."
"r96sk","8","6","6","13 February 2020"," A tad drawn out though it does deliver by the end
","'Ocean's Thirteen' marks the end of the Ocean's trilogy in a good way.<br/><br/>It's slightly below the level of 'Ocean's Eleven' but does better 'Ocean's Twelve'. As with the preceding two, the cast elevate these films up with strong performances from George Clooney & Co. In regards to O13, I feel the plot is a tad drawn out though it does deliver by the end with its entertaining outcome."
"insectnation","6","112","170","19 June 2007"," Entertaining Yet Forgettable
","I went to see this movie with only one expectation, surely it cant be as bad as the second film. On this front i was greatly pleased as the sense of smugness surrounding twelve has been completely lost. The only real problem i had was that after the film finished i really struggled to remember anything particularly about it.<br/><br/>The performances were all OK but no one really stood out, whereas Matt Damon was the only person i didn't want to slap in twelve, he never gets the chance to shine. Al Pacino has no chance to make a memorable villain out of the limited screen time leaving you not really caring if they can pull off the job or not. Clooney and Pitt also do an OK job of an average script, but it never rises above OK.<br/><br/>The area i think this film falls down is with a cast that is too big, while inventive and different in the first film, just hinders this one. There are too many people trying to get their five minutes on screen to really give a damn. Maybe this is the directors feels we already care about them as we know the characters, when in reality the damage caused by twelve was enough to need character building again. Arguably a plot on a smaller scale would have been better with a sharp focus on one or two characters as in the first film.<br/><br/>While flashy this film is all about style over substance and if you are looking for a shallow but entertaining summer movie this may just be it."
"andydreamseeker","7","134","215","7 June 2007"," Movie Review: Ocean's Thirteen
","So they're back, for a third time, after Ocean's Eleven in 2001 and Ocean's Twelve in 2004. First they took out three of Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) Las Vegas casinos at one go with a smart and clever plan in Eleven, then they had to pay it all back with interest to Benedict in Twelve by staging a different theft, now in Thirteen the team of eleven are back to casino stealing with a little help from again, Benedict.<br/><br/>The unlucky guy is Willy Banks (Al Pacino) who owns a series of highly rated ""5 Diamonds"" hotels. The team is not in for the money this round but for revenge because Banks had done the disfavour of first knocking Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), one of the Eleven, from a hotel deal causing the man a heart-attack and a sudden lost in zest for life. You could say old Willy Banks had it coming for him because his ego was too big for himself. He had without any regards dismissed the Eleven's attempt for him to reinstate Reuben's share of the hotel.<br/><br/>As it reads, ""What are the odds of getting even? 13 to 1."" It's time to place your bet.<br/><br/>Good guys versus bad guys. I cannot really call thieves good guys can I? How about nice guys then? These guys are nice. They have a sentimental heart. They watch Oprah. These guys are nice. They have a heart of gold. They will do anything for a friend. And these guys are cool, handsome and funny too.<br/><br/>Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Virgil Malloy (Casey Affleck), Turk Malloy (Scott Caan), Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner), Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), ""The Amazing"" Yen (Shaobo Qin), Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) and Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) make up the Eleven. Strong cast and strong performance is to describe the ensemble.<br/><br/>Let me re-familiarize you to the team. Danny and Rusty are the mastermind and deputy. Linus is the rookie turned master thief. Frank is the professional dealer. Virgil and Turk are brothers who are experts in everything (they kind of do everything and run everywhere). Saul is the old and characteristic actor con-artiste. Basher is the demolition and machinery expert. ""The Amazing"" Yen is the well the amazing Yen who is skilled in acrobatic. Livingston is the guru in surveillance and an electronic geek. And of course lastly we have Reuben who is the old man with the money and Danny's mentor.<br/><br/>No worries if you can't remember their roles. You can't be blamed for that. There are after all eleven of them. Just remember them as master of disguises. Lots of that will appear in the film.<br/><br/>What make a film like Ocean's Thirteen worth watching is watching all the characters. It is fun to see all of them coming together in their own way to give the story its life. The acting is in one word, superb. And the actor who plays the bad guy, Willy Banks, Al Pacino is great. The facial expression whenever the veteran actor appears on screen is beyond words. Those eyes and that look, brilliant. Banks right hand man, or woman, and the only mentionable actress in Ocean's Thirteen is Abigail Sponder (Ellen Barkin), and she's foxy.<br/><br/>The story is not that complicated and I can't spoil it by telling. It is basically the eleven taking revenge on Banks with a little help from Benedict. There'll be the usual witty dialogues, the underlying funny relationship among the team members and of course the all-important ploy of how to breach into ego Willy's hotel casino on its opening night. For a film of such fashion, the most interesting part will always be how smart the plan to steal is being done. In Ocean's Thirteen it is not bad and quite exaggerated. For the audience I advise taking the consideration of logic out of the equation and just enjoy all the action on screen as they are. There is no need to be too hard or too smart about it. The main point to this film is to enjoy the humour.<br/><br/>The chill-out, atmospheric and ambient music by composer David Holmes is one of the factors that give this movie series its slick aesthetics. Ocean's Thirteen bettered its last effort of Twelve though not quite as clever, smart and interesting as Eleven. A first tough act was always hard to follow but director Steven Soderbergh gave this one a decent account.<br/><br/>It is easier to enjoy the movie than to dislike it. I like the small part about the hotel reviewer and the jackpot and felt it was a nice touch. If I were to put the film more critically though, I would say that it is not as smooth and the flavour not as strong. Sounds like I'm describing an ice-cream? It is like ice-cream with all the actors and actress in this one. Now who doesn't like ice-cream right?<br/><br/>Any flavour will do as long as it's sweet, cool and topped with some crunch."
"alexkolokotronis","7","36","54","3 February 2009"," A Good Movie To Watch And Multi-Task With
","Have you ever watched a film while multi-tasking? Well if you have, you should do it again but this time put on Ocean's Thirteen. I would not describe myself as a fan of the Oceans' movies but I have pretty much enjoyed all of them. In light of that though this is the worst one of the series.<br/><br/>The movie is very well acted in that it appears the whole cast has fun with the material from top to bottom. That does not make it a good film though it just makes it a nice to get together. One thing I could say though was this time around I actually noticed Casey Affleck because of his recent breakout performances in other films. So with that, he and Al Pacino just adds to the fun of watching all the great actors and stars in the film. The script is very witty at times and did have me chuckle more often then not. What was missing though were the star actresses. Tangle in all the fun of a crazy scheme to rob a casino, gambling and just Las Vegas is the women. It would have been great to see Julia Roberts or Catherina Zeta Jones or even both back for the film. Instead we had to settle with Ellen Barkin who has not nearly as an impressive career or persona as her counterparts.<br/><br/>As the rest of the series this film really is not too thought provoking or deep. It won't inspire you to do something so honestly it won't be too necessary to focus all your thoughts on this film. This is an entertaining film considering George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac and Casey Affleck are in it but yet it isn't as well made or enjoyable as its predecessors."

","I was a huge fan of Ocean's Eleven, it was smart, witty, funny and in my opinion the best remake I have ever seen. The great cast and the smart dialogue just made it a pleasure to watch, leading my expectations to reach phenomenal levels before seeing its follow up, Ocean's Twelve. So perhaps that is why Ocean's Twelve seemed such a let down, my expectations were to high. As a result of this originally my expectations for Ocean's Thirteen were horribly low, I contemplated not even seeing it at one point. However after re watching Ocean's Eleven, I decided to give it a chance, perhaps Soderbergh at made an effort this time, perhaps it would reclaim the glory of the original movie. Thankfully it has not only reclaimed my respect for the series, but also produced, in my eyes, the best entry so far. The return to Las Vegas has also seen a return of a great script, a plot that is followable, decent jokes and also just a sense of fun that Ocean's Twelve was sorely lacking. In many ways this makes up for the mistake that was the past movie, this is the sequel we should have had. In actual fact, apart from maybe a couple of details, this movie has next to nothing following on from the second movie. This is a good thing as it allows more people to see the quality first movie and then not have to worry about seeing the horrific second one before seeing the best of the series.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven worked particularly well because of its starry cast, and the fact the cast were clearly having an absolute ball making the movie. We had George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and loads more. Ocean's Twelve saw the inclusion of more stars, including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel. In Ocean's Thirteen two of the cast members have gone, thankfully the lack of Julia Roberts and Zeta-Jones doesn't leave a mark at all. In fact it seems a bit of a breath of fresh air, and even fresher when the reasoning for them not being in the movie is explained with one line of dialogue. But to make up for their disappearance we get Al Pacino in their stead, and trust me he more than makes up for it. Andy Garcia was a great villain in the original, but he lack the menace that Al Pacino has. He easily steals the beginning of the movie, and he threatens to steal it for the whole movie as well. He isn't overused, and he's certainly never underused. He's the best villain this series has had and it makes the quality of the movie increase. But of course this is still the original elevens' movie, and all of them get their moments to shine. George Clooney is still the best, he's such a great actor to watch as he just oozes star quality. He's the kind of person you wouldn't mind meeting in real life because he seems a genuinely nice guy. He's also used more in this movie, unlike in Twelve where he seemed to co-star in a movie with his name in the title. Brad Pitt is used less than Twelve here, and thankfully that works as well. My biggest problem with Twelve was the fact Rusty took centre stage, and in my opinion Rusty isn't an interesting character. In small doses he's brilliant, but in large doses his character just isn't good enough. Matt Damon has some great comedic moments here and there, Andy Garcia continues his role with style, Eddie Izzard's character actually seems to have a point here, and all the rest of the cast just carries on perfectly. They're all having a blast and they put their all into this movie.<br/><br/>So what of the actual storyline then? Well the actual motives for this movie seems to have improved a lot. Ocean's Twelve's storyline just didn't work for me, I liked the fact that they had to re-pay their money to Bennedict, but I didn't like the fact it got all involved with Vincent Cassel's jewel thief. Here though its all about revenge, and it works better here. It also helps that Al Pacino's Willy Bank is such a jerk that you can't wait to see the gang exact their revenge on him. How they do it, and if they do it I will leave as a surprise, and trust me there are a few little surprises install along the way. Some characters show up that you don't expect to show up, and also the movies pacing is tremendous. It throws you in at the deep end, the planning stage isn't very long, its all about the actual heist pretty much. The opening and the first half is generally talking, which some people might dislike. I personally loved it as the conversations were brilliant, and the quick fire dialogue a welcome relief from the clunky blockbuster stuff I'm used to at the moment. <br/><br/>Overall Ocean's Thirteen is a masterclass in smart, silly blockbusters. Its storyline is preposterous, and how the heist goes is a bit silly, but that's part of the fun, that's what makes the Ocean's series in general such a blast. The movies ooze style (yes even Twelve to some extent). If this is the final movie of the Ocean's series, and I personally believe it is, then they have the left the series on a very high. This has the potential to end up being the best Blockbuster of the summer, a surprise as I really didn't expect much from this. I highly recommend it, its cool, funny slick and most importantly of all, very cool."
"CinemaClown","Null","6","7","8 September 2017"," Slightly Better Than Its Predecessor But Still No Match To The Original
","Slightly better than Ocean's Twelve but still not close to Ocean's Eleven, the third & final entry in The Ocean's Trilogy finds the original gang returning to Las Vegas for one last heist as things get a bit personal in this concluding chapter. Retaining the cool style & lighthearted vibe of its predecessors, the film does many things right but is still forgettable in the end.<br/><br/>The story of Ocean's Thirteen is set in motion when one of the original eleven is double crossed by his former business partner who now owns his new hotel-casino. When the gang finds out about it, they decide to avenge him by concocting a plan to spoil the new hotel's opening night but to pull it off, they turn to a foe who shares their contempt for the common enemy and offers his assistance.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Ocean's Thirteen marks a little improvement over its predecessor and, by taking a persona route, brings something new to the table. The light, playful tone remains in tact but the premise is more involving than it was the last time. Also, unlike the previous entry, the new addition to the ensemble plays a key role in the plot and has an interesting arc of his own.<br/><br/>While the story has an interesting outline, the writers still end up making the plot complex and not easy to follow. Not every twist n turn makes sense, some moments are as ludicrous as the second film's museum robbing sequence, and it expects the viewer to just go along with everything that's unfolding without questioning the logic of it all. Sometimes, it does work. Other times, it doesn't.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the original eleven return to reprise their respective roles once again. Vincent Cassel also makes an appearance while the most notable amongst the new additions is Al Pacino who plays the antagonist and utilises his infectious persona to great effect. Clooney & Pitt once again lead from the front but Damon gets a promotion as well while the rest play their part as expected.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ocean's Thirteen is a satisfactory conclusion to the saga of Danny Ocean & his associates, if not a memorable one, and offers a good, lighthearted dose of fun & amusement just like its predecessors. It corrects a few mistakes that were made in the second instalment but also ends up creating some new ones which stop it from reaching the heights & delights of the original. Nevertheless, it's worth a shot."
"Highco","6","67","117","12 June 2007"," Great design, great technical realization, good actors but weak story
","Since I am a fan of the first two movies I expected a funny and thrilling film. What carried the viewer through its predecessors (great retro design, music etc.) now isn't enough for a really good movie. The story itself could be summed up too quickly. The preparation for the big thievery starts almost from the beginning of the film and it's justification is really poor. What can be really enjoyed are the colorful visuals and a bunch of stars that seem to enjoy themselves. All this prevents a worse vote. To me it seems that Hollywood is running out on ideas at the moment. Sequels are obviously attractive from a financial point of view but bear the risk that they are produced and conceived not careful enough."

","Danny Ocean and his Eleven are back in Las Vegas. This time, Danny tries to talk sense into Willie Bank, the owner of a series of highly rated ""5 Diamonds"" hotels who double-crossed one of Eleven, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), on a hotel deal causing the man a heart-attack and coma-like state. After the ruthless and arrogant Bank suggests that Reuben ""rolls over and dies"", Danny and his team decide to take the Bank's stunning new casino out of business on the big opening night. <br/><br/>The third Ocean's movie is great fun and a wonderful mixture of genres that works as comedy/crime/thriller/revenge. Vegas is spectacular. The jokes are funny, the dialogs are witty, the directing is first class with the split screens, unusual angles, and the camera that always moves fast but does not rush. The acting is terrific. The absence of Julia Roberts and Katherine Zeta Jones is more than compensated by the presence of great Ellen Barkin who is a better actress than two and a hot beautiful woman, the real ""cougar"". Besides Ocean and his Eleven (who all have fun with their parts but this time Carl Reiner was simply outstanding), it was good to see David Paymer as an unlucky (or was he?) hotel reviewer and Eddie Izzard as a famous computer hacker. Did I mention that Al Pacino took the role of Willie Bank and he was excellent playing in his quiet mode without screaming which I like a lot? There are certainly the holes in the story and the absence of logic but I did not care a bit. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not about logic or plausibility or realism, it is all about fun and entertaining and it entertains admirably. It is a very successful and enjoyable sequel in the series of Ocean's movies and we all know that good sequels don't happen too often."

It reminded me of a Mission Impossible TV show or Movie where the details are the most important thing going. Here there are too many details and I got lost trying to fit everything in place so I just didn't pay any attention to them after a while and hoped for some face-time with the all-star cast. Didn't happen. The stars ran into and out of the scenes at breakneck speed, mumbled a few lines and we were on to another scene for more of the same. <br/><br/>I knew what they were trying to do, bankrupt Willy Bank, and I suppose that is all you need to know. But, the mumbling, dashing in and out of scenes caused a loss in continuity for me.. I didn't care if Willy Bank got his. So to me, this was a complete waste of star-power and story. I think the director had a time limit on how long each scene would take to be shot and he beat his schedule all the way through. Director: 1. Audience: 0. <br/><br/>Then when everything was in place and Bank was about to lose all, I didn't care when all the now-rigged games made winners of everyone playing. I didn't get any joy out of that. So what was the point? I felt nothing. When you watch a movie you should feel something. Okay, well I did. I felt this was a tedious and boring movie where a lot of star-power was thoroughly wasted, and the story suffered because of too many details.<br/><br/>Let's hope there is no Ocean's Fourteen.<br/><br/>Violence:No, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No"
"vinniejo","2","23","38","25 October 2007"," Why make it in the first place??
","I've never been a fan of the Ocean's series. I saw Ocean's 11 & found it to be a drab affair without a good script .George Clooney was the only guy who held that movie together. This is why I chose to avoid Ocean's 12. But when Ocean's 13 was about to release, I was really excited because it had Al Pacino in it. Alas! Even he could not save this movie.<br/><br/>It was another movie which involved robbery of a Casino. I don't know as to where to begin with while criticizing the movie. Its script was shabby & all over the place with a number of loopholes. Why was it such a big deal that Rueben was kicked out by Willie Bank? Why Ellen Barkin was portrayed as a gullible secretary of Willie Bank? The ideas given by Matt Damon were ridiculous to say the least. The earthquake thing was simply not digestible. The way the Chinese guy entered the hotel, it made the entire hotel staff look stupid. The dialogues & one-liners were all drab & out of place. The whole concept of changing the dies & manipulating the gambling results was too far fetched. The pace of the movie was lightening fast & so it was difficult to catch up with it. The technological & gizmo jargon could be understood only by rocket scientists. Needless to say Al Pacino was completely wasted.<br/><br/>The direction by Steven Soderbergh was clumsy. Most of the actors were wooden faced and the whole thing just couldn't come alive at any point of time. It looked as if the actors were all directing themselves.<br/><br/>I just fail to understand the logic of remaking such a pathetic series. Why would top actors in Hollywood join hands to create one disaster of a flick? Not once, not twice, but three times in a row.<br/><br/>It's high time that this series is brought to an end for the benefit of all the movie-goers around the world."

They steal in a very civilized way, almost with a prim kind of detachment. George Clooney, which I love, is starting to look oldish and very feminine. was this on purpose? Brad Pitt is always chewing something and is always so close to Clooney that they could become a duo if not a pair. Matt Damon tries a nose but it won't have the repercussions of Nicole Kidman's. Here the nose is strictly four laughs and it almost succeeded. Ellen Barkin looks smashing for a woman of ""her age"" and rich, she looks rich. Andy Garcia walks through it well dressed and trying to cling on to something. His Oprah interview got me to laugh a little bit. Al Pacino, well, I don't know what to say. I'm not saying he should be angry with his director but should sue the Director Of Photography. At times he looked like my late aunt Margo. What was that? Listen, I'm not being facetious. I'm just treating the movie the way the movie treated me. Moronically. I got tired of seeing this rich actors make more money. This was my last Ocean, no matter how many more they throw my way."
"barberoux","5","41","78","16 June 2007"," Better than 12 but not by much
","Ocean's Thirteen was better than Ocean's 12. That isn't saying much since O12 was horrible. O13 was a tad better. Al Pacino helped by creating a character who was believable and entertaining. Ellen Barkin was terribly miscast. Her role would have been played better by some riper, younger actress. Brad Pitt look very please with himself and George Clooney avoided being too smug. Neither were all that entertaining and the movie focused on them most of the time. I thought the movie was slow. The caper consisted of solving a series of problems in rigging all of the gambling at Al Pacino's casino. The rigging was accomplished with a bunch of unexplained, magical devices. It felt more like Wily E. Coyote's Acme products than actual plausible products. The mine digging machine was ridiculous. It was way too fantastical to be believed. The rigging of the diamond prize was clever and believable. The trouble with sequels is that the characters are not developed further but are just referred to in a kind of role shorthand. The whole screenplay was a shorthand version of a caper movie. The Ocean story is that these really clever guys have to rob an entire casino against great odds which they accomplish with neato devices and tricks. This movie followed the outline but failed to develop the robbery techniques beyond magical Acme devices. How did pouring powder in the dice raw material actually make the dice roll over by pressing another magic device? It wasn't engineering it was magic. The movie required one to suspend too much belief in reality to make the caper work. A drilling machine in the middle of a major city, that breaks and has to be replaced in a day, and bores a huge tunnel under the city with no one noticing. Come on! It would take months for a team of engineers to accomplish the task of just getting the machine started. The caper just didn't work. The ensemble casting wasn't an ensemble. It was three stars with other people around. The acting wasn't terrible but just egocentric. Wait for a dark and stormy night and rent it."

","Everyone who's buying a ticket for this movie (like me), obviously liked the two first.

In my opinion this add made me not totally slaughter the movie, he was (as always) incredible in the role of casino owner Mr.Bank. The rest of the cast is actually just themselves, George Clooney plays George Clooney, and Brad Pitt- well, Brad Pitt... The actors is just enjoying themselves with what they know will be a box-office success anyways, so they don't really put in any effort.<br/><br/>Soderbergh really misses out on the poor dialog and (at some parts) confusing scenes, which makes everyone scratching their heads... You're looking for some scenes which makes you bite your nails(?)- look somewhere else, this movie has none! Soderbergh you should be ashamed- what a waste of talent! But, we all expected it- and as stupid as we are (myself included), we just hope that the amazing cast will make the movie worth while- as it should. It doesn't. Don't be fooled by the Big names, this is a movie that you wanna forget the second you go out of the theater! 3/10 (some points because of Pacino)"

","I was waiting for ""Ocean's Thirteen"" with a lot of excitement since George Clooney is one of my favourite actors but I was absolutely disappointed when finally watching the movie. Although the actors played very well, the plot was weird and it was hard to follow the story. To make it even worse, although it was said that the ""job"" was literally impossible everything seemed to be too easy and just a matter of money to be spent. The audience never had the impression that Danny and his buddies really had to struggle for their mission's accomplishment.<br/><br/>To put it in a nutshell: I hope there won't be an ""Ocean's Fourteen""."

","""The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief."" Shakespeare's Othello <br/><br/>Andy Garcia's wealthy Terry Benedict is financing Danny Ocean's Vegas heist from casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino) in order to get the last smile of vengeance, thief to thief, while Danny and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) exact their own revenge. No honor among these slick reprobates, and good time is had by all the men and, this time, not Julia Roberts, but Clooney's real-life squeeze, Ellen Barkin, as Abigail Sponder, tough right hand to Bank.<br/><br/>I go to most movies as a film critic with my sensibility well-guarded against the fluffy confection of just another heist. But the Ocean's franchise, like the Bond's, has a cachet all its own with eye-pleasing duds, high-tech high jinx, and self-referential dialogue. Thus I am free to enjoy without feeling as if I'd sold out to crass commercialismI have, but willfully and pleasurably.<br/><br/>I guess I'm sucked in like everyone else at the movies, even with as many as I've seen and written about, because I want to go where the director, in this case the estimable Steven Soderbergh, wants to take me. In Ocean's 12, it was all over Europe; in Thirteen it's the entertainment Mecca of the Western world.<br/><br/>No deep thoughts come to mind, just summer mindlessness dressed up for partying (Pitt and Clooney very nicely decked out, understatedly). Clooney's musings about the changes in Vegas since guys like him had shaken Sinatra's hand serves as ""change"" leitmotif lighter than air. Twenty years from now we'll be talking about the iconic Pitt and Clooney in the same nostalgic way. Ocean's Thirteen reinforces its place in popular culture as a repository for our transitory adulation of movie stars and the escapes they gave us long ago.<br/><br/>At the end, Matt Damon exits with ""See you when I see you,"" a fitting piece of noncommittal that may promise another Ocean's installment or just more star sightings. Clooney says goodbye to Pitt with an in-joke the world is in on: ""Hey! Next time! Keep the weight off. Pitt retorts, ""Have a couple of kids."" This is typical of the low-key, sweetly narcissistic third installment.<br/><br/>Ocean's hits a lucky thirteen this time around without a big jackpot but a great deal of good will."

","Just got back from from watching this and I'd have to say it's probably the best film I've seen in about six months. It definitely cheered me up after that disappointing Spiderman sequel. Don't get me wrong Ocean's 13 is not quite as good as 11 but it's still a good watch (Big improvement on the second one). The absence of Catherine Zeta Jones and Julia Roberts was a bit of a surprise, but I doubt their presence would have improved the film greatly. The addition of the great Al Pacino was definitely a big positive and as usual he played his role well and brought a lot to the film. The action sequence were well done, there are quite a few funny segments in the film involving some pretty hilarious disguises. The camera work and techniques are excellent. The story was a big improvement on O-12 but I agree with what I read in another review, that it definitely lacked the suspense of the first one. Nothing really happened where the whole plan went to cock and they had to quickly come up with an even more ingenious plan or else all was doomed. It was more like, oh no somethings broken, what do we do? I know, lets buy a replacement, Phew! Apart from that, everyone played their roles fantastically, with the exception of maybe Eddie Izzard who I think was a little off character, which I found disappointing because I really enjoyed his short part in the O-12. In summary I'd say; Room for improvement, still a really good film, definitely worth the price of admission."

Those facts in and of themselves make this movie a sham. But willfully suspending disbelief of that- O's 13 has plenty else to make it implausible in the extreme. And plenty less to make it fun to watch.<br/><br/>If the enjoyability of your movie depends entirely on the personalities of your actors, and Ocean's most certainly does, then you'd better come up with something cool for them to say and do. Not so, here. The ludicrous nature of the caper and the complete lack of meaningful interplay among its protagonists wipes the flick free of anything like personality. The enjoyable things about Ocean's 11 (snappy dialogue,witty repartees, cool suits, clever dupes, intriguing subplots, etc.) have been completely exorcised. Now all we've got left are a bunch of cool guys without a script talking shop about pulling off an unbelievable, altruistically motivate non-heist (they're not even in it for the money).

","I feel like a broken record, but I need to say it again: Ocean's Thirteen is the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade make-up film (to Temple of Doom.) Now, I am actually an unapologetic supporter of Ocean's Twelve, but I truly and really liked this chapter.<br/><br/>Does it match the original's originality, even though that was a remake? No, but it comes pretty damn close. Andthey made it back to Vegas, where they belong.<br/><br/>The gang gathers around a fallen and deceived member and comes up with a brilliant and often hilarious plot to thwart the great Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Literally, that's the plot. Now, I don't mean to downplay itI had an absolute blast here, but also admired this movie tremendously.<br/><br/>For example, the graphics and locations were amazing. I'm a stickler for ""getting Vegas right."" Con Air had the strip all over the place, including casinos/hotels that didn't even exist when the movie premiered. The movie 21 had ""our heroes"" stay in the Green Valley Ranch that had a convenient view of the strip, even though the strip is miles away. In Ocean's Thirteen, there was a fake casino erected, and the location they gave, it made sense. Even the views from the place and hotel rooms was accurate – had this place existed.<br/><br/>The comedy was back, the tension and fun was relevant and the suspense was key. If you loved 2001's Ocean's Eleven and that does happen to be one of my all-time favorite movies, you should truly love this. (Yeah, it helps if you saw Part ""Twelve,"" but not 100% necessary.)"

No real surprises and the characters are so one-dimensional that it feels more like watching a cartoon movie. The director missed a huge opportunity getting all those big actors together. But it seems that screen-play just did not have enough substance for 90 minutes. What I found frustrating was that at some points the story line was not logical.

","""Ocean's Thirteen"" is a glitzy, gaudy joke. Unfortunately for the audience, though, the joke is on them. I have felt more self-respect after visiting gypsy fortune tellers than I have after seeing this pile of glamorous, conceited, nothing. An Alka-Seltzer has more substance to it than this movie.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, fewer and fewer people are going to remember that this movie is based on the 1960's Las Vegas so-called ""Rat Pack"" of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., comedian Joey Bishop, and actor Peter Lawford. For all their talents, all of them were on the down-side of their careers, some sliding faster than others. Considerations of money aside, once you reach Vegas your creative career is over. Next stop, Atlantic City. The Rat Pack were famous for being famous, and everything they did was some sort of unfunny in-joke. Nevertheless, the one positive thing you can say about them is that they were who they were.<br/><br/>With the Ocean's Thirteen bunch, though, they are not who they are. George Clooney may appeal to many people, but no one can accuse him of having a surfeit of talent. Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are still decent actors, but you'd never know it from the roles they play in this piece of self-centered fluff. One of them should have given up his role to Ben Affleck, an actor much more suited to the vapidity of these roles. And to see Al Pacino in this film is practically a national tragedy.<br/><br/>Mostly, though, I'm mad at myself for ignoring my movie instincts and for joining my fellow movie-going lemmings in donating money to the makers of this idiotic enterprise. See, the joke is on me."
"tedg","Null","13","24","17 June 2007"," Sexual Editing
","Is this the most valuable franchise in film? Will it last for a decade?<br/><br/>I like Soderbergh. I even like him when he has no goal in the world but making money through simple entertaining.<br/><br/>I like him because he actually thinks about film. About the bullets the towels. The phrases and melodies.<br/><br/>Superficially, this has two overt components. One is the well established con form. The strict version is that we don't fully understand what is going on and ""see"" it only at the end. Then it all makes sense. This is a weaker version where we see some of the plotting and problems. This is where the jokes are.<br/><br/>The second overt component is simply coolness. Its the sort of coolness that Apple-inspired ad editing has given us, in opposition to the heavy rap-gangster intimidation-coolness of the last great sales cycle. This is referenced within the movie with a bit about an all American black jumper (with a Jewelled flag on his teeth). Its colorful, fast. The pace is translucent with the music. Vegas Cellophane. The actors are cool. Even Matt Damon, who knows cool, plays uncool with coolness.<br/><br/>But its the technique here that impresses. Shots have shape and how those shapes are modulated (as they usually are not) and then assembled with those shapes forming new ones, is a matter of unique style with this filmmaker. Look at how fertile soft ends are punctured by sharp beginnings so that the very passage of time in the eye here is a matter of conceptual copulation.<br/><br/>Look at how many shots end on one of those colored artificial flavors and create a romantic movie at the atomic level as if a John Coltrane was compressing a thousand easy ballads into a few moments. This takes knowledge and the filmmaker has to actually operate the camera to pull this off. It was in his ""Limey"" and not in the other Ocean's. <br/><br/>And it takes an editor who knows. The best editor was found fresh off ""Babel"" which among other variations, had the three segments vary on shotshape assembly. This matters. This is a five diamond film, yes?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","After the events of the previous films the gang are now going straight. One of them, Ruben, is even starting his own casino in Las Vegas unfortunately his business partner Willy Banks cons him out of his half of the business and seems to find it funny when Ruben collapses and is hospitalised. Danny Ocean decides that they must get back together and take Banks for everything he's got. This won't be a conventional heist; they intend to rig a number of games so that the casino will have to pay out a massive $500,000,000 on its opening night. Since it is so personal for them they are also determined to ensure that the casino doesn't win the prestigious 'Five Diamonds' award for this casino and steal the four diamond necklaces he had made to represent the awards won by his other casinos. Obviously none of this will be easy.<br/><br/>This is a decent enough conclusion to the Ocean's trilogy; I liked the fact that it went back to its roots in Las Vegas without becoming a remake of the original film. The plot is obviously very far-fetched but that isn't really a problem if you can suspend your disbelief. There are plenty of good laughs, most notably their efforts to make sure the casino doesn't win the Five Diamonds by tormenting the reviewer and the way the man responsible for infiltrating the factory that makes the dice for the casino to rig them starts a strike over workers' pay, nearly spoiling the gang's plans. There are moments of tension as the plan moves into operation although I doubt many viewers will think they might ultimately fail. Most of the regular cast make a welcome return although Julia Roberts is missing, which was a pity. Al Pacino is suitably unpleasant as Willy Banks; a character it is easy to dislike. Overall I'd say this wasn't quite as good as 'Eleven' but it was a definite step up from 'Twelve'; definitely worth watching if you enjoyed the first film."

The actors spend literally 40% of the movie on screen talking about hacking computers and missions that they plan to accomplish to destroy the casino, but due to the heavy ""heist speak"" I had no idea what any of the significance was throughout a large portion of the movie. The ending was also not clever and un-eventful. Of course they'll ruin Al Pacino's casino, but the way they do it could've been a whole lot more interesting. This is just a supreme disappointment.

","It's been about 48 hours now since I saw ""Ocean's Thirteen."" I saw it with a group of people (the only way to see a movie), and the movie took so long to get going, I really got the impression that my friends were hating it. The theater didn't laugh very often, I laughed less, and when the lights came up, my friends told me what a good movie it was. ""Definitely better than the second,"" they said.<br/><br/>I disagreed, but it took me a while to figure out why. ""O13"" isn't bad, per se, and I didn't really hate it while I was watching it, though it did take a while for it to get going. I think, ultimately, the reason the first movie was so good, was because it was fun, funny, and witty, but still knew the difference between ""when to be funny"" and ""when to not be funny."" Andy Garcia's character was dangerous, and treated as such. The situations were potentially dangerous, and you got the sense of real peril for the characters. You knew what was at stake. It was a real movie, and just as good on repeat viewings, due to a really original and fresh approach (as well as some great one-liners).<br/><br/>The second movie wasn't reviewed nearly as well, and having watched it again since, it's really not bad either, except for the huge and sudden changes in tone throughout, as well as the fact that it pulls the last 10 minutes out of its rear end. It was originally written as a different movie, then re-tooled for the ""Ocean's"" cast, and you can kinda tell; it's darker, tries to be more clever than it actually is, and as a result, is a lot less fun.<br/><br/>Whatever strengths the first two movies may or may not have had, the third is lacking them all, except the actors. Everyone from Clooney on down, including Pacino, Vincent Cassel and Eddie Izzard, all bring their A-game, and are pleasant to watch. But the plot is minimal; whether there was a screenplay or not (and there was, from the writers of ""Rounders""), you still get the impression that this is just an excuse for buddies to hang out in Vegas and shoot a movie, a la ""Blue in the Face"" back in the mid-1990's. No one has to do any heavy lifting, and the only actors who even try are the bickering brothers of Casey Affleck and Scott Caan, and of course Pacino, though he could be phoning it in too, and you'd never know it.<br/><br/>Whether you're a movie fanatic or not, the three films can still be summed up by their opening shots. In the first film, cut to: a chair. Clooney sits down in it. The movie itself is really about him, and what makes his Danny Ocean tick, not just before, but during, and after the action. In the second film, cut to: a magnifying glass. Brad Pitt walks into a room, and the next 100 minutes is a closer look at Rusty's life and his relationship with the woman he wakes up in that first scene. Third film? Cut to: a toy store. Yeah, that sounds about right. Soderbergh ain't so dumb."

Flabby and self-indulgent. It is supposed to be a heist movie but the tension is never effectively developed. You get the impression that Clooney and his mates enjoyed the last one and decided to get together again in Vegas and knock out a movie while they were there. The cast seem to be enjoying themselves while forgetting the basics of movie making i.e. entertaining the audience. The pace sags in places and you never really get involved in the story. Elliot Gould and Ellen Barkin are good in their roles but that is not enough to carry the movie. Maybe Hollywood has forgotten how to make an effective comedy/thriller?

","When I visited the Warner Studios in Los Angeles last year, my family and me had a tour; the guide was explaining to us that most of the stages, at that time, were being used for the movie ""Ocean's 13"". I recognized the Bank Casino in the film; I saw it when they were constructing it. My point is that if they were using all these stages for one movie, it involved big money, big production. Was all of this money unnecessarily spent? No, because they're getting it back with interests.<br/><br/>However, ""Ocean's 13"" is, by all means, an unnecessary film. We keep getting all these sequels (there are more coming, don't count them) and it's hard to see one doing things right. At least this Ocean travesty is not the embarrassment that was ""Mission Impossible 3"", but it's too much for Soderbergh, Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the guys; they've taken it too far.<br/><br/>I invited a friend to watch the film and he said he didn't want to because he hadn't seen the first two. Well, you don't really need to watch the first two installments to watch this one, if you date to plan to. You see? The only connection between the three pictures is the cast, the director and David Holmes' entertaining and very loud score. The three films were written by different people and involve one or more big heists that develop throughout the piece; you don't need to be a genius to write something funny and the effort is less if persons like a relaxed Clooney, Pitt and Pacino (what a waste) are saying your lines. <br/><br/>The formula worked well in the first two movies. A lot of people didn't like ""Ocean's 12"" because they said it didn't take itself seriously, and because it used Julia Roberts as herself for a very funny scene. The truth is that ""Ocean's 11"" didn't take itself seriously either; it was just Soberbergh and his actors having fun. And the fact that they wanted to travel to Europe and that they invented a plot line to pull the second film off there is so joyful; because cinema can be about having fun and that's the formula these guys chose: slick fun.<br/><br/>But when ""Ocean's 13"" begins, you can sense something's missing; it's the fun. Maybe it's because the script takes itself too seriously, maybe because it tries to be funny at the same time, or because the actors are not feeling their characters any longer. Maybe the whole movie takes itself seriously (which I doubt), but that naturalness and coziness I mentioned is gone; and the film just doesn't flow.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Soderbergh's camera is still a highlight, filling the piece with complex and riveting shots, and the old pros Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould have a blast; but Casey Affleck's Spanish speaking and an entire Mexican plot line is completely out of place. Let's just hope the honorable Soderbergh doesn't get the team back for a fourth round: it's not working anymore.<br/><br/>One more thing: there's a character played by David Paymer...It must be one of the most unfortunate characters in movie history...Watch and tell me if I'm wrong."

There was no tempo, no pace- and, oh yeah, no plot. Actually, 11 didn't have much of a plot either, but the perfect tempo and witty humor dazzled you so much that you didn't even notice. In 13, the most exciting thing is a fake nose. I personally think it's a travesty to have Al Pacino in a movie- Al Pacino!- and give him about 2 lines, and bad ones at that. There was almost none of 11's humor. 12, while confusing and generally bad, at least was mildly interesting, if only because most viewers spent the whole time trying to figure out what the heck was going on.

","...but I loved this movie. So take it from me. Being that I wasn't a fan of the previous two movies, I was mainly wanted to see it because Al Pacino's in the cast. Well, as usual, Al gives a fine performance, but that wasn't the main reason I liked it. I don't know what this film has that the other films lacked, but it just clicked for me. The story was tight, the gags worked, I loved the fast-paced, quick-witted dialogue (the characters speak like those out of a 1950's movie), and there were only a few dull moments. This time I actually found myself cheering for the guys to pull off the heist. Everyone in the cast gave it their all, never upstaging one another. Maybe part of what worked was the absence of dull subplots. I didn't care much for the relationship between George Clooney and Julia Roberts in the original film. This film mainly focuses on the big score. So go see the film! It's a great popcorn flick that never drags. It's all you can ask out of a summer blockbuster."

","After the disastrous ""Ocean's Twelve"" was released in 2004, I ended my review by asking, ""We've already had this saga sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?"" Well, at long last that question has been answered, and it has come in the form of a good news/bad news proposition. The good news is that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" marks at least a slight improvement over the previous installment (but then again that's not a particularly high bar to jump over). The bad news is that it is ONLY a slight improvement.<br/><br/>For this latest entry in the series (which began, it is easy to forget, with the genuinely entertaining ""Ocean's Eleven"" in 2001), writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and director Steven Soderbergh have at least had the wisdom to return the boys back to Las Vegas, not traipsing all over Europe on what seemed like a high-cost junket for a bunch of already overpaid actors. In ""Thirteen,"" Danny Ocean and his ""crew"" of con artist buddies rally behind the ailing Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), who has just been cheated out of his portion of a brand new casino by his unscrupulous partner, the allegorically named Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who wants the business all to himself. The plan is to sabotage Bank's place so it will go belly-up even before it officially opens.<br/><br/>At the beginning, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" seems like it might turn out to be a fairly decent caper movie, but after about the first half hour or so, a noticeable fatigue and lethargy begin to creep into both the writing and the performances. Very quickly, the plot runs out of steam and we come to sense that the all-star players - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner et. al.- are merely going through the motions, hanging around just long enough to cash their hefty paychecks before heading off to worthier, more artistically rewarding endeavors. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Cheadle, in particular, have been striking out on such interesting career paths of late, that, perhaps, their hearts just aren't in this saga much anymore. And without their acting like it matters, it makes it hard for us in the audience to feel that any of it matters either.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Thirteen"" may be better than ""Ocean's Twelve,"" but it's still a largely half-hearted effort that does little to burnish the reputation of the original movie. I think it's long past time to float this series out to sea so that its fine actors can continue pursuing more worthwhile projects. We would all benefit from a win-win proposition like that."

","Its time now to end the series NOW before it causes any more embarrassment. Even an entire troupe of stars cannot save a movie if it lacks a soul.<br/><br/>Oceans 13 is all about a star studded cast doing their own thing. Not one manages to create a connection with the audience. Even the great Al Pacino has his limitations when the script does not allow any scope for character development. <br/><br/>This time around the pack wants to settle the score with sly and hardboiled Willie Bank (Al Pacino) for duping their colleague Reuben (Elliot Gould). The plan is simple. Willie Bank has to go bankrupt on the opening night of his casino. <br/><br/>To narrate how they go about it, the movie drags through the first half, and then drags some more during the second. There are just too many characters around and many more angles to think your way through.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 6/10 just for giving the audience the likes of Pacino, Clooney, Pitt, Matt, Don Cheadle and Garcia to feast their eyes upon.<br/><br/>Chill out on your bean bag and wait for the DVD release to watch this flick.

It would have made for a better plot if some of the characters had really been interested in her, and distracted from their scam. No character development. Cartoonish stock characterizations used very little of the cast member's tremendous charm and wit. Plot was predictable stock with no cleverness or surprises.

When I can't figure out what a movie is about, then there is a problem. Maybe it's my problem, maybe it's the movie's. But that the question is even asked means that something is wrong because when a movie is good, the question NEVER comes up. This movie has to be one of the more mindless, pointless products from the Hollywood potboiler production factory. The movie tries to be sophisticated, the movie tries to be funny, but all it does is generate that short yet poignant question: SO WHAT? A bunch of guys trying to rob a Las Vegas casino, going through gyrations that are so disjointed and confusing that it defies all logic. What WAS good about this movie, however, were the performances of David Paymer and Ellen Barkin. Both demonstrated a level of comic acting that is responsible for whatever humor this movie was capable of generating. Ms. Barkin definitely has what it takes to be a wonderful comic actress and Mr. Paymer definitely should have a sitcom of his own. As for the other characters, let is be, as the song says. Go on to other projects, do other roles, may your careers prosper but please, OH PLEASE, DO NOT return to Las Vegas, except as a paying guest, because you'll just confuse the audience some more and probably put the audience to sleep, or cause them to ask questions."

I've never been a fan of the Ocean's trilogy, and probably never will. This film and its predecessors may have very famous and lovable actors in them, but this definitely isn't their best. I'm afraid I was counting the seconds until it was over and regretted spending the money for it. This doesn't usually happen to me because I love films and always try to see the best in them.

Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and the Asian guy (whose name, regrettably, I don't remember) in a much appreciated somewhat expanded role, among others, all shine in their performances. I liked watching these GUYS on screen in concentrated form. David Paymer as the long suffering hotel reviewer gets the Best Actor award for this film. He's very good and fun to watch whenever he's on screen. There was a noticeable lack of a strong female presence. Weakest links...Pacino, doing his same old Al Pacino thing in a really bad toupee, Garcia, paunchy acting, paunchy looking, and especially Ellen Barkin whose performance seemed stilted and wooden. Guess she needs to get some remediation at Lee Strasburg's since she's been out of it for so long. Additionally, some of the camera angles employed in her scenes make her look very old, and there are a couple of shots where her breasts look like coconut halves glued to her chest. I enjoy Bernie Mac's presence and expressiveness, but will someone please get him a gift certificate for elocution lessons for Christmas? I can understand only about half of what he's saying when he speaks. <br/><br/>The plot development was pretty good and, as in the previous two installments, I enjoyed seeing the plan come together. I thought, however, that the initial premise for the heist was a bit weak...poor, poor Elliot...but how could he NOT see that coming ?! I tried to forget that the Chunnel drills were left at the bottom of the English Channel, since they CAN'T go backwards or be retrieved after the job was completed. The strike at the dice factory was fun to watch unfold and the monetary resolution made me laugh out loud. And just HOW long will Barkin and Damon sip wine before finally 'gettin' down to binness'? The movie's very glitzy and Vegas-y and made me think that I'd like to visit Vegas again after not having been there since all those renovations have taken place, about 14 years.<br/><br/>The main objection I have is the cost of the experience. $8.50 to get in, $5. for a SMALL popcorn, I brought my own bottle of water....$13.50 total!!!

","We pay eight dollars not to ""watch"" the movie but to feel like we're in the movie. Through screen writing and cinematography, the audience is supposed to see the world through the eyes of the main character and experience his adventures vicariously. Ocean's Thirteen didn't let us in to Danny Ocean's world. The audience was left out of the jokes--when the Chinese character spoke in Chinese, the other characters would talk back or laugh, but since there were no subtitles, the audience didn't know what he was talking about. We were also left out of the lingo (a Susan B. Anthony) and the plotting of the operation. The entire movie was what Alfred Hitchcock would call a McGuffin. <br/><br/>The final goodbye scene between Danny and Rusty at the airport was a two-shot from a low angle in front, so that rather than being physically in the place of the characters looking at each other (in traditional POV style shots), the audience is in the point of view of Danny's luggage. <br/><br/>And why hire the sexiest man alive to co-star in a movie with the second sexiest man alive if there aren't any female characters, no seduction, no love. The girlfriends back home are mentioned in passing, but we never learn anything about them. Seduction is what makes us care about the characters. We fall in love with them when they fall in love with each other. Ellen Barkin looked fantastic in this movie, but rather than seduce her with some of the available male beauty in the movie, Matt Damon's character wears a hideous rubber nose and requires a chemical agent to attract her.<br/><br/>Ocean's Thirteen was a spectacle not a movie."

The plot is so lame and the acting is so uninspired that I kept asking myself, why is it that Ellen Barkin's supposedly high-flying character only owns a single cocktail dress? ""Ocean's 13"" is beyond saving, even from Al Pacino and his self-travesty as gambling mogul Willy Bank. I expected a guest appearance, but in fact his is a surprisingly big part. Not that it helps. The only thing there seems to have been no lack of is spray-on tan, seen on virtually all actors. Also, wouldn't you agree a deliberately shallow movie at least needs a hot chick?

","***The review may contain spoiler***<br/><br/>Hollywood has this tendency to overstuff you with the same delicacies until you had had enough and ready to throw up. Sometimes back, it was the graphically gory films, Apocalypto, 300, The Hills Have Eyes. Then came the avalanche of sequels, 'threequels,' as they are popularly called, Spider-Man, Pirates of the Caribbean, Shrek, all showing up for the third time around Ocean's Thirteen is the part of the same group. Steven Soderbergh's latest is probably the archetype of this whole 'threequel' thingy. For, the current film exits just for the heck of it, just because, the earlier two raked good moolah, the actors concerned agreed to do another film, and the producers had money flowing to back the project. After all, the film boasts of some of Hollywood's best looking men, Don Cheadle included! Other things, story or screenplay are just incidental. Soderbergh is the master of the art. No doubt about it. And the film works solely for this reason, George Clooney, at al notwithstanding. The original Ocean's Eleven is a 1960 heist film directed by Lewis Milestone starring Frank Sinatra as Danny Ocean. Soderbergh's 2001 film was a remake; the way the 2003 film The Italian Job was the remake of the 1969 movie. Then something happened. Its box office success warranted that a sequel should be made. In 2004, people paid for Ocean's Twelve as well. Hence, here's the 'threequel.' The common thread between Eleven and Twelve, was Andy Garcia. Ocean's band steals money from him in the first one and struggles to return it in the next. This time too, Garcia lurks around, but not as an adversary, but as an accomplice. In one sense he's number thirteen in Ocean's band of smart and handsome conmen. The adversary this time is Willie Bank (Al Pacino), an hotelier, one of the richest men in Las Vegas. Pacino provides a dignity to the role which otherwise would have appeared improbable in an already childish plot line. To say the plot is childish may be little harsh, but how do you appreciate a heist drama without the sophistication its demands. What the film lacks, desperately, is innovation. There's no nail biting, 'what will happen next' sequences. Everything happens too smoothly, to believe. First improbability, why would one of Ocean's original eleven would go to work for hated Mr Bank? But Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) does, and ends up in the hospital after a heart attack. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) comes to cheer his old buddy up with his friends Rusty (Brad Pitt), Linus (Matt Damon), Basher (Don Cheadle) and others and decides to bring Bank down. You see revenge is a funny thing, and interesting than a simple heist job. So they plan to make Bank bankrupt on the day his new casino opens. And they do it, all too easily. Phew! Why then, all this hullabaloo? The film scores on production design. It's sleek, very posh, with the beautiful Las Vegas location giving ample support. And it's filled with beautiful people, including two of the sexiest men alive, and with Clooney and his band having a ball. They are all friends in real life, and this shows on the screen. And when it's all over you are treated with a Frank Sinatra song. After all, he was the original Ocean!"

Then we watch for two hours a tedious succession of the several actions of the preparation and carrying out of the sabotage plan most of them quite unplausible and not well explained. For instance the drugging and seduction of the swindler's right-hand lady by a young member of the gang leading her to take him to the secluded room where the diamonds the gang must steal are stored, is plainly ludicrous and unbelievable.

I was a bit upset when I learned Soderbergh would make the sequel from lesser money which just sounds unfair. It's like you went to a good restaurant, gave a generous tip, even brought some friends next time just to find less on your plate. <br/><br/>Because (normally) money shows! <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I don't have anything against low budget. But a budget-cut sequel to a blockbuster sounds just fishy, without mentioning the extra aces like Zeta Jones, Cassel or the European locations. And if I'm wrong here, and they actually made it out of more money, it must have been used up for the above-mentioned stars and locations, for there were big, yawning gaps where some action should have been. R.I.P.<br/><br/>All right, you could think, now they're teaming up again to make up for it. Back to base, back to Vegas, back to the original"". Think again! This is just another desperate grip on the cow's tits which was killed with O12, so they shouldn't try to milk it again. Desperate it is, really. Remember the scene from 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' where Gus was counting money as Damon and Affleck lined up to serve a second helping, before they look frankly in the camera and say something about taking a role sometimes for a friend... I guess this was the case here. Meet up, dress up smart, talk smooth and let the camera roll. <br/><br/><ul><li>Cut. -Are we done yet? - How's Angelina? - Grand.</li></ul><br/><br/>(Why 5 stars then?

Its location changed from across from the Mirage (pay attention to the scene with Pacino and Gould at the construction site), to just south of Paris, to another location that looked like it was next to the Mandalay Bay (overhead shot). Weird. Maybe if I didn't live in Las Vegas, this wouldn't have bothered me. I have never seen Al Pacino play such a chump either. Kinda of a strange character. The most powerful man in Vegas, getting duped non-stop throughout the movie. Not very realistic. But, that goes with the rest of the movie. How about bringing in the two drilling rigs that carved out the tunnel under the English Channel between England and France? Amazing. Just flew them in, I guess.

This is two hours of tedious consciousness I could have avoided otherwise! But here's the important parts broken down, and why they didn't work at all.<br/><br/>Exposition. Endless chatter between the characters about what they are going to do. This important screen-time far outweighs the actual doing of the plan. I reckon by a factor of at least three times. It wouldn't be so bad, but with that much laying out of the story, you'd expect by the time they get on with the job that you'd have a really firm grasp of what was going on.....but in reality, there are still many ""huh?"" moments that leave you playing catch-up with the events.<br/><br/>Fun.

I think I chuckled a couple of times....no laughs, no guffaws, just a couple of snorts of pseudo-laughter.<br/><br/>Action. Well, the CGI was minimal, thankfully, but so was the action. A bit of pretend elevator shaft acrobatics was all we got and that was as ridiculous as it was unconvincing.

The stupidest part was the effort they went to in order to get loaded dice. Who would have believed the top casinos in the world got their dice from a tiny plastics firm from Craphole, Mexico? And as for using the Channel Tunnel excavators to cause earth tremors.....don't even get me started. This is mustachio-twirling villain territory!<br/><br/>Actors. Well some of them at least tried to have fun. Matt Damon with his ludicrous fake nose, for instance. But for the most part, the feeling they all gave off was....""We have to do this, so let's just get on with it and get it over with as quickly as possible"". No real passion, not even much in the way of over-acting. Just formulaic stuff as dull as the movie.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: 90 minutes of men chattering at one another and 20 minutes of pretend excitement. Do yourself a favor.....fast forward the first hour at least and some enjoyment might be derived from this dull film."

The jokes were funny, everyone was handsome, blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>but where was the plot? I must have seen a different cut than all of the sycophants rabidly howling how this movie is the second coming. It seemed like one long 2 hour inside joke. The special effects were great and all that, but really, the whole thing seemed rushed. The set up happens and then the rest of the movie is action.<br/><br/>Spoiler ahead: For example. Was it not just a bit contrived that there should be a huge tunnel digging machine that just happened to be digging a tunnel under the very casino they were going to hit? And when it broke, thy got ANOTHER ONE in 3 minutes? And no one seemed to notice this? I have lived in Las Vegas and you just don't fly a 300 ton tunnel-making machine into McCarren (airport) and the city officials don't blink an eye, much less it not making the news, Al Pacino being informed by any of HIS (casino oriented) sycophants.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. I will probably go spend another $12 to see it a second time to see if it makes any more sense, but it just comes across as far too rushed and convenient.

This he takes as a challenge  because we as audience are made to believe that doing that robbery is impossible. But the way Danny and his gang go about planning the robbery is simply amazing.<br/><br/>To me all the Ocean's movies themes (as they are presented) looks like as easy as getting down from a tram and leisurely walking to my home, opening the house with the key, and taking money out and waving at my own self as I walk out of my home.<br/><br/>I know that there are die-hard fans of Ocean's series, and for them this movie would be really funny, witty, intelligent, and thriller series they can't miss. But for me  it is so degrading to the sensibilities, that I find C -grade (I won't even mention B grade here) Bollywood movie a bit better than this lousy crap. At least C grade third rate Bollywood movies at times think that their audience is a bit intelligent. But not Ocean's series! The biggest joker of the lot was poor Al Pacino  the owner of the casino, running haywire, from one place to another  managing his biggest casino empire. Did not he hire any qualified and professional staff to work in his casino? Less said the better. Waste of money, and talent of great star-cast. Steven Soderbergh, what has happened to you? You gave us a below standard The Good German recently and now this.

However, it never really felt like it got going.<br/><br/>Ocean's 11 was simple idea - steal money from a vault in a complex way. Ocean's 13 was similar in that its back in Vegas, they're stealing money but this time the stakes are higher with revenge on the cards.<br/><br/>Spoilers However, despite it having this stronger motive, you never really felt that everyone was really up for it. The plan has too many aspects to it (the fixed tables, the jewels, the reviewer, Andy Garcia, the earthquake, the Mexican factory) and so lacks focus and a really good pay off.<br/><br/>As for Garcia, he's barely in it. I'm not sure why the felt they could write Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones out in one line but have to keep Garcia in (answer: money).<br/><br/>However, apart from its faults, it was better than 12, but not as good as 11.

Looking in at the entire scheme of things, their were a lot of little mini-jobs the crew had to pull off to make the whole thing work, and it was very fun watching them do it.<br/><br/>Granted the script was globe-trotting a bit and did have some minor plot ""incontinuites"" but any simpleton should be able to decipher it and appreciate it. All the humorous inside jokes and funny one-liners are back to. The Cinematography was elegant and the music (composed by David Holmes) was second to none and blended nicely with the films late 60s early 70s motif.<br/><br/>I for one loved Ocean's Eleven and really liked Ocean's Twelve (believe it or not).

","Much can be said regarding the problems with the two Ocean's sequels. They are gratuitous, seeking to indulge viewers in the personality traits and in-jokes we found charming in the first film, but which have now become overdone and drag down the films' humor. Premises and plot lines have become bloated and ever more unbelievable, crammed so full of twists and intricacies that any given detail is under-explained to the point of confusion.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, Ocean's Thirteen is better than Twelve in all these respects. However, this one sinks to a new low: our heroes drug a woman (with pheromones) so she will engage in sexual activity with one the operatives and bring him into a private area where he can pull off a heist.<br/><br/>In other words, producers hired just one woman actor--so that they could write a sexual assault plot about her. Be better, Hollywood."
"eric262003","8","2","3","23 February 2009"," Who Say The Number 13 Has to be Bad
","After many disappointing threequels, this one does represent that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" third entry to the series is a charm. It great to see Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his posse back in the action for another robbery, only this time it's much more personal over casual. Al Pacino stars as Willy Bank, a powerful Las Vegas casino owner who partners up with Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould)to build a new new casino, but heads start to turn as Bank betrays Tishkoff and throws him of the partnership leaving him with absolutely nothing. After a series of verbal squabbling, Bank tells Tishkoff to ""go screw yourself."" This leads Mr. Ocean and his gang to bring down Bank for what he did in what is to be the ultimate heist for Ocean and the gang. <br/><br/>Members of the gang including Basher (Don Chedle) and the Malloy Brothers (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan) would rather have Bank's head on a silver platter. But that would be too easy for Ocean's gang and not much fun either. Instead they've plotted to get back at Bank and his Casino by toiling with the games so that one one wins in his casino and eventually will leave Bank bankrupt (no pun intended). Though the plan looks fun and easy, there is a slight burden to this diabolical plan. A security device called ""The Greco"" can spot gamblers if they're rigging the casino. This device can track a person's heartbeat or other quirky affliction to determine whether the gambling is done legally or illegally. So seemingly impossible to take down, the Greco, Ocean needs plenty of resources and hordes of cash in order to achieve this impossible mission to take down this security device. Fellow Ocean member Linus Caldwell (Matt Domon), suggests to Ocean to ask an old nemesis from the past, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to put their differences in the past and to back them up financially.<br/><br/>This is a pivotal and remarkable addition to the series that every fan of the series will get a kick out of. People were very upset about the previous outing ""Ocean's Twelve"" mainly because it wasn't intended to a sequel to it's predecessor ""Ocean's Eleven"". Here it revitalizes what made the ""Ocean Eleven"" a classic. Twelve is an even balance between Eleven and Thirteen, with ""Ocean's Thirteen"" being by far the best of the series. It certainly interesting that director Steven Soderbergh has created a movie where we're able to sympathize with con artists, making casino bosses, as evil villains with their mind set on power and corruption. <br/><br/>Another reason why this addition stands out is the performance of Al Pacino. When was this guy ever in a bad movie? His character depths have always stood the test of time and in ""Ocean's Thirteen"" it's no exception. Chalk up another great portrayal for Pacino who if it were another actor, the role of Willy Bank would've been clichéd, but Pacino made sure that wasn't the case. Whether he's playing good guys or evil-doers you can always depend on Al Pacino to make every movie he's in all the more riveting."

","When I went to see Ocean's 12 I was expecting a heist film, but in the end we realize there really is no heist at all (depending on how you look at it). In the words of Eli Roth, ""the only heist in Ocean's 12 was that the film robbed us of our money."" It's true, because all the prep work for the heist in Ocean's 12 was negated by its ending. As if wasting people's time and money with Ocean's 12 wasn't enough for them, Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the gang are back for another crack at the Ocean's films.<br/><br/>Willie Banks (Al Pacino) has swindled Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) out of 4 acres of prime real estate, not to mention the rights to the newly built super casino that they co-financed. The casino project was a huge gamble for Reuben, and as a result of the betrayal, Reuben suffers a stroke Needless to say, this spurs the Ocean's crew into action. They don't care if they win, they just want Banks to lose and lose big. The movie really has no heist; again, it depends on how you look at things. This is much more of a revenge story than anything else.<br/><br/>Can you really even call this one a heist? Making a casino lose is no easy task, but in Ocean's 13, it seems anyone with a little know-how and a little luck can take out Banks casino. As they go around planning and preparing for the big night which will put Banks out of business, a million and one things fall into place without the crew even trying. The only thing standing in their way is the Greco; an impenetrable, unstoppable super computer that can detect a real win from an expected one.<br/><br/>The set-up for the heist is basically a series of excuses to tell jokes about what may or may not be happening in each actor's real life, none of which are even that funny. I still can't figure out how Danny Ocean's crew knew ahead of time about Tulour? They just chalk it up to ""We were watching him the whole time."" Well what made it so obvious? The movie was so stale, so dry; I walked out of the movie theatre wondering why I was so heavily invested in this film and its characters in the first place. But I know why; because it's Matt Damon, George Clooney, Brad Pitt in one more over hyped and over publicized, utterly predictable crap fest designed to give the public some cheap laughs and take our money.<br/><br/>This film might have been a bit more entertaining if the pacing had been better. But faster pacing wouldn't have completely saved this one; far from it. No matter how much you polish it, you simply cannot turn poop into gold. Clooney has gone on record and said that this was his last Ocean's film. So if the new head of the gang is Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), let's hope the writer and director can pump some new blood (and life) into Ryan's 11."

They seemed to sleepwalk thru their lines. There did not seem to be the chemistry that was in the previous movies. The only actor to put out some effort was Pacino. Ellen Barken was fun to watch. The phermone patch was sooooo hokey. In the previous movies at least there wasn't anything that stood out as total BS the way this one did. This wasn't a SciFi movie. Were the writers so brain dead they couldn't find another way to get to Barkin? The entire heist plan seemed contrived. This just seemed to be another average Heist movie.

Many mysteries remain for me - who kept calling Brad Pitt? What did he and Clooney keep talking about? What exactly was Matt Damon doing in the film? I only realized just now that the villainous guy who double crossed Eliot Gould was Al Pacino! So Al acted well enough to camouflage his usual persona. That is a plus.<br/><br/>The software guy first went on and on about how the system was unbreakable then Bingo he had a way to break it! The other cast - who knows what they were doing - some guy used to keep dealing cards and getting them all over the floor.<br/><br/>I have to say that star power is an awesome thing - even with complete lack of coherence and intelligence in how the plot was cobbled together every time I woke up either Matt or Clooney or Brad kept my eyes glued to the screen for a few minutes before the snoozies set in.

","At the heart of this film is a robbery that is just too easy to carry out but nets huge proceeds - and that just about describes the movie itself. ""Ocean's 12"" was so disappointing that it did not merit a sequel, but clearly the franchise was just so profitable that nobody could resist the temptation to milk the audience one more time.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Ocean's 13"" is not as bad as ""Ocean's 12"" with a much simpler - arguably too simple - plot, but it is nowhere near as good as ""Ocean's 11"".<br/><br/>It is such a lazy work: the same director and the same stars back in the original location have just spun the wheel one more time with no thought for more characterisation or some originality. The main stars, George Clonney and Brad Pitt, are more than pretty faces, as we saw in ""Syriana"" and ""Babel"" respectively, and Al Pacino and Andy Garcia are sadly underused, with even the one female character Ellen Barkin utterly wasted.<br/><br/>Yet, as before, Steven Soderbergh keeps things moving along and gives us plenty of flashy scenery and camera-work, so many viewers will not notice that they've been mugged."

This time, it is not for the money or the girl, but for vengeance.<br/><br/>Their next victim is an ego driven hotel manager Willy Banks (Al Pacino). When one of Ocean's eleven players, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), decides to do business with Banks, he cuts him out of a heavy deal, which lands Reuben in the hospital from a sudden heart attack. So the players join together to rebuild Reuben's share of the hotel with what they know besta multimillion dollar theft from Bank's hotel.<br/><br/>Once again, it is the ""nice guys"" against the ""mean guys"". I wouldn't call it ""good guys"" vs. ""bad guys"" because Ocean and his players are thieves, but they are pleasant people. Helping out a friend is not a common characteristic of a normal thief, and besides, they're charming, hysterical, and handsome fellows.<br/><br/>Watching Ocean and all his players again on the big screen was a hearty joy. Observing their various schemes and how they pull off the heist was very entertaining, making a satisfying two hour film go by quickly. The momentary moments of Andy Garcia on the screen as Mr. Benedict were also fun. Although, a new light of Al Pacino as Banks was shown on the screen as a ruthless and heartless ""butthead"" surprised me. Perhaps I haven't seen enough movies of Al. He was still excellent as he always is in his roles.<br/><br/>However, I missed the appearances of Julie Roberts as Tess, and Catherine Zeta-Jones from ""Ocean's Twelve"" as Isabel. It was all the guys this time. And there was one thing that bothered me at the end of the film.<br/><br/>After their victory, all of them pulled out cigars and puffed away. Okay, I know having a cigar after doing a deal is a common thing that guys do, but why glamorize it, especially in theaters, which can promote youths to smoking? Which is even worse is the fact that after Reuben recovered from his heart attack; he too was puffing away with them, as if saying ""Okay, give me another heart attack."" That's a slap in the face to the cardiologist! Cigarettes maybe banned from commercial advertisement, but having movies, like this restarts, this advertisement showing cool guys puffing away.

There is no suspense, no humor, no intelligence. Actually the only positive thing I can think about this movie is that it is glamorous and that is all. However, since glamor is not the first thing I look in a movie, I can honestly say that this film was a disappointment. First of all I got the impression that nothing happened in this movie. When comparing this movie to Ocean's 11 you will find that in Ocean's 13 there is no excitement, no climax and no humor. But the most annoying thing for me was that the plan of the heist was rubbish and full of not believable details. This just spoils the fun. It seems to me that the writers could not think of an intelligent plan and just made up a lot of things that just are not possible. This usually does not bother me in a film, but when you are watching a film about a heist you want it to be believable, you want to place yourself in the shoes of the con men and think that maybe this could be done.

Quite honestly, there's no way any of this could have been pulled off for real, so your best bet is to sit back and enjoy the glitz and glitter of Las Vegas and witness the impossible. The players this time around weren't in it so much for the money, but to help out fellow member Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) who got screwed out of his share of the new Bank Casino by insidious owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino). With honor among thieves, the Ocean crew set about their task with multiple complications intruding on their original plan.<br/><br/>Not only do we have most of the original cast back, but Danny (George Clooney) and the boys find themselves in a tough financial spot, so upon the advice of Linus (Matt Damon), they have to resort to the unthinkable. They approach former target Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) for a hefty thirty six million advance, having to settle for a double payback and a wrinkle involving the theft of Bank's 'Five Star Diamond' collection. That in turn sets up the return of master thief Francois Toulour (Vincent Cassell), at which point, if you haven't seen the prior film in the series, one would be left pondering who the shady character is. <br/><br/>I have to admit, I was kind of looking for Julia Roberts to show up in the story, even as a late entry, but that never happened. It was cool however how the script matured Matt Damon's character over the course of the three Ocean films to make him more involved in the planning of the heist. His ""see you when I see you"" at the finale left things ripe for yet another sequel, but topping the escapades in this story border on the impossible, so we'll probably have to leave things as they lay. Even so, it was an entertaining run, as long as you don't take things too seriously."

","""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It is entertaining at its core and even goes back to the Vegas locale that made the first one so successful. However, by the end of ""13"" it is clear that the ""Ocean's"" series has played itself out.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt), and the rest of the gang (this time featuring Matt Damon in a much larger role) back in Vegas, where this time they are getting a little revenge on casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) for putting Reuben (Elliot Gould) in the hospital.<br/><br/>The biggest ""plus"" about this film is that it goes back to Vegas, the setting that these kinds of movies need to feature. Even when all else can (and sometimes does) go wrong, there is just something about seeing those suave guys in sharp clothing strutting around the casino floor. It adds that ""cool"" factor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""13"" is kind of a mishmash of all kinds of different stuff, both plot and character- wise. The ""big job"" is delved into much too quickly with very little ""setup"" (a key component of the original), while the characters become (for the first time) little more than parodies of themselves. Everything just kind of feels rushed in this one, as if the plan was to camouflage a fading series with continued action instead of plot/character development.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Ocean's 13"" is still entertaining, at least. If you liked the first two at all you'll have no trouble sitting through this one. However, it won't grab you and take you for a fun ride like the others, either."

","Come on, be honest, you wanted Pacino to win didn't you? I mean, Brad Pitt is good when he's not doing the fluff action movie thing. He can act when he really wants to. Matt Damon is the same, when he wants to act he can act and when he wants a paycheck he does a boring action film. George Clooney is cool, he does some mad roles...<br/><br/>...but, I mean, they are up against Al Pacino. It's hard to hold your own against them man.<br/><br/>Other than that it is leagues better than the second film and still not as good as the first.<br/><br/>The first had some real heart, the third had some great jokes, but you got the feeling that they were grasping at straws. A heist film with that much going on is hard to pull off more than once.<br/><br/>But the effort was here and it was a good job. They did a good fight, they just couldn't pull it off a second time, let alone a third.<br/><br/>I'll give you a hint.

They simply smile and pose. The film is done cleverly and the heist towards the end is well executed and thoughtfully entertaining. There is no nudity or vulgar language.

","The first Ocean's Eleven (the remake, not the Rat Pack version) is a classic heist film. Good team, excellent plot, clever twists, action, excitement, the whole nine yards. Ocean's Twelve, the sequel, is a convoluted mess that is best left forgotten. Ocean's Thirteen, the movie in question, falls somewhere in between. It's a huge leap forward in quality when compared to its immediate predecessor, but it doesn't quite reach the novelty and sheer fun that the first had in spades.<br/><br/>We return to Las Vegas as Reuben (Elliott Gould) has fallen to some hard times, being cheated on a casino deal by heinous Willy Bank (Al Pacino) and now it's up to Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew to settle the score. It's a workable plot, though a touch too similar to the first movie to really impress with its originality. The movies look too similar for you to be able to appreciate it fully, and even the twists are somewhat predictable because of this.<br/><br/>And while the acting is generally very good, I don't really buy Pacino as an effective villain in a heist movie. The man can certainly play a villain, no doubt about it, but he doesn't quite hit the right notes here. Especially when the movie also contains Andy Garcia, the slimy ball of haughtiness from the first film. I also have to note that none of the characters have evolved at all. They're still the same old rogues they were in the first film, and while I don't expect a lot of character development in a cheerful heist film series, I'd appreciate if there was a little bit of it.<br/><br/>All that being said, I do think it's an enjoyable film. The heist itself is a lot of fun, the characters are still delightfully quirky and it seems like the film crew had a lot of fun."

This time they are back in Las Vegas and their motives for this job is different. I liked them being in Vegas instead of France and I liked the job being yet another casino other than a museum.<br/><br/>You'll like Ocean's 13 for the same reasons you liked Ocean's 11, or even 12.

The ridiculously likable crew are back, getting revenge on a businessman (Al Pacino) who conned their friend. It relocates the action back to Vegas, where it belongs, and this time they were polite enough to actually include a heist. Concluding the trilogy in better than expected fashion, O13 restores the trilogy to glamorous, slick, stylish glory and still shines brighter than the majority of the lights on the strip. It doesn't measure up the original. Don Cheadle is as jarring as ever and there are some irritating jokes and the heist sometimes feels lost in the comedy. It can be overly confusing and it's sometimes difficult to understand where the plot is going. These various flaws don't stop it from being a solid 4 star crime flick.<br/><br/>The characters are still entertaining and likable. This time, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are actually likable and aren't just smug. Matt Damon is still bland though. It's well directed by Steven Soderbergh and has another fine musical score. There's also a sense of finality and it wraps up the trilogy very well. It's not as surreally enjoyable as the first one, but it's humorous, slick and offers plenty of the escapist fun that the first did. It doesn't suffer from the laws of diminishing returns and does the formula of the first one without adding to it but also without copying it and doing a turd on it. This isn't the strongest or bravest second sequel out there but it deserves a lot of respect for being entertaining and learning from the mistakes of the awful Ocean's 12. Nothing memorable or daring, but O13 provides plenty of stylish and sub zero cool heist based fun. At least there's a proper heist set piece.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Coming off the muddled misstep of OCEAN'S TWELVE, Soderbergh proves that he can still produce high-quality Hollywood fare when he puts his mind to it. Alleviating most of the problems that plagued the second installment, he uses his star power cast much more efficiently, delivers a scheme that's complex without being confusing, and takes a step back from making the characters superhuman. The glitz and style and polish help make this a very entertaining flick, perhaps the best in the series (though I must confess my memories of the first one are fuzzy). My one beef would be that Danny Ocean has it a little too easy this time, and while I enjoyed his easygoing cleverness, I wished for a few more obstacles in his path. Any snags in the plan are deftly overcome, and Al Pacino's character does not make for an intimidating protagonist. Still a very fun ride, though."

It is the third and final film in the Soderbergh series following the 2004 sequel Ocean's Twelve and the 2001 film Ocean's Eleven, which itself was a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film Ocean's 11.

In betraying Reuben Tishkoff, Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean. Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor.

","This easygoing and lighthearted caper movie is a definite step up on the second in the series – although I hope this marks the end of the trilogy rather than a prelude to any further sequels. It's a film you're going to like if you appreciate the talents of the cast – Clooney, Pitt, Damon et al – all of whom are by now well settled into their sophisticated roles. In fact, THIRTEEN might well have the edge on ELEVEN , as the ingenious plot – detailing an immense and complicated scam on a mega-casino – is so well devised that I had a ball watching it play out.<br/><br/>Of course, there's nothing much here that hasn't been done before, and the film might well be too smart for its own good. Some of the supporting players – Eddie Izzard, Shaobo Qin – are more irritating than amusing, and Al Pacino's repugnant villain is one of the most unpleasant characters he's played in a long career. But there are other highlights that deflect from the flaws – Ellen Barkin's sexy femme fatale (sadly with the distraction of too much collagen, but otherwise perfect), a plethora of cutting-edge technological wizardry, some nicely judged twists and Soderbergh's debonair direction, all of which combine to make this a relaxing and genuinely fun outing for the crew."
"Chance2000esl","5","1","1","26 December 2007"," Highly Watchable Fluff Quickly Forgotten
","This film is not the kind of story I'm interested in (= the interactions among various Las Vegas casino owners), but I was curious as to what a film with so many current 'stars' would be like. I'd planned to turn it off to go to bed, but couldn't stop watching it wondering what was going to happen. Give credit to the film makers for this ""I couldn't take my eyes off it"" quality! <br/><br/>This was due to the fast paced editing; the complicated plans and details in having Danny Ocean's Thirteen simultaneously bankrupt the evil casino owner Willie Banks (Al Pacino) and steal his collection of diamonds; the quick cutting between so many characters and their roles in the plot; and as to whether or not Ellen Barkin was going to take off her clothes.<br/><br/>Finally the caper is pulled off, and as the main characters watch actual fireworks above the towering buildings, we think-- so what? Therein lies the problem. We really don't care about any of these people. <br/><br/>Only Al Pacino gets my sympathy because of his tremendous ability to convey presence in his acting, and Carl Reiner for his practically mini cameo as the reviewer. George Clooney in this movie seems like he's a fugitive runaway host from 'Family Feud,' or 'The Price is Right.' (I applaud his work in 'Fail Safe' (2000), which was done live in television in black and white, and the amazing 'Good Night and Good Luck' (2005) in which he, thankfully, only played a minor role.) This film kind of plays like an ensemble picture, but the ensemble characters interact with each other very little except mostly in pairs or trios.<br/><br/>The absolute fantasy of the caper is certainly appropriate to the fantasy that is Las Vegas itself, and should be viewed as such. It doesn't have to make sense, but just move along quickly and give each of the actors a little screen time.<br/><br/>This is a movie that will join the vast ""Who Cares"" heap of high budget films that twenty years from now will hardly ever be viewed, except to see the Brad Pitt 'walk ons.' I give it a 5."

Maybe I shouldn't have because as far as I am concerned he was the only good thing about it.<br/><br/>All the wit, all the cleverness, all the charm and the great one liners, the excitement, the wonderful, energetic atmosphere....all that is gone. It's like everything that was good about 11 was cut and in it's place the direct opposite was done. Very disappointing. Except of coarse for the exceptional Mr. Pacino who of coarse, is wonderful but I do think he's kind of in the wrong movie. What I didn't like is listed below.<br/><br/>I liked Ocean's 11 because it was a ""caper film""..and an incredibly clever one. What was clever about this? Not much. (And not much ""caper"" either.) Instead we get a series of jokes and pranks, some of them more annoying then funny, a series of short quick scenes(seriously-did any of the scenes last more then a minute?) I was getting a little dizzy with all the quick takes. And the movie drags too. I kept waiting for something to happen(or at least something with more interest then what was happening.) I think the original premise was good but at least make the ""revenge"" story a bit clever or different or INTERESTING. This was ordinary and even a bit below ordinary. In Ocean's 11 we get something incredibly complicated but exciting,with incredible energy. Here we get jokes and tricks and stunts about smells and rashes and a lot of the central plot didn't even make sense. (There is a difference between plot holes in the movie and the movie itself being one long plot hole.)I could go on but why bother? Suffice to say this was not what I expected.<br/><br/>And the absence of Roberts is disappointing as well as the fact that Clooney and Pitt do not even appear to be acting half the time rather then basically playing themselves or just being cute. The whole movie was a letdown.<br/><br/>The positives? Al Pachino, Al Pachino, Al Pachino! It was great seeing him in the flick and whatever else I say about it, seeing Al in it was maybe worth seeing the movie. In fact even though I basically disliked Ocean's 13 intensely it is not unwatchable and maybe major Pachino fans should check it out. But it is nowhere near the level of 11 and I'd rate this a 4 (am giving it an extra point for the Pachino factor.)My vote is 5 of 10."

","Ocean's 13 was pretty much a must-see for me and the girlfriend. So we bought tickets, and settled in.<br/><br/>My response to this movie is lukewarm at best. The crew is losing their touch; it's becoming more of the same. This time it's not even about a heist at all, just payback. Oh wait, there is a heist in there too, a plot device if I ever saw one, just to make the villain(s) of Ocean's 12 look like their pompous arrogant selves again. Basically, it feels like all the scraps left over from the first two movies were put in a big meat grinder which was then subsequently turned on. Like a the real thing, the result is filling for a few moments, but it's not wholesome, and you definitely don't want to know about the ingredients which are in there.<br/><br/>Even though the movie has an underlying plot/storyline, there isn't any sense of build-up or tension. Ocean's crew being Ocean's crew, you know that they are going to get away with it, so no points for originality there. And then it becomes a slow-to-start mixture of somewhat funny situations in which the crew is preparing their 'heist'. The movie felt like it was based on some general ideas on what to do, and that the crew were told to improvise to see what they could make of it. I was somewhat sorry as well as pleased to see Matt Damon's character Linus finally seeing some development: he's no longer the klutz of the group. And that was about the only truly original idea in the movie.<br/><br/>And that is really all there is to it. Therefore I consider Ocean's 13 to be the weakest of the trilogy by far. Granted, it made me smirk, some ideas were funny, but it didn't capture me like 11 and 12 did. Exactly like that sausage: filling, but only for a short while.<br/><br/>Go see it on DVD---it can wait that long. And make sure you see 11 and 12 before it, in that order."

The computer generated shots make it look like a space casino in Star Wars.

Are you going to have me believe that not one, but 2 chunnel digging machines will be available and nobody will notice the friggin digging going on under the damn Vegas strip?!? Heist movies succeed because there is an aire of reality to them. If you start making stuff up that is too outlandish, then the drama of the situation is ruined. It is disappointing that the script writers had to go to such lengths to up themselves...leading to situations that are completely unbelievable. Ellen Barkin looks good, but she is completely wasted. The movie struggles to find stuff for everyone to do...again leading to stupid situations.<br/><br/>My hope would be that the Oceans films continue...but with a more organic script that focuses on creativity and character/situation development. Clooney, Pitt, and Damon et al can carry a movie without all the grand crap that went on in Oceans 13.

Now Al Pacino played as always brilliantly, but that was thanks to his talent, NOT Steven Soderbergs actor directing, because he didn't get anything out of Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon or for that matter the rest of the cast. They didn't tribute with anything besides their smiles, good looks and their presence. The film lacks of feelings, emotions, renewal and charm. All I saw was a scene by scene in an coincidental order trying to tell a story that didn't make sense at all. Every time a new scene played, the audience has to figure out time, place, meaning, character relationships in a matter of seconds, before the film changed scenario again. The audience have to figure out, what happened immediately before the scene, because that is not explained and have to figure out why and how they did so. All very confusing.

","When Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made ""Out to Sea,"" very late in their careers, and not very long before each passed away, it seemed that they were simply performing parts they could have ""phoned-in,"" and perhaps add a few million dollars to their estates. Same for their original ""Grumpy Old Men"" flick, and even more so for its sequel. But a lot of that could be attributed to their ages, and to the fact that they had worked so much together - from earlier days through middle age and into their twilight time.<br/><br/>""Godfather III"" was terrible, despite its two predecessors both winning ""Best Picture"" Oscar. And the recent ""Spiderman,"" ""Shrek"" and ""P.o.C."" flicks certainly have all proved that in sequels, the third time certainly ISN'T the charm.<br/><br/>This movie seals that principle in concrete. With the ever-expanding ensemble cast, it's different from a two-person, buddy/rival offering like Lemmon/Mathau's or a larger, but somewhat-altered cast as in the Godfather movies. All the ""Ocean"" films have included the main group of hunky males and beautiful females, in their primes -- many of whom have been the ""before-the-title"" leads in their own individual work.<br/><br/>The problem is, the premise is exhausted; it's difficult enough to make one good major picture, and seemingly impossible replicate a third time (plus, the second/middle ""Ocean"" was even worse than this one).<br/><br/>But a main complaint, in my opinion, is that despite being younger, with flesh still firm on their faces and mid-sections, and without advancing age providing any excuse --- Clooney, Damon, Pitt, et al, seem to be performing barely a small notch above phoning in these roles, here. And the older Pacino and Gould almost seem to be attempting a parody of the roles they've been assigned, as opposed to straight acting. In terms of the plot, as another person commented here, it seems downright silly that the wise, caper-connected Gould character would be duped by the likes of Pacino's character in this story.<br/><br/>It might rate a 4* or 5* mark only -- I'd give it a 6, simply in view of excellent photography/scenery, and the lavishness of production."

","After the grand heist and goofing off (well, mostly goofing off) in Europe, director Steven Soderbergh and the gang return to Las Vegas to plan yet another scheme of a slick looking production that rings hollow and without much payoff.<br/><br/>Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) friend Reuben (Eliott Gould) suffers a heart attack after getting cut out of a hotel business deal with Willy Banks (Al Pacino), a notorious businessman in Sin City. To get even, Ocean, Rusty (Brad Pitt), Linus (Matt Damon) and the other compadres team up with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to bring down Banks by bankrupting the hotel on its grand opening night.<br/><br/>The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" doesn't boast enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time. The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict supposed to be inherent to the setup. Not every actor's back in cool form, Pacino's character doesn't come off as amusing, and the overall interaction among the characters has become oozing with mere machismo and virtually no zing that all one is really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they actors play themselves out to a climax that this time around isn't as compelling as to be a carelessly made movie's saving grace.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Thirteen"" is a rough, substandard time waster that builds upon a thread towards the payoff, yet not accomplishing anything consequential upon getting there."

I've seen you tube videos better than oceans 12. its hard for me to think up ten lines about how god awful this movie was without using foul language. i just wanted to warn people before they took your money. i threw my DVD in the trash where it belongs. i also threw away oceans 12 which has been collecting dust since the first time i watched it. needless to say if there is a 14 i will boycott it.

And by the time ""Ocean's 88"" comes out all of our brains will have drowned in that particular ocean.<br/><br/>However, if you thought this movie franchise was more pathetic than anything else that is going on around now, think again: the incredibly transparent media hype surrounding O13 is even more pathetic. Almost every day do we get bombarded in the media by various supposedly ""witty"" remarks Clooney or Damon make about each other or other cast members. Clearly, Clooney and gang a sad ""rat pack"" make, so the producers needed to devise an original way of making sure that everyone in the world knew that Clooney and others were ""really cool"". Nevermind the fact that everything is probably scripted (i.e. every ""ever-so-casual"" utterance) or that Clooney is about as ""cool"" as one of his dead pigs, or that Damon and Pitt look like someone put women's faces on male bodies...<br/><br/>I don't think much of the old rat pack either, but even overrated mafia midgets like Sinatra were more interesting than this sorry bunch.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","9 June 2007"," Back to basics, with an assured, relaxing ease
","They've done this twice before. They know you like 11 and they just pretend that you have forgotten 12. With full control at the helm, Soderbergh gives you a pleasant reminiscence of 11, although it does not have the freshness that you can only get the first time around.<br/><br/>The theme is ""relax and enjoy"". Right up front, they give you a simple reason for the heist  getting even for buddy Reuben (the guy who financed ""11"") who has been taken for a ride by unscrupulous partner Willie Bank (Al Pacino) and, as a result, fallen into a coma after a heart attack. Not wanting you to exert your brain too much, the movie makers give you, up front, the three-prong revenge plan. One: at the opening of Bank's new casino and hotel, get it to lose the highest amount possible at various games in 3.5 minutes during which the super surveillance computer is knocked out. Two: steal his favourite, hidden diamonds. Three: give the hotel rating agent such a tortured time that the usual 5-star rating that Bank's hotels invariably gets will plummet to rock bottom. None of this is terribly original. The fun is in the execution.<br/><br/>What comes through very clearly in this movie is the special attention paid to little touches of humanity (compassion, loyalty, friendship etc):<br/><br/><ul><li>such as, Rusty catching Danny's eyes all moist after watching a TV show in which the poor and deprived are helped </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>such as, Yen initially refusing to get into a super dangerous stunt, but cannot resist the trio's (Danny, Rusty, Linus) wickedly clever plead using Reuben's poor helpless conditions (yielding, Yen points a finger to each of them saying ""shit"", ""shit"", ""shit"", and then plunges into the elevator shaft at the risk of having his head chopped off by fast moving elevators) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>such as, the poor guy from the rating agency getting a ""surprise present"" from Rusty after the hell through which they've put him </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>such as, references of good Old Blue Eyes, a handshake with whom is purportedly a most sacred symbol of loyalty</li></ul><br/><br/>The entire gang is back, and you'll love them. The trio is never more at ease, with Cloony and Pitt looking like they are almost ad-libbing and Damon maturing into a niche all of his own. Everybody else has a fair share of screen time. Even Garcia and Cassel (from 12) are back, as Terry Benedict actually finances their project, for a simple reason that he hates Bank's guts. ""Nobody is forever and friend or forever an enemy"" and ""your enemy's enemy is your friend"" never ring so true. Al Pacino of course never disappoints, making here something out of a role that doesn't offer much for him to do. <br/><br/>The movie is by no means great. The pace gets loose, and in not just once place. As mentioned, it does not have the freshness of 11. But you don't want to keep scores. Just sit back and enjoy the party."

","It's third time unlucky, yet again. First Spider-man 3, then Shrek 3, Pirates: End of the World. And now this. <br/><br/>It's not as bad as Ocean's Twelve (but then, what could be?) and Vegas has never looked better. Great cinematography, especially as the plane lands at the airport, with all the hotel resorts visible from the runway.<br/><br/>But it's an awful grind nonetheless. When the two decent gags you've already seen in the trailer, you know you're in trouble. The McGuffin (plot premise) is quite dodgy. With the first, you know it's a) the money and b) Ocean getting Tess (Julia Roberts) back that's the motivator. Like most heist films, much of the fun is the getting together of the gang. It's hard to mess that up, whether it's The Dirty Dozen or The Wild Geese etc.<br/><br/>With Ocean's Twelve, well, er, they had to get the money back for the guy they robbed. Not so thrilling. Spoils the 'happy ever after' finale of the first one.<br/><br/>Here the Elliot Gould character, Reubens, is stiffed by new casino kingpin Al Pacino and has a heart attack. So the rest of the gang decide to take Pacino down to cheer Reubens up. Sounds better than it reads. You think, how could Reubens be so naive as to trust this shark, anyway? He's hung out with crooks, after all. It's all a dodgy premise that you don't believe, nor the whole Mission Impossible routine they go into right away. It's like watching The Krypton Factor and none of that cool David Holmes music can alter that. It's just boring.<br/><br/>Neither Julia Roberts nor Catherine Zeta-Jones reprise their roles, though that may be no bad thing. They're not even referenced by the leads, though. You don't really believe this gang would risk heading for the slammer for decades, estranged from their loved ones, just to generate a pep talk for their ill chum.<br/><br/>Any humour is sort of understated twee and self-regarding. Or just naff. Eddie Izzard shows up again, but oddly he can't really carry a role off like this. He's not larger than life, his voice is too light, he can't measure up to Clooney or Pitt.<br/><br/>There's an awful lot of talk and exposition (which is what the Izzard character is brought in to do, it seems) from start to finish but I couldn't catch a lot of it. I mean, really, you just have to strain a bit to hear the dialogue all the way through. It's off-putting, and it seems to be a trend with modern blockbusters. You almost suspect it's deliberate, to put the audience on tenterhooks.<br/><br/>We're meant to believe the gang can just buy off any minion in Willy Bank's supercasino just like that, bribing them to do stuff whenever it's convenient.<br/><br/>There are one or two flickers on interest during the final heist... and that's it. The finale is a rip-off from the first one, substituting fireworks for the beauty of the Bellagio fountains, and a nondescript Sinatra song for Debussy's lovely Clare da Lune.<br/><br/>The film looks good, and if you're heading to Vegas for the first time, check it out on DVD. But don't spend money going to see it. It's a real grind. Even one hour in I was waiting for it to be over, and thinking, wow, there's another HOUR to go...<br/><br/>Diminishing returns here: after the first big win, we've ploughed money into the box office and got less back for it."

","Oceans Thirteen is the next chapter to the Oceans series which started off with the revived Oceans Eleven, that led to Oceans Twelve. It features a star studded lineup of very famous actors such as George Clooney, the irresistible to women, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, the hilarious Bernie Mac, Al Pacino and Andy Garcia. They star in one of the best films I've watched, 'Oceans Thirteen'. The performances by all the actors is utterly brilliant, I give many credits to the script writers and the actors for doing an astounding performance. The women were left out on this heist, so Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones was replaced by newer actors.<br/><br/>The Plot follows all the normality's of a Hollywood produced film, problems are told in the beginning, they find a way to fix it and they do the plan. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his group who are now nicknamed ""Oceans 13"", plan to rob a 'high rollers' casino which 500 million US is situated! They all play funny and serious characters like Bernie Mac who is a casino game salesman and Brad Pitt who is a Seismologist (think earthquakes). This movie does the heist is funnier than previous Ocean films, but doesn't lose it seriousness. It is set in the worlds stage show, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.<br/><br/>The acting is exceptionally brilliant, the whole cast did an amazing job, exception to Brad Pitt. Pitt still played his lazy way as he does in all the Oceans films. Pitt starts the plans but never has a big part. The smaller, unknown actors do a better job in the movie than Pitt. He does aid to the funniness of this movie. There are also many amazing stunts and acts done to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. Such as the 'grease' mans elevator extravaganza.<br/><br/>They plan an overcomplicated job at robbing the casino, it is an action packed plan with originality and funny remarks throughout the film. They still have a small link back to the original Oceans 11 that had Frank Sinatra in it, by mentioning old schemes in codenames like 'Susan B. Anthony' which gives many of us no clue what they are up to, which gives it a perfect amount of suspense in an action movie. But it does have a small touch of love done by actors Matt Damon and Ellen Barkin, she is the casino owners secretary.<br/><br/>The director Steven Soderbergh has done this movie perfectly, using the best camera shots possible and helping to make the plot crystal clear so the viewer does not leave with questions such as, what if they hadn't done this or if the actors were at the top of their game.<br/><br/>I give this film 10 stars, for the acting all the cast members did, the brilliant plot, the great director and script writers, BRAVO! To this astonishingly good film. Well appointed actors + a well written plot ÷ a little bit of love x humor = BRILLIANT. A well made, great film which is highly recommended by myself."

","Steven is kind of like an idotsavant; I can never really tell what his motivation is behind his films, only this one was easy: pimp the pretty boys of Hollywood, stack cheddar (make money) until he's ready to do his normal avant-garde film masterpieces. One of my favorite film of all times in the history of film making, that I've seen in my limited and speck of a life times was Soderbergh's Limey; In my opinion it crushed Johnathan Glazer's Sexy Beast in its portrayal of old tuff guys. Steven is Obi Wan and given the ridiculous premise behind the Ocean series he's able to deliver what the people want: handsome Clooney and Pitt looking like GQ models and heart throbs while exercising genius level intellect in making hundreds of millions dollars from their enemies. Their are tons of aerial shots of Vegas which captures it's sheer immensity and focused invention of just having fun; sort of like a playground for the LCD/Plasma television generation. Images become boring after a while; even a gigantic construction machines can't make the small world of this film any more interesting. This film in no way exhibited the enormous potential of talents of this director. Brad Pitt was a little tongue tied in this film when delivering his lines; sort of like he has problems with large technical words. His acting; I'm sorry: his walking on the lot and collecting 20 million dollars was awesome, only he left nothing in return: non-existent performance. George Clooney was really good. He appeared to be working at making this Ocean work, but with no love interest there was just no charm or magic; yet he was still the sharpest tool in the shed. Clooney has yet to deliver a performance that has impressed me as a film lover; will this ever happen. Matt Damon always has a good while acting; it's natural, as if he's got nothing to prove. I love how he makes himself look like a complete ass in the Ocean's series, and this one may be his best effort yet: complete with props and new persona's. My favorite Damon film without hesitation or doubt has to be Good Will Hunting, just for the sheer fact that he made everyone look so good, thus ""good will."" The MVP of this film was Casey Affleck his character situation was the most hilarious. I seriously wanted to see how it all was going to play out. I'm not a big fan of the Affleck's but his character actually had me add some stars to this movie. Ocean's is a great weekend film, you just want to relax and rest your mind, unfortunately their isn't enough eye candy; their could've been at least 500 hot scorching babes to balance the scenes with all the hunks in this movie. I just can't believe out of all these unmarried men their was no hook-ups in Vegas; such plot deviations might've added to the humor and the feel of Vegas - OK flick; would'nt watch it again though."

","When Reuben is double crossed by hotel and casino owner Willie Bank, Danny Ocean comes to see if he can appeal to Bank's code of honour and make him do the right thing. When this rather naïve approach fails, Ocean calls in his gang to organise an incredibly elaborate sting on the things that Bank cares most about  his money, his awards and his reputation.<br/><br/>The Eleven remake was like a guilty pleasure  all slick and stylish but with no substance but yet still fun and effortlessly enjoyable. Twelve was more of the same but a messy plot did suck the life out of it and meant it was significantly less fun. I came to Thirteen off the back of good reviews, but then that was the same story with Twelve so I did have some degree of caution. Thirteen sort of sits in the middle of these two films, not quite as messy as Twelve but not quite as slick and fun as Thirteen. The reasons for this are many but I must stress that the film more or less still works as a popcorn movie that is a welcome sight after the parade of rubbish threequels so far this summer (Shrek, Spiderman, Pirates).<br/><br/>The problem I did have with it was that it seemed a little bit less like they had come up with a cool narrative and then build around that with as many stars as possible. Rather, they knew the stars were there for it and it was a matter of coming up with a plot. Sadly the plot doesn't totally ring true because there is too much in it that I questioned. Of course the first film wasn't set in the real world but it had the pace and cool points for me to just go with it. Here the whole drilling thing was an issue for me and the ""con"" was too elaborate  even by the standards of this film series! A little too much going on in that area does rather mean it sags as soon as it takes its foot off the pedal  even if that is only for a second or two. Mostly the material here just retreads the ideas from the first movie, but makes everything a bit bigger to try and make it have the same effect. It doesn't totally work as you can see the stretch marks on it and how worn some of it feels. It does lack freshness and it is telling that the only bit I thought was really quite imaginative and original was also pretty amusing was the wonderful absurdity of Virgil's part of the scam stalling as he leads a fight for worker rights.<br/><br/>Of course it helps to have Soderberg on board as director because, as his own cinematographer, he makes the film look great and the post-production draws on this with great music and effects which really make the whole thing look and feel like it is being project onto the finest silk. Even when the material is weak (and at times it is very weak), the style and the slick delivery really carry it. Of course for many viewers this will be far from enough but, as much as I hate to admit being won over by style without substance, it does work here.<br/><br/>Helping build this feel yet again is a cast list to die for. This is obviously a big selling point of the film but it does have its downside. Mainly this is in how little everyone but Brad and George actually has to do or say and this has the knock-on effect of making the film feel a bit like a red carpet parade rather than a story. Pitt and Clooney are great in it and show why women everywhere love them; they are slick and smooth throughout and have the lion's share of the film. Damon's material is weak and he was only OK as a result  he didn't convince with Barkin and why he was wearing the nose from The Hours I'm not sure. Pacino is a good addition and works well on screen without really trying  however it might have been more fun to give him the material and let him loose. Cheadle has scaled back his accent and also has very, very little to do or say. Qin is OK, as are Gould, Mac, Affleck, Caan, Reiner and a few others  nobody really ever threatening to steal the film. Izzard did well to get as many scenes as he did while Julian Sands managed to not be the kiss of death than he is known for being (although he was hardly in it) I thought Ellen Barkin looked great (not ""for her age""  just great) but the material given to her is weak as her strong and sexy character is reduced to stumbling around panting by some unknown chemical. Garcia wasn't used that well either but compared to the pointless bit for Cassel he is the heart of the narrative.<br/><br/>Overall then, this is pretty much what I expected and I quite enjoyed it when it was slick and fun but it is hard not to see where the lack of substance is causing a void that sucks everything else back a bit. Eleven was a mindless pleasure and although Thirteen is not quite at that level it is certainly better than Twelve."
"samseescinema","6","2","4","9 June 2007"," What Ocean's Thirteen achieves is something standard, something basic.
","Ocean's Thirteen reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>Back to basics. This seems to be the mantra for Ocean's Thirteen, which marks the end of the Ocean's trilogy. Twelve, the widely despised sequel, made the mistake of getting creative. They changed the recipe and it made the people squeamish. Critics and audiences alike were held utterly aghast. I went back to it earlier this week in preparation for Thirteen. Watch it again, I dare you. It's easily the best of the trilogy. The film is fun, inventive, and loaded with more style than a fashion magazine, which is more than I can say for Ocean's Thirteen. <br/><br/>It's not that Thirteen is bad. No no no. It just follows in the shoes of all the other franchise letdowns to have been released so far this Summer. Between Spiderman 3, Shrek 3, Pirates 3, and Ocean's Thirteen, a 24 hour depression hotline will have to be launched to service the needs of millions of disappointed adolescent girls. <br/><br/>As in Ocean's Twelve, Thirteen doesn't waste much time with back-story. Director Steven Soderbergh starts the ball rolling at once. His obsessively inventive camera zooms, tracks, dollies and swivels its way into Danny Ocean's life with great immediacy. Longtime friend and criminal companion, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), has fallen ill. His business partner, Willie Bank (Al Pacino), has conned him into financial failure and left him on the brink of death. Bank is posed to open the hottest hotel on the Vegas strip, looking to nail another Five Diamond Award to his pedestal. Without family to assist him, Reuben turns to Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew of thieves for help. <br/><br/>The idea is revenge, but the sort of revenge that doesn't involve a funeral. Not the sort that ""is best served cold,"" as Tarantino would have put it. Danny wants his revenge served steaming in a fajita of clever wit and tact. His plan, hatched with longtime partner, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), is to break the Bank (their pun, not mine). To rob Mr. Bank, they plan to rig each game on his casino's floor for a small window of time. Within the window, with every game rigged, and with thousands of gamblers winning rigged games, Bank could stand to lose a half billion dollars on the night of his hotel's grand opening. <br/><br/>As you might have noticed, the Ocean crew has abandoned the foreign vaults and international heists for a second romp in their hometown, Las Vegas. They're doing what they know best. For Steven Soderbergh, he's just doing what worked the first time around. This is fine, even if the execution is uninteresting. All the same motions are processed successfully, except that the heist, maybe due to a strangely passive Pacino delivery, comes off somewhat ho-hum. There's no big reveal at the end. No twist or turning of the tables. The heist either worked or it didn't. And that's all. <br/><br/>What you might not have noticed, however, are Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who play the wily love interests of Danny and Rusty. Their characters are all but absent. We find the men commiserating the complexities of relationships between blueprinting their heist, one always finishing the sentence for the other, but Ms. Roberts and Ms. Zeta-Jones never show their faces. This seems to be a shame since the sly push and pull of the romances in the earlier films made for some of the more satisfying sequences. The chemistry worked. But Danny resolves to not involve Tessa (Roberts), saying ""it's not her fight."" <br/><br/>Also missing is the humor. All the old jokes return for repeat go-rounds, including the deep male camaraderie of Rusty and Danny, Linus' (Matt Damon) need to impress his thieve parents, the jock-nerd matching of Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), and all the rest of the inside jokes Ocean fans will fondly remember. But new stabs at humor--including a bizarre sub-plot involving the violent strike of a dice factory in Mexico--fall flat. The boys are all fine at the charming and the chemistry as always, but the new material needs work. Julia Roberts posing as Julia Roberts from Ocean's Twelve was brilliant. Such comic invention seems to be on near-empty here. <br/><br/>What the Ocean's franchise has going for it, luckily, is its cast. Put Pitt, Clooney and Damon in front of a camera for long enough and something worth watching will happen. They're the charmers of Hollywood. Just having these three on screen all at once makes for compelling film-making. So, in all actuality, it was never possible for Ocean's Thirteen to be flat-out bad. I guess I just expected something flashier; something as mischievous and as neat as Ocean's Twelve. What Ocean's Thirteen achieves is something standard, something basic. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"

","The gang slowly learning Chinese for/from Yen, Reuben's Casino-buying habits linked from Ocean's 11, the strange but welcome Mexican workers subplot, the nose gag, the daytime Vegas flavour, and the seamless CGI of the Bank casino.
I like that it's a revenge story designed to defraud and discredit someone. I like Andy Garcia's role. I don't like the lack of female characters, I don't like that it's a typical 'return to form' instead of something new, I don't like that Soderbergh feels as if he's on autopilot, and ugly by design is still ugly; this movie looks insufferably, embarrassingly shoddy. And I hate how Pacino's star power is supposed to make him a villain with none of the subtle and rich nuances of Garcia's first turn.
I can't deny that I enjoy it, bit only because I forget it the most. O13 is a clear vase of diminishing returns. But I'd still bank on the franchise making an exciting return, be it Ocean's 9, Ocean's 14 or Ocean's 21 (as I imagine it should be called in a fun twist), as long as it's a fresh and excited Mr. Soderbergh at the helm."

","I didn't like this when it originally came out, or throughout the years. Started watching it again on Netflix, and it wasn't bad. It was a fairly good addition to the trilogy.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple. A new Vegas owner is causing people problems. The usual suspects come in and try to make things right (or wrong?).<br/><br/>It's a fun watch. Nothing too different to say here. Pacino is okay, passable. Everyone else is basically the same. The story and movie are weaker than the first two, if not much weaker.<br/><br/>Still good effort. Worth a watch sometime.<br/><br/>6"

","Well this was a very dull movie which tried to be like Ocean's 11, but it ended up being even worse than Ocean's 12. The plot was just not intriguing and there was a lack of action scenes. It got a big intriguing in the last 40 minutes of the movie where the heist (If you could call it that) was actually happening. The build-up to it was just boring and a bit confusing. Don't watch this as its probably the worse movie in the Ocean's series, even worse than Ocean's 12 which at least had a bit of excitement in it and was a bit intriguing."
"RagingDraugr","7","0","0","2 March 2019"," 'Ocean's' is back to doing what it does best.
","After an awkward middle entry, 'Ocean's' is back to doing what it does best: engage you in a thrilling heist filled with twists as well as plans for every eventuality. But this time, it's personal. Yes, after a beloved member of Ocean's team, Rueben, is conned out of his investment in a new casino by Willy Bank and has a heart attack as a result, the team decide to make Mr. Bank pay, literally and figuratively, by making his new casino pay out tremendous amounts of money to its patrons on opening night. It's a compelling setup, largely due to the fact that I have grown to become attached to these characters over the course of three films and therefore felt an immense amount of satisfaction watching the 'Eleven' stick it to Mr. Bank. And sure, the idea of another casino heist might seem blasé to fans of the first film. But considering the disastrous attempt at a change in formula with 'Ocean's Thirteen', at least based on the critical response, it's understandable why a 'return-to-form' was made.<br/><br/>So pretty much everything I liked about 'Ocean's Eleven' - the heist plan itself, the characters, the music, the humour, the dialogue - is present in 'Ocean's Thirteen' and it's all great stuff. Not to mention, we get to see Eddie Izzard as Nagel in a more prominent role than in 'Ocean's Twelve' (which is great for me, 'cause I like Eddie Izzard) as well as the glorious Al Pacino in a scenery-chewing, wonderfully brash and brazen performance as Willy Bank, the 'mark' that Ocean's team is after. And the film also has the best editing in the trilogy with (almost) no weird edits at all! Although, it's hard not to feel like you're just watching an overhauled rehash of the first film. Don't get me wrong, it's still enjoyable - but it still has the impression of a rehash all the same considering many of the same elements and 'setups' are here. For example, a seasoned 'Ocean's' viewer knows when the ""Gotcha!"" moments are coming, so they don't have quite as much of a punch to them as they did in the first film. Take for example, the reveal that the FBI agent who apparently arrests Linus, one of Ocean's eleven, is actually Linus' father. The film plays it tongue-in-cheek with a wink to the audience as if to say, ""Bet you didn't see that one coming!""...except we absolutely did.<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10, maybe mid-high 6 or low-mid 7."

","9 June 2007. This third and hopefully final version of Ocean takes a almost tired look at a prolonged criminal caper in Vegas that isn't as exciting nor captivating as its predecessors. The beginning plot outline seems almost desperate and forced together. Too characters, difficult editing and transitions, no time to really get caught up into most of the scenes. There are a few nice comedy pieces sprinkled throughout but absent the strength of female character starlets leaves this movie more about trying to be impressive without much power nor punch.

","Oceans twelve was unlucky as a sequel. Ocean's thirteen however is right on the spot and a succesfull sequel. 13 is an almost exact copy of the original Ocean's Eleven, but who cares, it works splendidly. And in 13 the feel good factor is back which was lacking in 12. And although there are smart twists in 13 they are not that complicated that you cant understand them as was the case in Oceans twelve.<br/><br/>No romances this time. However I did like Julia Roberts and Cahterina Zeta Jones in 11 and 12, I didnt miss the girls in 13. More room for Al Pacino who played the egoistic asshole to a T.<br/><br/>It is a formula film, but great formulas can deliver great enjoyable movies, as is the case with Ocean's 13. You know what you are gonna get. You liked it before and you will like it now. Ofcourse the surprise effect is less great than with the first Ocean's Eleven. I give Ocean's 13 a well deserved 7 points, which may turn into 8 points if I start to appreciate this movie even more during the coming years as did happen with the magnificent Ocean's Eleven which I must have seen a dozen times..."
"filipemanuelneto","4","0","0","21 February 2017"," A decent ending to the Ocean trilogy.
","It seems that the ""Ocean"" trilogy only works when they are in Las Vegas, the city where it all began. In fact, it was hard to do worse after a second movie where everything went wrong. This film maintains the previous cast but focuses the plot on a quest for poetic justice. In fact, the thieves will no longer steal for selfish reasons, but try to punish a villain who double crossed Reuben. A plus for a plot in which the scriptwriter's delirious imagination nearly knocked it all down with such a creative and elaborate assault plan that it lost its credibility. The idea was to recreate the first film on an epic scale, but it was so obvious and exaggerated that it didn't work out. Even with this problem, the film can be digested and we can enjoy and be entertained by it if we don't think too much about that. The cast is the same as the two early films, with George Clooney and Brad Pitt leading, but they do almost the same thing they did before, so there are no surprises or remarks about them. On the other hand, Al Pacino really knows how to look bad as a villain and it was great to see him in another evil role. Vincent Cassel confined himself to an unfortunate cameo, quite unworthy of his talent. Steven Soderbergh, who seems to have recovered from the crash that was ""Ocean's Twelve"", directed the film fairly regularly and close to what we might expect from him: good camera angles, big care with scenery and the use of city landscapes, some visual beauty that looks good when its brightened by a decent soundtrack, as was the case here. And so ended this trilogy, without glory but with its honor washed."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","6","0","0","14 June 2016"," Silly fun
","As silly, gaudy and drawn out the Ocean's franchise had gotten by its third outing, I still somewhat enjoyed Ocean's Thirteen, an overblown attempt to keep the magic alive that most of the time trips over its own bells and whistles. That being said, the gang is all there, and that alone is good for some laughs. This time around, Eliott Gould's cranky charmer Reuben has been ousted from his Vegas property by Willie Bank (Al Pacino) a ruthless and ludicrously rich casino tycoon with big plans for the future. Reuben is left in a dazed depression, and the gang all drifts back together to try and rob the hell out of Pacino, using methods and cons so over the top they almost seem like a parody of the former films. Pacino is a bit more clownish than Andy Garcia's grim Terry Benedict was in the first film, which adds to the cavalier absence of any sense of real danger. In fact, Benedict is now chummy with the gang himself, which is a cute turn of events but kind of seems too silly. Ellen Barkin adds a lot of class as Pacino's head honcho, fitting into the Ocean world nicely. The gang I'd all back and more eccentric than ever, with Matt Damon scoring comedic points in one of the funniest prosthetic jobs I've ever seen. Newcomers to the show include Julian Sands, Oprah Winfrey and a reliably hapless David Paymer. It's not that this one takes the formula too far, it's just that we've been there, done that, got the t- shirt and there was really not much need for it. I won't say no though, because the blue print of what made the first so fun is still there, it's just been jazzed up and adorned with a few too many gilded sequins and fancy jib jab. Still enjoyable."
"JohnHowardReid","6","0","0","13 June 2015"," Just passable!
","I'm amazed this movie attracted so many good reviews. For me, it offered just passable entertainment. In fact, three quarters of the way through, I was so bored with it, I seriously considered walking out, but I was jammed in and it was difficult to move. I will admit that the movie did improve in the last quarter-hour or so, when it finally got around to presenting a bit of action. Admittedly, I'd not seen the previous entries in this series, but the script didn't bother to fill in any of the essential details I'd missed and simply assumed that I already knew who everybody was and what their relationships and motivations were. And it's hard to believe that the film cost a cool $85,000,000. To break even, it would need to gross at least $150,000,000. I believe it did actually gross around $117,000,000. Those figures, I find very surprising. Good old Warner Home Video sent me the excellent Warner DVD, on which I actually found the short, ""Vegas: An Opulent Illusion"", much more interesting and entertaining."
"Sammy_ExpertCritic","6","0","0","25 December 2014"," Not best!!
","A similar plot with a dragged storyline. The movie shows the story of the same robbers but this time out to seek a vengeance. Al Pacino as the main antagonist, is not proper use of his talent. Unrealistic events and a weak script, makes it weak compared to expectations. A similar comical heist, with lots of unrealistic twists and taken for good support on the good side, makes it too predictable. Although the lead actors perform good and try their best, the loop holes make them suffer. The first movie with static script in Ocean's trilogy. Watch this movie without any expectations or don't compare it with the previous two. You can give it a one time watch."
"alindsay-al","4","0","0","12 September 2014"," a forgetful film that proves there is nothing like the original
","Boy did they milk the oceans franchise. After a fantastic first film and a average second film it was up for debate what this film would be like and it is just simply forgetful. This sees Danny, rusty and they crew going on a revenge heist against Willy bank after Reuben is betrayed by bank. Now I think George Clooney and brad Pitt did a great job in both of the other films but in this one it feels like they're being lazy and phoning it in which is hugely disappointing considering how good they have been. A weakness of this film is also just how large the cast is and how it focuses on nobody like the past two films did. I also feel it really missed a main female character as the previous ones did a good job and really helped the film. I did like matt Damon in this film and I also did like Andy Garcia returning and al pacino as the new villain was fun. The story was awful as half the time I had no idea what was going on and once again with it focusing on everyone it focused on nobody which was a big reason for a disappointing story. The script was alright and there was some funny dialogue but not enough to help the film enough. I think returning to Vegas was another great idea and the style of this film is great it is a shame the substance is not so good. This should be the end for this franchise for a while and let's just remember just how good oceans 11 was."

When a ruthless casino owner named Willy Bank double-crosses their good buddy Reuben Tishkoff; this causes Tishoff to have a heart attack. Danny Ocean wishes to help out his friend and vows that his team and himself will do anything to bring Willy Bank and everything he's got down. Even if it includes hiring some assistance from one of their own old opponents in Vegas, Terry Benedict.<br/><br/>*Special Stars- Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Elliot GOuld, Ellen Barkin.<br/><br/>*Theme- Friendship is thicker than money.<br/><br/>*Trivia/location/goofs- Color. Las Vegas, NV. The line ""You shook Sinatra's hand"" mentioned several times in the movie is a reference to Frank Sinatra who played the first role as 'Danny Ocean' in the original Ocean's Eleven (1960). Matt Damon's (Linus) fake nose disguise ploy is called ""The Brody"". It's a reference to the french actor Adrien Brody. The dialog phrase ""Billy Martin"" that Danny calls for to Willie during the Reuben's hospitalization is a gambling slang for second chance. The phrase refers to famed Major League Baseball New York Yankee's manager, Billy Martin. Despite his talents as a manager (he led the New York Yankees to two World Series titles); Martin's fiery temper, fueled by his alcoholism, often got him into trouble and as a result, he was fired multiple times by owner George Steinbrunner. Despite his character flaws and drinking, Billy Martin was always being given a ""second chance"". Also, the character's dialog make several references to a ""Susan B. Anthony"" deal in their heist. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin manufactured by the US mint in 1979. It was so similar in appearance and size to a regular quarter and many people dropped it into a slot machine without realizing what it was worth. This 'con' method was used twice in the film, though the people are using an ordinary coin they don't realize that it will be worth millions in the slot: first by the woman in 'The Bank' casino who wins the million dollar jackpot and later by the tormented hotel reviewer at the Vegas airport slot machine.<br/><br/>*Emotion- The fun and rich romp for the viewer.

","I liked ocean's eleven and I loved ocean's twelve for being so uncommon but I really thought that ocean's thirteen was unnecessary. This is really unfortunate remembering that it brought Al Pacino into the already all star cast.<br/><br/>There are some points why it became so redundant to the sequel. First, inconsistency. It really bothered me that Don Chaedel had a thick British accent in the first two movies but had a real American accent in the third. Also, François Toulour (Fincent Cassel) had really small role, despite remembering he was the arc nemesis of Ocean's Twelve.<br/><br/>Second Point, bad story.

It also seemed like they were able to actually give each character a fair amount of screen time whereas in the second film most seemed meaningless. There wasn't much additional development of them but they all contributed to the film in some way. As for the actual plot, it felt more genuine and not just thrown together like the last one.

","This one isn't as good as ""Ocean's Eleven"" but it's better than ""Ocean's Twelve"". This is more of a mission to wreck someone by stealing from that person than just mainly focusing on the money. Although money does play a factor.

And this time the teams main target is Willy Bank(Al Pacino) after he screws Reuben on a deal. The heist and dialogues have it's clever moments although some parts are just absurd and doesn't make much sense. It's a entertaining heist flick but just didn't stand out all that much to the point I could call it a memorable flick.

"tieman64","Null","0","0","20 February 2012"," Weakest in the trilogy
","The ""Ocean's 11"" franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"", a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his ""Ocean's 11"" remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres.<br/><br/>While Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"" made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 – everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson – today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't ""cool"" constantly changing, ""Ocean's 11"" also looks completely neutered, its ""smooth"", ""relaxed"" and ""cool"" cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's ""riches"", ""bling"", ""money"", ""rule breaking"", ""flashy accessories"" and ""bad boy criminality"" (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld – both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of ""Ocean's 11"" in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. ""I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place,"" is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic – first act: assemble the ""samurai"", second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured – Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money.<br/><br/>Soderbergh describes his ""Ocean's 11"" as a ""big wind up toy"", and while its designed to be ""just entertainment"", it does fit in with a number of the director's ""heavier"" films (""King of the Hill"", ""Che"", ""Traffic"", ""Eric Brockovich"", ""The Girlfriend Experience""), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, ""to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable"". Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into ""haves"" and ""have nots"", whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings.<br/><br/>Soderbergh would release a sequel, ""Oceans 12"", some years later. This one takes the form of a ""con movie"", its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, ""Oceans 13"" in 2007. The villain's name is literally ""Bank"" (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb.<br/><br/>7.5/10 – Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's ""Heist"" and Neil Jordan's ""The Good Thief"", a remake of Melville's genre defining ""Bob The Gambler""."

But any movie you have to watch twice just to understand what is going on is not what I would call good movie. This time around Danny and his gang are after Willy Banks. Banks two timed their friend Rueban causing him to have a heart attack. So, they want payback by sabotaging Banks' casino opening. Their plan is to rig all the games so everyone is a winner. Then to get all out of the door before they gamble the winnings back to the casino. Rigging slots, craps, roulette sounds impossible right; well not when you are super cool George Clooney and Brad Pitt. They also must find a way to snatch Banks' 5 diamond necklaces worth 1/4 billion.<br/><br/>All the players are back except Julie Roberts and Catherize Zeta Jones.

","Perpetuation of some very misguiding myths. I went to Las Vegas last year, and it IS really a symbol of an empire, albeit a decaying one. A world where most of the natural rhythms are lost, and the real transgressions and follies are institutionalized and centralized in this fake city of make believe: money and power, sex and love, can be bought and sold because elsewhere missing. All this powered by an unsustainable amount of energy, perpetuating an unsustainable way of life. This movie, like it's predecessors, in some ways attacks this status quo by showing how this group of stars are in some ways ""Robin Hoods"" or ""Lupins"": criminals on the good side. A theme I usually like; but a taste that would've been sufficiently appeased by just one of these Ocean's movies."

Casey Affleck is fun as usual. Pacino? I've never really understood why people think he's so great, but I guess it's down to personal taste. I personally think the ""series"" is done.

","Ocean's Thirteen is a vast improvement over the disappointing Ocean's Twelve. Like the first Ocean movie, it's set in Vegas, and the plot such as it is, having only one setting to worry about means more time for the characters to interact, with each other, and also set in motion the revenge heist.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the big name added to the cast here, and I think it's his least intense performance for awhile. I got the impression he enjoyed not being the lead and had fun as Wily Banks, the villain of the piece - though in truth even the good guys are bad guys when you get down to it.<br/><br/>As for the main gang, although Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Cheadle and Garcia are all good, the movie is actually stolen by Casey Affleck as Virgil. The little story he gets set in a Mexican factory not only is very funny, but nearly steals the movie. One of the things I've always admired about this series (and other big movie sagas), is the way they can get all the actors to return for each movie. For some movies, it could be due to being signed up for more as part of the deal, but here I think it's simply the fact they enjoy working together and it shows. The chemistry between them seems effortless, and also the fact that they like to poke fun at each other helps. Listen to the last exchange between Clooney and Pitt and you'll see what I mean!<br/><br/>The actual plot about getting revenge when one of their number is cut out a big deal is not really that important. What's important is the fun you have simply getting to enjoy it being played out. It may not be up there with the first one, but as I mentioned, more than makes up for the disappointing sequel.<br/><br/>If this is the end of the series, then it's a worthy finish."
"mysteriesfan","4","2","5","1 August 2007"," Plays too fast and loose to amount to much
","Being new to the ""Ocean"" movies, I did not know what to expect from Ocean's 13. Given the cast, especially Al Pacino, I was looking forward to it. My enthusiasm drained away pretty quickly. The friend who invited me and who had liked both the Ocean's 11 remake and Ocean's 12, had the same reaction I did -- disappointment with the relative lack of action and of spark to the characters here.<br/><br/>Ocean's 13 has a light, glib flow and style to it. It has some pleasant, attractive actors and scenery. Pacino's electronic security system gives the movie some focus and challenge. But its choppy pace and frivolity are disappointing. When a movie, like this one, sets up a series of major and minor ""cons,"" it should use subtle, clever strokes and should play fair. This movie plays fast and loose on both scores.<br/><br/>Within minutes, Ocean has lined up countless moles in key positions in Pacino's casino. This occurs in flimsy and unbelievable ways, like simply dropping in and making an open-ended promise to a desk clerk that she will be made a manager, slipping a restaurant manager some fast cash, and catching a casino floor manager pawning fancy house silverware. The way Ocean infiltrates a man into the casino as a dealer is played more for laughs than believability, and it is left completely up in the air how later blowing the cover of that same man makes any sense for Ocean's plans. A quick, easy chat with one big-shot is all it takes for Ocean to get carloads of high-rolling ""whale"" gamblers to up and leave Pacino's hotel.<br/><br/>Very early on, Ocean's team seems to have free run of the casino's security and electronics floor. With ease, they repeatedly tramp back and forth across it, so that, for example, one of his men can relieve a guard at just the right moment. Details about how Ocean plans to fix Pacino's dice, roulette wheels, and slot machines, and use a gigantic drill to mimic an earthquake, are glossed over to the point they come off as amateur science fiction - not to mention ""the Gilroy,"" some sort of magical love potion used to reduce the only mildly competent guest character in the film, Pacino's top manager Ellen Barkin, to jello.<br/><br/>Particularly poorly handled is the way the team spoils Pacino's attempt to get a five-star rating for his hotel. The movie goes completely over the top in inflicting all manner of extreme, unbelievable, foul treatment on the implausible-acting visiting critic. Not content at depriving Pacino of five stars, the movie pounds the joke into the ground, not stopping even at one star. How, in the midst of all of the luxury and other satisfied hotel guests, are we supposed to think that the critic, or anyone else, would believe such an exaggerated, isolated experience? As if in recognition of the clumsy, near-sadistic, unfunny excess, there is a simple-minded, contrived scene at the end where the beleaguered critic is helped to win big at an airport slot machine.<br/><br/>Playing fair not only means that the film cannot lift off completely from reality, but it also means that both the good and bad guys need to be up to the challenge. Here, Pacino does nothing but talk tough. He is given fair notice by Ocean at the start, but does not make a single smart move the entire movie, only mistake after mistake (such as being easily manipulated into allowing Bernie Mac to set up a game on the casino floor and generally allowing Ocean's men to swarm all over his hotel, completely undetected and undeterred). In one token scene, which the script comes right out and tells us is meant to show how savvy Pacino is, he taps into an FBI computer to search for the identity and known associates of a dealer who Ocean planted in the casino. But this incident only makes everyone look bad. It depends on Ocean confusingly blowing the dealer's cover, it nearly destroys Ocean's plans, and the way Ocean and his men get out of it is wildly exaggerated and far too convenient. Also way too easily, Ocean dismisses Pacino's threats at the end, confirming the character's total impotence.<br/><br/>Indeed, the few adversities faced by Ocean are trumped-up accidents, either overcome too easily or too implausibly. As a result, there is a near-total lack of suspense and a diminished, anticlimactic sense of accomplishment at the end.<br/><br/>The film has an overall slack pace, despite -- or maybe because of -- rapid cutaways between short, thin scenes. At times, it feels like slow-motion, which can be one of director Soderbergh's worst tendencies. This saps not only the drama but also the humor. There are so many characters that few if any have time to shine. As if to make up for this, Damon, Cheadle, and Bernie Mac get strained, far-fetched, show-boating scenes that only fall flat. Andy Garcia seems injected almost as an afterthought.<br/><br/>The film evokes some sentimentality about the Elliott Gould character, including a short scene reminiscing about ""the old Las Vegas,"" but much about this is superficial and unexplained. His end scenes, in which he shows up at and struts around Pacino's casino in fancy dress with a big cigar sticking out of his mouth, acting triumphant based on absolutely nothing that he himself has done, strike a false and ineffective note.<br/><br/>Nothing could be easier with a movie like this than writing a canned, shallow, gushing review that ignores all of the problems, settles for the movie's famous faces and places and glitzy, smooth, and easy feel, and hides behind lazy labels like ""popcorn movie"" or ""caper flick."" Of course, these qualities, and the talented people involved, give the movie some entertainment value. But not nearly enough. Any serious review has to come to grips with the failings that make this movie a disappointing missed opportunity even as mildly entertaining fluff."

"Monotreme02","7","2","5","9 June 2007"," A solid entertainment that doesn't quite reach the heights of the first
","This is a good entertainment. The first film in the trilogy was a great entertainment. When Ocean's Eleven came along, I remember myself being totally surprised  I had no idea there could be so much ""cool"" in one movie. The all-star cast, which we almost take for granted by this third installment, was unprecedented when it came out. And Soderbergh, who had a solid, fluid, complex script to start with, took all the pieces and mixed them all together to create a fantastically smooth, slick, fast-paced, funny and just plain enjoyable entertainment.<br/><br/>But with Ocean's Twelve the gang sort of stumbled. The film suffered from two major flaws. The first was that it gave off the impression of a ""guy's night out"" and not an actual structured movie, with a solid plot or characters. And deriving from this, it just seemed like nobody really cared about what was actually going on. Soderbergh went completely wild with his experimental film style; meanwhile the scriptwriters sloppily glued a plot together that started out from Benedict trying to get revenge on the Eleven and eventually became some sort of competition between thieves that required a lot of suspension of disbelief. Couple that with the actors basically just having their ball throughout and the movie basically being one big private joke, and you had a serious problem unless you were George, Matt, Brad, Steven or any of the other guys involved. The entire movie emulated this sort of feeling that the people on the screen knew something that we, the audience, didn't.<br/><br/>Luckily, everyone got their act together for the third installment, starting from the scriptwriters. The gang invited a new screen writing team on board replacing the original writers, and in turn the script returned to a more ""back to basics"" style. This time around no time was wasted and no unnecessary plot threads left astray like the all-over-the-place Ocean's Twelve. Once again, the film returned to the simple, straightforward style of the first: A gang of well-characterized thieves takes revenge on an evil Las Vegas megalomaniac by robbing his casino. The motive that sets things in motion this time around are a little more otherworldly than in the first film, in which Danny Ocean, unbeknownst to his criminal colleagues, set up the Benedict job in order to get back his wife Tess. In Thirteen the motive doesn't work all that well, but it doesn't matter because most of the film, like in the first one, chronicles the set-up and eventually the execution of the job, and it's just a blast to watch. In addition, I must take my hat off to the writers for actually being able to conceive such an amazingly and unbelievably elaborate heist as is featured in this film. It is unfathomably complex and yet, as it all unfolds in the third act, every little thing falls exactly into place. It's simply a thrill to watch.<br/><br/>The whole cast is back with the notable omission of a strong female actress. I mean, with all due respect to Ellen Barkin, she isn't exactly Julia Roberts, and in his quest to assemble the most shining all-star cast possible, Soderbergh had a winner with Roberts on board. That said, Al Pacino is quite the addition to the cast. Although we're all more than familiar with his shtick, it was absolutely wonderful to see him in this piece. I rather understandably skipped his last few forays (Two for the Money, 88 Minutes) so essentially the last time I saw him on in a film was in The Merchant of Venice back in 2004. I do hope Pacino does choose to take more higher quality projects such as this one, because it's really sad to see his career in the dump  and worse, he himself admits that the worse the script the bigger the paycheck. The rest of the cast, obviously, do a fantastic job, but the real treat is to see each cast member in his own moment acting opposite the legendary Pacino.<br/><br/>In an attempt to create the most unbelievably luxurious hotel man could possibly imagine, production designer Philip Messina went above and beyond to create a treasure cove of amazingly gorgeous sets that are the interior of the Bank hotel. And of course, Soderbergh, who also serves as the film's cinematographer under the code name Peter Andrews, delivers some interesting material, especially in terms of lighting and colouration but also some totally wild composition and an unprecedented use of the zoom lens.<br/><br/>In all, Ocean's Thirteen is a fantastic, light-hearted, fast-paced, fun and funny entertainment that contains a taut, focused screenplay that is elaborate and complex while never crossing over the line into confusing. And although it doesn't completely recreate the fresh-faced magic of the first film in the trilogy, Ocean's Eleven, it certainly emulates a similar sensation. It is safe to say that Ocean's Thirteen is the best and most satisfying of this summer's entire onslaught of threequels. Just one thing left me scratching my head: with the omission of Tess, I just don't understand who is the 13th member of the team as appears in the title?"

","After seemingly endless movies about torture and depravity, it's nice to see some class and style re-injected into the Hollywood film. ""Ocean's 13"" recaptures the style and charisma in the first film and maybe even brings a bit of the style of the Rat Pack back into the picture.<br/><br/>O.K., so it's vacuous, materialistic and lacks substance...we know that going in, so it's simply a measure of style, sophistication and humor. This movie has all that, in spades (it had to be said.) The latest installment of ""Oceans"" is witty and charming and even self-referential without having to try and overtly re-create successful scenes from the previous films.<br/><br/>Pacino makes a much better heavy than Andy Garcia, who reprises his role as the nemesis/wanna-be member of Ocean's gang."

You can sit back, relax and watch the Ocean Boys do their thing - once again. It is almost refreshing to sit in a theater for just under two hours (Pirates is nearly 3 hrs, Spider-Man is not as long but feels like it at 2 hrs and 20 mins).

","I did not see Ocean's Eleven or Twelve. I had no intentions of seeing this film in the first place, but my friends wanted to last night, so I went along with them and was pleasantly surprised. Basically, the movie is about a Las Vegas hotshot, Willie Bank, who is going to open a casino. Danny Ocean and his conspirators disliked Bank in the first place, and when Bank cut out his partner, Reuben, Ocean's crew decided to make a revenge strike on Bank's new, self-named casino. The acting was very good. George Clooney and Brad Pitt did a very nice job as the main protagonists. I thought that some of the editing and camera-work was a little goofy (comedic facial close-ups were used a trifle too much), but hey, the movie was funny. Being that this was my first time seeing an Ocean's film, I was a little confused, but I was able to figure out the general gist, and seeing it again earlier today helped out a lot. I would recommend this film to all viewers."
"diac228","8","2","6","9 June 2007"," Who is friend #13 anyway?
","What happens when your sequel to a highly successful heist caper delivers a plot twist so unappealing it makes Carrot Top look like Brad Pitt? Go back to the basics. Start from the top, check and see just what made the original so much better and entertaining. Nonetheless, this is what happens with the third installment, and ultimately delivers. Using an excellent staff, quirky camera work, plenty of subtle and unsubtle humor, decent soundtrack, and lack of drama (that was all-too-present in Ocean's Twelve), the third part of this surprise hit trilogy actually holds up well against the original while easily surpassing the sequel. While the lack of women may be a bit of a downer, it could be for the best of the movieand for the men after all it does take place in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>After being able to pay off all their debts and whatnot, their next heist has to do with revenge above anything else. After one of the Ocean squad gets ripped off and loses almost all his money to the egotistical and powerful casino owner Willy Bank, the rest of the crew seeks revenge as Bank's latest casino is about to open. Using high-tech gadgets, seduction, and even the help of former enemies, Ocean and the crew attempt to destroy West's opening night by making millions upon millions of dollars for them and other people in a matter of five minutes. While the plot isn't exactly the most believable out there, it doesn't distract from the overall experience.<br/><br/>Ocean's 13 is all about the cast of characters, their chemistry together, and their interactions with each other. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon are the main three in terms of screen time and also in terms of performance. Clooney and Pitt carry this aura of smoothness and sophisticated style that not everyone in the Hollywood world has. Helping the pack is Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and more. Rounding out the cast is yet another great performance from the excellent Al Pacino as the villain getting what he deserves, and then Andy Garcia whom was the villain from the previous two heist movies.<br/><br/>The budget here is not spent on explosions, monsters, or extensive use of CGI, but instead on expensive yet jaw-dropping sets and props. The casino looked magnificent from the inside and from the outside, as well as pretty much every place in the entire movie (with the exception of Mexico, but you'll see why). In the meantime, returning director Steven Soderbergh gleefully plays and toys with the camera with different angles, different kinds of shots, wide variety of lengths of shots, and even borrowing a technique that was made famous in Fight Club. While its nothing experimental, Soderbergh does a good job showcasing a story using a variety of techniques so the movie never even considers looking stale. Completing the directing is a sort of old-school vibe that accompanies the soundtrack. It begins to look so dated that you might expect even Sinatra to make an appearance.<br/><br/>Pacing is what is a turn-off for some moviegoers, and pretty much what destroyed Ocean's 12 (despite the unforgivable plot). Unlike recent third installments, the pacing here remains consistent, and for the most part works well. The majority of Ocean's 13 is setting up the grand scheme, which ranges from an underground bunker in Nevada to a factory in Mexico. The third act is when the plan starts getting off the ground, and the payoff is definitely great for the audience and the lucky cast of gamblers unaware of what is about to unfold.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Despite some missing members of before (where'd all the women go?) Ocean's 13 is slick, stylish, fun, and everything that made the original a surprise smash. The chemistry among the crew remains intact, but now we have a better story to follow, and a better heist to capture on film. Capturing all the glee is Soderbergh, who once again excels in putting his distinct methods of film-making to good use as he contributes a dosage of style, pizazz and old-school flavor to the movie. The ending leaves the door open for more, and as long as they remain as entertaining as this, why shouldn't we continue the series? Clooney, Damon, and especially Brad Pitt seem to have a lot of fun robbing people and screwing around. Whatever happened to the good-ol' days of classic, one-track storytelling anyway?"

","That's not to say all the Ocean movies are terrible. The first for me was very enjoyable, while the second while lazy and convoluted was okay. This film does have its moments, it is stylishly shot, has a brilliantly slick opening sequence and I liked the score. However, despite these good moments, it not only doesn't correct the mistakes of the previous time but makes more on the way. The direction is disappointingly lethargic, and the story is unevenly paced and convoluted. To me the script is not very good at all, in fact at worst some of it is pretty darn bad, while the film further suffers from being too long and too slow. Even the acting is disappointing, this is a great cast but some of them don't have much to do or don't know what to do with their material. Al Pacino comes off worst, he is a great actor but here he seems uncomfortable and uninterested. So overall, a disappointment really.

","Ocean's 11 was a decent movie with a very good plot twist at the end. Ocean's 12 was a smart comedy with very good performances from all actors. And Ocean's 13 is a movie that passes by unnoticed.<br/><br/>Although performances were acceptable, the plot isn't attractive. Reuben got betrayed by Pacino, had a heart stroke and the guys want revenge. And that's fine. But Sodenbergh tries to make PAcino look like some invincible character, and his hotel like some sort of hi-tech Alcatraz where no one can steal anything, nor commit fraud because of some sort of ""supercomputer"" and super ultra high technology. The problem with this is that this looks so artificial and forced that is difficult to believe. There are some ""funny"" moments but they don't make you laugh hard.<br/><br/>Besides, there is no way Benedict would trust a guy like Ocean after what happened in the first movie. That's a flaw in the movie. Another flaw is that they don't explain why PAcino is so upset with Mr Bank, leaving aside the fact that the Bank hotel is supercool and is a strong competitor to the Bellagio.<br/><br/>One more flaw is that Sodenbergh made Toulour (one of the best's thieves of the world in O12) look like some sort of brainless thug that is easy to deceive.<br/><br/>For all this reasons Ocean's 13 = 5*"

","I watched Oceans 13 last night. I suspect that by next week I will have no recollection of it whatever. A star-studded cast, apparently a no limit production fund, great hype prior to its release, I was surprised at how disappointed I was. I come away from this movie thinking that it was just a grand boondoggle where everyone involved had a great time making it, probably were paid extremely well (or maybe donated their time and labor to the producers/ director). I doubt this film will ever make any money. There simply is no substance. I have trouble trying to understand how many of these fine actors ever got involved with this project."

","As far as trilogies go, well, to all those here on IMDb who clicked in a 6 or below, I say, ""what exactly do you expect from a third effort stretching the same conceptual storyline?"" I would like to chime in on just one aspect of the movie. First, I really enjoyed the movie, and found it to be refreshing, surprising, and full of new unpredictable content.<br/><br/>The fact that there was not a heavy presence of estrogen from some leading character made the movie all the more intelligible, at least from a majority of what I would like to think is the male perspective; how most guys would view the third Oceans. You have to consider...the role played out in the first two movies were weak anyway, (I say this to all who feel that a woman lead character was missing from the third movie) and just a bit of filler at best if you really consider it as I just typed. I liked the third Ocean's effort without that dominant female character. I thought it brought just the right measure of thievery. Yeah, to those who felt gypped from a lack of female presence, well ya know what? You WERE robbed! HA - HA!"

'Ocean's Twelve' although was fun but very confusing. 'Oceans's Thirteen' was definitely an improvement over the second film. The story was more structured, and although still contained flashbacks, was still easy to follow. The cast are all back and still great. Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones are missing from this film, but it is no great loss, and Al Pacino are certainly someone who would make up to it. His scenes are just great and some of the best scenes involve him.

","The third ""Oceans"" movie is something of a return to form after the irritating self indulgence and in-jokes of ""Ocean's Twelve"". It still isn't nearly as sharp as ""Ocean's Eleven"", but I think there is enough good stuff here that fans of ""Eleven"" will like ""Thirteen"". <br/><br/>I find that I have to agree with the comments that you have to suspend belief and critical thinking to swallow either the plot or some of the character's reactions to certain plot events.Mostly, I enjoyed it for the way the actors inhabited their roles and for the glittering high polish portrayal of Las Vegas itself. <br/><br/>For all his overexposure and tabloid hijinks, Brad Pitt can still make you forget all that when he is on screen; he shows why he is still worth the Big Bucks in this movie. ""Rusty"" continues to be the coolest and most likable smug bastard in recent movie memory, with George Clooney's ""Danny Ocean"" right behind him. And everyone here has just the right combination of savvy, cool, and likability.<br/><br/>***mild spoiler*** I did have some trouble with the Damon/Barkin seduction scenes. Although the ""Sponder"" character was delineated as a grade A, pure-dee ""bitch"", it was a still bit troubling watching her get sandbagged by ""the Gilroy"" gimmick. Yes, nothing actually happened, but really, there isn't that much functional difference using the Gilroy and slipping Rohypnol into her champagne. The movie loses a star for that little gaffe. ***end mild spoiler***<br/><br/>The dialog also seems to be a little sharper this time around, and Soderberg made the right choice by returning the setting to Vegas and keeping it there ***mild spoiler*** except for a weird diversion to Mexico for several scenes that really only seemed to be there to give Casey Affleck and Scott Caan something to do. That cost the movie another star***end mild spoiler***<br/><br/>I think what really puts the spark back into the story is that the feel is a little warmer this time around - the little kicker in the last 20 seconds of the film especially gave it just the right note. <br/><br/>So, yes, I liked it. There's no way the plot could hold up to close examination, but there were so many great lines and character bits and beautiful shots of Vegas and cool musical cues that the movie won me over. I'll probably get all three Oceans"" movie when the inevitably trilogy DVD pack comes out in a year or three, just for all the neat little moments scattered like gems throughout. <br/><br/>If you like Brad Pitt, George Clooney, caper films, Vegas films, make it a point to seek this one out."
"Astralan","7","1","2","1 July 2007"," Getting to the end was a bit tedious
","I was transported back to the early sixties during the opening credits to this film. The big band sound saturated you with that Rat Pack sensation where you almost expect Sinatra, Dean and Davis Jr. to walk out into the theater and serenade you with some new material. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen, and if I had a copy of this movie, I would have to play it a second time just to be able to play along with the new establishment of the Rat Pack. I have to interject a side story that seems to have paralleled the filming of this movie, so bear with me because I think it probably helped to guide this movie and probably saved it from some film making pitfalls: The new Rat Pack consist of primarily George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon with charter memberships with Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner and Bernie Mac (who recently announced his retirement from film - we'll see if that's true eventually). The reports say that during the shooting of the entire filming, they had one huge high steaks poker game going on that the entry fee started at $50,000. Sometimes I wonder if their heads were in the movie or the game. There were more than just the Rat Pack in play here, and most of the cast had it's opportunity to cash in on the game. I guess my problem with this movie was the cohesiveness of the script. Sometimes it just had the Valley Girl mentality to it: ""And then he went:""Whoa"", and then the other dude said: "".. but then this guy said this, and everything feel apart"", and then the first guy said: ""DUDE! He should have talked to me first"" and then.... The timing sequences were OK save the somewhat arbitrary plot tanglers that almost plagued this story like clockwork. BUT!!! The ending is always so much fun, and the final insults of retribution so well planned that you just can't help enjoy yourself to the point where the film almost redeems its self. As usually, it seems that Clooneys' Ocean has ever been calculating all possible angles to this objective that the ending satisfies anyones annoyance at paying taxes. The bad guy (Pacino) gets reamed, that's all that matters. Also, I have always been an Ellen Barkin fan. Even though the use of this woman is extremely limited in this film, does anyone know where I can get a pheromone injection like Damon uses during the latter part of this film? Again, not quite thumbs up, but definitely not thumbs down."

","Before watching the movie I saw one critic on TV talking about this movie very badly, in the end the interviewer asked him ""so is it bad or good?"" and the answer was ""It is not good enough for the money it is going to earn"" and I think he was spot on. Anyone going to this movie thinking of watching something new will be greatly disappointed, the movie was made with very clear cons which were also clearly explained by the actors from time to time, so you don't need to use your mind at any time during the movie, moreover the cons are stupid and unless you make yourself thinking at that level you will never find them believable. On the other hand the movie was lighthearted and there was some quite good jokes throughout which will be enjoyed if you somehow make your self think in the way the movie makers wanted you to think and if you have a big packet of popcorn in your hand."

Even though, you really need to check your disbelief at the door. Don't take it seriously. I know the casino tricks they did were not possible in the real world, but it was fun to see Al Pacino's character get his comeuppance. It was great to see all these stars together, and I feel they all got to be exposed with seemingly equal screen time. I liked Matt Damon's and Carl Reiner's characters the best. I felt they could have chosen a more appropriate actress than Ellen Barkin.<br/><br/>I don't really know the personalities of each member of the gang, nor their talents.

"jaredmobarak","7","1","2","18 June 2007"," Are you watching Oprah?Â…Ocean's 13
","Many people I have heard from plain despised Ocean's 12 when they saw it. They complained of its weak plot and unreal goofiness. However, I found it to be very entertaining despite all of that. What the first film had as far as intelligence and wit, the second had in cool and fun. Sure the story was far-fetched and convoluted, but I'd pay to see these guys having fun on screen anytime. I don't go to a film like this to be intellectually stimulated, I go to be entertained. What all this really boils down to is that I was looking forward to the third installment, appropriately named Ocean's 13, to see where these characters would go. Steven Soderbergh does not disappoint and, in fact, creates a nice mix of the first two movies. We are given a smartly orchestrated heist along with the great one-liners and facial expressions that made the second such a good time. I may say it is the best of the three, but if not it is at least as good as the first.<br/><br/>Once again revenge is paramount. Our crew's backer, wonderfully played by Elliot Gould per usual, has been double-crossed and bedridden by a heart attack as a result of another casino owner played by Al Pacino. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and their cohorts offer Pacino a peace offering, but once that is thrown in their faces, the movie starts hitting its stride. Stylistically you can't argue about the structure used to show the viewers how the plan will work. While trying to speak about a problem that needs fixing to a friend, Clooney and Pitt go through how everything will go down while we are visually shown the progress in each. This maneuver is at first a tad distracting, but once you get used to it you find how effective it was in getting a whole lot of info out in a short amount of time. The rest of the film then just leaves the boys to make sure the job gets done. There are pitfalls and unforeseen alliances that come into play, and of course comedy follows them all.<br/><br/>As with the first two films, especially the second, we have a lot of characters that just cannot get ample screen time to really be effective. It is not as noticeable here, though, because they are oftentimes on screen separately doing what they have to do rather than all together with only two of the group talking. Everyone gets a decent sized monologue or gimmick to show their stuff, and I'm sure all were satisfied as a result. You know these guys have to be having a ton of fun because with the sheer amount of talent involved, they can't be making too much money. Now with the addition of Pacino, who plays himself again like most films he has done in the past couple decades; Ellen Barkin, a tad over the top, but then she was drugged for most of it; David Paymer, in a funny bit part/running joke; and Eddie Izzard, somewhat underused here; the multitude of characters can be a bit overwhelming.<br/><br/>Overall it all worked for me. The plot twists are never too out there that you shake your head, many times you actually smile thinking that that was how it would be anyways. The filmmakers don't go out to confuse you, they just tell it how it has to happen and let the pieces fall into place. All the acting ends up being real good, maybe due in part to everyone having shortened time to not risk screwing up. My favorite is still the sarcastic banter and education void between Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. These two really have a great rapport with each other and every line out of their mouths is hilarious. Just watching them running through the halls of the casino when they have multiple tasks to accomplish made me laugh out loud."
"moutonbear25","7","1","2","16 June 2007"," Safe Hand
","I am a member of minority group. This group is made up of a small number of people who actually enjoyed OCEAN'S 12. Sure it was somewhat unbelievable and occasionally ridiculous but it kept a good groove on while filling the screen with some slick style. The boys all looked like they were having a good time, perhaps too good a time. Maybe audiences felt like they had taken it all too far; that the Ocean gang was having fun without them. And so, a director and a cast who generally don't seem to pay much heed to appeasing the masses, have returned to the original scene of the crime, Las Vegas, for their third and final caper in OCEAN'S 13. The main goal for this reunion is to make up for their supposed misfire last time out and every possible effort to do so is made diligently. With the exception of Julia Roberts, the original players have all returned. From Clooney to Pitt to Damon to Affleck (no, not that one, the younger one), the stars are all out. Even Al Pacino has come on board to lend more weight to this already heavy load. And with Mr. Style himself, Steven Soderbergh, at the helm, the dream is kept alive. So why then, with every element so perfectly placed, has the fun disappeared almost entirely?<br/><br/>Perhaps perfection is part of the problem. The Ocean gang is a smart bunch, crafty fellas. They are also often prone to making mistakes. The situations they find themselves in stem from their own decisions and almost always lead them to the brink of unraveling. The cracks they need to squeeze through get tighter and tighter, creating both intrigue and urgency for the viewer. OCEAN'S 13 finds Danny Ocean et al plotting sweet revenge against Willie Bank (Pacino) for putting Ocean member, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), in the hospital after screwing him out of a huge hotel/casino deal. The plan is to ruin his prestigious grand opening and milk him for hundreds of thousands of dollars all in one night. The execution is vast, ranging from rigging the dice at the source of manufacturing in Mexico to orchestrating an earthquake to disarm the stronghold security system that stands between them and the prize. Clearly, the good guys are going to win but never does it feel that there is a chance this might not happen. The urgency and intrigue were bet and lost.<br/><br/>Pacino is a welcome addition to the mix. His portrayal of hotel mogul, Willie Banks, is so sinister and egotistical that you can't wait for the Ocean boys to bring him down. However, while Pacino is stepping it up, Clooney and Pitt might as well have had their stand-ins play their parts. The camaraderie that brought such joy and laughs to the Ocean film experience in the past has grown tired. When the boys laugh now, it almost seems like the joke is on us; that getting us into the theatre with their pretty faces was all they were obliged to do. Once there, entertaining us was not part of their contract. These two haven't left it to just showing up for work in a while and the effect weighs you down. Luckily, Damon, Affleck, Scott Caan and Don Cheadle are still working for their paychecks, bringing wit, charm and humility to an often-lifeless script. Sadly, the sporadic laughs are not enough to call this film funny, or even fun for that matter.<br/><br/>So if OCEAN'S 13 isn't fun, what is it? Well, it's neatly packaged and pristinely presented. Soderbergh has a fantastic eye. He has a knack for crafting colorful films that are visual worlds unto themselves, which draw the viewer in to a point where the real world can look somewhat drab in comparison once you leave them. Only this time out, he spent too much time setting everything up that no room was left for error or chance. It's like a perfectly dealt hand that just isn't played with any finesse. It's ironic really how a film set against the gambling capital of the world takes so few risks. Soderbergh sets out to distract the audience with OCEAN'S 13, like any good casino would. With all the flashing lights, pretty colours and fireworks, you might not realize that you've been playing the slots for longer than you should."

","The latest OCEAN movie isn't exactly bad; in fact it is good. The OCEAN movies work on the basics i.e. character development, story telling stuff like that which never get outdated and are more often than not the surest way for a good movie. Add to that the talents of Clooney, Pitt and Damon helmed by Soderbergh and you have got more than what is necessary for a sure shot success formula. These movies work especially like one of those sitcoms where the charm of the characters makes even the silliest of jokes funny. Ditto here. Only that, the individual charm sure is intact but as a whole it is wearing thin.<br/><br/>******SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT********************************* The second one that was a party many felt uninvited to would be particularly satisfied as this one returns back to the formula of the first.Reuben decides to go straight in the casino business and in the process is deceived with his land and money by Vegas casino man Rudy Bank (Al Pacino). Reuben, losing all his money suffers an all but fatal heart attack. Rudy Bank was one of the people who shook hands with Frank Sinatra and now by duping Reuben has broken the code. Ocean and his crew gather around Reuben's death bed and decide to avenge him. How they do it and what are the odds to get even is OCEAN'S THIRTEEN. The performances are what drive a movie like this. George Clooney is right back after his rather uninspired turn in THE GOOD German. And back is the good old charm. One thing that always amazes me about Clooney is the impassive expression he so effortlessly draws out; every time he does that I just can't help laughing. And his chemistry with Pitt is as good as ever. Pitt is sleepwalking too, although neither the role nor his performance is as remarkable as the earlier two. Damon is as good as ever. The supporting members of the Ocean family all have their moments, especially Carl Reiner. As for Pacino, he is okay. Loud as he is nowadays, there isn't anything special about it. One interesting thing, Scott Caan gets to act in a movie alongside Pacino and his father James Caan was Sonny in THE GODFATHER. It is the premise that is the weak link in the chain. One was a decent caper, a self mocking one that knew where to be smart and where to be funny. The second one was just something else. But the third here lacks the smartness of the original and doesn't improve even half a notch in the fun aspect. I know it is supposed to be silly; in fact I like it for that. Caper movies that come across as serious are most often stupid. Movies like ENTRAPMENT are an insult to the intelligence of even the lowest common denominator among the audience. But here the silliness gets a bit too far. The radio controlled dice to rig the craps table is fine; I was okay with sending the Malloy brothers to Mexico. But what is with that earthquake machine. And I was most disappointed with how they decide to go for the actual diamonds on the rooftop. I mean, this is all they could come up with. Or are they taking their audiences for granted? This sure is not smart silliness, this is bordering on laziness. I know that Soderbergh and Clooney are running this franchisee for the sole purpose of bankrolling their artistic endeavors; THE GOOD German, SOLARIS. And make no mistake, I respect that, rather I support that. But don't take these audiences for granted. Next thing you know, the OCEAN movies are dead and buried. The fun aspect is right up there. This franchisee, being for the lowest commonest denominator among the audiences, is so funny its silliness might just be overlooked. Be it Clooney's expressions, impassive ones sometimes, be it Pitt eating and unleashing his charm, or Damon with his nose. I like how they called the nose ""Adrian""; guess you guys know who it referred to. And Reiner's shooting at Pacino was real funny, ""Hey, you're being conned out of everything and you just look at us like a fool."" ***********SPOILER END SPOILER END******************************* But still, there rings a feeling of disappointment. OCEAN'S THIRTEEN is no SPDIERMAN 3 or SHREK THE THIRD to fall flat on its face. Neither is AT WORLD'S END to be a fitting finale. It is like one of those sitcoms, say FRIENDS. The best seasons are funny and smart and that is what you would recommend to a first timer. But some of the stupidest seasons are the ones you would be less exuberant about. You would love them for sure; how could you not? You cannot hate them, but you know that deep down that it is being trash that is being served out. OCEAN'S THIRTEEN isn't trash; oh boy, it is very good. But I love the OCEAN movies and I love Danny, Rusty and Linus. But I am a wee bit less excited after watching this movie. Brad Pitt in an interview has said that they are gunning for the maximum sequels, with same stars; movies like ROCKY. Well Bernie Mac has an interesting line here that goes, ""You don't repeat the gag, you make a new one."" I guess they forgot to implement it this time around. If they intend to keep financing their artistic interests, please pay a lot more attention on the plot. And if you don't, please don't make a new one. Kills the life out of the other movies. I honestly say this, as a avid fan of Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Garcia, Soderbergh and the OCEAN movies; had it been any other movie with any other members, I sure would have shredded it to pieces. That says a lot about my two-faced fanboy integrity there."

","After the dullness of Spiderman 3, and the shipwreck that was Pirates 3, it was with much trepidation that I went to watch Ocean's Thirteen. The first (Clooney) film was frothy fun, the second an indulgent, over-stuffed turkey. Thankfully Soderbergh and THAT cast have returned to Vegas, pared back the tiresome romance aspects that so bogged down the second one (no Roberts, no Zeta-Jones), and upped the joke quantity and quality. Yes the plot is over-complicated and un-believable. Yes it is frequently preposterous, but you just don't care. There are quality jokes throughout this joppy jape, and are perfectly delivered by the cast - all of whom are at the top of their game. It is telling that Pacino - so often blasting his co-stars clean off the screen - is almost sidelined here. He's good, but a bit flat. Ditto for Barkin, who just can't do ditsy and sexy and professional and bitchy all at once, which is a shame because her scenes with Damon (also excellent) are great fun. Add in the terrific double act of Casey Affleck and Scott Caan (with a whole Mexican sub-plot to themselves that is hilarious), and the film is already on the up. More quality characterisation from Eddie Izzard, a nice expansion on Terry Benedict from Andy Garcia, and Carl Reiner delivering his usual class. But the dependable double act of Clooney and Pitt help keep the film whizzing on. Delivering quality lines and preposterous exposition with perfect deadpan faces and sublime timing (one word - Oprah!) it makes you wish they would make more movies together. Soderburgh shoots with his typical style and colourful eye and the film moves a decent clip. The best threequel of the year and second best 'Ocean' movie. Fun."

","In my preview for Ocean's 13, I said that the movie had all the makings to be more comparable to the 2001 Ocean's film than to the sequel, Ocean's 12. This definitely held true, but the film came nowhere close to being the great heist caper that was Ocean's 11.<br/><br/>The film was separated into two parts: the set-up of the con and the con itself. While the con was every bit as enjoyable as the original movie, the set-up leaves the audience wanting more. The gang's basic goal is to get revenge upon Willie Bank (Al Pacino) who screwed their friend Reuben (Elliott Gould) out of a casino partnership. The con is to basically rig every game in Bank's casino at the same instant so that he is left ruined.<br/><br/>While the con is pretty lame compared to the heist in the first movie, the lead in to the con is even lamer. Essentially, whenever there is a problem throughout the first half of the movie it is either solved by the gang spending a lot of money on something (like the drills used to build the Chunnel which they say cost about $36 million) or one character knowing a guy who could help them out. The end result is that the intricately planned heist in the first film is replaced by a string of bribes to employees at Bank's casino.<br/><br/>Furthermore, many of the members of the crew don't really do much to further the con at all. Clooney, Pitt, and Bernie Mac are around the entire movie, but never really do much of anything. Other characters were doing things, but none were as important to the con as they all were in the original.<br/><br/>Even still, when the gang enacts the con in the second half of the film (with all the people who they paid off), Soderbergh's direction and the cast's superb acting shines through all of the problems I had with the story to make for a really enjoyable finish. When I left the theater, I was incredibly satisfied with the movie because of its second half. Even though the con they were doing was pretty silly, they music, camera shots, and acting all came together with some fantastic dialogue to make a fun finish, simply lacking the suspense that the first movie had.<br/><br/>Where the second movie went wrong (the Julia Roberts scene) this movie succeeded. The actors remained cool throughout the ending, and it made for a very satisfactory experience. Soderbergh's goal was to recreate the Vegas feel that the first movie had, and he definitely succeeded during the sequence when the actual con takes place, leaving the viewer wanting more.<br/><br/>Overall, however, I give the movie 6.5/10 salty stix. With a more compelling con, the movie would have certainly been higher, but it was definitely more enjoyable than the Shrek and Pirates sequels which came before it this summer.<br/><br/>Google SaltyStix for more movie reviews and criticisms"

","I work for a research team who conduct top secret experiments for a government in Great Britain (obviously for security reasons I cannot disclose which Government). The subjects of our experiments are pretty much whatever the hell we decide to do and for our most recent experiment we decided to test the effects of a Soderberg film on the common household chimpanzee.<br/><br/>We decided a mother and child would be best and we selected the most maternal chimpanzee we had. We sat both chimps down and played oceans 13 on the monitor. During the first fifteen minutes they proceeded to defecate and throw faecal matter at the monitor, so far pretty standard behaviour for a chimpanzee and indeed any human being forced to watch the same movie, however as we reached the hour mark the infant defecated again but this time he proceeded to smear the monkey chocolate into his own eyes.<br/><br/>As we approached the 3 and a half hour mark the mother seemed to completely flip and started to bash the monitor as hard as she could which was unfortunate as she was using her child to hit it, over and over she pounded that little chimp into the screen until there was nothing left but a mass of blood, glass and little baby monkey pulp, it was a truly horrendous sight and I was reduced to tears (I had paid a fortune for that monitor, it was HD and everything). Suddenly the mother let out a bloodcurdling screech and dropped dead.<br/><br/>During the autopsy we discovered that all the major organs seemed fine except for the heart which was visibly broken leading to the conclusion that a mother would rather club her child to death than sit through oceans 13 regardless of how unbearable the loss of a child is.<br/><br/>Delighted with our results we decided to try some human testing and selected two male subjects both with the same IQ. Subject A was locked in a room and forced to watch Oceans 13 while subject B was locked in a room with nothing but a plain white wall to stare at.<br/><br/>Shortly after the movie began subject A was smearing his own leavings over the monitor exactly like the chimps. After the 5 hour running time had finished we conducted tests on both subjects, we took blood samples and discovered that subject A's blood contained 75% more boredom than subject B's and whilst subject B's IQ remained the same subject A's IQ had dropped by 50% thus proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that watching a Steven Soderberg film does in fact make you dumber.<br/><br/>On a side note, 3 months after the experiment subject A was diagnosed with aids. We are not saying that you can catch aids by watching Oceans 13 but if you absolutely must watch it then please be careful."

","Well firstly, i've seen both of the previous movies and even though i don't think its a huge problem if you hadn't have done, i would have thought most people who would go and see Ocean's Thirteen would have seen the others! After having been a little disappointed with the second instalment and with so many prequels already released this year (ie. spider-man, pirates of the caribbean, shrek) getting mediocre (if that) reviews, i wasn't honestly expecting too much from this! However, i'm happy to announce that this was definitely better than Ocean's Twelve and even though not quite upto the original, it was definitely the film i have enjoyed the most so far out of the big prequels (mainly spider-man & pirates)! One major good point, which is the downfall of many of these big movies is that Ocean's Thirteen is not TOO long and doesn't drag on! Its got a good plot which uses all of the well-known characters in the best way (even though i would've liked to have seen abit more acrobatic stuff from the little Chinese guy) and its funny in all the right places! Witty, but not pathetically pointless! Again, its very clever with all of the gadgets they use in their plan and it kept moving which is what i hate most about certain films! Great cast, great acting and Matt Damons nose is hilarious!! Definitely worth a watch and deserves to do well! This is one film where the third outing hasn't been a let-down, so lets hope there are many more good sequels/prequels!"

","Well once again Danny Ocean(George Clooney) is back again for round three another casino caper that's full of star power as Clooney again is joined by all-stars Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, and Elliot Gould with this time the story centers around the con of Vegas casino owner Willy Bank(Al Pacino). A new Vegas casino has just opened and Willy Bank who's played perfect by legend Pacino feels good with his right hand lady Abigail(the still hot and sexy Ellen Barkin) yet, Willy hasn't realized he's playing with professionals and revenge is in store, because he had just recently double crossed Reuben(Elliot Gould) out of casino ownership. This time though Danny and his rat pack of boys have new methods and ways to over throw the casino it's mostly the mastermind and manipulation of computers, and the reprogramming of slot machines, and the use of high tech cameras, to the engineering of an earthquake, and manipulation of lie detector testing, to the use of cologne as an aphrodisiac, now that's just to name a few! Really a tribute to the ways that digital technology can be used! And the film is full of plenty of witty lines, and the characters take on their own fake identities even though the plot reveals little about their life in as of a social aspect. Just to mention it was nice to once again see Ellen Barkin and Al Pacino team up again, just remember 1989's beauty ""Sea of Love"". Overall a pretty good film with plenty of star power, fun, wit, and jolly fun to make it interesting as a commercial success and it was surely better than ""Ocean's Twelve""."

","I saw this last night, and I was thoroughly pleased and enjoyed myself for the entirety of the film. The camera/shooting kept true with the first of the Ocean's movies, and was very pleasing to see the story unfold. I was a bit disappointed with the way the story went because it didn't contain as much suspense as Ocean's Eleven, but I suppose this is due to the 'double-cross/revenge' type storyline. I was very pleased with the little gibs of humor dispersed throughout the entire movie, just like the first two, and this kept my interest the entire time. I was very glad to see all of the characters come back and play their roles once more, and Al Pacino doing a great job with his part. Overall, I'd say that it was definitely worth the $9.50 I paid to get in and see the movie. There was some room for improvement, but I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie. Enormously enjoyed."

I picked up on the fact that screen writers used two important lines from the Godfather. The settings for the movie were beautiful. Banks casino was even for Vegas dare I say it over the top. The inclusion of Oprah in the movie was good to. However, I felt Andy Garcia performance was forced. He was not the cool casino owner in the previous two but seemed to be bumbling. I liked how they handled that fact that tess was not in the movie. Also, Ellen Barkin and Al Pacino must have made nice. For them to be in the same movie as well as the same scene was a real milestone. There was a very personal war between the two actors over a custody fight years ago. Anyway, it was a nice way to end the series."
"acrosstheriverbend","8","2","8","9 June 2007"," Ocean's Thirteen: an actually decent 3-quel
","After Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Shrek the Third proved to be disappointing, I lowered my expectations for Ocean's 13 by, well, a lot. Maybe that was a good thing- especially after the scathing review in Time magazine. So when I saw the movie on Friday night, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I already can't recall much of the plot. It was complicated. Like Pirates, the Oceans movies just seem to keep getting more confusing and slicker. Basically, Reuben (Gould) makes a deal with Willie Bank ( a really tan and orange-y Pacino), a sneaky and scheming casino owner. Danny (Clooney) tries to talk Reuben out of it, but Reuben doesn't listen and Bank screws him over, leaving him with nothing. Reuben goes into shock and winds up with this weird medical condition, kind of like a stroke or coma or something. The entire crew wants him to get back to being himself, and they decide that Bank has to pay. The scheme: sabotage the opening of Bank's casino. They want him to hurt- no, devastate- his ego, making him lose millions during the Grand Opening and not get the Five Diamond Award. Sounds simple enough- until they consider the security. This is where you get lost. The crew basically has to combat this super security system and they have to cause a virtual earthquake to shut down the power, trick the dice, fix all of the games, fix some of the slots, seduce Bank's right-hand women (Barkin), and practically torture a poor hotel reviewer. Oh, and then when they need around $36 million to fund the earthquake, Linus (Damon) suggests turning to, yes, Terry Benedict (Garcia).<br/><br/>So that's basically what happens. And in the end, it works. Sometimes the plot drags and is slow, but most of the time you're completely hooked (or at least I was). There are some really funny moments, like when Rusty and Danny watch Oprah. This movie is definitely more like the first one concerning style and things like that. The Las Vegas vibe adds so much to the movies and the plot focuses more on the other guys, not just Danny, Rusty, and Linus. I don't think there was enough of Basher, but there was this great scene with him and Banks. And the Mormon twins were excellent. They were hysterical, and even a Mexican subplot works. The acting was pretty good overall, and they clearly weren't trying too hard. (By the way, Tess and Isabel (from Ocean's 12). When I heard about this at first, I was worried. But during the movie, you don't really miss them.) The only thing that irked me was some of the filming. Sometimes the camera was moving too much or they had the split screen and it was dizzying. And everything seemed to have like, I don't know, an orange-y glow. It was very slick, and not always in a good way. <br/><br/>Ocean's Thirteen is a nice, shiny package. Yes, it's a little flamboyant, over-the-top, and silly, but it's so much fun. You can tell everyone had a great time during filming- the energy comes through the screen, something that was lacking in Twelve. Don't except too much from it or take it to seriously. The movie is simply a fun summer treat."

","The movie had a lotta expectation --- but as far as i'm concerned it didn't live up to it. Steven did a very nice job directing but it was not as good as the first part. The spark which was there in the first part is absent. All the planning and execution has been filmed with exceptional brilliance. As usual, Steven scores in that. But... an actor of Al Pacino's caliber has been wasted. He didn't have much to do except sit back let everything happen---especially when he was introduced as such a rude n crude person. The comedy plays a very very important part---the spontaneous dialogue delivery from george clooney and brad pitt are still good and i'd say its even better...Overall, the movie is an excellent entertainer---its a little disappointing only because of the image created by the previous 2 versions...

","Anyone who has ever seen Ocean's Twelve know right off, if there is a sequel, it's going to be fun and intricate, if not as down right complex. Thus it is with this third installment. Danny Ocean's friend Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) who believed he was 'in the know' with his partner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) and expecting to make a fortune, learns' he is not only fired, but is thrown out of the Casino business. When Tishkoff's friends appeal to Bank, he's not only disinterested, but reminds them he is too powerful to be hurt. The challenge is accepted and Ocean (George Clooney) and his team Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Carl Reiner design a plan to separate $500 million dollars from Bank and his casino. The drawbacks are enormous as added to the mix is an arch-enemy of Banks', a powerful insider named Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). He is a vengeful sore loser who dislikes Banks and promises trouble for Ocean and his men if they are unsuccessful. They movie is top heavy with star power including Eddy Lizzard, the British Comedian. Every audience member must stay focused on the characters, the multi-staged plan and expected double crosses as this is a fast paced film crowded with counter plans and Casino like excitement where anyone can win at any moment.

","Back in 2001, Steven Soderbergh's slick, stylish, super-cool remake of the 1960 Rat-Pack heist film, 'Ocean's Eleven,' became one of the surprise critical hits of the the year. Featuring a stellar ensemble cast, the film's clever and exciting take on a modern-day Las Vegas casino heist left audiences wanting more. Three years later, Soderbergh and most of the cast returned for the long-awaited sequel, though 'Ocean's Twelve' ultimately failed to deliver the goods. Whilst it was certainly enjoyable to watch  and everybody involved seemed to be having fun  the script was poorly-developed and uninvolving, containing numerous moments requiring significant suspension of disbelief, particularly where Julia Roberts' character was concerned. Fortunately, with 'Ocean's Thirteen,' the filmmakers have returned to what made the first film so unbelievably entertaining: a selection of Hollywood's biggest stars having a crack at the impossible casino caper.<br/><br/>Whilst the film has shed the two female stars from the previous film  Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones  the male cast has remained relatively unchanged, with acting veteran Al Pacino thrown in for good measure. This decision allowed for the removal of any clunky love stories from the storyline, keeping the writers (Brian Koppelman and David Levien, both new to the franchise) focused on what is important to the plot. It also allows for some highly amusing man-to-man banter between Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) about the troubles of relationships, the best one featuring Rusty's quirky pancake anecdote. The plot of the film is perhaps more elaborate than you might expect (you could easily lose track of some elements of the story if you're not paying attention), but each of the actors looks as though they are enjoying themselves, and, ultimately, we're enjoying it as well.<br/><br/>The film begins when one of Danny's original team  mentor and father-figure, Rueben (Elliott Gould)  suffers a heart attack after being betrayed in a business deal by the ruthless, scheming casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino). Thirsting for revenge, Danny rallies his loyal troops, and they set about shattering Banks' hopes and dreams on the opening night of his slick and expensive new casino, The Bank. It doesn't matter if the team wins any money, as long as Bank loses out. Danny and his men hatch an extravagant plan to get their retribution, and success will depend entirely on their own resourcefulness and cunning. What are the odds of getting even? Thirteen to one.<br/><br/>George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner Forgive me for being repetitive, but that is one hell of a cast! Each of the actors understands that the film works best when the characters don't take themselves too seriously, and so their laid-back approach makes their exploits twice as enjoyable. The snappy script is jam-packed with highly-quotable one-liners, and George Clooney, in particular, relishes his sparkling dialogue, delivering it with the suaveness of an Ian Fleming character. Watch out for two clear stand-out scenes in the film: the first featuring a worker's strike at a dice factory in Mexico, and the second involving a very unique episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. All in all, 'Ocean's Thirteen' is a very entertaining thumbs up."

","I loved Oceans 11 when it was released. It was slick, funny, entertaining, had a fantastic original script and had a huge A list cast.<br/><br/>I hated Oceans 12. It had all the things mentioned above with the addition of Catherine Zeta Jones and an embarrassing Bruce Willis cameo. The problems with Oceans 12 is that it had all the ingredients as Oceans 11 but got so caught up in its on self importance and fame and ultimately became so bloated with stars and in jokes it became a mess.<br/><br/>I didn't want to see Oceans 13 but after some promising reviews and good trailers, there I was on opening night.<br/><br/>Gone are Catherine Zeta Jones and Julia Roberts as Oceans 13 was not their fight. This was the correct decision, their inclusion in the movie would have been unnecessary.<br/><br/>Plot Not overly complicated. Reuben gets screwed around by Bank over the opening of a new casino so Danny, Rusty and the gang vow to get revenge by ruining Bank financially and so it begins.<br/><br/>They set out to ruin opening night by fixing all the machines etc to pay out big money. Their plan is foiled by the discovery of a computer inside the casino that can tell if you are cheating or if you know that you are going to win. This is a nice touch and it was fun and interesting to watch how the gang would get around this problem - although there was never any doubt that they would.<br/><br/>Cast All of the original 11 had returned. They are a great ensemble cast and all work so well together. This time we get even more of Turk and Virgil (my favs) and even less of Bernie Mac so I was happy. <br/><br/>Virgils trip to Mexico to rig the dices as they were being made only to start a protest and get the factory shut down was funny, was made even funnier by Turk going to sort him out and joining in the riot. Virgil and Turk are so great - they should have their own spin off! lol<br/><br/>You can tell the Damon, Clooney and Pitt are all buddies in real life they all just work so well together.<br/><br/>It was a nice touch that in scenes with just Clooney and Pitt we cut to them in mid conversation which turned out to be pretty funny as we had no idea what they were on about!<br/><br/>Ellen Barkin was OK in the role she was given. - nothing much to say about her role at all.<br/><br/>Matt Damons nose was great and it was apparently not a prop for props sake. Apparently a big nose is still good for a few laughs in today's sophisticated age!! A little cameo from his characters father at the end was a nice touch<br/><br/>Terry Benidicate was back in a small role which was nice as he is a fun character. Seeing him on Oprah - a long running joke through the film was funny!<br/><br/>Best Line This would have to go to Rueben. I cannot remember the full line which I am really annoyed at, but when he is in bed speaking for the first time and he gives of a list of comments and ends with ""Linus crying"" = very funny<br/><br/>Honourable mention must go to Turk and Virgil Turk - Is it in yet? Virgil - I hate that question!<br/><br/>Payoff There was never any doubt that Oceans11 were going were going to succeed in their plan but watching them pull it of was a fun journey!<br/><br/>Overall This film was so much better than Oceans 12. I am glad that they left out CJZ and J.R, but I am not saying that they are the reason for Oceans 12 being the weakest of the three no no no .<br/><br/>I would give it 7/10. It loses a two points for being the third movie (one point lost for each sequel). This is because Oceans 11 was never meant to be a franchise - Oceans 11 wasn't made with sequel in mind.<br/><br/>It also loses a point for the cheesy in jokes at the end - Clooney telling Rusty to go have a couple of kids, Pitt telling Clooney not to put on so much weight in between and Damon for saying I will see you when I see you.<br/><br/>There is a slight chance that we will see Oceans 14. It is necessary? No. It is needed ? No. Will I see it? Yes."

"classicalsteve","6","1","3","11 June 2007"," More Stars and Gadgets Do Not a Better Movie Make
","In another era, this is the kind of studio-made Hollywood movie where you would expect to have little boxes of the stars on the official poster, á la many-a murder mystery or disaster flick of the 1970's. (If you're not familiar with this, check out the original posters of movies like ""The Towering Inferno"" or the Agatha Christie murder mystery of your choice, like ""The Mirror Crack'd"".) I once read there was a tendency for such movies to be marginal. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is certainly a decent two-hour escape and you will get your money's worth. And even a bit or two is worth the price of admission. But within this escapist entertainment movie was probably a better movie wanting to come out. More stars and more gadgets do not necessarily a-better-movie-make.<br/><br/>Essentially the plot is simple. Al Pacino, magnificently cast as the no-holds-barred Godfather of Vegas, double-crosses and then strips casino-investor Elliot Gould of his money and his dignity. Pacino already owns a half-dozen or so other casinos, and he does this just for spite. I guess it's personal. Not very healthy for Gould who lapses into a coma. Pacino is not just corrupt, he's not just a thief, he's the kind of son-of-a-bitch who would sell his own mother down the creek for a big win at the Black Jack table. So what else is new? That's what casino owners are. The only thing Pacino doesn't know is that Gould is friends with Danny Ocean (George Cloony) and his gang of casino-busters (Pitt, Damon, Cheadle et al). Right away we learn this is a revenge movie as a motivation for the heist.<br/><br/>There are a few bits that will stay with you, particularly Matt Damon playing Linus Caldwell playing the lackey of a supposed Chinese Billionaire, Dr Weng, played by Shaobo Qin out to put 10 million on a single play. Damon's nose alone is worth the price of admission as he attempts to seduce Pacino's wife, played by Ellen Barkin. And the reason that Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict (the ""victim"" of the first movie) is brought back into the action is just the kind of reason you want and expect from your rival casino magnate. Another side plot is a casino-reviewer played by David Paymer who is shown a ""good time"" at the hands of Ocean's gang. This bit is also priceless.<br/><br/>The challenge with Caper Movies is that to work they have to have a certain amount of believability. In other words, the minute you start thinking, ""Oh, come on"", the suspension of disbelief starts to sink back to the ground. There were a few too many moments when I thought the busters were trying to solve unsolvable problems with budgets approaching the funding for NASA. There are more gadgets in this movie than in a Julia Child cooking show. Everything from dice-manipulators, rigged slot machines, to a tunnel-boring machine the likes of which was used to create the famous ""chunnel"" between England and France. One of those only cost 30 million. Peanuts for these guys. <br/><br/>But it doesn't end with the thieves as rip-off-artists. The casino has the highest-state-of-the-art security system in which each patron is tracked for blood-pressure, heart-rate, cholesterol level, metabolic rate, financial standing, hobbies, and sexual orientation. Apparently, if a winner really is surprised, then thats on the level. If the winner acts like they were expecting to win, then I guess they're hauled in and beaten by the security guards. Seemed a bit off the charts, so to speak. If the robbers have a budget approaching NASA, the casino has a budget rivaling the US defense department. So the gang of casino-busters has to break through this digital-wonder of computer surveillance without their faces and heart-rates appearing on the read-out screens of the surveillance team while ripping millions off the casino. No problem, I guess, if you have 50 million to spend.<br/><br/>Where the story suffers is its characters and the number of gadgets. Maybe there are just too many of them. Not only does each character have a little ""story"" but all the gadgets seem to have stories too, and none get too much development. Don Cheadle hangs around the tunnel-boring machine but seems to do little else. Shaobo Qin as the athlete who also ""plays"" Dr Weng is never given much screen time, and yet that seemed to have huge potential for some great humor. Brad Pitt in some ways seems the most cliché of the bunch, playing a Vegas hunk, considering he is currently Hollywood's hunk. His only good moment is at the very opening of the film. There's also a strike going on at a Mexican dice manufacturing plant that's never quite fully explained.<br/><br/>The comedic standout performances were by Matt Damon and Ellen Barkin, and you'll just have to see it to understand why. Their ""chemistry"" kind of worked for some reason. Look for the nose.<br/><br/>The gadgets are certainly fun, and the moments mentioned above are worth the $10 ticket + $20 for popcorn, munchies and soft drinks. Certainly a great choice for a first-date as it's fun and you don't have to think. But it gets to be a bit too congested for its own good: too many characters, too many gadgets and too many side-plots. The characters are never really developed enough to give you a sense of why they are doing this. Maybe Ocean's 10 might have been a better more focused film."
"vsp","7","1","3","10 June 2007"," Somewhere in between Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve
","Ocean's Eleven was a splendid movie, in which the gang has invented the most ingenious heist ever. In Ocean's Twelve the heist was actually a fist fight in a train, which cleverly mocked the first part. What makes both movies similar is the fact that they both have a script with a climax and a plot twist which is actually the nicest part in a movie of that kind.<br/><br/>This is actually what disappointed me in Ocean's Thirteen. It has no climax and no plot twist. There are many small tricks that are taking place on screen, and the movie creates a feeling of complexity not because there is something really complex, but because there are many things to follow and keep in mind at the same time. And this is the only major drawback of Ocean's Thirteen  the linear and steady development of the story, with no ""jumpy"" parts.<br/><br/>Leaving this behind, the movie is great. The humor is very clever and also wins the audience with the fact that it is trying to be different from the previous parts and to integrate more complex and fresh jokes, which is something not many films manage to do. All the actors are as good as they always were  worthy of watching over and over, the atmosphere is nice and relaxing. <br/><br/>On the whole, the last part of trilogy is worthy of standing proud next to its two older brothers... or sisters."
"screenwriter-14","7","1","3","9 June 2007"," ""Nose played"", right?? Or, wrong??
","OCEANS 13 is NOT THE BEST film of Summer 2007 and despite the tremendous cast, the story seems old, another ""hotel heist"" in Vegas with top name actors strutting their stuff across the strip. Act One also takes a long time to set up, and by the middle of Act Two, the film begins to pick up and become more exciting and interesting. The film is a great ""frat boy"" flick, because basically frat boys can watch themselves on the screen and nudge each other with, ""awesome, dude"". Sorry, but I loved the first OCEANS, the rest just seem like repeats of the first.<br/><br/>However, Elliott Gould is marvelous, with a subtle performance that is fun to watch envelope on the screen, George Clooney superb, as usual, and the rest of the cast do their thing. But, let's put OCEANS out to pasture and come up with the cast in something fresher, away from the glitter and glut of Las Vegas."
"DICK STEEL","8","2","11","9 June 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Ocean's Thirteen
","13 is not an unlucky number for this Steven Soderbergh directed franchise. With many a blockbuster presenting their third installments this summer - Spider-Man, Pirates of the Caribbean, Shrek, Bourne and the likes, Ocean's 13 bested those that have already gone before, with something light and breezy, although rehashing the tried and tested formula employed in Ocean's Eleven.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed heist movies, and Ocean's Eleven was a very smart one at that, given the bonus of having assembled some of the top names in Hollywood and having some of them play second fiddle. It was thoroughly fun, and I thought it had a very smart exit strategy. Ocean's Twelve however was a little flat, as the ending was a bit of a cop out, and didn't really excite with its smart alecky narration finale. The only memorable events from Ocean's Twelve were Bruce Willis and how Arsenal football club was weaved into the proceedings.<br/><br/>Ocean's 13 leaves behind Europe and returns to where the action started, back to Vegas, where Willie Bank (Al Pacino), the most unscrupulous man on the strip, plays out Reuben (Elliott Gould) of their joint casino hotel The Midas - now renamed The Bank hotel, and causes the latter to suffer from a stroke. The rest of the Ocean gang, led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) are mad, and congregate back in Las Vegas to seek revenge the best way they know how - to steal and to humiliate Bank on the opening night of his new casino.<br/><br/>And we welcome back the friends we know from the previous two movies, with Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan the right hand man, who also opened this movie as he did the previous installment, Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, who is looking to break out of the shadows of Danny and Rusty to prove his worth, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Qin Shaobo the kungfu kid, Casey Affleck, Scott Cann, Carl Reiner and Eddie Izzard. There's no Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones, both of whom were written out of the movie early, between conversational pieces of Danny and Rusty. Gone are the two leading ladies, only to be replaced by a very wrinkled Ellen Barkin as Abigail Sponder, the personal assistant to Bank.<br/><br/>The chemistry amongst the thieving team remains intact, as once again we experience the camaraderie amongst the sarcasm and wit, with the banter between Danny and Rusty being pure gold, especially their final exchange with real life references. However, the scene stealer here (the other contender being Carl Reiner's absolutely hilarious role) is definitely Matt Damon. Still wanting to get into the thick of the action, and ever ready to volunteer for key roles, his Linus Caldwell is a hoot to watch, especially when he goes under disguise. A far departure from his more serious roles, like the upcoming Bourne Ultimatum (also the concluding part of the franchise), he fits that mummy's / daddy's boy figure to a T.<br/><br/>While we get to return to the Bellagio, and with spanners thrown into our jolly men's plans, Ocean's Thirteen does feel a little dragged out. The structure's the same, with the middle part hinging on the setting up of the elaborate plan, leaving the final moments for the execution and the exit strategy with a twist. Sometimes having too much of a good thing do make the pace a little wonky. There's nothing really new to expect, except that Soderbergh actually went a step ahead and pulled the rug from under the audience's feet, and it's a clever little rouse involving the trailers you see for the movie. Now that's pure gem.<br/><br/>What should put bum onto the seats will be the return of familiar faces into the roles, and in all honesty, a franchise episode that actually feels refreshed."
"tburke85","8","1","4","18 June 2009"," Oceans Thirteen Better But Still With Some Flaws
","Ocean's Thirteen is better than the other one but still with some flaws fortunately the good outweighs the bad. The all star ensemble cast are all terrific in reprising their roles including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Rob Reiner, Eddie Jamison, and Elliot Guild. Al Pacino joins the cast and he does a good job with his villain role in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are solid in their roles as well. Like the other ones it's better to see Ocean Thirteen without knowing too much about the movie. The pacing was slow at times again and the film still seemed to be juggling to many characters with a few reprising their roles from the past films who only make brief appearances but all of them are effective in their very limited screen time none the less. Ocean's Thirteen despite it's flaws is a solid caper movie much better than some other ones out there. Overall Ocean's Twelve has humor, drama, excitement, surprises, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this third entry in the series worth the time to watch."
"Critical Eye UK","10","1","4","29 November 2007"," Take the money. And run with the research.
","Here's a great example of Hollywood with a heart! A bunch of multi-millionaire actors get together with a director friend to fund vital research into Extreme Attention Deficit Syndrome!!!<br/><br/>Well, yes.<br/><br/>Though ADS is very distressing, in this, its most severe form, Extreme victims are unable to concentrate for more than 10 seconds. Are incapable of following any kind of discussion. And cannot remember anything of a sequential nature because by the time it reaches Z, they have no recollection of A to Y.<br/><br/>The total number of Extreme ADS sufferers is unknown, and so the true scale of this tragedy has been impossible to determine. Until now.<br/><br/>Ocean's 13, the project put together by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Steven Soderbergh, Al Pacino, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Andy Garcia, Oprah Winfrey, Shae Wilson and a supporting cast and crew of thousands, represents the biggest investment ever made into this field of medical research.<br/><br/>Presented in the guise of ""a movie"", it discards the usual conventions of credibility, coherence, wit and originality, and instead prescribes a narrative arc that starts, and finishes, at A.<br/><br/>Nothing in Ocean's 13 makes any sense at all because there is no requirement for it to make sense. The requirement is, instead, to identify the extent of Extreme ADS.<br/><br/>In its original form, Ocean's 13 called for God (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) to be a failed interior decorator friend of the pseudonymous Ocean (Clooney).<br/><br/>God is prevailed upon to visit a plague of locusts on a new Las Vegas casino run almost single-handedly by its owner (Pacino) in an act of revenge for Pacino's thuggish treatment of another of Ocean's friends (Elliott Gould.) The locusts are there to eat all the guests arriving on the casino's opening night. When they've finished, the building is to be toppled by a localised earthquake and then washed away by a Great Flood (localised, of course) this being a Clever Visual Pun on the word 'Ocean'.<br/><br/>Too clever though for Extreme ADS victims.<br/><br/>A good thing, then, that this screenplay was junked on the grounds of credibility: Las Vegas is known to be Godless, so even Extreme ADS sufferers would be unable to accept that narrative proposition.<br/><br/>To make it more credible, then, the rewritten script has Ocean and his friends purchase the world's largest tunnelling machine (last seen in action under the English Channel) which they set up on The Strip whilst nobody notices and then burrow under the earth so as to cause enough vibrations to slightly perturb Mr Pacino's building and cause a few things to wobble and fall over.<br/><br/>Obviously, Irwin Allen this ain't: the special effects cost less than the gravy mix applied to Mr Pacino's face by way of ironic comment on Western contemporary Society's obsession with the cosmetic rather than the meaningful.<br/><br/>(Note: this aspect of the ""story"" was always going to escape Extreme ADS sufferers. But to be fair, it was put in for the benefit of their carers.)<br/><br/>Ocean's friends also recruit a Morecambe & Wise fan (who they?) played by Eddie Izzard (who he?) together with a variety of others whose talents embrace everything other than an ability to act.<br/><br/>There's someone in Mexico who makes or does not make dice. A man who owns Samsung. An FBI man with acute laryngitis. A man who is arrested and is happy. A man who is arrested and is sad. A man who is British and Does Something. A Man Who Is Not British And Does Something. Another Man Who Does Something Else. A Man Who Has Nothing To Do With Anything. An Oprah Winfrey. And Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>There's also Ellen Barkin, re-united with Al Pacino all these years after Sea of Love. Which was a movie. But of which, of course, Extreme ADS sufferers possess neither knowledge nor memory. After surviving Sea of Love, Ms Barkin here drowns her career in Clooney's Ocean.<br/><br/>The esteemed director Soderbergh is there to ensure that everything is as dysfunctional as its intended audience.<br/><br/>He succeeds handsomely: Ocean's 13 flits from scene to scene with neither logic nor explanation (albeit this again has a deeper meaning: a comment on the way so much of America's mainstream movie output is merely the same pack of shuffled cards set down in a different order without ever adding up to a satisfying hand.<br/><br/>(Well, you know where you are with Soderbergh. The intellectual thrust is never absent from his work, and Las Vegas was always going to be too tempting a subject to resist.) And so Ocean's 13 goes on. And on. And on.<br/><br/>Simple humour abounds, of course, as it must: Extreme ADS victims cannot comprehend anything complicated. Thus, Al Pacino's money-mad criminal is called Mr Bank.<br/><br/>It's a type of rarified comedy that is particularly exemplified in Cheadle's performance, a career-sacrificing turn of unequalled nobility. Though then again, there is Ellen Barkin. Al Pacino. And Clooney. And Pitt.<br/><br/>So the question has to be: just how successful is Ocean's 13 as a medical research project?<br/><br/>The signs are certainly good: it doesn't take long to identify the existence of Extreme ADS in the reviews of those so inattentive that they actually thought this was a movie.<br/><br/>And yes: that's very, very sad.<br/><br/>Hopefully though, treatment will be along soon.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Ocean's 13: a landmark in international medical research. 10/10 plus a bonus point for the late Cary Grant.<br/><br/>You Know It Makes Sense."

","Silly, over-indulgent fun with a great cast and crazy storyline.<br/><br/>The Cast in Ocean's 11 was spectacular. To add Al Pacino in the mix makes it even more spectacular. The departure of Julia Roberts makes it even more fun.<br/><br/>This time it's not for money...it's for revenge...and money. Lot's of silly humour, funny dialogue and bad acting. Perfect! The director and actors try to remind you that this is a film and as such none of them take any of it seriously. However this has the effect of putting a smile on your face and adopt a ""just go with it"" attitude.<br/><br/>Clooney and Pitt don't put any effort at all into their performances, they might as well be sitting on their couch at home scratching their nuts. But neither did Dino and Sinatra. But the chemistry between them is amazing. The final scene sees them making fun of George's real life bachelorhood and Pitt's real life Kid-fostering obsession with Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>A noteworthy performance from Andy Garcia, who usually doesn't do ""Hollywood"" movies. He joins Pacino on screen again for the first time since Godfather 3, although they don't share any screen time together.<br/><br/>The one who steals the show is Matt Damon, Look out for him trying to seduce Elen Barkin.<br/><br/>See this movie, it's great fun and reminds you that cheesiness done properly is fantastic."
"shadowman123","8","1","4","16 July 2007"," Keeps on impressing!
","The exploits of Danny Ocean and crew are something you will either love or loathe. Asides from the first movie which was what I felt Luke warm Oceans 12 really did impress me with its wise cracks and story line which leads to a perfect warm up for this third instalment. Danny Oceans mentor and team member Ruben has been screwed out of a deal with a ruthless Willie Banks (played by Al Pacino) the team take it upon them-selves to teach him that when you cross one Ocean! you cross them all! This Danny and the team leave the stylish Hustle-like format out and pull out all the stops with everybody who owes them. What I liked about this movie was that it shows almost a mission impossible layout of getting in and getting out with no little surprises up their sleeves. The film still has its funny moments which are great and gives it that charm but this time EVERYBODY has their part to play in the heist a bit like in the first movie. Again my only complaint with O13 was that although it tries to keep a serious tone to it at times with the fact what Ruben means to the team and leaving the wives and girl-friends at home it still pretty much fails to connect on an emotional level but you'll just have to take it for the sake of entertainment and trying to fill in a few gaps. Clooney,Pitt and Damon were again all in fine form but I felt that extra kudos should of gone to Don Cheadle this time (although his cockney English accent still sucked). Al Pacino was brilliant as always as Willie Banks and we certainly can't miss out Ellen Berkin (I need to find what was the name of that perfume!). To conclude Oceans 13 is one of those movies that you just watch for the sake of entertainment, nothing to lose nor gain but having said that I liked that fact that it was not as hyped as much as its predecessor due to the fact that films like Spider-man 3 just aimed too high and delivered not all that much but on the whole this one kept me happy and I would walk away saying I would like to see another one !<br/><br/>OCEANS 13 : 8.1 OUT 10<br/><br/>WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF GETTING EVEN ?

Danny calls the crew back to action to seek revenge against Bank and his new lavish Vegas Casino which is geared towards ""whales."" The plan is to cost the casino over $500 million in just under four minutes, effectively ruining Bank's career.<br/><br/>The story is convoluted and ridiculous at best, but we don't care. All three Ocean's films have been set in a world of wacky unrealistic elaborate situations, which require the right character to be in the right place if something unplanned happens. But again, we don't really care.<br/><br/>Sure, the stars were back, but gone was the stylized crazy story that made the first film so much fun. In my opinion the problem was that they uplifted the characters and placed them in a whole new setting.

I don't think so personally.<br/><br/>A brief introduction of the new villain this time around shows him as an evil man. But for some people (a friend of mine in particular) he wasn't evil enough ... I can see why he says that, because Al plays it a bit more subtle than Andy G. did in the first movie. Still Al is phenomenal in my book, including this movie!

","'Ocean's 13' is the first of the trilogy I have seen, so can't comment on whether it is any better than 12 or 11. I am familiar with the original Sinatra/Rat Pack movie, and 'Ocean's 13' certainly nods back to that. ""You shook Sinatra's hand. You should know better"" is a payoff line near the end.<br/><br/>Plot? Well, a Casino gets scammed. Big time. You do have to understand how blackjack, roulette, etc work to start with to appreciate the intricacies of the sting (and I got lost now and then), but the ideas are audacious and inventive, and fun.<br/><br/>Our villain this time is Al Pacino, looking rather orange and playing nasty with relish. His sidekick is the purring and flighty Ellen Barkin, all pouts and wiggles like an ageing Marilyn Monroe. Amongst the heroes, the gang who pull off the scam, are George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Eddie Izzard (absolutely atrocious acting), and more.<br/><br/>Performances are generally OK. Effects, especially an earthquake, are well-done. In-jokes and laughs are there too, and the film fairly drips with the Hollywood gloss polished all over it.<br/><br/>'Ocean's 13' is OK. It's probably worth your time to spend a couple of hours in the cinema if that's your thing. It is formulaic and does what it says on the tin. There's no tension or doubts, really, but a slightly muddled ending lets it down a bit. I'd rate it average."
"jzappa","8","1","4","18 June 2007"," I Hate Nines
","I frankly think that audiences walk in with the exact opposite attitude towards the Ocean's films than the one I walk in with. Those who don't like them seem to come out with such a tainted look at everything, like even the best parts of the film are actually flaws. The people who like them seem to come out thinking that they've just seen a cute little romp devised as nothing more than a cash register by and for the millionaires starring in and making it. These people aren't wrong, but there is definitely a difference between Hollywood gloss with the mushy brain of an adolescent pyromaniac and that with the imagination of truly talented screenwriters.<br/><br/>Ocean's Thirteen, like the first two, is my kind of film, a slick, elaborate caper with hues of revenge and a dryly ditzy sense of humor. If this is your kind of film too, then sit back, and just be mutable with the problematic inconsistencies, my friend. The heist is a summation of the furthest expansion of David Levien and Brian Koppelman's wildest ideas, all contrived to integrate in a very fun and witty way. If you're complaining halfway through about the excessive and perhaps wanton use of laborious gadgets of either complete fantasy or costing of more money and time than would be practically involved in whatever robbery, then you should've watched the first two soon before seeing this one to get yourself geared up again. People perhaps don't pay close enough attention to the small details of dialogue and story inferences in the Ocean films, because truly every ridiculous point has an explanation decent enough to be bought somewhere in there. There's one point where the gadget aspect of Danny Ocean's plan, which if mapped out would take a trigonometric genius, where I could've drawn the line. I won't explain the instance for fear of giving anything away, so all I will say is that if you're going to seduce someone, seduce them. There is no easy chemical or technological way out of the hard part of it, but there's a small bit of dialogue that's very comfortably and gracefully in character that permits this little excuse for the writers not to elaborate a clever seduction scene.<br/><br/>But if there's any real peeve, anyone should have, it's what I'm about to mention, yet nobody ever says a word about it: First, they needed eleven people, but we bought it because Danny and Rusty thought long and hard about how many people they would need to pull off a virtually impossible heist on a Las Vegas casino vault, which had never before been successfully robbed. In Ocean's Twelve, we bought it because everybody owed Andy Garcia their own share of the debt, and the plot gives way to a sensible reason why there would be a need for a twelfth parcel at the last minute. Now, if you are a master thief that has proved himself to be such, why do you need thirteen people to rob a casino? You're a master! You don't need that many! I do understand the necessity of maintaining the regular appearances of the stars we expect, but then why not involve Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones in this one at all?<br/><br/>The cast of course is a joy to see, and they all reprise their roles with the careful amount of familiarity. The heel-clickingly pleasing casting choice of Al Pacino is of course a satisfaction to the commercial portions of our movie-going mentalities, and of course we all know who he plays. I personally found Ellen Barkin to be underused and in need of further screen time. She's still very hot and still a very engrossing actress. To see the same on-screen pairing of her with Pacino as we did 18 years ago in Sea of Love is quite an interesting and unexpected element of the film, especially when in Sea of Love they played passionate people, tugging violently at each other's emotions. Here, they stand next to each other, rarely exchange words, and almost never look each other in the eye.<br/><br/>Soderbergh, who has brought a very fresh and inventive touch of heavy style to the series, creates yet another advanced version of the world of colors, shades, editing, and gloss of Ocean's Eleven. Here, we're accosted by pinks and purples, and otherwise every color in the film is filled in like a lush painting or a Technicolor film by Powell and Pressburger, and title cards are given special backgrounds breaking from the action of the film, behind 1970s-style, almost African-style font. Having always been one of my favorite directors, he stays fresh and clever. Perhaps one minute, you'll think, this movie doesn't have the emotion or scope of a finale, but then you realize that all the characters and environments are those of a cold, earthy gloss. No tempestuous chemistry exists between anyone or anything, and that is part of the universe these films create. Ocean's Thirteen does everything a good, fun heist movie does."

I heard mixed reviews but went to see it last week with an open mind.<br/><br/>The movie is thankfully based in Las Vegas again and is actually really good.

"MaxBorg89","8","1","4","18 June 2007"," Better than 12, that's for sure!
","In all fairness, Ocean's Twelve wasn't that bad: it was slick, well acted and fun, although it was evident that the script had been put together as an excuse for Clooney et al to have fun in Europe for a couple of months, the result being a bit of a mess. Thankfully, Ocean's Thirteen is better: there's only one job, we're back in Vegas and there are no ridiculous contrivances (well, maybe one or two, but the movie is too damn enjoyable for the audience to start questioning the logic).<br/><br/>Most importantly, though, the premise is much more interesting: whereas in Twelve the gang pulled off a series of heists in order to survive, this time round they are driven by revenge. The victim is Willy Bank (Al Pacino), a sleazy hotel owner who has put Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), one of the original eleven, out of business, causing him a heart attack. Because of this, Danny (George Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt), Linus (Matt Damon) and the others (minus Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who are left out since ""it's not their fight"") decide to get back at Bank by ruining the opening of his newest hotel/casino, only given the target (there's a virtually invincible security system, called Greco) they are going to need some extra help in the shape of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), whose loyalty is questionable to say the least. But with the clock ticking and a dozen of things that could go wrong, he is probably the last person to worry about.<br/><br/>Being back in Vegas really ensures director Steven Soderbergh and his cast are able to feel at home: the camera movements, the editing and the performances are more confident and less smug (in a good way, of course) than they were in the previous film, which however does not mean there isn't time for an in-joke or two (Damon's fake nose being the standout). The plotting is as ingenious as in Ocean's Eleven, although the writers make a huge mistake explaining every single step of the procedure in the first thirty minutes: after a while, it just becomes too much for any viewer to pay attention to. It is all compensated by the following hour and a half: the wit is as sharp as ever, the set-pieces are brilliant and visually delightful, and all thirteen cast members get their moment in the spotlight (among the ""minor"" players, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan are the most memorable), Damon in particular completing the transformation he went through in the first two movies, turning Linus from a nervous learner to a con-man worthy of the name. And what about Pacino? Most of the pre-release hype focused on him, and it has to be said that it was fully justified: the former Michael Corleone is one hell of a villain. Sure, he does get excellent support from Ellen Barkin, but if it weren't for the combined effort of Clooney, Pitt and Damon he would walk away with the entire movie, fearless, proud and merciless (the scene where he squares off with the leading man has to be his best moment in years).<br/><br/>So, to sum it all up: Eleven - near flawless; Twelve - amusing but a bit uneven; Thirteen - not exactly on par with the first one, but worth your money nonetheless."

","In a scene from ""Ocean's Thirteen"" Brad Pitt's Rusty Ryan asks George Clooney's teary eyed Danny Ocean, ""Are you watching Oprah?"" A few moments later Pitt's eyes well as both watch ""Oprah"" and he says, ""So they are really going to build her a house"" Clooney and Pitt are hysterical and making fun of their classic leading men personas. They are clearly having fun doing so. Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not just fluff; it is glorious fluff. This comical revenge tale by Brian Koppelman and David Levien is smart, funny and basically an excuse for a bunch of very talented actors to hang out and have fun. You have Academy Award Winners or Nominees Clooney, Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Al Pacino all together in one movie, who all enjoy working with each other. Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not ground breaking movie making; however, it is breezy cool at its best.<br/><br/>In ""Ocean's Thirteen"" Willie Banks (Al Pacino) betrays Reuben (Elliot Gould) in a hotel casino deal that nearly costs Reuben his life. Consequently, Danny, Rusty, Linus (Matt Damon) and the rest of the crew come to Rueben's rescue. Danny and Rusty also enlist the expertise of security strategist Roman (Eddie Izzard) to break the casino of the Banks Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. The Banks Hotel caters to the ""whales""extreme high rollers. However, Roman informs Danny and Rusty that the Banks Casino employs the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence system called ""Greco""named after its inventor Greco Montgomery (Julian Sand). The system is virtually fool proof. When part of their plan falters Danny is forced into an alliance with former rival Terry Benedict (ruthless Andy Garcia). At the same time there is a hilarious subplot involving a worker revolt in a dice manufacturing plant in Mexicoyou really have to see the movie to appreciate this.<br/><br/>There is nothing really distinctive about ""Ocean's Thirteen"" storyit is well paced and executed. The dialog is crisp, clever, and funny. Al Pacino does what he was hired to do which is gnaw on the scenery. He is masterful. Matt Damon makes a hilarious comic turn as Linus disguises himself as Lenny Pepperidge, the interpreter of a Chinese high roller. Don Cheadle is solid as Basher, doubling as expert engineer and motorcycle daredevil. George Clooney is smart, charming, and cool as Danny Ocean. Brad Pitt is at his breezy best, and again demonstrates his gift as a natural straight manalbeit to Clooney's Ocean. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is basically a guys' movieliterally. One saving grace is the stunning and strong Ellen Barkin as Banks' right hand Abigail Sponder.<br/><br/>Steven Sonderbergh hinted that this maybe the last ""Ocean's"". With ""Ocean's Thirteen"" being this much fun to watch, and apparently to make; he should keep on going. All involved are great and having a great time."
"umer_ejaz007","8","1","4","16 June 2007"," Better Improvement
","I think overall this film was a major improvement than the sequel. Steven Soderbergh seemed to hit all the right notes and managed to get the chemistry between all the actors flowing.<br/><br/>The film does however leave you to wonder why they didn't do this for the second one, this film has everything from glamour to glitz and showboating about everything. George Clooney and Brad Pitt's chemistry as Rusty and Danny is immense. These two actors for me could pull of any slick comedy.<br/><br/>I think the only down side to this film is that it was paying homage to the 50's and 60's by using some classic tunes, so i felt that it wasn't trying to be anything new but try and copy the original Ocean's 11.<br/><br/>But I think overall it is a superb film which gets better throughout the film, but this is where I think the buck stops, I can't see any more Ocean's, but however I would like to see more of Brad Pitt and George Clooney doing some slick comedy films because that's where I think they could pull of something big.<br/><br/>I think anyone that see's it will either hate it or love it, but for me it was a major improvement from the sequel. Oh yeah! Al Pacino, I thought wasn't given a big baddie role that I had hoped, but he was really interesting to watch and admire his presence. Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner were also brilliant.<br/><br/>Worth Watching."

","Oceans 13 is an end to the Oceans trilogy and it finishes off pretty good. A lot of people were weary about watching this because of the previous Ocean movie and i realise a lot of people didn't like the third one. I personally think that this movie rocks and although its not as good as the first one (what is?) it still kicks but.<br/><br/>The story is about revenge and also a heist on Willie Banks (Al Pacino) who cheated Rubin into giving up his business. Rubin has an attack and almost dies. Danny Ocean and his crew want to get back at Banks and so they take advantage of his Hotel/Casino.<br/><br/>The acting was definitely a 10/10 for everybody and it was a very good idea to get Pacino on board. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the others are very good and so is Garcia who is actually helping the Ocean crew in this one. It was also good to see Ellen Barkin and Pacino on screen together again for the first time in 19 years. (Sea of Love 1988) I think this movie is way better then Oceans 12 and is easy to watch and understand. I give it 7/8."
"FeLiPe-7","8","1","4","14 June 2007"," We love the formula! And it still works, LOL.
","Just got back from the film myself, and I gotta say I really enjoyed the show. The whole Ocean's trilogy plot reminds me of the Law & Order saga empire in that at this point, we get the gist of where the film is exactly going to go. It can be summed up in a basic plot formula: High profile thieves come up against a social/moral/financial obstacle, said thieves concoct brilliantly sound plan to resolve said obstacle, major crises may or may not happen in the process of solving said obstacle, antagonists get their comeuppance, and said thieves come away millions of dollars richer. Sprinkle some funny improv and great character acting and you have Ocean's 13. Still, I found myself laughing out loud - hard - to many of the movie's biting and often unexpected jokes. Plus, the ending is a happy one, so you can't go wrong there! But hey,don't take my word for it; this is definitely one you should hit the movies to see. Plus the music is AWESOME."
"meeza","8","1","4","14 June 2007"," Thirteen is lucky here!
","To develop another sequel to the Ocean franchise was not much of a gamble. ""11"" hit it big at the box office so the films producers decided to double-down on 11 and produce a continuing ""12"" which brought more than a dozen of glories to the Ocean franchise even though ""12"" was not admired by critics. So now the waves are high on the expectations of ""Ocean's Thirteen""! Will ""Ocean's Thirteen"" crash at the box office or will it be smooth financial sailing again? The film almost made $40 mil at the box office during its opening weekend run so I would say that this Specific Ocean is banking it in again. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" returns to Las Vegas and like ""11"" it focuses on an elaborate casino burglary scheme against a supercilious Las Vegas hotel entrepreneur. This time is Willy Banks played by Al Pacino. All the Ocean players are back to steal your heart with their witty banter and distinctive specializations. In case you forgot, the Ocean crew includes: The leader of this safecrack pack himself Danny Ocean (George Clooney), the slick Rusty (Brad Pitt), the ""wanting to prove"" Linus (Matt Damon), the Vegas hotel historian Reuben (Elliot Gould), the nervy Livingston (Eddie Jemison), the explosive Basher (Don Cheadle), the acrobatic shortie Yen (Shaobo Qin), the bickering brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) & Turk (Scott Caan), the Croupier smoothie Frank (Bernie Mac), and the conning elder Saul (Carl Reiner). OK, so that is just 11! Who are the other two? The hotel villain of ""11"" Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) yes you heard right; and a techy wizard Roman (Eddie Izzard). Banks right-hand-woman Abigail played by Ellen Barkin is the sole female primary character in this Ocean tale. The ensemble acting is not much of an audacious effort by these thespian clowns, but it is still a supreme spectacle of movie stars having a ball on-the-job and doing it formidably & coolly. I do have a slight favoritism towards Elliot Gould taking the acting gold of this crew for his comical work as Reuben. Pacino banked it in also for yet another grand performance as a baddie in playing Banks. I cannot tell you more specifics of ""Ocean's Thirteen"" because that would be Movie Spoilery! And even the Ocean's Crew do not commit that one! What I can tell you is that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is on a revenge heist against Banks who cheated Ruben out of millions on a hotel deal. Director Steven Soderbergh does recapture some of that cool aura and clever dialogue that brought ""Ocean's Eleven"" a critic goldmine. However, my money is still on ""Ocean's Eleven"" as the king of the trilogy! Nevertheless, you should still check out that Oceanview of ""Ocean's Thirteen"". **** Good"
"redeyedtreefrog","9","1","4","14 June 2007"," They're Back!
","This is an action comedy. I loved 11 but was disappointed with 12. Ocean's Twelve traded character and plot development for insanely confusing pseudo-action. The point is that they didn't have to make the trade. 11 & 13 have plenty of action and twist and turns to keep you hooked. All great heist movies have that element of mystery: who is it going to be? How is it going to end? However, they always let you be a part of the journey. You are allowed to know neither too much nor too little. This perfect balance of plot development keeps you thirsting for more and satisfying all the way. For all you ladies out there... what can I say? But this superb collection of talent appeals across the board. I was always going to watch 13 but I knew I HAD to see it when I heard that our beloved crew were going to team up with Benedict. The Night Fox twist was clever, as was the Oprah element. If only the imbalance of money flow could be so easily rectified. It was a very enjoyable escape for my sister and I. I will buy it when it comes out on DVD so I can enjoy the experience again and again. I hope The Italian Job will be as appealing!"
"Quinoa1984","7","1","4","13 June 2007"," simply a fun escapist heist movie
","Ocean's Thirteen unfolds not in an excellent great-movie way but how subversive heist movies should- being entertaining while also showing some chutzpah on the part of the filmmaker. Although not reaching the level of tense joy of the original, it does go past the tedious self-consciousness of the second film to be, well, still self-conscious, but in that way that puts Soderbergh to task as someone who can make lots and lots of exposition into the equivalent of a great drink in a pricey bar. From the title cards to the angles that reveal even the smallest angles the characters are playing at (or maybe are not playing at, or are again), to the big $ numbers over the heads of everyone in the casino in the climax, and to how he gets such Hollywood Lotharios into bad wigs and mustaches and noses, it's a minor master's class in being hip and accessible for the mall crowd while still being splendid for simple genre admirers.<br/><br/>This time, as well, it's not so much a tale of a heist for the sake of simply putting many millions into the pockets of the thieves, but as a matter of pride (a shake of Sinatra's hand is a point of merit for the older characters in this world, and it is sort of a world, of Las Vegas). Reuben (Gould) gets a heart attack after finding out he's been screwed over by Bank (Pacino), who is some-pun-intended an insanely wealthy man who's opening a new casino Reuben was supposed to be partner on. The Ocean gang decide to strike back at him the worst- letting the house lose, big time, for all the high rollers in attendance on opening night. This time, even more than the first and second films, the heist is elaborate, maybe too elaborate; there's a whole sub-plot devoted to Mexican factory workers who get riled up by Virgil and Turk to rise up against their bosses, despite the fact that they need to keep working to send the fake dice to the casino. Every side is covered, or almost every one, and there are no spots open in this one for romantic entanglements or much else. The element of Reuben bed-stricken is at the heart of the film, and everything else is, simply put, guilty pleasure hijinks of the subtlest kind.<br/><br/>And, naturally, each character has their moments to shine. The aforementioned nose bit from Linus is one of the funniest gags in the whole trilogy, as obvious as it is. Don Cheadle gets to break out of his singularly English bit as Basher to go into daredevil garb to act as a pure distraction to Pacino. On the flip-side, Reiner becomes a prissy English high-roller. Some outsider running gags come in with David Paymer as a board member put into a purposeful bad luck blender. Even Pitt and Clooney get in on the fun, with Rusty donning a ridiculous get-up as a concerned seismologist. Overall, Ocean's Thirteen doesn't make for a very substantial dramatic feat, or even a very great comedy (Bernie Mac isn't as up to snuff as in the first film, and the moments with Oprah are more touching, ironically, than anything laugh-out-loud), but it is in its own superficial and too-cool-for-school way a must-see. 7.5/10"

","Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon and the rest of the Ocean's cast directed by Steven Soderbergh comes back for thirds in what seems to be another enjoyably shot slick flick.<br/><br/>Danny Ocean (played by the elegantly aging Clooney) rallies the boys to bring down casino owner Willy Bank (played by Al Pacino), who double-crossed one of Ocean's eleven, the elderly and too-trusting Reuben.<br/><br/>In Ocean's Thirteen, notably absent are screen divas Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones (how can they realistically top that power tandem?!), but Ellen Barkin resurrects herself as the mature (by Hollywood standards) but sexy Abigail Sponder, Bank's second in command and the film's lone female lead. While she was obviously not meant to replace Roberts and Zeta-Jones, I'm glad they chose her; no young starlet could possibly compare.<br/><br/>The movie still delivers lots of shallow fun and allows the audience some 'inside joke' humor, more effectively translating this feeling than the previous Ocean's 12. Clooney gets to plug his social responsibility angle; Pitt gets to continue to eat in each scene; Damon enjoys more screen time as the eager to please Linus; while the rest of the gang pretty much lends likable support roles. Then again, Ocean's team is a bunch of affable thieves who always get what they want; their charming, sociopathic appeal makes their audience want to see them succeed."

Ocean's Eleven is my favourite film, I've seen it 46 times and I'm sure I could see this one just as many also. Don't be discouraged by Ocean's Twelve (which was fine except for the Julia Roberts plot) Ocean's Thirteen is a fresh classy sequel. Plus, the poster was good, if you like that sort of stuff. I am kinda repeating Cole Boerens (sorry I have only just read your review after writing my eighth line). However, the ideas put across by Cole and myself are true. Eddie Jemison, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Matt Damon were the stand-out performances in this film. I had hoped Don Cheadle would have been better"

","It kept me going because of its witty plot, otherwise, I would be sleeping in the cinema's cushy seat. I like them figuring how to revenge this Wilie Bank. They use ideas and I like that. The story is very simple. Ruben (Elliott Gould) almost fainted when Wilie (Al Pacino) asks him to sign his share. The story is that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang must come back to revenge Wilie. To bankrupt his great hotel.<br/><br/>They start planning from there, and from there it seems a bit slow in the plot. Why don't they start doing things? The idea made me glued to the seat and not move although in some part, I had to blink my eyes or look to nowhere. I have to admit that some parts made me restless because this is the first time I am watching a movie that talks and talks. But still, I manage to see the whole movie. The plot is great and the acting is great. I feel that the music is a bit cheery so I think it would be better if they mix Ocean's 12's music into this movie.<br/><br/>Bravo to the director who had the ideas of making it interesting and the ideas of continuing the whole series of the Ocean's. Those who is dieing of some big action, this is not for you as it will bore you. It may not be worth for the ticket but it is still worth to watch."

The heist is top-notch, with a few close calls.<br/><br/>Who stands out in this movie the most with the best performance? It's a tough one. I personally like the Malloy brothers (played by Caan and Affleck). They were just hilarious. Everyone else did a great job in their role as well.<br/><br/>The first Ocean's movie is still probably the best, as a movie itself, as pretty much everything was well executed, but then again, I didn't like Julia Roberts' performance, so to me, this one comes very close. I've never seen Ocean's Twelve, and while I hear that it's the worst of the three, I will still watch it sometime whenever. Anyway, this movie is recommended for everyone. You won't be disappointed."
"jra21","8","1","4","10 June 2007"," Very Entertaining, Though Not as Expected
","Ocean's 13 is an interesting third outing as it moves in a somewhat different direction from the slick, complicated misdirection of the first film and the mottled, forgettable attempts at humor of the second. Instead, the film is supported by character interaction, which succeeds on many different levels. This is no surprise of course considering the talent involved. All the actors contribute to the film well with the possible exceptions of George Clooney, who hams it up a bit more than usual, and some of the more minor character roles (mostly those outside Ocean's actual 13), which are a bit drowned in the enormity of the rest of the cast (an inevitability). The film is an enjoyable surprise because instead of stylized plot and grandiose emotion, it instead highlights subtle (and sometimes not so subtle in the case of Clooney's exaggeration) character interactions that keep the watcher chuckling and sometimes outright laughing throughout the entire movie. The standout performances are by far Matt Damon and Brad Pitt, who carry the film in most of the more humorous scenes. Pitt seems to be the smooth, cool anchor of the film always making the most of his screen time and persona, while still facilitating the other actors' performance. The only disappointment of the film (and it is only a minor disappointment) is Al Pacino. This may be an unpopular remark, but he does not stand out in his role instead he delivers a consistent, but unremarkable performance. Oceans 13 is an excellent and amusing piece of entertainment though it may not contain enough sex and violence to appeal to the crazed summer movie public."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Every bit as good as the first one, and far superior to 12 ... the only thing missing is the excitement of a new franchise. Director Steven Soderbergh and all the familiar smirking faces are back, as is the colorful wardrobe.<br/><br/>With a look and feel very similar to the ultra-cool first one with Sinatra and Martin, Thirteen is back at home in Vegas where the franchise belongs. This time the revenge is aimed at mega-sleaze ball Al Pacino, who screws over Ellott Gould for his share of the hottest new casino in Vegas. The boys aren't happy about this and, of course, what comes next is an elaborate plan that only someone as genius as George Clooney and Brad Pitt could truly comprehend. Anyway, it is fun to watch Pacino do what he loves ... chew his scenes with vigor.<br/><br/>The other new face is that of Ellen Barkin, in her return to the big screen after her billionaire divorce. I for one, enjoyed having her sit and home counting money and cringed to hear she would be back on screen. Luckily she is given little to do other than wear a tight dress and act drugged around Matt Damon.<br/><br/>The smarm is on full display as Pitt and Clooney continue to finish each other's sentences and the best scenes utilize Soderbegh's quick edits to capture the fine timing of all boys and their assignments. Even Andy Garcia is back and joins in the revenge plot with a twist of his own. As is customary, each of the boys gets their own little moment of spotlight, some to more success than others. It is nice to see Vincent Cassell (the only good thing about 12) back, if only for a brief visit.<br/><br/>Overall, this hits what it swings at, and is nothing more or nothing less than we would expect from these pros who show up every three years to have some fun and get paid. Undoubtedly, there will be another in the series, as they have the process down to a science and they receive a nice pay day. Small price to pay for a fun popcorn flick."

","I enjoyed this movie. I didn't think it was as good as the remake of the original ""Ocean's 11"", with the late Frank Sinatra, but it was better than ""Ocean's 12"" in my book. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, all reprise their roles in this one. One character is conspicuously absent, and I still haven't heard the reason why that person isn't in this one. I won't say who it is, but you probably know who I'm talking about... Anyway, it is good ""fast food"" entertainment, which is pretty much what I expected when I entered the theater to view this one. Don Cheadle is great as ""Basher"", with his Cockney accent. People say this is boring and predictable, but I went in with the idea that this was sensational stuff, which it is. It's purely there for entertainment, it doesn't put on airs that it's going to make you ""scratch your head"", or anything like that."

","The hits keep on coming. The story of the group of handsome and charming males, who want to relieve a casino of its treasures, is irresistible to the big stars in this film. The setup allows them plenty of room to show off their various talents. So, a relaxed and compatible group of all-star actors are gathered together again, like moths drawn to a light, as in the two preceding Danny Ocean films.<br/><br/>The setting of Las Vegas is also irresistible, with beautiful date palm trees lining the streets, its constant solicitude of the comfort and entertainment of its many guests, its beautiful neon lights and fountains and unique architecture, and its fascinating casinos, of course. Living close to Tunica, Mississippi, with plenty of casinos of its own, I was amused to hear the lines uttered by Al Pacino, ""Tunica. Isn't that where games go to die?"" And, surely Tunica will never approach the brilliance of Las Vegas, which is shown off to its best advantage in this film.<br/><br/>Al Pacino adds much to this final film of the trilogy. Pacino knows how to assume the style of a successful and rich hotel-casino owner, without betraying boredom, impatience, or hostility. A hotel-casino owner should be the perfect host, especially during the opening day of the hotel-casino. And, Pacino is the perfect, if somewhat paranoid, host as Pacino puts on the skin of his character in a convincing manner. Also, Andy Garcia is a pleasure as the competing hotel-casino owner and co-conspirator with Danny Ocean.<br/><br/>The film again features computer wizardry and cunning technical gadgetry along with the quick wits and physical dexterity necessary to bring such a difficult heist off, as in the previous two films of the trilogy. This film, like Las Vegas itself, has so many attractions that it is hard to not overlook some brilliant moments in this fascinating film. The film is like the diamond necklaces, featured in the film. Every changing facet of the diamonds gives the viewer a new pleasure and delightful view."

","I'm surprised by the number of scathing reviews I've read on this site. To me, this was back on par with the fun and cleverness of the first film. Overall, Thirteen was the funniest and breeziest of the three Ocean films. A lot of people have complained about the incredulity of the schemes and scenarios, and though this is true, it never took me away from the movie. It's supposed to be a fun, escapist movie. A summer romp.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of this movie is the absence of an unnecessary romantic sub-story. I'm of the opinion that much of what is wrong with film and TV these days is the constant recycling of the same old love sub-stories. These stories have no place, generally, in fun heist movies. They have become expected, predictable, and annoying. I could list the films and TV shows that have been ruined by this trend. Anyway, the point is, Ocean's Thirteen is as good as it is largely because there is no Julia Roberts love triangle to distract us from the real story, what we really came to see. A heist! I think Ocean's Eleven was really a better film for the most part, but the whole love story nearly ruined it for me. That's why Thirteen is my favorite of the Ocean movies. And the film seems to know it itself, as there is never any mention of Julia Roberts' or Catherine Zeta-Jones' characters.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that Thirteen is the funniest of the three Ocean movies. Much of the humor is slightly self-referential, but never overly-so. Many of the lines are of the same witty variety that were so funny in the first film as well.<br/><br/>The acting is just as good as it was in Ocean's Eleven. Pitt and Clooney have so much chemistry together (on a strictly heterosexual level, not that there's anything wrong with that). They're just so darn good at being suave, cool, witty thieves that we love to root for. Pacino is terrific as the bad guy, of course, and Andy Garcia and Ellen Barkin are very good as well, though there is not as much for them to work with. I was a little disappointed that Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac didn't get as much screen time as they should have, but they did well with what they had, Cheadle especially.<br/><br/>What's so great about Ocean's Thirteen is that it consistently stays true to what it is: a fun heist movie. It moves along at a fast pace and never wavers. Like the original with the Rat Pack, this movie is really all about the guys, the Eleven, and I love that there is no cheesy love story to take away from that. Ocean's Thirteen is light and breezy for a heist film, and the humor adds to that. Overall, it is the perfect summer escape movie, and it makes no attempts to be any more than just that. It's my favorite of the three."

","""Ocean's Eleven"" felt like an intelligent and entertaining movie. It did very well with the story and its diverse cast, and it benefited greatly from the start leads.... Then came ""Ocean's Twelve"", and maybe t was the extra cast member; it just felt bloated and dragged.<br/><br/>Now the gang is back, and few people might disagree with any of the following descriptions because this sequel is truly spectacular, engrossing, sensational, wild, intelligent, remarkable, quick-paced, clever, striking, original, sexy, funny, surprising, appealing, vibrant, colorful, and the list could go on and on.<br/><br/>Films like these work well when the adversary is something to fear, and Pacino's millionaire does bring with him class, and a few scary maneuver. He hasn't reached his level of success for being Mr. Nice Guy. This time the offense is personal, and Ocean recruits his gang to set things right, and if this requires that the plot of the film becomes a bit complex in its execution, it's o.k. After all, we need equal amounts of intelligence, charm, elegance, and a touch of double-crossing. As the second in command, Ellen Barkin exudes intelligent sensuality and carries her duty with aplomb of stars from days lone gone. Here is a sexy and mature actress who knows how give a look, make a move, and wear a spectacular dress, all while conducting daily business.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is equally outstanding, Clooney, Pitt, and Damon once again demonstrate why they have become popular leading men. Each could carry the film on his own, but we're grateful they know how to share screen time. Unfortunately there is not enough time to mention everyone's contributions. Let's just say, the parts make the whole work very well.<br/><br/>Much of the success of the film is also a result of fantastic CGI, art direction, and set decorations to bring to life a fictional world in one of the biggest and most competitive playgrounds in the world. The new hotel is both garish and impressive, with loving care given to the design of gambling environment and other hotel sections. There is also sufficient time spent on explaining how the hotel business works, without overwhelming us with too many details, just enough information to give us a taste of the cutthroat world that Las Vegas can be.<br/><br/>Sodenbergh successfully shows how good a director he can be, once again presenting us with a treat rarely seen in Hollywood, an intelligent, entertaining, and well developed story that supports a very good looking cast and film."

","The only reason I felt compelled to keep watching this movie is that fact that its quite well known and the actors in it are all pretty good (minus George Clooney). But did they really need to drain every last drip of enjoyment out of the films by producing another Ocean's? Just another classic example of US producers making crap movies to draw people into get as much sales as they can. This film had no originality and seemed exactly the same as Ocean's 11, what was the point of making a copy? Things always seemed to go perfectly for Danny Ocean and the whole criminal world was centred in on American white boys. I'm glad more recent movies have branched out into including other parts of the world in a genuine way, unlike the racial undertones in reference to Shaobo Qin's character. It reminded me of movies like Transformers where the robots landed by chance in USA, bearing in mind 70% of the earth is water. I feel like this movie would've been better if wasn't just trying to take the piss the whole time and replaced the smug criminals with people that actually seemed like they could pull it off. I don't really get why this movie series has become famous, other than the fact that it has Clooney, Pitt, and Damon altogether on one screen."

","After the slog that was Ocean's 12, I'm glad to see this one learned from the mistakes of its predecessor and got back to the roots of what made Ocean's 11 so fun. Don Cheadle finally gave up on his terrible Cockney accent, and 3 out of every 4 of his lines are said in an American accent. A lot of the heist moments were really smart, and it was a just an all around good ""Robin Hood"" type story. The villain was a real scumbag, and that made it easy to root for the main characters even though they aren't the best people either. This film was missing a lot of the heart that ""Eleven"" had and that was disappointing. I feel there should have been more drama between the characters and story. This was an improvement over ""Twelve"" but not as good as ""Eleven"".

","There was a time, when American was black and white, when any toothless dropout with a gun could hold up a bank or a payroll by rolling the fat, sleepy security guard, then get into a fatal shootout with cops. And then get memorialized in a mediocre B-movie.
Then along comes Bonnie & Clyde and those two losers get the full glam treatment. Fair enough, that was a great movie. But Hollywood should have quit while it was on top.
Fast-forward 50+/- years and we've got a tired genre. Maybe you can still walk into a bank in Bumblefk, Iowa, and steal some cash from the tellers. But who wants to watch a movie about that? No, heist movies have to be big-time, big-screen action movies. So they're either stealing state secrets or holding up casinos or what-have-you. Except nobody, in real life, is brute-forcing their way into modern bank vaults or Vegas casinos. Too many cameras. Too much security. Too many armed guards.
The modern heist movie is Wall Street rigging energy distribution in California, with a company named Enron as a fig leaf, and nobody getting shot, one guy going to jail, and then getting suicided shortly thereafter. That's the modern reality of heists.
Movies like Ocean 13 are just cartoon junk. Well-dressed sugary treats that are mere color revivals of black&white B-movie plots that weren't that compelling in the first place.
Stop making action/heist movies, already. They are dead."

Not only does it right the ship after the self-satisfied & lazy Twelve, it quite nearly matches the greatness of the original. Stripping it all back down to one heist (maybe the best of the series), it returns to the clever scripting, dry humor & emotional base of Eleven, with Pitt & Clooney cementing their legacy as one of the great cinema duos. Their crying while watching Oprah is everything."
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","1","21 November 2014"," Not as good as Eleven, but still great crime with splashes of comedy.
","This third installment showcasing Vegas' most brilliant group of crooks may not have the same effect and quality of Eleven, but is nonetheless a good movie. It is certainly a step up from Ocean's Twelve, which I wasn't that impressed with and has more of the spirit of the first film. The only characters missing are Tess and Isabel, which some fans might not find to their liking. I feel like it might have been possible to give them both some kind of short scene. Returing faces are of course the original eleven (being Danny, Rusty, Linus, Frank, Basher, Virgil and Turk Malloy, Rueben, Saul, Livingston, and the Amazing Yen.) Also returning is our old enemy Terry Benedict, along with Rusty's hotel manager Roman, and SPOILER ALERT the Night Fox. Our new foe is the backstabbing, double-crossing Willy Bank, played by Al Pacino. He doesn't even bother trying to claim that he isn't a complete jerk. He knows that he is and it boosts his ego. He gives no excuse for backstabbing Reuben and you can tell that doing things like this is his life. We get a couple of new faces on the team in Eugene the gamer kid and a cop called Neil that sells Willy Bank's gold utensils on a black market. Both get very small parts and have next to no role in the robbery. The only other new parts worth noting are the five diamond award judge, or Very Unimportant Person, that is given a horrible experience at Bank's new hotel, and Bank's right hand (wo)man Abigail Sponder. In regards to comedy, there is a fair amount of the situational humor (especially in the hotel recon) that we get from the other two. Accompanying these are the witty remarks from the ultra-chilled protagonists. Of course the central theme of the movie is the robbery, which is performed, not for money, but for revenge on the part of Reuben. The veteran of the team suffers a heart attack after getting dissed by Bank. This becomes the motive for the robbery and we see Reuben regaining strength and will to live as he sees the team working for him. The plan in this scenario is not to get all of Bank's money, but to make him lose as much as possible on the opening night of his new hotel-casino. The plan has many parts to it with each character taking a different faction of the big plan. Danny Ocean is useless as always and does little more than negotiate with Bank. Frankly, I think that the whole series could be done without his character and not be any worse for it, but I won't bore you with all of my reasons for thinking that because I hate it when people go on rants in movie reviews. Rusty does some recon and works out the master plan with Roman and Danny. Roman is brought in as a troubleshooter and gives the team intelligence on the Greco security system. Livingston's job this time is not to hack any kind of system. He instead gets himself a job as a blackjack dealer in the casino and tries to rig the system. Frank hires a group of waitresses to work for the team in the hotel. Virgil Malloy is sent to Mexico to work in a dice factory where he loads the dice with magnetic powder. He also steps up in a crucial spot to hack a computer system in place of Livingston after Livingston gets busted for his blackjack antics. Turk basically does all of the mundane jobs for the team like in the first film, only without Virgil with him. Saul poses as a rich guest in the hotel and is visibly well attended to, while the VUP watches and is treated very poorly by the hotel staff. The Amazing Yen has a rather forced role as a high roller whale staying at the hotel for the soft opening. His ""agent"" and translator is a disguised Linus. His job is to distract Abigail Sponder while the rest of the plan in carried out. That only leaves Basher, whose job it is to knock down the incredible security system, The Greco. The one way to get it shut down is to create a natural disaster. Basher runs the turbine that creates an earthquake effect. During the three minutes that system is shut down, the bag of tricks cooked up by the rest of the team gets opened and the Bank is broken. At the same time, another robbery is taking place. Willy Bank's five diamond awards are the one thing that Terry Benedict is willing to get as payment for funding the team. This is a very difficult prize to pull, but as always the Ocean's gang gets it done and manages to embarrass Benedict in the process. Bank is stunned and crushed at the end as his dreams fall apart and his diamonds of the past and future are stolen from him. This scene is rather reminiscent of another '07 blockbuster, At Worlds End, when Cutler Becket has his ship torn to pieces along with his confidant facade. The execution is solid as in the first film with split screen cinematography and well written characters put into a well written script. The acting, of course, doesn't get much better with this kind of cast, and we get a more soothing guitars horns and light drums to accompany the crooks in their ever present mood of cool under pressure. To conclude, it's a good crime movie with a strong story, though not as good or as character balanced as Ocean's Eleven. If you liked Eleven, Thirteen should still be enjoyable, but not as spectacular. If you have doubts because of Twelve, throw them aside. There are splashes of comedy, but don't watch it unless you are willing to pay attention or have a friend to watch it that can keep you informed of the plot progression. Overall Rating: 8.3/10."

","I've just re-watched Ocean's 11, 12 (forwarding all the time) and 13 and the last is definitely the best with me. One doesn't look for much sense in a heist movie as long as it is funny and entertaining which O13 sure is. The plot is rather unbelievable, from drilling an underground tunnel in Vegas with the Chunnel machines to ripping a secure glass showcase out of heavy-duty concrete base. With a helicopter, yeah. So far it is all fantasy but a very cute one. The heist scheme is partly revealed althrough the preparation but the viewer doesn't get the whole picture and has to puzzle it out up to the very end. That's enough to keep you on throughout the movie, with some very funny moments here and there, and the whole cast's very good acting. The Mexican episodes were superb.<br/><br/>I also unexpectedly liked the absence of female characters save Barkin's Abbie cougar, or any sappy romance (as much as I enjoy Catherine Zeta-Jones and tolerate Roberts). Thank to that absence we have a cool, funny, resolute team in which everyone has more or less equal importance to the watcher, and their camaraderie is warm and easy. No one steals the show.<br/><br/>This movie is a keeper. 'Nuff said!"

As usual, the gang's plan to bring down Bank is preposterous, filled with technological gimmicks, rigging all of the betting machines and the dice, etc., as they deal with worker problems at one of the manufacturers in Mexico. It's fun to see it come together. However, it's also a little confusing and nowhere near as entertaining as Ocean's Eleven.

","While I have watched just about every heist movie ever made, I have to admit now that I am no longer a professional film reviewer that I was never crazy about the genre. There are exceptions of course, but in general, I get bored watching such films, as they all have similar plots. For those who got a kick out of OCEANS 11, I suspect this second sequel will tickle your fancy, if you can follow it. I watched it much too casually, and kept getting lost. For the record, Clooney and crew are on the vengeance trail against casino owner Pacino, who screwed over one of their own (Gould). I was quite happy to see veterans Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner still in on the action. Keep an eye on Damon in this one. For my money, he -- not Pacino -- steals the show."

(dismissed very quickly, in fact) The beauty of the first film is that it threw us for a few loops, unless you were VERY observant. 12's plot was out of left field. In this one, you're in on the con, but they take a few sideways turns on you to make it funny. More importantly, they do a fair job of involving everybody in the film.

First of all, the plot element of the team trying to make a hotel rater's stay at Mr. Bank's hotel miserable sort of made me feel negatively about this film. This was an almost disgusting section of the movie (poisoning his food and putting lice on his bed) that could have been done in a less disturbing way. Also, what's with the character of the Night Fox in this film? In the previous film, he was a smart and clever character, and here he is simply made to look like an idiot. The writers could have done much better here. Most of the regular cast is good in this film, as usual. Al Pacino, though he makes a fine addition to the series, is not himself here. He neither acts nor sounds like his old self. It's hard to believe this is the same person from ""The Godfather"" movies.

Brad PItt and Geroge Clooney make suave look easy, and Matt Damon has really grown into this role.

The heist in this film is the best yet, because you can truly root for the good guys. In a turn from the other Ocean's films, the crew is NOT robbing but rather liberating the money from WIllie Bank, played by Al Pacino.

I always feel like the mood is captured at an Ocean's film through the amazing soundtrack.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this movie: Al Pacino. The man is past his acting prime.

Soderbergh definitely saw that he didn't have much to do, so they threw him in for that task. As well as the character Yen, although for some reason they use him as a high roller. Would they do this? Take this risk for the things at stake? Pacino is a new addition and he's laid back here, surprisingly. He still chews up the scenery though. Ellen Barkin is also a new addition as Pacino's assistant. She plays a tough face, no stretch or anything. The funniest performance is from Casey Affleck, who helps with a strike in Mexico. Even Izzard and Garcia show up again.<br/><br/>Some of the things they do are a little stretched, as is the amount of money they have. But we go along for it anyway. We are here to watch the impossible happen. To watch these guys have fun doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The con is nothing special, they rig casino games. Nothing too extravagant, the whole film seems to be not trying as hard. With the sequel they are raising houses, nothing that big here, just rigging card games.<br/><br/>In the end, I can give this a recommendation because I did have fun. I never took any of it seriously and neither should you. If you want action and big cons, it won't be here. They go smaller this time. They also pull some twists, which is expected, so it doesn't come as a big shock when it happens. When any of them happen. There are lots of inside jokes as well, if you get them you'll enjoy it a little more. Either way, give it a try."

","Nothing could really live up to the magic of the first film in the franchise, but this one definitely comes close. It's a hell of a lot of fun with the same witty, hilarious style that I loved in the first two but this one raises the stakes just a bit. The heist is bigger...but they also aren't really stealing anything for themselves so it's a bit anticlimactic. This one is probably the most original of the series and also the most outrageous. I mean Casey Affleck freaking out and starting a worker's strike at a Mexican dice-making factory? And then Scott Caan being sent to stop him only to be seen throwing a Molotov cocktail at the police? It doesn't get much better than that, and I was laughing until the tears came. The cast is brilliant as always with everyone from George Clooney and Brad Pitt to Casey Affleck and Eddie Izzard delivering knockout performances. Al Pacino is the perfect addition as the villain this time around and he plays the part like he was made for it. It's clear that everyone had a lot of fun making Ocean's Thirteen and that sheds through to a wild, hilarious and immensely enjoyable ride for the viewer."

","Let's face it. Ocean's Eleven is the best film in the trilogy followed by this film. <br/><br/>Ocean's thirteen was bigger and better than Oceans Twelve simply because it is set in Las Vegas and there is only one motif. Revenge. <br/><br/>I think that the film is quite entertaining and funny at times but the main problem is that Willie Banks, Danny and Rusty have too much screen time while the others are merely minor characters. <br/><br/>The stages are amazing and the costumes are unbeatable but what makes this film great is the passion the producers and director had making this movie.

","As with ""Ocean's 11"", the best parts here are everything leading up to the heist (I haven't as yet seen ""Ocean's 12""). I guess that I've always thought that the coolest parts of elaborate plots are the plots themselves rather than the result. Just earlier this month, I went to Las Vegas to see Cirque du Soleil's ""Love"" (a visual production of the Beatles' songs; I highly recommend it), so it was fairly interesting to see the sites here. I interpreted Willie Banks's (Al Pacino) hotel as the real symbol of Las Vegas: disgustingly giant so as to fulfill one's own hubris.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is some pretty neat entertainment. Steven Soderbergh has certainly proved himself a capable director during these past few years. Playing their roles from the earlier movies are George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould. In fact, Carl Reiner's character reminded me of his earlier Alan Brady (the boss on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show""). The bald Alan always wears a wig, just like Reiner's character here wears a wig as part of his disguise.<br/><br/>The new cast members are Pacino, Ellen Barkin, Eddie Izzard and David Paymer."

","Basically this movie is a great, fun, quality way to spend 2 hours.<br/><br/>The whole script and 'criminal plan' in it is not as cleverly or solid constructed as in the first movie, so fans of the first, don't expect another ""Ocean's Eleven"". The movie doesn't really have a clear main plot, since you as a viewer also don't know exactly how the plan is going to work out. It isn't really the sort of a movie with a clear beginning, middle and end. It's more the sort of movie with a story that just 'happens', in which events just happens as they come along. It also adds to the unpredictability of the movie, which is of course on the other hand a good thing.<br/><br/>It's again a greatly directed movie, with some great and unique classy style of its own, that shall remind you the most of movie's from the old days. The movie is good looking and fast paced, which makes the 2 hours go by without really realizing it.<br/><br/>It was great to see Al Pacino in a role such as this. He hadn't played a real villain for far too long! In this movie he can basically let himself go, but without ever really doing so, in order to not totally outclass the rest of the cast, that are after all the real heart of the series and are what the movies are all about. All of the other 'eleven' actors also appear in this movie again. It's obvious they still have just as much fun playing together as they did when they first started in 2001. That is the foremost reason why it's not unthinkable that more sequels will follow in the future, which will most likely also be directed again by Steven Soderbergh, who also seems to get along with the cast just fine. It's the fun and the fun that the actors obviously had playing together in this movie. that makes ""Ocean's Thirteen"" also such a fun movie to watch. Especially George Clooney and Brad Pitt seem to have really found each other.<br/><br/>No, nothing too impressive or memorable but as long as your expectations for it aren't too high and you're not expecting another ""Ocean's Eleven"", you'll simply have a fine and fun time watching this and therefor this is a real recommendable movie.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"fwomp","6","0","1","30 November 2007"," Starting To Founder
","Being a pretty big fan of the OCEAN'S series, I was looking forward to something new and fresh from director Steven Soderbergh. He did a nice job on OCEAN'S ELEVEN and OCEAN'S TWELVE but here, with thirteen, this tired franchise gets soggy.<br/><br/>The back-and-forth banter is still there (thankfully!) as are some great comedic moments. Most notably is a scene between Rusty (Brad Pitt, BABEL) and Danny (George Clooney, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) when Rusty visits Danny in his hotel room and catches him tearing up at an Oprah show; this also comes up toward the end of the film when a large donation to charity is made. Also the banter between Rusty and Lenny (Matt Damon, THE GOOD SHEPHERD) is nicely played when Lenny has to don a massive costume nose as a disguise (""Oh the nose plays."") But this is where we leave entertainment and hit some rough seas. The story of one of the Ocean's crewman getting wronged and becoming deathly ill is the pivotal point upon which the entire story swirls, and yet we feel nothing for this person because so little time is spent on him and too much time spent on the EXTREMELY intricate plot devices surrounding their latest ""get even"" gig. The fixing of blackjack tables, slots, and roulette are given far too much film time, as is a Mexican uprising for fair wages in a factory where some dicey dice are being made for Ocean and his team. The point was supposed to be on getting some payback for the wrong done to one of their own and yet ...we don't see much of that.<br/><br/>It's noteworthy to point out, too, that the film, however faulty, is very well acted. George Clooney and new bad-guy Al Pacino play well against each other on-screen (""I know the guys you'd send after me and they like me better than you""). Even the heavily busted Ellen Barkin does a good job as an uptight hotel manager bent on profit (the only ridiculous scene with her was when she is somehow overpowered by a sexy scent worn by one of Ocean's manly men).<br/><br/>The final damaging blow to the film comes from its beginnings in which we're re-introduced to Roman Nagel (Eddie Izzard, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND) and he is supposedly utilized in the Ocean team's plan to get even. But after he gives them some information on how to break into certain high security areas, he's lost forever from the script. That was very jarring.<br/><br/>Even with these problems the movie is fun if the story is not. The strong acting make it watchable, but don't think too hard about its intricacies or your brain might explode."

I am not gonna go into any details but if you've seen the first one (Ocean's Eleven), you'll love this one for sure. This movie has almost the same humor as the first one but the evil master-plan is certainly the best one out of all three.

It wasn't about George Clooney or Brad Pitt, and all of the character's area of expertise came out with more umph. There are a lot of surprise parts with the returning of a lot characters, how they're going to pull the robbery off, and if one of the characters is going to survive something bad that happened to him.

","After the sorrow disappointment that was Ocean's Twelve, I was not at all interested in seeing Ocean's Thirteen since I had a feeling it was just going to be the same thing again. But when people were seeing this film, I was hearing good things about the film. So I figured I would just wait until the rental, I just watched this film yesterday and still, I'm not a huge fan of the Ocean movies, but Thirteen is a good movie. The cast really looked like they had a great time making the film and Al Pacino was a great addition, he makes such a great bad guy. For once, I have to say that Matt Damon actually did a great job in film, I know people are going to bash me for that, but he never keeps my attention in films, but he had a great role to play in Thirteen and was a great comic relief. The story is continued with our hunky heist men.<br/><br/>The gang is now suffering paying back the millions that they stole from Terry, so they're not exactly in the mood to get back together any time soon. But when one of their own is betrayed and double crossed by the new man in Vegas, Will Banks, they are out for revenge. Since Will is making a huge splash, he has a casino, a hotel, and millions of dollars worth of diamonds, the boys have to got to find a way to get to his heart. They band together to get this guy back and get their old schemes back in play.<br/><br/>Ocean's Thirteen was a lot of fun to watch, it had a bunch of twists and turns at each point. I think my favorite part though was when Matt Damon was posing as Pepperidge and he was seducing Bank's assistant, even though it was a silly moment, it brought a lot of comic relief and the girl was just so funny. Not to mention how they got the diamonds out of the casino was so cool and was great eye candy. The cast did a great job and Thirteen is definitely worth the look. It was a whole lot better than Twelve, let's hope they keep it that way.<br/><br/>7/10"

The gang wants revenge, and so sets out to make every gambler a winner on the new casino's opening night by rigging all the machines.

"javaman-7","7","0","2","17 September 2007"," The Latter Day Rat Pack is Back
","Java Man Reviews ""Ocean's Thirteen"" (2007, PG-13) Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Written by Brian Koppelman and David Levine. Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Ellen Barkin, Al Pacino, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould & David Paymer. Running Time: 122 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his latter day rat pack are back in Vegas for another high-stakes caper, this time with a new mark, Willy Bank (Pacino). Bank has swindled Reuben Tishkoff (Gould) out of his partnership share in a new casino and the resulting shock has put Reuben into the ICU. Danny and Rusty (Pitt) gather the gang together to avenge their old pal, and even hope a successful score may bring Reuben back from death's door. The idea is to sabotage the casino's opening night, filch Bank's fortune, ruin his reputation and get to the hospital in time to give Reuben the good news. Of course Bank's empire and all of its sophisticated systems are impregnable, but that's just one more challenge for Danny and his team (and for the screenwriters). Dice are magnetized in Mexico, shufflers and slot machines are rigged, a camera is hidden in Bank's office--but these are just routine tasks for the Thirteen. To make it all work, they must get Bank's computers to shut down for three minutes--and that would take an earthquake.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 JAVA MUGS OUT OF 4 <br/><br/>When Reuben learns of Bank's treachery,he tells him that ""You and I both shook Sinatra's hand, and there's a code among the guys who shook Sinatra's hand."" The image of ""Ol' Blue Eyes"" (who also starred in the 1960 original) still looms large in Las Vegas. Whether it was his classy song stylings or his purported mob connections, the man owned that town. So when the swindler rudely replies ""Screw Sinatra's hand,"" you know that Willy Bank will not long rule in the kingdom of cool.<br/><br/>Pacino and Barkin, who burned up the screen in 1989's Sea of Love, make impressive villains and are welcome additions to the company. With a cast this stellar and a master filmmaker at the helm, there's no need to worry too much about the story. Just enjoy some of today's biggest stars in their best Armani duds as they swagger through the streets of Sin City.<br/><br/>One or two of the subplots add interest, especially Bank's obsessive desire to gain a Five Diamond Award for his new operation. Sal Bloom (Reiner) poses as the evaluator, while the real rater (Paymer) is hilariously mistreated by some of the Ocean crew masquerading as hotel staff.<br/><br/>One quibble: A few more women in the cast wouldn't hurt, though I certainly have no complaints about Barkin; it's just that last time out we had Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones.<br/><br/>Next time, how about a prequel? Say Ocean's Five or Six, so I won't have to keep track of so many characters."

","Ocean's 11 was a brilliant combination of gripping detective, thrilling comedy and excellent love story, lifted on high by the dazzling array of great actors. Ocean's 12 was slightly worse, as the plot began repeating itself and some tricks did not work out again. Ocean's 13? C'mon, give me a break! What could be invented, if anything, this time? Especially, taking into account the sad fact that Julia Roberts would not take part in this part anymore, what will happen this time? Well, the film makers eliminated the love story altogether, which thinned the film really badly. Instead, in addition to the smashing team of Clooney, Damon, Garcia, Pitt and others, they invited the one and only Al Pacino as a red-haired, merciless and vile casino owner, greedy and devoid of any principles. This time, the Danny Ocean team decides to ruin his tasteless new casino and even combine their efforts with their deadly rival, Mr. Benedict. And then, a fountain of head-banging tricks, smart ideas and impossibly expensive gadgets starts pouring on us effortlessly for almost 2 hours. The classical glossy picture, smooth jazz background, elegant view of Ocean (who, in fact, is a very incidental character this time, leaving much more time and space to other heroes) leave very little time to think. The movie becomes a nice, tasty, easy to digest comic strip, almost stripped of any serious thought or psychological insight. What is also a pity; the heroes of Pitt and Damon also have less impact and time on the screen, although Damon's appearance as a womanizer at the later part of the film and his romance with Pacino's aid make the film very funny. Keep it in mind, Pacino's hero is impeccable. He is cold, vile, greedy monster, a real shark, and his appearance, his hairdo, his suits, his manners are superb. He is the real winner of the whole movie. Well, trequels become so fashionable that one may scratch in utter disbelief if a new port be added or not. I hope, they will not go on with Ocean's 14. That will be really too much of a good thing. But still, this movie left me quite pleased. At least, that was a swift, easy-going, sweet-tasting, laughter-provoking bubble gum. Pity, that could have been a far better try."

","I really liked part one and two of the ""Ocean's""-series and part three is ultimately the same film again. What makes the ""Ocean's""-films worth their price is their entertainment quality, which they take out of the interacting between their massive stars. One critic maintained that these films bring back the old habit of making films, which the viewer is watching for the stars and not the film itself. I mean, he is right to some extent, but if you're honest, that has always been the case. Why do big budget movies almost always have to have big names? They attract many viewers. The only difference is the impudent frankness with which Steven Soderbergh operates in his series, but when it's done with the right amount of self-irony as in ""Ocean's Thirteen"" it's only positive. What I remember is a funny, charming film with a great cast consisting of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Al Pacino. The minus point is, that it's a bit too male-dominated, but hey, I still like it very much."

This lands Reuben in hospital after a near fatal heart attack. After hearing of the deal, Danny and his crew decide to exact revenge on Banks by sabotaging the grand opening of his new venture. Perhaps what Ocean's Twelve lacked was the glossy (although admittedly tacky) aesthetic that Las Vegas rewarded the first film with. Because even when Ocean's Thirteen doesn't quite work, such as during the odd faux-romance scenes between Ellen Barkin and Matt Damon, at least the scenery jumps out at you. Yes Clooney, Pitt, Pacino and Soderbergh are way better than this - but the movie is fun, and in comparison with the utter mess that was Ocean's Twelve, it's nothing but a sprightly addition to a series that has probably run its course."

Her character is smart and hard-working and of course beautiful, as is she. But towards the end of the movie she's seduced by Matt Damon's character, though he's inexplicably disguised with slicked back hair and a large, hooked nose. The entire scene is played for laughs - Damon's character is using a love potion called The Gilroy (an inside joke, one of many, about screenwriter Tony Gilroy) to overwhelm Barkin's character with lust. What I don't understand is why they decided to go this way. Both Barkin and Damon are gorgeous and sexy, and a genuine seduction scene between them would have been smokin' hot. Instead Barkin acts drunk and Damon acts inept, and it's all rather insulting and painful to watch. And to take this amazing woman, who's been a force in cinema for 3 decades, and make her the butt of a really juvenile joke, well, it diminishes the whole enterprise. Shame on them."

He also wants to win a prestigious ""5 diamond"" award, given only to the top of the top of luxury hotels worldwide by some important organization. As with the previous movies, it's interesting to see how the guys plan everything to achieve their revenge. The only thing about this sequel is the implausibility of certain events. Where as OCEANS 11, as outlandish as it was, exposed the heist within credible parameters, this time around some things look like right out of a comic book strip. For instance, why would the gang GO to Terry Benedict for help? In the first movie, Benedict was portrayed as a ruthless, almost homicidal casino owner. You really had a fear of him and, after what Danny Ocean and his gang did to him, I doubt he would ever have use for any of them. Well, this time the gang asks Benedict to finance the heist, just because Willy Bank's hotel casts a shadow over Benedict's hotels. And some of the devices used this time around look like out of the latest FANTASTIC 4 movie. <br/><br/>As with previous films, this is not a fast paced auctioneer, and the real deal here is to enjoy the subtleties, the way the gang plans and executes the heist. I really enjoyed this, if somewhat unbelievable sequel, and I laughed real hard!"

","The third installment in director Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's"" saga. This time Elliott Gould is nearly frightened to death with strong-arm tactics by crazed casino magnate Al Pacino. Thus our cast of demented heroes come together to get even with Pacino and his top assistant (Ellen Barkin). Cleverly conceived flick by the all-world director does not waste much time with exposition, but rather starts the ball rolling and does not let up until the end. Could have worked as a silent picture just as well as one with sound. Soderbergh continues to amaze me with his risk-taking film-making techniques. To me, it is like he is just experimenting here with ""Ocean's 13"" and not even trying to make a cinematic masterpiece. It is fun and highly unique in its own special way and it matches the substance and style of the second installment and also compliments the original well. David Paymer is priceless in a short part as a critic who has his share of problems. 4 stars out of 5."
"karthik-globalsoul","7","0","2","21 July 2007"," Ocean's 13 - getting even is not odd... :)
","(Karthik Narayan) <br/><br/>What are the odds of getting even? <br/><br/>No, not a question, it's the tag line of Ocean's 13, the latest movie in a long list of sequels that Hollywood directors have been pouring in this year  Spiderman 3, Shrek 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 not to forget Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>After a disastrous Ocean's 12, the sequel had to very good to draw in the audience. So chopping and changing was required. The difference can be felt. The movie has an odd beginning  with Reuben falling into a dizzy after being cheated in a business deal by Bank (Al Pacino). Reuben banks on Danny Ocean and his team to get revenge.<br/><br/>Like in Ocean's 11 (the first movie of this series), this movie is also all about the ingenuity that this team can never fall short of. Being chronologically, technologically and logically well advanced, they go on to rig Bank's ultra hi-fi casino and ruin him.<br/><br/>Naturally money is a high value factor in the scheme of things and after the fiasco in Ocean's 12, the team runs out of money and seeks their old enemy, Benedict (Andy Garcia) to pitch in. Benedict, always the selfish double-crosser that he is, looks for more than a mere lending-returning transaction. Danny and team are forced to steal the diamonds in Banks' secret vault (even though they don't want to). Benedict hires Toulour (the Frenchman who torments Ocean in Ocean's 12) to steal it before Ocean can.<br/><br/>How Danny's ever increasing army of thieves baffles everyone and still manages not to get caught forms the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The best part about the Ocean series of movies is that it doesn't have violence or abusive language (Yes, this movie will not win an Oscar for best script-writing!); there is no fist clenching and definitely no guns (though there are lots of Big Guns, if you know what I mean), except in the end when Toulour fools Linus (Matt Damon) with an empty gun barrel.<br/><br/>The entire series always has belonged to Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney (who no doubt is aging but looks cool). I haven't seen an Al Pacino movie, so I can't comment on his acting as ""Bank"", but there isn't much anyway for him. There is no big female lead this time  no Julia Roberts, no Catherine Zeta Jones.<br/><br/>Following a little custom that we saw in Ocean's 11, (Lennox Lewis did a cameo) this time it's Oprah Winfrey with a surprise end to the movie that is worth waiting for.<br/><br/>Of all the sequels that were released this year, I would say this movie would rank among the better few.<br/><br/>My mom doesn't believe in Hollywood movies  to her, its all violence and nothing else. But I am going to ask her to watch Ocean's 11-13 to make her believe it's not always violent and intellect does remain in the movie world! <br/><br/>And yes, the movie tag line is a pun on its title, in case you didn't get it already!"

","The Ocean's film have always been about harmless but charming and glamorous fun, with some excellent acting, funny dialogue, crisp set ups and great behind the camera work on multiple levels by the crafts people on the films. Their weakest links have always been the scripts, which were always good on the funny bits and what created the bonds between the actors. However, with this third version was the script. The drill bit part, the Mexican labor camp revolution, the threat which forces the need for the revenge which is the basis of the film, etc.<br/><br/>I actually liked the second film more than this one, the big problem I had with it was that Catherine Zeta Jones just got too far too fast into Rusty's caper (and purely to advance the plot of that movie) and the entire Julia Robert's pregnancy bit. This one has no major flaws like that one, just a collection of minor ones.<br/><br/>However, it's still fun and enjoyable and if you don't mind not straining yourself at all, you should be able to enjoy it. Recommended as a matinée or a rental."

","I was highly skeptical about O13. Ever since the disappointment of O12, I surmised that this series is finished. Soderburgh did not have anything more to give with regards to Danny Ocean and his crew. How wrong I was. He produced the greatest trick up his sleeve. His Ace, Al Pacino. Putting Al Pacino as a negative character as well as Andy Garcia as a pseudo negative role, Soderburgh wins over the audience.<br/><br/>O13 has the simplest of all plots. Something that any man can relate to. One of the eleven is bullied out of his own plans to make a hotel (Elliout Gould) by a high flying business man, known as dirtiest player in his game,(Al Pacino). He bullies Reuben Tishkoff from his own dreams, which results in his heart attack, and he is admitted to a hospital. So, the eleven conspire to take him down, and they put up with a plan that is a dream of every casino goer. They create an atmosphere for 3.5 minutes where every player in the casino wins. Admittedly however vague and idiotic it sounds, they do this very well, and that brings about a smile in your face.<br/><br/>Like in the first movie it was Danny Ocean(George Clooney), Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt) in the second its Linus Caldwell's (Matt Damon) turn for lady luck. His part is a assistant/secretary for a rich Japanese client,(Shaobo Kin) as well as a translator. He seduces Al Pacino's right hand man or rather woman, Abigail Sponder.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, this one has a detailed plot, with a slick way to steal the cash off. In the end, when Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia) tried to pull one over them, they fool him over once again. There's a small cameo by Vincent Cassel although I hardly felt it was necessary. Maybe Soderburgh was thinking of ending this trilogy with this one, but I hardly think he succeeded in doing that. You cannot end Ocean's trilogy without Julia Roberts and Catherine-Zeta Jones. For all those who are moaning their absence from this movie, Danny Ocean makes it a point that they would not be involved in this heist since it was a matter of avenging their friend and not any normal job.<br/><br/>The acting yet again is superb. Geroge Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon who are the lead roles in this movie are really good. Especially Matt Damon, who gets a bit of extra reel space due to his supposed affair with Ellen Barkin's character. The rest of the crew, Elliout Gould, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, Shaobo Kin, Scott Caan and Eddie Jameson all have small parts that they do with perfection. Elliout Gould does a fine job of playing the guy in bed, unattached from the world. Don Cheadle, is the one preparing the huge magnetic device, who has a finer aspect of character of writing a poem for the bed ridden Reuben Tishkoff, to help him feel better. The usual animosity between the Malloy brothers, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan is missing, but even then working together for a change they do a fine job of it. Carl Reiner and Shabo Kin probably has the smallest of parts in the movie. Shaobo Kin's role is basically a rich Japanese aristocrat who orders Linus Caldwell about. Carl Reiner posing as a undercover agent for the 5-Star Diamond Awards also has little to offer. Eddie Jameson does a great job solving the codes for the blackjack and working as an employee in Al Pacino's(Willy Banks) hotel. But lastly, no one is more brilliant than Bernie Mac. He basically has 2 scenes to his credit. And even in those 2 scenes he stands out brightly.<br/><br/>O13 is certainly not the best movie of the year, but it certainly is not the worse. It's a fun watch, but when is Danny Ocean and his crew not fun to watch !!!! The direction is good, the acting like always is up to a very high level. The cinematography is good, the background score very nice, special effects though used scantily was also superb. All in all 8/10 !!!"

If you ask me, the production design was absolutely spectacular, the performances were top grade, the cast was well chosen, and the direction was excellent. I just love Steven Soderbergh films, despite the fact I've only seen four of his movies. Those four movies are ERIN BROCKOVICH, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, OCEAN'S TWELVE, and this one. Also, I especially loved the costumes. They were really well designed in my opinion. The elevator shaft and natural disaster sequences made me a little dizzy.

","Out of all of the movies I've seen in the past year, this rated up there with the best of them. In this one, the guys get back to focusing on pulling the heist rather than on also chasing the women. The result is that it seems all of the characters were given a bit more of the spotlight, which I think added greater depth to the story. Unlike 12, Thirteen spent must of its time in one or 2 locations, and the consistency of the setting I think added to the cohesion of the script. It was also fun to see how they worked in many of the minor characters from the two previous movies. I was entertained from start to finish, and nowadays that is what I consider to be mark of a very good movie."

","One by one they creep up and will soon reach some magic number, though 13 is already interesting but more on the side of witchcraft than magic. The idea is always the same: to make a break-in or a burglary that is by principle impossible. In this case the impossibility is some extremely sophisticated digitalized security system protecting a casino in Las Vegas. How can a bunch of burglars manage to enter the system and pervert it in order to get even with the boss of that casino who was not honest with a partner that he forced into bankruptcy and retirement, with a good heart attack along with it. The vengeance is absolutely savage and wild. And that is absolutely brilliant, though of course impossible. The plot is just tinkering about to get to the target and objective and that is all. No real logic, no real meaning, no real believability. The more far-fetched, the better. And more than far-fetched it is at times. And yet here and there, there is a punch-line or a remark that is tilting the scales towards some meaningfulness, like the strike in Mexico for a 3.5 dollar rise a week, but it is evanescent and quick, like a good big wink at the audience, if they are not too far gone away in their intellectual slumber. So the vengeance is of course consumed and reached totally. The bad casino boss is pushed down the stairs, loses five hundred millions and three or four sets of two hundred and fifty million dollar each diamond necklaces. All together he must have lost in about ten minutes something like 1.5 billion dollars. Funny but where is the moral of the story? The editing and the plot are a little bit slow and the film seems to be slightly sluggish at times.

","The latest movie in this summer of the sequel is a departure from the first three heavyweights of ""Spider-man 3"", ""Shrek the Third"", and ""Pirates 3"". Aimed more at adults than adolescents, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is the clean-up hitter this summer. In baseball, a clean-up hitter usually has power. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" has star power, perhaps more than any other release this summer, and the movie wields its weapons well.<br/><br/>While Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones are not back for this installment, all the men of ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Ocean's Twelve"" do reprise their roles. George Clooney and Brad Pitt head up the gang of thieves, aided by Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and the rest of the crew that moviegoers have come to know over the last six years. The biggest addition to the cast is a name bigger than all of them, and his character is the catalyst for the caper that drives the entire film. The man is Al Pacino, playing a flashy casino owner who incurs the gang's wrath by betraying Elliott Gould's Reuben Tishkoff, setting the stage for the rest of the revenge movie.<br/><br/>The first film was a modern classic that thrived on the energy of Las Vegas and the cool confidence of Clooney and Pitt. Twelve lost much of those factors by bouncing around Europe and putting the band of thieves on the run. Thirteen returns to the franchise's successful roots, taking place predominantly in the colorful world of Sin City and also placing the heroes in control most of the time.<br/><br/>In restoring those two key elements, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" recaptures the spirit of the original. The dialogue isn't as crisp or smart, but it's close, and elements of the past glory are present. Things like con-man lingo and everyone bilingually communicating with The Amazing Yen provide well-done unexplained humor. Writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien (who penned quality guy flicks like ""Rounders"" and ""Knockaround Guys"") do overuse the borrowed elements, as though they decided to repeat the good parts of the original's script as often as possible, and the resulting jokes wear a bit thin over the course of the movie.<br/><br/>Returning to Vegas is a wise choice that simplifies the plot. Though staples of heist movies, like double-crosses and sleight of hand, are present, the story is largely straight forward. You know what the guys are going to do; you're just watching to see how the crew overcomes the various inevitable obstacles. This makes it slightly less entertaining, but also makes for a very comfortable viewing experience, despite the required suspension of disbelief. The cinematography of Steven Soderbergh (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) helps too; the pictures and transitions are not to the impressive level of ""Eleven"", but they have their moments, as do the quirky uses of titles and graphics.<br/><br/>As is the case in many sequels, the cast slides effortlessly back into their roles. Clooney and Pitt are smooth; Damon is trying to prove himself; Bernie Mac is a fast-talker, etc. As the new guy, Pacino effectively joins the fray with a surprisingly underplayed part. He's not the big, bold, brash near-caricature that he has morphed into through movies like ""Scent of a Woman"" and ""The Devil's Advocate"". He still looks the over-the-top part with his deep tan and vibrant suits, but he is more kniving than bombastic, which is a very appropriate choice for the movie.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Thirteen"" is the cinematic version of a lazy river ride at a water park. You hop in your inner tube and cruise around the lengthy pool, admiring the view, chatting with friends, and generally enjoying the laid-back experience. Unlike many of this summer's blockbusters, it does not bombard you with loud effects or action scenes. It won't shock and awe you by pulling wool over your eyes with a mind-blowing twist. Instead, gentle turns and reveals are sprinkled throughout, providing an enjoyable two hours spent with familiar and entertaining characters.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A good summer diversion that returns to the roots of the series. Not as good as the first, but better than the second. 7 of 10."

I liked that the plot was more involved, and that different characters, such as Karl Reiner's character, had more of a part. It was great to see Pacino, and the references to Sinatra were classic: ""Screw Sinatra's hand..."" which causes Reuben to have a heart attack. :) Also a great way to scam Andy Garcia's character, and then he has no choice but to accept it!

","Ocean's 11 was not the type of film to warrant a sequel but given the pure fun the original crew had it only made sense that they'd come back to do it again. But a third installment seemed almost mundane. How could they possibly make a third installment worth while?? Well they get continued points for once again bringing back the majority of the original cast minus almost all estrogen (Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, and pretty much any females at all.) But the core cast is back and after the rather disastrous mess of Ocean's 12 which took the heart of the film away by setting it outside of Vegas they manage to go back to what made the original film great...big Hollywood stars, having a good time, in Vegas, pulling the con of a life time and that makes Ocean's 13 worth while and stunningly saves the series. Steven Soderbergh returns for a third time as director and I think by now the entire cast should just know each other and how the script works. Granted Ocean's 13 isn't exactly a huge stretch from what was already Ocean's 11 and I'll still stand by the fact that I don't a trilogy was necessary but as luck would have it Ocean's 13 is actually very watchable and a lot of fun.<br/><br/>George Clooney returns as the head of the crew...Danny Ocean. He definitely recaptures more of that suave, smooth, and cunning Danny Ocean from the original that was completely lost with the second. Working by his side again is his crew that all have a purpose again this time around. Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Shaobo Qin, Carl Reiner, and Eddie Jemison. In the original their purpose was clear cut and exact and in Ocean's 12 there was no need for half of them and finally with Ocean's 13 most of them have a very important role even if it feels a little forced at times. Most of all they just want to be there to help avenge Reuben, played again by the terrific Elliot Gould. They even found a way to bring back Andy Garcia in a small role as Ocean's number one adversary Terry Benedict. The addition to this cast was the irreplaceable and incredible Al Pacino as Willie Bank, the tough as nails, egotistical scum bag casino owner who screws over Reuben (Gould.) Pacino just ups the ante on any cast and he fits right in with the Ocean's team. The only female to the cast is that of Ellen Barkin as Pacino's right hand gal Abigail Sponder. She is supposed to be tough and ruthless but in fact she comes across as mostly whiny and annoying and gets in the way so she doesn't really fill the shoes well of Roberts or Zeta Jones.<br/><br/>I give great credit to Soderbergh and the writers of Ocean's 13 because they came up with a really good and interesting and fun concept as opposed to simply 'yet another heist.' The whole unique plot to the team was what made this film different from Ocean's 11 and watchable...again. Still it was far from perfect and at this point so much of it just seemed forced and unnecessary and for the love of Ocean please stop it at a trilogy because there is nothing more that can be milked out of these characters. Danny Ocean on his own?? Perhaps but not the 11, or 12, or 13...this series has definitely played it's course. But if you're a fan of the original Clooney version than you need to definitely see Ocean's 13 because of the two sequels this one is heads and tails above Ocean's 12. 7.5/10"

""Ocean's 13"" is a great return to form of ""11"" after the disappointment of the second film. All the fun one-liners, the chemistry between the cast, and the smart script are back, and even better than before. <br/><br/>This time around, Rueben helps casino tycoon/bad guy Willie Bank (a wonderfully evil Al Pacino) design and build the ultimate casino. But when the time comes to open it, Willie strikes Rueben out of his share of the money, which results to Rueben having a heart attack. This angers Ocean and his ten heist-planning pals, so they devise a plan to sabotage the opening night of the hotel and avenge Rueben. <br/><br/>The best parts are watching the characters sabotage everything, from fixing slot machines to win jackpots at certain times, to fake earthquakes, and even annoying a hotel critic (David Paymer) to hilarious results, while posing as a various hotel employees.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this film is the actors. Everyone and more is back excluding Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Julia Roberts who are only mentioned in passing reference. Personally I'm glad they're not back. It's an ensemble piece so everyone has to be good, and everyone very much are. Among the best are Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, and many others. The best though are of course George Clooney and Brad Pitt, the chemistry between them is amazing and hilarious to watch. <br/><br/>Kudos also go to the writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien who wrote a smart, complex, and witty script, and director Steven Soderbergh (who also did the cinematography, and produced it) who crafted a sharp, enjoyable film. My one complaint is that it is a tad confusing at times, but by the end, everything makes sense.<br/><br/>This is a great film, and even better film-making.

","Ocean's 13 is the ending of one of the most successful series in recent years, and it finishes it off much the same as the rest of the films: fun, tricky, and completely free of deeper meaning or value.<br/><br/>I am a fan of both of the previous Ocean's films. I seem to be just about the only person who really enjoyed Ocean's 12, but I thought it was probably the funniest of the three. Ocean's 11 definitely remains the best of the group, as well it should, and 13 is probably my least favorite. But that doesn't mean it wasn't any good. It was fun and funny throughout.<br/><br/>The story is simple- at least for an Ocean's movie. One of the gang, Reuben falls deathly ill after being screwed over by Vegas tycoon Willy Banks (Al Pacino). Therefore the crew set out to destroy Willy by making his newest and grandest casino (the one he was supposed to share with Reuben) a flop. And they pull out all the tricks, some ingenious and some just absurd.<br/><br/>The film was fine, and that was all. I didn't leave it raving or excited, but I also certainly didn't leave it disappointed. Except for one thing: Neither Julia Roberts nor Catherina Zeta-Jones was present for this film, and that was disappointing as they were my favorite parts of the other two film. Without them, the guys are just okay entertainers in my opinion. I will say, though, that Ellen Barkin did a wonderful job in her (unfortunately) small part. Of the guys, Matt Damon was probably my favorite.<br/><br/>So, the Ocean's films end with satisfaction and humor along for the ride. I don't really understand the raving that this one was so much better than the others, because, in my opinion, they're all on the same level.

But hearing and reading the reviews of this movie convinced me to invest in this sequel(amongst a summer of high profile sequels),and I'm pretty happy I did. As for my summary line,after seeing this offering,a sequel doesn't seem like such a bad idea anymore.<br/><br/>The story is probably tighter than the previous two movies: Casino owner and LAs Vegas old guard Reuben Tishkoff(Elliott Gould)has a massive heart attack when he is basically swindled by an over-aggressive casino entrepreneur named Willie Bank(Al Pacino,dialing it down to be as dry and quietly menacing as he is unscrupulous). News travels relatively quickly to Tishkoff's friends,aka the gang from the previous fixes: Danny Ocean(George Clooney,really smooth,even for himself),Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt,not even needing deodorant for this film!),Linus Caldwell(Matt Damon,resting up for the third Bourne movie),Livingston Dell(Eddie Jemison),Frank Catton(Bernie Mac,in a role he seems born to play),BAsher Tarr(Don Cheadle,happy to take lighter stuff as always),Yen(Shaobo Qin,doing a little more than neat stunts this time),the Malloy brothers(Scott Caan and CAsey Affleck)and Saul Bloom(Carl Reiner,as sharp as ever at 85),and they all agree to enact revenge on Bank. It's ultimately agreed upon that the best revenge on Bank is to sink his brand new casino hotel,and the plot to do so is set into a looming,looping,exacting motion,as usual.<br/><br/>Featuring some fairly inspired secondary performances by Ellen Barkin(as BAnk's sexy,exacting assistant),Eddie Izzard(As a new investor to bankroll Ocean),Robert Einstein(aka ""Super""DAve Osborne,as a Vegas gaming fed),David Paymer(as an unassuming-looking hotel reviewer who's about to have one of the lousiest hotel stays of his life)and Andy Garcia(back as one-time and possibly future nemesis,Casino boss Terry Benedict),this movie moves in brisk,sharp,clean strokes,complete with set-up,enactment and completion,all documented in an efficient,multi-screened stream of events. Director Steven Soderberg doesn't seem to care that elements of the film seem either vague or rough,preferring to allow the film-goer either take it or leave it as a finished product. Some may not care for it,I didn't mind it at all. Where ""Eleven"" was stylish and almost ruthless in its style,and ""Twelve"" had a promising set-up and effortlessly likable first half undermined by an utterly confusing last half,this movie returns to the original formula for the most part,and to me,the best parts of this film may also be what makes it less than perfect:that is,it's easy flow,quickness and lack of interest in the core details of the job. Still,I can let it go if a movie about a massive con isn't interested in plying the whole craft before the viewer as long as said movie still keeps it entertaining and quick,and I'm happy to say ""Thirteen"" does just that."

","Like a rehabilitated version of its two retarded brothers, *Ocean's Thirteen* is still eye-candy (primary colors and insatiable set dressing screams at us within the opening five minutes), it is still big band bop underscoring a lavish, hedonist production, it is still man-toys squirming their taut butts through unutterably outlandish scenarios  but this time 'round, the direction is wiser, the plot is tighter and some of the jokes are actually funny.<br/><br/>My expectations going into *Thirteen* were not high  the Sequel Syndrome, I believed, would eat this production alive as soon as it was greenlit. You know the syndrome  you've seen it spiral out of control with every ""blockbuster"" (how I hate that word) from *X-Men* to *Pirates*; brace yourself for a dumber summer.<br/><br/>So when director Steven Soderbergh fills his first act with ""past tense"" sequences, showing us the Setup of this heist, I thought we were in for it  now, not only will the *heist* be in past tense (as in *Ocean's Eleven* and *Twelve* - where man-toys spend inordinate wrap time explaining every detail which we didn't really miss, but were never shown in the first place)  we're also gonna get the Setup and the Formula and the Solution and everything goddam else in past tense as well! Bluster for luster.<br/><br/>But then  salvation!<br/><br/>The story (by Brian Koppelman and David Levien) soon emerges after the first act's unnecessary smash-cutting. Slamming with the scamming without too much glamming. And hooks us - by crook! Reuben (Elliott Gould  one of Danny Ocean's ""Eleven"") has been taken for an investment ride by devious veteran hotelier, Willie Bank (Al Pacino, super-cool, super-cruel, taking over where Andy Garcia left off), leaving Reuben bedridden from a major heart attack. Both Reuben and Bank have ""shook Sinatra's hand""  a milestone which should forge a tacit bond between them  so Bank's betrayal is doubly grave, which prompts Ocean (once again, George Clooney) and his Eleven (nay, Remaining Ten, featuring The Damon, The Pitt, The Cheadle *et al*) to seek revenge. In the only way they know how  through a major con.<br/><br/>The boys reconvene in Las Vegas to destroy Bank insidiously, by fixing all the games on opening night in his new super-high-roller casino and busting him. To do this, they must of course pull the most convoluted machinations and confidence tricks this side of Houdini. Usually when heist movies show us ""how it's done"" we marvel at how easy it is and why more people aren't heisting, but when the *Ocean's* films show us, it looks so hard and expensive that it's not worth the effort. <br/><br/>There are a host of funny subplots: David Paymer as a V.U.P. (Very Unimportant Person)  a hotel critic mistaken for a regular guest; Casey Affleck and James Caan cause comedic mayhem inciting wage riots at a Mexican dice plant, while Damon seduces Pacino's right-hand woman, Abigail (Ellen Barkin, whose breasts are really barkin'). After twenty minutes of seduction - where Abigail is uncontrollably crawling over Damon's big-nosed character due to a ""Gilroy"" aphrodisiac  she still hasn't shimmied out of her low-cut, sheer, skin-hugging red dress. Are they Iowa teenagers to keep necking that long without nakedness? (Barkin's lucky her breast-aug is so tantalizing, cos she's always had a face that looks like it took second place in a lemon-sucking competition.) <br/><br/>Eddie Izzard  Brit-suave and clinical-cool - is brought in as a kind of super-crim consultant, for the super-security-computers Bank's casino boasts.<br/><br/>Vincent Cassell returns as the skulking Night Fox, his presence just screaming Euro Double Cross. Rest assured, the twists are not annoyingly smug  they straighten themselves out after their initial jolt. <br/><br/>One of the more ironic twists is the inclusion of Andy Garcia in the Eleven's roster, who, along with Izzard, gives us the titular ""13."" Playing smarmy Benedict again (the hotelier the Eleven heisted in *Twelve*), slicker than an Exxon oil spill, Garcia on screen with Pacino is a heady nostalgia  their last on screen pairing in the ill-remembered, yet gloriously-powerful *Godfather Part III.* <br/><br/>Speaking of *The Godfather,* Reuben paraphrases from his sick bed, ""I hear cars driving up to the house, I hear Linus crying  why don't you tell me what everyone seems to know."" The last scene reverberates with in-jokes: Clooney to Pitt, alludes to (dare I say it?) Brangelina: ""Settle down, have a coupla kids,"" while Pitt in return alludes to *Syriana*: ""Keep the weight off between jobs.""<br/><br/>It might seem redundant to note, but this time round, there is much more ""cheating""  by the film-makers! After describing the maddeningly precise security systems, when Pitt pays off a concierge or when Caan replaces a dumpling with a spiked one, suddenly those security systems see nothing. The security is impossible to subvert when the Eleven decry it, but when they have to actually ""get away"" with something, the security is as useless as it is in the real world. <br/><br/>I was glad the chicks were M.I.A.  Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones; there are one-line explanations for each, explaining their absence. (How must that make them feel? Not too indispensable, I bet.) Let's face it  Vegas is a MAN'S town; we really don't want the spouses sniffing around. And a heist is a MAN'S game; the only roles women ever play in heists are *objects d'sex* (and the Eleven have Brad Pitt for that) and maybe squeezing into tiny airducts where men can't fit (and they have Shaobo Qin for that).<br/><br/>This beyond-lavish production has renewed my faith in the ensemble power of man-toys  and it only helps that the spirit of Sinatra somehow imbues this entry more so than even *Eleven* (2001). I wrote that *Thirteen* would be the new Zero. It's not  so maybe *Fourteen* will be the new *Godfather Part II.*"

","This film was great, i've seen POC 3 and Spiderman 3 and was immensely disappointed after all of the hype and great looking trailers. This film really lived up to its expectations, i mean anything would have been better than oceans 12 (dare i bring up the catastrophe of Julia Roberts pretending to be.....JULIA ROBERTS!!?) Al Pacino was amazing and Eddie Izzard proved to be a great addition to this ensemble cast.<br/><br/>The more personal elements that were brought into it, through the gang supporting Reuben after Banks ripped him off really added more layers to a movie that could have been shallow.<br/><br/>I just wish that from Oceans 11 they hadn't given Cheadle that awful ""cockney"" accent, now i'm just being picky!!<br/><br/>2 massive thumbs up!!!!"
"dfranzen70","7","0","1","17 June 2007"," Much better than Twelve - fun, funny thriller
","The really good news is that Ocean's Thirteen is completely enjoyable. I mean, after the crap effort of Ocean's Twelve, who could expect anything, well, good? The last one just felt like a bunch of buddy celebs getting together from some yuks and a good ol' time. But Thirteen tries very hard to make you forget Twelve ever happened, and it largely succeeds.<br/><br/>This time around, the boys are out to avenge their good pal Rueben (Elliot Gould), who's been doublecrossed by the nefarious Willie Bank (Al Pacino). Reuben invested heavily in Bank's new, colossal casino in Vegas, but then Bank screwed Rueben out of his share, defrauding him of zillions. The general plan that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has come up with is to ruin Bank's opening night on many levels - fix games, cause natural disasters, steal his diamonds, make sure the casino reviewer has a bad time, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Gone are the self-indulgent overtones of Twelve, as the series returns to its roots as a crisply written caper punctuated by self-effacing performances and a wild, yet not implausible, plot. And, even better, there are times when I actually laughed out loud. I know! Whoda thunk that? The good news is that through three movies, the main characters haven't changed; they haven't grown, they're not evolving into higher beings, nothing. They are simply who they are. Danny is the leader, a man cool under pressure but not smugly so - kind of like George Clooney offscreen, come to think of it. Well, from what I've heard. Rusty (Brad Pitt) is still his right-hand man. Linus (Matt Damon) appears to be #3, but he's just as much of a doofus as he's always been (this time around, his father makes an appearance). Most of the other guys - including the timeless Carl Reiner as Sol - get short shrift, but whaddya gonna do when you have eleven, twelve, whatever, guys? They can't all get the good lines.<br/><br/>One pleasant surprise is that Pacino reins himself in a bit. He's not all eyes-bugging-out mad, like he was in Scarface, or Devil's Advocate, or Any Given Sunday, or a million other movies; no, he's more laid back, but totally in control. Apparently Pacino was the guy that director Steven Soderbergh wanted all along, and he does a damn good job - it's always good to see Al being a Good Actor instead of a ham. Along for the ride is another name actor, Ellen Barkin, who I'm told once was pretty attractive. At any rate, she's Bank's right-hand woman, a sort of Team Evil counterpart to Rusty; Barkin's Sponder is punctual, efficient, and poured into a slinky breast-baring (almost) dress at all times. Arm candy never hurts, thinks Bank. But beware! For some reason Soderbergh gives us a couple of closeups of Barkin. Hide the children! Or use the opportunity to warn them about the dangers of plastic surgery.<br/><br/>Okay, enough Barkin bashing, and back to the story. Ocean has all of the angles covered, but at the eleventh hour he finds himself in need of major fundage. Everyone's tapped out, of course, so to whom can they turn but Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the entrepreneur that the Ocean gang beat in the first two films. It's good to see Garcia, and at least his character's appearance here isn't contrived. Well, not too contrived - they didn't know anyone else who could spot them $36 million? Eh, guess not.<br/><br/>The one character who annoys me in these movies is Linus Caldwell. He's a pest to Danny and Rusty; although he supposedly has talents, he seems to spend a lot of time being a pain in the ass to everyone. When he comes up with an idea, everyone's shocked, and when he's supposed to be accomplishing something, he fails. At least here his noodginess is less obtrusive than it was in Twelve, when Linus actually ran a plan of his own device. I wonder if the character is supposed to be endearing, almost adorable in how inept he is - if so, though, then Damon really sucks, as the result is that I wish Linus would be killed off.<br/><br/>Still. Ocean's Thirteen is lots of fun, way more funner than Twelve, and it helps that the bad guy has a strong, pervasive personality that prevents predictability. I think that, as Soderbergh and Clooney have said, this one makes up for the crap that came before it."
"Corky1984","Null","0","1","17 June 2007"," Slick return to form for the Ocean's series
","After a pretty poor offering in Ocean's 12, the team have gone back to basics with this third film in the series. Danny Ocean and the usual suspects team up to try and swindle slimy casino baron Al Pacino, but this time it ain't just about the money. They want revenge after he'd betrayed their friend in a business deal. The whole movie was lively and snappy, not dragging at any point. Mixing humour with oodles of cool, it was all very entertaining. The twist involving Andy Garcia lending them money was a bit unrealistic, but made for a fun plot. Some of the card tricks etc were nothing we haven't seen before, but so what? A good film with plenty of action and plenty of laughs. Al Pacino was a bit over-the-top, but that suited the movie and it was good to see him back in a top-line picture after a couple of recent duds. Check it out."
"Bungle-9","7","0","2","10 June 2007"," Slick, cool, funny and fun - just what you ordered.
","I saw the first one, didn't see the second, then I saw this. It was a Sunday night out to the cinema, and I wanted something relaxed and entertaining. This film fitted the bill perfectly. It has Soderbergh's clear taste for style present with all his wonderful imagery and colour schemes everywhere, David Holmes' sassy soundtrack complimenting the cool subject matter and Eddie Izzard of all people!<br/><br/>The setup is a little hard to follow with some quick-cut editing and fast talking in the planning stage, but after that the rest runs as smooth as silk. Perhaps a little too smooth - some things seemed a little convenient and nothing seemed to go wrong, i.e. there was no sense of threat or danger. The ensemble cast is fantastic to see but they all seemed a little too comfortable and devoid of character (even Pacino) but these are the only things that seem to detract from this great piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>It's funny, both witty and slightly goofy, visually stimulating and downright cool and entertaining, just what the doctor ordered. I can't really compare this to the second one as I haven't seen it, but I really enjoyed this one."
