","There are few elements that actually work in this prequel, but none of them are enough to compensate for the lack of creativity, poor execution, terrible writing and awful looking special effects, ruining what it could've been a potentially promising spin-off from a great character."
"musica1","7","291","415","3 May 2009"," Wolverine isn't Bad, but it's not as good as it could've been
","I'll state my credentials up front: I'm a chick. I have read X-Men comics in my past, but it's been years. I don't remember every detail of every relationship and back story, so I'm not a huge X-men expert. I LOVED the original X-Men movie and X2.<br/><br/>I was so excited when I heard they were making a Wolverine movie. He and Gambit were my two favorite characters from the comics, and Wolverine was by far the best written and one of the best acted characters in the X-Men franchise. I thought, ""This should be good!"" I counted down the days until it came out. And I went to the theatre, and came out not disappointed, but not excited either. It was a middle-of-the-road movie, which seemed to not know what it wanted to be. But I would say go see it if you're an X-Men or Hugh Jackman fan.<br/><br/>The main crime committed in Wolverine is in the writing. I always say writers don't get enough credit on a good movie. But no amount of good acting (pretty much everyone in Wolverine does well with what they're given) and okay directing can cover up crappy writing like this. The script was all over the place. It didn't have any of the jaunty yet edgy feel of the first two X-Men movies. Wolverine's wisecracks and smart wit were all but forgotten. That would've maybe been okay if they had chosen to make Wolverine the dark, nearly evil character that he was supposed to have been before he lost his memory. But they didn't. He was neither good nor evil. This was ambivalent Wolverine. Kind of Emo Wolverine. Not above doing bad, but not really into it because it made him Feel Bad. No really interesting lines or plot points either way. The writers didn't seem to even know how to develop the relationship between Wolverine and Sabertooth. And was the love story put in by the studio just to satisfy us chicks who wouldn't go a see a comic-book movie without it? If so, the studio did us a great disservice, because if you wanted to make a story about Wolverine the lover (which, hey, I would go see), this movie wasn't that either. <br/><br/>And when I saw in the trailer that Gambit was in the movie, too, I was thrilled! Gambit in a movie, at last! But here he is, the underdeveloped and kind of confusing Gambit. Couldn't he at least have had his New Orleans accent? The cards were cool, but he was mostly underutilized and didn't feel like Gambit that much.<br/><br/>The movie does have some good moments in it where you actually say, ""Yes!"" I'm not putting spoilers, so I won't tell you what they are, but for me, they made the movie worth seeing. While I wouldn't put it anywhere on my worst-movie list, I wouldn't rank it with X-Men and X2 on my favorites list, either."
"DavidSim240183","9","63","91","8 May 2009"," Wolverine claws his way back on to the big screen
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine joins a whole host of films that's become a genre all its own in the last few years. An established film series taking a character back to its roots to reboot the series. Casino Royale, Batman Begins and the upcoming Star Trek are to name but a few examples. <br/><br/>If you were going to choose an X-Man to frame an origin story around, there is no one better than Wolverine. He's always been the most interesting character in X-Men. Perhaps because while all the others in the team use their mutant powers for the betterment of mankind, Logan's bad attitude makes him something of a wild card. One never to be entirely trusted.<br/><br/>I thought the idea of Wolverine getting his own movie was immensely exciting. Especially when Hugh Jackman agreed to reprise the role. And I'm pleased to say it was worth the wait. Quite a few have been quick to poke holes in the film's script, but I didn't feel disappointed with it at all. I felt it did Wolverine justice. Its a worthy addition to the series.<br/><br/>To side with a few nitpickers, 20th Century Fox and director Gavin Hood have taken a few liberties. Not just with the backstory, but also by breaking continuity with the other films in the series. For one, Logan's metal skeleton has always been the result of an experiment done to him against his will. But in Wolverine, here he willingly goes through with it, to get revenge on Sabretooth for killing his lover.<br/><br/>Also we get to meet a young Cyclops who runs into Logan. But no mention is made of that in the first film. They act like they've never met. Still, in spite of rewriting some of what we already know, Wolverine does a quite excellent job of bringing a lot of Logan's past into focus. All through a combination of Gavin Hood's involving, kinetic direction, David Benioff and Skip Woods' screenplay, and another excellent performance from the great Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>The opening credit sequence stayed with me more than anything else in the film. We watch as Logan and Sabretooth (half-brothers in this version) grow up and go to war. The Civil War. Both World Wars. Vietnam. And then finally they go to war on each other. They're both recruited by William Stryker (who you may remember from X2) to work in a special covert operations team. But while Logan and Sabretooth may seem similar, they are quite different.<br/><br/>They may be part animal, but Sabretooth likes it a lot more than Logan does. Nor does Logan share Sabretooth's love of killing. So when he strikes out on his own, how much are you willing to bet that it isn't long before Logan's past comes back to haunt him?<br/><br/>It didn't take me long at all to become enthralled in Wolverine's life history. Some people have criticised the idea of Logan and Sabretooth becoming brothers, but I felt it added an additional level of gravitas. It made Sabretooth's betrayal that much more potent. And I quite liked the way David Benioff and Skip Woods attempt to humanise Wolverine.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes in the film have nothing to do with large scale action sequences or revved up pyrotechnics. Some of the most touching and most moving moments is watching Wolverine trying to fit into a normal life. Away from wars and mortal enemies. And ultimately failing. His relationship with Kayla (nicely played by Lynn Collins), a seemingly ordinary human woman is quite affecting. Watching her take on the near impossible task of taming Logan's primal side is involving. Both Jackman and Collins shine in these scenes. Or the scene when Logan befriends an elderly couple. Who pay a terrible price for taking him in.<br/><br/>But Hood doesn't disappoint on the action front either. Wolverine has some breathtaking action scenes. Logan being chased by helicopter while on a bike is a real adrenaline pumper. And as it moves towards its climax, in a thrilling fight on top of a cooling tower, the film becomes something that makes you want to cry out for joy. This film really needs to be seen on a cinema screen. The photography of the Canadian Rockies provides a dazzling backdrop for the final fight. One suspects the film will lose a lot in the transfer when it goes to DVD.<br/><br/>The acting is all superb. Hugh Jackman is expectedly excellent. He dives into Logan's animal nature with pure, undiluted relish. But more importantly, he always knows the need to dial it down too, giving us that even more crucial chance to see inside the soul of Wolverine. I was a little wary to begin with when I learned Liev Schrieber would play Sabretooth. I just couldn't envision him in the role but he's a revelation. He brings a real meanness to the part. Something Tyler Mane never had in X-Men. You can see in his performance why it is that Logan hates him so much. The two have marvellous sparkage whenever they're paired together.<br/><br/>There are times when the film lapses perhaps too much into the realm of the comic book (I'm thinking of The Blob as I write this), but for the most part, Gavin Hood treats the material with the utmost respect. It ends on a shocking downer that also manages to tie in neatly with the first X-Men film. The script has many surprises that leaves you as jolted and embittered as poor Logan. A highly enjoyable film that exceeds all expectations, and the best X-Men adventure since X2."
"goods116","8","200","333","4 May 2009"," Much better than the reviews, actions packed FUN
","Forget the reviews that focus on dialogue (it's a comic book character, of course it's clich√©d) or other types of thing you may look for in movies like a Room With A View. In this movie you want to see cool action, cool use of superpowers, great fights with CGI that is not obvious and some tension about what happens next. This movie has it all. Academy awards? No. Amazing plot? No, but enough to keep it very interesting, with answers like where Adamantium comes from, Sabretooth and Wolverine relationship, introduction of Deadpool, early view of Cyclops, and much more that keeps the movie going along just fine. This is a solid action film, better than most."
"espunier","4","207","352","17 April 2009"," My expectations were too high
","All of the X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including the long hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best ones, in my opinion), and a good story arch.<br/><br/>I was all excited when I heard this movie was on production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, although you won't hear about this movie when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not what screws the movie up.<br/><br/>The whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot (like Blob or Gambit), which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics.<br/><br/>I am a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories and this movie respected none of them. None. Not even the continuity. It doesn't respect Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies: Revenge for the death of a loved one.<br/><br/>Oh. What I was expecting the whole darn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one he has in X2 in the school when Stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome Marvel hero.<br/><br/>Besides, I had a feeling of constant dej√° v√π with this movie because Wolverine's Origins are already explained in X2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know.<br/><br/>I personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back-story because mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker got his scars?"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","173","297","2 May 2009"," ""Wolverine"" 's journey is more about the visuals than the character
","The superhero genre reached a higher echelon in 2008 with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" and considering the success of 2/3 of the X-Men franchise so far, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" can certainly be held to those standards, especially a movie whose title alone suggests getting right down to its hero's adamantium core.<br/><br/>But ""Wolverine"" plays more like a spin-off, defining ""origins"" as the back story and not the psychological workings of the character. It's weak on themes, but loaded on more new mutants with new powers, explosions and plenty of subplots. Basically, it fails where ""X-Men 3"" did, trying to do too much at once, rushing the plot along and sacrificing the deeper reason audiences are drawn to Hugh Jackman's character other than he's cool and has a crude, sarcastic sense of humor. However, it succeeds much of the same way X3 did and beyond: more explosive action and creative use of an immense visual effects budget. Although director Gavin Hood doesn't bring more insight into the film with his work, he certainly has as good of an eye for the stylish as anyone.<br/><br/>The first sign that you know this movie isn't going to be top tier for superhero flicks is the number of mutants/villains. For a story about one, singular X-man, there are way too many other characters to follow: Col. Stryker is their ringleader, but Sabretooth (Schriber), Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Reynolds), Bolt (Monaghan), Gambit (Kitsch), Wraith (will.i.am), Agent Zero, the Blob and young Cyclops (not to mention a slough of extras) make the film dizzying. Especially at the beginning, we need to see more Wolverine -- it's his movie.<br/><br/>To the film's credit, its quick movement makes it easy to watch and entertaining and there's some surprisingly good comedic timing on Jackman's part for an action movie. Seriously though, it must have been a blast (no pun intended) on the set during action sequences because they actually destroyed everything they possibly could: CGI, real and both. This film is the beginning of what will surely be mind-blowing visual effects at the movies this summer. Hood gives new visual strength to the franchise and provides a much more epic feel to this film -- it's clearly about this grand journey for Wolverine, even if it's more spectacle than introspective.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the ending was the most satisfying part of the film. All the subplots converge, it makes sense and the loose ends that fans of the first three films will notice get tied up fittingly at the end. For the whole first hour of the film you're juggling Wolverine and Sabretooth's rivalry, Stryker's team of guys with powers, Wolverine's romance with Kayla out in the wilderness, what's happening to the team of guys with powers ... why the heck kid Cyclops is in the movie ... it's not overwhelming, it's just not as enjoyable when you can't focus on one thing or character as much as you'd like. Still, the ending justifies the strange means, at least in terms of the epic battle that ensues.<br/><br/>""Wolverine"" is not a travesty for the genre, but it certainly doesn't meet the expectations for a thorough superhero movie experience. You get amped up action and style over meaning and that makes it entertainment more than catharsis. Expect to be entertained and little else and ""Wolverine"" will satisfy your itch for the summer movie season. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"pyrocitor","4","389","695","1 May 2009"," ""I'm the best there is at what I do"" could hardly be further from the truth
","Like fellow 2009 superhero release Watchmen, Wolverine is that rare comic book film which almost appears inevitably more likely to please audiences that are not fans of the source material. However, unlike Watchmen, which adhered so closely to its source material that a falling short by comparison proved inescapable, Wolverine's inevitable backlash of fan outrage stems from its flagrant disregard for its source material. The film casually mutilates and re-writes the comic book context of its source material with the cold disdain of its protagonist, hacking one of the most genuinely compelling, subversive and horrifying superhero back-stories into the worst kind of safe, familiar, PG rated commercial dross. All of Wolverine's compelling comic book edginess is distilled into a flaccid script which forgoes exhilaration for only occasionally impressive fight/chase/explosion scenes, complexity for eye-rolling cheese and broad humour, and story cohesion for an attempt to cram in far too much subject matter and avoid the true dramatic meat of the story. <br/><br/>While further focus on the Wolverine/Sabertooth dichotomy could have yielded a narrative volumes stronger, the film continually broadens its scope, seemingly attempting to bank on the in-jokey winks to fans of the comics by hinting at broadening the Marvel universe in further sequels demonstrated in 2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But while their fan nods were tasteful and enjoyable, Wolverine's attempts at matching them appear to be building up to an almost sinister bid for Fox's superhero franchises to compete. Recognizable X-Men characters are continually shoehorned into minuscule parts (fans of Deadpool, Blob, Gambit or, *groan*, Cyclops don't go in expecting much but disappointment) for seemingly the sole purpose of leapfrogging off Wolverine's story into their own spin-offs. However, such an overflowing mass of secondary characters only serves the dual purpose of both derailing Wolverine's story and not even serving to satisfy comic fans clamouring to see their favourite characters on screen, as the fleeting, shallow depictions hardly prove satisfying character development by any stretch of the imagination. If the filmmakers choose to tackle established characters to appease fan expectations, doing nothing with the characters (let alone doing them far from 'properly') hardly seems a suitable way to satisfy a demanding audience. <br/><br/>Director Gavin Hood (known for excellent African drama Tsotsi of all things) has been vocal about his clashes with the studio over the film, and one can only assume, given his excellent credentials, that most of his proposed changes would have been for the better. As it is, Hood demonstrates a shaky directorial presence at best, masking his action scenes in whirling cameras making it near impossible to see, and complimenting most tense or dramatic scenes with a cascade of Harry Gregson-Williams' tiresomely banal and clich√©d musical score. That is not to say the film is entirely devoid of quality, but it is reduced to occasional fleeting moments (sporatic bursts of creativity during fight scenes, a promising African raid plot point, and an undeniably gripping if under-explored sequence of Wolverine going through the Weapon X program). But, like the irritatingly freeze-frame beset but otherwise clever opening montage (showcasing Wolverine's progression through numerous world wars) such quality is often overshadowed by cringe-worthy prevailing flaws making it all the more difficult to appreciate. <br/><br/>Ironically for the film situating him most justifiably in the lead role, Hugh Jackman gives his weakest performance in his foundational role as Wolverine. While Jackman's natural charisma and steely credibility still make him a far more sturdy enough lead than his film deserved, his under-exploring of Wolverine's feral ferocity and darkness still leaves an ultimately unsatisfying taste in the mouth. Despite initial skepticism of miscasting, Liev Schreiber proves far more resonant as Wolverine's animalistic adversary Sabretooth, providing a savagely threatening yet controlled performance, which, despite falling short of the true animalistic frenzy Sabretooth should have been, proves one of the more successful attributes of the film. Similarly, Danny Huston provides a welcome dash of class as Machiavellian military official William Stryker, managing to overcome the shortcomings of an underwritten character with an impressively realized, wonderful presence. Ryan Reynolds also proves perfectly cast as twisted mercenary Deadpool, thankfully managing to suppress star showiness in favour of suitably manic humour - nonetheless, Reynolds is criminally wasted in a far too brief and insultingly warped butchering of his comics incarnation. Taylor Kitsch, conversely, gives a bland, dopily flat take on fan favourite Gambit, the character's legendary suave charisma as nonexistent as Kitsch's Cajun accent, doing little to justify his character's near pointless addition. <br/><br/>While it may function suitably as mindless summer entertainment, the inherent complexity in Wolverine's backstory makes its reduction to such a near outright insult to fans of the comic source material. If left as a standalone film, Wolverine might have been dismissible as a mostly harmless disappointment, but with such blatant spin off begging, it evolves into something far more objectionable. While the film has its moments, as a cohesive unit it can be considered nothing less than a tragic waste of potential, floundering any inherent quality in gaping plot holes and unnecessary obvious comedy or ""tearjerking"" scenes. Wolverine's adage of him being ""the best I am at what I do"" could hardly be farther than the truth when applied to his film. <br/><br/>-4/10"
"LSGPhoenix","8","43","67","3 May 2009"," Fun and full circle
","Aside from all the nay-sayers, I truly enjoyed this film. It was as good as anyone could possibly do with a comic book character that has spanned volumes of books just to tell his story. Great job bringing the story to the real world, as well. Explaining the wars, the differences between Wolverine and Sabertooth, and doing it in a time line that the audience can accept and relate to. <br/><br/>The inclusion of Gambit and the small pieces of his story were also a plus. As well as leading directly into the beginning of the X-Men with the ""calling"" of Scott Summers. <br/><br/>All around I enjoyed this film. I felt it to be plenty entertaining, and had a good story all at the same time. Spend the money, sit back, and let yourself be entertained."
"xander7878","5","126","222","4 May 2009"," Fox makes another ""Not Bad"" movie
","I saw this movie over the weekend. When it was over, I kind of sighed, shrugged and said it was okay.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 5 which I think is pretty darn generous. Here's the positives of the movie. The actors are very good. Hugh Jackman, Liev, Ryan Reynolds are all very good actors, and each of them play their roles well. There was action, action, explosions, and more explosions. There certainly wasn't any shortage of eye candy. I think most Wolverine fans would probably like this movie.<br/><br/>Here's the negatives. We all learned the hard way when X-Men 3 came out, that Fox could seem to care less about the source material. They just want to make action moves with lots of special effects. Wolverine is a testament to that same disappointing philosophy. While Wolverine fans may like the movie, ""Marvel"" fans will probably feel a little ill.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that they haven't figured out yet why Marvel's movies are blockbusters (Iron Man, The Hulk), and thiers are always sub-par. Marvel uses good stories, acting, and smart witty scripts to keep us interested. Every half baked, killed off for the movie, or completely ruined character Fox throws in there just ruins the experience for a fan somewhere. Marvel may modernize the stories, but they respect the source material. Not only does that make comic fans happy, but the stories tend to make more sense, and have more relatable characters.<br/><br/>On a side note, the fact that Fox apparently has the rights to Deadpool makes me want to cry. Give it back to Marvel so we can get a decent movie, without blades coming out of his arms and lasers out his eyes."
"gabriel-80","10","111","196","6 May 2009"," Awesome - why are people complaining?!
","I have no idea as to why people bash Wolverine. I think its an extremely well made, highly entertaining movie with great acting and a fitting storyline. Its also pretty dark and uncompromising in many scenes.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are brutal and intense which makes them really awesome. <br/><br/>I was actually surprised by some of the plot twists. Great.<br/><br/>The opening title sequence should win some kind of award. Gave me goose bumps. The editing is perfect.<br/><br/>Only complaint is the few plot holes towards the X-men trilogy."
"idahovandalfan","7","170","308","2 May 2009"," Better than expected
","Wolverine is a decent movie. It is worth the price of admission and the 2 hours of screen time. The movie works well as a prequel of the events of the X-Men movies. However, to enjoy the movie, one must suspend knowledge of the comic book material. The movie was made for the average movie-goer and a little for the ultra hardcore X-Men comic book reader. The story has everything anyone could want: family, a little romance, love, comedy, revenge and plenty of action.<br/><br/>I was pleased with most of the acting. I will admit that some dialogue seems forced from the minor cast, but the main characters - Wolverine, Sabretooth, etc. - all work well together. The story did seem a little rushed and choppy at times, however. The 1:45 time goes by quickly enough to feel like maybe the movie could have - and should have - been closer to 2:00.<br/><br/>The movie is as good as the first X-Men movie, and better than X-Men United and X-Men: The Last Stand. I am actually looking forward to seeing how they handle the Magneto origins movie that's being made. And I am really hoping that all of this work brings it together for a possible X-Men 4. I know you agree with me because after all, I know everyone is dying to see Apocalypse as the bad guy.<br/><br/>My only real complaint of the movie is that Gambit (my favorite X-Men character) did not have as much screen time as I'd hoped. He better either get his own movie, or make an appearance in a later Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Ignore the syndicated critics and the negativity surrounding this movie. I'm glad I did. Go see it. Don't let people scare you away from spending your money on this movie. Form your own opinions. Oh, and if you go, stay after the credits."
"Sergio_Ivan_1985","8","38","62","3 June 2009"," so... what was the problem?
","With all the bad reviews as luggage, I came into this movie expecting the worst... but, after i saw it, i found myself both entertained and at the same time wondering what was the big problem every critic and fan boy seemed to have with this movie. I think i got it: they all got up in a bad mood in the morning, and, not wanting to be the odd guy out, set out to criticize every flaw this movie has. Which has plenty. But, again, what's the problem? it has the same flaws the previous three movies had: underdeveloped characters, uneven rhythm and a ludicrous plot that tries to handle a hell lot more than it can in just about an hour and a half of running time. But somehow, the first two movies get a pass from critics and fans alike, while ""the last stand"" and this one get ripped to pieces.<br/><br/>I mean, this movie has it's share of flaws, but has plenty to like too: Hugh Jackman plays this character he knows so well to perfection, as Liev Schreiber does with Sabretooth, the action scenes are nicely done, and quite exciting, an quite a lot. The rhythm picks up exactly when it needs too whenever it falls behind, etc.<br/><br/>People are even complaining about the quality of the effects which leads me to believe most of them saw nothing but the unfinished leaked version and, if they did attended the screening of the actual finished film, they didn't pay attention to it and instead, spend their time thinking ingenious ways how to use the title to mock the movie.<br/><br/>So, in a way, this is the ideal kind of movie: if you're looking for a fun unpretentious and well done, if not perfect, summer movie, this is it. But, if you're looking for a movie to complain about how Fox is the devil, this is it too. Choke on it."
"tom_koopa","8","33","53","11 May 2009"," Lots of action, drama, humor and... Wolverine
","X-men Origins: Wolverine is an enjoyable film. There's a bit of everything in this movie. Let me start with the characters.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is about Wolverine and Sabretooth. Makes sense, if you look at the title. How they grew up together, what kind of life they lived and how, in the end, they became two men who couldn't go through the same door ever again. Rivals till the end of time.<br/><br/>There isn't much room for the other characters in this movie, compared to Wolverine. I was a bit disappointed that both Gambit and Deadpool didn't get as much screen time as I had hoped. The same can be said for the other well-known x-men characters like the Blob or Emma Frost. They both have a minor role in this movie. Maybe that was done on purpose, since this IS a movie about Wolverine, but a little more screen time would have been nice of course.<br/><br/>The villain in this movie is none other then general William Stryker. If you are a X-men fan, you know him very well. Danny Huston plays a VERY good Stryker. You are really going to hate this character, if you haven't already by reading the comics, playing the games or watching the previous movies. <br/><br/>Action. TONS of it! A lot of cool stunts and daring moves. Motorcycles, cars, helicopters, explosions, gunfire and even a tank. This movie has spread the action nicely, since there aren't very long pauses between the action scenes. So if you are a fan of action, you will love this movie.<br/><br/>There's also a nice amount of humor in here. Hugh Jackman plays a great Wolverine once again and it paves the way for a few obvious and less obvious jokes. Gambit and the Blob add some humor as well. This movie is not as humorous as the previous 3 x-men movies, but it wasn't meant to be. This is the story about Wolverine's past, which is very dark and dramatic. So I'm glad they didn't add too much humor. It would have killed the atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>I found the acting quite good, with the exception of Gambit maybe. But that's because I cling myself too much to the cartoon version of Gambit. I don't think anyone is ever gonna top that Gambit. He was okay in this film, but it could have been much better. No complaints about the lead characters though. I already mentioned William Stryker and Wolverine, but Liev Schreiber (Sabretooth) plays his character very well. You can almost feel the anger and somewhat sadistic aura whenever he shows himself on the screen. A job well done, Liev.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I found this movie entertaining. It could have been better at some points, but it's not horribly mutilated as I first thought it would be. <br/><br/>One last warning for fan girls of Hugh Jackman... There's like 5 minutes in the movie where he is completely naked..."

","What amazes about that boy Wolverine is that over a century of storied adventures, traveling the world, fighting numerous battles, through changing trends and technological advances, he manages to keep that same funky Astro Boy hairstyle.<br/><br/>I've lost track of all the ""authorized"" Marvel Comics origin tales and ""official"" time lines of Wolverine/Logan, although I remember enough to know X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is a consolidation of many strands of the Logan mythos into a cogent origin tale that will itself stand as an ""authorized"" version to many.<br/><br/>Written by David Benioff and Skip Woods, directed by Gavin Hood (RENDITION, 2007), WOLVERINE is glaringly designed to be Hollywood glossy, studio extravagant and popcorn maximus. Despite all this, it's a pretty good actioner that won't offend too much - unless you're a fan boy.<br/><br/>The Logan from the graphic novels broods darkly over his hunted existence, assassin status and homicidal urges. Unlike Peter Parker and Clark Kent, the Canadian mutant with the caress of steel is, like his animal counterpart, constantly subsuming his berserker blood-lust and paying for it psychologically. His complicated loves and losses are tragic in ways that a PG-13 actioner could never define. WOLVERINE might have been one of the great superhero movies had it steered into the curve like WATCHMEN and created a gritty R-rated closeup of a tormented soul. Instead, we get muttonchops saut√©ed in popcorn.<br/><br/>Aussie Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, his fourth film as this character, still proving himself one of the best casting choices ever made in cinematic history, with his - ahem - razor wit, altar boy charm, brooding superhero irony and playgirl muscles. Oh, dem muscles! Movie follows Wolverine aka James Logan from his youth, when he first discovers bone claws housed in his forearms, through adulthood, fighting in world wars, civil wars, and eventually cajoled into a cadre of mercenaries led by William Stryker (Danny Huston).<br/><br/>Through it all, by his side, his half-brother, Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), also a mutant, with ripper nails and fangs instead of claws (who would later become the villain Sabretooth - but that's another x-tale).<br/><br/>The opening montage is a movie unto itself - the brothers battling through many eras in world history, each segment filmed in the style of the iconic film that represented that era - at Normandy, the visuals copycatting SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; in Viet Nam, APOCALYPSE NOW. This movie is so big and muscular - like our favorite berserker - we just hang on and hope someone has greased the axles and maintained the transmission while our hearts pump diesel.<br/><br/>Stryker's Death Squad features Ryan Reynolds as the katana-wielding Wade Wilson, who can slice an oncoming bullet in two; Will i Am is Wraith the teleporter; Dominic Monaghan is Bolt, handy to have around during a power outage; Kevin Durand is Fred Dukes, who would later become The Blob; Daniel Henney is sharpshooter Zero. Victor loves the ferocious camaraderie in this band of mutant brothers, but unethical missions leave Logan disenchanted and he walks away from this Death Squad, taking his muscles with him.<br/><br/>He and his muscles settle into idyllic life in the Canadian Rockies with a girlfriend - no, not Michiko, fan boys - Kayla (Lynn Collins), until crazy-eyed Victor comes gunning for him. Or should that be clawing? <br/><br/>Logan and Victor never age or get killed over all those wars. It is artfully conveyed that their mutant ability is superhuman regeneration of their body's cells. So even before he was imbued with the indestructible metal adamantium, Logan was pretty indestructible.<br/><br/>And Hugh Jackman looks it, using every opportunity to get down to that tank top and tight jeans. Who can blame the boy if he's worked that hard to get that hard? Back in the 50s and 60s, Superman and Batman movies featured skinny actors in padded suits. Who could have envisioned that in 2009 there would be an actor - not a ""weightlifter"" or ""bodybuilder"" - who could embody the physique that those weaklings aspired to? <br/><br/>And when he comes roaring naked out of that water tank, roped forearms blazing akimbo, adamantium claws snikting in fury, veins bursting through biceps, ferocious torso aglaze with electric runoff... you know every woman in her seat is as wet as he is.<br/><br/>That's what it takes to get infused with adamantium - a Playgirl pose-down. And he becomes a true super man. And probably the only comic book hero who never gets into costume, and who fans accept that way.<br/><br/>""'Cause I'm the best there is at what I do and what I do isn't very nice."" Through double-crosses and betrayals, Logan's purpose eventually solidifies as revenge on Victor and Stryker.<br/><br/>Only in this fourth X-MEN movie do we feel the full lethality of Logan's claws, as he slices through everything in his path, from steel walkways to vault doors and Humvees, through cages, choppers and even the bathroom sink! Those claws, as well as all the other mutants' super powers, are utilized intelligently and often. There are never any moments where we roll our eyes because a character is not using their powers effectively - like in all the other X-MEN movies.<br/><br/>We meet Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), and a young Cyclops (Tim Pocock), who, like his older counterpart James Marsden, graduated from Teen Model Mannequin University. And Patrick Stewart is a young Professor Xavier, airbrushed like a Playboy Bunny.<br/><br/>As a prequel, WOLVERINE acquits itself nicely, answering questions on how Logan acquires his adamantium, interacts with young Stryker; how he loses his memory and how he becomes too sexy for a spandex costume.<br/><br/>But it still doesn't tell us how he got that funky Astro Boy hairdo.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."
"TheEtherWalk","1","58","100","2 May 2009"," Epic Fail: the Movie
","Where to begin with this one. Problems are numerous, including spotty acting, effects, and cinematography. I'm going to focus on the script for this review as it really looks like the writers wrote up a bunch of plot points, characters and trailer-ready fight sequences, and then tried to write a movie around them. The result is nothing short of disastrous.<br/><br/>For a movie that is supposed to give the origins of Wolverine, they did a good job of telling us exactly nothing about WHO Wolverine is. It's like they assume we know everything about the characters already, so there's no need to develop anyone's character. A movie should stand on its own. Origins: Wolverine is a one-legged dog.<br/><br/>Liev Schreiber and Hugh Jackman both do well in their roles, but the first 10 minutes of the movie are rushed and underdeveloped. It's too fast-paced, and the result is painfully uninvolving. They spend about 3 minutes as kids, in which we find out practically nothing about them. Then it literally cuts from them being kids running through the woods to them shooting people in the Civil War. The opening credits montage takes us through 150 years in about 3 minutes, and suggests that Logan is tired of being in wars and Victor loves it. This is all the information we get about who they are. By the time they're recruited by Stryker, they have interacted with each other approximately twice. Why do they join every single American war? Do they just like getting shot a lot? Why is Victor so bloodthirsty and Logan good? How did Logan and Kayla meet? How did Logan find out he was invincible? Does he feel anything about the fact that he killed his father? The filmmakers didn't care. This movie has all the depth of a piece of cardboard.<br/><br/>Victor's motivations are beyond murky throughout the whole film. He basically goes around killing characters for no real reason at all. Logan's relationship with his girlfriend starts out very poorly developed and actually becomes LESS believable by the end of the movie. In the one scene that is supposed to develop Logan and Kayla's relationship, she starts talking about some weird symbolic moon myths... its unintentionally hilarious. Oh, and it turns out she's a mutant and is hypnotizing Logan in order to watch him for Stryker, and fakes her death in order to make Logan to want revenge on Victor to force him into the Weapon X program so they could test the adamantium on him for the Deadpool project and then erase his memory in order to rescue her sister from Stryker. Seriously. But she really loves him! Uh-huh. They conveniently leave out how Logan and Kayla met, which at first seems like just lousy character development, but then you realizethat they skipped over this so that they wouldn't have to explain the exact circumstances of their meeting with her secretly spying on him. I suppose it was just too darn hard to for these guys to write. Lynn Collins is completely wooden, and I didn't care one iota for her character.<br/><br/>The lack of any believable characters leaves the movie plot-driven. But there's so many holes in the story that it's not even worth trying to find them all. This movie is basically a series of scenes, with very little connecting each one except Hugh Jackman's best efforts. Wolverine gets his jacket. Check. Wolverine gets his dog-tags. Check. Wolverines bone spikes somehow become giant knives when he gets his adamantium. The plot is not only convoluted and full of holes, but it completely negates itself in the last 10 minutes. Since Kayla ends up being alive, any tension created by the revenge scenario is totally wasted, and suddenly Victor is a good guy!? Everything was apparently done to create the super-mutant Deadpool (who doesn't have one single element of the comics Deadpool, except the name) who lasts about 10 minutes before dying by Logan's claws. That's the plot. Even though I know hardly anything about the comics, this is awful storytelling.<br/><br/>All of Stryker's team are pointless, Dominic Monaghan is totally wasted, Ryan Reynolds disappears after the first 10 minutes and never returns, and the team's individual powers are never explained at all. Kevin Durand can put his fist in a tank's main gun and stop a shell, and then he becomes grotesquely fat. Will I Am (what kind of name is this?), whose character is apparently named Wraith, is basically a rip-off of Nightcrawler. Gambit is just in this for the fanboys and doesn't even have the right accent. There's a guy who can do gun-kata. Wow, I didn't know shooting people like the guy in Equilibrium was a mutant ability! Cyclops shows up for very little reason but to give Deadpool cool eye beams. All of these characters are mere plot points, moving Logan from place to place and then dying or disappearing. It would be predictable if it weren't so unbelievably bad.<br/><br/>And the fights? Most are pretty short, inconsequential and bloodless. That's right, the savage Wolverine hardly doles out any real violence, only to his brother and to Deadpool, and since both have regeneration, and we know Victor and Logan will live, even the stabs have no stab. The cinematography and editing are pretty lousy. Remember the fight between Logan and Sabretooth from the first movie, on top of the Statue of Liberty? Or the White House attack with Nightcrawler from the second? There's no great techniques like those here, most of it is flat green-screening or total CGI shots. Some of the sets looks pretty cheap. Even the teleportation effects got worse in this one. The CGI is passable but not very realistic. All in all decidedly average visuals.<br/><br/>What's left at the end of all this is a movie with hardly any drive, substance or value. I'm disappointed that this was the best they could do with such great potential."
"Joejoesan","8","265","505","28 April 2009"," Far better than I expected
","To tell you the truth I'm pretty surprised by all the negative reviews I've been reading on the IMDb and elsewhere on the net (AICN for example). I thought X-Men 1 and 2 came close to being masterpieces and that X-Men 3 sucked big time. The Wolverine movie however is well made, exciting and surprisingly effective. But that's an opinion from somebody who doesn't know anything about the comics. To me Wolverine is mainly a movie hero and maybe that can make a big difference. <br/><br/>Two elements make this movie really work. Liev Schreiber - a very underestimated actor - does a great job as Wolverine's brother Victor/Sabretooth. It's their love/hate relationship that is the main subject in this story and that really keeps it interesting. In the first minutes of the movie this is well established. The opening credits are really beautiful.<br/><br/>Second: the story. I really love the story. It has romance, betrayal, vengeance, action, a touch of immortality... All the good elements are there in the right doses.<br/><br/>Yes, I really love this movie. I hope to see more of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the future, because there are a lot more adventures he can and should have. Maybe director Gavin Hood can repair some of the damage that Brett Ratner did with a X-Men 3. Because an X-Men 4 - with hopefully Josh Halloway as Gambit - would be a great spectacle indeed. <br/><br/>There's only one big thing that really puzzled me. So the Liev Schreiber character is actually the same Sabretooth we see in X-Men 1? Because the two characters really don't seem the same in the two movies. Everything they have ""experienced together in the past"" (in the prequel) seems forgotten in X-Men 1 (when they only fight each other).<br/><br/>Anyway, go see this!<br/><br/>8,5 / 10"
"hwaite","3","162","302","17 April 2009"," plot driven exercise in stupidity
","Soulless milking of cash cow franchise. Generic superhero flick. CGI showcase. Gavin Hood's ""A Series of Improbable Events."" Combinatoric iteration of mutant fight scenes strung together by inane exposition justifying formation/dissolution of arbitrary alliances. I'm not expecting Shakespeare here but the clich√© per minute meter was off the charts: Primal scream while looking skyward and kneeling over murdered girlfriend. Renegade military commander. Predictable double crosses. Revenge sought for slain lover. Erased memories. Evil character discovering morality at last minute. Misguided failures to execute nemeses after defeating them in melee. Lover not really dead. Lover actually acting as spy for hero's arch-nemesis. Girlfriend/spy actually falls for protagonist. Good people work for antagonist in order to save kidnapped family members. Evil mastermind fails to honor promises to reluctant employees. Kindly old couple care for weary hero and get murdered for their troubles. Certain deaths averted as third parties arrive on scene before coup de grace. Hero reluctantly joining secret government agency. Abandonment of elite squad in protest over slaughter of innocents. Scientists unable to control indestructible killing machine of their own creation. Outdated but lovable government 'secret weapon' kills off better designed but heartless successor. Hero strolls away from wreck and casually lights a trail of gasoline behind him. After everyone has given up, flatlined heart monitor picks up a pulse. Evil mastermind explains plans to hero he no longer sees as a threat. Hero refuses to kill defeated foe because he's ""better than that"". Transparent comic relief character makes hilarious understatements and offbeat comments. Cheerful psychopath revels in random murderous rampages. Nigh indestructible Goliaths hurl one another through a series of walls and other physical traumas that would kill a mere mortal. Man dispatches dozens of gun wielding enemies with nothing but skillful swordplay. Common sense and the laws of physics, biology and chemistry temporarily abandoned. Antagonist using loved one's murder as justification for misguided crusade.<br/><br/>I could go on but this is just exhausting. If you're over the age of twelve and not living in mom's basement, there's probably nothing here for you. Depressingly enough, it's not too far off of par for superhero movies so discount all I've written if you can't get enough of the genre."
"Krazyzark","2","322","623","3 May 2009"," Underdeveloped and Overproduced
","This film was slated to be a blockbuster film, and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie delivers, perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man, but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects, the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote.<br/><br/>Many viewers, myself included, will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered, but that only makes the film a poor adaptation, not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30-minutes, as is Sabertooth, though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film.<br/><br/>The ""final boss"" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character.<br/><br/>Very disappointing..."
"aatifshah","10","35","59","18 May 2009"," I liked the pace of this movie - Jackman rocks as always
","In my view this was one of the Best X-Men Movies if not the best. The starts with a Bang ... one of the best starts with great background music to complement the starting sequence. Overall all the character in this movie are well composed. I like the way Victor was put together in this movie. he really put up a strong show. Rest all other X-Men did well but were overshadowed by Wolverine and Victor but that what the movie was all about ... the origion of wolverine. I m a Big fan of Jackman. He really deliver his best. Movies like X-Men and Ven Helsing are type of movies that show his true character. A must watch film. forget about people who say this movie is a flop. Just go and watch it. You won't be disappointed. I can bet."
"Nev_VG","10","39","67","1 May 2009"," Much better than most say.
","There seems to be a lot of negative, critical comments on the boards and in the comments here on IMDb, but I beg to disagree.<br/><br/>Though this movie wasn't perfect, and surely could have been better, I found that it was a great watch, and worth the 12.50 I paid for my ticket.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackmans performance of Wolverine was as always, outstanding. As a huge comic-fan/reader, I feel he never fails at portraying one of my favorite characters. Leiv Schreiber as Sabretooth was much better then I'd ever expected. I had my doubts about him playing Sabretooth, and I didn't like how human he looked(as opposed to the Sabretooth appearance in X1). But his excellent portrayal of the character definitely countered the looks for me. I wouldn't change anything about Leiv's performance.<br/><br/>As for Deadpool/Wade, I understand some peoples dislike for how he was different from the comics. But even with these changes, Deadpool was still an amazing character, well-done by Ryan Reynolds. The secret ending with him(Shhh!) makes me very excited, because if Reynolds plays Deadpool in a spin-off of the movie, I'll be very eager to watch.<br/><br/>Finally, Gambit. Gambit has always been my favorite x-men, so I had extremely high expectations of the character. This being said, I found Kitsch did very well with Gambit, the only problems I had with the character were his accent, and his lack of screen time. Though his accent wasn't horrible, it definitely wasn't cajun.<br/><br/>I'll admit, the storyline jumps around, and there are some minor plot holes. But a major thing to have in mind when watching this movie, is to just think of it as a MOVIE. Some changes were made from the comics, and some characters may not be what you expected. But if you go into this movie strictly looking at it as entertainment and a good summer movie, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Even myself as a major x-men fan, I was not disappointed. Overall, this movie lived up to my expectations, and in my opinion, it doesn't deserve the negative comments being made about it.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend it to everyone."

","To tell you the truth, i never expected this movie to take me to that point.I felt like I was 13 again. it was excellent. By far this is the best X men movie made, that brought out the real Marvel X men experience which i loved. Obviously from the first X men movie it self we knew that Hugh Jackman was the perfect Wolverine, and he has turned out to e a legend. i don't think anybody else in this world could bring out the animal and portrait Logans sensitive side both at the same time. It was brilliant. And it would be a crime if i don't mention the spectacular performance by Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth AKA Victor Creed. My god he was the Villain of the story, but his reflection of sabertooth made all X men fans to fall in love with him. I fell in love with that character. it was like the true cartoon sabertooth from the 1980's was brought to life. I hated the sabertooth that was in X Men 1. it was like a bad soft toy. Finally what made this movie the best X men movie is not the graphics or the effects, or sound, It was the Strong Story which happen to be the true story of Wolverine. Don't get me wrong though the graphics effects, sounds were excellent. Then as every Critic i have a few Criticism's as well. The main thing what i don't like in this move is what they did to dead pool at the end. That never happened!! they made that awesome mutant a freak!! I loved his performance (could've done better) and i love that Character Dead Pool. They could've used him Differently. Having said That overall it was a brilliant movie. All true Old marvel comic X men lovers would worship this movie. I can't wait till they create the next movie and i really really love to see my all time favorite one of the most powerful Mutants, APOCALYPSE!!!! in it... One Last thing; Only a true old X men lover could get the fullest impact on this great movie or should i call it the great piece of ART done by Gavin Hood, David Benioff, Skip Woods And Hugh Jackman?"
"jon.h.ochiai","9","40","71","4 May 2009"," Surprising ""Wolverine""
","Hugh Jackman is powerful in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". ""Wolverine"" is the fourth ""X-Men"" movie. Jackman as ""Wolverine"" may have made the transition to crossover box office movie star. ""Wolverine"" works as the modern telling of the classic hero story with Jackman as the tragic hero Logan/Wolverine. In the scene of ultimate betrayal, Logan regrets, ""I ignored my instincts. I ignored who I am. I won't ever let that happen again¬Ö"" For a visually stunning action tale ""Wolverine"" has surprising pathos. Director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"") and writers David Benioff (""Troy"") and Skip Woods convey a mesmerizing and compelling story for the first hour. I think the ""Wolverine"" narrative falters a bit at the last 10 minutes, because of the comic book mythology constraint. However, in retrospect this is actually fine.<br/><br/>Despite this, ""Wolverine"" evokes a visceral vengeance tale in the fierce conflict between Logan (Jackman) and his deadly rival Victor Creed (commanding Liev Schreiber), Logan's half-brother. Under the direction of Hood, their battles are bloody and full of rage. At a story arc during a vicious claw wielding struggle Creed commands Logan, ""Do it!"" The hero Logan must choose his fate.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, already anointed ""Sexiest Man Alive 2008"", looks incredible, his body is totally shredded. More impressive than his physicality, Jackman awes in his riveting performance as Logan, a man who suffers great tragedy and consumed by tremendous rage. Jackman never tames the animal in Logan, but he manages to humanize him with honor and compassion.<br/><br/>""Wolverine"" tells the back story of the most captivating character of the ""X-Men"" mythology. Logan is a mutant with unheard of regenerative and healing powers, which makes him virtually ageless. He possesses great strength, animal-like reflexes and senses, and claws that retract from his hands. Logan is a killing machine without equal.<br/><br/>We learn that Jimmy (Logan) and his half brother Victor are forced to leave their home in 1845 following a family tragedy surrounding Jimmy's discovery of his mutant powers. Logan and Victor fight in the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Vietnam War. Recognizing their deadly gifts shadowy William Stryker (deceptively evil Danny Huston) asks Logan and Victor to join his ""special team"". Members include other powerful mutants like Wade Wilson (charming and charismatic Ryan Reynolds) who can split bullets with a katana, and strongman Dukes (good Kevin Durand). During a ruthless mission in Africa, Logan realizes what he may become as he witnesses Victor's fall into the dark abyss. Logan declares, ""I'm done!"" <br/><br/>Logan finds peace in Canada with the love of his life Kayla (stunningly beautiful and strong Lynn Collins). However, the world can not let Logan be. Col. Stryker and Agent Zero (silently charismatic Daniel Henny) track Logan down. Apparently, someone is brutally killing members of his former team. Grave tragedy soon befalls Logan, and he is consumed by vengeance, ""I'm coming for blood, no code of conduct, no law!"" Stryker obliges, ""You will have your revenge."" Logan agrees to become the virtually indestructible Weapon X having Adamantium fused to his skeleton. Discerning certain betrayal by Stryker, Logan now wielding Adamantium claws goes rogue in an electrifying display of berserk rage. However, Logan soon unveils the depth of his betrayal.<br/><br/>Writers Benioff and Woods introduce perhaps one too many mutants. Although, some of the characters are engaging, like ally Gambit (strong wise guy Taylor Kitsch). Perhaps, the story's profound strength is Lynn Collins's Kayla. Here Benioff and Woods amaze as Kayla tells Logan the Indian legend of the Moon and the Wolverine. Jackman and Collins have a touching chemistry. We truly believe that Kayla's love calms the beast in Logan. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has great story telling and heart pounding action throughout the first half. I think Hood kind of rushes his narrative toward the end which may be more an artifact of the comic book mythology. In the end ""Wolverine"" satisfies as the classic hero story, and Hugh Jackman compels as the story's awesome hero."

Without giving away anything, I thought this movie was an excellent addition to the X-men saga and fit perfectly with what they were trying to do in the first 3 movies. Yes, it is centered around Wolverine and his ""origins"", but they do give some screen time to other mutants (some we know, some we don't).<br/><br/>We get a lot of information about Wolverine, his past, and how he ended up in the condition in which we find him in X-Men.

","A true story.<br/><br/>The year is 2015 and one of the local movie channels recently ran this film.<br/><br/>So I watched, thinking this must be one of the series films that I missed...? And I watched and I watched and I watched.<br/><br/>And by the very last scene, when Wolverine walks off into the sunset (literally) I realized that I had in fact seen this when it first came out and EXACTLY like Jackman's character in this wretched film, I had suppressed the memory because the experience was so traumatic.<br/><br/>How bad is this film? Well if you are teaching a film class you could use it as a clinic for how NOT to write a script.<br/><br/>With the sole exception of an ""action"" scene about 45 mins in -- where the Wolverine gets serious about mayhem and the viewer is caught up in the contagion of the moment -- this is a film that starts weak and just gets weaker.<br/><br/>There is no character to identify with. There is no one you would want to have a drink with when the film is over. There is no audience connection. There are no triumphs, only progressive losses.<br/><br/>I am going to end the review here and try to forget the film ... again. If you have not seen it, as your faithful scribe, I suggest you watch X-Men I instead. It is not merely better. It is 100X better."

It is action packed and the story line is superb, I was glued to the TV without wanting even to look away for a moment scared id miss something.

","I read some of the reviews made by fans of the comic book complaining about the perversion of Wolverine's story line prior to his loss of memory. They are probably right to be disappointed. I my self do not have enough background knowledge of the characters from the comic books and as others have pointed out, due to these circumstances this movie appeals to audiences that are not acquainted with the source material. And boy does it appeal. <br/><br/>The story line is energetic, full with action scenes worthy of an X-men prequel. But as I mention in the title it is also a heartbreaking love story (apart from one or two clich√©s) it does make it worth your while if you can make it past all the twists and turns.<br/><br/>I give it a 9 only because of what happens to Ryan Reynolds character. It's a real shame not to be able to see more of his witty remarks, when you see the movie you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>So all in all I my self, walked away a satisfied man from the theater tonight and I encourage you to give it a try and watch it. And, oh yeah, apart from some other opinions here, Hugh Jackman is extraordinary as Wolverine once again, as well as heartbreaking."
"xfromanywhere","3","79","157","29 April 2009"," What happened, this was suppose to be awesome and it's just ...not.
","This film just feels like the studio threw it together quickly to try and appease the fans. As a fan of all things Marvel I have to say, this attitude to just rushing a film to screen and throwing in a few fan favourites is simply not good enough. Basically what should have been a deep story about a man struggling to control the animal within turned into a series of fight sequences punctuated by a bit of exposition here and there to say who Wolverine is fighting and it's supposed to be cool because they are loved characters from the comics, but when you give said beloved character (Such as Gambit) all of ten seconds of back story and about five or six actual lines it tends to annoy fans more than placate them (This goes for Deadpool as well). When I was eight or nine a friend lent me street fighter 2 on the snes, just the cartridge so no box or instruction booklet, I played through it and it was fun, I taught myself all the cool moves and tried to open up all the characters. This film is a little like that game except you don't have the controller the game just plays itself - what's the point. X-men Origins: Magneto better be awesome because this film is seriously lacking in quality.<br/><br/>P.S. Gambit's southern accent should be stronger - even though he hardly has any thing to say with it.<br/><br/>Liev Schreiber was great as Sabretooth<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine - even though he didn't have a lot to work with, with this poor script. <br/><br/>Deadpool is seriously awesome but again should have had more screen time than the three minutes he was given. <br/><br/>BRING BACK BRYAN SINGER!!! or at least someone who actually cares about the comics."

","I was worried when i heard that they were making this movie. A prequel to a series that i liked a lot. I wasn't worried so much about Hugh Jackman as i was worried about the rest of the cast. After watching it i came out with mixed feelings. The Action and special effects, were awesome and Hugh Jackman was funny and cool. But the overall acting in the film was very average. The beginning of the movie felt very rushed, it seemed they wanted to get to the middle very quickly. The middle of the movie was cool but somewhat confusing if you arnt Knowledgebale about X-Men. The ending was the best part, i don't want to give anything away but there is a pretty epic battle at the end. And the ending bridges this movie with the others quite well.

All I ask for in an action movie is a story that I can understand even if it maybe a bit exaggerated and good action. X-Men Origins delivers on both accounts, the movie sticks to what it says, Origins. The action was fast paced and exhilarating. The story moved, and was told with, I believe, basic simplicity. All of the reviews of this movie by our so called movie critics, and by the way who elected these people as representatives to the movie community, I don't remember casting a vote or seeing any campaign material, but I digress.

"XweAponX","10","39","73","4 May 2009"," Best of the X
","""I'm the best at what I do and what I do ain't pretty"" This film surprisingly stays fairly true to what we know about Wolverine and the ""Weapon X"" program through the comic books. The film is largely based in Barry Windsor-Smythe's ""weAponX"" which was run as a serial in the ""Marvel Comics Presents"" comic book line and later released in Trade Paperback form.<br/><br/>There is a lot here for fans of Wolverine, certain aspects of this story were taken right from the Wolverine series of 1988 - Wolverine's relationship with ""Silver Fox"" uses a lot of elements straight from the books and that ""chapter"" of the wolverine story is actually fairly close to the source material. The only dramatic license I did not like was that Sabretooth and Wolverine are shown as brothers.<br/><br/>Since the weAponX story by BWS was drawn in a cinematic style, a lot of the imagery from that book survives translation to Film format just as well as any Frank Miller book.<br/><br/>While a lot of creative license was taken with some characters and some of the events that occur, much of the dialogue is taken straight from the books and the overall concept is maintained.<br/><br/>Regarding the look of the film, I can use one example, when ""Gambit"" reveals his powers, the image we are given matches the iconic profile of Gambit- From the comic books and the 1992-96 Cartoon.<br/><br/>Since ""Victor Creed/Sabretooth"" was a major part of this film, I was semi-disappointed that they did not get Tyler Mane to reprise his earlier 2000 role (Or, pre-prise, whatever the word would be) - The original X-Men film had perfectly cast Sabretooth. I wish they had cast Liev Schreiber for that original film, as he gives more to the character than occasional grunts and snarls that Tyler Mane used for language. Schreiber actually gives the character valid depth and darkness and is less of a cardboard cutout. My only real gripe about using a new actor for this role is that they did not try to match the image from the books, as the 2000 film did perfectly. And so the popular image of Wolverine engaged in mortal combat with Sabretooth- As painted by former Wolverine artist Mark Texiera and reproduced as a huge poster - That image was damaged and I do not know if other Wolverine fans are a forgiving as I am.<br/><br/>Regardless of if the reason ""James Logan"" becomes part of the Weapon X program is the same reason as the comic books (In The comic books Logan is abducted) - The Process of Wolverine accepting the ""Adamantium"" metal to his bones is the centerpiece of this film, it is the most important part of the film, and as far as I am concerned you can toss the whole film and leave the process.<br/><br/>The filmmaker needed to take the threads that had been woven in the first 3 X-Men films and give us a start point... Where did the Adamantium metal come from, what Stryker wanted to do with it, and why, all of these questions are explored in this film and as a fan of the comic book series, and also a fan of films in general, I accept the questions, answers and the way it was filmed unequivocally.<br/><br/>I know I enjoyed this film highly, and so did the large amount of people I saw this with, this film got a lot of crown response.<br/><br/>And so, I say the critics and paid shills that are panning this film can go to blazes and I hope that someone does to them what Wolverine does to ""Deadpool/Wade Wilson"" at the end of the film - And you'll have to go see it to find out what he does. Oh, look the shills popped up and marked my post as ""not helpful"" - Which means nothing except that someone is using a bunch of fake IDs"
"MartinHafer","4","6","8","28 July 2011"," The writers obviously had little respect for the fans....
","This film is a prequel‚Äîabout the origins of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). It follows Wolverine and his brother, Sabretooth, from their carefree days fighting in various wars (Civil, WWI and II and Vietnam), to personality changes in Sabretooth (turning him into a sociopath) to the ultimate operation that gave Wolverine his Adamantium skeleton.<br/><br/>As a prequel it stinks because it honestly looks as if the writers didn't even bother to watch the earlier films. So, when time and time again the story completely contradicts the previous movies, I couldn't help but be annoyed. Who cares if Wade/Deadpool is little like his character‚Äîlet's give his Cyclops' eyes! Who cares that several characters were much younger and appeared as teenagers in the first X-Man movie‚Äîlet's have them be adults in this film that takes place BEFORE the first movie! Who cares that Stryker is not punished at all after he does innumerable atrocities‚Äîand the good guys had a chance to finally settle to score! Who cares that the dialog is god-awful and the characters take turns spouting nothing but macho clich√©s?! And, most importantly, who cares that unlike the other X-Man movies, this one is not the least bit fun or enjoyable! This is a very easy film to skip, as it just doesn't fit into the X-Man world and shows that given a great idea and excellent source material, bad writing and an over-reliance on action (and ignoring dialog and the idea of depth to characters) will spoil the film. Not horrible¬Öbut not at all good. As prequels go, I'd recommend ""X-Man: First Class""."

","What do you get when you take unimaginative storytelling, overdone special effects, and yawn-able fight scenes? <br/><br/>It is not hyperbole to call X-Men Origins: Wolverine the worst superhero movie ever made. Worst than Batman and Robin. Worst than Daredevil. I hated every single soul sucking, vacant, boring, trite, overplayed, clich√© minute of this movie. I could not find one redeemable minute is the entire Hollywood mangling of what could have been a decently entertaining movie. <br/><br/>In sum, X-Men Origins Wolverine involves an unmotivated cast of characters defined by their powers and not their absent personalities. Some reviewers have highlighted Ryan Reynolds's performance as being notable. Well it is, because Reynolds overacts well beyond his supporting cast as wise-cracking cardboard cutout. Unfortunately even Hugh Jackman looks bored as Wolverine, and his performance is the least interesting rendition of Wolverine seen thus far. <br/><br/>If you want a superhero movie involving paint by the number fight scenes, fake looking cgi, a predictable and boring romance, and a climax that will leave you wanting to turn the movie off, I would recommend X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I will warn you though, it is not ""so bad its good"" its just so horribly below par it will leave you unsatisfied and wanting your time back even more than your money. <br/><br/>Not a single redeemable moment in the entire movie."

","In the Northwest Territories of Canada in 1845, Victor is watching over his friend James. His father is heard being shot and James runs down to find him dead. He then attacks the man who shot him with bones that come out from his hands putting them into the man's chest killing him as he tells him that he is his son. After doing so James flees the house Victor close behind him finally catches him. Victor tells James do you realize we are brothers now; we need to stick together no matter what and take care of anyone who gets in our way. <br/><br/>There are flashes of the brothers Victor and James going through every major war and never stopping to look to the past. It gets to be too much and Victor ends up killing a Sr. officer and they both end up undergoing a firing squad. Striker opens their cell and tells them if they want to join a special team with special privileges they can join or either stay here and rot. They join the team and their mission is to get a rock that is from outer space which they yet don't know that. After they have gotten the rock from a heavily guarded building with diamonds they head to an African village to try and get answers where the rock came from. The villager said it came from the sky and not believing them, the villagers begin to run and people almost get killed including Victor almost killing the guy. <br/><br/>James tells Victor to stop because he did not sign up for this and does not want to be a part of this team anymore and leaves with Victor yelling his name. Six years later Striker finds Logan working at a logging mill telling him that someone has killed Wade and Bradley not to long after that from the old team. Not wanting anything to do with it, he just says he wants nothing to do with it anymore. Logan tells his girlfriend about Striker showing up. The next day he smells a scent of Victor and finds his girlfriend dead close by her abandoned car. Tracking down Victor at a bar they battle it out and he tells Logan how else was I supposed to get your attention. Leaving Logan telling him he is more like him than he knows, he just doesn't know it yet. <br/><br/>Waking up at a hospital and finding Striker there who tells Logan that Victor went AWOL and is coming after everyone from the old team. Wanting revenge for what his brother has done, Striker injects Logan with Adamantium which is what he was looking for in Africa that day six years ago, which is a metal so strong that he will be able to withstand virtually anything. <br/><br/>Unlike the other X-men this one has a story although Last Stand did have somewhat of a story with Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto. Wolverine has some of the students from the other movies just starting to go to the school for the gifted for their powers, so I wonder if they will play off that a little more. This movie shows, how Logan/Wolverine has become what he is and how he lost his memory. The special effects in this movie are really amazing and also you get to see some characters which you probably have not seen in the other X-men movies. Even if you haven't seen the other X-men movies you don't have to because this one is about Logan/Wolverine which intrigues you more I think. I mean would you rather see the good guys fighting the bad guys with powers or have a story behind how each character grew and where they started out at? Even if you have never seen the other X-men movies I would highly recommend checking this one out before the others."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) This is the origins of the most popular mutant. Every one has a past. nobody can figure out Logan. Well, here we get answers, well.............some of em anyway.<br/><br/>Origins has the exploits of Logan from the early childhood to his supposed immortal life. No answers. We see montages of his later days. No answers. He and his brother, Victor throughout the years. Still no answers. Then Logan and Victor, join an elite squad of soldiers on top secret missions. By the way, not much answers here either. Notice a pattern? Origins is all about the clawed mutant and his past that we got curious about in the first two X-Men movies. Here, it is somewhat explained, but not really. He is with a group of soldiers, then they disband, no answers. We have a huge group of mutants, just forget about character development as there hardly ever looked upon, and shockingly not as much on Logan and hardly on his brother Victor, who by the way is ""Sabretooth"" who in the first X-Men movie did not even mention that Logan is his brother at all. There is even an appearance by a somewhat known mutant that was given as much screen time as Kurt Russel in ""Death Proof"". And character development? Forget it. Did I mention that I caught some plot holes that the filmmakers did not. It was easy as you probably did too. There are also some scenes here that can go from plain bad to unbelievably cheesy. I found myself rolling my eyes at some, and found myself laughing when I was not supposed to, and not laughing when I was supposed to. Ouch.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman has lost the passion and spark of Wolverine. He just does not have it in him anymore as was evident in the last X-Men movie. I noticed that Ryan Reynolds is here and gives a really bored performance as well. As a matter of fact, nobody here seemed to enjoy themselves. The action movie chiches' are far too much and this is not what we wanted.<br/><br/>Origins is supposed to give us answers, not leave us with questions. There are far too many questions to come across. This does not give as much of a deep insight into the clawed mutant that I originally thought. This is not like the first two X-Men movies, which were fun and exciting, this is like the awful third, uneven, unfocused, and unnecessary."

","Close to one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story is so rushed it leaves you asking questions of why? With more focus on the visuals the story seems very slap dash and they have managed to ruin probably one of the best comic book characters. They need to focus at least more on his back story and perhaps the relationship with mutant group established by Stryker. Also they touched upon other characters within the Weapon X Project and then quickly skipped over, as soon as they came in they quickly left (trying not to give anything away). The biggest disappointment, especially after so much hype. This could have been something great. Also with Magneto in the pipeline as well, could they ruin another part of the X-Men saga."

","What can I say? Another disappointing Hollywood movie; this has only reinforced the fact that Hollywood is all about the big bucks & exploiting anything & everything that already has an established fan base; dumbing it down because they believe it makes the film more appealing to wider audience (In their mind this means more $). Whats next? 'The Crow' vs 'Watchmen', 'The Matrix' vs 'Star Wars' vs 'Star Trek' ? ? ?<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing 'Wolverine'. I'll admit I was pumped; I wanted to learn more about the character (what makes him tick?) & where he came from. What happened? I get a 2hour CGI/FX sm√∂rg√•sbord, a predictable plot that goes nowhere, weaker than weak acting, a Deadpool fiasco & I learn't nothing that I didn't already know about Wolverine. What a disaster. The visuals are meant to be the icing on the cake; there is nothing holding this cake together. <br/><br/>Why couldn't I get a proper dark serious R rated 'Wolverine', low budget, gritty, sex & violence, real drama, real characters. True to the source material; Wolverine is a complex character & his origin isn't exactly 'Butterflies & Faires'. <br/><br/>Is Hollywood morbidly afraid to release a film that actually makes people think? A film that lets the audience use a bit of imagination to fill in the gaps & let them have their own interpretation, something that engages & stimulates them. Is it too much to ask for an interesting story & character development? All I know for sure is that I wont be seeing any new Marvel related films; I can make a better movie in my film class."

He was a good choice for the part and plays it well, it just sucks that it was in a movie with a script that destroys the original mythology of the characters.<br/><br/>Deadpool held my interest in this movie more than anything. He was played very well by Ryan Reynolds but was basically removed from the movie after the idiotic plot twist. Deadpool was suppose to get a spin off but now will not because he gets killed and because of the absolutely absurd transformation that was made to him. <br/><br/>And then there's the whole ""Let's shoot him with Metal (true name not allowed on this site for some reason) bullets in the head to erase his memory."" What a crock. They wouldn't have even done something this stupid in the comics. And in X-2, he got shot in the head in the same area. Wolverine is suppose to have 2 bullet holes in his head, those can't heal because of the Metal (true name not allowed on this site for some reason). He would have permanent indents in his forehead which were not shown in x-2 obviously, plus I am sure the bullets would have had to have passed straight through the skull with the high caliber of the gun that was used.<br/><br/>What are the chances that you would actually hit his memory center anyways? You could have ruined his motor functions or made him go completely beast like, made him go blind, etc... hence the movie is a screw up. F this movie. F fox. F the director.

Discovering this, Logan resigns and walks out on the gathered mutants. Fearing he might prove disloyal to their cause, Stryker ordered the rest of the team to seek out and destroy 'Wolverine' as he is now known. The entire film mutates into a battlefield of violent conflicts and cross purposes as former friends now become adversaries.

But i will not brag about how unfaithful, how disrespectful it was towards its root, because most of the people aren't fan's of the comic, and even aside this it is so much to criticize.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is terrible. Okay i know superheroes and villains aren't the most complicated roles ever. But i expect at least a little empathy, a little sign they care about their character or the script or anything.<br/><br/>The whole thing with the 2 old people was so out of the movie and out of reality for example. Yeah right if you are old, and you see a naked, confused, weird-looking guy in your property you will be best friends with him in 2 minutes, just to get shot in the head a day after it with no real reason, because the bad guys wasn't even after you anyway...Yeah sound so clever.<br/><br/>Not to mention this is one of those movies i thought they finished making in the 80's. You know in which the bad guys shooting out like 10 million bullets, but never hit the good guy, but the good guy kills everyone with one shot.... Watch out, even more cleverness.<br/><br/>But to top it. Remember the scene when Wolverine learns the truth about his beloved one? Well the bad guys tried to catch him in the whole movie. But when he stands there, and after he talks with the girl, he just walks away while the bad guys are watching him and letting him go. Off he goes broken hearted, he seems not to care anymore about the girl or anything. But oh noes the girl screams and he suddenly like ""oops i forget my car keys there"" or something because he goes back. Why? Why after he thinks he was played for a fool, and he is such a mean guy anyway and he walks away? Is everyone in this movie retarded? <br/><br/>Speaking about character development: Wolverine: I am mean-----I am meaner-----Who the f i am? <br/><br/>Sabertooth: Wolverine and i are the only ones for each other, we can count only on each other oh and of course i am mean-----Wolverine is not as mean as i am, he doesn't kill innocents, so i need to kill him, no matter we fight together and trust each other since 100 years or so.---Despite i wanted to kill him all the movie long we need to team up again and kill Deadpool. Why he helps Wolverine anyway? He is the self-centered bastard in the movie, why doesn't he just disappear?<br/><br/>Wolverine's love interest, Silverfox: An object to show that Wolverine is not so mean after all----typical damsel in distress, with save me written all over her face.<br/><br/>I don't even bother with the rest of the characters they are non-existent.<br/><br/>Cheesy dialogue, the worst special effects i saw in a blockbuster, hands down, and the bitter feeling after you watch it, you know, when you feel someone made big money with ripping off on someone elses creativeness and idea and work.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie unless you have masohistic tendencies."

","i loved this movie much. instantly is one of my favorites. i was very disappointed to here about the leak and i am ashamed to see that Hugh Jackman's fans would do this to him, he is a great actor and deserves better. all in all this movie had a few character flaws but was absolutely outstanding i loved it. the plot has a lot of pretty good twists and has a very good ending. The special effects are far and and away some of the best that i have ever seen in this kind of movie. This movie is a great no actually and amazing addition to the x-men franchise and i look forward to seeing Jackman reprises his role as wolverine hopefully at least one more time."
"NavyOrion","7","18","33","2 May 2009"," Better than I expected
","Disclosure: I am not an X-Men aficionado. I like the movies, but I do not follow the comics or other sources of canonical ""lore,"" so I don't have any preconceived notions about how a story should be treated. But I have enjoyed the movies (OK, not so much the third, but as a matter of film-making, not because I necessarily considered it blasphemy against something I hold dear.) <br/><br/>That said, I found this to be a fairly entertaining look at the origin of the most famous of the X-Men, Wolverine. The plot was a little thin, but did have enough sudden turns to hold your interest. Some nice set pieces showing him and his brother (well-played by Liev Schreiber) in various wars could have been a bit longer than the few seconds each got, but were adequate to demonstrate the growing tension between the two brothers as they matured over the course of 200 years. The long-awaited scene where he gets his adamantium skeleton was nicely done, but would have benefited from being a bit darker and more graphic.<br/><br/>The other mutants were a bit pointless, and at some points even comical (who'd have thought there would be a crossover to ""Fat Bastard"" of Austin Powers fame?) And the role of Gambit was completely pointless, unless he is, as I suspect, a larger character in the comic arena, and had been demanded by X-Men fans who missed him in the other three movies. But his character did nothing helpful that anyone else couldn't have done. Cyclops seemed to be there as nothing more than foreshadowing that he's getting the next ""origin"" movie.<br/><br/>If the movie had one weakness that stands out, it would be the CGI. Guys, we're a couple decades into this now; there's no excuse for the blades not looking real. It's silly to have cartoonish-looking blades, especially in the shots where they weren't seen protruding from Logan's hands, and real metal could have been used (the farmhouse bathroom, for example.) Another example of poor effects was Patrick Stewart's uncredited cameo as Dr. Xavier. Although I imagine people are more difficult than metal, his face was so airbrushed to make it younger (even worse than in X-3) that I really do not know if it was all CGI, or just a live shot with bad retouching work. No Oscar for you, guys! <br/><br/>All in all, though, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" will be an adequate beginning to the summer blockbuster popcorn movie season, and will do well enough until ""Star Trek"" launches next week."

","now i'm not really a fan of the other X-men films but i really liked this. especially love the first twenty minutes of it. it really sets a brilliant pace for the makings of a classic super hero movie. after that twenty minutes it goes a bit down hill. it does pick up at the end. the CGI is brilliant. the acting is OK too so i don't have anything bad to say on the actors performances. i was expecting a rubbish film but this did stun me.<br/><br/>the storyline is exactly what the title of the film refers too. its the origin and makings of Logan a.k.a Wolverine played by returning star Hugh Jackman. it basically shows him from an early age in the 1800's and through the starting credits you see him and his brother in wars that occur from the 1800's up in till today. brilliantly shot i think. Wolverines brother Victor brilliantly played by Liev Schreiber has the same abilities as him. both Wolverine and Victor join a small combat army of mutants. the leader of this team is Stryker played by Danny Huston and the team consist of actors Ryan Reynolds, Dominic Monaghan and believe it or not Will I Am from black eyed peas is in this too. he doesn't do a bad job. so this team go and kill people for Stryker but Wolverine isn't happy with doing evil deeds and walks away........... 6 years later and someones out there killing the mutants. Wolverine has been living the past 6 years quietly but unwillingly gets sucked into the battle.<br/><br/>this film is really good but it has some flaws such as........ it ends too quickly. the film goes at a fairly slow pace i think. the film should be more explanatory and shown more scenes with the other mutants. i know this film is mostly focused on Wolverine because its his story but i think the other mutants should be in it more. it really should of been on for around two and a half hours i think. that would of bumped my IMDb rating to 9. the other bad thing was the slight cheesiness of it, it wasn't that bad but could of easily been suppressed at post-production and edited it out. if that was taken care of this film would of got a perfect 10 from me. but sadly that isn't what happened.<br/><br/>this film should definitely be watched by fans of the other X-men movies and just movie goers that love a good action movie should see this too. its very good on a whole............. 7/10..............j.d Seaton"
"pinkliz41","1","41","86","18 April 2009"," Just a bad film in all areas.
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is your typical and generic Superhero movie that delves deeper into it's own troubles and mistakes as you watch further into the film. Jackman is not a convincing Wolverine, well at least for the majority of the film he isn't. Audiences are meant to feel for what he is going through e.t.c. But you won't get that feeling because no life or soul is put into the development of Wolverine.<br/><br/>The direction is shameful and definitely undesirable. The same shots are used over and over again to give the film a cynical and un-professional angst to it. Hood clearly doesn't give a toss about the film's morals and objectives for its audience but just wants action. Even these violent and stupid scenes don't have the emotionality devised in other such Superhero movies like Spiderman or Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Overall X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a stupid and rushed Superhero movie that has lost all control and emotion because of the director inconsiderate use of action over story."
"Matt_Layden","6","33","68","18 April 2009"," Better Than I Thought It Was Going To Be
","This is the origins story of the mutant known as Wolverine and how he was attached to the weapon x project.<br/><br/>When I first heard they were going to make this flick, I thought that the series was going to go into a nosedive. The third film in the X-men franchise lacked everything that made the first two films enjoyable. Now a spin-off? I wasn't having it and the fact that they seemed to ruin one of my favourite x-men characters in the trailers didn't seem to help either. Well, I can say this, the film is not that bad. It's actually decent and a step up from the horrid Last Stand. Although they do miss a few steps that really hurt the film as a whole.<br/><br/>First off Hugh Jackman was born to play this character, here he is given more room to dive deeper into the animal and he does a great job. Mixing both comedic and dramatic elements, there is nothing new here to the character, just more of the same. More of the same though is fun and kick ass. Liev Schreiber plays Victor Creed, aka Sabretooth. His look is different from the first time we see him and he actually has some speaking lines here. Excellent casting choice, Liev really lets go here and you can see the fun he is having with the character.<br/><br/>Now, onto the two things that are ruined, from a ""fan"" perspective. Deadpool and Gambit. Many fans knew going in that these two guys were both kick ass and that the film was not going to do them justice. Well, it's true. These two guys lacked the screen time and the badass personas that people have come to love. Ryan Reynold has 5 minutes of screen time, he does he usual jokey bits like in Blade Trinity, but here it fits for the character. We see one scene in which he uses his blades to deflect bullets, quite cool. Then he is gone for the rest of the film. Gambit shows up 3/4 of the way through and is horribly underused. Why is he in here again? His scenes lacked a lot of punch it seems that his character was only used to draw in fans. The character in the film could have been anybody else and it wouldn't effect the story, but they chose Gambit cause fans wanted to see him. You will be disappointed.<br/><br/>The final fight sequences is interesting, I don't want to go into details cause that would give away certain plot points, specifically who the final fight scene is with and why he is fighting him. I have to raise another complaint though, as for the explanation for Wolverine's so called memory loss. They don't explain it very well in the film, they just say that this will make him not remember. Why? I don't know. Fighting fire with fire just doesn't make sense to me. The explanation for his memory loss is truly pathetic and doesn't make any sense. <br/><br/>There are cameos from a lot of mutants, cyclops as a kid is one and another one at the end that fans will enjoy. I thought that they could have trimmed the running time down a bit, currently 1hr46min. Subplots don't really work in this film, I'm talking about his love interest. A lazy way to try and drive the plot forward.<br/><br/>The action sequences range from enjoyable to laughable. The opening credit sequences is neat and mirrors what Watchmen did.Fans will most likely be disappointed by the lack of respect this ""origin"" story deserved. It's leaps and bounds over the last film, but that's not really saying much. The special effects are the worst in the entire series, which is a huge let knock against it because it's almost ten years after the original."
"Bendy_Spoon_Productions","10","26","52","28 April 2009"," I had high expectations...And my god, were they fulfilled...
","I was lucky enough to have visited the set of Wolverine whilst it was in production. Believe me, I'll never forget the thrill of watching Logan elbow Gambit in the face in person, or myself shaking hands with Liev Schreiber...with his super-long fingernails on. Hell, I got to advise the editor, Nicholas De Toth, on which take should be used in the final cut. I consider myself super lucky, and admittedly might be a little biased towards the movie. But holy hell. I thought it would be incredible, but I wasn't prepared for the unstoppable onslaught of action my eyes beheld the night of the premiere.<br/><br/>To be fair, I wanted a little more Gambit and Deadpool. They're great characters (and Taylor Kitsch is a really cool guy), and they had the chance to use them a lot more. They didn't, but that's fine - Freddy Krueger was best in the first Nightmare, and he isn't around for much. It made me appreciate the screen time they had. Being a feature film, it's obvious that they can't explain, explore and probe every single moment in Wolverine's life as depicted in the comics, and some die-hard X-Men fans seem to think it's blasphemy to leave out a few details. Well, more than a few. But do you expect to see the tale of Wolverine told exactly the same as it was? I didn't. It's a movie, not a comic, another issue isn't going to be on newstands next week so the story can continue. They have to squish down to 2 hours or so, and with that, the screenwriters did really well.<br/><br/>In case I haven't said so, the action sequences totally blew my mind. Any person who has fantasies of running with a cool jacket on with explosions firing off everywhere, and you must to something super-cool and uber-dangerous to save yourself (I know I have) will find their dreams coming to life on the screen (the helicopter bit is the best example). True, a lot of CGI is used. I usually don't care for CGI, really. For example in Diary of the Dead. Decent movie, CGI was completely unnecessary. I was pining for Tom Savini to return. But in Wolverine's case, there's really no alternative. It fits. It works. It looks great.<br/><br/>All in all, a smashingly entertaining movie that's going to have a place in my collection as soon as a 2-Disc Edition hits the stores. Oh, and for the people who downloaded the unfinished work print...Why? Why would you do that, what is the bloody point? It was missing some special effects, a lot of the music... I didn't see this but I've been told that's how it was. I mean...I don't know what the hell was running through your mind. This is a movie that has to be seen on a big movie screen. And you ruined it for yourself. You may have saved your money but I assure you, you didn't gain anything."

","Watching Hugh Jackman play Wolverine again is like watching Anthony Hopkins play Hannibal again; no matter how bad the movie is, it's still great to watch them play their iconic, and #1 career roles. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' unfortunately starts off slow, and despite some good action sequences, really never picks up. The major problem with prequels is you already know what's going to happen, and in 'Wolverine' you hear him say I'm going to kill Sabretooth and Stryker probably a dozen times. Well, unless they're asking us to forget the original 'X-Men' films, it's kinda like someone saying in Star Wars 1-3: ""I'm going to kill Anakin"" or someone actually attempting the murder of the Anti-Christ in 'Left Behind.' And speaking of the original movies, didn't they already give the origins of Wolverine throughout all three films? At very least you learned a lot more about Hannibal Lector in 'Hannibal Rising,' though an equally bad film. In this one, you learn he's about 150 or more years old, he once was in love and his original claws were made of bone, which, by the way was hard to watch ‚Äì I wanted to see the steel ones throughout. That's about all the extras you'll get as you watch him grow & fight with or against his brother, Sabretooth, from the mid-1800s to present. And as mentioned, though some of the action sequences were well shot, a lot of the CGI, or effects were almost downright laughable. As was the unoriginal dialogue, the extremely predictable ""mystery"" (and I'm not referring to the fact it's a prequel; solving what this movie presents takes the mind of a four-year-old) and unnecessary and unoriginal origin story that's already been told. One word of advice, despite the ""shocking surprise"" after the credits, it's NOT WORTH IT."
"DareDevilKid","8","51","113","19 April 2009"," One Of The Few Genuinely Good Superhero Movies Which Aptly Translates The Comic Book!!
","I was fortunate to catch a special screening of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' a few days ago and I must admit that, it way exceeded my expectations. So much so, that I was stimulated into writing this review, something that I don't often practise.<br/><br/>First let me clarify that this isn't one of your run of the mill, blown-up SFX in your face, unrealistic action-oriented, plot less superhero movies that's thrashed out nowadays('Spiderman 2&3', 'Hulks', 'Fantastic Four 1&2', the intolerably over-hyped 'Ironman', and more...). It might be no 'Dark Knight' or 'Batman', but its definitely worth your movie ticket.<br/><br/>The movie begins just like the 'Wolverine Origins: Super Special' comic book - which I'm might proud to have in my possession - and Wolverine being one of my favourite superheroes since my teenage years, the initial sequences itself gladdened me immensely. From hereon, the movie just keeps escalating.<br/><br/>The script is spot-on, the narration flows smoothly, 'Gavin Hood's' direction without being brilliant, is noteworthy, and the action is mind-blowing with a rustic feel. The SFX might not be the best in recent years(which might be a blessing in disguise, considering some of the inane SFX extravaganzas released in recent years), though certain FX, animation and compositing amalgamations are still astounding. Fact in the matter being the climax, which rivets you to the edge of your seat and lingers in your mind for a considerable period.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, most of the cast turn in decent performances, especially 'Leiv Schrieber' as Sabertooth is exceptional, but its undoubtedly 'Hugh Jackman' who steals the show. This guy was just born to play Wolverine, its like he emerges from the comic book pages on to the big screen. Add to this, his superlative physique and fleeting nudity, and there's eye candy for the ladies too.<br/><br/>The X-men franchise without being the best around(Star Wars, Indiana Jones), has always strived for entertainment and sensibility simultaneously. This movie is no exception, with it being on par with the first of the series.<br/><br/>A great summer blockbuster after a long time.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10..........Go for it guys!!!"
"badmoonrison","4","19","37","3 May 2009"," Not good.
","I saw this movie with two friends the day it came out. We thought it would be packed, but to our surprise the theater only yielded about 50% of its capacity. Was this a sign of things to come?<br/><br/>The whole thing with the Civil War/WW1/WW2/Vietnam War was pretty cool... until I realized that Logan was Canadian and probably wouldn't have been involved in any of those conflicts. I became concerned almost immediately afterwards when I saw Logan, Victor, and their tight little ""squad"" running up on an African diamond king, and their Asian homie jumps over a fence, spins around like 30 times, shoots about 15 guards and lands like a Dragonball Z character. I then proceed to become VERY concerned when I see RYAN REYNOLDS (you know, the loser from Van Wilder) running around and deflecting... bullets... with his swords. WTF? I tried to stay positive, but so many things about this movie prompted laughter from our camp. <br/><br/>Possibly the most ridiculous scene was when Logan sparked his claws on the ground, started a perfect gasoline fire in a straight line that led to a crashed helicopter, and walked away somehow not noticing the massive explosion behind him. CORNY. There are countless action scenes like this that go so far beyond ever making sense.<br/><br/>The action is pretty cool, and there are some sweet mutant powers like teleportation, diamond skin, and the tight stuff pulled by Creole swindler Remy LeBeau - a.k.a. Gambit. But what was with the CGI? They used it about as much as Star Wars Episode I. Why do lumberjacks need to be computer animated? Why do Wolverine's claws look straight out of a N64 game from 1997? <br/><br/>There are just too many glaring holes to respect this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, believe me... unfortunately, Van Wilder and the N64 claws made that impossible."
"michaellaing71","2","35","75","29 April 2009"," OK for Hugh Jackman fan, rubbish for everyone else
","This film is not good. The script is awful, I wrote better stories when I was 4, Apart from one or two one liners the dialogue is sub par, the story ridiculous, character building is pretty much forgotten, the story clunks along form one fight scene to the next (more about the fight stuff later. The directing and cinematography is uninspired and pretty amateurish. The action scenes are about as exciting as watching socks dry. I have seen it all done before and better in count;ess other film. I hate fast cutting anyway especially in action scene (it can work in some films Bourne being a good example) but here it is done badly and combined with the ropey wire work and below standard special effects.<br/><br/>Due to the script most of the actors are given very little to work with. I can only think of one good one liner and that comes from Liev Schreiber Creed character. Hugh Jackman may look good but isn't given anything decent to say and isn't given a chance to develop the character. Ryan Reynolds is given nothing to do with Deadpool and the he just isn't funny. I must admit to being a big deadpool fan and really hated that they did to him (why do movies have to change successful characters so much and turn them into dog droppings). Taylor Kitsch is OK as Gambit but it feels as if he has just been added in for the sake of getting another popular character on screen The music for the film was OK but kept getting over melodramatic, which isn't helped by the complete disinterest in the charactrs, which means the score is wasted and became annoying after a while This film is a huge mess. I don't think a film should be made badly just because it is a action or comic book film, I like good action films but this film fails in almost every respect. If you want a good x men film go and watch X2 which is much better. If you want a good Marvel film watch Blade 2 or Iron man. If you want to see a good superhero film go and watch the matrix or last 2 batman films which is superior in every way."

X2 didn't let me down, passing all the expectations I had for it. It did exactly what the original film did, but made everything bigger and better. Then, X3 happened. Now, Wolverine takes the franchise back to more solid ground and adds to the legend by perfectly augmenting X2. It tops X2 in action because the fight scenes are larger and much better filmed. Overall, any X-Men fan should be pleased with this movie. If they're not, they were expecting too much Gambit or the Deadpool from the books. I wasn't. So, I'm a pretty happy camper."

","I went into this movie expecting to see a blockbuster. I wanted to see Hughe Jackman bring the character of Wolverine to life one more time, i was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>let me start off with the CGI. It was terrible. The first time Hughe really pulls out his adimantium plated claws out for us to admire they looked like something out of Monsters Inc. The settings were most obviously shot on the green screen, it was so obvious that the character wasn't really there and that detracted so much from the movie. The CGI did seem to pick up abit to the end of the movie, but by then it was to late.<br/><br/>The storyline was equally as bad. There was no character development. I believe this is mostly due to the fact that there were so many characters that a two hour movie would have no time to develop them. Deadpool is seen only at the start and finish of the film and to think he was meant to be the key bad guy, never would have guessed that.<br/><br/>I would have to say that Fox have really ruined what could have been a great movie, no one could ever believe that the money that went into that movie was well spent, if you want a movie with CGI at least make it look good. and a note for Fox, Concepts don't sell the movie, its the content, how you deliver a story, how you develop a character. A movie is meant to stand out and want people like me to tell people it was great. This movie didn't do that at all."

Its a movie full of action from the very first minute, a little of drama, some very good moments of humor and even a little bit of romance and the special effects are excellent. It has a fast paced rhythm making the movie interesting and never tiresome. The cast is really good, Hugh Jackman for the 4th time in the role of Wolverine/Logan, he already dominates this character, it just looks so natural on him. Liv Schreiber was excellent as Sabretooth/Victor, he manages the character to the perfection.

"DonFishies","6","31","66","1 May 2009"," Rushed, silly and all-around disappointing
","Despite the unoriginality of the title, X-Men Origins: Wolverine accomplishes what few titles do: it acknowledges the main character in the film (as played again by Hugh Jackman), and tells the audience exactly what it is going to be about ‚Äì the origin of Wolverine. Crisscrossing around timelines before settling on one undisclosed period before the first X-Men film, Wolverine chronicles how James Logan got his adamantium skeletal frame, how his relationship with Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) began, and everything in-between.<br/><br/>While my small amount of knowledge in regards to X-Men lore is not as vast as others, I had an idea of what to expect from the film story-wise. And while it deviates from the comics in some rather large areas, other parts are fairly true to them.<br/><br/>But in adapting this story to film, the filmmakers stumble right out of the gate. The storyline, as fantastical as it is, descends into silliness and absurdity faster than Wolverine can bring out his claws. I understand the material is based off of a comic franchise, but the filmmakers take this for granted. Instead of fleshing out a jumpy origin story, the film rushes from one point to the next, throwing dialogue and characters at the audience that people will either understand or be completely thrown off by. It takes the time to really make you understand the bond between Wolverine and Sabretooth, but then never makes any of the motivations of anyone else clear. There is so much going on here, and so little explanation that it is a miracle any of this came together at all. The whole film hinges on explaining Wolverine's origins, and what lead him to the gang in X-Men, but the film feels incomplete ‚Äì like something integral is missing.<br/><br/>The X-Men series has always been about a group of people, and this film is no different. But whereas the other films had strong supporting casts backing up the main individuals, this film lacks any good supporting characters. Characters played by Dominic Monaghan, Kevin Durand, Will i Am and Daniel Henney are given so little to do that they could have been played by special effects. Each is given something to do, but so little is done to make them more than one-note that it is a wonder why they are even here in the first place. Other characters, played by the likes of Lynn Collins, the horrendously miscast Taylor Kitsch (who needs accent lessons) and Ryan Reynolds (in another stereotypical wise-ass role) are integral to the film, but have no time to really prove themselves as being useful to the film. They merely stand as plot devices, and items that the like of Jackman and Schreiber use to move from point A to point B. They have a point, but the filmmakers care less in giving them any real motivations or emotions. If they do not care, then why should an audience? <br/><br/>If the story and the acting were a bit out of touch, the CGI fares even worse. In some scenes, it looks just fantastic and smoothly developed. In others, it looks fake and rushed. The bootleg copy of the film that circulated online before the movie opened apparently had very little special effects in place. That came out a month ago. Was that the working version of the film at that point, and everything else has been added in since? It would make sense for how patchy of a job some scenes look and how incredibly horrendous others look. Even simple scenes involving Wolverine's claws, which should look quite realistic by this point four films in, look horrible. Even the makeup effects (especially for one key character) are laughably bad. I know the film had its problems on-set and in post-production, but there is no excuse anyone could make for how bad some scenes look. When dated films from years past look better than something current, I think there is a problem.<br/><br/>The villains played by Schreiber and Danny Huston are the most interesting part of the film. While not as key to the film as Wolverine himself, both deliver excellent performances that belong in better movies. Huston is deliciously evil as always, using his face to hint at ulterior motives while saying something else entirely. Schreiber gives a level of depth and ferocity that was totally missing from Tyler Mane's original performance in the first film. The animal of a man Schreiber becomes is nothing short of excellent. Both actors take the film seriously, even at its most ridiculous moments, and they make something of their roles that none of the supporting cast really attempts. Perhaps their scenes were not as cut up as others, but watching them act alongside anyone is proof that there is some form of a good movie buried deep within X-Men Origins: Wolverine.<br/><br/>But the real strength of the film belongs to Jackman. He nails everything about Wolverine from his attitudes, to his mannerisms, to his behaviours. This is his most physical portrayal of the character, and it works the best because of how concrete and involved Jackman is. He knows this character, and never once does he leave him. He never falters. He dives headfirst into every scene he is in, and he gives it every single one the same amount of depth and complexity to make the character a real entity. This is not just a simple comic book character. We can see the layers of emotion, and the scarring this character goes through.<br/><br/>I was not expecting a lot from X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but I got even less than I wanted. The film feels too rushed, too silly to truly be what was originally envisioned for this film. Jackman, Schreiber and Huston all make it work, and make it watchable because they genuinely try; even with the often horrendous material they are given. I just hope this is not the beginning of a lousy summer.<br/><br/>6/10."

","I am a big fan of the original trilogy of X-Men films. Wolverine is my favourite character so I was really looking forward to watching this. <br/><br/>I think the idea to learn more about his early life was a good idea. There was plenty of good over the top action and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is superb as usual but the story just wasn't as interesting as it could have been. It was just the kind of film where after 20 minutes it became very predictable. <br/><br/>Overall I would still recommend this film, whether you have seen the original trilogy or not it should be quite easy to follow. It was decent viewing, a good addition to the series but not as good as the others. <br/><br/>7/10"

","Sure, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not the best movie ever made, but it sure gives you one heck of a good time. This spin off film has all the elements of the original X-Men trilogy that made it so good to watch. There was a good, easy story-line, great characters, good acting/directing, and just a purpose to entertain the audience. That holds true for this film.<br/><br/>This is essentially a prequel that tells the origin of the iconic character, Wolverine. This film goes in-depth on his relationship with his half-brother and how a high government official, Stryker wants to control all mutants.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Hugh Jackman gives all his best in his Wolverine character. There are good supporting roles by Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston.<br/><br/>Overall, I had a very fun time watching this action-packed movie.

"Tobbes","1","26","54","1 May 2009"," The single worst superhero movie I have ever seen
","Wow, Fox, I'm almost speechless. With the background of Wolverine, it is almost an art form of it's own to produce a movie that isn't even remotely interesting, exciting or even entertaining. Or a movie with a story that would fit on a post-it. And - with a main character like Wolverine, mind you - not one funny line in the dialog. But all that was accomplished fabulously. You created a rather boring movie with no story and some of the worst dialog I've ever heard. The whole movie feels like a rather random sequence of scenes where assorted mutants and wolverine show of their powers. Now one might say that it's a comic book movie and effects and colorful lights really are the main point of interest in such a movie. And while I don't agree with that myself, this statement has a point. But Wolverine also fails on that ground. Some of the SFX and CGI are quite good, but for the most part the range is from mediocre to really bad. And that is inexcusable.<br/><br/>I could go on for a long time stating the failings of this movie, but I have wasted enough time on this horrible mess. One question is still to be answered for those who like the X-Men and have have seen the other three. Is it worse than the third one? Oh yes! Much, much worse.<br/><br/>Take this as a friendly warning. Don't waste your time. It sucks. Bad."
"Rodrigo_Amaro","10","7","11","28 August 2010"," Surprisingly Great!
","This is something rare of me saying that a movie featuring a hero is THAT good. I know the characters, although almost haven't watched the cartoons or read the comic books, but I watched the 3 other X-Men films and they're great. With this one I loved everything. The action scenes were incredibly well made, breathtaking, no shaky camera and all of it was involving (my favorite was the last one). And even more rare than my opinion is the dramatic scenes, who were very good too. Everything was balanced here and the result is not disappointing despite some exaggerations. <br/><br/>Logan/Wolverine returns (or better, forget everything this movie is about his past) played by the great Hugh Jackman. His story is told since he was a child and then it evolves in his fighting on many wars. He and his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are approached by a group of mercenaries conducted by William Straker (Danny Huston in the role given to Brian Cox in ""X2""), when something goes wrong and Logan decides to leave the team, while his brother stays with them. The story jumps again, he mets a girlfriend and he's happy until Victor and Stryker reapers trying to convince Logan join a new experiment involving transformation of the mutants power. And then the fights begin...<br/><br/>The transformation of Wolverine might have countless clich√©s but still makes this movie worth watching. The visual effects were right on the target, very well made. The casting was fabulous (even Will.I.Am was great playing a mutant, sort of like the same powers of Nightcrawler). Director Gavin Hood made a terrific job here and I sincerely hope that Hollywood calls him again to make a similar movie or perhaps the X-Men Origins of another member of the team. What else can I say? I really loved it and I wasn't bored at all which is something that happens in some pictures of the genre. 10/10"
"helmutty","7","19","38","1 May 2009"," Wolverine the entertainer.
","All of X-men movies are pretty enjoyable and entertaining. The recent movie, X-men 3 is loud and entertaining at best. Now comes X-men origins: Wolverine is a prequel. It does its job to entertain people with its brutal and intense fight/action scenes and people will be engaged in the warped and mixed feelings of the mutants especially Wolverine. He has a tragic past that makes people feel sorry for him. We get the ruthless Victor Creed, who is known as Sabretooth, not being as cold-hearted as I thought. I am not familiarised with X-men or their origins, I have only watched the movies but i do know that X-men is one of the most popular Marvel comic.<br/><br/>The story: Everything has its own past. Logan known as Wolverine is happy living his life working as a lumberjack and seeing his girlfriend everyday. Until then, William Stryker comes and destroy their lives. Wolverine becomes revengeful. I can't spoil the twists and turns or major story plot to those who are not familiarised with the story. The pace moves briskly. It is action-packed with some explosive action and also packed with mutants like well-know Gambit and Deadpool.<br/><br/>Overall: It is not as bad as what some people say and it is also not as good as what other people say. But it is somewhere in the middle where you can enjoy watching it. Those who are not familiarised with the Wolverine's origins and want to know should catch this. Those who cannot get enough of X-men movies should be able to enjoy this or not. It is not the best or the worst marvel comic movie."

","Assuming I knew nothing about the real origins story, I didn't notice all the editing/cgi problems, and that I didn't notice major flaws - this movie was still just alright. <br/><br/>Marvel just decided to cash a check this time - The story was mediocre and rushed, the special effects were terrible considering todays standards(I am talking about the theatrical version), the editing didn't make sense at times, the mutants powers didn't even seem right, and for a movie about Wolverine, there was a lot of other character development which isn't bad but personally I went to see Wolverine. Also I'm not asking for a gore fest but when someone gets impaled, I expect at least one drop of blood.<br/><br/>The movie isn't bad but its sub par and not what it should have been"
"dillyboy_4","6","24","50","30 April 2009"," Should've been better
","What makes the Wolverine character so compelling in the comics is his psyche. It's not his claws, or his strength, or his anger, but how he deals with all three that make him such a varied and interesting part of the Marvel universe. Unfortunately, X-Men Origins: Wolverine gets everything wrong. Instead of being the story about a man who evolves and changes as his experience shapes him, the film is pretty much dedicated to action and sacrifices what made previous iterations in the X-Men series so good. This film should've focused on Wolverine and his own conflict, rather than simply have him running around trying to exact revenge on his brother.<br/><br/>Speaking of Sabretooth, he's probably the part of the film that made the least amount of sense. Wolverine is after him for killing his wife, modifies his body to kill him, and then SAVES him at the end. It completely defeats the point of the overarching revenge story, and makes the film confusing in that respect.<br/><br/>During the war, as well, I don't understand why Wolverine is such a good person. He killed an adult as a child, for God's Sake. His brain is damaged, and he should've had mountains of hostility, like his brother. Instead, Wolverine is shown as a contrasting ""good guy"" to his brother, which didn't make any sense. The character didn't evolve at all in this film, and all of his relationships with other characters were confusing and ruined by the plot. I also liked how, for some reason, Wolverine receiving his jacket from an older couple was more of an evolution for the character than killing people in the war. The film gave it more screen time than some of the most important moments in Wolverine's life.<br/><br/>This is an average film, and nothing more. The plot is convoluted, it tries to be an action film when it shouldn't and the acting is simply alright. It's a good popcorn movie to see in theatres, but it's not going to be remembered the way the first X-Men movie was."

","Just got back from an advance screening of Wolverine, and I have to say it was pretty darn good! Visually its spectacular, and the acting is top notch. Liev Schrieber does a really great job as Sabretooth, and both Taylor Kitsch and Will.i.am were good as Gambit and Wraith respectively. Also good to see that Dominic Monaghan's character ended up being Bolt instead of Beak as originally rumoured! Die-hard comic fans may need to beware, as there's a few characters that are changed somewhat from the comics. Some subtly (like Agent Zero), some vastly (like Deadpool), but ultimately not so much that it detracts from the film's story (it is, after all, a different continuity to the comics - X-Men fans would do well to remember this going into this movie!). There's also lots of character cameos, with one near the end of the film being icing on the cinematic cake! Stick around after the credits start rolling for not one but two vignettes!"

Hugh Jackman returned as Wolverine, Sabertooth was back, Deadpool and Gambit we're getting their shot. Oh how we were so innocent. With visual effects that are exceedingly laughable and cheap, (especially compared to the originals) butchering classic characters, and giving us an unnecessary love story.

"yennil","6","2","2","28 September 2016"," Okay movie, not the most memorable of them all though
","I am a huge fan of the X-Men movies. That being said, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was not as great as it could have been. Here, we have a classic modern hero story where the main character, the Wolverine, is angsty and struggling with personal image, that of which many people today identify with. He fits perfectly into today's society's image of a hero because he has overcome pain and suffering, gone through a heartbreak, and now fights for what he believes in. Even though it is clear that the Wolverine is a superhero, he is on the verge of a tragic hero. Hugh Jackman's acting adds significantly to the plot, drawing emotions from the audience perfectly; however, his acting still couldn't hide the fact that all the parts of the story were too much for the movie to handle.<br/><br/>Although the back story was told well, there were many components that the directors unsuccessfully told. In this movie, there is quite a number of tragic heroes. Some might think this is good because it adds drama to the story and is pretty interesting in general, but there were too many characters that came and went, making the story too hard for me to imagine and follow along with. The directors try almost too hard to incorporate all of the original characters, and it turns out pretty sloppy. Still, the movie is enjoyable because it has the ending that viewers will be satisfied with and can easily take away. It has a moral that aligns with all of the modern hero movies: that the things you perceive are not always true to nature, but it's the way you deal with that situation that makes you worthy of success in the end. Overall, this adequately addresses the struggles in the Wolverine's life and fulfilled my neutral expectations."

I may have overseen something, but in general this is an unforgivable movie mistake.

"TheLittleSongbird","5","2","2","25 July 2014"," Not a bad film by all means, but Wolverine did deserve a better origin story
","The first X-Men film was fun and well-made though with a beginning-of-the-franchise-not-yet-properly-finding-its-feet feel; X-Men 2 was very, very good indeed and an example of a bigger and darker sequel better than the original(even if it wasn't quite perfect either) and X-Men 3 The Last Stand while nowhere near as bad as its reputation was disappointing(after being so impressed by the previous two) and a step-back in the franchise. X-Men Origins: Wolverine had much going for it but while it is nowhere near a bad film it could have delivered more, considering that this was an origins prequel story. X-Men Origins: Wolverine does have good things, it's well shot and edited(if a little rapid in a couple of the fighting sequences), the special effects are nicely executed and not used too much and the dark, gritty style of the previous three films is wisely maintained, nothing overblown or static here. The opening sequence is robust and exciting and gives you the sense of ""looks like we're in for a treat here"", most of the action sequences have tension and thrills especially at the end(which also makes a real effort to tie up loose ends), Sabretooth/Victor and Stryker are well-realised and there are a few good performances. Wolverine may be too ambivalent character-development-wise but Hugh Jackman's charisma and grizzled demeanour is pitched perfectly, Liev Schreiber brings real meat, toughness and menace to Victor/Sabretooth and Danny Huston as the villain Stryker is both classy and ruthless and does them very effectively, Stryker avoids being too one-dimensional. Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Kitsch do what they can and are quite good. <br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine does suffer however from a lot of the same things that X-Men The Last Stand had. The script is very contrived and in a worse way than X-Men The Last Stand, emotional moments are forced, exposition and any explanations are underdeveloped and any bits of humour are on the broad side(X-Men 2 especially avoided this and had a much more even balance). The story has some good atmosphere and good scenes and has some tension, but it does try to cram in too much and things feel rushed and not as developed as they ought. Gavin Hood does reasonably admirably in the action but very like Brett Ratner he is surprisingly not as comfortable in the non-action scenes, in a way that the writing and story, that should give the film depth, are sacrificed by the action(again mostly very good, apart from ones that did lag and you couldn't always tell who was who). Apart from Sabretooth and Stryker (Wolverine was written much better in the first two films but Jackman's presence did make up for things), the characters are disappointingly written, especially Deadpool who had a lot of potential but disappears just like that and appears even more abruptly much later at a stage where you think they've forgotten all about him. Gambit was also treated fairly insignificantly, and other characters like Blob and Kayla(Lynn Collins' acting is wooden in this part) are pretty useless. It doesn't have the too many characters problem like The Last Stand did but it like that film doesn't develop or write the characters well but not as insultingly. On a side note one positive review said that they couldn't understand why The Last Stand and this got criticised for the characters and the first two get a free pass; actually the first two films have been criticised for under-utilising characters and bad acting in them, namely Cyclops and Storm, but at least they tried to respect the characters and not distort them or deprive them of personality like this and Last Stand did(and this is NOT coming from a comic-book purist, far from it, you don't even need to have read an X-Men comic to have this criticism). Harry Gregson-Williams' score has some excitement and induces some suspense but at other points it's too over-bearing and strident, of the X-Men films this film had the least effective score in my opinion. Will.i.Am being cast in an X-Men film would cause alarm bells and his performance is not any better, it felt out of place. <br/><br/>To conclude, could have been better but it's not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Tweekums","7","2","2","29 December 2013"," Enjoyable if slightly inferior X-Men Prequel
","Set before the original trilogy this film follows Logan and his brother Victor from their birth two hundred years ago up to the moment Logan's memory is eliminated. In the opening scenes we find the pair fighting in various wars from the American Civil War to Vietnam where Col. Stryker realises that there is something special about the pair. He sets up a unit of super-powered mutants in order to capture other mutants but before long Logan becomes disenchanted and leaves. He settles down in Canada but his brother comes looking for him and kills his girlfriend. Stryker offers to give Logan the means to kill Victor but after the process is complete Logan hears him give the order to erase his memory and escapes. The process replaced his skeleton with the almost indestructible metal adamantium so Logan is tougher than ever and determined to get his revenge against Victor and Stryker.<br/><br/>Of all the mutants from the original X-Men films Wolverine was the obvious choice to make the main character in a prequel as we have learnt enough to know it should be interesting. Of course one problem with any film about a character's back story is that there is less sense of danger¬Ö before it even begins we know that Logan will survive but loose his memory. That doesn't mean characters we haven't seen before will make it though. There is a decent amount of action though; much of it fairly physical due to the nature of the featured mutant's powers. Hugh Jackman does a fine job as Wolverine but while the rest of the cast aren't bad they don't stand out the way he does. Fans of the original films may be pleased to see another original character being introduced as well as a brief cameo from another. Overall I'd say that while this wasn't great it was better than I had expected; it is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the original films."
"hothouseinc","1","17","34","1 May 2009"," Worst Marvel Story EVER!!!
","This entire post contains many spoilers as I bring light to the many ways this movie stunk! This movie, in one well-dealt blow, has forever destroyed the X-Men franchise. The time-line, characters, and continuity are destroyed and will never be able to be reclaimed. It was one thing to take some mild liberty's with the X-Men story; Bobby(Iceman) a child when Logan joins up, Bobby(Iceman) and Marie(Rogue) with the love interest, Bobby(Iceman and Kitty(Shadowcat) with the love interest(and just what the hell is it with making Bobby the catalyst that keeps screwing things up anyway??), Jean manifesting as Phoenix in Canada instead of NY/Space, Piotr(Colossus) a child in the second movie when Logan(Wolverine) returns, etc. Still there the characters were ""fairly"" true to the books and the original character design. But this?? This piece of garbage that portrays Logan(""Jimmy""?????) and Victor as brothers by blood? They fight with each other side by side for decades? Logan gets his adamantium enhancement via the US Gov't as an experiment to make ""Weapon XI"", not the Canadian Gov't as Project: Weapon X and a future operative for Alpha Flight?? Deadpool is the ultimate mutant killer with healing factor, teleportation, AND optic blasts and swords in his arms???? Who thought this crap up? And what was Stan Lee doing when they passed this by him? recovering from a coma? Or still induced in one??<br/><br/>Pitting Remy LeBeau as the shifty, shady, gambler who is Logans guide back to ""the Isle""(Genosha??) was moronic. His presence alone throws things off forever. Now, with Gambit in his late 20s/early 30s and Rogue presumably still in high school at this point, there can be romantic interest between them. Continuity destroyed. With Deadpool being this ""Silent"" super killer, there will never again be the mouthy assassin for hire ever again in any of the follow up storys/cross-overs. Characters destroyed. With Scott(Cyclops) having been at this ""Isle""(Was it or wasn't it Genosha????) when Logan helped do whatever it was he was doing there and Professor X coming in to save them all(shouldn't they all have been X-Men shortly there after then???), there can be no initial X-Men recruiting(the original 5 having been Scott Summers, Jean Grey, Bobby Drake, Hank McCoy, and Warren Worthington III{OH CRAP! thats right, that time-line is already screwed up by the X-Men movies themselves!!}). Timeline Destroyed! This movie should've been titled ""Altermate Universe Origins: Wolverine"". Then they could've taken as much artistic license as they wanted and not screwed up anything. Such as it is, all us loyal fans of the books and stories have to go to these crap movies now with an open mind as to how things are going to be reinvented for us who have taken the time in our lives to follow what was already laid out by people far more talented than the hacks who are picking it up. Nothing will ever be as we have known it, and to try to back track and redo it(like was done with The Incredible Hulk story) would not only throw everything off, but would further insult fans of the books everywhere.<br/><br/>Allow me to sum up with all the spoilers I can spoil: Logan and Victor are NOT brothers. Logan and Victor NEVER teamed with Deadpool. Fred Dukes was NEVER skinny. Kayla(Silverfox) IS NOT related to Emma Frost(Diamond girl). Kayla(Silverfox) NEVER betrayed Logan to anyone. Logan was found by the Hudsons, James and Heather, but they were neither elderly nor farmers. The Hudsons were Canadian Gov't Operatives, Vindicator and Guardian, and leading members of Alpha Flight, who later convinced Logan that joining Alpha Flight was a good thing. Scott(Cyclops) was NEVER captured by Sabertooth for experimentation by Col. Stryker and was recruited, with the consent of his parents from high school into The Xavier Institute for Gifted Youngsters, by Professor Charles Xavier, NOT rescued from some weirdo US Gov't facility by him. Remy had no prior interaction with Logan UNTIL meeting the X-Men. Deadpool IS NOT SILENT!!!! His non-stop incessant banter goes so far as to be exponentially more annoying that Spider-Mans!!!! All this and SO MUCH MORE! If you can get past all this, if you can disregard that it took years of amazingly creative peoples talents and hard work to create these characters, and this time-line, and these stories, if you can get beyond that the story is forever muddled into some ridiculous jumble of mish-mashed characters, interactions, team-ups, and nonsense, then you will love the hell out of this movie. it is the ultimate, corporate, money-making, action film for the sake of having some money from an action film. But, if on the other hand you care about these stories and these characters and the creativity it has taken to make them and bring them to you, you will likely agree with me that this straw was not just broken the camels back. It's ripped it out, smashed it into a thousand pieces, and fed it to the dying camel while laughing in its face!"
"TimBoHannon","2","24","51","5 May 2009"," This Movie is a Total Waste of Time and Money
","Three years is a long time to wait. For some, it is a wait for redemption after ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" relentlessly assaulted what made the X-Men so appealing in the first place and grandly blasphemed two of its most beloved characters. For those who enjoyed the movie, it is the anticipation of seeing another story in the unique world of mutants. Shame on Marvel Enterprises and Fox Studios for violating the hope of the first group and the trust of the second.<br/><br/>""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has five major problems. First, it has too many mutants to develop. I am familiar with each character and still felt overwhelmed. Second, there is too little substance to the story. Third, the action has too much glitz and too little entertainment. Fourth, writers David Benioff and Skip Woods mangle already established fact. Finally, a great many mutants are altered from their original form. That final error, while not noticeable to some viewers, is possibly the deadliest offense to fans of the X-Men cannon.<br/><br/>There are 11 significant mutants in the story, and that does not count minor characters. The original ""X-Men"" has ten total. The most well-known mutants are included in those ten. That is one difference. Also, ""X-Men"" has at most half as much action as this movie. Less character time is needed in ""X-Men,"" yet more is given. That focus adds importance to both the story and the violence. Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), the Blob (Kevin Durand), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney, giving one of the movie's coolest and most focused performances), and especially Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), are most gypped by ""Wolverine."" <br/><br/>As Roger Ebert has often pointed out, Wolverine, also called Logan (Hugh Jackman), possesses powers that are mundane compared to those of Storm, who can control the weather, or Magneto, who can rip a train car in two with the power of his will alone, or even this movie's Emma Frost (exceedingly beautiful Tahyna Tozzi), who can turn her skin into diamonds. Wolverine's appeal arises from his aggression and his struggle to remember his past and its unknown hurts. The movie never really investigates what formed Logan into the one of the most unique personalities in Marvel Comics. His motivations, the emotional impact of his decisions, the exploration of his nature, and later-forgotten trauma are insufficiently explored. Of the four X-Men stories released to date, this one should be the slowest and most thoughtful. It is the fastest and least thoughtful.<br/><br/>Like Marc Forster in ""Quantum of Solace,"" director Gavin Hood looks totally lost trying to choreograph action. Imagine watching a baseball game where the camera appears so close to the baseball that we cannot see the hitter until the very last instant. Without a good view of the baseball's position in the environment around it, it is difficult to see how it travels from the pitcher's hand to home plate. That is similar to the effect created by zooming the camera in too far during action. The action in ""Wolverine"" is mostly close-quarters involving unnaturally fast moving people. Hood also uses way too much fancy trash. I lost count of how many double-sideways flips someone performs during a fight. One of them involves teleportation, but falls way short of the Riddick vs. Lord Marshal battle from ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" <br/><br/>One of the high points of ""X2"" is Logan's discovery of the room where his memories were lost and his metal claws gained. His flashbacks, combined with a later conversation with Colonel Stryker, provide an outline of what occurred. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" clearly establishes itself as a prequel, not a separate movie. Therefore, it should not ignore what we learned in ""X2."" <br/><br/>""Wolverine"" not only does that, its replacement story far less compelling. Logan's signature personality is neutered even after his breaking point. He was never supposed to be a peaceful man. Whatever happened to ""You were always an animal, all I did was give you claws""? William Stryker's (Danny Huston in a role previously manned by Brian Cox) behavior when threatened and the later consequences make his status in ""X2"" impossible to believe. The timeline places ""X-Men"" far earlier than it claims to be. Even the story behind Logan's amnesia is cringe-worthy. What previous movies establish needs to be honored.<br/><br/>Another problem is Logan's self-healing abilities. As in ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" he has become too invincible. Judging by his rate of healing in the first two X-Men movies, he survives at least two traumas that should be enough to kill him. Agent Zero of the comic books can nullify Logan's healing factor and absorb damage to his own body. His only skill here is good aim. Jason Bourne has good aim. Police snipers have good aim. That is not a superhuman ability. Deadpool spends so little time on screen that including him in the promotional material borders on false advertising. Logan's final battle is against an enemy whose signature weapon rips off both Optimus Prime and ""Castlevania: Curse of Darkness."" The second may sound ho-hum, but many comic book nerds love gaming too.<br/><br/>This movie simply has far too many problems and too few redeeming factors. It proves that the X-Men series has not merely had a bad day. It has completely jumped the shark and is all but certainly beyond redemption. Taking Marvel's most popular character and making a dead-on-arrival movie shows serious incompetence from the creative team. The ending answers all questions, but those answers are not worth a free ticket to see the movie. My only wish is that I could forget the entire movie, except for the fact that it is despicable."

","I just went to see Wolverine tonight, and from the previews i thought it looked pretty good. I really enjoyed the film, with great action and great special effects. The story was intriguing and i wish it didn't end. Even though it was only 100 minutes, it didn't feel rushed at all. The new mutants introduced in this movie are pretty cool and are a good replacement for the old ones. I thought Gambit and Deadpool were the best. The film leaves some questions unanswered, but i'm sure it was for a good reason (sequel?). If you have 2 hours and ten bucks, i recommend you go watch the new installation in the x-men franchise. Well worth it."

","I saw this movie about two or three weeks ago. Although giving it 9.5/10 is respectable enough, a 6.8 rating on IMDb isn't. I found this movie to have a respectful length, however, some parts did lack depth: For example, Wolverine ages throughout the movie, however, why does he stop aging at around 35-40 years old? However, while the special effects could be a lot better, the action sequences were breathtaking and just...awesome! The acting was also pretty good. Hugh Jackman again proves that HE is Wolverine, but Liev Schreiber proves also that HE could be Sabretooth in an upcoming X-Men movie. Seriously, he was excellent. But there were parts that, it seemed to me, were rushed or either had additional material that were probably cut from the finished movie. For instance, it seems that whenever Wolverine searches for information, he finds it too quickly, whether it be an article from the newspaper or his good buddy Will.I.Am. Also, once you've played the Uncaged edition of the video game, it feels as if the movie was extremely censored. I hope they release an Unrated/Extended cut when it comes out on DVD, but for now, this movie is an excellent piece of amusement."

","The pace is great and the action is unbelievable. I couldn't believe that almost two hours had gone by when it was over. Visually, it's a sight to behold, with impressive special effects and a dynamic sense of presence. I really think this is one of the best comic book movies ever, and I'm not exaggerating. It's not as complex as Iron Man or The Dark Knight but it's loaded with intense fun. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better then what we saw in X3. I'm glad they decided to head in this direction because X4 might have gone off the tracks even more and this movie proves that focusing on one X-Man may be the way to go with a lot of supporting help. Characters find their own distinctiveness and just flat out kick butt. The plot avoids pitfalls as the situations become more dire. They're a group of characters who are well written (for the massive size and scope of this epic) and full of small, personal moments that transcend their four-color origins. Well done."

","While fan boys of the Marvel comics will be upset on how Deadpool plays out... Sorry fellas, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>But the movie's major focus is between Wolverine and Sabertooth and how it leads up to Wolverine joining the Weapon X program.<br/><br/>While the movie is poorly scripted and character development is lacking with only showing cameos of characters to say ""we are showing these characters for a bit"" much like Gambit whose role is short in the film.<br/><br/>Definitely not this seasons blockbuster but I would suggest waiting to view it on DVD or wait for it to hit cable/DTV/Dish networks. But the film is not worth the $8+ to see for a few hours of wooden entertainment. If Fox would start looking into quality instead of quantity, maybe Hollywood wouldn't be asking for bailouts."

","Wolverine Origins is one badass comic book movie. It's been a long time since I've seen a comic book movie that was all about action and wasn't about caped-crusader morals or sophisticated plots. If you're going to see this, don't expect a Watchmen or Dark Knight, or even an X-Men. Expect a non-stop-explosion-fest of a movie. And what's really amazing about this movie is that it's fast paced - when it finished I was surprised at how fast it went by.<br/><br/>The only negatives about the movie was the acting, (especially by Lynn Collins. She's a bloody robot in this movie and the lines sound so forced.) and the camera angles- most of the shots were too close up and we rarely got shots that were wide - some scenes felt too compressed.<br/><br/>Other than that, I was really satisfied with this movie.

"baumer","9","22","47","21 April 2009"," Let the summer begin!
","X-Men Wolverine<br/><br/>Contains massive spoilers<br/><br/>Let the summer begin. This is one hell of a ride and it certainly lives up to my expectations. Wolverine's story has always been an interesting one and this film, as it delves into all that we know about Logan and his Wolverine alter ego is simply fantastic. I am not a comic collector, so I knew absolutely nothing about Wolverine before seeing X-Men. Now here we are four movies later and he is easily one of the best heroes on screen.<br/><br/>We start off in the Northwest Territories in the 1800's. A young Logan murders his own father, not knowing of course that he is. As he runs out of the house, his brother catches up to him and tells him that they must look out for each other. They both have gifts that can't be explained. So, he and Victor do what they do best. They fight in every single war known in American history. How they got to enlist in the American army is kind of confusing since they are both Canadian, but I guess that doesn't really matter. Soon, General Stryker comes calling after they have both been executed by firing squad. He wants to start up a special unit of mutants. He takes them to Nigeria to search for some kind of rock that can turn one into an indestructible being. But of course, to benefit from this rock, one must have regenerating healing capabilities. Since Logan is the only one who does, the task at hand is to get him to agree to it. To do this, the military sets him up. They kill his girlfriend, and then they promise him that they can help him avenge her death by making him strong enough to go after Victor, his brother, who killed her.<br/><br/>Once he becomes Wolverine, the film really takes off. It was good up to this point, but it gets fantastic once he becomes the indestructible animal. He discovers that what was once wooden like claws that came out of his hands, are now razor sharp and steel that can cut metal. Although he knew he could take bullets, regenerate and basically recover much quicker than a normal human being, his abilities are now heightened. This government experiment has made him more of an animal than he once was.<br/><br/>Soon he is on the hunt for his brother and this takes him to meet Gambit and all kinds of other mutants. The final showdown takes place on ""Mutant Island"" and it does not disappoint.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins Wolverine is action packed from start to finish. The ending is especially satisfying as Professor X makes an appearance and you get to see some of the young mutants who will eventually appear in the three X-Men films. I found the story to flow and I enjoyed the performances of Jackman and Live Schreiber immensely. Gavin Hood, who's only other Hollywood credit is Rendition with Reese Witherspoon and Jake Gyllenhal, does a masterful job keeping the action rolling, the fights exhilarating and the performances crisp and accurate. I don't know much about Mr. Hood, but I think he might get a lot more work after this film.<br/><br/>Seeing as I do not know anything about the Wolverine lore or the story I went into this just looking for a good time and something to keep me entertained. If the X-Men loonies have something to complain about, it goes over my head. This is a perfect film to kick off the summer and if the rest of the summer films of 2009 are anything near as good as this, we'll be in for a great 4 months.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Copy-X","4","17","35","28 April 2009"," Wolverine Origins storyline drops ""Dead""
","If you are a fan of the X-Men series at all(excluding the movies 1-3), then you know the story of Wolverine is a legend. This movie, however, is everything but that.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman does a marvelous job, no doubt, he is the best Wolverine we will ever have. I place blame for this movie on the producers, screen writers and the like, not the actors. At every turn in the story, they choose to shut down everything that made Wolverine what he was. <br/><br/>--If you know anything about the original comic book universe, then you know that Wolverine did not have bone claws until after Magneto ripped the adamantium from his body. After that, his body had been so used to having claws that it made it's own from dense bone. --Wolverine's wife died, that was a driving point behind his existence, why he was the way he was. You take the rage out of the character if she is still alive. Which leads to... --Wolverine went to Japan, where he learned to fight, as well as control himself. --Wolverine was kidnapped for Project X and forced to have Adamantium injected into him. --There was no collecting of mutants. --There was no Project ""Deadpool""<br/><br/>Honestly, I could pick this movie to death, but that would get pretty boring for you fast. So...<br/><br/>""Project Deadpool"" - The absolute worst part of this movie, the cherry on the cake, the FINAL FIGHT, against Deadpool. Whoever decided to make Deadpool a uncharismatic drone should be removed from their spot as a designer for all out sakes. Deadpool is one of the most entertaining, unique and cunning Marvel characters, and now has been reduced to little more than a thug, a cheap copy. Honestly, there are no words I am allowed to write here to express my rage at this short coming, which is putting it lightly.<br/><br/>I will go see the movie, however, against my better judgement. I will grit my teeth until they bleed because it will be so painful to see a story like this slaughtered by ill-informed, pop- culture rejects. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so devoted to being a geek.<br/><br/>TLDR - If you know anything about X-Men and Wolverine, this movie is almost not worth seeing, go watch it during the daytime when it's cheaper. For everyone else, you'll love it."
"lawrencedevorejr","4","19","40","3 May 2009"," Extremely disappointing
","There is absolutely no excuse for not using the rich history of Wolverine from the Marvel Comics archives. If Marvel Entertainment (Avi Arad / Stan Lee) is going to be involved in the production of their titles, they should insist on using the story lines from their comics with as little modification as possible. All of the actors brought life to their characters. But, the story just disappointed. I was especially surprised by Gambit. I like the actor who played him. He's from the TV show on NBC, ""Friday Night Lights"". Hugh Jackman brought Wolverine to life as he's done in the previous X-men movies. Liev Schreiber did an excellent job as Sabretooth."
"joestank15","5","18","38","1 May 2009"," Has ""rushed"" written on it's forehead.
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine - We see Logan (Hugh Jackman)'s past, or a summary of it in the opening credits, and then flash forward to...either the 70's or 80's. I'm not sure. It's not very clear. In any case, the film follows Wolverine and Sabretooth and *sigh* another too long list of mutants through various shenanigans. There are some decent fights and a few funny and/or awesome moments, but it's unsatisfying overall.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with what should have been better than X-men3 and probably X2 as well. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber do their best and bring their A-game. Ryan Reynolds should have had far more to do in this film as he was great. Unfortunately writers Skip Woods (Hitman. ugh) and David Benioff cannot claim the same. The story is rushed and there are multiple points one just cannot get their head around. Why is Sabretooth doing the things he does? What is Stryker's ultimate goal and why does he get an entire sect of the American military to go along with essentially stupid ideas, in Canada no less? Why does it take a plane trip to get to a place we later see has bridge access to it? <br/><br/>What is apparent from these X-Men films is that two hours cannot support the number of characters they cram in. The fact that this was a Wolverine movie should have cued the writers into the notion that we want more Wolverine. It did not. The script is not awful, but offers little room for Wolverine to actually brood or have character moments or do anything but go from point A to point B. No one is really allowed to do much but confer plot, which is bad, because the writers gave little thought to the plot or the character treatments. Deadpool is more or less tarnished and Gambit's part is pretty insignificant.<br/><br/>What we have here is an unfinished feeling film due to a poor story. Admittedly, the X-Men comics were never as much about story as they were about cool looking characters dealing with isolation and whining about their pathetic lives inspite of their awesome powers. Nevertheless, Jackman and Schreiber deserved a better movie to be built around them. It's not bad, but I'll always wonder how much better a film this would have been if David Hayter has scripted it.

","I saw this amazingly disappointing film along with millions of others. I was going to write my stock comment about Marvel not being able to make anything cinematic. But I wondered why. It has something more than respect for the drawn comic panel, where every scene had been storyboarded and shot as if it were a storyboard.<br/><br/>Then I remembered and rewatched "" A Fish called Wanda."" That had the same smell. <br/><br/>The problem is simple I think. They start with the action shots. These incidentally involve characters, okay, buy that. These have to have lives. Okay. The lives have to have history, connections, reality. Nope, too much trouble, so let's just connect up some genre fragments. Family? Add sibling rivalry and a dash of parental abuse based on misunderstanding. Romance? Add in something that later you can devalue by having be pretend.<br/><br/>The problem is that instead of situating the film in a world ‚Äî any world ‚Äî and then identify some narratives, which then have dramatic color, they start with the color, going backwards. They never get to the world, which is why all the narrative seems external, remote.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"SebaZava","6","13","26","4 May 2009"," Definitely could have been much better
","The Wolverine character was first introduced - cinematically - in Bryan Singer's first X-Men movie. There, he was presented as a tough, violent individual who knew very little about his past, and even less about how he got his awesome powers. That was part of the film's charm - that one of its main characters was a complete mystery, and the way this mystery was treated was very effective. The purpose of Origins is to reveal this mystery, but I'm not sure if it was a very good idea in the first place.<br/><br/>Unless you know nothing about he movie, you probably know that it eventually shows Logan taking part of the Weapon X program - it shows how he gets his adamantium skeleton and claws. The thing is, this part of the movie should have been treated as more important. There's no suspense towards this very significant transformation. No anticipation. The sequence itself last little more than 15 minutes, and ends up with Logan escaping - quite easily - from Stryker's grasp. And then, I also thought his lack of memory had to do with the experiment itself, but it doesn't. The way his amnesia - which is a very important aspect of the original X-Men flicks - is explained is one of the most disappointing aspects of the film - a very idiotic and ultimately senseless explanation indeed.<br/><br/>If there's one level I thought the movie worked beautifully, it's action-wise. There are quite a few action set pieces, and every one of them work on their own right. Granted, I'm not saying there's anything particularly groundbreaking in here - actually, movies like the aforementioned Iron Man and The Dark Knight and even The Incredible Hulk were more successful because they were actually capable of gathering suspense - but it all looks pretty cool. The thing is, I actually never though any of this characters were in danger - although that's maybe because both Wolverine and Victor are almost immortal beings. Visually, there's nothing particularly striking - the CGI is at times competent and at times a little too attention-calling (the final set piece in the nuclear reactor comes to mind), and the physical effects, including make up for a particular nemesis, aren't bad.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is, as always, excellent in the role which gave him fame. He knows the character, and maybe that's why the film works more than it should considering its mediocre screenplay. Liev Schreiber is surprisingly good as Victor - the man's made a career playing more cerebral, less physical characters, but in here he proves he's really excellent at playing ruthless villains. Danny Huston doesn't exactly channel Brian Cox's ""version"" of Stryker, but he's good nevertheless. Taylor Kitsch is lame as Gambit, and Ryan Reynolds (who's actually really good) is wasted as Wade Wilson. Considering both their characters were some of the most anticipated by the fans, their limited screen time is a really bad move by the filmmakers.<br/><br/>I was really entertained by X-Men Origins: Wolverine, mainly because Hugh Jackman is so damned good at playing the titular character and because, although the action sequences were pretty ordinary, they looked awesome. Compared to some of the comic book films I mentioned earlier in this review, though, it's a pretty big disappointment. Considering everything that has been told in comic books about this character, much more could have been done with an origins motion picture, but the filmmakers decided to focus on action and violence... so there you go. The funny things is, director Gavin Hood is not an action director, so why bring him? And to think that I thought his presence could make the film focus more on character than on fights, explosions and CGI."
"johnnymacbest","3","19","41","4 May 2009"," Completely misses the mark on every level.
","Let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Wolverine and was just dying to see this film with high expectations. Well, after coming out of the theater, I stress wholeheartedly they should've been lowered to the lowest degree.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the film, Wolverine and Sabertooth get thirty minutes of character development and that's fine because they are my favorite Marvel characters which I thought everything would go smoothly from that point. But imagine my surprise when Gambit shows up on the scene and guess what: he's reduced to a freaking 4 MINUTE CAMEO!!! Gambit (who should've been in the first two films) along with EVERYONE ELSE gets reduced to second billing. I mean, this is SUPPOSED to be his movie, not some Marvel Superhero Reunion. Save that for the damn Avengers movie for crying out loud.<br/><br/>There are other things from the comics this film virtually ignores: The rivalry between Wolverine and Sabertooth, the inner workings of the Weapon X project, his relationship with Yuriko Oyama (known as Lady Deathstrike) and the nature of Wolverine's character. In the comics, Wolverine is very violent and berserk; here ""they"" sugarcoat his animal-like fury into a generic, uninteresting, carbon-copy Death Wish type that lacks any tension or suspense whatsoever. At least Sabertooth was the only character that's close to his comic book version. And I can never understand why the hell is CYCLOPS in this movie? In the comics, he never was involved with Wolverine until later on. Special effects and action are good but time and time again they STILL keep using the quick editing, shaky camera technique that's as clich√© in so many action movies it's not even funny; it's painful.<br/><br/>Overall this film had the potential to be another successful Marvel adaptation like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk released last year. Instead, it amounts to nothing more than a spectacle over substance with no cohesion or originality. Like so many brainless action films, this film completely misses the mark completely and judging by the film itself, was probably a victim of studio tampering.<br/><br/>Avoid like the plague.<br/><br/>X-Men 1 and 2 are MUCH better choices."

","A movie is good when there are parts of it that you desire to see over again. There must be touching moments, funny moments, action, deep thoughtful scenes or just plain ole lump in the throat cinematography. Iron Man had many scenes of action, dialogue, and informative set-up as to who and how Iron Man came to be.<br/><br/>Wolverine-Xmen Origins shined in the first 20 minutes, particularly with the montage of world wars Wolverine fought in. Also, the elite team of mutants that Wolverine fought with during the movies first half hour were a better story line and plot, as opposed to where they eventually segued with the script. I would have rather seen Wolverine and his X-Patriots take on rival and relevant comic-book favorites, than to have them formulaicly turn on each other.<br/><br/>It was a modern day Cain and Able! Wolverine and Saber-tooth, battling over who has the best looking press-on nails in scene after scene of scratching and clawing which left us scratching our heads in the end. These Battling Blade Brother's feud never made much sense to the audience and the origin of their Ginsu gripe with each other became so shuffled that even Gambit couldn't deal with it! Hugh Jackman(Wolverine) was voted one of the Sexiest Men Alive, and I have to suspect that the Marvel Movie Machine knew just where to oil and lubricate the screeching lust of female fans, making their gears and pulleys turn for this Box Office Boytoy.<br/><br/>It is fine to have a great looking star in a movie, but in days of old, handsome leading men, accompanied a leading script. And please keep in mind that a good script, a good premise and care for telling a good story is what the audience desires more than anything. Tony Soprano(James Gandolfini) wasn't trim and muscled, yet his character and the story was so well developed that we loved the ride.<br/><br/>There are movies that we can watch over and over again: Goodfellows, Ironman, Scarface, Godfather, Back To The Future, etc....because they are filled with memorable moments that we like to see and hear.I can look at Iron over and over again. I would not care to sit through Wolverine: Xmen Origins again.<br/><br/>Here is my message to the folks at Marvel and the studios and Producers. Make us a memorable movie Marvel! Wolverine: Xmen Origins is nothing more than the capitalization and commercialization of a The Sexiest Man Alive! It is a disappointment to movie goers who pay to see big screen dialogue, scenery, scripts, action and an engaging story.<br/><br/>Just from the long anticipated debut of this movie, you will make plenty at the Box Office, and I suspect that that is all you really aimed for.

","Okay... I'm going to TRY to do this. *Deep breath*<br/><br/>Wolverine is, by far, one of the most popular and iconic characters in Marvel. He is one of my favorite, and the mythos about him has been batted back and forth so much, you can pretty much pick and choose what you put in a particular origin story. As for X-Men Origins: Wolverine's origin story, the first hour or so of this movie actually was going well. Maybe a little more than an hour. That's when my clich√©' alarm started to ring.<br/><br/>Because soon after giving Wolverine his Adamantium skeleton (from Colonel 'Let's stick Adamantium in it and call it a day' Striker) the movie suddenly starts tumbling down a hill of pointless plot twists, gratuitous Marvel Character cameos (Not that it wasn't gratuitous before) that makes X-Men: Evolution look like a finely crafted epic poem. I don't care that it's not in comic book continuity, or they screwed up little details. That doesn't bother me. It didn't bother me in the original X-Men movies, and it doesn't bother me now. What does bother me is the way the movie both races towards the finish line, and unnecessarily draws the plot out. It's like listening to ten year olds play with action figures. No, actually, it's more like watching a bad video game that SOMEONE ELSE is playing, complete with a boss fight at the end! That's right, a boss fight. For all you nerds that haven't seen it, in the end, Wolvering fights Deadpool. But not the real Deadpool, the teleporting, eye-blasting, adamantium-infused, pseudo-mutant Deadpool with no mouth. The only good point of that character is sewn shut before it begins. Brilliant, thanks a bunch for that boss fight. You can play as either Wolverine or Sabertooth, who isn't Sabertooth, but is. And his love interest is dead, only she isn't, it was all a trick, so she can come back at the end to... what, keep Logan's interest? Get him ticked off? Stop him from killing his brother? None of that appeals to me, he should kill the bastard completing the Cain and Abel parallel. Or is that too deep for you?<br/><br/>There's a desperate feeling in this movie to make a very R-rated character very PG-13, but I'm not on board with that. My feeling is if you're telling a story about a guy who goes ballistic with knives sticking out of his hand, there'd better be some limbs chopped off, and I want to see every gory second.<br/><br/>This was a movie written by a committee looking up Marvel Characters in Wikipedia and hammering out a script over the weekend. Then at the end they forgot 'Oh yeah, Logan's got amnesia, we need a plot device to explain that' and decided not to go with the quadrillions of Marvel Characters than can erase memories, and shot him with an Adamantium bullet. I wish I was making this up. Wait, no I don't, because it's retarded. There's a brief Patrick Stewart cameo in there for no reason other than yet another gratuitous 'Hey, nerds, look at this' moment. Also, why did they advertise the woman with diamond skin as the White Queen? More pointless name dropping? I'm genuinely surprised there isn't a slew of action figures and 'Wolverine cereal with little marshmallow Deadpools' to round out this fustercluck of marketing and nerditude. If you paid to see this, get half your money back. If you didn't, bravo. Neither did I."

Not only have the producers pried $8 from my wallet by the premise of expanding our understanding of Wolverine, but they wasted Jackman in nonsense drivel that besmirches the Marvel Comics canon.<br/><br/>And for that, the responsibility rests solely with writers David Benioff and Skip Woods. This film should have been character driven, with slices of Wolverine's life subtly shaping the mutant he became. In fact, the advertising suggested this is the film's raison d'etre. Instead, what hit my theater was a series of action set pieces ""loosely"" (being generous) connected by neck snapping plot twists.<br/><br/>I got the feeling the writers sat down with a a six pack of Icehouse Beer and a bucket. In the bucket they tossed slips of paper with the ideas for scenes that would make a really cool trailer. And then they laid them out in a line and came up with ideas to connect them. I mean, memory erasing bullet? How else do you explain that? <br/><br/>2 writers with 5 movies between them, and except for Wood's ""Hit-man"" they all lost money. (Frankly, find Hit-man's estimated budget of $24M hard to believe). Who in Hollywood green-lighted a $130M for two guys that can't tell a story?

But for me the real star was Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth. He was exceptional and is one of the reasons why you should see this film. I did not have a doubt in mind that he could pull it off, especially after his performance Defiance, where he had noticeably gained a few pounds in preparation for this role. I was particularly surprised with Taylor Kitsch portrayal as Gambit. He did a great job, but because of how young he looked, it made me wonder what year or decade the actual story took place.

The movie goes for a slick look and aptly combines that with lots of violence and usually the intention of these means is to make something look sophisticated - which does not work when one has seen all the script's scenes done better in other stories before.<br/><br/>Lots of things are left unexplained (Logan and Victor's immortality, Logan's other mutant skills, when he stopped going by his given name and adopted Logan in the first place, how long the film's world has known of mutants), unexplained and potentially illogical (why this or that hurts or kills someone (or doesn't, for that matter)), or simply utterly un-called for (the infantile boxing match scene).<br/><br/>You'd also question the characters' intelligence at times: Logan apparently never bothered to ask what exactly his make-over halfway through the movie entailed and how this one secret facility could exist for years with hardly any guards and someone so dumb in charge you're left to wonder (memo: don't create an indestructible weapon if you have no means to control it).<br/><br/>Finally, there's this whole theme about Logan quarreling with the idea that he's a brutal animal, only his complex makes no sense when the first minutes of the movie established him as nothing but a soldier who looked awfully pained at his brother's bloodlust and tried to stop it.<br/><br/>I would like to say something conciliatory, though: Hugh Jackman. Butt naked."

","I've been a big fan of Wolverine since I was a kid watching the cartoon they had in the 90s. X1 and 2 were pretty decent films but the third one failed on so many levels, I was really hoping Hollywood might get its head together and deliver an excellent film revealing the origins of one of my favorite super-heroes. But alas, Origins fails even worse than X3 did.<br/><br/>Jackman is an okay actor and he isn't terrible in the film but the plot is a train-wreck. We are introduced to a bunch of different characters, some of which are later killed off only to come back to life, others betray Logan for no real reason..It was impossible to care about any of the characters when we got to see them for a only a few minutes, heck, somehow the filmmakers even made it hard to care about Logan... In the midst of the chaos of resurrected characters and plans for revenge things are lost, like any motivation for Wolverine to do many of the things he does and even simple plot details like what year it is...<br/><br/>This isn't a competent super-hero film, its not even a competent action film. A few of the fights are alright, and the special effects are pretty good, but that's all it is, a lot of fluff and no real(or good/well put together) story. Makes me long for the 90s Cartoon, I seem to vaguely recall a better handling of Logan's origin in that.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Wolverine from the comics or cartoons I suggest you avoid this if at all possible... Also, any die-hard Gambit or Deadpool fans might want to steer clear as well"

","X-men origins Wolverine is an America Science fiction movie based on a character (Wolverine) of Marvel Comics. This movie tells the story of Wolverine's life and how he turned into a mutant. Logan (Wolverine) takes part of one group of murderers. He found out that group is a sham to find one meteorite (adamantium/indestructible metal) and he rebels against the group when they start killing innocent people. During little time Logan lived with one woman as a normal man. This woman is supposedly killed by his brother. Logan goes in search of revenge and finds the leader of the group of murderers that proposed to inject adamantium in his body. Now with adamantium in his body Logan goes again in search of his brother and when he finds him, Logan realize that the woman is a mutant and that she's not dead. The woman follows the man who wants to kill Logan, but gets shot in the head and loses his memory. The woman dies. Finally Logan without memory goes away."

","Action is never too much if there's a buildup & thats what this movie provides just that @ every turn. Even though I knew what would happen usually, the dialogue was better than expected. Visuals have already been praised & i don't need 2 go into how great every jolt is. Revenge it seems is the basis for last big action movies & idk if thats a reflection o the people wanting 2 take back our country but I have a sense it is. Hugh Jackman wants his normal life back & does everything he can to keep his mutant life & friends behind. He wants peace & little to do with the nagging government. Only negative is the little use of Jackmans wife, though you still got 2 see her sincerity when you didn't expect it. Love that movie didn't really neel 2 much on character development but we still saw Wolverines simple life slip away. All in all, good cameo with Patrick Stewart just when they need him. Personally, id say it was Jackmans best X-Men movie."

","I saw the film yesterday and am still feeling that dull ache of disappointment. I am not concerned with any lack in staying true to the character/history etc, as really I just wanted to see something enjoyable, to really be swept up in what was on the screen.<br/><br/>Alas, I was not so swept away with what I saw. I haven't seen the bootleg copy, but I feel the finished product was closer to an unfinished edit than should have been released. I felt the effects were unconvincing and very hit-and-miss, dare I say even sloppy in places? The product just didn't feel well executed from a production standpoint. Then again maybe we have been spoiled with the likes of Watchmen/Dark Knight etc. which have had a very strong aesthetic. This dynamic approach to the aesthetic of the film was lacking in X Men Origins. A Crime when your source material is as visual as the comic/graphic novel format. A real pity as this needed style to bring the beast to life. It will remain on life support I guess until the possibility of a sequel is mooted. Lets just hope the next person who gets the helm has the vision and bravery to play to the aesthetic, and bring back the magic of Weapon X."

","This movie was not good. I don't know why, maybe its cause wolverine is one of my favorite characters and this movie is made for 12 year olds.<br/><br/>The plot was messy, the final climax made no sense, the characters were poorly used, poorly casted and unnecessary (Gambit, Blot, Beak and William's character). Throughout the whole movie it felt like I was watching a video game, travel this level, beat this boss, next stage, travel a bit, beat this boss, next stage, travel around a bit, etc.<br/><br/>I do commend Liev for his portrayal of Sabertooth, which was very good and a fresh feel to the character, which is not only animalistic in nature but also intelligent. Jackson was good as always as wolverine, this is his character.<br/><br/>I would recommend this as a rental or a cheap matin√©e, definitely not worth full price."

","After three hugely successful films, Marvel's X-Men franchise returns with a prequel of sorts for arguably the series' most popular character: Wolverine.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman once again dons the claws and sideburns to become Logan, a mutant with the ability to heal from any wound. It's this power that brings him and his brother Victor (also a mutant, but with more cat-like features and agility) to the attention of US government agent William Stryker, who is putting together a special forces team of people with abilities to carry out dangerous missions. After spending years with this group, Logan decides he's had enough and leaves to start a normal life. But that is soon interrupted when Stryker reappears to warn him of a new danger. Motivated by revenge, Logan volunteers to take part in the Weapon X program, where his bones are surgically enhanced with an indestructible metal. But once the truth about the program is revealed, Logan finds himself pitted against some of his former colleagues, including his own brother.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine combines tons of action with good doses of drama and lite humor to make one of the more enjoyable X-Men films to date. Hugh Jackman turns in another great performance as the title character and Liev Schreiber's turn as Victor AKA Sabretooth is fantastic. He and Jackman have great chemistry and the scenes in which they appear on screen together are the highlights of the movie. The main flaw of the film is the use of supporting characters, especially Gambit. He just feels out of place in the story, as if the filmmakers included him merely to please the comic book fan-boy crowd. Plus the actor portraying Gambit, Taylor Kitsch, doesn't even bother speaking in the Cajun accent his character is famous for.<br/><br/>All in all, despite some character issues, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is an entertaining entry to the growing franchise and a step up from 2006's messy X-Men: The Last Stand."
"uwa","2","20","46","22 April 2009"," disappointing
","after watching this movie, you can easily say that, the story about logan's past better stayed untold. through out the movie you can feel that both the screen play writers and the director struggle to handle the story. characters are one dimensional, the relationship between the characters are unclear and non motivated which made some actions done by the cast seems unnecessary or unrealistic. all the other things a side, i was still waiting for an action filled ending which i thought can't go wrong however even though some scenes were impressive and brother bonding was fun to watch, the last scene was so weak that makes you want to forget it right away. i have to say that, Stryker, risking his life to erase logan's memory was one of the weakest ending to an any comic adaptation.<br/><br/>i think they will make a sequel for wolverine and i hope they try to keep it more simple, if they had just focused on wolverine and sabertooth's rivalry it would be more intense, memorable and realistic. that doesn't mean i don't want to see the other characters too, but in a movie about wolverine they don't need the x-men style of story telling.."

","Okay, I must say it is NOT the best X-men movie ever.<br/><br/>However I did enjoy most of the movie, being there with a couple of friends. We had a few laughs, the humor of it all was good.

As rumors go that there is going to be a part two... maybe they didn't tell the entire story just yet? I do hope so.<br/><br/>I think that despite it being a Wolverine focus some of the other mutants such as Gambit could have used some more work or even focus time.<br/><br/>I think what mostly did it for me was that I could just watch, put my mind at zero, not thinking about what should be, but how they did it and just simply enjoy it.<br/><br/>I'd say if you like Wolverine and just want to simply enjoy, go for it. If you are a hardcore fan of the comics though, then really I don't think you should be going. Marvel, I hope that you'll make the 2nd part and give more of the Wolverine we fans adore."

"dfranzen70","5","3","4","3 December 2009"," Idiotic, but things do blow up
","Despite the great efforts of Hugh Jackman, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is dead on arrival, combining an illogical plot with a raft of clich√©s that would embarrass the worst porn writer ever. There are too many characters to keep track of, and the action seems to be intentionally frantic, the better to distract you from the fact that little of the story makes a whit of sense.<br/><br/>We get to see the actual origins of Wolverine (that is, as a young child) when he discovers that the man he just killed with his bare, uh, claws was his real dad and that the guy he thought was just a good pal is actually his brother Victor, aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). Later we see Wolverine (known then as Logan) and Sabretooth fighting in four different American wars (Civil, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam), and then he and his brother are eventually brought in as part of a mutant team called Weapon X by a sinister military guy, Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston). The mutants proceed to kick everyone's ass until Wolverine has a bout with decency and quits.<br/><br/>Fast forward six years later and Wolverine's living a placid life as a lumberjack in Canada with his hot girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox, and Stryker finds him and tells him someone's picking off the old team members (oh no!). Can Wolverine help? Who's responsible for these deaths? I bet Stryker knows more than he's telling. He's sinister, you know.<br/><br/>If I had to sum up this movie's plot in one word, it'd be ""revenge."" Wolverine is constantly avenging someone or something. Sometimes he's just mad in general, but usually he's going after Sabretooth for something or going after Stryker for something or going after unnamed goons in helicopters and tanks for something. Another recurring motif is Wolverine's angst. The guy's like 140 years old, but he has the angst of a cuckolded teenager on prom night. At least twice he looks up to the heavens, arms spread, crying ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!"" Yes, in this day and age of highfalutin gizmodery we still have mopey superheroes.<br/><br/>The movie tries so damn hard to be loved that it forgets it's supposed to be sort of a superhero comic-book movie. There's endless backstory about the two brothers, and it feels like it's shoehorned in, almost as if the makers thought they had to explain themselves. Is it important to know that Wolverine's dad was a gardener? Probably not. Did he have to visit so many of the former members of Weapon X? I'm gonna say no.<br/><br/>Even so, the final villain ‚Äì Deadpool, who has all the strengths of the other mutants on the team and none of their weaknesses ‚Äì is pretty damn scary and convincing. Trouble is, they make him so tough to kill that it's difficult to get closure on him. If you know what I mean. I mean, he has all of the strengths of these superhuman dudes without having those namby-pamby weaknesses! What's the point? At least the setting's appropriate for this movie: Three Mile Island, which for you youngsters out there we should note was the scene of a major nuclear-power-plant accident in 1979, which might be when this movie's denouement is set.<br/><br/>Anyway, because there's so much exposition, there's little room for character ‚Äì either character development or an actual character OF the film. It's bland, the porridge of comic-book movies. There's no cleverness, no wit, nothing more than snide asides and bon mots, as if we were in a faceless Stallone movie circa 1984. Jackman's game, of course, but he's now played Wolverine in four movies, so this wasn't exactly a stretch for him. I'd like to think that this clunker will put to rest any plans for future Origins installments, but I got a feeling we'll be seeing Magneto and Storm get their tales told someday as well."
"NoArrow","7","3","4","5 August 2009"," A joke, but a good one
","Here's a movie that deserved every criticism it got, and is still pretty good. Yes, the script is horrible, and the story worse. Yes, the characters do things that make no sense just to push the movie along. No, it's certainly not a movie that does any justice to its titular character. But it's still kind of fun.<br/><br/>Let me explain. You take three issues of any comic book, read them in order, a lot of the time, it's not gonna make much sense. But the word bubbles are so small, the pictures are so big, you don't really care. The characters do some crazy things, and it looks good. That's this movie all over. It starts with Wolverine, hero of the ""X-Men"" trilogy, as a child in pre-Canada Canada. He and his older brother go through some incomprehensible family trouble; Wolverine sprouts his bone claws, shouts ""NO!"" up into the air and the opening credits montage starts. That's what kind of movie this is.<br/><br/>Wolvie and his brother grow up, his brother becomes Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), and they fight through every major American war together, simply to do it I guess. Maybe the film's director, the artistically higher-minded Gavin Hood, wanted to portray Wolvie and his brother as salt of the Earth, regular Men-type characters. It works good enough I guess, but all we get is a couple neutered fight scenes and a lot of snarling for the camera. They come off more like figures in the opening sequence of a video game, where you're waiting for the game to start.<br/><br/>So Wolvie and Creed join this covert group of mutant spies/soldiers, one of them is Ryan Reynolds, one of them is Will.i.am, they each have powers, and so on. They go to another country and we get some impossible (but still aesthetically-pleasing) action scenes where some of them get to demonstrate their powers. Something happens, they get split up. Wolvie ends up living with a schoolteacher who is strangely good at ""persuasion"" (a bizarre attempt at subtle foreshadowing in a movie about people with superhuman powers).<br/><br/>The woman, her character, is the glue that ties the whole movie together and the underlying joke beneath everything. She's given a couple lines in the beginning to create some sort of totally misguided Native American mystical past for her, but all we're thinking is, ""Who is she, and why is she in the movie?"" Wolvie's in love with her, or at least acts like he is, which is to say Hugh Jackman tries his best to act like he is, but there's absolutely nothing there and everyone seems to know it. She's a shameless, walking Plot Device, and the final bit of fate dealt to her character, and Jackman's final moment with her, is like a hilarious punchline to the idiocy of the whole story.<br/><br/>Everything else has Wolvie running around, sprouting his claws, meeting some semi-to-actually-kinda-interesting characters like Blob and Gambit, and running in slow motion to do battle with his brother, Creed. Schreiber plays this role with real commitment and gusto, and an apparent lack of interest in how he looks. He comes off so crazy and ruthless he achieves that insane cartoon level of acting you see sometimes from Johnny Depp or, say, Danny DeVito in ""Batman Returns."" This movie really made me like Schreiber; I want him to take more roles like this one in the future.<br/><br/>Listen, it's not great. But it is funny ‚Äì be that intentionally or not ‚Äì and it has some beautiful action scenes, particularly one atop a giant smoke stack at the end. They're not beautiful in concept or execution, just in the childish innocence of it all. See it once, or a couple times, for a few laughs.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I want to start by saying I am a big fan of X-men and I did have high hopes. But this movie was a mess. I don't really know where to start so I guess I will start with the good.<br/><br/>Good: Hugh Jackman<br/><br/>Bad: About everything else<br/><br/>OK, OK so I am being a little harsh. It wasn't all bad. Liev Schreiber was believable as Victor/Sabertooth and Will.i.am was actually pretty good as Spectre. I am going to break it down for you so you can see what I based my review on.<br/><br/>-Story-<br/><br/>I have read the book Weapon X and all the comics detailing the history of Logan. This movie does a poor job or telling us anything we either didn't know or didn't care to know. It was written badly (screaming in the air out of rage, sadness, anger more than once? Really?) The plethora of other Wolverine history books and comics do a much better job of telling us his history. Probably one of the worst parts of the whole movie was how it was ""explained"" how Logan got the name Wolverine (All I am going to say is Koo-Koo-Kachoo).<br/><br/>-Acting-<br/><br/>This was most likely the highlight of the movie. Hugh Jackman as always was great as Wolverine. As I stated before Liev Schreiber was a good Sabertooth and Will.I.Am was surprising good as Spectre. Lastly Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool was just what you would expect, funny and likable. They had other mutants thrown in to lure Xmen fans in. Don't fall for it! Logans team also includes Agent Zero, Bolt, and the Blob all of which or more or less useless in this movie (The Blob less useless than the other 2). They don't need to be in the movie, and they are acted like they didn't care to be in the movie. Now don't even get me started on Remy LeBeau also know as Gambit. **Spoiler** He is in the movie for all of 8 minutes **End Spoiler**. He doesn't talk with a french accent (I think Taylor Kitsch tried, I really do but he failed. He failed badly) or do a whole lot else that screams Gambit. He does throw cards and has his staff but other than that, nothing.<br/><br/>-Effects-<br/><br/>One word.......horrible (for the most part).<br/><br/>Wolverine's claws look like dollar store tinfoil. They do not look anywhere near as good as his claws from X1, 2, or 3. They moved around when his hands were stationary, and shifted their location from between his fingers to partway down his hand. The driving scenes were laughable, they just look bad. If you have ever seen an 80's TV show where they were just starting to use green screens then you know how it will look. Any flying scenes reminded me of Microsoft Flight Sim 97', thats all I will say. **Spoiler** Deadpool at the end aggravated me, they really should not have messed up his character with all the powers they gave him. Did he really need to shoot energy from his eyes like Cyclops. No, no he didn't. His power just weren't executed well. **End Spoiler** I could keep rambling on about the bad effect but I am going to give the credit to where some good credit is due. The only effects I did like were Spectre's teleporting, and the Blobs stomach jiggled in a very believable way.<br/><br/>Finally... -Sound/Music-<br/><br/>Sound effects were OK, I mean you can really improve the ""snikt"" sound of Wolverine's claws. Gun fire and explosions sound the same as any other action movie. None of the music really stood out but it did help the movie progress.<br/><br/>-All in All-<br/><br/>If you are going to see the movie either way, then go in with your expectations low. The only saving grace is some of the acting."

","'We're going to make you indestructible - but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.' Gavin Hood directs this 2009 cinematic version of the origins (read 'explanation') or the X-Men series of comic book heroes based on a screenplay by David Benioff ('Game of Thrones' etc) and Skip Woods ('Hitman', 'Swordfish', 'The A Team' etc). The team manages to pull of the credibility-testing feat with aplomb ‚Äì just the right amount of humanistic emphasis on the early ears of Wolverine and a flair for the impossible feats and countless deaths of the latter half of this film. It is a look at Wolverine's early life, in particular his time with the government squad Team X and the impact it will have on his later years.<br/><br/>Leading up to the events of X-Men, X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program. Two mutant brothers, Logan (Hugh Jackman) who will become Wolverine of the retractable claws and Victor (Liev Schreiber), born 200 years ago, suffer childhood trauma and have only each other to depend on. Basically, they're fighters and killers, living from war to war through U.S. history. In modern times, a U.S. colonel, Stryker (Danny Huston), recruits them and other mutants as commandos. Logan quits and becomes a logger, falling in love with a local teacher (Lynn Collins). When Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker's crew, the colonel sends the murderous Victor. Logan now wants revenge. Along the way, Wolverine encounters many mutants, both familiar and new, including surprise appearances by several legends of the X-Men universe (Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney, et al) whose appearances in the film series have long been anticipated.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is sensitive and humanistic (Ryan Reynolds manages to insert his expected spot-on one liners to keep the story light) ‚Äì the second half is pure CGI tricks (though according to the featurettes Hugh Jackman performed all his own choreographic fights).

"StevePulaski","8","4","6","19 May 2014"," An origin-story, an action spectacle, and a critique of age-old philosophy
","I'm not sure mainstream audiences realize how massive the X-Men library of characters really is. I am informed by my close friends, many of whom are enthusiasts in early comic books, that the X-Men character roster stretches a mile wide and one cannot watch a few films of the X-Men franchise and expect to know all the characters of the series, let alone a select few in great detail.<br/><br/>It is precisely this reason why I feel that the idea of an X-Men Origins series being made is not such a bad idea, although with the middling reception and box office returns that Wolverine managed to recoup, I feel the studios are thinking differently. The X-Men film franchise has a sizable job of introducing a variety of new characters and villains along with giving them some sort of identification past their superpowers and throwing a conflict at them that they need to solve (or attempt to, at least) in the course of a film. Just the latter obligation is so heavy that it distracts from the other two points. Giving several X-Men characters their own film showing their beginnings and their development on a more personal basis would allow for more character resonation and depth, but also allow the films to spend more time developing stories and villains rather than trying to cram (or completely disregard) the film's core heroes last minute.<br/><br/>Gavin Hood's X-Men Origins: Wolverine has a few missteps in terms of CGI, but on a story basis, it is wholly interesting and easy to sink into. Opening in 1845, it tells the story of Wolverine's beginnings as James Howlett, a young boy who sees his father killed right before his eyes. These combined feelings of anger and sadness that wash over him activate his mutation of having long, metal claws that extend out of his knuckles, killing the man who killed his father only to realize that the man he killed was his father.<br/><br/>James flees his home with the man's son Victor Creed who grows up to be Liev Schreiber, while James grows up to be Hugh Jackman. The two wind up being dedicated soldiers for the next century, fighting in the American Civil War, both World War I and II, and the Vietnam War, before killing their senior officer and being sentenced to death, which they both survive. Together, they are approached by William Stryker (Danny Huston) to work for Team X, a mutant organization, to which they both accept before James leaves after six years being disillusioned with the entire process.<br/><br/>To go on ruins the fun of watching Wolverine's life unfold, which is interesting in itself. Jackman has gone from embodying the aura of Wolverine to quickly becoming the character, portraying him in many different lights, from emotional, to strong-willed, to violent, to uncontrollable, to vulnerable, and so forth. Jackman is assisted here by Schreiber, who manages to work with him to create an entertaining partnership that is less about buddy-buddy charisma but more about two men stuck together and bound by what seems to be a curse.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine lacks the clear love and affection for the material that director Bryan Singer delivered, along with being burdened by some poor CGI/green-screen work here and there, but the film is also missing the downright awful dialog that was present in X-Men: The Last Stand. Writers David Benioff (who wrote Troy and went on to write several episodes for HBO's breakout hit Game of Thrones) and Skip Woods forgo the abundance of useless one-liners for drama, and director Gavin Hood changes pace from directing South African dramas (including the incredible Tsotsi) to a film that allegedly has more depth than one initially would think.<br/><br/>Hood comments on X-Men Origins: Wolverine's possible political side by saying, ""Any movie that is simply about good versus evil...is in my view putting out into the world and certainly into a mass audience and young audience's mind a rather dangerous philosophy, which is that there is good and evil in the simplistic and easily defined way. I think that for the last eight years, we've had that philosophy very much prevalent in the Bush administration that if you're on the side of good, at least as you perceive it, then you can do no evil. That's what's so great about this character or about this movie for me and why I wanted to do it. This is a guy who recognizes his own capacity for evil and I think that's exciting in a sort of popular culture kind of way."" Because Hood recognizes Wolverine's deeper side and delivers it in a way that is critiquing of age-old philosophy, we get a film that subsequently gives us a more enriching endeavor than your average superhero film.<br/><br/>Starring: Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Dominic Monaghan, and Ryan Reynolds. Directed by: Gavin Hood."

It is filled with action, twists and turns, and surprisingly adequate storytelling as well. It is a tad vague with how it is done, but it does just enough to keep you satisfied. I thought it did a good job of telling the story of how Wolverine came to be. There are some great fight scenes, especially with Wolverine & Victor. Deadpool is pretty rad himself. Wait until you see him as Stryker's ultimate mutant with everybody's power. Reynolds was supposed to get a spin-off film in Deadpool, but it didn't happen for some reason, which is a shame. The twist at the end was something I wasn't expecting the first time I watch it, and I was actually floored by it. I'm not sure everybody will find it unpredictable, but it caught me off guard the first time I saw it. I do wish the old couple that take Logan in stayed around for a bit, I would have liked to see that developed a little more. The acting is pretty good. Hugh Jackman is excellent as Wolverine. I loved his rage and frustration in this one. His chemistry with Liev Schreiber was on the money. Their storyline together made for riveting entertainment. Schreiber is awesome as the intense brother. This is a man I wouldn't screw around with. Danny Huston is very solid as Stryker, but I prefer Brian Cox in the role. Not to say I didn't enjoy Huston in the role, because I most certainly did. He was great. Lynn Collins is great as the love interest of Logan's. Their love storyline felt real and natural. Taylor Kitsch isn't a favorite of mine, but he fits Gambit like a glove. I thoroughly enjoyed him. Ryan Reynolds screen time is tragically short, but I loved his wise-cracking portrayal of Wade. The rest of the cast does fine work as well. I questioned Scott Summers role at first, but once I saw the ending, it changed my perception. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I wanted to see this again before checking out the new Wolverine film. This never fails to entertain me when I watch it. It has a little bit of everything for action fans. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>P.S, stay for the end credits!"

","Honestly, this was a pretty amazing movie. But seeing a whole new group of X-Men movies gets everyone so excited. We see 'X-Men Origins' and it brings up a whole truck load of hope for what could come! I think that if there are no other movies in this series it'll be an extreme disappointment for all X-Men fans -and there's a lot of us. What would be intriguing would be to find out about Mystique. She's an interesting character and her origins story would pull everyone in. I hope that the X- men will not end. Just don't change any main character actors.<br/><br/>I do love the way they chose to display Jimmy's age -showing them fighting one war after the other. However, it's extremely unclear, the fact that Victor Creed is Sabertooth. I was fully unaware until i researched the movie after watching it -this news came as quite a shock to me. It should have been made more obvious. Like in an end scene showing Victor running off into the building or the water or something of the sort -like an animal, of course-, just to plant the idea that he's angry and vengeful and increasingly animalistic. Also, how is it that years later, when Scott (Cyclops) grew up and joined the X-Men, he did not recognize Logan's voice at the very least when he joined them at the school?"

"oneguyrambling","6","4","6","30 October 2010"," Shiny noisy and pointless. The Paris Hilton of films.
","WOW! A film about a character out of the three X-Men movies, none of which I cared for, how can I pass that up?<br/><br/>Another example of the American hard-on for prequels, Wolverine jumps straight into the action with young Wolvie killing his pop after discovering his new talent, and he and his brother run off, never to return. <br/><br/>(I remember when I was Wolvie's age, hair was growing in various new and exciting places - especially my sideburns! - my hair grew naturally into all sorts of weird gravity defying configurations, and hardened steel grew out of my hands, it is a beautiful time when you are 12 years old.)<br/><br/>Hugh and Liev Schreiber at least throw themselves into the action with the early goings on, turns out that in 1845 they were both young kids and as they grew up over the next 150 years they decided to do what they were best suited, and fight in any and every war over the period. <br/><br/>In one of the latter battles they are approached to join a newly created group of mercenaries, kind of a special ops sort of deal with a bunch of similarly gifted men, (read: mutants). <br/><br/>The unit is lead by Stryker, and Logan and Victor, as the boys are still known at this time are initially in their element. However after a time they are given orders that go beyond your ordinary garden variety ""soldiering"" and Logan objects, to the point that he leaves the unit, Victor decides that this is the life for me and stays on.<br/><br/>It is obvious that the guys in the unit are the guys that we will be spending the rest of the film with, and it was at this point in the film that I became very concerned with how the next 70 minutes would progress. We have members of the all 2000s B-Team: Ryan Reynolds, Dominic Monaghan and Will.I.Am. <br/><br/>Let me just say when you stock your cast with three guys of that calibre, you are aiming too low, and yes I am aware that one of them was a hobbit at one time. <br/><br/>I was never going into Wolverine expecting ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Iron Man"", but putting pretty boys and not character actors in these roles gives me the impression that the film-makers are more worried with name recognition than they are their product. <br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds further ruined the (already ordinary) Blade:Trinity, and hasn't made a single thing of substance in a mediocre career. Will.I.Am cannot act and Dominic Monaghan's career hasn't soared since LOTR, though personally I blame the talking trees.<br/><br/>So where were we? Oh yeah, I guess what I am saying is that Hugh Jackman is a good looking boy, with a fairly formidable physique in this film. After he decides he disagrees with the unit's genocide policy and leaves we move to 6 Years Later mode. <br/><br/>Logan is now working hard for his cash as you would expect, and has shacked up with a chick who looks like the offspring of Renee Zelleweger and Catherine Keener, and if that is even possible I want an immediate stop to all genetic engineering, as it was badly misused in this case.<br/><br/>It becomes evident to us (in a scene where Dominic Monaghan just straight-out slaughters an American accent) that someone is hunting down former members of the unit, and Stryker visits Logan and his laydee to warn them. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Logan ignores the warning and (backhanded) offers of help, and finds the crumpled body of his girly. In the defense of the killer, a few minutes previous she gave Logan a crappy ""moon spirit world"" story that had me hoping she would die. For that alone Hugh Jackman gets my nomination as Best Actor, as any guy knows how hard it is to appear interested when their partner recounts a dream or spreads a 2 minute anecdote into a four hour saga.<br/><br/>So Wolvie is understandably p****d and goes back to Stryker to get souped up, in a scene designed specifically to enable Jackman to Rooooaaaaarrrrr out of the water, which admittedly does look pretty cool. <br/><br/>Once again Jackman is the handsome loner and decides he'd rather go it alone, and after a brief respite to find a leather jacket and a motorcycle the final half an hour is a snail trail of chase scenes and fight scenes, with only pause for the introduction of some new characters who were ""so cool"" I have already forgotten them.<br/><br/>The one scene I did like - 99% thanks to CGI - was a motorcycle chase which features a pretty literal source to the term ""handbraking"". The finale occurs on ""The Island of Dr Stryker"", where the Doc has amassed an impressive collection of mutants in handy cages, including a guy with laser rays that come from his eyes who never thinks to use them on the bars.<br/><br/>In keeping with the glossy, shiny, just-do-enough adequacy policy that describes most Hollywood tripe, X-Men blah blah blah is OK without wowing anyone older than 12, there ain't much to it. <br/><br/>To those who say it could have been worse, I say that perhaps you should reevaluate your standards and aim higher. There are enough good movies out there that you shouldn't have to watch stuff like this. <br/><br/>Final Rating ‚Äì 6.5 / 10. Like plastic flowers this looks pretty, but ultimately it is shiny, pointless and forgotten in 2 weeks.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com"
"TheUnseenMovieLover","6","4","6","15 November 2009"," An Entertaining, If Not Brilliant, Comic Book Flick
","As I was walking into the cinema to watch ""X-Men: Origins-Wolverine"", I wasn't sure what I was going to make of it. Although the initial reviews for the movie had been good, negative reviews had soon started pouring through the floodgates. However, everyone at my college who had seen it was raving about it, some even going as far as calling it the best film in the ""X-Men"" series. So my vote could have gone either way.<br/><br/>As it turns out, I'm in the middle on this one. Thankfully, ""Wolverine"" is an enjoyable film, and far from the disaster that many critics have labelled it. However, apart from a few moments, it lacks the cinematic verve to boost it up to the high level of other comic book movies such as ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"". If you asked me to compare it to the other X-Men movies, I would say that it was on the same level as X-Men 3 (yes, I liked X3), but below X-Men 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Before I dive into the main review, here's a summary of the film's plot. After a domestic incident, brothers Logan and Victor flee their home. Both have mutant abilities which allow them to live forever and recover from nearly all wounds (also, Wolverine has bone claws which pop out of his knuckles and Victor has sharp fingernails and fangs). After fighting in wars from the American Civil War to the Vietnam conflict, Logan (played as an adult by Hugh Jackman) and Victor (played as an adult by Live Schreiber) are approached by Major William Stryker (Danny Huston). Stryker has discovered the pair's mutant abilities, and offers them a place in his covert ops team. However, after witnessing some of the group's more vicious activities, Logan quits to live a life of peace and quiet in the Canadian Rockies with his girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). However, Stryker and an angry Victor aren't far behind, and when tragedy strikes, Logan wants payback¬Ö <br/><br/>""Wolverine"" has quite a few flaws, some bigger than others. Wade ""Deadpool"" Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), Remy ""Gambit"" Labeau (Taylor Kitsch) and Chris ""Bolt"" Bradley (Dominic Monaghan) are three examples of characters who are underused. Concerning Deadpool and Gambit, if you can't find a significant role for a fan favourite in one movie, wait until another movie where you can! Deadpool and Gambit suffer the same fate here that Venom suffered in Spider-Man 3. Time to learn, Hollywood. Also, the script is littered with plot holes. The plot point concerning adamantium bullets is an incredibly lazy way of linking ""Wolverine"" to the plot line of the original trilogy. The lack of originality in the story and some dodgy special effects are just two other things to criticise.<br/><br/>However, there is still a lot to like. As the big man himself, Hugh Jackman is top-notch. He not only captures the internal struggle between Logan/Wolverine's human and animalistic sides beautifully, but he also manages to capture some genuinely poignant moments in what is essentially a big, loud blockbuster movie. Liev Schreiber (who lit up the recent Holocaust drama, Defiance) is also great as Victor Creed. Schreiber is vicious without going over-the top, witty without being pretentious. Both Jackman and Schreiber are the glue that holds this film together. Probably the most successful aspect of the movie is the love-hate relationship between Wolverine and Creed, which somewhat reflects the duel between Batman and the Joker in The Dark Knight. As the scheming Stryker, Danny Huston delivers an intriguingly devious portrait of a villain who the audience will love to hate. Lynn Collins gives a memorably vulnerable yet sensual turn as Logan's romantic interest, and rapper Will.i.am is surprisingly good in his movie debut as teleporter John Wraith. As mercenary Wade Wilson, Ryan Reynolds seizes your attention for every moment that he's on the screen. He is perfectly deadpan, cool and has one moment which pretty much defines the ""giddy schoolboy"" term, when he takes on 12 guys with machine guns when he has just two swords. Taylor Kitsch is suitably charming and charismatic as the roguish Gambit, whilst Dominic Monaghan elicits a beautifully understated sadness as Chris Bradley, who is cruelly called a freak. Overall, ""Wolverine"" doesn't let the side down when it comes to above-the-call-of-duty acting in comic book movies.<br/><br/>In terms of action, Wolverine doesn't disappoint. All of the action sequences are exciting, with a thrilling chase sequence which involves Logan being pursued by jeeps and a helicopter a stand-out. Aside from a few slips, the visual effects are effective. The cinematography is wonderful (a portion of the movie was shot in New Zealand, which, as Lord of the Rings proved, is a beautiful landscape for movies), whilst Harry Gregson-Williams creates a solid musical score. The script also contains funny moments of wry humour (such as Logan coming to terms with his new, metal claws), some unexpected cameos from ""X-Men"" favourites and some subtle nods towards the events of the original trilogy (Logan's fear of flying etc).<br/><br/>And the final question that I have to ask myself is; is the direction good enough? I think that it is. Gavin Hood doesn't make his own mark on the material, but he still does a decent job at over-seeing this movie. Despite some moments where his talent shines through (such as the exquisitely crafted opening sequence which sees Logan and Creed battling their way through four major wars), Hood's direction is mostly workmanlike, but still good enough to ensure that the movie doesn't collapse completely.<br/><br/>So, X-Men: Origins-Wolverine is a well-made, terrifically acted movie. It's just a shame that its flaws drag the movie down, as the best moments show the potential for a movie which could have easily rivalled X2 for the title of the best film in the X-Men series. Still, it's a decent slice of comic book entertainment."

","Just saw the premiere in my hometown Arnhem (Netherlands) yesterday. Frankly I was a little worried about the early reviews, the leak and the fact that there was no press screening.....but I had a hell of a good time......with goosebumps.<br/><br/>What Worked?<br/><br/>Jackman, Jackman, Jackman..... The guy is an amazing actor and captures the essence of wolverine. This is his define moment.<br/><br/>Liev Schreiber was promising in the trailers and truly was great in his performance. <br/><br/>The Story. Even though it was sometimes a bit rushed (the part where Logan hides with the elderly couple) it really surprised me...in a good way. The way Logan and Victor grow up as brothers is really the essence of the story and also the inner conflict that Logan has...this IS the story.....the rest is just to fill up space....but later more on that.<br/><br/>Taylor Kitsch Great addition to the Marvel Universe and great casting. Even if it is a secondary character, he gets enough screen time to make a lasting impression....think of him as the way they handled Cyclops in the X-men movies. Let's not forget.....It's a Wolverine movie....not a Gambit movie. But nevertheless.....really good.<br/><br/>Action. Oh My......WOW.<br/><br/>What didn't work (so much)?<br/><br/>Deadpool I've never been a great fan of the character so basically I couldn't care less about the lack of screen time.....however that is also the reason that I really wouldn't have mind that an unknown character would play the part. So people.....get over it......IT'S A WOLVERINE MOVIE!<br/><br/>Some CGI Yes, there is some CGI that makes me wonder.....what if. For instance Agent Zero Jumping in to a freaking helicopter....not so good. There are a few of those moments.<br/><br/>Closing thoughts. I'm definitely seeing this one again. It's better than X3, maybe on the same level as X1....not so much as X2. The combination of action and humor is great. Basically it makes me wonder why so many people gave it a bad review. Everybody was enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>I don't care about politics, early leaks, lack of screen time of a side character, Mr. Rothman or killing a franchise.....Mr Jackman produces a great action flick and shows Wolverine like he never did before and hopefully will do again. They only REAL complaint I have is that I probably have to wait another 3 years before we will see Logan back in action against the Silver Samurai in Japan.<br/><br/>Rainman Out."
"WallyDee","2","19","44","29 April 2009"," Horrible Special Effects!!!
","The thing that bothered me the most about this movie was how horrible the special effects were, every time when we got to see Wolverine's claws, it was so damn obvious how CGI they were, I STILL CANT BELIEVE IT. They definitely didn't look this bad in any of the x-men movies!<br/><br/>Many of the characters felt misplaced in my opinion, for example WTF was Cyclops doing in this movie, it just didn't feel right. They f*cked up Deadpool so bad!! I just wanted to cry. The first time we got to see Gambit I was like, He's freakin cool!!!! And it looked like a good casting job to me, but when the movie continued he was actually pretty.........DUMB, after the scene with the cards he didn't feel like Gambit anymore!!!<br/><br/>Even though i expected a lot from this movie, i always had this feeling somewhere deep inside that it was going to disappoint a lot of people, and i think it did!<br/><br/>It surely disappointed me."
"Red_Flag","2","13","28","29 April 2009"," Talk about a Shaggy Dog story...
","Sharp claws, cheep cigars, cheesy one liners? Have I seen this movie before? Thought so! Its round four for the X-Men and with the mutant franchise over it's about time we check the personal files on our protagonists with ""X-Men Origins"" This origin story tells the tale of Wolverine, the most prominent of the X-Men, and also the one that headlines all three of the previous film. Which brings up the films biggest flaw. Relevance. The problem is that Wolverine is a character that, in layman's terms had been done to death. A fourth film in which he headlines is abnoxsiouse, repetitive and insanely dull. The only pleasure fans will get is from the vast array of new characters most interesting of which is the criminally underused Dead pool (Ryan Reynolds). Is it an awful movie? Not really. The phrase below par seems adequate here. Its feels rushed, undercooked yet overblown at the same time. The action scenes are admirable at best blending real backgrounds with some of the ugliest CGI I've ever laid my eves upo¬¨n. The gruff, steel-clawed Marvel superhero Wolverine strikes out on his own in this X-Men spin-off starring series regular Hugh Jackman. The film is set up as an origin tale for the character, and will find him sharing the screen with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), John Wraith (will.i.am), Victor Creed/Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber), and Col. William Stryker (Danny Huston). Academy Award-winning director Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) films a screenplay penned by Troy scribe David Benioff. Daniel Henney and Lost's Dominic Monaghan round out the supporting cast.<br/><br/>What works for the movie are twofold, it's simple structure is fool proof. There isn't a second where you'll get lost and it acts as an idiots guide to the series, obviously causing a problem for readers of the X-men comics. It's insanely undemanding leaving skipping key events and undermining characters that should play a pivotal role. None of which is going to matter to the passing movie goer. The acting is a step up for the series with bright spark Danny Huston taking over from Brian Cox as William Stryker. Liev Schreiber, a personal favourite of mine, plays Sabretooth with a veracious and cold nature and is only ever stumbles when he is stricken with poor dialogue. Here is where the film falls flat on its face, granted the series is well known for its campy dialogue - (anyone remember the Juggernaut) - here the dialogue is so underwritten and textbook that its almost uncomfortable to watch each character stagger over every line they deliver.<br/><br/>It's a shame really, if anyone remembers director Gavin Hood's previous work (Rendition, Tsotsi) then you'll know he is capable of great things. With this it doesn't show. His direction is lost in a haze of special effects and poorly choreographed fight sequences. Never before have I wanted Bryan Singer to get behind the wheel. The film runs at approximately 107 minutes, which is at best 20 minutes too long. Granted this movie is aimed more at the younger children than it is at me. Maybe I'm just too old for this, but if old man Logan were watching this I'm pretty sure he'd have a thing or two to say. Which brings up the concluding point, this is a film designed to repel fans boys. It placates to those in the need for a mindless actioner without any complex narrative, if you've never picked up a comic in your life, by all means go have fun. The rest of us will have to wait until next time to get the origin story we deserve.<br/><br/>Verdict: At best Wolverine is undemanding, placating to an audience too young to appreciate the comics it's based upon. The older audiences will only turn their nose at the poor fight choreography, drastically drab visuals and a story so effortless it for shames that of its video game counterpart. This clunky prequel doesn't even make an effort to maintain a semblance of balance between story and spectacle, characters and special effects. For my overall rating I give X-Men Origins: Wolverine an unenthusiastic 2/5."
"atarimarinas","4","34","87","2 May 2009"," Speechless
","I saw this movie opening night, the theater was packed and everybody was excited about watching the movie. I had low expectations because i knew that it would just be a movie that was just made to make money and that is it. They did not even make an effort for the public cause the studios knew that we would watch it even if it sucked. The downfall of the movie started just as the movie did. The movie is completely predictable. They butcher character stories and mix characters that don't have anything to do with each other. I am kind of picky with the special effects but this was just another level of crappy, overuse of CGI. The dialog was terrible, just like the story. And characters they were all so lame. My advice is: DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. If you do, then movies like this will keep coming out and theaters would be filled with garbage in reels."
"rajandey","10","22","53","30 April 2009"," Wolverine rocks!
","Wolverine is exactly what it needed to be. The story has been written to perfection in my opinion. <br/><br/>As far as i can remember the comics never really revealed much about the origins of Wolverine, therefore I think it is not wise to compare this movie completely to the whole comic series. See this as an individual product and you wont find any flaws. <br/><br/>The story doesn't contradict itself unlike other X-men movies, which is a big plus point. Hugh Jackman has delivered a knock-out performance, so has the rest of the cast, especially Liev Schreiber.<br/><br/>Hats off to the action director of this movie for making beautiful action sequences. Special effects are something to look out for in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this flick to the max.<br/><br/>If you are a person that is tempted to compare this movie the existing comics then i suggest you watch this on DVD after a few years, otherwise.. if you are ready to watch this as an individual product then go for it... you wont be disappointed. <br/><br/>Wolverine = 10 on 10!"

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","7","13","6 May 2009"," Tends to entertain
","I'll start by saying that I honestly have not read any of the source material about at least half of who appears in this. I cannot comment on how those were done. I haven't watched the leaked version. This is a mixed bag, and it definitely could have been better. The very beginning is unclear and muddled, and (what describes much else in this) a disappointing waste of potential. I'll go over the positive first. Jackman basically *is* Wolverine. Schreiber does the attitude and sadism of Creed well, and he did bulk up for this. Reynolds is spot-on, when he's there. This is more raw than the X-Men films, and the tone is darker, whilst following the realism-based approach of them. The term ""badass"" fits well. The action is almost invariably awesome, enjoyable and exciting. The fights are well-done. The bone claws, as far as I know and could tell, were done right. The CGI is marvelous. This doesn't overstay its welcome. It ties into the other reasonably well. Now... this manages to have the same problem as the trilogy it's sort of a spin-off of. They try to fit in too many characters and powered people, and most get little to no personality, screen time or stuff to do. However, unlike that series, here, they aren't written around as much, you'll know what they do instead, if you have seen it, and you shouldn't if you haven't. Abilities are shoehorned in some, and the script, at times, feels like it was put together around the showdowns and such that they wanted in there, trying to include every mutant that they wanted, or that they felt the audience would wish to see in there. The nods at the comics range somewhat. The pace is uneven, rushing at points. The drama is actually effective, at its best, and captures some of the core of the anti-hero. It's sad that there are typical clich√©s and that, at the worst times, this feels like a lame revenge flick. It does hold nice twists, and there are excellent moments in this... what they do with the ""procedure"" in this is nice and well-done. It's all shot well, cinematography and editing are great. The acting is... not all quite good. Several depictions leave something to be desired. There is violence and disturbing content in this, if bloodless. There is infrequent, moderately strong language. I recommend this to fans of the graphic novels, the movie franchise and those who helped make this. 7/10"
"lambiepie-2","7","7","13","3 May 2009"," Aw...Come on everybody....!
","I'll admit...I never read the comic, I basically knew who Wolverine and Sabertooth were and based on that it is an ... okay flick.<br/><br/>It seemed to try to tie itself to the other three X-Men Flicks out there as not to disrupt what is already on celluloid. Maybe that is why I could follow it more than the fans who know the comic book bell, book and cradle.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is always nice to see as Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth was okay as well. Not as bloodthirsty as I believe he could have been though. The first part of the movie really gets your attention - and how Wolverine becomes Wolverine is...interesting. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is doing a fine piece of work here...and then there's Taylor Kitsch as Gambit. I really wanted to know more about Gambit, and what they showed of him was interesting enough, but not in depth enough, as with Deadpool. Focusing on those 4 would have been fine enough of a story...the rest of the folks seemed awfully padded with an awfully padded storyline.<br/><br/>And...I was a big fan of Brian Cox (X2) as Stryker - he was cold, chilling kind of man, and this Stryker wasn't quite up to that - or made me believe that years from this story he would turn into the devious/coldness of Brian Cox as Stryker. But again..the movie was so-so. Not as horrid as many are saying, but not as great as it could have been."
"DarthVoorhees","6","9","18","2 May 2009"," Beat my expectations, which were pretty low
","Wolverine is an exercise in mediocrity. It's the best way to sum up the film and be fair to it. I walked into the picture not expecting much, the hype was generally saying the film would disappoint. It doesn't, I got exactly what I expected, Hugh Jackman slashing hordes of henchmen around a loose plot. Wolverine is designed simply to serve as a summer blockbuster, and this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Go into Wolverine expecting an ""Iron Man"" or God forbid a ""Dark Knight"" you will leave extremely disappointed, but if you expect action and Jackman eating up the screen well then my friend you will get your money's worth.<br/><br/>There is a total lack of character development in the picture. No character is fleshed out, all of them are simply walking plot pieces designed to take the story from point A to point B. We never truly get to know any character at all, even our hero is a mystery to us. I have been waiting for this prequel/origin story since the brilliant X2 and it is kind of a let down to see it executed in this fashion. The story is simply that Wolverine is simply looking to cut up his brother Victor Creed and anyone who gets in his way. Victor and Wolfie have similar powers and have been brothers in arms for nearly two centuries. Why there relationship would delude so quickly is up for debate. Colonel William Stryker is the true villain. Stryker wants to create the ultimate mutant to serve as his super weapon. Which is hinted at in Singer's X-Men films, but here it really isn't touched upon to satisfaction. Stryker was the most interesting character in X2 because he both hates and loves mutants for their extreme power. The idea of what he sees them to be made for interesting motives. Personally I was hoping to see Stryker's failed relationship with his son Jason on film. By the time of X2, Stryker has grown to truly hate mutants, here he has a jealousy for their power. It just leaves too much to be inferred in my opinion.<br/><br/>There are mutants a plenty in Wolverine, none of whom we truly care about or are genuinely amazed by. They all have pretty standard powers and characters in the comics are shown simply to please fans despite the fact that they don't match the comic's intent. Gambit is merely there to make an action figure.<br/><br/>Again this was what I expected of Wolverine. I didn't pay to see character development or to get to know mutants. I knew there would be deficiency in these departments. Surpirsingly they weren't as excessive as what I was lead to believe. Liev Schrieber whom I think is the film's strongest point has a genuinely satisfying story behind his character and the relationship with his brother Jimmy. Stryker's plan to end Wolverine's threat is actually pretty brilliant. The one character whose lack of development hurts the film is our main character.<br/><br/>We don't know Wolverine at all. He wants to do good and yet we don't know why. Why does he have faith in humanity even before his Weapon X treatment? Wolverine Post X was supposed to be a different character. He didn't know who he truly was and he was scared that he may have been what he hated. This Wolverine is all the same, cheap cigars, punchlines, and that horrible haircut. I expected a change in Jackman's intent or performance. Stryker's line in X2, ""As I recall you volunteered for the procedure"" and Magneto's constant warnings lead you to believe that Wolverine had a seedy past, that was what I was hoping to see more of and that is my greatest disappointment with the picture.<br/><br/>Another disappointment is the total lack of social commentary from the other films. The idea of being an outcast as a mutant is completely gone here when it should serve a purpose with Stryker. Wolverine could have evolved over the course of the film and been called to be the hero Charles Xavier wanted him to be. We don't see mutation being thought of as anything other than the explanation for powers. By doing this you miss out on why X-Men is/was such a relevant and intelligent comic.<br/><br/>Gavin Hood does an excellent job with a downright poor script. The action scenes are extremely impressive. I wish he was given a meatier script because I know he could have better showcased his talent. Hood is a very competent director and if they wanted pure brainless action only they should have gone for Len Wiseman.<br/><br/>All in all it delivers what it advertises, pure escapism with superheroes in the summer."

","Way to start the summer, Marvel. This is a prequel to a series of mostly decent comic book movies - I'd rank the second one, X2, as maybe the second or third best comic book movie ever. It concerns the origin of the series' most popular character, Wolverine. Well, that's kind of a lie. It's not really that concerned with anything. It's an indifferently created action movie that goes through the clich√© plot line ploddingly. Dialogue is flat, as is the acting. The film is overly violent but completely bloodless - I hate when they edit an R-rated movie into a PG-13 rated movie. At least it's sometimes laughable. Try not to giggle every time Wolverine is on his knees, hands (and claws) spread, screaming ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" That happens four times in the story, and the movie flashes back to one of those times at least once, as well. There's hardly a good thing I can say about it. It's a stinker, probably the worst summer blockbuster since Van Helsing. Sorry, Mr. Jackman. I have nothing against you, but these two movies are beyond abysmal."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is basically a soulless movie. I found almost all of the performances to be good, Hugh Jackman was great as always. The visual effects were good, the stunts were good, etc.<br/><br/>The movie falls apart due to the writing. All the relationships between characters feel like they were just thrown together randomly because it was convenient. Wolverines past ( pre-adamantium ) takes up about the first 5 minutes of the movie, with some creative writing that 100ish years of his life could have been very interesting.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is an excuse to get as many mutants on stage as they can. Wolverine's back story takes second place to this and suffers due to that."

","*SNIKT!* This feral mutant gets his own movie, how neat! Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) aka James Howlett, aka Logan gets to know more about himself in this movie. Born in the 1800's, this mutant has the claws to tear through his enemies like a hot knife through butter. He gets to join the armed forces with his ""brother"" Victor Creed(Liev Schrieber), aka ""Sabertooth"". These berserkers have fought side-by side and against each other. I liked the part where Wolverine gets his bones laced with the ultra-hard metal called Adamantium. It makes his bones ultra-durable and his claws ultra-deadly. The other characters were great: Wade Wilson aka ""Deadpool""(Ryan Reynolds), Fred J. Dukes aka ""The Blob""(Kevin Durand), and several others in there too long long to remember. Berserker barrages, feral impulses gives the movie an edge that the other ones didn't have, and since the movie is based on Logan's questionable past, knowing who's who is a mystery to anyone. Gambit(Taylor Kitsch) is just a s resourceful as Kayla Silverfox was. His kinetic cards has plenty of impact to the situation. This movie has plenty to go on; plot, humor, action, and intrigue.

","The negative critiques of this movie notwithstanding, this is definitely one of the better movies of the science fiction genre. For this movie to work one must judge this movie for what it is: science fiction. Otherwise this movie will be barely watchable. Hugh Jackman gives a strong performance as Wolverine and the supporting cast led by L. Schreiber are equally good as the movie takes the audience on a wild ride through war and sibling conflict. Although based on a comic book story, the plot is sufficiently complex to actually maintain audience interest and that combined with excellent special effects raises this movie to a level that is somewhere between good and very good, and for a movie that features characters who are, to put it mildly, strange, this is saying a lot."

","When the X-Men series first premiered it was at the dawn of the new age of superheroes, and it was something of a revelation. For the first time, we were presented with mutants, heroes that were completely relatable. Instead of watching a campy B Movie, we were transported into an impossible world that seemed entirely plausible. While holding on to a great spirit of fun, the X-Men examined themes deeper than superhero movies; acceptance, identity, compassion, and forgiveness.<br/><br/>It's clear from the very beginning that X-Men Origins: Wolverine contains none of that. From the early-America set opening to the special effects overload finale, we are treated to nothing more than skin-deep cheesy pop. Even the cast list confirms the film's empty notions.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber lead the cast as mutant brothers without a place in the world. As the film rushes forward with little to no room for thought, they are approached by Col. William Stryker to join a top secret team of mutants going around the world on unclear missions. However, it's not long before the massive amount of killing being done becomes too much for our hero and he leaves the team to try and live life as a common man away from it all, which is, of course, impossible. You know where it goes from there.<br/><br/>Unfortunately even the ample charms of Mr. Jackman can't save this unadmirable dud. Despite having the makings of a decent plot on their hands, the film dissolves into nothing more than actiony silliness. That would still be somewhat acceptable, if it weren't for the tint it leaves on the source material. Instead of finding ourselves transported back into the thought-provoking wonder world we came to expect from this series, this thoughtless money-maker feels nothing but shallow. And with the recent advances made by films like The Dark knight and Iron Man to turn the superhero genre into a form truly respectable, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a dark spot in the repertoire. Do yourself a favor: skip this one and stick to the great original series. 3/10 stars, and that's a compliment.<br/><br/>Jay Addison"

Bad writing. Terrible action and overly CG FX. Characters appearing from nowhere (all of Stryker's team) with little to no characterization.

","Earlier this week, my wife and I caught an early press screening for the upcoming X-Men Origins: Wolverine and we both went absolutely bananas. The screening was held in Ramat Gan, Israel, on an enormous screen, and it was a real delight. The surround sound system and the huge screen gave it all an epic feel, and helped emphasize the magnitude of the movie. At the end of the day, I found it to be on par with Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, X2 and other successful comic book films from the wonderful universe of Marvel.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I went into the film without any big expectations, since I don't carry much knowledge about the character's background - and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised both by Hugh Jackman's engaging portrayal of the character and the light shed not only on Wolverine's origins - but on many of the other members of the X-Men as well... Back when the original trilogy was released (in 2000, 2003 & 2006) I managed to catch them all, and after reaching the new installment to the series, i'm happy to report that X-Men Origins: Wolverine corresponds successfully with the series, while still managing to rise and shine on it's own merit. Wolverine's story was a gripping tale of revenge and knowing one's boundaries, and served as a successful prequel to the whole X-Men series.<br/><br/>The way I see it, All people involved in this spectacular summer hit deserve a great big kudos. I really hope the fact that a work-print version was leaked to the internet a month before the theatrical release won't hurt this film's truly deserved chances at box office glory come early May. In my opinion, this is a movie meant to be seen on a big screen if i've ever seen one. If this thing flops because of the leak, more quality products of it's ilk won't get a cinematic release, and we'll all be sorry... <br/><br/>All in all, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was real cinematic fun, and an excellent set-up for (what seems like) a truly spectacular Summer of films.

","After the X-Men's ""Last Stand"" and Wolverine's indestructible leather pants, my expectations going into a movie about Wolverine's origin story were extremely low (bordering on nonexistent). For this movie to be exciting in any way, you must either be a vegetable or seeing a ""movie"" for the first time. Sadly I fit into neither category.<br/><br/>I was conscious of my bias from the start. I own first editions of just about any comic book with the words ""Wolverine"" on it as well as Joe Madureira feral-Wolvie ink on my arm (circa 1997). I liked the trailers and word-of-mouth from the leaked torrent viewers was good. The thing that I saw was not.<br/><br/>The opening scene recounts the basic story of the ""Origins"" limited series, in which the the man who would be Wolverine started off in the mid 19th century as the sickly child of John Howlett. After an altercation between his dad and the groundskeeper, an enraged boy pops his claws, murders and then runs for his life. The groundskeeper's son, Victor, accompanies him. According to the movie, Wolverine's mother had an affair with the groundskeeper and Victor is his brother. Fine, artistic licensing.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie ensues, with a montage of the two ""brothers"" fighting in every major conflict throughout the world. With the montage complete, the drudgery ensues. They are then recruited by William Stryker for a covert team, comprised of other mutants. While Victor becomes increasingly bloodthirsty over the years, Wolverine increasingly finds it distasteful and eventually drops out. He ends up living as a lumberjack in the wilds of Canada with this girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox. Just as Michael Corleone could not escape his ""family"" neither can Wolverine. His past returns and his girlfriend ends up as collateral damage. Revenge trip ensues.<br/><br/>The remaining lump of coal is a confused mash up of CG, explosions, random occurrences of X-Men characters (Emma ""Silver Fox""??, Cyclops, the Blob, a should have stayed hidden Gambit and an almost unrecognizable Deadpool), wire work, violence and convoluted conspiracies gone awry. I was prepared for a mindless action-butchering of the Wolverine character. It was definitely a mindless butchering, but the action was less than gratifying. Ridiculous is a more accurate description of the action (there is no tongue in cheek here). The movie feels rushed and confused. It wants to be a mindless and enjoyable summer action movie (the result is ridiculously derived and boring) and also wants emotional depth (the motivations are there, paper thin and transparent). <br/><br/>The closest comparison I can muster is the emasculation of Thomas Jane's Punisher. Wolverine, just like the Punisher, will probably never have a good live-action adaptation because the people involved do not understand the characters or imbue them with characteristics not present. The failure is not in the adaption of the source, but in the very essence of the movie. It is flawed all around and tries to tell too much of the story in one sitting. I was ready for a completely different origin story from the comic sources. I was ready for mind-numbing action (see Crank for an example). Instead (and based off the title), we are left with a cheap looking (not cheaply made, however) and marketing based serial action film. Expect X-Men Origins: (fill in the X-Men member here), soon in a theater near you.<br/><br/>-Celluloid Rehab"

His accent was barely audible with the guy they chose, and the costume was horrid. And Deadpool... you have GOT to be kidding me. He was one of my favorite characters, witty, cool swords, his powers. But they messed him up in ways you can't even imagine. Not to mention the screen time the two characters were given was pathetic. Besides those two characters, the special effects were not up to par.

I was not the biggest fan of the X Men films, but I loved this film.<br/><br/>Basically the film is about Wolverine(go figure). It shows how he gave up a life of violence to try to live a normal life, only to have to go back to what he wanted to get away from.<br/><br/>A lot of credit should be given to Hugh Jackman. He really does an outstanding job as Wolverine in this film. You do not see many performances better than his in a comic book style film.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good in this film. There are some flaws though. I think they may have jumped to Wolverine as an adult too quickly, they really did not even scratch the surface of what his childhood was about. But I think that helps the film to get going fast, basically most of the back story is shown in the opening credits. It jumps to the main story right away. I do not think that choosing to not show much of his childhood is necessarily a bad thing, like I said, it helps the film to get going.<br/><br/>The action is legendary in this film. Wolverine gets in a lot of action as do many of the other characters. It is a spectacle to behold and some of the better action scenes in a film in a while. Better than anything that was in the other X Men films.<br/><br/>I also liked the villains. Sabertooth was great, great background and motives as well as just being a scary guy. I was looking forward to seeing Deadpool and I thought he was portrayed in a unique and interesting way. Also agent Striker was great as the backstabbing U.S. Agent type.<br/><br/>Gambit I was looking forward to as well. He was OK, but it seemed that he was there to serve only one purpose and did not do enough. Also I do not understand why Cyclops was in the film.<br/><br/>So I liked this film, this is the new best Marvel film in my opinion. I hope that there are more great Origin Films to come.

"Quinoa1984","3","10","22","7 May 2009"," no matter how hard it tries, this is soulless, bloodless, unnecessary storytelling
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine could be a prime example for what is superbly wrong with Hollywood film-making. There is a director credited here, Gavin Hood, who has made good movies such as Tsotsi. Perhaps they hired him for that, or for his previous film (unseen by me) Rendition. Or, further perhaps, they knew he could be pushed around for a good paycheck. Maybe he does love the Wolverine character and the X-Men franchise, but from a standpoint of only seeing the film as evidence, it doesn't look that way. This looks more to be a case of film-making-by-committee, where a whole gaggle of producers and studio heads (not least of which Tom Rothman) called the shots on what would happen in this story. Which, ultimately, wasn't really necessary in context of the other movies (or at least the first two).<br/><br/>Wolverine, as a character, is captivating and a bad-ass in the comics. In the first two films it's Jackman's performance, and some clever ambiguity, that make him worth watching and a pivotal character, of actually not knowing a whole lot about his past (save for some exposition and the character Stryker, then played by Brian Cox). By delving into this character's back-story, who from what I've heard and been told has one of the most convoluted and complicated backstories in the history of the comic-book medium, there's a whole lot of noise and whistles but not any depth. I didn't learn or gain anything about Wolverine/Logan/Jimmy(?) in the entire running time, except that if you possibly kill the love of his life then, well, he'll get revenge. And, really, if you had claws that could retract and lived over 150 years and was basically indestructible *before* Adamantium, you'd be ticked too.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a story that holds very little water to start with and has to work hard to give us something, anything, to care about what will happen to an indestructible man-beast like Wolverine. Jackman is game, but what about the other actors? Liev Schieber grunts and barely acts his way through his Sabretooth, while Ryan Reynolds, who may someday give us something as a version of Deadpool, only acts like that for all of five minutes before he's yanked off only to return late in the film (as apparently a very funny and witty self-conscious comic character in print) without any dialog to speak of! Others like Will.I.Am (yes, that's how his name is spelled) don't bring much at all, while there's some other room for thankless cameos - my favorite (by that I mean the one I was equally mortified and ironically amused by) was Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, appearing before some lost mutants before disaster strikes, his face super-smooth and looking so CGI you'd swear Brandon Routh was neo-realist in comparison.<br/><br/>There's simply no invention, nothing that stands out even as a fun bad choice; this is more akin to Fantastic Four than something that is really *fun* bad like The Spirit or Ghost Rider. You have to keep your eyelids open by force just from not being bored by the films generic tendencies, most prominent when it tries to give some sense of humor (totally dulled or with the lowest common denominator of gag, i.e. ""oh, my claws broke your sink, um, ha?), but especially when delving into the action sequences. No personality, nothing to make it stand out from probably much superior video games, and whatever inanities present can't even give rise to unintentional laughter. It's hack work through and through.<br/><br/>And the same goes with the story itself, and its super-duper-holy-s*** contrivances. Adamantium is one thing, that's a given, even if one wonders why Wolverine would need or want it thanks to his already near indestructible nature (sorry to harp on it again, it appears vaguely important to me given Wolverine's attitude towards it and Stryker). But the Amnesia-bullets... do I need to go on?"

Cut to scene that makes no sense me t to the one before it, and will no doubt make no sense next to the one following it."" Not one time did I get invested in a character. Countless story lines were left needlessly open-ended. The only emotion was in the loud growling sort. Or the eye drop rolling down the cheek sort.

","This is a great movie! I don't care what the X-men hard core people say about it, it's a great movie. It delivers entertainment, and heap loads at that! Movies are made to entertain people, and that's exactly what this movie does, and wow, does this do a great job at it. <br/><br/>If you've seen the previous X-men movies, then this will bring Wolverine back full circle, or if you haven't, then you can watch this and go back to the original series and appreciate them more than we did before when it first came around. <br/><br/>This installment of the X-men franchise deals with wolverine, and I think it's a great idea to elongate the whole franchise and bring us loads of great action movies. (Like as I've heard the Magneto movie?) <br/><br/>All I have to say is that X-men fanatics shouldn't be so upset about this, yes we know you've read EVERY episode, and yes, I know I don't fully understand the whole story, but why does that matter so much? There are so many movies out there that do a worse job at adaptations, and can't even deliver good entertainment at that. (Think Transformers, it sucked at adaptations, but it brought us loads of entertainment ... Michael Bay style, but still... Wolverine is better than that and you know it!) <br/><br/>People hated ""The Da Vinci Code"", and I hope Ron Howard learned from that, because not only did it ignore the original pace of the book, but it sucked at being a decent movie as well. X-men might have ignored some parts of the original series, but at least it provided outstanding acting and action, and sometimes that's all that matters in a movie. <br/><br/>Please, if you are looking through the reviews to make up your mind about this movie, then please, do yourself a favor, go watch this movie. It's probably the best thing you're gonna do for yourself that day."

","I recognize that a lot of people disliked this movie, claiming that the characters are simply props for Logan and don't do justice to their comic book counterparts. Let me preface my next statement by saying yes, I've read the Origin comics, I've read Weapon X, and close to every Deadpool story arch(Including the god awful apocalyptic one where he's a Pale Rider), Among other X-Men story arcs. I'm well versed in comic books as I've been reading them since I was 8 years old (18 now). So let me just say, Stop being purists. Unless the movie is specifically stated to be an adaptation of a specific story arch or series, don't expect it to be. This was an entirely new story combining a number of various elements from multiple story arcs. That being said the movie was enjoyable amongst a few problems, namely a few continuity issues and the extremely weak way in which they explain Wolverine's complete and total ignorance in the first 3 X-Men ""Movies"" In my opinion it was much more enjoyable than any of the first 3 with the debatable exception of X2. As for the characters they work well playing their parts in Logan's mission, being introduced, much like characters in comic books, in small ways to gauge fan reactions to ""test the waters"" if you will for possible spin off films. Worth the money to see it, and hope to God you get the Deadpool ending."
"ebiros2","3","5","9","27 May 2009"," Bring back Bryan Singer
","This movie fails in the way other film adaptation of comic book heroes. The producers and the director has no clue as to what makes the characters and the actions work, and they just cut and paste few scenes and plots they liked skimming through past issues of the comic franchise. And they always put in tons of CG action to compensate for the lack of convincing story line.<br/><br/>This didn't happen in the first two X men movie. Director Bryan Singer did a masterful job of telling an original story that didn't mess up the original plot or the characters of X-men, which attests to his talent as a story teller and a visual artist. His story telling was compelling, but none of that depth is seen on this movie. Maybe they don't care. They just want to make quick bucks. But if they kept this up, movie industry would be in the same dive music world is in right now.<br/><br/>This movie could have been better, but didn't live up to its potential."

","I did not read the X-Men comics but, I did watch some of the 90's cartoons since I grew up in the 90's, played a few video games, and saw all three of the X-men films. I saw this film since my favorite all time X-men character is Wolverine.<br/><br/>This movie was decent. Not great, just decent. It had great eye popping action, excellent special effects, and explained to me as the viewer a little bit more about Striker, and who he was as well as Wolverine. The film gave a little bit of a background for Logan as a person, and the hero we known him as. One thing that I never understood is why Logan (aka)Wolverine never remember what happen to him with the mutant X surgery thing that happened. That was explained at the end of the film.<br/><br/>So as the viewer, you can get a lot out of this film. Some great action, excellent special effects, and some background on your favorite character. The only thing I did not like was that the movie seemed and felt a little rushed, and it should have focused in a little bit more on what Striker was really planning. But other then that I'd say consider seeing it."
"ennieday09","8","5","9","1 May 2009"," Great film, with great action sequences but lacks some character development
","I saw this movie midnight opening and don't regret it at all. I can see why some people do not like this movie but from my perspective, i enjoyed it very much. Let me give my explanation without giving any spoilers....<br/><br/>The people who didn't like this movie were probably die hard fans of the old comics with Deadpool, Agent Zero, and many of the other ""sub"" characters. I am a big fan of X-Men and the franchise but not a die hard comic-con type fan, nor have i read the comics so i enjoyed this movie based on the action sequences and explanation of Wolverine's past which leads up to the X-Men series. Hugh Jackman was great as usual, and the explanation about his Weapon X transformation and relationship with all the other characters is very clear. Only problem i had with this movie was that it was about 50% Wolverine(obviously hence the title which is stupid for people to complain about that) 20% Sabertooth, 20% William Stryker and 10% every other character combined. <br/><br/>I think the trailer gave snippets of every character, leaving the audience to believe OMG Gambit, The Blob, even Cyclops are in the movie!!! and they are in it for about 5-10 minutes and left some people disappointed. I was very hyped to see Gambit and Deadpool in the movie but their screen time was extremely limited. All in all, i thought it was a good movie, mostly because Hugh Jackman pulls off Wolverine flawlessly and the action sequences were better than any other movie i have seen in a while. So i recommend this to anyone who isn't looking for The Dark Knight type movie but more of a wildly action epic with a great explanation of Wolverines characters past"

People, I'm not a hardcore fan but the fact that GAMBIT didn't said a single word in french or at least had a tone, well it really sucked. No explicit violence which is good for the families and characters for the families not WOLVERINE, we should have to see guts and blood all around.<br/><br/>Sorry, but I'm very disappointed, they losed a perfect opportunity to make a master piece and box office hit.<br/><br/>If you don't care anything of the things above go watch it and you might enjoy it.<br/><br/>Best regards."

","Let me first say that I am a person who doesn't read / writes reviews, I do not care about other people's opinion, nor do I believe that anyone should care for mine. Let me also state that I am a comic book fan, and that my viewpoint of the movie is from someone who had previously read years of material of the characters portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>First off, the movie is VERY different from the actual storyline, besides their names, most of the characters in this movie are have their powers/ story/ and relations completely made up.<br/><br/>The story itself is hard to believe, and can't be taken seriously (Though this is a fantasy movie, simple logic such as ""why didn't he just do this..."" will be though more than enough.) The plot in the movie is stupid, in the comic the plot itself was confusing and hard to follow, but it still made sense. In this movie, it not only ignores the comic's storyline to make it simple, but instead makes it unrealistic and borderline retarded.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain without actually spoiling the movie, but seeing that it's leaked on the internet, do yourself a favor and download it rather than spend your money to a company who rather milk the cash cow for all it's worth rather than give back to the people who supported them.<br/><br/>Overall, if you know who Wolverine is, know the Marvel Universe, or have ANY idea of his story STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!! If you have no idea what the words Weapon X, Deadpool or, Marvel Universe are, and you want to see a sub par movie that will be given praise it doesn't deserve, go see it."

Second... Physics? But lets leave that as characters have ""super-powers."" Third it bends X-Men over a barrel and violates it ways that any civilised society would reintroduce the death penalty to adequately punish.<br/><br/>However the most important complaint is: its lame. Completely and totally unbelievable, ridiculous and lame. It actually got to the point where I didn't like Wolverine anymore (at least this incarnation), not to mention all the other characters. It had more action movie clich√É¬©s than Schwarzenneger's Last Action Hero which tried to put as many as possible in so it could satire them.

","Hollywood once again has bit its teeth down into something that could have been exceptional, but the horrible casting and the less than par writing leaves you with a nasty taste in your mouth. I'm a moderate collector of vintage silver/bronze age comics and i have to tell you that the casting for this movie would insult any comic reader, or anybody who has seen the cartoon. Deadpool is played by Ryan Reynolds, no offense Ryan your a funny guy but for god's sake if that doesn't give you an indication of the horrible casting i don't know what will. Sabretooth was slightly less disappointing even though he doesn't have his long lion's mane haircut, but Liev Schreiber brought some decent acting to the table. Hugh Jackman in my personal opinion was most certainly not the right man to play wolverine and his acting isn't exactly spot on at times. He seems too much like a pretty boy trying to play Rambo. The movie itself makes me sigh. I was most disappointed because almost every climax and major action sequence in the film the outcome can be predicted. Thank you 20th century fox for creating yet another piece of comic inspired trash, you would think they would have learned from Warner Brothers. Go do yourself a favor and rent the dark night or go see watchmen instead..."
"marvelmanny","9","6","12","16 May 2009"," Excellent and awesome.
","Those were the two words I had when I was watching this film.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Cause it was just a great action film. Now before I start giving my ""opinion"" I just want to say that I'm not going to explain the movie to you. That's what the synopsis at the beginning of the page is for. <br/><br/>Let me just start by saying I love back-stories. That is the reason why people saw this movie. I mean there's a reason why they called this film X-Men Origins- because back-stories and explanation is what put peoples rumps in the movie theater- especially when it's the back-story of the most popular X-Man to date. You know who I'm talking' about. I'm talking' about Wolverine baby, and let's just say Hugh Jackman has this character in this pocket, and you can see that he's into it. I mean this is one character you don't wanna play half arsed (I don't like cussing) because every fan in the world is gonna ream you for it.<br/><br/>And Liev Schrieber? Well let's just say he is the pepper to Wolverine's salt, the back to Wolverine's front, he compliments him in every way. And they put in an interesting little tid bit involving Sabretooth and Wolverine. Excellent.<br/><br/>And the battles- well I would almost say the battles are revolutionary. I think it will bring comic film cinema to new heights. Rarely does a comic book film have action the ENTIRE way through. And that is awesome.<br/><br/>I must say I was rather shocked about the low rating of Wolverine on this site. I don't know what people want out movies these days. It has everything, action, humor, intrigue, good acting- you know- the works. I just think people put films in a box. They become so critical that they can hardly enjoy them. I think sometimes people let small stuff get to them, and they miss the whole experience of the film. Just have fun. I mean that's why they made this film in the first place. <br/><br/>You pay ten bucks. Might as well enjoy it."
"tarantinobopper","8","6","12","8 May 2009"," X Men Tale of love, and betrayal
","I have only seen the first X Men and this one. I liked them both, a lot. There has been a lot of talk about Brian Singer being such a great director, and though the direction of this particular movie is based more on action than the Brian Singer movie(s) it is still a very good film. The settings of this movie are very different from the urban original. Here the settings are largely the wilderness. <br/><br/>The film begins with Logan as a child. He commits a grave sin and then runs away from home. His brother, Victor Creed, joins him. the film is a lot to do with brotherhood loyalty. That is, to a large extent, what the film is about. The two Brothers, who fought in many wars together split up. Logan finds it all two corrupt and murderous, while Victor (Sabertooth) seems to revel in the killings. And, as the movie progresses, this becomes a key part of Sabbertooth's psychology. This sets something in motion as Victor stays with the crack team while Logan (Wolverine) takes to chopping down trees for a living. He is made an offer to rejoin William Strykers(their leader) special force and this Logans refusal is the beginning of the end. <br/><br/>To a large extent as I have said before the focus of this film is action but the villains, the hero's and heroine's are very well defined so there is also an emotional impact to the fighting and explosions. But there is also a great deal of tragedy involved. The beautiful Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox is murdered at the beginning. Logan then agrees to have his skeleton made into an ultra tough metal called Adamantium in order to take revenge on his brother. The procedure of turning Logans once bone claw into adamantium is one that very few can survive. Indeed, Wolverine actually flat-lines.<br/><br/>There are many twists along the way. I think I shall get more involved with the X Men comics from now on. In a very tender scene between Kayla and her boyfriend Logan she tells him a tale. This leads to his naming himself Wolverine. The villain William Stryker is a manifold question. Why is he so OBSESSED with hurting Wolverine. In a sense he isn't. He does want Wolverine to be a part of his ideology, it's just that he just can't stand the idea of Wolveine having memory. If he has memory then he will not be a beast or an animal (a constantly occurring motif by the way) and Wolverine will be all too human. But Mr Stryker has something very deadly against mutants. Indeed, he has something very deadly in store for them. But this is the dark secret of the movie. I enjoyed Danny Hustons performance a great deal. A return to the more character based work of the originals.<br/><br/>I found the ending to be truly sad. Some points nearly bringing me to tears."

","I don't agree with any of the criticisms of other reviews about this movie on this page. I've been comic fan of Wolverine since pretty much the beginning. This was before he had ever made it to screen. I was very concerned about this movie when I seen the first trailer because it looked like they were going to try and put several different story lines together (Origins, Weapon X, Wolverine). That is a lot of material to cover in only one hour and forty minutes. After watching the movie I can say I enjoyed it greatly and think they did a good job trying to get the main points of the different story lines while trying to give the audience a basic look at the Wolverine characters origin. They did change things from the comic books but I think it worked out. Hugh Jackman and Live Schreiber literally make the characters Wolverine and Victor (Sabretooth) come right out of the comic books and come to life! I loved this rivalry for years in comics and finally got to see a good interpretation after the sad Sabretooth in the X-Men movie. I only wish I could have gotten more of it. I can't write to much more without giving away a lot of the movie. I'm sorry but I don't care if Deadpool and Gambit didn't get a lot of screen play in this movie. This is the Wolverine Origin and not the Gambit or Deadpool movies. If I can get over Wolverine not being 5'4'' then I don't care if Gambit doesn't have a strong Cajun accent because he did in some cartoon. Overall I'm really glad I seen this movie. I will be buying it when it comes out on DVD."

Jackman had apparently worked out and beefed up for the role, looking much stronger than in the previous X-Men movies, now if only he'd lose some height, ha ha.<br/><br/>This movie strays from the early comics of Wolverine and only about 20% of it remains true to his back-story that was written. The James Howlett story arc is new to the marvel universe and in my opinion a failure. I preferred the mystique of the Wolverine of Old, a hidden past, not knowing much. I've been a huge fan of Marvel comics since I was about 7 and loved picking apart all the things wrong with this movie compared to what I believe is the true Wolverine story.<br/><br/>7/10 For being a story arc that is fairly new explaining Wolverines past as James Howlett, I gave it that rating. <br/><br/>Pretty good for a reworking of his storyline, you'll only be upset if you're truly a comic book fan who followed Wolverine in his early years and hold it to that standard.<br/><br/>Edit: Adrian Paul would have made a better Wolverine. Especially since they're suppose to do the next movie about his time in Japan."

I found it to be pretty much along the same lines as the X-Men movies. Jackman was great as Wolverine, as always. Liev was incredible as Sabretooth. Taylor Kitch impressed me as Gambit, as I had not thought much of him in a previous film I'd seen him in. The rest of the cast was good, but not in a stand-out way.<br/><br/>Overall, if you expect a fun, special-effects and explosions-laden film, you shouldn't be disappointed.

","After the success of the Last Stand, I thought X-Men Origins: Wolverine would be a wrapping up of all the mysteries surrounding Logan. The movie trailer and the initial hype over the leaked release just made the wait harder.<br/><br/>However, the movie is quite poorly made, and certainly places itself as a stumbling block in what could have been an amazing career for director Gavin Hood. Most of the scenes are made quite poorly, and end almost as soon as they begin. It's cheaper to just watch the movie trailer as there's little new in the movie.<br/><br/>The final fight is good from a special effects point of view, but the movie leaves the gaping holes that it was supposed to fill. Logan's memory loss is barely explained. Gambit has almost a losers role throughout, and the future of Sabretooth isn't shown at all.<br/><br/>The least that could have been done for this would be to make a decent one time watch with some amazing special effects and fight scenes, another area that is usually poorly handled.<br/><br/>Only Schreiber's and Jackman's portrayals are worth watching in this film, and they both give stunning performances, which are sadly overshadowed by the poor quality of all other aspects of the film.

","This movie was rather good, I have to say out of all the X-men movies though it was the weakest of the bunch. Not by a lot as I did give it a score of 8, I just found it had some story problems here and there and other issues that the other movies did not have. However, I was surprised the story was somewhat good and not disjointed as it looked like it might be from the trailers, by that I mean the time did not shift from one random scene to another. The story basically shows us how Wolverine became Wolverine and a bit how Sabretooth came about as well though he was never called that in the film. You go through the opening credits going through all the wars they participated in, to their time in a band of mutant mercenaries led by Stryker. After a mishap there Logan (Wolverine) goes to live a more normal life only to find it destroyed by Victor (Sabretooth). After a brutal battle where it is apparent Victor is just to powerful for Logan to fight in his current state, he accepts an offer to go through a procedure that gives him the metal skeleton and claws that we all know and love. The action is rather good in this film though I thought Wolverine had better fights in the previous movies as nothing in this one can really compare to the Lady Deathstrike fight in part II. I liked seeing other mutants from the comics as I thought they did the Blob very well. I was disappointed that Gambit was not in it more, and the one real fight scene he was in was a bit hard to follow, but it was nice just seeing him on film. Scott Summers also makes a brief appearance and they actually showcase his optic blast better in this movie that is mainly a Wolverine feature than they did the other X-men movies. It is not all perfect as Ryan Reynolds character was underused, I did not care for the reason Wolverine lost his memory in the other movies as it seemed to far fetched and kind of weak, and the last fight while cool was kind of a waste of one of the more interesting comic characters. I would rather have seen Omega Red as the final enemy as he would have been cool and you could have used the other character in later movies. Next up is X-men Origins Magneto, but truthfully I would rather see an X-men 4 movie as there were to many loose ends in the Last Stand."

Lots of character cameos. It's entertaining, contains humour, as well as action,story & pathos. It ties in nicely with the X-Men films.<br/><br/>Watch till the end of the credits. I rate it a 7."

","The movie was very good. Some people say that it's not like the other x-men movies. Of course and it's not. It's a different story with Wolverine. It has nothing to do with the x-men. I excepted the movie to be like that. The one thing that disappointed me was that the battles were very ""high Light"". The Special Effect were Awesome and very realistic. The movie was also a bit more violent than the other 3. I liked the way that they present Wolverine. Like an animal. Hugh Jackman Had a lot of passion and I liked that. Another Thing that I didn't like was that Gambit and Deadpool had like a guest star appearance in the movie. The plot was good and easy to follow.

","I went on IMDb right after i saw the movie, expecting great reviews and it only has a 6.9, and i asked my self how is that.<br/><br/>i went into the movie with very high expectations, and by the end of the movie the movie lived up to the hype. X-men Wolverine Origins was one of the best movies I've seen in the past couple months. it had every great element a movie should have. Many people are saying it didn't have a good plot, i found the plot quite good, it tied in a lot of loose ends from the other movies. The story really showed who Logan(wolverine) really is.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber did and amazing acting job in this movie. two thumbs up for both performances. I guess if i had to pick one negative side to this movie is that Ryan Reynolds wasn't in it enough.<br/><br/>but overall i give this movie 9/10 and its a must see, if your a X-men fan, also even if you not an X-men fan you still should see it because its just a great action flick to watch."
"Gav14","9","5","10","2 May 2009"," This movie blew the last two X-men movies away.
","Honestly, I went into this movie expecting it to be a mindless rampage without much of a story, just a lot of fights.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised! The movie did, in fact, have a pretty strong plot. Wolverine's path for revenge was a very strong way to instigate the changes in him that finally brought about the metal claws and adamantium skeleton.<br/><br/>ACTING <br/><br/>Many say that the acting was week but I don't think it was. Hugh Jackman did a good job as Wolverine. The only time the acting was a problem for me was at the beginning with the kids and near the end when we learn of Striker's son.<br/><br/>PLOT <br/><br/>The plot was quite interesting and really fit the movie, and most importantly, the character very well. The plot wasn't lacking and was stronger than some comic book movie plots we've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>ACTION<br/><br/>The action was highly awaited in this movie and we weren't disappointed. Whether it be the chase scene from the farm, his amusing fight with Dukes or the scene against the Mutant-Killer (Weapon 11 I believe)it was all very well done. The final fight (Wolverine + Sabertooth VS. the Mutant-Killer) on the top of that nuclear reactor was absolutely epic and very memorable. The image of the mutant-killers head spinning in circles and destroying the nuclear reactor (I can't think of its actual name unless that is actually correct) will stay with me forever as a very epic piece of cinematic history.<br/><br/>MUSIC <br/><br/>I am going to be perfectly honest, I didn't really pay attention to what music was playing throughout the movie so I can't really comment except to say that although the music wasn't memorable, it didn't harm the film either.<br/><br/>SCRIPT <br/><br/>I found the script to quite good and seemed to flow easily. No hardships there.<br/><br/>All in all, I found the movie to be extremely well done and very enjoyable. I firmly believe that Xmen 2 & 3 are not as good as X-men Origins: Wolverine was."
"mombot","7","5","10","1 May 2009"," I actually liked this, and I'm not an X-men Fan
","For a movie based upon a comic book, it's good fun. I wasn't expecting much, since most critics panned the story (what there was) but gave Jackman and Schreiber high marks for their respective acting skills, as do I. The big surprise was that this was actually good. My kids had a good time and enjoyed the action sequences and could follow the movie's plot easily. Their ages ranged from 6 to 11. Not that it was that simple, but there weren't a lot of silly complicated story sub plots to follow. Some films suffer from too many details. We learned why Wolverine is the way he is in the previous X-Men films (which take place later in the time-line of events). Fight sequences are well done, the cast does a great job with their parts, and the one-liners are funny. It's a good example of why it past the time to use mediocre actors and instead use good and capable actors in an action film. These actors, from Jackman and Schreiber to the others, brought this film up a few levels so I gave it an 7/10."
"blackzwhite","8","5","10","1 May 2009"," A very good solo outing for the #1 Marvel character (Sorry Spidey)
","When it comes to movies based off of comics, many fanboys get upset when things are not done the way they are in the comic. There is a solution to this that if many fanboys used, they would get MUCH more enjoyment out of the films. The solution is to see the movies as happening in an alternate to what they have come to know and love. Doing this makes this (and many other comic movies) WAY better.<br/><br/>The actions and acting was very nicely done. The use of Ryan Reynolds was very short but i gotta say his action scene was the best one. They story stays true to the character of Wolverine in this universe and gives a glimpse into others from that universe. Nice seeing that the Blob also has the chance to be lean if he ever chooses to lose weight.<br/><br/>I have read comics for years and gotta say that this is a good movie based off comics. Knowing it is another universe makes it even more refreshing to see this road that Wolverine could have taken if he volunteered for Weapon X instead of being kidnapped.<br/><br/>Gotta say thank you to all the characters that showed up and did their thing for us to watch. It was very entertaining and left me wanting to see what else will happen with Magneto and Storms venture into X-Men Origin filming.<br/><br/>**SIDENOTE** All the end credit talk on here about seeing something with Wolverine. My showing had no Wolverine in the ending but did remind me of another Wolverine end credit showing with this big green guy.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie as it is what it is: entertaining and fun. Here is waiting for a R-rated to see Wolverine finally be the best at what he does..and what he does ain't pretty (or for the PG-13 ratings)."

","Greetings again from the darkness. While a logical attempt to capitalize on the highly entertaining and profitable X Men series, this prequel just doesn't have much to offer other than a couple of fun fight scenes.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is in full glory and seems to be having fun playing Logan/Wolverine, but his ""brother"" Liev Schreiber is totally miscast and would have been better as Stryker ... though Danny Huston handles it just fine. Will i am, Tayor Kitsch (as Gambit) and Ryan Reynolds provide the only real characters of interest outside of the shiny the apparatus for wolverine.<br/><br/>I guess it is a credit to the film series that we have come to expect more. Though it will be fine with true fans, this won't bring in many new ones."
"killa_man23","5","9","22","1 May 2009"," Enjoyable action but overall an uninspired and convoluted adaptation, sequel, prequel or whatever it wants to be.
","Based on ""Wolverine,"" it's hard to get excited about the prospect. The film exhibits all the overly familiar hallmarks of the 21st-century comic book movie: an inflated sense of its own importance, turgid plotting and action sequences designed to showcase lavish CGI effects.<br/><br/>In many ways, it was the first ""X-Men,"" back in 2000, that set the tone. On the one hand, director Bryan Singer embedded an earnest allegory about prejudice and minority rights; on the other, it was an FX geek's wet dream. Each mutant came with her or his own gimmick: One could shape shift; another could levitate; yet another had a bad case of wind.<br/><br/>The mutants all shared the same nasty temper, but Logan/Wolverine (Jackman) had the shortest fuse -- and the silliest haircut, a '50s duck-tail with ferocious rockabilly sideburns. Predictably enough, ""Origins"" devotes more time to exploring the roots of his anger issues than his hair, but it doesn't worry about where his most distinctive genetic features might have come from: the retractable claws that spring from his knuckles when he's irked and his invulnerability to anything short of decapitation.<br/><br/>In ""Wolverine,"" Logan has lost his taste for war in Vietnam after more than a century as a fighting man (or mutant) and finally walks away in disgust from the elite mutant unit put together by Col. Stryker (Danny Huston). But his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) has other ideas and knows how to get Wolverine to embrace his true, animalistic, nature.<br/><br/>Borrowing wholesale from ""The Incredible Hulk,"" with Schreiber fairly effective in the Abomination part, ""Wolverine"" struggles to establish an identity of its own. The two brothers charge at each other like medieval knights jousting, and Victor -- also known as Sabretooth -- affects a dog-like, four-legged bound. But no matter how often he tries it, director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"") never works out how to make a fight between indestructible foes tense or exciting.<br/><br/>That's the trouble with CG-enhanced action: What you gain in spectacle, you lose in impact. Filmmakers today can engineer destruction on a scale that would have been unimaginable 20 or 30 years ago, but it's all so much collateral damage. It's rare, these days, for an American action movie to impart any genuine sense of pain or hurt or loss. Too much Wow, not enough Ow! In fairness, there are fleeting moments in ""Wolverine"" where we do feel Logan's emotional anguish. But they're only as a prelude to his anger, which is the only quality an audience is likely to find interesting about him.<br/><br/>Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this ""Wolverine"" movie does just enough to keep the ""X-Men"" franchise on life support, but the filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction."
"jmobijohn","7","6","13","1 May 2009"," Adamantium Solid
","I'm a pretty big comic buff and although the film took a lot of liberties with certain characters I still thought it was a pretty decent.<br/><br/>Positives 1. First Half was awesome, the origins were well done if a little bit light on the depth of the characterizations 2. Hugh Jackman is a fantastic Wolverine 3. Action sequences were great 4. Gambit was done some form of justice 5. The casting was on point, I didn't think anyone was miscast in their roles.<br/><br/>Negatives 1. Second Half pretty much fell flat on its face (plot twists do not automatically make a movie more interesting or better) 2. Too many bad ass characters introduced for one movie. They each deserved to get more screen time. 3. I didn't care for the way they handled Deadpool 4. Overuse of wire works and CGI<br/><br/>Origins was much better then Last Stand and although thats not saying much I think the film redeemed a good amount of Last Stands failures. I thought the first half of the film was great but the second half of the movie was where it started to fall apart for me, ironically with the introduction of the fan favorite Gambit (Always liked him but still don't know what all the hoop-la is about). As much as people complain about what was done with Deadpool, I honestly didn't mind it. I actually had an even bigger problem with the blatant disregard of common sense (mutants especially) towards the end of the film. The action sequences were awesome though and I feel thats what made the movie work on more levels then it should have. (I would talk more about my opinions on the plot but I want to respect people who haven't seen it yet) For me it was a damn solid action blockbuster. Its not going to be super memorable but it served its purpose to start off the summer movie season. If your going into the movie with super high expectations you'll be disappointed. As a comic fan I wasn't completely satisfied but I'm not going to be a total hater like some people are and just look for things to rag on for no damn reason. Overall I'd give it a 7/10."
"3xHCCH","8","8","19","30 April 2009"," A Series of Great Imaginative Action Scenes!
","I do not really read the original comics, so I went into this as a fan of the X-Men movies and TV cartoon series. So I am not really sure if this movie was faithful to the story. But having said that, based on its own merits, I think this movie is really awesome. Despite being leaked on the net, this is the sort of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>I think they were correct in choosing Wolverine as the subject of the first movie about the origins of the X-Men. The character has that combination of coolness and mystery that makes for an interesting back story. Where did all his pent-up anger come from?<br/><br/>The movie starts way way back in 1840's when Jimmy (Logan) and his brother Victor (Creed) were still children.These two special invincible children grow up and go through different wars in a great opening sequence montage. Because of their fighting skills and invincibility, the two brothers (now played by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber respectively) were recruited by Stryker to join a special military force.<br/><br/>Logan realized that that life is not right for him so he decided to desert the group. He went on to hook up with a pretty school teacher Kayla (Lynn Collins) as his girlfriend to lead an idyllic life as a lumberjack in Canada, or so he thought. One day, his brother Victor comes back and kills the girlfriend. From there, the whole story of Logan's revenge and retribution, and the actual origin of the Adamantium skeleton of Wolverine will further unfold.<br/><br/>Of course, a movie like this will have to feature special effects. And certainly, the effects here surpass those of the previous X-Men movies. There was that very exciting fight of Logan and Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) involving a motorcycle versus a helicopter. Amazing action choreography there. And the same is true in the scene of Logan, Victor and Weapon XI on one of the towers of Three Mile Island was fantastically rendered. This was because Weapon XI was a swordsman mutant who had been artificially imbued with other mutant powers like those of John Wraith and Cyclops, making for an breathtaking fight. The sound effects and the film editing were fantastic in these scenes and more.<br/><br/>I think all fans of the X-Men movies will like this excellent prequel of sorts to the entire X-Men saga. Gambit finally made an appearance in an X-Men movie, played by Taylor Kitsch. There were already scenes which showed how the young mutants of the earth have gathered together, along with a cameo by a certain bald headed mentor. There was also very nice dramatic touches with the relationship of the two brothers, and the relationship of Logan and his girlfriend Kayla. Script is simple to follow despite the number of stories intertwined. Overall, a very good, thrilling and thoroughly satisfying movie.<br/><br/>**** By the way, there is a scene about Col. Stryker in the middle of the first part of the credits, then another one about Logan at the very end of the credits. You may want to wait up for them, but don't expect too much though."

","Having read every X-Men comic, being a huge Wolverine and Gambit fan, and after enjoying the first 3 X-Men movies immensely, I have to say that this movie was so depressingly bad that I may go to Gavin Hood (the director) and tell him to never produce a film again and stick to the special effects, because it seems to me that that is what this movie was all about, the fluff and sugar coating. NO STRUCTURE WHATSOEVER! I recommend this movie to two types of audiences, those under 13, and to all of those over grown men who are still living in their mother's basements.<br/><br/>Where or where is Christopher Nolan when you need him. The concept of this movie had so much potential.<br/><br/>Please excuse me as I go jump off a cliff. That is, and future X-men movie cliff.<br/><br/>:("

","I am a fan of the X-men story line however, I've never read a single X-men comic. I know what I know only from the previous movies that have been released. So, when I say that this movie was disappointing even from me, I mean that compared with the previous x-men films this new one has huge holes in the storyline. I'd assume that the director had never seen the other movies.<br/><br/>Let me point out a few of the details that I noticed while watching this movie (this is by no means a comprehensive list and I am working from what I remember from the others): The weapon x lab in the other movies is located in what resembles an old dam or similar concrete structure in some remote location far from civilization near a lake with surrounding mountains. In this movie the location is an island located in the middle of a big river near a heavily populated area (seen from the overhead views). Oh, and the lab is located under a nuclear power plant.<br/><br/>Wolverine saves all of the mutant kids that later meet up with xavier and yet he is a complete mystery to all of them when he shows up at the mutant school in other movies. Did they all forget the crazy guy with big metal spikes protruding from between his knuckles? Or is that commonplace in the mutant world? I'm unsatisfied with this film."
"DarthBill","1","7","16","5 May 2009"," Frustrating
","The long awaited solo Wolverine film which Marvel & Fox were apparently grooming their clawed hero for as far back as the first X-Men film, and there's no denying that there was always a favoritism towards him in the previous X-Men films. Ultimately it proves to be a very watered down, very uneven & unsatisfying account of how Wolverine came to be what he is.<br/><br/>The film's sins? Well, it doesn't go nearly as far as it promised it would in showing Wolverine's darker, more savage side, there are humorous moments that don't really belong in the film, characters such as a much younger Cyclops & Gambit (for some reason Gambit is made older than Cyclops, which also makes it impossible to ever do a proper Gambit/Rogue coupling if they follow this continuity) are thrown in just for the Hell of it even though they have nothing to do with Wolverine's origin, the film doesn't mesh very well with the continuity of the previous films, and overall there is an unpleasant sense of style over substance, which has become an unfortunate issue with Fox films ever since Tom Rothman started working there (remember the hack job he put on the Fantastic Four, Daredevil & Elektra films?). And don't get me started on those bullets.<br/><br/>The film's redeeming factors? Well, the over supplied eye candy is well executed. There is some competent acting from the lead Hugh Jackman (in his 4th outing as the clawed one), Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (AKA: Sabertooth) and Danny Huston as a younger Col. Stryker, making it more bearable than say ""Spider-Man 3"" (or even the above mentioned films that suffered at Tom Rothman's misguided hands), but Jackman's steely charisma combined with the strong support of Schreiber & Huston can only do so much against poor dialogue and an uneven tone.<br/><br/>Overall, a disappointment."
"filmtogo","2","3","5","7 June 2018"," How could they?!
","What did the filmmakers think when they created this mess of a film? It's supposedly a prequel to the X-Men franchise centered around Wolverine but X-Men Origins is changing everything there was before (or what will be after). Somehow Liev Schreibers Sabretooth becomes Wolverines brother - and they share a (hands down) kinda cool opening sequence in which they go through the different warfields in time to show us that they're both immortal. But then we get a boring Gambit, a team of throwaway mutants and poor Ryan Reynolds as a guy who is called Deadpool but has nothing in common with him. This film has some little nice ideas in it but the execution is horrible from start to finish."
"jboothmillard","4","3","5","30 June 2011"," X-Men Origins: Wolverine
","The original Marvel X-Men trilogy was pretty good, there were rumours about a few prequels, including Magneto and Professor X, who were seen in First Class, the character focused in this prequel was probably the most popular of the films, so I had to see it. Basically 200 year in the past, mutant brothers were born and suffered childhood trauma, and grew up never ageing over the years to become James (Hugh Jackman) with the power of healing and large claws and Victor Creed aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) with wolf-life qualities and also claws. Young William Stryker (Danny Huston) meets them and offers them a place in Team X, the small elite of mutants including David North aka Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) with the power to absorb kinetic energy, sword specialist Wade Wilson aka Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), teleporter John Wraith (The Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am), extremely obese and strong Fred Dukes aka The Blob (Kevin Durand) and electrically talented Chris Bradley aka Bolt (The Lord of the Rings' Dominic Monaghan), and they do accept for a while. Six year on though James leaves, calling himself Logan or Wolverine and goes to live with girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) in Canada, but she gets killed by Victor who has gone the opposite direction. Therefore Stryker offers Logan an operation which will increase his claw abilities and strength, he will injected with the virtually indestructible metal Adamantium, turning his entire internal skeleton and claws metal, and this operation succeeds. He also gets dog tags saying ""Wolverine"" on them, but he quickly makes his escape when he overhears orders to have his memory erased, and so begins a number of chases to get him back, and at the same time defeat the villains. In the end Logan and Victor have a big fight, which obviously has the good winning, many young mutants, including young Scott Summers aka Cyclops (Tim Pocock), who were captured by Stryker are released and rescued by Professor Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart), and mutant Remy LeBeau aka Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) shoots Logan in the back of the head, causing amnesia, and he walks away to be alone somewhere. Jackman as with the other films is cool with a good amount of aggression and attitude, the supporting actors do their parts pretty well too, as with the predecessors the special effects are fantastic and the action moments are well executed, but the story could have done with a little tweaking to make it a bit more gripping, but it's not a bad fantasy action adventure. Okay!"
"TxMike","Null","3","5","29 September 2009"," Good movie, with very dark themes, explaining the origin of Wolverine.
","With the success of the X-Men movies this one is a sort of prequel. It focuses on how Wolverine came about, since he is perhaps the most popular of the mutants in the X-Men series.<br/><br/>It starts in the 1800s, when Logan was a young boy a traumatic circumstance triggered his mutant abilities. It was manifest as bone-like protrusions that came out of his knuckles.<br/><br/>Then in a rather brief sequence we see Logan and his brother Victor as young adults fighting in various wars, getting wounded but always healing. It is curious, I must note, that they aged until they were adults, but then quit aging. So with this movie set in modern times they look about 40 but are in fact closer to 200 years old.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is of course Logan / Wolverine. Liev Schreiber is his brother Victor Creed. The other key character is Danny Huston as William Stryker, a role played by much older Brian Cox in X-2.<br/><br/>The story goes on to show how Logan was given an experimental treatment whereby an exotic metal went into his body to make him indestructible, and his bony protrusions were replaced by the metal blades.<br/><br/>The themes in the movie are very dark, both Logan and Victor go on killing sprees. But the movie ends in a way to set the stage for what became the X-Men movies already out."

End of the day I think the people who appreciate the back-story & origin of a film together with the history of the main character will have higher expectations from the silver screen. So to begin with I LOVED THIS MOVIE, I always read up on reviews and take in as much info on a movie before going to see it, for some reason the hype of a movie always add's to the excitement. Well I was quite surprised with the widely panned and rather negative reviews aimed at Origins. It had a better write up then Wolverine's last adventure (X-Men III) but Origins is said to be no where near X2, well I'm going to be brave and say: I thought Xmen Origins was the best of the X-men franchise to date ! The reason, you have a central character everyone enjoys sharing screen time with and a great plot, the other X-men movies play their part because they add to the nostalgia and always keep you in the mindset that you know whats going to happen to your old chum, Logan. The story follows James Logan aka Wolverine & his half brother, Victor Creed aka Sabretooth over the years. The opening montage of them both in the credits over the various wars they both fought in is absolutely brilliant. The story then takes the turn of a revenge tale, first we learn of Wolverine's recruitment along with his brother into a hit squad assembled of other troubled mutants, then when Wolverine's blood lust has succumbed & he tires of all the killings he abandons his role within the team much to the disdain of both Creed & Stryker. With Wolverine losing his beloved due to his past affiliations with the shady government agency. Wolverine continues the movie rampaging through searching for his lovers killer or killers. Emotionally scarred from his lovers loss and unable to contain his rage we learn of the infamous procedure to add adamantium to our heroes skeleton and why he is so mentally troubled. From the moment he becomes one with the magical metal alloy Adamantium, Logan searches for his revenge slaying one enemy from the next¬Öuntil he learns who is really behind the anarchy caused in his life. Two people responsible for Logan's troubles are Victor Creed who we already know about from the beginning then we slowly learn about the relationship Wolverine has with his old commander, William Stryker, who plays almost a farther figure to Wolverine & the rest of his rag/tag bunch of super-anti heroes he assembles (An almost elite hit squad would be a better name !). As wolverine fights battles with Victor as well as Stryker and his henchmen the story quickly progress's to a super climax leaving it open for a welcome sequel Many people and even well known critics have harped on the fact there are too many characters piled into the movie for commercial effect, but unlike Spiderman III which really did have character overkill. The extra's we're introduced too serve their purpose, with you never forgetting the central characters in this movie are Wolverine & Sabretooth. Gambit plays a welcome cameo and has his part in the story as does Cyclops, others like Emma Frost are a bit under used but still make a worthy point. The Blob & Wraith probably have more screen time then you'd expect but again make important performances for the story to progress. As for the most comical of the characters we're introduced to, Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, well I'll let you see the movie for that, lets just say he has his moment in the limelight and brilliantly played by Ryan Reynolds. Out of all the extra characters apart from Victor Creed, Stryker & possibly Silverfox (who is different to the comic version of Silverfox), Gambit has the most screen time and he has a decent storyline arc to the central character of Logan too. In fact the whole movie I was waiting for Gambit's appearance, when it finally did come I wasn't disappointed ! On the down side the movie is slightly too short with more time on the early years of the relationship between the two brothers (Victor & Logan) which could have padded it out a bit more, possibly a higher certification for the movie would have resulted in more carnage not child friendly fights we're witness too. But apart from that, which you can't blame 20th Century Fox for because all they can see is the $$$$$$$$$$ to be made !, the movie is great, definite repeat material and you have to stay till the end of the final credits for the usual Marvel treat they now add to all their movies For all you Wolverine fans¬Ö..Enjoy !"
"charlytully","7","4","8","4 May 2009"," Lots of action . . . but what's this about ORIGINS?
","I would prefer to see 10,000 movies and read 10 comic books, as opposed to reading 10,000 comics and watching a dozen flicks. Apparently some people have enough time on their hands to handle 10,000 titles in both formats (perhaps they were born in 1837, like Wolverine). So, after seeing X-Men #1-3, I was hoping #4--given its title and all--would do a more complete job of explaining exactly HOW all these mutants came to exist (you know, like the Marlon Brando cameo as SUPERMAN's father). However, after a quick and confusing scene in which an elementary school-aged boy kills a man who may or may not be his father, we're exposed to a hectic war montage in which this boy grows up to turn back Pickett's Charge during the American Civil War, back up Sgt. York in the trenches of WWI, land on Normandy Beach in WWII, and waste some VC in Vietnam. He does all this with his slightly older brother, who inexplicably sports a different surname (Creed, not Logan). I do not care if all these questions are answered in BING issue 687, BANG issue 1361, and BOOM, issue 26943D. Other movies based on comics have nearly always done a better job of exposition for non-fanboys than this flick (without billing themselves as primers on the brand, to boot!). About the only thing really clear in WOLVERINE is that the brothers had to leave their native Canada in order to slake their thirst for blood."
"dbborroughs","8","4","8","4 May 2009"," On its own terms its a great little action film I can't wait to see again
","The back story of Wolverine from childhood onward.<br/><br/>I don't know how much to say or what to say. I think the easiest thing to say is ""Works for me"".<br/><br/>The action is very good. The performances are up there (Liev Schreiber is excellent as Sabertooth). Its true to itself, though I sense possible problems (minor) in regard to the X-Men movies. Is it perfect? No. There are the bumps and such where things don't move smoothly. There is also a sense that the film could have used some fleshing out, but for the most part its a damn fine action film. Its a comic book come to life not a Russian novel and it behaves like the cinematic equivalent of one.<br/><br/>I know that one twist involving how Wolverine loses his memory has some fan boys having kittens, but you know what, there had to be a reason and thats as good as any especially owing to all that happens to the character.<br/><br/>I had a blast. I can't wait for the home video version with extras.<br/><br/>Worth a look with a bucket of popcorn and a soda.<br/><br/>Its not the best comic movie but it is an entertaining one.(if you want more than that its only because you've been spoiled by Ironman, Hulk, Batman and Hellboy- It pales compared to them, but then again most things will.)"

","Okay, I have read some pretty nasty comments but I don't understand why you are saying these things. Okay, you might be a die hard fan of the comic book and it might be a little different story but for me who hasn't read it, and don't really care about following every line of the comic book and just go because it is entertainment, I really enjoyed it! I am sure there will be people to slam me down here and I guess that is the price you pay for writing a comment, but overall people if you are looking for a bit of action entertainment and you enjoyed the first two Xmen, this movie is just as good - it is different as most characters are new, but for me I didn't care. The average rating on IMDb proves that the movie is worthwhile seeing and then make up your own mind."
"ferreira0665","6","4","8","1 May 2009"," The movie wasn't that bad...Actually thought it was pretty good
","The movie did feel rushed but there were many things I liked.<br/><br/>The credits sequence at the beginning. It was very quickly rounding up to meeting William Stryker which I thought was well done.<br/><br/>I think the escaping from the actual facility should have been longer but the action sequences that followed immediately after it made up for it.<br/><br/>It was darker than previous x-men films.<br/><br/>I did like the brothers storyline between Wolverine and Sabretooth. It did seem kind of like how brothers would act. Only I can kick your ass but when you need help I am there for you but don't expect me to stick around after. They still don't get along but it was well done.<br/><br/>I thought Gambit was great. So his eyes turn red when he is doing his powers instead of all the time. Oh well. That wasn't so bad. I didn't like his accent changing back and forth to where partly Cajun to nothing. But the way Taylor Kitsh portrayed him otherwise was spot on. I don't know where people were saying they gave him telekinesis and running on walls. He ran up the walls and kicked off them. So what? A Gambit solo movie with this actor portraying him would be awesome.<br/><br/>My major gripe is the ending about how Wolverine loses his memory. If you have a 300+ person in midair coming at you, a shot from a gun isn't going to make him go head over heels. If anything Wolverine would have landed on him. It would have probably been better to go with the original idea for him losing him memory. <br/><br/>Sabretooth...done great as well. I honestly would like to see his origin story too.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was good. It was rushed. But good."
"janyeap","8","4","8","1 May 2009"," It's a study about the animal savagery instincts vs the gentile human qualities!
","Who exactly is Wolverine? Oh yes, I was hoping to see a solid story in which Director Gavin Hood leaves no stones unturned to bring out a stunning, astoundingly memorable character growth and character expansion of Hugh Jackman's iconic Wolverine, not seen on screen before. I wasn't disappointed. Even the events and twist involving Silver Fox are nicely rolled into the tale to support Logan/Wolverine's motivations. Do I care that Silver Fox is seen to have a tactile mind control ability rather than accelerated healing factor? Not really as the creative change works beautifully for this film. Her presence in this film is a vital part of the inner struggle between the Logan/Wolverine's animal savagery instincts and the Logan/Wolverine's noble human qualities. <br/><br/>We do get a little bit more of Wolverine's past, a past that flows back to 1845, building on a brief, but satisfying introduction to the relationship and sibling rivalry between him (James Howlett) and his troublesome half brother, Victor, and then onwards to their involvement in various war- whew, I sure did have a jolly good time identifying the four historical American wars! But as events move to Logan's mercenary involvement in the Weapon X project and with General Stryker, the scenes start to get more and more thrilling as the raging Wolverine faces deceit, betrayal, revenge, empowerment...and the loss of memory. Okay, there's relatively nothing ultra new about Jackman's Wolverine that X-Men comic book fans don't know, but, boy, oh boy, never have I seen Hugh Jackman going so super-energized and so fabulously athletic in a film... and so constantly highlighting his shirtless, well-preserved, sexy physique! And I'm especially pleased that his Wolverine has more character depth in this film. It's definitely compelling to watch his changing behaviors at each stage of his metamorphosis. Whoa, watch him growl and howl in rage...yep, a dark character, but never losing his charismatic charm! The most striking moments for me are when the opposing traits and sentiments come into conflicting play between the two brothers. Oh yes, Liev Schreiber is picture perfect and very credible as Sabretooth! Whoa, Jackman and Schreiber are indeed a dynamic duo in this film! Danny Huston, too, succeeds in bringing out the devious and villainous William Stryker. And as befitting its title, this film does not fail to deliver the many familiar X-men mutants in this film...hhhmmh, Deadpool, Gambit, Wraith, Cyclops, Mystique, Storm, Ice Man having made the list. Hey, surely no X-Men film can be complete without at least a cameo appearance of the most celebrated promoter of the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights? Although there are some rather interesting lines of dialogue, expressing clear political as well as social observation, the dialogue, overall, is rather clunky. And while some of the fight scenes are very impressive, they tend to loose their appeal with the over-repetitive takes. Some also feel too far-fetched. The chase and the slow-mo explosion scenes? These may be considered as clich√©d, over-used, and almost obligatory, but I'm not displeased with those seen here. The cutting-edge special effects and stunt razzmatazz are outrageously spectacular, working well with the story's elements and to offer non-stop actions for inciting the audience's visceral reactions. Besides, it'd be foolhardy to think that we all aren't thrilled to see villains being blown to smithereens in films! <br/><br/>Overall, I was happily entertained. And I did stay to see the post-credit 'bar' scene, too."
"konya-s","4","6","14","30 April 2009"," My God! That was really BAD!
","I mean BAD! No kidding, this movie is on par with Ghost Rider. Not awful, but one of the weakest comic book movies ever made. And you know what? I loved the X-Men movies. I love the comic books (the Chris Claremont-series), and of course Wolverine is one of my favorites character. He's badass, cool, and mean son-of-a-b*tch. He doesn't't f*ckin' around. Don't get me wrong, in the previous X-Men flicks I really liked Hugh Jackman's performance as Logan. He was great. But the difference is that those movies had a great director. A director who can handle the entire mythology, who gave us a faithful comic book adaption. Now we have Gavin Hood. He doesn't have a clue what's going on in this universe. He doesn't know who is Wolverine, he doesn't understand the character, etc. Of course the action scenes are not so bad, the final action is pretty good I say, but that's just not enough. Remember Brian Cox from the X2? He was an awesome Stryker! Danny Huston is just...Well...He's bad. I wanted to slap him in the face, but not in a good way. Brian Cox was the devil but Danny Huston was pretty lame. Liev as Sabertooth was pretty good, though. So what? Didn't change anything. Oh and for f*ck's sake, what the hell is Cyclops doing in this movie? And how the hell got his glasses before he met Xavier? It's just plain damn lame. The opening scene sucks too. So why I gave this movie 4/10? Good question! Maybe didn't worth that much, but I can't entirely hate it. You know Gambit was a cool guy in this picture. Cool, but not enough screen time. Damn! Not a very good picture, but not as bad as Catwoman. That's something, heh?"
"brando647","5","5","11","21 September 2009"," Fox Botches Another Marvel Adaptation
","All right. Seriously, 20th Century Fox needs to throw in the towel and give up on comic book movies. The X-MEN trilogy had a decent run (and X2 is one of my favorite comic adaptations) but every other attempt has ended in mediocrity or failure. Their WOLVERINE spin-off is no different; it teeters on the edge of both. The movie attempts to fill in film audiences on the history of everyone's favorite member of the X-Men, including how he acquired his adamantium claws and his amnesia. Somehow, that equates to an uninteresting story with the usual Fox mutant cameo-fest. When will they learn? I've read a bit of Wolverine's origin story in the comics and was a bit upset that they crammed his childhood into a four-minute opening sequence. They've also taken some annoying creative license with the details of Weapon X and Wolverine's team members, about which I wasn't too thrilled. Lack of faith to the source material aside, I can still enjoy a comic book movie as long as it's entertaining enough. Sadly, this movie didn't fit the bill. The story was unimpressive and never really grabbed me and some of the plot devices were just ridiculous (adamantium bullets...really?!). As has become the norm, Fox included an abundance of unjustifiable character cameos, just for the sake of having them: Gambit, Cyclops, Blob, etc. None of these characters were necessary but they felt the need to include them anyway, which I feel detracts from the story.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, the film is hit-or-miss. Jackman did a great job as usual in the title role; he really appears to have embraced the character and I wish they'd given him better material to work with. I absolutely LOVED Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed/Sabretooth! I feel as if he did a better job of making a solid character of him than Tyler Mane did in the original film. As pointless as I felt the character's inclusion was, I felt Taylor Kitsch did a good job in the role of Gambit and I'm hoping he gets some stronger material in the future and a chance to develop the role. Danny Huston was decent as General Styker though I still prefer Brian Cox. And, of course, there's Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool; he always would've been my first choice for the character and he does a great job for the measly 5 minutes we get of him.<br/><br/>For a blockbuster movie that came out nine years since the original, I have to question the poor CGI. There are too many moments in this movie when it just looked terrible and pulled you out of the film. Come on now, Wolverine's been in three previous movies...we STILL haven't perfected his claws?! Honestly, the lame outweighs the good for the first X-Men spin-off and it doesn't bode well for the future. The 107 minute runtime feels as if it takes forever and the movie frequently grinds to a halt. With as much bank as the film pulled in, a sequel is inevitable. Let's just hope they learn from their mistakes and Wolverine's next solo outing does the character, and Marvel, justice."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not without its flaws and although some things are left unexplained, it is nowhere near as bad as critics are cracking it up to be. At the end of the day, it is a very fun roller coaster ride from beginning to end and personally, I enjoyed every second of it. Hugh Jackman did not disappoint, as I knew he would not as Wolverine and his true dark side is finally shown as in the films it was really dumbed down. I was very impressed by his performance. Liev Schreiber who plays Wolverine's half brother - Victor Creed - was far better than I expected. He was cruel, ruthless and merciless, just how you would expect Sabretooth to behave and act in say, the comics. <br/><br/>Taylor Kitsch was very impressive as Gambit and did not disappoint at all which was a relief. His accent is there at times and although his red eyes are only shown once, I did not mind. It is great just to see Gambit in a movie! I would love to see Taylor reprise his role as Gambit again in future X-Men movies and sequels; the same goes for Deadpool who was also superb although I expect a lot of Deadpool fans will be disappointed due to his and Gambit's lack of screen time and characterisation. Deadpool does not don the classic red and black costume but hey, what can I say? This movie is called X-Men Origins: Wolverine for a reason, not X-Men Origins: Gambit or X-Men Origins: Deadpool!<br/><br/>This film has plenty of action and plenty of explosions! You need not be bored! The CGI and special effects are not brilliant and for a film of this modern age, they could have certainly been better but don't let that put you off! It is loaded with action, drama and plenty of sexy men for us ladies to feast our eyes on! What more could a woman ask for? Surprisingly, there is no to barely any blood and the violence, although good, is very lighthearted and very much left to the imagination. The fight scenes between Wolverine and Sabretooth, although short, were very entertaining and are sure to please fans. Be prepared for plenty of roaring because they do a lot of it in this movie! May I say this film also has plenty of humour and laugh-out-loud moments that make you feel good. Some scenes, specifically the opening credits and adamantium-infusion scene totally took my breath away and were incredibly well done. Do yourself a favour and judge this film for yourself. Do not listen to the critics. It may not be as good as X-Men 2 but I assure you it is well worth your time. 8/10."

","The early years of James Logan people, featuring his rivalry with his brother Victor Creed, his service in the special forces team Weapon X, and his experimentation into the metal-lined mutant Wolverine.<br/><br/>I have seen worse superhero movies. Batman and Robin, Electra, The Green Hornet, Man of Steel, X Men: Apocalypse. Yes. this is not even the worst X Men film i find. However Origins does feel like a mediocre matinee picture instead of the latest instalment of a series that had been going on for nearly a decade at the time of it's release.<br/><br/>I was expecting more cringe comedy, more nonsensical action sequences, more laughably boilerplate dialogue. My expectations were too low really. I do remember this film kicking up a storm amongst critics back in the day and i guess the massive disappointment of X Men The Last Stand had a lot to do with that. But right now, it all seems so quaint. Yes, there is some cringy slapstick and CGI that has not definitely stood the test of time. However, apart from that, everything is just mediocre in that typical X Men way. Although Scott Atkins' makeup does look really stupid in this. He deserved better.<br/><br/>I guess that was the source of the discontent, that Origins is very average and very Hollywood, ie very cliche. People were expecting more and if i was into X Men, i guess i would be the same. But i didn't have that connection and all i saw was a fantasy action film that cost way more than it should have, but just went along at a fine click, logic be damned, and just simply has that Seagal film effect. It's either tolerable or laughable and Origins is between that. X Men Apocalypse was near twice as long and twice as dumb i find.<br/><br/>It's a weak defence, but it's a defence nonetheless. Origins works as a direct to video action film. For many, that was the problem. For me, there is schlock to be enjoyed here. At times, it's narrative is muddled and has too many characters and i did i tune out, however i feel that Origins is quick enough with it's pace and laughable enough with its treatment of it's I.P to appeal to both Hollywood action film junkies and anti-superhero film fans alike. An odd bunch to pair , but there you go. At least it wasn't Apocalypse."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is notorious for the wrong reasons. It is by far the most hated X-Men film and even an apologist of X-Men 3, such as yours truly, has no trouble seeing why it has earned its none too arousing rep.<br/><br/>First of all, I believe this film is proof that it is possible to ""mis-cast"" a director. Gavin Hood, who knocked it out of the park with his Oscar-winning 2005 drama Tsotsi, was alien to the genre of action at the time he directed X-Men Origins. As of 2013's Ender's Game, he has become more comfortable with the genre and visibly capable of crafting a competent action film. X-Men Origins, I can assure you, is nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>In it, we get to know the origins of adamantium-boned, immortal mutant Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). We see how he killed his own father after his real father killed his step-father whom he first thought was his real father. Are you still with me? Good. So, he runs away from home with his brother Victor ""Sabretooth"" Creed, played by Liev Schreiber as an adult and not remotely similar to Tyler Mane in the first X-Men. Together they use their immortality and healing factor - Sabretooth's got 'em too - to fight several wars and eventually attract the attention of one Major William Stryker (Danny Huston). Not sure if he looks much of anything like Brian Cox's version of the character in X-Men 2.<br/><br/>Wolverine and Sabretooth fight more battles alongside Stryker's top secret team of super mutants, but Wolverine eventually ends up wanting no part in it. Hence why he moves into a cottage in the mountains with Lynn Collins and starts calling himself ""Logan"". But then Collins is killed by Sabretooth. Wolverine gets angry. Wolverine gets adamantium put in his bones by Stryker. Wolverine goes to a farmhouse and reinacts Superman's origin story with some old couple. Old couple gets killed by Stryker's agents. Wolverine tracks down his old friends from Stryker's team. Wolverine meets Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), a respectlessly shoehorned in mutant who charges everything he touches, especially his trusty deck of cards, into bombs. Gambit and Wolverine battle pointlessly. Gambit helps Wolverine track down Stryker. Again I ask: are you still with me?<br/><br/>Wolverine's old team, besides Sabretooth, consists of Kevin Durand as some guy who later becomes The Blob for some reason, Dominic Monaghan as a walking battery, will.i.am as some rapper who thinks he can act, Daniel Henney as Agent Zero, and Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson, who later becomes Deadpool, at which point his trademark katanas are put inside (!) his arms and his mouth is stitched shut. If you're gonna make a film based on a character known for his fast mouth and your first instinct is to sew it shut, why are you even permitted to try?<br/><br/>Many of these characters feel like they're present only for the sake of fanservice, but how much fanservice is it to give beloved X-Men characters like Gambit so little to do and to get Deadpool so breathtakingly wrong? Not even Wolverine's claws get much respect in that they in many shots look as though they were made in an hour using Adobe After Effects. The action scenes and accompanying visuals are often equally unwatchable.<br/><br/>A late scene also involves the puzzling appearance of Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. He is seen standing upright, something he, according to X-Men: First Class, lost the ability to do when he was as young as James McAvoy. For some reason, fans seem to point this plot hole out more commonly than they point out the one in X-Men 3, in which Xavier and Magneto are shown as friends in a flashback where they're still played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, in spite of them having become enemies when they were still James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender.<br/><br/>I understand that the makers of X-Men Origins couldn't very well know in advance what the makers of First Class and Days of Future Past had in mind, but I do wish there was better consistency in-between films. How much do you wanna bet that if George Lucas made these movies, he would re-release X-Men 3 and X-Men Origins on Blu-Ray, having re-shot Xavier and Magneto's flashback scenes with James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender? I strangely find myself welcoming it.<br/><br/>But I agree with the fanboys and fangirls that the less we say about X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the better. It is a clumsy, idiotic and unattractive film that makes me want to give Gambit a pat on the back and Deadpool a massive hug and a cigar. Wolverine, I think, will be fine."
"TheMovieDiorama","3","2","3","1 January 2019"," X-Men Origins: Wolverine shreds its source material into little tiny pieces.
","Oooof. Kids, this is why we can't have nice things. When a franchise gains continued success, the studio believe they can do no wrong. Well, this pointless atrocity is the perfect example in disproving that belief. It's not all doom and gloom for Logan, as there are a few good aspects. But the obscene amount of disrespect to its comic book origins is a heinous crime. Chronicling the early life of Logan and how he obtained his adamantium exoskeleton, he undergoes a quest for vengeance against Sabretooth who murdered the love of his life. I appreciate the darker narrative as it allows more grit and unpredictable actions to take place (y'know, like killing innocent old people in a barn). Jackman and Schreiber deserve better, considering they both gave decent performances. And when Jackman screams in fits of pure rage, I do get the tingles. But God flipping damn what was this!? It's one thing to deviate from the source material, it's a complete different thing to then change the origins of the protagonist that were depicted in a previous instalment ('X2' did it better). Wolverine didn't need this film. As a character, he was hugely developed in the original trilogy. There wasn't much more room for growth. The emotional resonance that was forced upon Wolverine, in an attempt to make audiences empathise with him, was a good aspect. Yet, the final scene which closely resembles a ""it was just a dream"" plot device, neglects everything that was shoddily developed beforehand! Making the whole ordeal unnecessary. We learnt nothing. It's just another X-Men film with different mutants. Gambit was pushed in at the last second. There's a stupid boxing scene with Blob. A cowboy Will.i.am (of all people!) ""acted"" so poorly that it made me want to ""Scream & Shout"". Then there is Deadpool or Weapon X or whatever. The merc with the mouth, with his mouth...sewn shut. Poor editing during action scenes. Horrific use of visual effects and noticeable green screens. And an airbrushed Charles Xavier! No wonder Jackman hated the final cut..."

The background story, for those not as familiar with the comics, is a well portrayed version of one of the darker character stories in the comic book world, and shows why the character from the X-men movies is one of the more emotionally complex. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is mainly an action movie without pretending to be much more, but a relatively enjoyable one overall."

","I'm going to be honest here - I don't think I've seen the movie everyone else is complaining about. I didn't mind the movie. I admit, I have fallen behind on my comic reading in past years but the plot holes of the movie and between the movies is insignificant compared to the plot holes of the comics.<br/><br/>That being said, it's not high art or anything like that.<br/><br/>I guess my only complaint is the depiction of Deadpool.

","People say this is the worst superhero film, but it's actually very good. The movie just tells about Wolverines past, and how he got the metal claws from William Stryker to avenge his girlfriend, Kayla, and fight his brother that killed her, Victor Creed, (aka Sabertooth) who has claws that defiantly can kill. It also explains how Victor hunts down the old team Stryker brought together, and later separates after Wolverine leaves the group. You see how Wade Wilson is created into Deadpool, and gets many mutants powers, including Wolverine, and then fights Wolverine( It turns out Stryker was telling Creed to do these things by the way). When Wolverine gets shot in the head twice, he loses his memory, and that's how you see why Wolverine couldn't remember his mysterious past. When Kayla turns out to be alive and gets shot, then dies for real, Wolverine doesn't remember her or anything else that ever happened. I say it's a great movie, and is very interesting to watch."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009): Dir: Gavin Hood / Cast: Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Danny Huston, Lynn Collins: Comic book spin off on identity. It regards Wolverine's background as a mutant and his rage after his wife is murdered and his escape from an organization that does experiments on mutants. Structured with nearly constant action and violence. Directed by Gavin Hood with explosive special effects. Hugh Jackman plays off Wolverine's desire for solitude as oppose to the reality set before him. He spends much of the film in combat where his bladed knuckles come into play. Liev Schreiber plays his evil half brother who is a broader character than at first seems. When Wolverine refuses to join the organization, Schreiber is forced to eliminate him. Ryan Reynolds plays a key mutant skilled in sword play and who factors into the story entirely different from his opening. Lynn Collins plays Wolverine's Native American girlfriend who also comes equipped with her own special powers so that dating conversation would have common ground. Only Danny Huston is flat as Stryker who seeks Wolverine's services. He is the standard villain who barks orders and makes threats but little else. After the success of the X-Men franchise the studio isolates Wolverine due to popularity amongst comic book fans. The film does just that and celebrates Wolverine for die hard fanatics.

I loved the flashbacks of them during all the different world wars they fought in and their ultimate reliance on each other. <br/><br/>There's a bit of a love story, and then the reasons behind Wolverine's metal claws.

","As an FYI, I am writing this review with a vague background of Wolverine's true origins - thus, I'm not writing this review as an angry fan but as a passive viewer. The story of Wolverine has always been an intriguing one. Viewers of previous X-Men films can see that there are a lot of unanswered questions when it comes to his character, and his story is certainly a special one.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine delivers. Beautiful visuals. Stunning special effects. Fight scenes that seem to be taken directly out of Mortal Kombat. Marvel never seems to fail me in that respect. <br/><br/>We are taken through the centuries as we find out who Wolverine is and why he is the way he is. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is a little bit different than in other X-Men films - we truly see his humanistic and protective nature through in this film, especially with Sabretooth (Victor Creed)as his character foil. <br/><br/>All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable film in my opinion. As I get back into watching the TV Series adaptation and do more research into the comics, I will be better able to compare, however as of now, I'm quite impressed."

","With all three x men films it was clear that Wolverine was the main character and that with this Fox thought it was a good idea to do a prequel for their loved character and even though I don't believe this film is as bad as some suggest it is not as good as other x men films by far. This film looks to Logan's past and history with William Stryker and Sabertooth. Now this film has some good parts with the extreme action between Wolverine and Sabertooth and the performances of Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber. There are also the introduction of great X-men characters such as Gambit and a horrific version of Deadpool. The main negatives is just the dialogue and the film just feels choppy and sloppy throughout plus it like most of the x-men films is inconsistent with the other X men films which just feels lazy. The action is good Wolverine fun but that is about the only positive in this dull action film."

The plot wears very thin very quickly. The special effects looked cheesy and cheap. The action sequences were unbelievable and silly. Wolverine performs physically impossible feats, i mean even considering his mutation. Logan vs the hummer anyone. The movie was also filled to capacity with useless characters whose only purpose was to tell wolverine how to get from point a to point b. Oh and by far the stupidest part of the movie was when gambit stops wolverine from killing victor just so we could have an action sequence involving gambit.

","As with Terminator Salvation, I heard and read a lot of negative things about X-Men Origins: Wolverine but having watched the film it surprised me in how entertaining it was. The action was always enjoyable to watch and the characters always kept me interested. Sure this is not as good as X2 but this succeeds in keeping the audience entertained. <br/><br/>As the film began I had a bad feeling that this would be terrible as the script was awful where we are introduced to Wolverine and Sabertooth when they were younger. The scene was really bad but thankfully the credits sequence begins where we see the two brothers fighting in various wars before they then meet General Stryker. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman always puts himself into his roles and he does it again here. While the script could have provided him with more to do, what he does do, he does well. The supporting cast are also good to watch including Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston. However it is Ryan Reynolds who steels the film as Deadpool despite having a very limited screen time. <br/><br/>What makes this film better than X-Men 3 was that this never becomes dull; there is always something happening such as an action sequence or a new character being introduced. <br/><br/>The script may not be perfect and what the film does with some of the characters will anger fans but this does improve over the last X-Men film. I can only hope that X-Men: First Class has a better script. However the action is fun and frantic, Wolverine is likable and the villains are entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>Do not expect the next Batman Begins or Iron Man out this film because the origins of Wolverine are not very well told but that is not to say that it is not worth watching."

","This movie was never as great and awesome as people had hoped it to be but simple fact is that this is some quality entertainment nevertheless.<br/><br/>This is the first spin-off movie from the popular X-Men movie series, with Wolverine in the lead. It at the same time is also a prequel to all of the X-men movies. Wolverine has always been one of the most popular and rich characters, not only in the movie but also with the comic book fans and those who watched one of the many cartoons based on the X-Men on TV. So it's no big surprise really that Wolverine was the first of the X-Men to get a movie of his own.<br/><br/>It's also the movie role that Hugh Jackman seems to be born for. It's the perfect part for him and was also the character that launched him to stardom with the first X-Men movie of 2000. No wonder that he was eager to jump on to this project and even became a producer himself for it.<br/><br/>Expectations were always quite high for this movie but those expectations got never really met for anyone. It was an highly anticipated movie because it featured the popular character of Wolverine and promised to feature plenty of action in it.<br/><br/>The movie never really becomes as great as you would had hoped. Reason for this is that the story feels quite rushed and messy. The story really seems like an excuse to let Wolverine battle as many different mutants as possible, without letting those moments ever make sense for the story. It's pretty pointless all how this movie its story is often progressing and doesn't really seem to go anywhere in terms of telling something new. I mean, this is an origins story but we pretty much knew already how Wolverine came to be Wolverine in ""X2"".<br/><br/>So all of the actions seems pretty random and pointless for the story, it still keeps the movie going and is what makes it still interesting and entertaining to watch. It's a big budget movie and that shows with its action moments. There are plenty of effects here that most of the time are pretty good looking.<br/><br/>By no means a great movie but there is basically no way that you'll not enjoy watching it.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Gavin Hood directed this fourth entry in the series, a prequel focusing on the origins of Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) which begins with him and his half-brother Victor Creed(played by Live Schreiber) as children, both mutants who are forced to leave home and rely on each other as they live vicariously through every subsequent human war, as their healing abilities make them perfect soldiers. After a failed firing squad during Vietnam brings them to the attention of a young William Stryker(played by Danny Huston) who builds an elite team of mutants to do special ops missions, but Wolverine becomes fed up, and leaves. Six years later, his past catches up with him, as Logan/Wolverine must confront his past if he is to have a future, but events will conspire against him in many ways, even though he remains a true survivor.

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>It seems that this prequel has gotten mostly negative reviews and those who didn't have a mixed reaction to it either downright hated every second of it or simply wished that they had never viewed it. I personally don't see why the film has so much venom aimed at it because even though it's flawed there's still enough here to make it worth watching. What we've basically got is a film that gives us the backstory to how Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) came to be who he is. You'd think that with a plot like this you'd get some character development or at least really learn a lot about him but in fact you don't. Perhaps this is where some of the hatred comes from because you really don't get to learn too much about Wolverine other than a sequence in front of the credits. The credit sequence features Wolverine and Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) going through various wars in American history and I must admit that this here was the best part of the film. It actually made me wish the entire film dealt with the way these two men were involved in these real life events. However, that's not the case and what we're left with is the two of them constantly battling one another while various others around them get involved, get killed or reveal some sort of secret. For the most part I thought the film was entertaining enough to make it worth sitting through and there's certainly no doubt that Jackman owns the role by this point. I also thought Schreiber was extremely good as was Danny Huston and Ryan Reynolds. I do wonder why Wolverine and the Wade Wilson character are constantly stabbing people yet their blades contain no blood."

I love a dumb action film, but this was just too dumb.<br/><br/>Jackman is comfortable in the role of Wolverine, helped by a big pay cheque.

But puns aside and if you don't care that much about this being made PG-13 (the new Wolverine will have an R or unrated version released after its theatrical run), than you might be able to enjoy this Origin story.<br/><br/>This comes down to Hugh Jackmans passion and drive. While he does act in musicals and plays too, he is able to be convincing in his action roles. The game based on this movie has much more blood in it. The story is not overwhelming, but it does do the trick. I hope the next one can be better though. It's also a shame that they did recast (L.

The supporting cast is amazing as well. I wouldn't be surprised if Liev Schreiber, Taylor Kitsch, and Danny Huston all receive Best Supporting Actor nods. Liev Schrieber's performance is up there with Al Pacino's Michael Corleone. Of course, Gavin Hood deserves Best Director and the screenplay should be honored too.

They were stupid in the comic book and they're stupid in a movie. Not to mention they're all knobby ugly for no good reason. They looked like three hobbit walking sticks coming out of each hand.<br/><br/>Any surgeon watching the adamantium bonding sequence should be cringing at how ridiculously simple it was. And anyone with two IQ points to rub together should be wondering how Logan's claws came out all smooth and sharp when the originals were just pointy and knobby.<br/><br/>The love story is lame and uninspired, sad considering the events surrounding it were the only motivation for any of the actions taken by the main character in the entire film.<br/><br/>The introduction of Wade Wilson at the beginning of the film made me wish I was watching a Deadpool movie instead. At least he was fun to listen to.<br/><br/>Gambit was a high point, though his mysteriously fading accent was annoying as was his lets-stick-a-popular-character-in-for-no-reason appearance.<br/><br/>Sigh, I could nitpick the entire film and to avoid spoilers I can't complain about HOW STUPID THE END WAS. Yes, X3 is now the second worst mutant movie after XMO:W. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh! I give it 3 stars because that's what it deserves. Ma and Pa Kent were enjoyable. Some of the action was cool.

The fight goes on for literally about 45 seconds and then it's all over. Overall this movie isn't the worst movie of all time but it's definitely the worst movie to have wolverine in it.

","It's not just that this movie is more filled with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the trilogy, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. Wolverine starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase ""summer movie."" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. (I'm sure Transformers 2 will give us plenty of that later in the summer.) But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that mutant super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. The movie delivers enough story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. This movie and the action are just plain spectacular.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this film is that virtually no screen time is spent on background character development. Like with last year's Incredible Hulk, the opening credits serve as a cool update and feeder for a basic origin. Even the newer characters that are introduced get very little time devoted to their past and it all works quite well. People in general are smart and can read between the lines, thus negating the necessity for cumbersome background information. Apparently the director figured this out and doesn't ""talk down"" to his audience even though it's an action film. The pace flows smoothly, with hardly a stutter along the way to break up the story or the action. That's the key. As good as X2 was, Wolverine simply has better action without sacrificing the heart or character development or the emotion that made this franchise the juggernaut that it has turned out to be.<br/><br/>This movie stands on its own, as its own Wolverine. People who've never seen any of the other movies can go and see it and enjoy it. I saw it with two people that have never seen any X-Men stuff and they loved it. One of the year's best."

Unlike other Origin films of late (Batman) was a re-launch of the series and didn't really have to worry about messing up the story lines of other films.<br/><br/>with Origins-Wolverine being a Prequel to the X-Series it had some issues.With the main antagonists of the film being victor/saber tooth & Styker, whom we know make it through to the X-Series movies there was no real tension for me. From the beginning of the movie i know they would escape/flee in someway. The use of Weapon X and that fight wasn't really are great way for closure as the character himself is introduced to action so late in the movie.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog is also a bit hard to stomach, at times characters felt as if they were explaining things for no other reason as to make the film make sense, it wasn't natural. <br/><br/>(Spoiler) I lost it when Stryker sends agent Zero out to hunt down wolverine, who fails. The film then cuts back to Stryker who seems to have a revelation of (not actual line but this is what it felt like) ""should of given him the gun with the anamantium bullets....whoops""<br/><br/>But it is this same writing that makes the film feel sloppy.<br/><br/>In conclusion the action sequences were good, can't complain about them, but the story, dialog and suspense just didn't work"

So while all the popular complaints thrown at the film regarding Deadpool, Gambit, Emma Frost, Cyclops, etc. do irk me a bit they were by no means a deal breaker. All conflicts over film vs. source material aside, this just isn't a well made movie. Period.<br/><br/>After a seemingly irrelevant first scene (seriously... tell me the point. Where was the payoff later?) there's an even more ludicrous opening credits sequence that while fun to look at it carries very little emotional weight. Nothing's at stake. There's no motivation for any of it in play. Do these guys just like blowing stuff up and killing that much? On the surface the changes they made to the Wolverine/Sabretooth relationship make sense. One character embracing his animal instincts and the other fighting them is a cool dynamic. But it's not one that's ever really allowed to play out in a satisfying way. Wolverine never comes close to the edge. There's no moment where we think he might give in and compromise his humanity. There have been traces of that trademark ""berzerker rage"" smattered throughout these films but they were teases at best. The real Wolverine has yet to show up in a movie. And here was a story begging for him. One free from the baggage of previous installments. They could have done something reminiscent of Clint Eastwood in The Man With No Name trilogy. But no, it's just our usual huggable, soft, family friendly Wolverine. He's less threatening here then he was in the trilogy. At least then he had the mystique of an unknown past. This movie's biggest revelation? The X-Men's ""baddest"" member is really a bit of a softie.<br/><br/>Stryker's black ops team is brimming with potential but don't get too attached to these guys. Look, I get it. The movie's called Wolverine. There wasn't room to tell all their stories. So why include them at all? Don't show an audience how potentially awesome a Ryan Reynolds Deadpool movie would be and then be surprised when they cry fowl for ditching him five minutes later. Same goes for Gambit. Why keep crowding the story with more mutants when there's barely enough time to flesh out the two we're supposed to care about? The Weapon X scene has a few moments that cause a genuine stir but honestly it was handled so much better in X2. There it seemed dirty and scary and dangerous.<br/><br/>And it just keeps getting worse the more the plot tries to advance itself. Ridiculous double crosses and plot twists ensue and pretty soon we reach an out of left field climax that provides a silly deus ex machina for Wolverine's memory loss and supremely unsatisfying ending for our bad guys.<br/><br/>To be fair, Liev Schreiber does a lot with very little. He seems to be having a lot more fun with his character than anyone else. And while there's still no explanation for how Victor became the caveman Sabretooth was in X1 I really did enjoy his performance. And as I mentioned before, Ryan Reynolds was great even if he was essentially the same character he played in Blade: Trinity. His action scene was also the only one that got a smile out of me. Although the thought of these guys riding up in the elevator on their top secret mission still makes me laugh.<br/><br/>Look, I don't mind the idea of more Origins movies or even another Wolverine movie. As long as they make as much of an effort on the basic premise as they did trying to figure out how to shoe horn a bunch of cameos into this one. The bulk of my disappointment rests squarely on the script.<br/><br/>Iron Man and The Dark Knight showed us we don't have to accept the old ""pretty good for a comic book movie"" attitude. These can be great films period. Wolverine is not. And there's no excuse for that."
"mrohlee","3","5","12","4 May 2009"," Another example of too much focus on CGI
","There was one reviewer who said that this seems like a Steven Segal movie made in the 1980s. I think that is pretty accurate with $150 mil of CGI thrown on top of it. The CGIs are great but you come out feeling blah about the whole thing. After the studios butchered one of the first Tarzan movies Edgar Rice Burroughs told them they could do anything they wanted with Tarzan as long as it had nothing to do with any of his actual stories. I agree with him. Either stick to the story as written (and why not since it's been popular for 20 years) or just make up something completely new. Trying to twist things around so that they sort of fit just doesn't improve the situation at all.<br/><br/>The actors are all pretty decent. The movie starts with a pretty strange sequence and then flips into the war montage that I had been looking forward to. I thought they would use this to explain the characters a little more fully but basically what you see in the trailers is all there is.<br/><br/>So where is the blood thirsty Wolverine we had expected? I thought the back story was going to set that up but other than he seemed to like being in combat they didn't show it. I had hoped his girl friend/common law wife would be Japanese but no, there is no conflict with the Samurai type anti-western father.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds seems wasted in a small part. The Blob was one of my favorite villains in the comics but here I don't know what he is. Some really strong guy with an eating disorder rather than a mutant who cannot be moved.<br/><br/>No explanation of why/how Sabertooth turns into the character in X-men part 1.<br/><br/>One of the real let downs was the cameo of Professor X at the end of the movie. He shows up just to give some of the mutants a helicopter ride in the last 5 minutes. So he knew what was going on there the whole time but just shows up then why? I have no idea, it just seems tacked on for no reason.<br/><br/>If you have never read any of the comics and want some mindless CGI filled action movie you might enjoy this. Other than that, don't get your hopes up."

","X-men 3 was so dire and so the only way this could go was up for me but it will be a long time before they bring the standard back up to that of the first two movies.<br/><br/>The mistake that Hollywood and a lot of TV in general make these days is lack of character development. They want to see a half dozen characters thrown into different situations and they want it all done in one movie. How can you feel any form of loss for a character if you have no connection with them?<br/><br/>Was it a bad movie?<br/><br/>No, it just wasn't a good movie. You don't come away feeling like you were there. You don't feel a part of the movie like you might have with the first or second. The great thing about X-men 1 was that they showed various characters but it was in passing, they might be sat in a class room and using their abilities just so you can point and go Ah! that's who that is.<br/><br/>But here they try to apply those characters willy nilly and a lot of questions start to pop up.<br/><br/>Here is a spoiler but a good example of poor forward planning. At one point its suggested that shooting wolverine through the head will kill him or take him out of the equation. Yet knowing this they send ""Agent Zero"", a character who has perfect marksmanship at incredible range, to face Wolverine without these adamantium bullets? They even mention that its pretty much a suicide run for agent zero, yet if he's their best shot at taking him out then why waste him?<br/><br/>Surely that's just common sense, we can only kill him with these bullets, well lets give these bullets to the incredible marksman then.<br/><br/>Its an OK movie, its on par with the original hulk movie or Dare Devil. It deserves to be rated higher for the action sequences alone but poor script writing lets this movie down.<br/><br/>Watch it when it comes out on Sky, don't bother seeing it at the cinema"

","I have no bad comment for this movie, because it's awesome. The special effects were really nice made, and I was excited the whole movie. Basically it's Wolverine, but with his whole back-story. <br/><br/>As we probably all know, Wolverine is a mutant who joined the X-Men. What most of us don't know is what happened before he joined. You see how he found out about his powers, and you see him grow up and get to know a lot of his past. I didn't even know that he was immortal. That's because I never read Marvel comics, but that's not the point. The point is that it reveals a lot of things most of us X-Men fans don't even know. How his claws got from bone to adamantium, even when he got a girlfriend (or wife, I forgot), but who is really a spy, etc.<br/><br/>It's a real pleasure to watch this, with all the action and drama, and sometimes a bit of comedy. I recommend this one for those who like to see Wolverine's past, and of course the X-Men fans."
"vlefs","3","4","9","1 June 2009"," X-Men needs a reboot.
","I hated this movie. I tried very hard to like it. But I reached a point about 40 minutes into it that I simply did not care to watch the rest. I did, and regretted it.<br/><br/>Wolverine, as portrayed in this film, is one of the least compelling characters in the comic book universe. You find yourself not caring what happens to him by the end; this is troublesome for a movie that was trying to give you a back story to a very interesting character first introduced in the original X-Men movie.<br/><br/>Worst, he is overshadowed by some very interesting characters, most notably Gambit. They could have called this X-Men Origins: Gambit and left most of it intact, even though Gambit himself is on screen for a very short period.<br/><br/>I could keep going on; dialog is poor, camera-work is shoddy, the special effects are particularly bad for a high budget film, there are too many characters, and there really is no point to watching what happens to Wolverine.<br/><br/>Skip it. Catch it on FX, but only if there's nothing else on.<br/><br/>Michael"
"sonick_yooth","4","4","9","24 May 2009"," It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing
","Wolverine is a character that has only ever worked as a mystery wrapped in an enigma simply because once you start to probe too deep into comic book mythology, all you end up with are twists and turns that lead nowhere. To know all the nuances of every single character and where he fits in at a given time frame, you would have to have read every single piece of Wolverine/X-men fiction ever put on paper. I doubt that even Stan Lee could make much sense of it all. Marvel-type comics are designed as escapism fantasy for teen-age boys, full of action, off the wall characters and absurd story-lines. When Wolverine came on stage, he was supposed to have this staple aspect to him; unknown, haunting history that he would find out about piece by piece, but never quite assembling the whole puzzle. That was the point, ""troubled"" characters of Marvel-type comic book worlds are never supposed to be demystified because without that, they become proportionally uninteresting to how big the mystery around them was. <br/><br/>And then came this movie. This strange, unusual summer blockbuster to try and put the record straight. What we wound up with is a simple, paper thin story populated with uninteresting characters, full of noise that means nothing. Wolverine turned out to be a gentle soul, for some reason immortal (as far as I can tell, or is he supposed to be around 150 years old by the end of a film), and in no way interesting. He seems to be caught in the stream of life (read: retarded storyboard plot of this movie) without any power to do anything about it. He is just swept along, poor gentle bastard. He is a really nice guy, once you get to know him, no moral ambiguity in any of his actions (not quite the way I pictured Wolverine). <br/><br/>His brother started out as a bad guy from his first bad-guys look in his first scene, and pretty much stayed there the whole movie. Never does he have a single ounce of motivation for anything he does. I guess he is just bad to the bone and that's it.<br/><br/>Then there are all those secondary characters that could have been mildly interesting for a non-fan viewer if they where not all made of scenes and lines that are barely enough for cameos. I mean, Blob or Gambit or Deadpool (especially his final incarnation) all have pretty decent foundations and could have all made fine characters if writers decided to give them maybe just a few lines of actual dialog, instead of one liners and puns. Actually, that is mostly everything that any characters say throughout the movie. There is also a whole part with some surprisingly trusting old people that didn't made any sense, but you'll get used to things not making sense in this movie by then.<br/><br/>And then we have to mention the action. Much has been said on this subject, and, I must say, action sucks in this movie. That confrontation with the helicopter was obviously designed to be impressive, but turned out to be as bland as scenery they shot it on. And it could have been at least okay if just for a second you cared about what happens to anyone, which you don't. Action without any perceived peril for anyone important is pointless. There are also some laughable moments, like when he fights the Gambit and then chops of fire escape ladder piece by piece, but does it super fast. Won't even mention the ""moon legend"". Very, very bad piece of cinema lore. <br/><br/>Final confrontation is almost okay, but only because of the villain. Jumping and chasing on the edge of a nuclear reactor is imaginative, once again, in theory, but falls apart in the execution. I am not sure where all the millions were spent, but apart for some cool explosions and nice cgi backgrounds, it doesn't show up on screen.<br/><br/>After all that, it would seem that movie has no redeeming qualities, and that is only partially true. Despite very, very bad writing, uninterested direction (from the beginning it becomes just a string of loosely connected scenes with not much in between) and truly uninspired action scenes, film does have a decent cast. Actors are trying their best with what they are given to work with. <br/><br/>But, what sets this movie apart and is at least two stars of my final score, is it's unusual atmosphere. I am not quite sure where exactly it comes from, but surprisingly bleak visual style, whole Canadian lumber-mill part and chillingly effective final boss (oh god, if it only wasn't just a cardboard cut-out!) all amass to give a fine and surprising edge to a summer movie that doesn't quite deserve it. Oh, and another star is a result of the fact that movie goes harmlessly by. You wont be thrilled but neither will you be bored.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that Wolverine, stripped bare and revealed, isn't all that interesting. Studio greed is the main motivator behind this bland movie, and it is more than obvious on the big screen."

From my perspective this is the best X-men till now and may i say why: 1.The story the relations between Logan and his brother very very good it is something that you can relate.Danny Huston as Stryker was very good. The twists in the movie good too not clich√© as someone would say 2. The acting Everybody did a good job especially Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber even Kevin Durand had an interesting role that he filled the part very well. 3. The directing fast paced ,i almost fell asleep watching x-men 1-3, Everybody said the directing was wrong or something but listen to me i watched a lot of movies and i can tell you that the directing in this was good he knew how to keep the audience interested Remember this is an action movie not Godfather or The Fountain or a movie that you think of for 20 weeks to understand what they did. The Sfx could have been better not all of them but i would change the chopper chase scene and some other stuff .That is the Sfx company fault not the director. His vision might not have been for the fans but it is a very good movie non the less . Just the right ingredients for this movie to work (only if they could remake some of the Sfx )."

","The film starts in 1845 and by the time the credits is over, it is up to date. Wolverine and his brother are recruited to fight in a special mutant force. The mutants are never introduced. There is an assumption you know these characters from previous movies or comics. I would not recommend this film as an introduction to X-Men.<br/><br/>The special forces are more brutal than what Wolverine wants to be. ""This isn't what we signed up for, "" he says as he walks out. He becomes a Canadian and lives quietly like as a lumber jack. His brother is on a rampage...and Wolverine's life becomes disrupted. He must once again fight, only this time he is stronger and is more of a killer.<br/><br/>The movie ties in nicely with the other 4 X-Men movies, which should be viewed to get an overall picture, which is difficult to obtain in this film alone. The acting was sufficient. Good CG, super action and fighting. It has plot twists, so pay attention. The movie sprinkles in the right amount of humor, drama, and truisms into the dialogue to make it a fun watch."

"classicsoncall","7","3","6","14 May 2012"," ""You look like a man fixing to do a bad thing.""
","Wow, I didn't know I was supposed to hate this movie until I read all the fan reviews here. I know less about Marvel continuity than most, and obviously that's what has most of the haters ticked off. For me, this was pure and simple a super-hero action film, and if it bit off more than it could chew with the introduction of so many ancillary characters, well then maybe lesson learned for next time. Hugh Jackman certainly seems the best possible choice for the title character in terms of looks and attitude. Somehow I expected Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) to be meaner and hairier, no doubt from seeing him on his share of comic book covers. Which is what most of these Marvel flicks mean to me in the final analysis, the comic panels brought to life on the big screen and a couple hours worth of escapist entertainment. This doesn't put me in good stead with the reviewers who engaged in a doctoral dissertation on the subject, but I guess that's how it goes, let Gambit's cards fall where they may."
"The-Sarkologist","9","3","6","29 January 2012"," My favourite X-men Movie
","I will have to say that this is my favourite of the X-men movies. It seemed very slick and flowed quite well, and though there were a few continuity flaws (these mostly arising from First Class) all in all it was a heaps enjoyable movie, and in fact when to see it at the cinemas twice. The opening credits where we watch Wolverine and Sabretooth fight in pretty much every war up to Vietnam, and also the scene where he leaps off the jeep that had just been struck by a rocket, and then rip the rotors off of Agent Zero's chopper is probably the most memorable scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Being a movie based around the origins of Wolverine we can assume that it is going to be action packed, and it does not disappoint. The movie opens in the 1840s where Logan's (at this time he is called James) father is murdered by Victor's, and is then told that Victor is actually his brother. Victor Creed turns out that he has similar abilities to Logan, in that he has retractable claws and has a regeneration ability. In the comics there is no relation between Sabretooth and Wolverine, however it is very rare that movies will closely adhere to a comic book series (I am doubtful that Spiderman will ever appear in an X-men movie).<br/><br/>We also learn about how Wolverine gets his adamantium skeleton, and also learn how old he is. In the first X-men movie all we are told that it is impossible to determine his age as his regeneration ability also grants him longevity, though in the third movie, when Beast considers him a youngster, the grunt from Wolverine suggests that he does realise that he is actually quite old, though does not indicate how old he really is. Calculations made by fans of the movies put Wolverine's age to about 170 years plus.<br/><br/>This movie is about vengeance, but also about submitting to one's animal side. When we meet Sabretooth in the first movie (and there is no guarantee that Sabretooth is actually dead) he is much more animalistic and communicates mostly with grunts, however there is some acknowledgement of an animosity between him and Wolverine. It is also noticeable that Magneto does not entirely trust Sabretooth, due to his reversion to an animal nature. However Wolverine is completely the opposite. He does struggle with his animal nature, however he makes the choice that he will not slay innocents, at which point he walks away from the Weapon X team. His decision to settle down with a woman (who turns out to be a mutant named Silverfox) is an indication that he wants to be human as opposed to an animal.<br/><br/>We also meet Stryker in this film, as he is the main antagonist. He is obviously much younger than the Stryker we meet in X-2, however there are references to his son being a mutant and that it was because of his son's mutant powers that his wife was murdered. However in X-2 it is his desire to wipe out all mutants, where as here he is genetically experimenting with mutants to create the ultimate weapon. This weapons turns out to be Deadpool, who has a mix of abilities with a mouth that is sealed shut (the Deadpool character suffers from verbal diarrhoea).<br/><br/>I finally must mention that one of my favourite X-men, Gambit, makes an appearance in this film, though it is more than a bit part, it is not a huge role. It is a shame that Gambit never made an appearance in the later movies, but then the later movies are set 15 years after the events in this film, so whatever happened to Gambit in the films, it appears that he never joined the X-men."
"MBunge","6","3","6","18 June 2010"," Not a great story, but perhaps the greatest story that was never meant to be told
","The problem with making a film about the origin of the mutant super-hero Wolverine is that he was never meant to have an origin. He was created as a throwaway character for an issue of The Incredible Hulk, then got picked up as a supporting character for the revamping of the X-Men. No one really thought he was important enough to have his own origin, but he became one of the most popular comic book characters of the last 30 years. That led to a series of attempts to graft a powerful and moving beginning onto a character that was only intended to be a badass with a cool gimmick. But instead of a simple but profound start like ""Strange visitor from another planet"" or ""With great power comes great responsibility"", Wolverine got an origin that became increasingly convoluted and overwrought as more and more was added to it over time. That's reflected in this movie, which actually crams at least three distinct origin tales into 107 minutes. Throw in the traditional ""summer movie"" buttload of explosions, gunfire and combat and there's not much room left for a good story.<br/><br/>I mean, you know that scene where someone kneels over the body of a dead loved one and screams ""Nooooooooo!"" to the heavens? This movie has two scenes like that. It has a shot of Wolverine walking into the camera as a huge explosion goes off behind him. There's a character who is clearly established as being a mass murderer, but then the film suddenly decides that being a mass murderer isn't that big a deal. Not to mention that this is the first time I've ever seen a movie literally stop and explain its own ending 15 minutes before it actually happens.<br/><br/>Taking all in all, though, this isn't a bad film. The action sequences are all pretty good, the acting is better than you usually get for this sort of thing and while the story is kind of a mess, it makes enough sense that you're not left sitting in the theater thinking that every character in the movie is an idiot.<br/><br/>In fact, this is the rare action movie where the acting is probably the best thing about it. Ryan Renolds and Kevin Durand are legitimately funny as mutants Deadpool and The Blob. Hugh Jackman is okay, though you can tell he works a lot better with someone to play off of than he does on his own. Danny Huston as William Stryker and Liev Schreiber and Sabretooth give probably the best performances of the film. It's not always easy to play a younger version of a character already portrayed by a fine actor, but Huston makes Stryker just similar enough to the man from X-Men 2 and is able to give him a little more depth. Schreiber brings real emotion and a sense of legitimacy his furry mutant. His Sabretooth isn't just a prop for Wolverine's story, but a living, breathing character in his own right.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells a story that was never meant to be told. It doesn't do it very well, but that it can do it at all without being a total disaster is something of an achievement. This movie doesn't have a personal element that ever rises above the clich√© and it has none of the broader moral or societal points that were found in the X-trilogy itself. This is just a big, dumb, fun ""summer movie"" and I suppose there's nothing wrong with that."

","Marvel and Twentieth Century Fox hit the ground running with the first installment of their new ""X-men Origins"" series of movies. As a fan of Wolverine since he first joined the X-men in 1975, I've already gone through several revisions of Logan's history and found those on the movie to be acceptable. Younger 'purists', however, may have a problem with changes to his back story. Hugh Jackman once again did a magnificent job as Wolverine, Liev Schreiber did a wonderful job of fleshing out Sabertooth and showing him as the sociopath Marvel created instead of the brainless animal from the first X-men movie, and Taylor Kitsch was fantastic as Remy ""Gambit"" LeBeau (though I would have liked to have heard more of a Cajun dialect from him!). Over all, I give it 6 Claws Up! A Definite Must See!"
"bob the moo","Null","3","6","19 January 2010"," The noise and effects may distract but otherwise it is a fairly empty blockbuster that doesn't really engage on any level
","If you remember a week or so before this film was released anywhere, the news outlets were reporting that a work print of the film was being downloaded by tens of thousands of internet users around the world. This copy was only partially finished and was missing a lot of music and finalised special effects, with safety lines etc still being clearly visible. The usual talking heads bemoaned internet piracy, Hugh Jackman said he was disappointed that people would watch a film that was not yet what the makers wanted it to be and the FBI were supposedly involved in the investigation of this leaked copy. Having finally seen Wolverine for myself I have to look back on all this fuss and wonder why so many people bothered downloading an unfinished version of this film (other than to make a point that they could do so) because given how average the completed film is, I cannot think of much worth seeing if the effects are unfinished.<br/><br/>Wolverine is a summer blockbuster and a film that you could fairly expect to be heavily reliant on action and special effects and you would be right, because there is not a lot else here for the viewer. The plot has its moments but generally there is no atmosphere to it. The brother relationship leads only to two hairy men running at one another ‚Äì there isn't any real tension or drama between the characters beyond the superficial level needed to trigger the action sequences. Surprisingly, considering how loved Wolverine is by fans and casual viewers alike, there is very little in the way of excitement about seeing this character develop and become the weapon that he is when most of us met him for the first time. What we do get though is a straightforward narrative which produces lots of action sequences and parades a lot of comic-book characters in and out for those that care about such things (which, although I recognise many of them with ease, I don't care if they are just there for the sake of saying they are there). As such it does enough to be passable and set up the action sequences which are, after all, the only reason the majority of us are here.<br/><br/>Shame then that these too feel very average in the whole. Technically I'm sure it is all impressive but none of it really has much in the way of excitement or immediacy, leaving me watching things explode etc without ever being emotionally involved. It is definitely a film from the Mummy Returns school of action film-making in this regard and like this franchise, one never forgets that the visual effects are just that ‚Äì computer creations that aren't real and pose no threat. It is not that they are ""bad"" effects but just that the use of visual effects is across the entire film to the point where green screen sections are so apparently green screen creations that it does hurt the film and act as another barrier in how one gets into the action. Like I say, given this is the deal with the final film I wondered why anyone would have stuck with the film in an unfinished state.<br/><br/>The cast and characters are varied. Jackman does his usual stuff as Wolverine; grizzled expression, tough stare, toned and muscular stance. The film gives him a few moments of emotion beyond the basic rage used in action sequences but he cannot do anything of real interest. Schreiber has a better time of it because he does have an evil glint to his performance that makes him more interesting and dangerous. Huston plays Striker reasonably well and offers up a solid bad guy. The addition of the other characters/cast is where the problem comes from. I am not a real comic fan but I can understand why those that are would object to the treatment of some of their characters here. Not only are some of the characters wheeled in for almost no reason (Gambit, Cyclops) but some characters are changed for the worse (Deadpool) and others are simply played by bad actors (Will.i.am is not a name I want to see on the credits of another film any time soon).<br/><br/>Overall Wolverine stands as the film that it appears to be a first glance ‚Äì a blockbuster with plenty of spectacle but not a lot else, which of course feeds back into the action as it detaches the viewer, thus making it feel even more like empty spectacle. It isn't as bad as some say but there isn't a great deal to recommend it for once you take it out of its home turf of ""heavily promoted summer global release"", where the scale, newness and noise may have done enough to impress."
"Hitchcoc","6","3","6","14 August 2009"," Too Many Sour Notes
","My son got me involved in these movies and, having not grown up reading the X-men, I am frequently forced to ask questions of him to clarify the events. That being said, I have enjoyed the movies mostly and have picked up on some of the ethos. This one is interesting in that it explains some things, disappointing in that there are so many unexplained phenomena in it. I do like Hugh Jackman, the angst ridden protagonist, but the story is so over the top that it leaves me with more questions than when I entered the theater. I also have trouble with the powers that characters have and which are more powerful than others and what their weaknesses are. Are they indeed incapable of being destroyed one time and vulnerable the next. Yes, I know the comic books explain these things but with all their sophisticated abilities, they still spend most of their time pounding on each other. Do they know that for some a thump on the head just doesn't do the job. Oh, well. None of it is that serious and there is a lot of action, even if it doesn't always make sense."

OK, maybe the part where Wolverine watches his own adamantium nails you could note that is rendered.<br/><br/>It has funny parts and love parts.<br/><br/>I didn't like some typical clich√© dialogs and scenes, but you can't expect this to be improved in a Hollywood super production. Also the way they decide to erase Wolverine's memory was cheap.

","After watching X-men 3 The Last Stand, (a film that i felt was definitely the weakest of the X Trilogy) I went to see X-Men Origins Wolverine with very low expectations. I thought it would be a film filled with action, bad dialogue and slow fragmented story, rather like The Watchmen. <br/><br/>How very wrong i was, I found the film to be totally engaging all the way through, it was satisfying to watch and unpredictable which is quite rare these days, especially with this type of movie. The story is well executed and ties in nicely with X-2. Overall i left the theatre pleasantly surprised. On balance this film is a good all rounder. The heroism of Wolverine is well defined and also so is his motivation to avenge certain deeds done upon him. <br/><br/>The film's weakness however lie in some clich√©d moments which could of been executed better i think. Also a rather creepy digitally enhanced cameo from a well known English actor towards the end, was not convincing and again could of been executed better. These however and very forgivable. <br/><br/>Lastly, I don't think this film has had a fair press. It does have a different feel to the other X-men films, and perhaps that is why fans of the series found this to be a disappointment. But make no mistake, this is a good film well worth seeing."
"Crannicus_Maximus","8","3","6","5 May 2009"," Finally! A Superhero Flick That Gets It!
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a non-stop romp featuring improbable scenarios, ripping biceps, and a massive amount of CGI. It is action packed, exciting, and more than a little over-the-top. In essence, it is precisely what every superhero movie should aspire to be.<br/><br/>Alright, so the movie isn't likely to win any Oscars. To be honest, it probably won't even curry a single nomination, unless the venerable Academy decides to throw it a bone with a nod for the spectacular CGI (cheesy rendering of Patrick Stewart notwithstanding).<br/><br/>But unlike half of the so-called dramas that are released every year, this movie isn't chuck full of pretense. It doesn't even try to push some tremendous social statement into its length. It just aims to entertain. And whether you're in the cinema looking for a touch of drama, or some explosive action, or just the latest muscle-laden action/adventure outing, you'll probably leave the theatre with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Why? Because there's something supremely entertaining about watching a bunch of ridiculously pumped-up (or, in the case of the superb Kevin Durand, ridiculously 'chunked-up') guys smack each other around.<br/><br/>The film takes liberties with a few story lines, but by this point in time any fan boy with a brain stem should understand that the latest comic book-to-cinema screen outing isn't going to follow the series directly (it'd be far too difficult to bring new blood into the fold that way, don't you think?). And Taylor Kitsch may not have been the best pick for the Gambit role. And they probably could've left some of those excess mutants (Emma Frost, for instance) out of the picture. And the storyline was a tad predictable. And there were a few tragically clich√©/corny moments. But overall, the film was solid, and well worth the money I dropped on it.<br/><br/>Seriously, take off the critic's lenses and kick back. You might find yourself enjoying it."
"KillerK1991","8","3","6","5 May 2009"," NOT the Worst Movie Ever. Quite the Opposite Actually....
","There are two movies I have been anticipating for 2009- Terminator: Salvation, and this film, Wolverine: Origins. Now first of all, the consensus of the critical(or perhaps, non-critical) masses appears to be that this film completely sucked. That could not be farther from the truth- <br/><br/>The Good: - This film hooked me from beginning to end, after which I could not wait to see it again, which I did only 3 days afterward. The intensity of this film is intoxicating, and it happens to keep everything interesting at all times. - The acting is awesome. I can't think of a single bad performance, as everyone holds their own. I can't imagine anyone but Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and wish Liev Schreiber tried out for Sabetooth a bit sooner...say freakin' 2000! Taylor Kitsch should've worked on his Cajun accent a bit more, however this is a problem these X films have had since day one. Just look at Collossus. - I enjoyed the effects. The action scenes are all superb and give you the urge to run outside and punch people. People complain that they where too computer heavy(perhaps), but they didn't bother me, as they still looked very good. <br/><br/>The Bad: - It could've used more Deadpool/Weapon X shenanigans. I had a feeling at times that this film tried to be in way too many places at once. It should've/could've been a lot simpler and would've still worked. - Wolverine's loss of memory via revolver was a bad choice. It should've happened at the operating table in a clearer version of his nightmarish flashbacks. - They should've refrained from using Deadpool as Weapon X1. If anything, it should've been Wolverine and Deadpool vs Weapon X1 and Sabertooth at the end. At least they seemed to have fixed this mistake in the scene after the credits. - They needed to explain the transformation from Sabertooth to Feral Sabertooth. They should've had Wolverine stab Sabertooth in the freakin' brain at the end. - The Silverfox Twist was a little too much. I guess it was necessary due to the direction this film took, but still, they could've gotten around it. It was a little too hokey. Her stayin' dead would've given his quest much more meaning.<br/><br/>Overall: A vastly entertaining, well-done film marred by a few continuity errors and perplexing differentiations from the comic that would've made the story much better. In trying so hard to connect it to the X Men films, they ended up making things a little worse. Despite that, it still did FAR FAR FAR FAR, less damage to the franchise as a whole in terms of what it did with it's characters then X3. Bring on the sequel!"

","The negative feedback I have been picking up about this movie worried me. I was starting to be convinced that I wouldn't enjoy it at all.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was not without flaws, but I thought it was great fun.<br/><br/>Of necessity episodic, it provided a decent origin story, some new mutants, retooled villains in Victor Creed and Stryker, and plenty of opportunity for Jackman to show both the feral and the touchy-feely sides of Logan.<br/><br/>It was also pretty solidly action-packed, and most of the action moved the plot along (with the possible exception of some of the Logan/Creed fighting).<br/><br/>I was delighted to see Patrick Stewart's cameo at the end.<br/><br/>Jackman, as usual, gave a committed Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber delivered a highly entertaining Creed. Danny Huston isn't my favourite actor, and I preferred Brian Cox's Stryker.<br/><br/>Yes, there was some howling - Logan as a boy howled on the first appearance of the claws, there was an adult howling not long afterwards, then there was the howling at the death of Kayla and, finally, the howling following the adamantium bonding. Possibly a howl too far, but I was minded to excuse it.<br/><br/>I got somewhat confused at family relationships at the start (I'm still no wiser) but it didn't spoil things.<br/><br/>And, while I know I am easily pleased at the movies, my 25 year old son and 82 year old mother both left the cinema having thoroughly enjoyed it."

","HBCU247.com wries I'm a fan of X-Men, and have always like watching Hugh Jackman in a movie. The story, X-Men: Wolverine, covers Wolverine (Logan)'s childhood through adulthood where you meet his brother, Sabretooth (Live Schreiber), the love of his life Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins), and other mutant friends. The movie was thoroughly entertaining with action, romance, violence, and duplicity, but one thing did puzzle me¬Öthe Sabretooth storyline, in the first X-Men it seemed like Wolverine and Sabretooth were moral enemies, while in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, they seemed to experience sibling rivalry that was all patched up¬Ö(now I'm afraid it has confused me more) If you can let me know what the real story is between the two of them at Brown_247@comcast.net, I would greatly appreciate it. Although it was nice having a background story to Wolverine, there was something in the mysteriousness of Wolverine that appealed to me, I just hope we won't become overwhelmed with background stories for the rest of the X-Men team! Another thing while watching the movie, in the first X-Men, it was mentioned that Wolverine came from a violent past, meanwhile the movie shows that his past was not so violent after all¬Öso Wolverine experiencing amnesia seemed quite pointless. In fact, even though there was action, there didn't seem to be much drama¬Ödoes drama make for a good action movie? There were some comedic moments (at least they were funny to me) such as when Sabretooth says ""Ooh, Shiny"" when Wolverine whips out his new claws. So go get some laughs, be entertained, and just ENJOY!"

Other then that the scenes are stupid and it does not make any sense. Plus, it just makes up a lot of stuff that does not even make sense. They Hollywood it, and hard, by taking something and making it its own story. It doesn't even have anything to do with the other X-Men movies. If it did then Sabertooth would simply tell Wolverine why he does not remember anything rather then there just being a random hatred. And the bone claws?!? Where did that come from? Wolverine was made the mutant he is, not conceived it with everything but the adamantium bones. If you have half a brain for good movies then you won't like this movie. If you just like action with awful writing and overacting or underacting (no median), then you may just like this movie."
"zardoz-13","10","8","24","3 May 2009"," Fantastic Fluff!!!
","Seldom does Hollywood produce a comic book prequel as potent and perfect as ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" a no-holds-barred barrage of CGI effects, and brawny derring-do that will overwhelm you with its sheer extravagance in less than 120 minutes‚Äîactually a trim 107 minutes. ""Tsotsi"" director Gavin Hood and savvy scenarists David Benioff of ""Troy"" and Skip Woods of ""Swordfish"" shove enough testosterone into this larger-than-life spectacle to fuel an entire franchise. After the anemic as well as dismal closure that Brett Ratner's ""X-Men: Last Stand"" provided the ""X-Men"" trilogy, ""X-Men: Wolverine"" brings you back to life like a shot of adrenalin to the heart.<br/><br/>Reprising the role that make him a household name, a mutton-chopped Hugh Jackman wields the razor-sharp knuckle knives that he deploys like a Cuisinart in the original ""X-Men"" to slash and gash anybody and anything that gets in his way. Like any really good prequel, ""Wolverine"" brings the action full-circle so that we learn how Professor Charles Xavier wound up with many of the wards that he supervises in director Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" (2000). Mind you, ""Wolverine"" lacks the subtlety that distinguished the first two ""X-Men"" movies, but this prequel makes up for it with high-octane, slam-bang, edge-of-your-seat action sequences that make your blood pump.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a melodrama about two mutants that traces their origins back to Canada's Northwest Territory in the year 1845. As the two half brothers, James Logan (Hugh Jackman of ""Australia"") and his older, more unstable semi-sibling Victor Creed (Live Schreiber of ""Scream"") flee from their family in Canada and seek refuge in America after Logan kills the man that he believes is his father. Hood and his scribes spend more time probing the back story of the highly conflicted Logan from his turbulent childhood to his tragic romance with a school teacher.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, every step of Logan's life entwines with that of his unruly brother who suffers from anger management issues. Yes, eventually, Victor will become known as 'Sabretooth,' but for now he is just Victor. The credit sequence depicts our pugnacious pair--Logan and Victor--displaying their extraordinary strength, nimble dexterity and protean ability to regenerate no matter how devastating their wounds as they wade through the American Civil War, World Wars I and II, and Vietnam. Logan exerts more control over his bestial nature, while Victor wallows in his blood lust for death and violence.<br/><br/>In Vietnam, Victor plunges off the deep end. He murders innocent Vietnamese civilians as well as American G.I.s. The Army slaps both Logan and him in front of a firing squad. Of course, these indestructible killing machines cannot die from ordinary bullets. They survive the firing squad's fusillade but find themselves chained up again until General William Stryker (a nefarious Danny Huston of ""The Aviator"" at his oiliest) persuades them to be ""part of a special team with special privileges."" (Incidentally, Brian Cox played an older Stryker in ""X-Men 2."") This black-bag, covert operations unit called Team X consists of fellow mutants, including Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds of ""Blade: Trinity""), Agent Zero (Eurasian newcomer Daniel Henney), Wraith (novice Will.i.Am), Fred J. Dukes/The Blob (Kevin Durand of ""Smokin' Aces"") and Bradley (Dominic Monaghan of TV's ""Lost"") and resembles a mutant ""Magnificent Seven."" For the record, Wade Wilson is a wizard with a sword. Agent Zero handles pistols like a gunman from a John Woo shoot-up with Chow Yun-Fat. For example, after he empties both magazines in his automatic pistols, he drops the clips, sends his sidearms somersaulting into the air like Wild Bill Hickok, snatches two fresh clips from his belt, and jams them into the grips as the guns fall spinning into his fists. Wraith specializes in teleporting. He's somewhere one second and another place a second later. Bradley handles electricity like a conjurer.<br/><br/>During a bloodbath of a massacre in Nigeria, Logan quits Team X and masquerades back home in Canada as a ordinary, everyday lumberjack who has settled down with a luscious schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) with has a knack for getting people to do what she wants, including muscle-bound Logan. Meanwhile, Logan wants nothing to do with his angry half-brother, but the bond between Logan and Victor proves to be stronger than even they imagined. Moreover, Victor isn't content to let Logan skip out on him and he sets out to track him down with predictable results that forces Logan to confront his bestial nature on grounds that he cannot control. The treacherous Stryker lures Logan back to his laboratory and convinces him to participate in his highly hush-hush program Weapon X and Logan is reborn as Wolverine with an impenetrable alloy known as adamantium that makes him indestructible. Raving like the usual mad scientist, Stryker informs everybody about how he is going to create an army of these killers, but he forgets that Logan can hear him. Logan succumbs to his beastly nature, transforms into Wolverine, bursts out of the tank, and takes off.<br/><br/>Director Gavin Hood attracted praise for his first effort ""Tsotsi,"" a formidable drama set in South Africa about a teenage hoodlum who discovered an infant and shields it from the elements. Hood's second movie ""Rendition"" with Reese Witherspoon and Jake Gyllenhaal withered, but ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" finds Hood back at the top of his game. Hood stages several incredible as well as outrageous combat sequences between not only Wolverine and Victor but also Wolverine and his other antagonists. The violence is the stuff of far-out fantasy with no relation to anything realistic. Hood manages to juggle multiple characters with ease so that we're never confused about who is trying to smackdown whom. Marvel Comic's purists may quibble about the liberties that Hood and his writers take with the source material, but ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" qualifies as a first-rate, old-fashioned smackdown that will keep you rooting for the hero through thick and thin."

"Romarth","Null","5","13","15 May 2009"," Things haven't improved...
","Hugh Jackman's Logan (better known as ""Wolverine"") was easily one of the most endearing characters of the original X-Men trilogy, what with his gruff and occasionally witty candor, impetuous hot-headed disposition, yet ultimately caring tendencies. He had all the bad-ass of any iconic anti-hero, and we loved him. Plus, sterling casting sought to it that the perfect actor, Jackman, would embody him to his fullest potential, and since the trilogy was pretty much The Wolverine Show, all these aspects equaled a great success.<br/><br/>Basically, this spin off had a lot to live up to. Not only did it have to continue to capture the vivid appeal of the beloved character, it also had to redeem the franchise after the embarrassing hiccup of Brett Ratner's X-Men: The Last Stand, the last installment in the otherwise impressive trilogy. Was it successful in doing so? Sadly, unfortunately, tragically, X-Men Origins: Wolverine doesn't achieve either.<br/><br/>I'll admit that Gavin Hood's prequel is better than X-Men 3, but it's still a messy and gormless piece of eye candy-filter (much like The Last Stand was), that damn-near tarnishes the integrity of the Wolverine character.<br/><br/>Now, that's a lot of criticism for one sentence. But, in all honesty, Wolverine doesn't really deserve an in-depth analysis; it's straightforward action mediocrity. It's, very simply, a victim of the common ailment of unimaginative direction.<br/><br/>The main source of the problem is Wolverine's drastic mistreatment; the character is neutered, all of his integrity diluted, now only a milquetoast shadow of his old self; not once does he showcase the ass-kicking brilliance that is paramount to his iconic stature. It's a bit of a boyish peeve, but even the moody, gloomy Watchmen indulge their rough-housing sides in Zack Snyder's adaptation (which, for the record, though only genre-related, is a lot better, I might add). Even his surly parlance is softened, ne'er a memorable candid remark in sight.<br/><br/>You'd assume such an immense fault in the movie would be its greatest flaw. But, oh no, Wolverine is far too risible for that. The movie's biggest crime is that the film is bereft of any distinguishable plot. The narrative is scatter-shot beyond coherence, with little or no continuity, the story following a very apparent and laughable format: Wolverine meets a character, fights briefly, than, following dialog usually a long the lines of ""okay, listen, pal, you're gonna *insert task here*, or I'm gonna *insert threatening remark here*"", he sets off with a new purpose, and repeats the same.<br/><br/>What's tragic is that the first fifteen to twenty minutes or so are very captivating, from the assaulting opening credits to the action-packed mission sequence. It's a movie that inevitably promises greatness, but has bitten off far more than it can chew.<br/><br/>Worse still, the inclusion of characters like Deadpool and Gambit is completely pointless, their screen time unmemorable and disappointingly fleeting, their crow-barred appearances nothing more than a ridiculous advertising scheme, it would seem. Which is a serious shame, because Ryan Reynolds mini-performance is pitch-perfect. Of course, I can't really say the same for Taylor Kitsch, who (and truer words have never been spoken) is undoubtedly not Cajun.<br/><br/>The acting on the villain's part is a lot more impressive: The movie's only concrete redeemable feature is Liev Schreiber's Sabretooth, who makes a diverting, albeit clich√©, villain, his brooding presence a welcome contrast to Jackman's kitty Wolverine. Danny Huston, here playing the part of William Stryker, a role originally taken by national treasure Brian Cox (whom Huston looks nothing like!), is also on form, despite a script that serves him the cheesiest of dialog and most OTT of Machiavellian agendas.<br/><br/>But things don't stay positive for long; even the editing is hopeless. Each fight scene is probably jaw-dropping, but it's impossible to notice due to the horribly erratic editing. Should it not be bad enough that the CGI is painful (two words: ""claws"" and ""bathroom"")? To be honest, it's a wonderful depiction of self-parody. I mean, each moment is dripping with cheese, and each character seems to be recycled from other superhero movies (the old couple didn't give Wolverine their son's stuff; it was their nephew's, because he's probably freaking' Spider-Man!).<br/><br/>Okay, so I probably haven't been of very sound mind writing this review. The movie isn't the worst thing that's happened ever, but it's still pretty bad. It's baffling, really; how did it turn out so bad? Gavin Hood directed it, and he's got a reasonably adequate filmography. It had a simple story. It had a very simple demographic to pander to (action-loving jocks and fan-boys). So how? Who knows? All I know is that only a decent Deadpool spin off will revive this fan-boy's belief in a now near-dead franchise.<br/><br/>In conclusion: not unbearable, but definitely forgettable. 'Nuff said."

","This summer's supposed ""first big movie event of the year"" fell flat... right on top of Wolverine's claws.<br/><br/>This is the fourth X-Men movie (although the first of the ""Origins"" movies), centering specifically on our favourite snide mutant, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Focusing on numerous amounts of different tie-in stories, this tries to fill in the origination of Wolverine--how he came to be, why he makes a ""PING"" sound when hit, and his rather strange love-hate relationship with his ""rival"", Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber).<br/><br/>""X-Men Origins"" tries to play itself off as a solid, full-proof throw to all the fans with cameos and effects, whilst still holding itself high on a 'great' plot to please all movie-goers... unfortunately, it doesn't stand long.<br/><br/>The special effects were visually stunning, but when a movie tries to be successful by ONLY that, there's a very, very big problem. The effects are nice--explosions, big fight scenes, mutant powers galore, destruction--but the plot can't seem to make up its own mind. Leaving plenty of plot holes and jumping all around to just move along, movie-goers are left with nothing but Wolverine continuously yelling and raging to be entertained by. And I can't go on without saying that the ending was really anti-climatic and seemed rushed.<br/><br/>I, myself, personally hate when movies try to stuff a movie full with CGI, because it's ""new"" and it's ""cooler"". But this movie isn't shy at all to give us plenty, to which it grows old and boring.<br/><br/>But as for pluses, the movie has its funny moments. Its fight scenes are wildly exciting (for the most part). Hugh and Liev have a very unique and appealing chemistry together on screen as opposing brethren. And the cameos of popular and loved characters, like Gambit and such were a nice throw to the fans and viewers (albeit the cameos were too short, even for ""main"" characters...).<br/><br/>""X-Men Origins"" is a decent popcorn movie. It's worth at least 1 view at the theatres, if not just for a date or to go out with friends. But aside from that, it's not a movie worth owning or even recommending in all seriousness.

","I am not one to bash for the sake of bashing ... I love the genre and am generally forgiving (I didn't hate ""Ride of The Silver Surfer"" though it deserved to be hated). 'Bad acting' has never gotten in my way of enjoying a good romp (as in many of Arnold's films) with action and effects. ***HOWEVER*** ""Wolverine"" was so bad, I walked out & cannot remember the last time I did that! Hugh & Liev are good ... the dialogue is good - that is what is maddening! How do you mess up ""Wolverine""? The sets, the effects & make-up were laughable, especially the claws and nails. I know it's ""only a comic book"" - but comic books still rely on ""physics."" One needs a 'baseline & a basis' to suspend disbelief in sci-fi etc. There was no basis for anything. the action wasn't gratuitous, it was bad & badly choreographed. It would seem that Gavin Hood never watched the other X-Men films or The Bourne films or any movies ever for that matter. In consideration of Marvel's triumph with 2008's ""Iron Man"" ... fine effort with 2008's ""Hulk,"" I view ""Wolverine"" as a major set back. ""Watchmen"" was ""Gone With The Effin' Wind"" compared to this disaster."

","Went to see this movie on alone, as I couldn't get anyone to join me. Apparently they were much smarter than I, since the movie was very poor.<br/><br/>Well, it had some action sequences, but they were not that nicely done and Wolverine never unleashed his true fury. On top of that he was glorified like a true American hero. As far as I know, the most interesting thing about Logan is his shady personality and unethical actions. This is how he was in his early years (at least the first 100 years he lived). Unfortunately Hollywood managed to make this dull and lemon like enough for me to squeeze its juices into a long drink instead, but it HAD no juice.<br/><br/>One might have hoped that if not Wolverine, then Sabretooth would have been ruthless. But even that he started off in the movie as a true villain showing no remorse or feelings when killing innocent people, he too ended up being vandalized by Hollywoods need to make everyone into a glorified hero.<br/><br/>Why not picture them as they're portrayed in the comics???? Stay at least a little true to their origin... Why else would you call it X-Men Origins, if you just make your own stuff up along the way.<br/><br/>Thin story, mediocre acting (except from Liev Schreiber), irrelevant directing. Another typical movie based on an already popular character to cash in some easy money from the success of previous movies sees the dawn of day.<br/><br/>Back to Basics and take a look at Iron Man or Batman to see how you make a movie portraying characters from comics.<br/><br/>I wouldn't even pay 5¬ß for it on DVD, which it ought to cost within the first month after release.<br/><br/>Play the game on Xbox 360, at least his claws get bloody after slicing human meat there.

Director Gavin Hood, after his assured mainstream debut with ""rendition"" will surely have the studios after him as he delivers the goods in blockbuster format.<br/><br/>The opportunities raised by ""going back to the beginning"" are largely eschewed in favour of big set piece action scenes, with some of the scene setting sequences bewildering. Lyn Collins, as Silverfox is cruelly under used in a curiously emotionless picture.

","To the person who said the CG sucks, you were watching the unfinished film.<br/><br/>Still, as much as I love the Wolverine character, the usual nemeses, brother betrayal, etc, is getting long in the tooth. The story is weak. Why spend so much money on building an indestructible man, and then 'chop his head off'? And even the second after it's finished? Melodramatic delirium for nothing.<br/><br/>Why should the brother kill W's girlfriend? Why not be a man and cut to the chase, and why not show that such an act is cowardice? If the brother wants to be strong, then doing banal rubbish like that is stupid. Why doesn't it hurt W every time his blades are released anymore. Now he does it for an amusement trick instead of the unbearable pain he went through before.<br/><br/>Reviewers say it is more human, but really, it looks more plastic to me. Just going through the motions of fear and friendship. Only Liev kind of got it. He's a big dude that acts like he doesn't need support, but he has the military behind him to act like a big shot with a purpose. Very boring.<br/><br/>I don't see the strength in these characters. You want animal? You stab that Asian shooter and look at his eyes die, giving in to the weakness of rage, not recreate an explosion like the end of Mad Max and think you are cool.<br/><br/>Considering the cliffhangers they want to throw at the audience, it would have been better to let the cat out of the bag early and really push the depth of the characters for wanting to do that. and save any cliffhanger (if they need it) at the end. In essence, all these mutants are people, too. All have different beliefs, all are pretty lonely. That's human. Work it amongst military idiots, made all the more idiotic by saying one thing and the next in five minutes. Work that. Even the beginning is wrong, showing these guys toughness by glorifying war. War guys are tough, but what a waste of energy.<br/><br/>The torture between W's integrity and pain makes us identify with the character. Now he has become just one guy tossed around with others in a salad. Which part should I eat next?"

The pacing is far too slow to be exciting and thrilling. The build up is too long, making the first half of the film ""all talk no action"".<br/><br/>I think ""X Men"" was successful was because the films have a lot of characters with different supernatural powers. The fights between various mutants are breathtaking. In ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", there are only a handful of mutants, and they do not have much chances of showing off their powers.

"MovieAddict2016","4","5","14","1 May 2009"," Lame.
","It's hard to dislike Hugh Jackman, which is why it's frustrating to witness him suffering through a number of films. He's a talented actor who's been stuck in a rut lately, and if anyone was hoping that Wolverine would be a return to form, those expectations may well be diminished within the first few minutes alone: this is just a shockingly messy film.<br/><br/>When the much-publicized workprint edition (notably lacking many special effects) leaked last month, FOX Pictures was quick to offer that it was an ""inaccurate representation of the movie,"" and that over 15 additional minutes of footage were missing from the cut. And yet, based on comments I've read from other journalists and fans who saw both versions, it seems the final product is almost identical to the pirated version ‚Äî sloppy, awkwardly paced and wholly inconsistent in tone, style and purpose. One minute it's a dark, brooding attempt at Batman Begins-level reinvention; the next moment it's a campy, over-the-top action spectacle. The film never finds a balance, and it doesn't help that neither of its extremes are particularly effective in their own right: the ""dark"" moments feel vapid and the lighter moments just seem misplaced, like they're scenes being set up solely to be easily mocked by one of those Epic Movie spoofs. Wolvie loses his girlfriend and vows to avenge her death, and five minutes later he's having a comical boxing match with a fat superhero (Kevin Durand), whose obesity is the subject of jokes from both Wolverine and Wraith (will.i.am). I don't know about you, but if the love of my life was just brutally murdered by my own brother, the last thing I'd do is find room for cracking weight jokes. The movie tries to give Wolverine his humanity, but how can we sympathize with this character when it's hard for us to understand what, exactly, he's motivated by? His revenge seems more convenient than genuine, especially nearing the end, when a Shocking Revelation generates a hugely underwhelming emotional response.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Gavin Hood, whose filmography begs the question: why the hell did Fox hire this guy? He has a single well-received film to his credit ‚Äî Tsotsi ‚Äî which was also a low-budget, independent foreign feature. He may well be a very talented independent director (that has yet to be determined), but he is clearly out of his element here, much in the same way that dramatic filmmaker Marc Forster didn't know how to handle the action choreography for Quantum of Solace last year. In both cases, the studios seemed to assume that an established indie director would be able to handle a multi-billion-dollar action franchise, and in both cases, the studios were wrong. This is further evidence of the fact that multi-genre directors are under-appreciated ‚Äî just because you're good at low-key character studies doesn't prove you know how to stage huge superhero fight sequences.<br/><br/>Rumour has it that Richard Donner stepped in to perform re-shoots early this year, which is ironic given the movie's nod - of all things - towards Superman: Wolverine, on the run from General Stryker (Danny Huston), shows up at the home of an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere. The movie attempts to develop characterization and depth within the time frame of five minutes, which makes the ultra-dramatic outcome of the elderly couple unintentionally funny: it elicited uncomfortable ""should-I-be-laughing-at-this?"" reactions in the audience. The proceeding chase sequence ‚Äî which has been put forth as the film's biggest action highlight ‚Äî is actually rather unimpressive and, at worst, goofy. The special effects are not particularly awe-inspiring, either. Oh, and they manage to add another nod towards an old film: Steve McQueen in The Great Escape. I mean, really? <br/><br/>I haven't even had time to address the movie's numerous plot holes. The biggest one I can't even specify, because the crux of the film rests on its revelation; suffice to say, it's the perfect example of a film being built around a singular idea than around a fully-developed story. And the movie's wide array of nerd-pandering character cameos just feels forced and distracting; Ryan Reynolds, as Wade Wilson, is on-screen just about long enough for us to start warming up to him, before he proceeds to rapidly disappear from (most of) the rest of the film. Huh? And what about Dominic Monaghan as Bolt? Talk about a thankless role. I may be proved wrong, but it's my impression that fans will be upset that their favourite characters are only getting five minutes of screen time, while, to someone like myself, who's unfamiliar with the comic books, these appearances lack reason altogether. Trimming the fat would have made a leaner, more efficient and realized vehicle.<br/><br/>There are a few redeeming qualities ‚Äî Liev Schreiber works well when the movie is in campy mode, chewing the scenery as Sabretooth. But even this positive is variable, because when he pops up in the darker sequences, his over-the-top relishing is incongruent. It's like if Robert Downey Jr.'s acerbic, eccentric characterization of Tony Stark had showed up during one of the darkest moments of The Dark Knight: it just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>And that phony darkness is ultimately Wolverine's most prominent flaw: in the era of the brooding superheroes, this film seems like a relic of a bygone era, devoid of any actual intensity, commitment, realism or ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî the honesty of, say, Knight or even Iron Man. And the real crime is that it wouldn't feel so hokey, so dated and so desperately misplaced if the filmmakers hadn't tried to make it something it wasn't; by introducing artificial brood, the film draws instant comparison with its superiors, relegating it to a category shared only by the 2003 Hulk as a superhero movie that at once doesn't know whether to wink knowingly at the audience or Say Something Really Important."
"Robert_duder","9","3","7","23 August 2009"," The absolutely perfect spin off with the perfect character to do it with!!
","The Xmen films literally set a standard for Marvel superhero films and launched an epic array of the Marvel Universe characters some better than others but none, in my humble opinion, as good as, or as thoroughly created, or more brilliantly casted than X-Men. The top of that pile was Hugh Jackman who anyone would be convinced the character of Logan ""Wolverine"" was based off of and not the other way around. Jackman IS Wolverine and created one of the best heroes of recent years. It only made sense to give the X-Men character with the most complex, mysterious story line a terrific spin off to answer all or most of our questions and bring back the most kick butt member of the team while mixing in some of the other Marvel Universe characters. Right from the beginning the film just hooks you in with a very cool montage of various wars that Wolverine/Logan fought in with his close friend Victor Creed. But all falls apart when the rogue mercenary team goes too far and drives Logan away. The plot is perfect and has an amazing pace, and still manages to deliver incredible action sequences, fights, and Wolverine kicking serious butt even more and better than he did with X-Men. If by a third entry a character is usually reaching it's climax they proved they can rise away from that and made him even better than he was by the third installment of his original trilogy.<br/><br/>As stated before Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine. He made this character so real to fans of comic and film alike that no one could ever replace him. Best of all Jackman is a terrific actor so he delivers a great performance with depth and mystery and looks great doing it. He is amazing simply put. Liev Schreiber bursts onto the screen as Victor Creed otherwise and gradually known as Sabretooth. Schreiber has had decent roles in the past but he really nails this role and fits into the character flawlessly. Best of all Schreiber and Jackman have great chemistry so the story of their friendship and rivalry plays out perfectly. If they continue this worthwhile franchise Schreiber should be the only choice to return as Sabretooth. Character actor Danny Huston is a great villain of sorts as Logan's former mentor who plays such a huge role in Wolverine's existence as we quickly learn. I didn't think they used Huston or his character as much as they could have. The supporting cast were all so terrific that they have so much more to build on that they could milk this for YEARS!! Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney, Ryan Reynolds (very underused as Deadeye...so much more to be done with him) and a quick cameo by a young Scott Summers (Cyclops) played by Tim Pocock. I leave the performance by Taylor Kitsch to last as he brought my favorite X-Men to life finally...Gambit. He was terrific and nailed the role and yet was sadly underused!! He could support his own film and I think Kitsch could do it! <br/><br/>The fact that many of the characters were ""underused"" in my opinions is NOT the fault of the film makers. In fact quite the opposite. This film was about exactly what it was meant to be Wolverine and his origins, the fact that his path crossed with all these amazing characters was not bogged down by their own individual stories and perhaps it leaves the perfect entries to future installments of X-Men, or Wolverine, or any other character films without being repetitive or boring. Character actor himself, but fairly new director Gavin Hood obviously has a lot of talent in telling a story and he must be a comic lover because he nails these characters down. The action is intense, the story is amazing and it was one of the best action films of the summer and got it started to a phenomenal start. 9/10"

","Prior to seeing this movie I had heard a lot of bad reviews and negative rumors about the movie. It was a movie I had been looking forward to long before this bad reputation started to spread - so I was a bit unsure of what to believe. I pretty much sat down to watch this movie preparing myself for that it might not be that great. After 1 hour and 47 minutes I was positively surprised. If you are a fan of the X-Men film trilogy I would recommend you to see this movie. I deem the X-Men trilogy as a good bunch of movies, I would rate them variously as 6's or 7's. Compared to those I actually think this is a tad more interesting a movie. Perhaps because Wolverine and Gambit are my favorite X-Men characters(I used to have Gambit as a toy when I was a kid! Loved him from the animated series I saw during the 90's). Would have been nice if they had included Gambit some more. In my opinion it was too many mutants with too little screen time and character development each. Despite this the movie is interesting and action filled with the most important characters being explored properly.<br/><br/>This movie seem to be as underrated as No Country for Old Men was overrated (not saying the latter isn't good - just not That good!). This is a movie worth seeing and I'd grade it a neat 7.5 - giving it an 8 on IMDb because it's underrated."

","With the exception of the third installment, the previous X-men films have been of a good standard. So when i heard they would be bringing out an origin movie i thought it was a good idea to give the characters some background and it sounded interesting. Consequently i went to see this at the cinema and it was a waste of time and money. Although close to the end i did catch up on some sleep as we all know what's going to happen and it's the usual rubbish. Only worse. I never bothered to look into it too deeply but it's full of plot holes which almost worsen the previous X-men movies. Even from the start we are shown what looks like a childish montage of battles. There are lots of action scenes but they're boring and no where near as exciting as they should be. Even when we reach the climax that's completely OTT with a fight on top of a Nuclear reactor, as if we were on the edge of our seats hoping our Hero wouldn't fall off. Then the God awful special effects kick in. There's nothing about this film to like and there are plenty of better ""hero"" films out there. (Iron man, Incredible Hulk etc.) Again, don't waste your time with this mess."

Even though there are clich√© scenes that make one or two in the crowd chuckle, it still fulfills what anyone would expect from an X-Men motion picture.

"RCWjr","7","3","7","7 July 2009"," A fitting origin
","I have read many reviews that have blasted this origin film from the X-men franchise. Frankly, I don't see all the fuss. Jackman once again owns the character and he is surrounded by other folks having a blast. What more do you want? I am not an X-men expert. I have never read any of the comics. I grew up on the 1980's cartoon series. So I don't bring any fan-boy expectations to these film. In all honesty, I felt this film was better than the first X-men movie. X-men 2 still stands as the best of the franchise, but Wolverine and Last Stand are equal 2nd's in my book followed by the first film.<br/><br/>There are many new characters thrown at us in the film. I think that is what folks have an issue with that have seen fit to moan and groan about this film. I need only point out the fact that this is called ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". My favorite X-men is finally introduced here, Gambit. He has little screen time, yet as much as I would have loved to see more of him (what we get is great), I came to see Wolverine's origin, not anyone else's. To that, we are actually given the origins of Sabertooth, though one that differs from the classic mythos (he is Logan's brother). The opening credits sequence quickly and efficiently catches us up on the brothers as they go through time taking part in all of the large wars fought this side of the equator.<br/><br/>The effects are, in some places, marginal, yet in others blow you away (Gambit's card and stick effects are fantastic). Acting across the board is spot on. Ryan Reynolds makes you wish for more from his Dead Pool character (which I hear is pretty close to happening as a stand-alone film). All others bring their A-game and help make this an enjoyable film. <br/><br/>The complaints are small; all in all, a worthy addition to the franchise. Enough with this Magneto origins talk, give us a Gambit origin!"
"tayz9230","6","3","7","24 May 2009"," A good comic book adaptation film, and sits on par with The Last Stand
","While I've heard many negative things about X-Men Origins: Wolverine, seriously I found it difficult to find one good comment of this film here on IMDb, coming from a die-hard X-Men fans but a not-so Wolverine fan, this movie rocks! Sure it does take some liberties, one that annoyed me, but that didn't ruin the film for me, is that they made Silver Fox and Emma Frost sisters. Now, I haven't read every single X-Men comic ever produced, but I find it hard to believe that those two ever interacted before, so why make them sister. I'll tell you why: it was nothing more than a cheap plot piece to throw Emma Frost into the movie, while at the same time giving her a slightly bigger cameo than other mutants thrown in just for fun. I've also read some comments about people complaining that Sabretooth and Wolverine aren't brothers, so why are they in the movie. Another cheap plot piece? No. You can't blame this movie for that element of the story because they didn't just pull it out of the sky. A Wolverine centric comic book mini-series released only a few years ago made them brothers. So if you don't like that, you can't blame this movie. They're only trying to be as current as possible. While this movie is chalk full of pointless plot devices only made to throw more cameos in, the aforementioned Emma/Silver relationship, as well as having Cyclops and Gambit involved with Weapon X, which I'm pretty sure never happened in the comics. So the bottom line boils down to: this movie is good. It's probably 3rd on my ranking of X-Men films, ahead of the first but still behind The Last Stand and X2, but it still is enjoyable. I was surprised I liked it so much, being as I don't really care for Wolverine. But the only problem with this movie is the writers deciding to rewrite X-Men history, as a way to throw in characters who should have bigger roles in the film series, but just don't fit in this film all that well."

","Marvel Comics has taken great steps in bringing along their film franchise, growing their characters and getting them ready for the 'bigtime' spotlight formerly reserved for the likes of 'Batman' and 'Superman'. With the past success of such Marvel titans 'X-Men & X-2', 'Spider-Man', 'Hulk' and now 'Iron Man', the 'X-Men Origin' series is expected to catapult the ensemble into their own tales of derring do... however 'Wolverine' didn't hit the mark. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" marks the first of the 'Origin' line which we already know has sequels for separate characters such as Deadpool and Magneto in the works, but being the first, it felt rushed. Wolverine is already a mainstay, especially on film as he dominated the ensemble 'X-Men' series all on his own, but his first 'solo' film just seemed really smushed together for a lack of better phrasing. Yes, the origin tale place-setting of he and Sabertooth (excellently played by Liev Schriber), the Weapon X Project (Roman numeral 10, fool) and Striker plus the path-crossing heavyweights such as Cyclops, Professor-X, several members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (comic wise anyway) and the like... too many deaths of characters who should have carried on, too little emphasis on what are actual comic plot points... it just came off as a little messy. Please don't get wrong, Jackman does his usual best with his fave character to play and will do so again in the upcoming sequel... but the play itself of events is just too much (or too little depending on which plot point). Still a viable film in the Marvel Universe, it will definitely serve as a blockbuster to get the ball rolling on the 'Origins' series and renew interest in the still to come 'X-Men: First Class', but to this comic book geek who adores the original ideas of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, et al; this film just veers a little too much off course. Just shy of comic epic, bring the popcorn and skip the bathroom breaks."
"Floated2","7","3","7","9 May 2009"," it was pretty good
","Before watching this movie, i didn't have much high expectations like other people. I expected it to be alright, I didn't think it was going to be better than the first 2 xmen movies, and i was right. This movie is pretty decent, not as bad as people say, but not as good. All of X-men movies are pretty enjoyable and entertaining. The recent movie, X-men 3 is loud and entertaining at best. Now comes X-men origins: Wolverine is a prequel. It does its job to entertain people with its brutal and intense fight/action scenes and people will be engaged in the warped and mixed feelings of the mutants especially Wolverine. He has a tragic past that makes people feel sorry for him. We get the ruthless Victor Creed, who is known as Sabretooth, not being as cold-hearted as I thought. <br/><br/>The story: Everything has its own past. Logan known as Wolverine is happy living his life working as a lumberjack and seeing his girlfriend everyday. Until then, William Stryker comes and destroy their lives. Wolverine becomes revengeful. I can't spoil the twists and turns or major story plot to those who are not familiarized with the story. The pace moves briskly. It is action-packed with some explosive action and also packed with mutants like well-know Gambit and Deadpool. Although the characters were kind of underused. They didn't show much of Gambit until near the end of the movie. But i guess that's why its called Xmen origins: Wolverine, because its about Wolverine's past and life. Some parts were confusing though.<br/><br/>Overall: IMO Xmen origins: Wolverine is somewhere in the middle where you can enjoy watching it. Those who are not familiarized with the Wolverine's origins and want to know should catch this. Those who cannot get enough of X-men movies should be able to enjoy this or not. It is not the best or the worst marvel comic movie. As a rewatch (09/24/17') opinions remain same as this film does what is it supposed to. Decent and solid action superhero movie with an interesting story."

","Being an X-fan of some 17 years standing I expected to either love or hate this movie. What I didn't expect was to be indifferent to it and yet I was. After an amazing start where Wolverine's relationships with Victor Creed (Sabretooth) and Stryker, amongst others, were beautiful explored the third act was a huge let down. What should have been the strongest act was flabby compared to the tight plotting and character development of the fist two acts. It wasn't helped by the fact that there was pointless exposition of the Scott Summers (Cyclops) character and a game of spot the X-men going on. Also characters that had little to do with the film were given too much screen time and exposition that could easily have been handle by Wraith was given to the Blob. It became a distraction because I was sat there wondering what the point of some scenes were rather than being swept away by the universe that the film was trying to create All in all the performances were solid and I really enjoyed the interactions between Huge Jackman (Wolverine) and Liev Schreiber (Sabretooth) but it just wasn't enough to make up for some of the small irritations in the third act. Sadly this movie should have been excellent but it ended up being just mediocre."

","I have to say prior to leaving for the theatre to see Wolverine I checked IMDb as I often do and most the reviewers are dead wrong. Everyone thinks they could make a better movie couch critics, hasn't anyone just gone to the movies to get a good evening of fun and thrills do we all have to dissect every aspect. I love movies and can be very critical of them especially those in a series that take my intelligence and the very mythos already established for granted. This movie doesn't do that it gives a qualified back story and still manages to align itself with the other movies in the series. BTW its no over produced by any Hollywood standard to say that about this movie would be to say that about Harry Potter, Transformers etc. Liev Shrieber is excellent and Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. I hate when people give away to much so I won't do that suffice to say seeing Gambit realized was a treat as a big fan of the Xmen comic and while the fusion of metal to Wovlerines body was quite tame in comparison to the comic version of the story its OK after all this is a movie it can't be the same. My partner in crime at this movie is not a big fan of action but has seen all the Xmen movies his comment at the end was ""this was much better than Xmen III""...I may not be able to say the same thing but just goes to show you see it for yourself you won't feel like you wasted your money...you may even be glad you saw it on the Big Screen.

Taylor was an excellent Gambit but Emma Frost shouldn't had appeared.<br/><br/>I hope they would make a sequel and make it even better."

","The summer blockbuster movie season is upon us. After months (seemingly years) of endless promotion Wolverine...X Men: Origins, has finally slashed its way onto the big screen. Let me first start out by saying that I have not read any of the Wolverine comics, never was the biggest fan of X Men. But Wolverine is a pretty cool character and so I wanted to see where he came from. We find out where he came from all right, but it is not very clear as to how someone who is born in the 1840's is alive and kicking today. We understand that Wolverine has regenerative powers (only from previous X men films and if you hasn't seen those, you would be lost) but regenerative powers does not longevity make, or so I thought. He has all this longevity and can never die as well, except for cutting his head off. (If you just read that and think he's a vampire, I sympathize but you would be mistaken). I understand, it's a comic book movie and therefore you need more than the usual suspension of disbelief. However, that is a pretty important plot point to clue the audience in I would say. We learn all of this in a good montage in the opening credits where our hero Logan aka Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman (as if you didn't know by now) who's power is having his bones jut out of his hands like knives and his half brother Victor who also has the same longevity and regenerative powers but has claws and acts like a big cat and who's name is Sabretooth ( although they never say it, again you have to have watched the first X Men film for that) played by Liev Schreiber are seen fighting in the American Civil War, World Wars 1 and 2, Korea and Vietnam. The funny thing is, they are Canadian. Setting aside, nationality and historical semantics for a while, we also learn that Victor is a pretty sick cat (pun intended) and that Logan has to constantly remind him to chill. But, as fate would have it, Victor goes too far in Vietnam, which causes both him and Logan to be executed by a firing squad. Surprise, they don't die and are sent to a stockade instead. Enter, Colonel William Stryker (Danny Huston) who recognizes their powers and entices them to join his secret team of mutants to go on missions.<br/><br/>From here, the film becomes fairly predictable. We meet the team of mutants, including Wade, who is the most sarcastic of the bunch (played by Ryan Reynolds, who can't seem to play anything else and note to Ryan it is not cute, it's annoying as hell). They go on a certain mission in Africa which rubs Logan entirely the wrong way and he quits the team. Although, hasn't he learned from other action films, that you just can't quit a military operation without consequences. So, Logan becomes a lumberjack in British Columbia, meets and falls in love with a school teacher when his past comes calling. Obviously he turns it down, but when tragedy strikes, Logan is hell bent on revenge. Victor is back to his old killing tricks and it's up to Logan to take him down. But, Logan needs an edge in killing his older brother, so Stryker convinces Logan to let him experiment on him by injecting an indestructible metal (Adamantium) onto Logan's skeletal structure. Hence, the metallic claws are born. Here, Stryker wants to erase Logan's memories to make him an obedient soldier. Logan overhears this while underwater and decides he wants no part of it. He escapes and the adventure truly begins.<br/><br/>From here, the film descends into predictable Hollywood formulaic action plot twists about Logan being double crossed and going after both Victor and Stryker and meeting other mutants along the way, including a fan favorite...Gambit who for some reason was not in the previous 3 X Men films. They did a good job with the ending, which helps explain why Logan, in the other X Men films, doesn't seem to remember who or what he is. There is a pretty comical sequence with The Blob (Kevin Durand).<br/><br/>Wolverine is a typical action film, so I will not be overly critical of the acting but I give Hugh Jackman a lot of credit. This is his 4th time brandishing Wolverine's claws and he didn't phone it in and still gave a lot of life to his character. Liev Schreiber did a good job as the villainous Victor and Danny Huston was also pretty good as Stryker. They all seemed to understand their characters and lived out their imaginary circumstances fairly well. The writing for the most part was better than the previous X Men films but for some reason the folks who write X Men films, have a terrible time with catchy one liners (see Halle Berry in the first X Men for probably the worst one liner ever). Aside from that, Gavin Hood did a good job with the directing. If you are a big action buff, you will not be disappointed. For me, the Dark Knight is still the new gold standard for comic book films and Wolverine is not in its league and it's not supposed to be and that's alright. Wolverine is a good popcorn film."
"TheHande","7","3","7","3 May 2009"," Walking a fine line
","The Wolverine movie tries to balance itself at being a serious telling of the character's origin story and a fun summer block buster at the same time. While the film definitely succeeds on both fronts it doesn't quite match the seriousness and intent of the first three movies.<br/><br/>The exploration in to Wolverine and Sabertooth's relationship is one of the more rewarding experiences out of the film from a story point of view as well as seeing the origins of the character's name and the ultimate decision to have his skeleton covered by nigh-indestructible metal. All of the back-story works well but the scene where Logan finally loses his memory felt like a bit of an anti-climax especially after the shocking plot-twist concerning Kayla.<br/><br/>The action scenes are once again brilliant and the element of comedy is very welcome in the film. I also have to admit to liking all the new mutant characters, no matter how briefly they appear. Wade Wilson was fun and Deadpool provides the coolest part of the film's latter half (and making me wish that Baraka from the second Mortal Kombat film would have looked more like him). But while the more entertaining parts of the film are handled even-handedly with the story-drive ones they unfortunately do undermine the film just a tad bit.<br/><br/>Typical fan complaints aside, Wolverine is a good action film and a well-handled retelling of the character's origin story but not a film that can match the message of the first three X-Men films."
"davinlane","Null","3","7","2 May 2009"," Horrible to the comic book fans, and passable to the average movie goer.
","The beginning started very strong. The childhood and war scenes were done to perfection in my opinion. The ""Special Team"" (not yet called the Weapon X Project) they were in was great as well. Danny Huston as William Stryker was great. He even kinda looks like Brian Cox (William Stryker from X2) a bit. I could not have been happier with Ryan Reynolds portrayal of Wade Wilson (Deadpool). He truly was ""The Merc With A Mouth"". Liev Schreiber was masterfull as Victor Creed (Sabertooth). Agent Zero was a good bad ass. I particularly liked seeing a little more of what he could do at the beginning so that you really understood how menacing he could be. Will i Am (Mastadon) was pretty good, I never thought we saw enough of him in the comics. Kevin Durand as Frederick J. Dukes (The Blob) was terrible. He is an amazing actor but it was too (If you'll forgive the pun) comical. The movie did not need that. Also Blob was not part of Weapon X. Dominic Monaghan (Bolt) was good at the part he did but completely unnecessary to the story. Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox (Silverfox) was good. She did her part very well and they kept her part kinda short which I liked because you don't wanna overload an action movie with too much romance (Star Wars Episode II, I'm talking to you). It was sweet, to the point, and it did it's job.<br/><br/>Moving on to a big disappointment was Taylor Kitsch as Remy LeBeau (Gambit). First thing you notice about Gambit is his eyes. Black eyes, red irises, and black pupils. This is what Gambit should have looked like. To be honest getting Sawyer from Lost would have been a much better Gambie to me. Taylor could not keep a Cajun accent to save his life in this movie, it was just missing entirely in scenes.<br/><br/>The kid playing Scott Summers (Cyclops) had almost no lines at all, and did very little acting. It is impossible to know if he is a good actor, or just well directed based on what you see in the movie.<br/><br/>The other mutants weren't seen long enough to comment on them with the exception of one. Tahyna Tozzi as Kayla's sister Emma was interesting. I have no idea if she is an existing Marvel character but she at least held my attention. The animation they used to make her look like diamonds was staggering. I only wish they had used it on Hugh Jackman's claws which looked cartoonish in many scenes (Mainly in the old folks bathroom).<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman who this entire story rested upon. As Logan (Wolverine) he did his normal job of making him look mean. I could have done without the scream after Silverfox appeared dead (it looked too fake). I do understand why it needed to be done though. Jackman has always been an above average Wolverine (just above passable). It might have helped if he had read the comics growing up, but one can't have perfection and we sure aren't gonna get it here.<br/><br/>Now the worst thing they did to this movie, Weapon XI. I was unhappy that Ryan Reynolds did not play Weapon XI (Deadpool). I can only hope it was because of what they did to the character and he said he would not do it. I have only seen Scott Adkins in Mutant X back in 2002. I'm sure his acting was great for what they asked him to do but what they asked him to do was nothing less than the rape of the character. Deadpool had the ability to regenerate and teleport, but not Cyclops's eye beams (which factor heavily into the final fight sequence). They also decided to graft skin over Deadpool's mouth. He was called the Merc With A Mouth. He always talked a lot and pushed people's buttons. That was a major flaw. The final thing is the swords. This looks like someone saw BloodRayne and said ""I like that, Let's do that to our character"". Deadpool did not have swords that came out of his wrists. It made sense for Wolverine to have metal claws because of the bone ones he was born with.<br/><br/>The last 10 minutes of this movie ruined the whole thing for me. I could have gotten my head around everything else but that. I went to this movie for 3 things. Leiv Schreiber as Sabertooth, Gambit, and Deadpool. One out of 3 was done correctly. It also seems they went out of their way to ruin it with that last scene and it looked unfinished because of the look of Wolverin's claws. All in all I say this was not worth the $8.50 I paid to see it. It will also not be worth the rental. If you must see this movie wait for the dollar theater."
"Prichards12345","6","3","7","30 April 2009"," Quality Prequel Not Without Some Flaws
","Hugh Jackman turns in another good performance as Logan in a film that'll probably provoke love/hate reactions if I'm honest. Fans of the comics may point out that many of the supporting characters like Gambit, Deadpool and Cyclops appear only briefly, with a few lines of back story and a short sequence displaying their powers to not much effect- they'd be right, but the general cinema audience won't care too much about this. By and large the movie works, has some goodish action sequences, and allows Jackman to occasionally show the character's gentler side.<br/><br/>Wolverine's back story informs us he's over 150 years old, has a brother with a much meaner streak (a glowering Liev Schreiber)and beefs up his relationship with Stryker, familiar to us from X2 as the general in charge of the Weapon X project. Marvel is all about character development in their super-heroes, and Wolverine is no exception. Jackman doesn't hog the film but shines throughout.<br/><br/>It starts like a war movie, throwing in a bit of Saving Private Ryan for good measure, and then jaunts around a lot, in the manner of Rise Of The Silver Surfer. There's even a Ma and Pa Kent kind of sequence, and a right old dig at D.C. comics homely upbringing of Superman. At least that's the way I read it.<br/><br/>The story largely concerns Wolverine's desire to have revenge on his brother for killing his partner, and what he's prepared to go through to get it. There's nothing new here but the relationship of the two brothers is at the centre of the movie, and works very well. Jackman and Schreiber play off each other splendidly.<br/><br/>William Stryker, clearly using Wolverine for his own ends, infuses Logan's bones with Adamantium, making him virtually indestructible.<br/><br/>There's a neat helicopter battle with Agent Zero and an excellent action packed climax to the movie. The effects and cinematography are somewhat variable - Agent Zero's hill sequence is rather poorly done, for example, though elsewhere the effects are fine.There's also two very brief post credit sequences and another version floating around out there with Deadpool re-combining but this wasn't in the print I saw.<br/><br/>Just try to forget about the bout with The Blob, which is meant to be comic but clashes strongly with the tone of the movie in general. Blob looks like Fat Bastard from Austin Powers. Some of the super-powered characters are underdeveloped and just exactly what their powers are aren't always clear. Gambit, a character I'm not familiar with, left me a little confused.<br/><br/>Still, there's life in Ol' Wolvie yet. He's still the best at what he does."
"silva_apple","7","3","7","30 April 2009"," It *is* a decent movie!
","Seen it yesterday in the movies. And despite me not being without critic for the endprodukt I did enjoy the movie! Hugh Jackman did a great job. Not that I thought that it would be any different. But he definitely did. And the product what an enjoyable movie that at no time felt overly long. Rather to the contrary. (But more to that later).<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Liev Schreiber's balanced insanity. To a degree that you were never really sure whether to like of hate him. Yes Sabretooth is supposed to the *Bad* Guy. At least one of them. He is the animalistic Side that Wolverine always fought against. But that also makes him fun. He is more a Soldier of Fortune. He is willing to kill for the order and he doesn't care what or who. He is bad but he isn't evil. And the fighting scenes with Wolverine (with or against) are just great.<br/><br/>The story is OK and although I might have been able to say certain lines before they were spoken (without being a mutant myself ; ) ) I do credit that to the fact that this was not the first movies that I have seen like that.<br/><br/>The movie definitely gave you laughs and they were at the scenes they were supposed to be.<br/><br/>However where the movie didn't really pull though was the promise it makes from the Trailer and the movie posters.<br/><br/>The movie is a TWO man show.<br/><br/>And this is where the movie feels short. You want to see more of those other mutants. Especially those that where promised in the Trailer.<br/><br/>All other mutants are if they are lucky a bit more than a glimpse on the movie screen.<br/><br/>Where it unfortunately was most visible was with Deadpool and Gambit.<br/><br/>Scott Summers you didn't expect to be a big role since he was barley featured in the Trailer. But frankly he had as much role as Gambit and a bigger role than Deathpool.<br/><br/>Heck Bolt hat more screen time and he wasn't in neither trailer now Poster. (And he was unfortunately pretty much wasted with the early killing.)<br/><br/>Actually most of the killing where pretty stupid. The attack scene of ""John Wraith"" against Sabretooth was pretty much predictable as of it's conclusion.<br/><br/>Thing is what angers me is that we get a pretty nice glimpse of Gambit. And what I saw, I liked.<br/><br/>And that why I give 7 out of 10. It gave me what it promised a movie about the origin of Wolverine and that part I completely enjoyed. It didn't give me what the Trailer and the Poster promised."

","Oh man. Um, It was a ""film"", I suppose. The acting is quite unsavory- Will.I.Am ... jeez. It was like watching a middle school play directed by Uwe Boll. If you're a fan, go ahead- see the movie. The action is very over the top, and the drama is so predictable, you'll be mouthing the words before the title even appears on screen. It is a shame- I enjoyed the X-Men movies, and this... well, this is something else. There are a lot of good names in this movie, and to see the ""origins"" is an interesting perspective. In an industry so saturated with canonical, money-making ""films"" that get shoved out the door, with nothing behind it but money grubbing producers, it is nice to see the backgrounds, and how these characters came to be.

Its intense war scenes near the beginning were amazing to watch. I love the how they showed different wars. Extremely interesting. I also enjoyed how sabertooth was more than just a growling animal as they portrayed him in the first X-men movie. I wish they made more origin stories to do with other characters.

","Like the headline suggest, if you are already a fan of Wolverine or Hugh or Comics, you will like this film This movie starts with Victor and his sick younger brother James in 1845 Canada. James kills the man who claims to be his father. The brothers fight together from one war to the next. In Vietnam, the brothers are supposed to be executed but end up recruited by Stryker (Danny Huston) joining a group of other mutants. James aka Logan (Hugh Jackman) quits the group leaving Victor (Liev Schreiber) for a life of a lumberjack with girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Victor is hunting down the old team, and Stryker comes by to try to bring Logan back in. When Victor kills Kayla, Logan wants revenge and he's willing to get back in with Stryker who infuses him with adamantium.<br/><br/>It's a lot of growling testosterone without the lighter moments. It's all about Logan's anger without any fun or comedy. Liev is fine and I would like to dig more into his character. They've put quite a few X-Men in this movie. It is probably trying to cover too much origins in this movie. This should be more Cain and Abel. Victor should be as important in this movie. This movie needs a good storyteller and not just somebody to check off a checklist. I'm not sure director Gavin Hood is the man for the job. The movie becomes overloaded."

","Let me start by saying that I love the X-Men series. However, i have not nor do I intend to read the comics. Comics aren't my thing, so I'm reviewing this strictly as a film fan, not a comic fan. I don't understand why this movie has a bad rap. It's got a good story, good acting, and great action sequences. It tells the backstory of Logan/Wolverine and his evil brother Victor, before Logan became part of the X-Men. This movie isn't perfect. But it's far better than X3, which has some pretty major flaws, but is good nonetheless. It's a close second to X2 and First Class, which to me are the best two in the series. I have not yet seen Days of Future Past so I can't compare it to that. This movie is worth a view, it's entertaining and fun, and Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine, they couldn't have picked anyone better to play him. Liev Schreiber is also very good in this, as Logan's half-brother and nemesis, Victor. 9/10 stars"
"chai772","1","2","4","30 June 2012"," Drama Sacrificed For Action (not the film I wanted to see)
","To begin with, I must admit that whilst I'm not a comic book enthusiast, I am a fan of the limited series, ""Origin"" - a 6 part graphic novel from which this film, ""X Men Origins: Wolverine"" draws heavily and against which it commits heinous crimes.<br/><br/>As a child I was intrigued by the enigma of Wolverine, a character shrouded in mystery. So mysterious was he, that his personal history was never revealed in order to keep readers guessing. The eventual and much awaited release of ""Origin"" helped clarify details of Wolverine's life, and although non canon, certain elements of it were deemed kosher enough to be adapted into a live motion picture. But beware! This film adaptation of ""Origin"" only glossed over the fine details and the real essence behind the story was lost, turning it into nothing more than an average Hollywood popcorn flick!<br/><br/>In the graphic novel ""Origin,"" writers Bill Jemas, Joe Quesada and Paul Jenkins present a stunning drama which strips bare the human heart and reveals mankind's animalistic nature. When considered an abhorrence by his family, James Howlett has no choice but to run away, accompanied only by his close friend Rose. Their escape leads them to a quarry in British Columbia, where James finds work and begins to understand what he is. Here, he begins to realise that society would never accept him as a mutant and a monster. So James periodically escapes in the night to hunt amongst wolves, a brotherhood with whom he can safely and secretly manifest his violent rage. <br/><br/>Wolverine is such a complex character. Any attempt made by an uninspired director to ""pick n' mix"" elements from differing comic book series and amalgamate them under the banner of ""X- Men Origins"" is a great injustice done to both Wolverine and the X-Men. In this case, the opportunity of an interesting character study, such as the ""relationship between animal and man"" was sorely missed. Instead, the writers chose to forego dramatic elements in favour of clich√© high-intensity action scenes involving explosions, guns and motorbikes.<br/><br/>At a time when market competitors, DC Comics, are approving well researched and inspired adaptations such as ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" the production of ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" should be a shameful embarrassment for Marvel Studios."
"pouge162","5","2","4","11 March 2012"," Not a good adaption, at all...
","After reading the graphic novel, I had high hopes for this movie. I expected some changes to it, but not to this extent. It was horribly paced and mish mashed story lines. I was disappointed in the portrayal of Deadpool also. It was so bad, in fact, that Fox has said both following movies, Deadpool, and the next Wolverine movies will not be sequels to this film. Fans of this film are totally lost...It starts off rather well, same as the graphic novel. Then the producers/director just wave off a perfectly good storyline so they could hurry up and get Logan into his adamantium. When in fact, he shouldn't have gotten his adamantium skeleton until the sequel of this film. The novel follows him through the 19th century and has a very well done love triangle in it. These ""film makers"" decide they can do better, and get it all wrong. For me personally, it ranks down there with Halle Berry's Cat Woman. The die hard comic fans spoke out loudly after viewing this film, and along with many of them, I agree. a terrible waste of possibly a really good movie. For the next movie of Wolverine, they had best bring it. I mean, really? Adamantium bullets? The procedure was what made him lose his memory in the comics, and in the first film. Poor continuity...Very poor indeed. Save your money and watch X-Men 1&2 instead. Far superior movies."
"hpthedaywalker","1","2","4","23 August 2011"," An exercise in misunderstanding a character
","First of all let me say that I have not read the comic books and have absolutely no idea of how a the comic book's version of Wolverine's past is written.<br/><br/>But when that is said I have watched the 3 other x-men films and even though I wasn't a fan of either 1 or 2, and hated 3, I have always seen a great potential in these stories of misfits trying to adapt to a world that hates them and the whole thing of either teaching the world that all can co-exist or ripping the worlds tongue out through its' intestinal system. <br/><br/>And I really feel that this movies did option no.2 on the whole potential of at least Wolverine. Because the main flaw with this movie is not the bad action, the underwritten characters or even the ridicules twists every 5 minutes. The Main flaw is that the character of Wolverine is completely misunderstood. <br/><br/>We are in all the other movies (and the comic books i presume) led to believe that wolverine has this horrible past that has turned him into a man driven by anger, revenge and hate. This is what makes him the most interesting person of the x-men because he needs to learn how to control himself and become more human than a savage beast (the opposite of sabertooth). So if you want to show his past this past needs to be strong and scary for us to understand what Wolverine is fighting in his mind.<br/><br/>But nothing has gotten into making his past scary or give reason for his deep mental scars. X-men 2 showed the room he got his claws in and made it creepy as hell and showed flashes of a Wolverine suffering, bleeding and screaming. That's the past Wolverine needs to have for him to have any dept but in this movie the room is brightly lite and then one, two and a little ""auw"" he has the claws and escapes to do a bit of prat falling humor with his new claws, and the audience goes ""ahahaha oh look at that silly old fool he can't even control those claws!"". <br/><br/>You just do not believe that this guy will ever become the Wolverine that he is in the x-men films and worst of all you just don't care about him because nothing is dangerous. It becomes just another boring action flick with bad action an even worse story and the most unbelievably bad attempt at a sad romantic subplot as a reason for his mental scars.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend this to anyone. Not even if you just want action and do not care about the characters. It's bad. And the only mutant power it truly shows is the power to make your eyes and ears hurt."

","I have quite enjoyed all of the X-Men films, I can't say I was a fan of the comic books, but I do remember the animated TV shows. So I was intrigued to see the back story of one of the most memorable characters from the films. I can't say I was overly impressed, but I think that is due to the limitations the filmmakers were working under. But more of that later, here's a short synopsis first.<br/><br/>We begin with Logan as a young boy discovering that he has a mutation, at this time his claws are bone. He and his brother, Victor, escape after Logan murders his father and they fight side by side all through the American Civil War, World War I, World War II and Vietnam. Yes, they are both indestructible. We come to the present day and the pair is recruited to a special team run by Col. William Stryker, a shady character to say the least. After one particular mission where Victor goes too far, Logan turns his back on the team and goes to live in Canada. He lives a simple live with the love of his life, Kayla. Six years later Victor re-appears and starts murdering the remaining members of the team. He eventually comes after Logan and ends up killing Kayla. Swearing vengeance, Logan is approached by Stryker who says he can give him the tools to beat Victor. Logan agrees and his body is infused with the rare metal alloy called adamantium. Now with his metal claws Logan is turned on by Stryker and is on the run. He eventually discovers exactly what Stryker has been doing and it's not good news for mutants. I'll leave it there, don't want to give the ending away.<br/><br/>This film was OK, the effects and stunts were very well done but it did suffer from two problems. First of all I felt they tried to fit too much into the plot which meant that many things were only half explained, or the audience was left to fill in some gaping plot holes. The second problem was the fact that it only had a 12A certificate here in the UK. This meant the level of violence was very limited and this was to the determent of the film in my opinion. There's lots of talk on the DVD about Wolverine being more 'Bad-Ass' in this film, but you just didn't see it on the screen. If it had been a 15 certificate I'm sure it would have been a very different movie.<br/><br/>Having said that, the performances all round were pretty good, so honourable mentions go to Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine, Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed, Danny Huston as Col. William Stryker and Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox.<br/><br/>Over all, it's a pretty entertaining film despite the rather confusing plot. Some great action sequences and all the CGI bells and whistles we've come to expect from these films. If you're a fan of the X-Men films then it's recommended, otherwise, maybe not.<br/><br/>My score: 5.6/10"

I found only two good things about this movie. 1: Ryan Reynolds cast as Deadpool, or what they seem to think deadpool is, and Liev Schreibers great performance as Victor. Everything else upset me.<br/><br/>They put so much focus on wolverine and Victor that they put no effort into the others.

Gambit's accent was so faint i didn't even know he was using one until a few minutes of hearing him talk. Deadpool never even puts on a mask, and in the end his mouth is sewn, therefore taking away his smart @$$ commenting. If they left his mouth alone, he could make fun of the two Ferral mutants while beating the crap out of them, which is what he does, but the production team obviously knows nothing about X-Men.<br/><br/>Also, the graphics and special effects were horrible. The claws looked more real in the first X Men made 9 years ago. the background green screen helped nothing. People were so mad when the unfinished version was leaked and said ""Oh well you think it sucks because there's no finished effects in that version."" well its not much better even with all that. This movie also takes away any possible future projects for Gambit joining the X-Men because this is so long before the X Men are created. This movie upset me... Bull****! Bull****! F*** this movie Bull****!"

","I never got into the original X-Men movie. It actually bored me. I wasn't able to develop a relationship with any of the characters. There was no connection. All I basically remember is that Patrict Stewart was the good guy taking care of the ""good"" mutants and Ian McKellan taking care of the ""bad"" mutants. This movie, on the other hand, had more emotion. Though I never learn how Victor and his brother Jimmy(Liev Schreiber and Hugh Jackman) become mutants, it becomes a side story to the main storyline. This story is actually about the relationship between the two brothers. They become useful to the US Army as mercenaries along with 6 or more others. Victor begins to thrive on the adrenaline while Jimmy begins to abhor it. He quits and begins looking for quiet place to live, which turns out to be logging country in the north west. Of course his solitude is destroyed which leads to a show down with Victor. Although ordered to, Victor refuses to kill him, After all, they are still brothers. It seems to be the only thing Victor refuses to do."

","This is pure fantasy folks, the very title tells you that. It is also from a comic book. When I was a lad the only super-heroes we had was Superman & Batman. When they made film adaptations, they were 12-15 chapters seen only on Saturday Matinees. Each chapter ended in a cliff-hanging scene & you had to come back next week to see what happened.<br/><br/>In this day & age they spend over 100 Million dollars per film. The serials were pretty bad, BUT as kids we loved them.<br/><br/>That is enough history, we must comment on the present film.<br/><br/>It is good entertainment; at least the first 80 minutes are, the last 25 minutes does have the tendency to drag, not fatally though. The special effects (computer generated) are first rate. The acting by all is good. The director was Gavin Hood,The screenplay was written by David Benioff & Skip Ward, The cast does have some of the better performers of today.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is Wolverine & he is most effective. He better be cause the two villains are equally good. Liev Schrieber & Danny Huston fit these parts like a glove. Ryan Reynolds,Dominic Monaghan & Will i. Am are other mutants. Lynn Collins is the required female in the cast.<br/><br/>This is a good action, special effect film for the entire family. The violence is pure comic book. This is fantasy sit back & enjoy.<br/><br/>Ratings: *** (out of 4) 87 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)"
"caelbarrow-1","8","2","4","28 October 2009"," Great Action, Great Characters, Great Film!
","I went to see the new X-Men flick and I was really hoping to be blown away. And I was. I was thinking more of a boring old origins movie where there's more dialog than action but this proved me wrong. There is plenty of action to go around and there is still dialog to describe what's going on! The effects are not all that flash in some cases but the action scenes are pretty awesome.<br/><br/>Also what I liked wast that it was kind of like a brother vs brother type thing. With Victor Creed/Sabretooth (although Sabretooth is not mentioned at all in the entire movie) is killing off other characters from their old mercenary team. The team was Logan/Wolverine, Victor Creed/Sabretooth, Chris Bradley/Bolt, David North/Agent Zero, Fred Dukes/The Blob, John Wraith, and of course my favorite Wade Wilson/Deadpool. But not many of them survive this film.<br/><br/>Like I said before, my favorite character is Deadpool, I was thinking that his role was like more than an hour or something or was at least a main character. But instead he only really stars for about 15-20 minutes which was really disappointing. It also doesn't really end well for Wade Wilson/Deadpool after he gets decapitated by Wolverine.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, I thought X-Men Origins:Wolverine was fantastic and one of the best in the series!"
"revival05","4","2","4","13 October 2009"," A big budget version of a direct-to-DVD spin-off
","Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history. I'm no Marvel expert, but I did grow up with the adventures of the X-Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan. I enjoyed the first X-Men, found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment. All through the three movies, I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else. I figured the idea of making an ""origins""-movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X-Men movies. If we concentrate on one character, I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure.<br/><br/>The reason that the Wolverine-movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight. It's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly isn't good - no, it's because the movie doesn't even seem to try. To begin with, this does not qualify as good entertainment. There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very, very automatic. With no greater special effects or elements of suspense, and when one event will make you predict the following five, it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie, imitating an action/adventure movie concept that you've seen a dozen times before. Of course, nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls**t but when everybody's talking clich√©s as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard, you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough.<br/><br/>But there is an even bigger problem. Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and, by the way, that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities. I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title. I mean, ""Origins"". Really? What to the people behind this movie think about that title? What do they mean?? You want to know the origins of Wolverine? He grew up with his brother. They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances. Then they went off to war. All of them! The Civil War, World War I and II and Vietnam too. Why did they do this? Still unknown. Eventually, the brother (Sabertooth, played by Liev Shrieber) became evil. ""How?"" you ask. I don't know, it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi. ""Yeah, but why?"" you still ask. I just said I don't know!! The movie doesn't explain. He's evil alright! ""Yeah, but... you know, 'origins'""... Yeah, well that's an origin! I mean, duh! Anyway, eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers. Something with the government, ho-hum. Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother. For six years he's a happy lumberjack with a loved one, who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again. ""Yeaaah... but... whyyyy?"" - Oh shut up! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh-covered metal war animal. He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped, cue X-Men the first movie.<br/><br/>There. That's the origin. You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover. The actual movie won't tell you anything else. With no worthwhile scenes of action, no good heroes, villains or characters in general (lines from my couch audience: Fat suit! Token black guy! Oh, I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie.., That is supposed to be Gambit...? mmhm, yeah well... uh-huh, right), not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T-shirt with, added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive...... well, that sounds pretty much like a waste of time, right? Fans will check this out, or have already. There's no stopping that. But if you liked the X-Men movies for no other reason than that they were well-made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none."
"jhpstrydom","7","2","4","29 September 2009"," Good as an action film, not so good as a character story
","This film was not as much of character story as I thought it would be but it certainly wasn't a bad film, if seen as an action film its very entertaining, the action sequences feature big budget effects that for a change wasn't overdone, the effects added to the action without trying to be an overly spectacular visual effects feast which was actually really refreshing.<br/><br/>The character story is not as deep or complex as I expected, everything was kept very simple such as where the film portrays Wolverine and Sabertooth as brothers but it doesn't really broaden out the relationship and the back story of wolverine is only about events that happen to him and doesn't really expand on the character story.<br/><br/>However, this was good as an action film but disappointing for not really being much of a character story, I recommend it mainly for its entertainment value."
"griffinfinity","7","2","4","25 September 2009"," Origens of eXcellence...
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine For those who waited for this prequel to X-Men, it was worth every moment, every day of anticipation. For those who have never seen X-Men, well, this is a great place to start. In the grand tradition of the comic book, this edition features the origins of The Wolverine, the mutant who is at the core of the storyline. Let's remember this fact. It's not about the development of your other favorite mutants, this is Wolverine's story. I do not like to get into plot or storyline too heavily. I despise trailers with their 'let's show them the entire movie in split-second sequencing'. It's designed to monetize (ie: the all important first three days of release). The trailer is not for the viewer's benefit. You'll not get that in my reviews either.<br/><br/>There have been some excellent renditions of the 'Batman', 'Spider-man', and 'Watchmen' series' in recent years. With just the right mix of CGI, storytelling, and acting, we have reached new levels in the way comic books are depicted on film. Director, Gavin Hood, has taken these tools and designed an outstanding issue in this, the third installment of the series. The bar now rests at a higher level for those who follow. I enjoy director's who compete with their peers. When they get it right, amazing results are often achieved.<br/><br/>Like the original comic book series, a tale can be told with the flourish of great graphics, coupled with minimal, but carefully selected text, to achieve a creative and comprehensible story line. The great artist, Jack Kirby (Captain America, Fantastic Four), was the initial artist in the X-Men series. While not the creator of the 'Wolverine' character, I believe he would have approved of the camera work in 'Wolverine'. There is great stop action framing, perhaps homage to King Kirby. I also love the angles used in shooting. In many cases, the distant view of the entire scene is shown, much like in the comic books.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman stars as 'Logan/Wolverine'. He is perfect in every frame. The effort that Jackman has put into this portrayal is clear. He has turned himself into a physical specimen rarely seen in a starring role since Bruce Lee in 'Enter The Dragon'. Add to this his powerful ability to project dialog in any manner and its clear Jackman is far beyond the coveted 'triple threat' that most entertainers aspire to be. His turns on-stage as 'Curly' in Oklahoma, 'Peter Allen' on Broadway, and film roles in 'Van Helsing' and ' The Prestige' solidify that fact. For good measure, he was the song and dance, comedic host of the 2008 Academy Awards show.<br/><br/>There is excellent supporting talent at every turn in this production. Liev Schreiber is particularly nasty as the 'hell bent' Victor Creed. Musician, Will.i.Am, Kevin Durand and Taylor Kitsch all lend nice supporting roles as well. I particularly liked Lynn Collins, as Logan's love interest Kayla.<br/><br/>Dominic Monaghan (Lost) lit the way as mutant 'Bolt'. He was joined by and 'A-Team' group of mutants that put on an excellent display of their superpowers. Rounding out the team was Tim Pocock, Ryan Reynolds (as Hal Jordan/The Green Lantern' in production), and Daniel Henney. Their scenes epitomize what many comic readers love to see in the pages, action packed, and jaw dropping abilities. They did not disappoint here.<br/><br/>Technical The Blu-ray edition is vibrant and exceptional at 1924 X 1080p, 120Hz. The sound is fine on all levels at 5.1, dts-HD. The special features are many. They include the customary commentary with the director (Gavin Hood), a great feature with Stan Lee and former writer Len Wein. The back and forth banter is pure gold for fans. So many tidbits of fascinating information are thrown at you, seemingly as afterthoughts. Also included are 'Ultimate X-mode' (ability to sit in the director's chair, pre-visualize Wolverine and X-Facts), a helicopter scene, insight segment, and an alternate ending. The language options are English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. The subtitles available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Cantonese."
"Rizar","Null","2","4","21 September 2009"," Wolverine Back as an Outsider
","The mysterious Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is back as his old conflicted self. The third X-Men movie (""X-Men: The Last Stand"", 2006) made him into a pathetic team player, taught him his manners and how to be a socially acceptable sheep of the collective. This movie brings back the 'gunfighter' or the 'Dirty Harry' mystique that characterized him in the first two films. He's unpredictable, a loose cannon, and gutsy to the point of stupidity. Good thing he's sort of immortal!<br/><br/>Never mind the side characters in this film. They are only important as a challenge to Wolverine and to force him to scrap and claw his way through adversity. Wolverine takes his hits just like many of the best gunfighters and hard boiled detectives, think Clint Eastwood, in his reluctant path to unleash his darker side.<br/><br/>""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009) far surpasses the controversial third movie and it makes Wolverine much more interesting. In the first two movies I saw him as a side show, a weaker mutant, and a distraction from the imaginative powers of Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier. I used to think: why concentrate on this Wolverine guy so much?<br/><br/>But when he's the official main character and when he's allowed to portray a full spectrum of his loner and outsider self -- and his punishment taking and punishment dealing hotheadedness -- then he turns the movie into a story of a mysterious 'dark knight'.<br/><br/>His job is to clean the world of pure filth and to keep peace for us the sheep. It takes someone who is a bit dangerous himself, as symbolized by his dark dreams and tendency to claw his girlfriend accidentally in his sleep.<br/><br/>But, like ""Shane"", he appropriately goes back to being an outsider after he accomplishes his mission to wait for another time when he's needed and to preserve his independence -- always torturing himself so he can torture others when he must.<br/><br/>The plot pits Logan against the devious plans of Stryker (a human) and a team of mutants of Stryker. Stryker secretly begins to hunt down dangerous mutants and recruits Logan/Wolverine, but Wolverine shows moderation and reluctance to engage in Stryker's cruel missions.<br/><br/>Victor Creed, Wolverine's war friend and brother, then goes vigilante and starts hunting down the old team of mutants. Wolverine and Victor clash in some very fierce fighting; certainly the most brutal of any fight scenes in the X-Men movies so far.<br/><br/>Some of the straight forward mutants include a powerful and thick skinned blockhead (Fred Dukes / Blob), a charmer and hypnosis mind controller (Wolverine's girlfriend), a diamond skinned girl (her sister), an electricity controller (Chris Bradley / Bolt), a cyclops, a toad, and an ultimate mutant-monster (with combined mutant powers).<br/><br/>In this movie Logan/Wolverine takes tremendous amounts of pain; he takes the harshest sufferings and beatings of any gunfighter in any western ever made, but, of course, he's able to take it all through his near-immortalizing ability to heal.<br/><br/>But we also get a glimpse into another of Wolverine's vulnerabilities. X2 found a way to kill a mutant like him. Well, 'Origins' also finds a way.<br/><br/>Some of the time I was lost about the skills and characteristics of the other mutants. I wasn't quite sure about Agent Zero or Gamble. Their powers, their background, their everything was quite mysterious to me. I think Agent Zero is really fast like the Flash, but I wasn't sure. Gamble may have been too, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure about Victor Creed either; he reminded me of Sabretooth from the first movie (it wasn't explained if he was though). He has immense strength and agility, and he has great immunity to most injuries. He seems to have long life since he fought by the side of Logan in several wars. Why is Victor so powerful? Is he immortal like Wolverine or is his Achilles-heal just difficult to discover?<br/><br/>But I suppose such explanation of mutant powers and histories would require tangential scenes, voice over, or a reduction in the number of mutants.<br/><br/>I think the fewer the mutants the better. The stronger mutants would take attention away from Wolverine and make him seem less powerful in such a central role. He would be a man of mere lucky success, rather than a hero of strength, ingenuity, and experience. Perhaps he's a little too lucky in the final fight scenes, and it made me think that a more powerful mutant would make a better lead.<br/><br/>It wasn't as imaginative and cerebral as X2, but its dark ethos created more thrilling and interesting action than the action scenes in X-Men and X2. It's intense action and limited use of side mutants had the side effect of clearing the way for Wolverine, placing him center stage and portraying him with a new gunfighter ethos.<br/><br/>I got a little bored with some of the action and the lack of explanation to feed my imagination. Though after watching the special feature I was pleased that the filmmakers wanted the authentic Wolverine back. Hugh Jackman wanted to portray his fiercest self yet, and I think he succeeds."
"HelloFrancis","Null","2","4","16 September 2009"," Missed the Mark... Big Time.
","It's just a shame that the most famous Marvel character was treated this way in Xmen Origins: Wolverine. The cast did a good job and the visuals seemed to be in line with the other Xmen movies of this series, but I hate to say it, the directing was just not that good. The over-stylized use of Wolverine cutting things was obviously abused and every time he extended his claws he ""posed"" which really hurt me being able to emotionally connect with his character. It was the equivalent of seeing the outline of earlier green screen special effects in films in the 80s and 90s. Also, the story (not Gavin's fault) ended up in a really bad place; far from the actual history of Deadpool. I get it, creative license, and that's fine to a degree (like making Juggernaut a ""mutant"" in Xmen: The Last Stand when he's actually not one), but Deadpool's finishing end character seemed like it was ripped from the television show ""Heroes"" and stolen from the character ""Sylar"". C'mon Marvel!! You don't need to pull from that storyline, because you're... well... MARVEL!!! You've got an infinite supply of good story lines and the histories of your characters are solid. They had to be in order to sell enough books to the point where you are making movies about them. Lastly, I wasn't able to really emotionally connect to the entire storyline and the characters. Maybe the acting was a bit off, maybe the story didn't help, but in the end THAT comes down to the director and his ability to pull some really good content out of his actors. Example: George Lucas screwed up Star Wars Episodes 1, 2 and 3 because he didn't allow the actors to ""act"" and perform their craft. Instead he tried to make them EXACTLY like the original three films (4, 5 and 6) and it turned out very poorly. The same thing started happening here. Bryan Singer started something great and introduced a new style of time to this comic book/graphic novel genre of films, then Brett Ratner took it further and more emotionally deeper, then Gavin Hood tried to copy that. Gavin might have a career in directing, but I don't think he should take on such a big project again until he gets more experience directing under his belt. On the flip side, the studios shouldn't take on a newb when filming a movie of this magnitude and shell out the bucks for some very experienced talent. Better luck next time Gavin and FOX. Maybe Disney's acquisition will be a good thing... we'll see."
"departed07","8","2","4","15 September 2009"," For an origin movie, it's pretty cool.
","After three X-Men installments featuring the popular Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman, Marvel Studios decided to give the raging animal a movie of his own on how the character came to be.<br/><br/>Jackman plays the title character for the fourth time in the franchise as we witness the birth of Logan having claws at a young age along with his brother Victor Creed (a.k.a. Sabertooth), who has the same gift, and go through many wars where Victor enjoys the carnage of killing.<br/><br/>Logan and Victor are picked up by Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) in a special team for covert operations involving killing people; however Logan wants out and tries to lead a different life before many of his team members are killed off left and right like flies including those who are not like him. So now it's a race against time for Logan (Wolverine) to look for other mutants before they fall upon to Stryker's trap.<br/><br/>Overall, for an origin, it's a cool movie. This is really the type of film where many fans already know how Wolverine came to life from the first films and the comics, but the action scenes will get to you since they're bad-ass. Hugh Jackman still kicks ass as Wolverine and brings the animal rage just like the three installments. Liev Schriber (Scream 2) is the breakout actor as Sabertooth and brings a certain fear and terror to give many fans chills. Look for other characters as Wade Wilson, Gambit, Cyclops, The Blob and many more.<br/><br/>So, go enjoy X-Men Origins: Wolverine."

","The first five minutes of ""WOLVERINE"" gave me some hope that this might be a cut above other action garbage out there. That hope was gone after 20 minutes.<br/><br/>To give credit where credit is due, there are a few pretty good action sequences, particularly the fight scenes between Wolverine and Victor Creed (Liev Shreiber surprisingly gives a great performance in this). The scene where Wolverine and Creed team up against Mutant X1 on top of the nuclear power plant was well done also. Another good scene was when the elderly couple helping Logan are killed in the barn.<br/><br/>The bad is everything else, like the whole unbelievable plot of the romance with his girlfriend Kayla. And especially bad was how the movie just descends into mindless explosions. The ending was terrible and pointless when Wolverine gets amnesia after the battle.

This film was even better. I found Hugh Jackman to give his best performance ever as he commands the screen as an action hero. The whole story, especially the Silver Fox twist, was great. The film also has emotional scenes that may not match the intensity of the action sequences but still are pretty strong. 9/10 Very Very Good.<br/><br/>It is a special, special treat when the sequel to an excellent film franchise surpasses the former trilogy.

I loved the slick action, very cool and had a ""Wanted"" feeling. It had me wanting more and more scenes of it. No special plot but still average and that is enough because the action covered for it.<br/><br/>Isn't it always nice to have a explosive fun start, that gives you a slight tip of the ice cream to let you know what you should expect for the rest of the movie. Wolverine did just that, it surely kicked off very well. A nice simple fast first few minutes that had me buzzing. Very well done there. And it did just that, it's cool action packed begging remained for the rest of the film. It's not much more to say. The acting was brilliant, Hugh Jackman was excellent along with the rest of the cast. The plot was slanging, but it doesn't matter. A complete different type of ""X-men"" and better then the others. It's more fun this time around just focusing on Wolverine. It takes you back from the original X-men. All in all a fun action adventure, mediocre script, plain simple plot but furious cool action.

The beginning is a bit drama-ish, but it just gets better as it goes on. The action is fast, and the graphics and animation is quite-close-to-real types. The cinematography is brilliant, hand-in-hand with the editing. The flow of the movie is smooth, courtesy the direction. Sound effects - good, performances were OK, nothing great. X-Men is one of those movies that really aren't the ""can't miss it ones"" but definitely the ""must see"" types.<br/><br/>I only gave it a 7/10 because it's not as good as X-Men 1, or 2.

Adamantium in the bones, experiments done on him, lost memory... One thing bugged me though. In the end of Origins: Wolverine, Cyclops met Logan ( or at least he saw him when Logan was rescuing the mutants ), but in the first X-Men movie he doesn't appear to recognize him. It is understandable for Logan not to recognize Cyclops, because of all "" bullet in the head "" thing, but Cyclops should have known Logan. The special effects were above average and I liked the fact that Wolverine had a mutant brother with similar abilities. The mutant in the end was a bit too much and it was weird that Logan could defeat him, but I guess we all saw that coming. Oh yeah, why did Stryker stop walking at the end of the movie? The woman mutant told him not to stop. What the hell ?? All in all, it was 107 minutes well spent."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a triumphant follow-up to the third movie, The Last Stand where a lot of mutants were chucked in that they looked humans. It's a Gavin Hood film of characters, with characters. Because really, who can take another James Marsden?<br/><br/>Wolverine is apparently about Logan's history, and if I say history, it's literal. Little Logan (beforehand named Jimmy, no wonder he later changed it) and little Victor, brothers gifted with exoskeletons, enhanced senses, and regeneration live an average 1845 Canadian life. Only having been disowned after a family massacre, they trek the wages of war. The opening credits feature them all grown-up raiding the costume department as mercenaries. They are conveyed as brothers, and the director shows their tightness without even trying.<br/><br/>The director does his job in this one. He takes our eyeballs directly where the action starts. He pans the camera from the air and swiftly plummets it to the ground. Snips of the floor are blown but I want more.<br/><br/>The only thing funny in this movie is the casting: when I read Will.I.Am., Daniel Henny and ""And Ryan Reynolds"" in the beginning, I choke my chips. Reynolds is every teen guy's idol, of course but the ""And"" preceding His VandWilderness does not meet the expectations for his appearance. Taylor Kitsch (who plays Gambit) is profoundly the next big character next to Schreiber as he suavely plays his deck.

","After the unmitigated dross of the last X-Men movie I so badly wanted this to be good . It is, and some, and has restored the faith of a comic book geek. <br/><br/>The audience reaction (gauged on the way out of the cinema) was overwhelmingly positive. I have taken on an evangelical fervour in urging my family and friends to see it. When the negative reviews started appearing I was truly gob smacked ! The pretentious nature of most of them had me reaching for the sick bucket. They drone on and on that the first two movies ( which by the way I loved ) addressed meaningful issues such as social alienation and ostracism... yawn yawn which Wolverine lacked. So what? It is still a bloody good and entertaining film !!! Get over yourselves !!"

","I didn't expect this movie to be great, I thought it would just be average but this movie turned out to be excellent. This is a very well made and exciting film.<br/><br/>Because I have never watched a X-Men movie before, I found this a bit hard to follow. Other than that the movie was brilliant. The action scenes were spectacular and very exciting (some of the best I have seen in a while).<br/><br/>The special effects were great and were used very well. The movie was filmed very well and didn't make it uncomfortable to watch (like some movies). <br/><br/>To sum it up: I think this is a great movie which is exciting, well made and enjoyable to watch.

","I was kinda afraid after reading some critics and comments from people who downloaded illegally the workprint version all over the net. But when I saw this movie, i was really entertained. It's fun, quick and full of super-heroes.<br/><br/>For thoses who like the X-Men series, you will like this as well, i'm not a geek in comic books but I can tell you I read many X-Men, Wolverine, Batman and more, and it follows the original comics quite well. Sure, it could have been more, but from what we have, the result is quite satisfying. I didn't feel robbed as Hugh Jackman as well as the criminally underrated Liev Schreiber put on strong performances. We truly believe they are that super-human. A lot of effort and great storyline make this movie truly entertaining.<br/><br/>I highly suggest to thoses who have an open mind... sure it's not Watchmen or Iron Man but it's not Spider-Man (overrated) or Catwoman in terms of bad movies, it's truly in the greatest of our times, and even if I will have like to have at least 20-30 minutes more of this story, i am satisfied, it's not easy to make such a great film and the result is quite good, so I can tell people, to go watch this movie, a great visual treat !"

","What a lacklustre unimaginative stupid pile of junk movie, the stupidest origin story & use of Wolverine, Sabertooth & deadpool ever, with Wolverine displaying none of his unique abilitys apart from his claws & sabertooth prancing around like a dog looking absolutely ridiculous & the worst depiction of Deadpool possible.
As if all that idiocy wasn't enough they add the pointless appearance of Gambit, a young Cyclops & Emma frost & a bunch of random mutants along with an overly effeminate looking proffesor X with a full face of make up by Ru Paul.
There are not enough expletives to describe this pile of stinking BS, Benioff & Woods should have had the good sense to read a few x-men comics to at least get an idea of who these characters are & what they are capable of.
As a Wolverine movie this sucks big time, as a standalone action movie its weak, boring & unimaginative, stupid set action pieces & zero character development & with a plot & storyline worse than any cheap comic book.

"dilipbts","8","0","0","10 June 2020"," X-men origins Wolverine
","This is the origins story of the mutant known as Wolverine and how he was attached to the weapon x project.<br/><br/>When I first heard they were going to make this flick, I thought that the series was going to go into a nosedive. The third film in the X-men franchise lacked everything that made the first two films enjoyable. Now a spin-off? I wasn't having it and the fact that they seemed to ruin one of my favourite x-men characters in the trailers didn't seem to help either. Well, I can say this, the film is not that bad. It's actually decent and a step up from the horrid Last Stand. Although they do miss a few steps that really hurt the film as a whole.<br/><br/>First off Hugh Jackman was born to play this character, here he is given more room to dive deeper into the animal and he does a great job. Mixing both comedic and dramatic elements, there is nothing new here to the character, just more of the same. More of the same though is fun and kick ass. Liev Schreiber plays Victor Creed, aka Sabretooth. His look is different from the first time we see him and he actually has some speaking lines here. Excellent casting choice, Liev really lets go here and you can see the fun he is having with the character.<br/><br/>Now, onto the two things that are ruined, from a ""fan"" perspective. Deadpool and Gambit. Many fans knew going in that these two guys were both kick ass and that the film was not going to do them justice. Well, it's true. These two guys lacked the screen time and the badass personas that people have come to love. Ryan Reynold has 5 minutes of screen time, he does he usual jokey bits like in Blade Trinity, but here it fits for the character. We see one scene in which he uses his blades to deflect bullets, quite cool. Then he is gone for the rest of the film. Gambit shows up 3/4 of the way through and is horribly underused. Why is he in here again? His scenes lacked a lot of punch it seems that his character was only used to draw in fans. The character in the film could have been anybody else and it wouldn't effect the story, but they chose Gambit cause fans wanted to see him. You will be disappointed.<br/><br/>The final fight sequences is interesting, I don't want to go into details cause that would give away certain plot points, specifically who the final fight scene is with and why he is fighting him. I have to raise another complaint though, as for the explanation for Wolverine's so called memory loss. They don't explain it very well in the film, they just say that this will make him not remember. Why? I don't know. Fighting fire with fire just doesn't make sense to me. The explanation for his memory loss is truly pathetic and doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>There are cameos from a lot of mutants, cyclops as a kid is one and another one at the end that fans will enjoy. I thought that they could have trimmed the running time down a bit, currently 1hr46min. Subplots don't really work in this film, I'm talking about his love interest. A lazy way to try and drive the plot forward.<br/><br/>The action sequences range from enjoyable to laughable. The opening credit sequences is neat and mirrors what Watchmen did.Fans will most likely be disappointed by the lack of respect this ""origin"" story deserved. It's leaps and bounds over the last film, but that's not really saying much. The special effects are the worst in the entire series, which is a huge let knock against it because it's almost ten years after the original."

","YOUR PAST CAN BE REDEMPTIVE.<br/><br/>A trailer that inspires a viewer to cinematic admiration through a story that shows not only where wolverine and some other characters have come from, but also how they got there.<br/><br/>With this in mind, it can make one think how we are all called to me different and give the Misfists of the world an exemplar to walk with in the shoes of a character that relates with them the most. In fact, Pastor Chris Durso defines ""a misfit as someone who is uncomfortable with their surroundings and someone who is disturbingly different than others with the norms of culture."" As this movie will inspire you to be a peculiar in the real world.<br/><br/>This trailer is imaginative and entertainingly engaging with shocking visual design, cinematography, and special visual effects that makes you feel like you're apart of the action.<br/><br/>The trailer showcases performances that are vibrant, full of confidence, style and flair. Hugh Jackman and Lynn Collins were both phenomenal; truthful in the moment and emotionally connected, as they fully transformed into their characters. Not to mention the other characters were believable as they showed hard work, technique, good direction, and loyalty to the original characters of the comic book. Putting on display
A wide variety of character strengths behind the characters. Like courage, justice, wisdom, knowledge, humanity, temperance, and transcendence - being that it's a superhero flick.<br/><br/>In effect, the trailer pulls you in and brings you into the world of Wolverine as you travel through snippets of his backstory of Wolverine. Who is ""seeking solace from his dark past, Logan, better known as Wolverine, seems to have found love and contentment with Kayla Silverfox. Logan's peaceful existence is shattered when Victor Creed, his vicious brother, brutally murders Kayla. Logan's thirst for revenge propels him into the Weapon X program, where he undergoes a painful procedure to bond his bones with adamantium, making him virtually indestructible and more than a match for Victor"" (ref. Google).<br/><br/>Although special effects can be striking and really enhance the movie, it made the appearance commercially attractive, more distinctive and memorable.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the production quality was very impressive throughout; both visually and through the amusing sound effects as it made the production more creative in using less as more.<br/><br/>Overall, the trailer is a blast from the past of Wolverine and the other legendary characters that gives your a well anticipated drive to want to see the move to experience their story from the screen."
"friendkj","7","0","0","23 January 2020"," An Origins story that could have been perfect
","Wolverine, with out a doubt, is a badass. He was also very popular. Popular enough to get his own solo film in 2009. There would be a further 2 more solo Wolverine films in 2013 and 2017. When X-Men Origins: Wolverine was released, it was not recieved well by critcs at all. Up until Dark Phoenix, it was considered to be the worst X-Men film. Is it as bad as the critics say? No, not at all. X-Men Origins: Wolverine manages to be a good film but fails at being the perfect origins story for an amazing character. The film follows Logan aka Wolverine's love is killed by his brother. Logan decides to seek revenge and then becomes a ,mutant. As far as to the origins of Wolverine, there is not a whole lot. What was described in the movie could easily have been used in the earlier films. Personally, the more I think about it, I don't think an origins film was really necessary for a character like Wolverine. Maybe I need some sort of knowledge of the comics to understand the things that occured in this film, but should I honestly have to? A comic-book film should strive to appeal to a bigger crowd than just the typical comic book readers. The action was good and all that stuff. The acting was not too bad. The dialogue was OK. This film just has terrible writing and it just ends up being forgettable. Not at all bad. Just not a fantastic film."

I knew about the bathroom scene, but the fat guy boxing, the terrible cg in all the fights, Gambit's non-character and that last fight with Wade were just unbelievably BAD. How would a studio green light such a poorly made movie? Awful plot apart, it was the terrible editing, directorial choices and horrendous special effects that made this thing even worse than my already low expectations.
Hugg Jackman was excellent tho with what he was given, and going in knowing what i'm in for made the experience bareable and maybe a bit fun.

","""Wolverine"" is a standard Marvel's blockbuster. Expensive, great effects and production, visually impressive and full of fast-paced action that is trying to divert your attention from an expectedly lousy scenario. Logan and Victor have good characterization and Hugh Jackman and especially Liev Schreiber are excellent in their roles, but the rest of the characters are just packed to fill the space. Characterization and motivation of other characters are nonexistent and they leave no impression, and the story is interesting but very poorly developed. I love the origins stories and I hate when their potential remains so unutilized. This was the third time I've been watching this movie, and while I watched it, I had the impression that I was watching it for the first time. It is so forgettable that nothing has left in my memory from the previous viewing. It probably deserves one or two grades lower, but I have to treat it as it is quite entertaining.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I just finished watching The first three XMen movies and followed with Wolverine.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about this movie. They got Victor Creed so right. I much prefer this character portrayal than the one written for the original XMen movie. 
Hugh Jackman is also great in this - I don't think he's ever been bad as the character, he's just improved since the first movie. 
The story was great. Lots of great characters involved that we hadn't seen up to this point. <br/><br/>What they got wrong was Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool). Ryan Reynolds did a great job, it's just the portrayal was written so wrong. 
But, with the events of XMen: Days Of Future Past, this version of Deadpool can still stand in the old/original timeline. Anyway, glad they did a better version of Wade/Deadpool later. 
Also some of the CGI in this is a little hard to swallow. Logan's claws are drawn on way too much - especially for close up shots. They look like cartoons over live action (like Roger Rabbit). <br/><br/>So I liked the story and the movie as a whole but, it did seem to be edited strangely. Like a minute or 2 of some scenes were missing. <br/><br/>If you're an XMen fan then you will like this but, also be disappointed by some of the places they dropped the ball a little. 
Otherwise it is still a decent action sci-fi movie. 
It's probably the weakest of the XMen movies but still worth the watch."

"alex_howells92","6","0","0","8 June 2016"," Good Action. Bad Script.
","Seeing as 2008 was roughly the start of The Superhero genre gaining popularity and considering this film came out just after 'The Dark Knight' and Iron Man' and its the first prequel to a successful franchise, it already had high expectations for such a well known character as Wolverine, and with a back story looking into how he was given his Adamantium skeleton but ultimately falls flat. I found this film has the same problem as Xmen 3 were a lot of the films works on more visual effects than building on the characters and working on their development.<br/><br/>Obviously Hugh Jackman is always great as Wolverine, he is so dedicated to the role and has really shown that he is passionate about the character but no matter how good an actor is, you cant get around a badly written script. There is to much going on at once to really connect with any character. There's Logans love story with Silverfox, William Strykers team of mutants and there whereabouts, a rogue Sabretooth on the hunt for mutants and a young Cyclops dealing with his powers in high school. With all these things going on its hard to really get into any of the other story lines as it all feels very disconnected.<br/><br/>A problem i found with this film is that even though it follows the story of Wolverine in the Weapon X program, it involves way to many mutants and as much as i love cameos and references and even seeing other mutants and their powers, i feel way to many were crammed into this film, some of the more visually mutant powers like Gambits and Wraiths were good looking on screen but i felt there were a lot of mutants that seemed boring like Bolt, Agent Zero and the Blob. Another problem i found was since Sabretooth was already an established character, they made no attempt to even make Liev Schriber look like how Tyler Mane from the original does. obviously the biggest problem with any of the mutants in this film is Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds was brilliant as Wade Wilson from the at the beginning with the smart- ass attitude and cocky remarks but as the film goes on and they show you 'The Pool' towards the end its really is a mess. The character known as the 'Merc with a mouth' has his lips sown shut and is reduced to a brainwashed henchman for Stryker. <br/><br/>Another problem i found with this film is that its kinda hard to worry about a nearly indestructible protagonist when none of his enemies are as strong as him, plus iv always felt that its hard to make prequels tense because your fully aware Wolverine, Sabretooth, Cyclops and Stryker cant die because they all show up in the original trilogy but i guess that's something that you have to deal with with prequels. <br/><br/>Overall 'Wolverine Origins' definitely isn't a brilliant Superhero film but visually its not a bad film, Its not one of the defining Xmen films but it has its moments of entertaining action scenes. Worth a watch if your a fan of Superhero films, Xmen or Hugh Jackman."

A lot more. The story was boring as hell for starters. The characters and the way they portrayed them seemed to feel dry -- the love story was extremely boring -- not to mention the amount of build up to typical action scenes. Just wasn't worth it.<br/><br/>Some action scenes did feel exciting to watch, and the effects were not bad for 2009.

At this point the movie is still a fine piece of action a little light on characters (aside from Wolverine and Sabertooth).

From what I've learned after seeing the movie is that the story of Wolverine was changed a few years ago, to give him claws as part of his original mutant powers...and I really disagree with that storyline...however...I was willing to let that slide...as it is a comic book movie, and directors and writers have the really hard job of deciding what elements from the multiple story lines to use and to disregard...<br/><br/>having said that...I would have been fine with Bone Claws...had the rest of the film been worthwhile, but all we seem to get is, wolverine looking angry...someone dying...wolverine looking angry someone dying and so on...then comes Stryker...probably one of the worst casting mistakes ever, why was Brian Cox not in this? plus the laughable line ""I'll make you indestructible"" then after doing so, and Wolverine escaping ""hunt him down...and take off his head"" WTF? you just made him indestructible...how in the hell is anyone going to take his head off? it's not like anyone made an admanatium samurai sword...oh wait...you did make an adamantium amnesia bullet...<br/><br/>then there is Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds is a breath of fresh air for the tiny amount time that he's on screen, even when his mouth is melded shut...and as many people before me have said...he ends up looking like Baraka from Mortal Kombat towards the end...<br/><br/>and I don't even think I can say anything about Gambit without completely going off subject...just what in the hell is going on in this film? I know it it's meant to be a Wolverine origin...but it seems to be more about Sabretooth than anything else, and he hasn't been handled that greatly either...I'm not even sure if this can be called a review...as I'm not even sure if it makes any sense...I'm just typing away here letting my thoughts spill out on to the screen...sorry if I've wasted your time...but I just had to post my thoughts here."

","The movie was great. Like every comic movie, it isn't 100% correct, but they made it simple and had the parts that matter in it. The fight are very nice as well. There is a lot of action and love and the ending is not what you would expect. You should see this movie if you get a chance. There was a lot of laughing going on and the people watching the movie all seemed pleased. There are some very hardcore comic fans that may try to nit pick, but if you are just going for a good movie to watch, that just so happens to have a cool X-men as the star, this is the movie for you!<br/><br/>I would also like to add that the bad guys pull off some pretty cool tricks."
"UmmaKynes","2","3","8","16 May 2009"," Terrible
","This movie lacks a story line that makes sense or character development for anyone (except barely for Wolverine). Just like X-Men 3, it introduces too many characters, and even the semi-major characters don't have any background development. You better be a fanboy to know anything about, or care about, these characters. I went into this movie expecting only action, and even that didn't impress. Seriously, having Dead Pool been the final boss battle after seeing less than 10 minutes of this character before? Giving him EVERYBODY's super powers? If anything in this movie actually made sense, it would be swamped by the film's complete absurdity."
"The_Orenda","4","3","8","11 May 2009"," Jackman and Schreiber the lone highlights.
","I've always been a fan of Schreiber, and Jackman has survived well enough to earn my respect. With that said, well, Wolverine isn't bad but hardly great either. Clues throughout the film tip the plot grudgingly forward as actors say some of the worst lines that anyone can get paid to say, and if the action strays from Hugh, the film is a shameless bore. Hugh knows Wolverine and captures the best of the hero's moments despite the shortcomings of all the other characters we could hope would live up to, such as Blob or Gambit. If you have the best surround system at home with the best TV, Wolverine would be perfect for a home viewing, where any cheesiness that oozes out of the screen, can be handled with a beer, or two.... or three."

","Like its titular hero, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" goes by through its rote proceedings with such single-mindedness in removing any hint of mystery in a comic book character whose enigma is one of his selling points. Which is not to say that the first prospective summer blockbuster this year is the worst Marvel Comics-based film there is but, while sporadically diverting, it's a tepid and shallow rendition of the mutant team's most famous member.<br/><br/>In a quick intro during the opening credit sequence, Wolverine a.k.a. James Howlett (Hugh Jackman) and half-brother Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) are seen fighting together at the American Civil War, the two World Wars, and the Vietnam War, where after Victor kills a superior officer, the two are sentenced to death through firing squad but due to their superhuman healing ability, the two are simply locked behind bars. This, however, gets the attention of William Stryker and recruits the two to Team X, a special ops team of mutants assembled to kill other mutants. Their latest killing spree in Nigeria, however, racks James' conscience and forces him to leave the team and take on a new life as a logger in the Canadian Rockies under the new alias Logan, and with new girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). But when Victor kills Kayla and Stryker has an offer too hard to resist, Logan sets out to become Wolverine and sets his sights on killing Victor.<br/><br/>From here, Gavin Hood's (""Tsotsi"", ""Rendition"") comic book saga pretty much becomes a frustratingly one-trick origin story, predicated to repetitive - albeit stylish - action setpieces and obsessed with flaunting Jackman's naked body and metal claws, yet neither racking up significant impetus nor a sense of grandeur throughout the episodic script by ""The Kite Runner"" scribe David Benioff. While all made mildly engaging by Jackman, Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, and Will.i.am, and the much-awaited feature film debut of Gambit (disappointingly brief as his appearance may be), ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" remains a predestined narrative, an inherent prequel problem that would have been fine had the means was as fetching as the ends."

"laraemeadows","4","3","9","1 May 2009"," Shoddy Production and Smoking Hotness
","Forged in the heat of war and personal tragedy, claw wielding Wolverine was born. Shoddy production and inconsistent writing makes me wish that X-Men Origins: Wolverine could be retroactively aborted.<br/><br/>After his life is turned upside down, the young James Logan - Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) embarks on a tragic journey with co-mutant Victor Creed (Live Schreiber) that spans four wars and endless killing. When the wars finally end, they are dispatched to be members of a special squad of men sent to commit unspeakable acts. Unable to stomach the discomfort of his orders, Logan splits to find newer, more unimaginable pain. All the while Hugh Jackman is hot.<br/><br/>It surprises me that a movie with such a large budget and characters with a following as strong as the X-Men comics could not find a company to produce quality visuals. (Good thing Hugh Jackman didn't need help with his high quality visuals.) The computer generated effects are more than 20% of the movie, and are 80% of the problem. Lighting on the actors is a different color and are at a different angle than the green screen scenery behind. The generated backdrops lack an understanding of shadow and depth of field. This basic misunderstanding of lighting irons the visuals so flat, it's impossible to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>The frustration is further compounded by the unnecessary use of generated objects. (And the unnecessary use of clothing on Jackman.) Instead of using models to create locations too expensive to build fully, they are created using the same disappointing generations. When props could be used to save money on the film and create a better visual effect, director Gavin Hood still uses artificially spawned effects.<br/><br/>The writing by David Benioff and Skip Woods does not come naturally either. Events that could prove Wolverine's humanity are sped through at a pace that makes them almost comedy. The love story is so rushed, it is hard to feel their connection. Characters multiply so quickly, it is hard to keep them straight. (Except Wolverine, it is hard to miss Jackman when he is burning a hole in the screen.) Some of the one liners are as clich√© as teenage angst.<br/><br/>The audience is forced to languish in poorly lit fight scenes that drag on in near complete darkness. Those scenes that had enough light were poorly choreographed, and it is hard to get interested in what they are doing. Well, when they have their clothes on.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine has an almost orgasmic amount of pretty. I admit it shamelessly: I am in complete and total lust with Hugh Jackman, and his special attention to his body for this movie did not go unnoticed, by me or any of the other people in the theater. Jackman wasn't alone in unbelievably, moist-worthy hotness. Live Schreiber's creepy character can't outshine his ha-cha-cha-cha gorgeousness. Lynn Collin, who plays Kayla ‚Äì the love interest in the film, made me want to fall in love with her.<br/><br/>These actors did not just rest on their beauty. Hugh Jackman was completely handcuffed by an imprisoning script. Jackman and Collins have really beautiful chemistry. My only gripe about the acting was the complete lack of emotional connection between Jackman and Schreiber. Neither gave bad performances individually but they can't seem to really bond the characters tight enough to make enough to give the story the depth.<br/><br/>All I wanted from X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a bit of ass kicking fun. Even accounting for the Yowza Factor, X-Men Origins: Wolverine fell short. The substandard visuals made even the best looking people (Hugh Jackman) look stupid."

","If your a fan of the comics you will be sadly disappointed in this movie. It seems every character in some way had their real stories butchered to a pulp. They spent more time trying to cram as many mutants into one film to bring a larger audience/make more $, that when they had to tie it all together it just flat out failed. But by that point you've already bought your ticket and fallen into their trap. From a movie perspective, the effects were TRASH, a lot of the dialog was cheesy one liners, and WAY too much story to cram into 1:36 length that I felt everything was being rushed. I had hoped Wolverine Origins would redeem the franchise after X3 butchered it, but sadly I was mistaken."
"xamtaro","6","2","5","19 September 2009"," A feral heartless beast clawing frantically at its enemies and searching in vain for something missing...
","No, by my summary/title i am not describing the character of Wolverine but the very movie itself. It is action packed, it is fun to watch but it is also a huge disappointment if you are expecting an honest to goodness ""origin"" story.<br/><br/>I could not quite put my finger on what was wrong the first time i watched this, but now with the DVD i can re-watch it as many time i like. First off, for a movie entitled ""X-men origins: Wolverine"" one would expect a more character centered narrative that delves deep into the core of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character; his motives, his personality etc. What we are given instead is a generic action movie with the whole ""origin"" bit as merely a backdrop for introducing more ""cool"" mutant characters.<br/><br/>That is the main flaw of this movie as a whole: giving in too much to the demands of the typical summer blockbuster audience and sidelining everything else. No doubt that people will be impressed with the many wanton destruction scenes and fast paced fights this movie delivers. Vehicles are blown up, buildings are demolished; heck even a school is practically blasted in two. There are so many moments of ""wow!"" that even the brain-dead can just sit back and enjoy. <br/><br/>Sadly the characters themselves, though played well by some very professional actors, are not enough to drive the movie. I am guessing that we are supposed to see the tragic side of this hero's past that drove him toward his decision to graft adamantium to his bones. However, the character interactions are not strong enough for the audience to have much of an emotional connection to any of the characters. Wolverine's falling out with his brother, the death of his love interest, the betrayals etc, they never really convey much of an emotional impact. Instead they come across very ""matter-of-fact-ly""; those events just happened so that the plot could advance. Even Wolverine's portrayal of a cool kick-butt hero with a sarcastic sense of humor may incite a giggle or two with his crass jokes but anyone looking for a deeper emotional understanding of the character, look elsewhere.(this flaw i blame more on the script as the actors themselves are quite good)<br/><br/>Once you look past all the visual effects and this whole grand scale epic journey, there really isn't much ""heart"" in this movie. Comic book fans would no doubt cry bloody murder at the liberties this movie takes with Wolverine's comic book origins and fans of the Bryan Singer X-men movies would agree that there was more emotional character development for Wolverine in 1 hour of X-men2 than there was in the entire 107 minutes of this film. The only audience i can foresee enjoying this are the superficial adrenaline pumped teens looking for a quick action fix. Honestly i would not even have gotten the DVD had it not been for its relatively cheap price and its wide array of extras.<br/><br/>Like its titular character, X-men Origins: Wolverine is cool, funny, and pack to the gills with heart pumping action. It slices and dices its way from one grand special-effects laden battle to the next leaving behind a thin plot and a core without ""heart"". Emotionally disappointing as a tragic origin story, this movie is never really able to find the balance that made other superhero movies like Batman Begins and Iron Man such hits."
"tsassassin444","2","2","5","16 September 2009"," If you liked this from the start watch it again and you my be upset SPOILERS
","I'm upset. I was so jacked to see this and the first round I was pretty happy but I did have some fun laughing about it with my friends. After that, it got worse. <br/><br/>Good: The opening montage was really sweet. <br/><br/>Liev Shreiber rules. He was awesome in the first part with the killing and claws, but I was totally not feeling at the end when he save Wolverine. Wrong. ""We're brothers. Brothers stick together."" Not in X-men you don't. <br/><br/>And that's about it.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>Jesus<br/><br/>The CGI was miserable. The part when he was admiring the new claw in the mirror and the art where he is slicing the scaffolding, which makes no freaking sense, in particular. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is not a good wolverine. I liked him at first but why would an unkillable monster be afraid of flying? His little snarky lines and feathered hair infuriate me. Wolverine is supposed to growl everything he says and inject whiskey in to his eyes to keep in shape, not throw his hair back as he walks in slow motion. <br/><br/>The finally give Ryan Reynolds apart where he's allowed to be annoying and do pretty much exactly what Ryan Reynolds does in every flick he's in. Then they give him 3 lines then seal his mouth shut. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to seal his mouth shut, just not as Deadpool.<br/><br/>Aside from that, there's the stuff that doesn't make sense. <br/><br/>Why the hell was Gambit there? I know everyone wants to see him, but why? Wolverine convinces Gambit to fly him to the island so he can kill everyone that wronged him and by extension wronged Gambit. Then when Wolvie takes out the smoke stack Gambit inexplicably shows up and comments on how he thought Wolvie was kidding about killing everyone. WHO THE HELL DID HE KILL? He let Stryker and Sabretooth go! <br/><br/>Deadpool uses his swords to deflect bullets in the beginning. Then they give him adimantium swords the poke out of his forearms. How is that better than giving him swords again? And even more, the swords were like four feet long... how the hell did they fit into his arms?<br/><br/>Silver Fox tells Stryker after grabbing him to walk as far as he could until his feet bleed, then they show him in some field and his shoes are all destroyed, presumably from walking... they were on an island! How far could he have gotten and how the hell did he get into a field? <br/><br/>This was entertaining but I was totally removed after all the stupid crap. It's not a good X-men flick."
"ivan_nightwish","9","2","5","8 September 2009"," Another excellent Jackman performance...
","All in all, I liked this film. I see a lot of negative comments here, and many of those do have it's points. The plot has some holes, but not that big, and there is a lacking of action scenes, the kind of thrilling we saw in the previous three films.<br/><br/>Well, this is the story of Wolverine origins, and honestly, when I first heard that they were going to make this movie, this is what I expected. In the absence of other characters that made the first three parts great, this one didn't have that much chance.<br/><br/>The reason I'm giving this movie this high grade is because of Hugh Jackman. As I mentioned in the title, he did another excellent performance as Logan/Wolverine. He really infiltrated into the origins and did a very convincing job. I expected no less form him, after all he is a great actor.<br/><br/>If you liked the first three films of the series, you shouldn't miss this one. It's not what it could have been, but at least you'll find out some interesting facts about our main slasher, and also see some great CGI.<br/><br/>I was also surprised to see Ryan Reynolds in this movie. After Wan Wilder and Definitely, Maybe, I never expected to see him as a mutant... especially beside Jacman and Schreiber... well, he gave his usual performance - not too entertaining, not too dramatic.<br/><br/>I think we should give this film a break... because I think that that this film is... a big break between the third and the fourth installment. Let's wait for the next one, and than we'll judge the director... :-)"

The movie starts out with Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) as kids. They soon become Wolverine and Sabertooth. They were brothers as kids who will soon become enemies. The movie has surprisingly very little action. Even know people like Will i Am and Ryan Reynolds keep showing up as side superheroes and giving their piece of the action pie. The movie is overdosed with too much plot to bring us too little action. That said, the cast, especially Jackman and Schreiber do bring some fun, taking their piece in the action rotation.

"ozymandiaskingofkings","4","2","5","1 July 2009"," Boring, predictable, pointless.
","his was a film which something in my gut told me was going to be awful. I can't explain it. Call it what you will, instinct, a hunch, women's intuition, but I just wasn't looking forward to it. Maybe it's because I'm not a fan of prequels in general (seriously, name a good prequel. I dare you), maybe it's because I felt after Wolverine's origin was dealt with so well in ""X-Men 2"", or maybe it's just because Empire magazine had been building it up for months. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Empire fan, and find them generally reliable, but I wish they were occasionally less optimistic about upcoming films.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really wanted this to be good, but less that 30 minutes in I knew my fears were concerned. It feels muddled and redundant, telling us little we didn't already know about the character. It's a strange film in that it is almost completely brainless, yet has too many ideas going on. I'll try to clarify this: at the heart of the film is a very clich√©d and revenge storyline, while in the occasional back-stories there is really interesting stuff that isn't explored at all. In the first 20 minutes or so, we see Wolverine participating in three major wars, any one of which would have made an interesting subject. All are glossed over, when a film concentrating solely upon Wolverine in 'Nam, or WW2, could be potentially fascinating.<br/><br/>Then, in the only interesting part of the film, Wolverine and Sabertooth (who's apparently his brother?!?) join a special forces team made up of really cool mutants like Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds, stealing the whole damn movie even though he's only in it for about a minute), Agent 0 and, Er, will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas (no, I don't know what the hell they were thinking anyway). Again, there's a really interesting group dynamic here, and the film could have just focused on these guys, but its over with in a short scene.<br/><br/>Then its plodding nonsense with goodies (Wolverine, Gambit) and baddies (Stryker, Sabertooth), with slow motion walking-away-from-explosion shots, helicopters, and all the usual turgid action nonsense that looks like its wandered in from a Dolph Lungren film. The whole thing doesn't cohere at all, its a film where the writers have just gone: ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" made a list and got on with ticking stuff off. The scenes which should be emotional, like the death of Wolverine's wife, are handled poorly (including an unintentionally hilarious NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! moment) while a slow moment where Wolverine hides out on a farm with an elderly couple is just far too Norman Rockwell, like it's wandered in from a Superman film. Then the old couple get killed pointlessly just to make Wolverine angry again. It's all very cynical and exploitative on the part of the writers.<br/><br/>And these are just the beginning of the film's problems.<br/><br/>The main issue of the film, apart from the ever mounting number of visual and narrative clich√©s, is that it is inherently suspense-less. We know that Wolverine doesn't kill Sabretooth or Stryker because they're alive in the original series. We know that Wolverine is going to survive everything thrown at him for the same reason, and by putting the stress on his indestructible nature, we never really feel he is in peril. They're retreading the plot of X2, but nowhere near as well. At times, you wonder whether they've actually seen Singer's films, the whole thing seems so amateurish and poorly written (and indeeds, in the end scene completely ignores continuity). There isn't any of the depth or complexity of the proper films. Hell, this makes Brett Ratner's movie look like ""The Dark Knight""!!! And it isn't just that. The whole film is just box ticking of fan favourites that producers thought would sell tickets, and nobody is more than one dimensional. Deadpool walks away with his head held high, and I look forwards to the spin off movie with him, but Gambit is very poorly done and the others, like Emma Frost or Blob, are just cameos that add nothing to the film.<br/><br/>The acting isn't especially great either. Jackman plays Wolverine with none of the sarcastic fury of the Singer movies, Taylor Kitsch is rubbish as Gambit and Danny Hudson as Stryker is about as menacing as a poodle. Why they couldn't have got the fantastic Brian Cox back completely baffles me. Only Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth is any good, and even then he isn't really given enough to work with.<br/><br/>Badly written, Badly acted, Badly directed and an insult to both fans and audiences. The worst film I've seen so far this year."

","A decent Hollywood movie coming around after quite a long time! The marvel comics' fictional characters from the X-Men trilogy are already popular with movie and comic fans. Set as a prequel to the trilogy, the story is centered on the origin and the life of the mutant James Howlett/ Logan/ Wolverine and his skirmishes with his half-brother Victor Creed. With not a minute wasted, rest assured that this will be an interesting watch! <br/><br/>Beginning in 1845 Canada, young and sickly James Howlett witnesses his father being murdered by Thomas Logan who is later revealed as James' father. Fleeing home, young James and brother Victor, both wolf-like, indestructible and immortal mutants fight in the American Civil War, both World Wars and the Vietnam War. Their skills attract the attention of Major Stryker who recruits them into specially set up all-mutant Team X.<br/><br/>The team's mutant members include shooter Agent Zero, a mercenary, a teleporter, an invincible muscleman, a technopath among others. Tired of violence and inhuman acts meted out by the group, James leaves to retire into the quiet of the Canandan woods as a lumberjack. But, the violent past just doesn't end as Victor returns to finish off Team X; instead murders James Logan's lover, thus putting the latter on the path of revenge.<br/><br/>Stryker convinces James, now Logan to accept a bio-metallurgical reinforcement so that he can avenge his lover's death. The element is the virtually indestructible adamantium which now makes Logan, now Wolverine's bones and claws razor sharp and deadly. As the story unfolds, Stryker is also busy readying Weapon XI, a mutant-super-soldier that combines abilities of all other mutants being researched at the secret facility.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Wolverine holds the movie throughout and plays the part to perfection replete with the intensity we have been familiar with in the other X-Men movies. Liev Schreiber as the brother of the protagonist and interchangeably an adversary and ally plays his part menacingly well. Of course, there are other weird mutants designed to keep the make-up man busy on the set. Ben Kingsley's cameo is cherry on the cake.<br/><br/>Shot mostly in Australia and New Zealand, the movie locales chosen well and the special effects ensure that your interest is kept alive throughout. Although there are action sequences that beat logic by any stretch of imagination such as Agent Zero reloading his guns in mid-air and Gambit fighting off bullets with a sword, this is just passed off as creativity. Remember, the movie is both Sci-fi and Fantasy!"

X3 killed the current X-Men film franchise; Wolverine buried it.<br/><br/>To his credit, Hugh Jackman gives it his all and does a pretty good job, as do Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth and Danny Huston as Stryker. Beyond that, there is nothing to recommend this movie. Absolutely nothing happens, the script is terrible (and often just plain stupid), the ""action"" and stunts are nothing we haven't seen before, a lot of the effects are extremely crappy, and the characters are sorely mistreated. Seriously, now that we know Wolverine's origin, I couldn't give two sh**s about him. There is almost nothing about this movie that worked. It's generic, it's lame, it's complete and utter crap.<br/><br/>After this and X-Men 3, I am really hoping Marvel Studios fights to claim X-Men movie production rights from Fox.

","Most people know him as the most popular member of the X-men, the 'brand ambassador' of the franchise in a manner of speaking. But in many ways, Wolverine has surpassed the X-men to become an iconic legend in his own right. And after facilitating three cinematic outings for the ferocious mutant with adamantium claws along with his fellow teammates, 20th century Fox has now finally decided to give the character his own film and unveil to the wider world one of the most intriguing stories of all time: the true origins of Wolverine.<br/><br/>The story of the man who would become Wolverine begins on an estate in Canada in 1845, when James, the son of a wealthy landowner, witnesses the brutal murder of his father at the hand's of his groundskeeper Thomas Logan, and learns much to his horror, that Logan is his true father. Killing Logan in a fit of the berzeker rage that would later become his trademark, using his newly manifested bone claws, young James flees the estate with his half-brother, Victor. Over the next century and beyond, James (now assuming the name of his true father, Logan) and Victor lend their services to the US Army in the Civil War, the World Wars and the Vietnam War (all depicted in a spectacular opening sequence), using their mutant abilities to survive and ensure their longetivity. However, their special gifts have not been entirely overlooked for during Vietnam, they are both recruited by Major William Stryker for a special forces team consisting of mutants, including the superhumanly strong Fred Dukes, the expert marksman and gymnast Agent Zero, the teleporter John Wraith, the technopath Chris Bradly and the sword wielding 'perfect soldier', Wade Wilson. However, after realising that his teammates are willing to kill innocents indiscriminately and realising the extent of his brothers homicidal tendencies, Logan abandons the team.<br/><br/>Six years later, it seems that Logan has finally found peace in the arms of his lover, Kayla. But the shadows of his past return to haunt him when Kayla is seemingly killed by Victor, leading Logan to seek vengeance. Needing an edge over his nemesis, Logan rejoins Stryker and volunteers to undergo the adamantium bonding procedure and become 'Weapon X'. But on realising Strykers true agenda, Logan breaks lose and escapes, setting out to hunt down not only Victor, but Stryker as well.<br/><br/>The special effects and stunts are truly breath-taking, if somewhat stylized compared to previous entries in the franchise. Wolverine's battles with Sabertooth (Victor), Gambit and Deadpool are brilliant visual spectacles. The plot is pretty okay as well; its a bit rushed and quite a few liberties have been taking with the source material, but considering that the idea is to recapture the spirit of the character and considering that the said source material is 15-20 years worth of contradictory stories, they do a pretty good job. But the real cake goes to the performances. Hugh Jackman does a brilliant job as Wolverine, as always, though of course, this time he portrays aspects of the character never seen before on screen. The important thing to understand about Wolverine is that hes not a superhero; hes a wild, dangerous, anti-hero, a vengeful and unbalanced killing machine. And yet he has a soul, he has the ruins of a conscience, which is something Sabertooth clearly lacks, as evident by his shock and disgust on learning that Stryker is experimenting on innocent young mutants. Liev Schreiber plays Victor Creed/Sabertooth (though he isn't named as such in the film) as the animal that Logan/Wolverine doesn't become in spite of all he's been through. Danny Huston does a good job as William Stryker, the manipulative military scientist who seems to share an almost eerie father-son relationship with Logan. Lynn Collin does okay as Logan's one-time love Kayla and Taylor Kitcsh steals the stage from Jackman temporarily as the happy go lucky mutant gambler Remy LeBeau. Also notable is Tim Pocock for his role as a teenage Scott Summers, destined to become X-men leader Cyclops and Patrick Stewart (de-aged by CGI) as mutant visionary and X-men founder Charles Xavier in a small cameo role.<br/><br/>Overall, Wolverine is the perfect origin story and action film both rolled into one for one of comicdom's legendary figures."

","I have always loved watching movies that are based to a large extent on a fanciful theme. The X-Men comics are full of great imagination giving way to an absolutely gripping storyline for a two hour movie. Obviously the movies that are made on such comics are bound to do great. After the three X-Men sequels, everybody's favourite Wolverine is seen in full form in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I was quite excited to watch this movie because of three reasons. Firstly I love Hugh Jackman, secondly wolverine is my favourite mutant and thirdly Bollywood is sadly churning out clich√©d movies right now.<br/><br/>The movie is a prequel. It tells the story of how Wolverine becomes an indestructible mutant. It illustrates Logan's painful journey in becoming Wolverine. The movie opens during Wolverine's childhood, where we learn that he and Victor Creed (Sabretooth) are actually brothers. When their father is killed in front of them, Wolverine's mutant power emerges and he and Victor run away together. In Vietnam, they are recruited into a secret group of mutant soldiers who run missions for William Stryker. Logan eventually decides that he has had enough of the killing and quits, moving up to Canada to make a peaceful living as a lumberjack, but a few years later, Victor comes looking for him. Stryker offers to help by giving Logan the opportunity to participate in an experimental program that will infuse his skeleton with the indestructible metal, adamantium.<br/><br/>The action scenes between Sabretooth, played brilliantly well by Liev Schreiber, and Wolverine were power packed and breath-taking. Hugh Jackman has done complete justice to the role. I will say that Liev Schreiber turns in a great performance, and together with Hugh Jackman he anchors the film. The relationship and rivalry at the center of it all feels real at times. I don't think anybody else would play the roles of Sabretooth and Wolverine better than Leiv Schreiber and Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>The movie is super fantastic from the first scene till the end. It had me at the edge of my seat through the actions scenes and special effects. Thoroughly entertaining and was certainly value for money."

","This fourth film with (part of) the X-men is based around the past of Wolverine. There's no real need for further character introduction - the most important ones are defined already and the new ones are laid down quick enough to have a fitting place in the film. Action films like this are usually full of eye candy and this one isn't much different - there's more than enough to look at. There is also some sort of backing story, even though it does seem to detour from the X-Men stories as defined by the comic books. I say seems, I've never really read them, they may be spot on. They just don't match up all too well IMO.<br/><br/>As a pure action film this one doesn't work out too well. The most of the action sequences are just that - pure action. At the one side they try to create a background story, but on the other end they fail to connect it to the things that happen and that makes the film far more fragmented than it should be. Tone down a bit on the graphical effects, tone up a bit on explaining things and you've got a lot better film.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 bored action heroes"

","Despite all the negative feedback, Wolverine really is a worthy entry in the X-Men series. Sure, Deadpool is wasted (except as a setup for a sequel), the effects are shoddy even after completion (a particularly laughable bathroom scene is of note). And finally, yes, the story is predictable and not particularly involving.<br/><br/>It makes up for this with exciting action sequences and Hugh Jackman. Jackman truly has made the role his, and much badass-ery ensues in the film. Also, since I have been asked this by pretty much every girl who knows I saw this, yes, Jackman is topless for approximately half the running time.<br/><br/>Its definitely not the calibre of the first two movies, which really ushered in comic book movies after a bit of a dry spell and in my opinion have only been matched by the first Spiderman, Iron Man and the new Batman films. That bad taste from X3 is definitely wiped away though, and I'll gladly pay for the next entry without too many qualms."

Too much is missing, too much is glossed over, too much is simply left lying in the annals of Untold Story.

","What is wrong with you people? Was it becwause your pwor wittle wolverine got changed from the comics a little? Did your favowit favowit character not appear on screen for 4 hours? Aww. There there, wannabe critics. It wasn't that bad.<br/><br/>Wolverine seems to be the sore spot this summer. An unfinished leaked copy on the internet that half of these people based their reviews on. Critics making comparisons to last years completely overrated Dark Knight, some of them expecting X-Men Origins: Wolverine to be the pinnacle of superhero movies. Suddenly, a bunch of people give this movie a ""one"" rating. Please. It's an action movie that delivers what it promises. It's the over-expectation that causes all the negativity.<br/><br/>Here we see the story of Logan, a mutant born with claws that come out of his hand, in his early years. We find that he ages slowly and heals rapidly (As seen in X-men). He and Victor Creed, who has similar powers fight wars together, until one day, military scientist William Stryker invites them to become part of a mission. Eventually, this leads to a falling out between Logan and Creed. After Logan's girlfriend is murdered, Logan goes on the hunt for Creed, by doing something he doesn't want to do: align himself with Stryker and become a weapon for him.<br/><br/>The movie was short on characterization on some of it's players, because, well, it's focus is Wolverine. We see very little of the Deadpool, Gambit, or other characters. Fans went in and felt cheated that these guys were not on for a long time. I remember watching a movie a long time ago called ""Father of the Bride"" with Steve Martin. I was kind of dumb in saying it was a ""good movie, but we didn't get to really know mom or his daughter much."" My cousin turned to me and said ""DUH. It's called Father of the Bride"", not Mother of the bride, or The Bride"". Bad analogy, I know, but really, DUH.<br/><br/>But let's continue with some bad stuff: As a Wolverine fan that's been reading comics since some of you were still in your father, I would have preferred an R rating. It seemed short for what it wanted to do, moving the storyline too quickly from one scene to the next. As such, it would have benefited from an extra 10-15 minutes. It might have left out an explanation or two as to what happened to characters, or how a situation was worked out. There might have even been a dumb scene or two. But after 4 decades of watching movies, I can say the same thing about a whole slew of other movies that rate highly and still have strange plot issues, bad characters, and cheapness. You go see Shawshank Redemption to see Oscar type performances, you go see a movie like Wolverine to go on auto pilot and be entertained by action sequences.<br/><br/>There's no denying that some of the battle scenes were cool. Come on! Bar room fights with claws? A flying jump to a helicopter and slicing it's blades? A Random Act of Violence against a thick steel door? Countless cameos and hidden goodies? Fans shouldn't be complaining, critics need more drugs, and yes, perhaps Fox should just hand over the rights to Marvel."
"Kevinator007","7","2","5","17 May 2009"," Another superhero movie? Yes! nothing more.
","I have been reading marvel comics throughout my children and teenage years. But I like this movie. Yes, it does not follow the marvel script. Admittedly, the wolverine in marvel comics has usually a darker personae, full of mystery about his past. I say usually, because it is not always the case. The writers of marvel comics have got their own style and I have seen many different attributes given to wolverine down the years in the comics, some radically different to each other. It is only understandable that the director and obviously the production (more suited for family films) of this movie elected to cast their own light to the character. The Batman films have been mostly family film in the past and some utter rubbish, until recently Christopher Nolan was given the task of revamping the bat character. I suppose and hope that this will be the case for wolverine. For now, we have an entertaining sci-fi action film with a few glitches. Not the best story line, but it is action packed. The reason why I liked it must be because it was good to see wolverine given the prominent role in an xmen movie, just because im a fan. To watch without high expectations."

What could have been given more thought is the motivation of the characters, consistencies in the movie, etc. I'm pretty sure that if I announced ""this is a mutant killer"" to a very tough mutant, I'd have security around. Likewise, if I were a mutant and were told ""this is a mutant killer"" I'd do something other than walk away slowly. As usual, the characters and storyline has been changed from what the comics have written, but I've accepted long ago that this is how super-hero movies are going to be created."

","I like going to those types of films because they are fun and makes you just forget about the world. And this film, like any other superhero film is the same. The typical message with some clich√©s, although you can see they tried not to put any clich√© in the film. Some characters were annoying, like Ryan Reynold's character Wade. Other than that the film was action packed and fun. Noisy and action scenes are nothing without the typical explosions, screaming and running. Hugh Jackman of coarse is an accomplished actor so he did good. Others did okay too. The film shows the many sides of Wolverine.<br/><br/>I don't take these types of movies seriously, this is no exception. It is good and nice but nothing new to the superhero genre. It is no Dark Knight or the first Spiderman but still it good."
"MaxBorg89","7","2","5","5 May 2009"," More X-Men than Wolverine, actually
","From the moment Hugh Jackman first appeared as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men, it was obvious his character would be the first choice for a spin-off film: brooding, tormented and totally bad-ass, he's one of the coolest creations in superhero comics. And so here it is, his own movie. Well, at least that's what it was meant to be.<br/><br/>Taking advantage of the fact that Wolverine's origins have finally been unveiled in the comics as well, the film starts with a family tragedy which leads to the shaky alliance between two young stepbrothers in 19th century Canada. Both are gifted with heightened senses, and healing abilities that slow down the aging process, which is why, a hundred years and four wars later, Logan (Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) still look like they're pushing 40. At this point they're recruited by William Stryker (Danny Huston), a military scientist who uses mutants to do the government's dirty work. Unfortunately, Logan is disgusted by all the violence, despite being the most lethal member of the team (what with his retractable claws and all), and seeks a peaceful life. Due to fate - and Victor - that isn't possible, and thanks once again to Stryker, he is given the chance to get back at those who have wronged him. Thus begins a new chapter of Logan's life, one that is best summed up by the new name he has chosen for himself: Wolverine.<br/><br/>As it happens, said new chapter is also the point where the film starts getting it kind of wrong: gone is the introspection and careful look at a conflicted, lonely (super)human being, replaced by state-of-the-art action scenes and a truckload of new characters. Okay, so the showdown between Logan and a helicopter is admittedly a very cool moment, but why the sudden shift in tone, given Jackman (who's also the movie's producer) was lucky enough to get David Benioff (25th Hour) as the screenwriter (but hey, Hit-man writer Skip Woods was also involved) and Oscar-winner Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) as the director? The answer is disheartening and not very unexpected: fan demands. The film's title isn't simply Wolverine, it's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, meaning that once the origin bit was explained, it was perceived as no big deal to randomly insert popular characters from the comics who couldn't be included in the previous X-movies: some of them (Taylor Kitsch's Gambit) work to a certain degree, others (a pre-X-Men Scott Summers) appear at the expense of people who actually fit into the story, like the hilarious Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), whose presence is basically reduced to a teaser for his own spin-off (assuming it gets made, obviously).<br/><br/>Make no mistake: Hood is a skilled director, and the first hour of the film stands out as a very good introduction to one of Marvel's most loved ""heroes"", but much like Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man 3, he finds himself dealing with a second half that loses its focus while trying to please fan-boys (as well as providing a nonsensical explanation for the protagonist's memory loss). On the plus-side, a quick pace means the lesser parts are over quickly, and Jackman, now playing the Canadian mutant for the fourth time, is as charismatic as ever, brilliantly aided by Schreiber and Huston (and the shamefully underused Reynolds).<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not exactly a bad film (it has good action, a terrific first half and a solid cast), but it's painfully obvious this could have been something completely different had it been handed to original X-director Bryan Singer. The post-credits scene seems to suggest a sequel can be expected: fine, but could it focus solely on Wolverine, please? <br/><br/>6,5/10"

These days, I'm looking for comic book movies to be more realistic, when it comes to dialogue and action, example Dark Knight. Wolverine has great action and it's believable. The characters weren't overused or underused. The film was mostly about Wolverine, Sabertooth, and Stryker and that's how it was supposed to be. I still think the other X-Men were good, despite X3, but this is definitely the best one of the series. i do hope to see the same director for the sequels or someone with similar styles."
"yardrummer","7","2","5","3 May 2009"," Not as bad as you think
","First of all if your going into this movie expecting Dark knight or a faithful uncompromising adaption of the Wolverine: Origin comic books you are going to be disappointed. Actually if you are expecting the best movie of the summer your are certainly going to be annoyed. If you want to see Hugh Jackman kick ass as Wolverine then you are going to have a good time. This film succeeds as a Hollywood blockbuster that has the spirit of the Marvel character without leaving non fans in the dark. I imagine the target adolescent audience will eat this up and that is the purpose.<br/><br/>As a long time reader of Wolverine and the X-Men I have always had to take these movies with a grain of salt. I have learned to let go of the fact that Jackman is TOO big to be Wolverine(in the comics he is known as the short guy with an attitude) and prefer to judge the films as a re imagining of the comics to conform to a 2 hour movie. I disagree with some of the other fan boys who say X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE is totally unfaithful to the comics. Bastardized yes, but if you have read the Wolverine solo comics you will notice some of the parallels: young James Howlett killing his real father, Sabertooth killing Wolverine's 1st love Silverfox(later a plot twist(sorry)), the unbreakable metal bonding scene uses lines directly from the Weapon X series, etc. Even though Jackman does not fit my particular image of Wolverine he along with the films creators have used the bits from the comics to demonstrate their appreciation for the history of the character while creating a story that can be told in a coherent 2 hours. As far as Sabertooth is concerned Liev Schrieber may not look like the character but he does a superb job of giving him life unlike the Sabertooth of the 1st movie who was merely a henchmen and comic foil.<br/><br/>There are obvious problems: the CGI is dated, there are plot holes and typical Hollywood clich√©s. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is a real charm but his character is killed much to early. The treatment of Emma Frost in particular is enough to make any X-Men fan want to pee on the screen. I am a big enough fan of Gambit to be happy his character was used at all. Overall this movie is on par with the first movie, better than Last Stand but no where near X2. Thanx."

","Hugh Jackman did a solid job. I really enjoyed the movie, and want to see it again. I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed any of the X-men movies or is a Hugh Jackman fan. I don't go to the theater that often and am more of a DVD person and am glad I got to see it in the theater first. Harry Potter will probably be the next movie I see in a theater.<br/><br/>Spoiler** I would have really enjoyed seeing Wolverine way back in time more, the 1800s and 1900s, that part was summed up really fast. Those are the best Highlander episodes, the ones that show his life back in time. I would have liked to see more mutant woman powers. One of the fun things about the X men movies are that the woman all have really interesting powers that engage the woman audience. It let's me really get into a movie, when I can imagine, want to be, or relate to the female characters. The female parts were short, probably only 15 minutes of screen time in the whole movie. Hugh does really well with scenes with woman. Basically what he is famous for in my book. If only they could have recreated some of the sexual tension that Australia had like at the camp/tent scene, I think the movie would be blockbuster for weeks. If the guys are looking for action, the woman are looking for romance and sexual tension. Something that Wolverine oozes, if a woman is around. <br/><br/>I also have not read the comic books, so there were things I didn't know until reading the reviews now. I thought his brother was a badger, but then they started making references to him being a cat and Wolverine being a dog. Interesting, he is more of a wolf than a wolverine. Did they have two different fathers and I didn't catch it at the beginning? I never quite understood what Zero's powers were. It would have been fun to see more screen time for other mutant's powers. I know they have to cut something out. Maybe they will go farther back in time for the next one, before they explain how his brother becomes sabertooth. I hope there are more, and I also vote for Hugh Jackman to be the next Indiana Jones. His character in Australia was half way there."

Mostly to see how well they tied it all together in the realm of Hollywood.<br/><br/>I am sure this movie did not have nearly the budget that the other X-Men movies had, not only because it didn't include nearly the amount of cast, but the Director, Gavin Hood, is relatively unknown. Some of this is obvious when the effects that we have seen many times are revisited, albeit poorly in this Wolverine installment. There are a few scenes where Wolverines claws come out, and are so cartoonish in the digital effects that were used that it really takes away from the movie at that moment. The director chose to do some very corny and clich√© action sequences like cutting up a fire escape stair case like he is working on a conveyor belt. These are things a more seasoned director would have made sure to avoid.<br/><br/>All in all though this movie is a good addition to the already huge X-Men movie franchise ... but much like the Terminator movies, once the original visionary Director leaves the helm ... the ship just kinda drifts in the same direction. It is still a great 'ship', but if someone else was driving, this movie could have been even better."

","Origins: Wolverine gives a glimpse into the history of one the most iconic characters in the comic book industry showing events before the first X-Men film. Brothers James Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) have, with their unique gift to rapidly heal their bodies, served together in countless wars throughout the 20th century until being recruited into a special ops programme by William Stryker (Danny Huston). Logan begins to tire of this group as he opposes the overly violent tendencies of the operations, and eventually he leaves the group. Years later, Logan is approached by Strkyer to help with a task of national security all while Logan's girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) is murdered by Victor, which results in Logan seeking revenge.<br/><br/>The origin of Wolverine is a rather intriguing story, especially since Wolverine in modern times suffers from amnesia. Of course the adaptation is not entirely faithful. The introduction begins to quickly settling the arrival of Logan's abilities in a few minutes and then flashing to well conceived opening credits. The story continues this fast pace but once Logan leaves the special ops programme the films pacing begins to slow. This becomes symbolic in the change of lifestyle for Logan but after the first half the film begins to become somewhat fragmented, resulting in a story whereby Logan is forced to fighting another character just to move the story on for a few minutes: the dramatic elements begin to lose their importance as the film develops but thankfully the story's finale synthesizes the action and story in a similar manner to the film's beginning.<br/><br/>Many facets to Wolverines life are kept while others, especially in regards to characters are given certain changes. One such change revolves around Deadpool: it is a change which ardent fans may disapprove of but since this is an adaptation, the film works like a retelling of the overall Marvel universe, a concept synonymous with the comic book industry. In fact, Origins: Wolverine becomes indicative of how adaptations should be perceived as a imagining and not always as a as carbon copy of the original text.<br/><br/>The actors and their respective characters are, for the most part, well received. Jackman continues his excellent form as Wolverine, but is able to portray him as a character filled with an internal struggle to do what is right while having a capacity for evil. Schreiber, Jackman's counterpart, proves a useful adversary and an excellent binary opposite to Jackman; where Logan is conflicted, Creed is bloodthirsty. Huston performs a good job as a subtly menacing and smug official who wishes to wipe out mutants while Collins is delicate, if not underplayed in the film. The remainder of the cast all perform adequately and their respective characters are suitably added to the films plot. However, this does not stop a couple cameos being more fan service then actually being truly relevant to the overall plot.<br/><br/>Another person to be complimented is director Gavin Hood (Rendition) who does a delightful job with his cinematography. Granted, he tends to stay on the conservative side of film making, but this never stops him completing some beautifully shot scenes. Though some of the fight sequences are more muted then they should be and it becomes saddening to think that the film's action, while entertaining, could have been more ferocious. An uncut release could remedy that but hopefully the sequel, if there is one, will allow for the actions scenes to all be equally as enjoyable.<br/><br/>However, if Wolverine is to be faulted in area it would be its mixed bag of special effects and CGI. CGI tends to be worse off with the odd action scene looking either too blurry or unrealistic, and even Wolverine's trademark claws appearing far too cartoon-like. The special effects are not too bad with a characters energy beam being very impressive, but another characters defense mechanism being poorly textured. The end result is a mixed bag, and while none of the problems areas truly distract from the overall experience, it is evident that the film required a longer post-production phase.<br/><br/>There is no sex or nudity, with language at a low. Violence is abundant throughout the film but it is never bloody, even with one character being decapitated, though this is never graphic by any means.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a highly pleasurable film: the story is engaging; if lacking in depth; the acting is commendable; the directing is workable and the action scenes are fun to watch. It is a pity that the film is not as violent as it could have been and even more so that the technical aspects, something so well polished in other superhero films, appears incomplete. This plus a few slight niggles to the overall film still allows Wolverine to be among the better half of the superhero genre."

","I'm a comic book geek, and every time I saw films made by Marvel I wondered what did Marvel executives such as Stan Lee or Avi Arad think about their masterpiece titles got translated into so so films. I watched this film with a friend who never read the comic books and only watched the X-Men Trilogy. He thought this film was so-so.<br/><br/>I admitted there were some scenes that were really cool to watch, for example the fight with Deadpool and when Gambit first showed up. But in some scenes the special effect were so obvious and it was really irritating. And Oh My God!! I think they over-exaggerated Deadpool's power. I know he's Marvel's number one mercenary and stuff. But hey, swords coming out of his knuckles? Laser eyes? Oh...puhleaseee... And turning Emma Frost into Silver Fox's sister? I don't think a lot of X-Men readers would appreciate this.<br/><br/>But David Henney and Ryan Reynolds gave a memorable performances although they didn't have that many screen times."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a great popcorn film that I overall enjoyed. It has a lot of action to last you a lifetime and explains why Wolverine is Wolverine and explains his backstory before he became part of the X-Men.<br/><br/>You can also look forward to seeing a lot of your comic book favorites like Gambit, Blob, Cyclops,Deadpool, Maverick and lots of others. I don't want to spoil everything, but the movie contains a lot of claw slashing action, the battles of each World War, and an execution that turns out to be an utter failure.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for some great high flying action, this is the movie I recommend. It is a great comic book film that doesn't kill off the entire franchise and surely beats the somewhat dull reception of X-Men: The Last Stand."
"viofitz","8","2","6","22 August 2009"," The only movie that made me love X-men stuff.
","This movie is definitely became my favorite movie of all time, even though I'm not a fan of X-men stuff. Wolverine/Logan(Hugh Jackman) is pretty damn awesome in here I feel like wolverine's personality is a bit same to me to be honest. Although the story is simple & about vengeance is all the way, but the ""Wolverine"" history is really touching for Logan when he shows his disillusion to Kayla(Lynn Collins). The movie itself i marvelous IMO from the effects, CGI but they got too many goof that we can clearly see. The acting is very well made, Hugh Jackman did a pretty damn marvelous work to rolled Wolverine/Logan by his roar, scream, battle cry, & his personality. 2ndly Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed, he is the most awesome villains act ever. However, judging from the character in the movie, I personally think Victor's character became too weak when he fought Wolverine/Logan in his new form of weapon X, & it seems like after Wolverine/Logan received his weapon X he became more skillful in battle. I'd really want them became a very top tier rival for sure... As for the rest were also great like David North/Agent Zero(Daniel Henney): he is great as a ruthless villain & being good a shooter, Remy LeBeau/Gambit(Taylor Kitsch): I just can't stop laughing to see him got knocked out by Wolverine/Logan by one elbow but too bad his roles is too damn minor, Fred Dukes: I really like when he's miss-understanding Wolverine/Logan calling ""Bub"" to be ""Blob"" is pretty damn hilarious specially for Wolverine/Logan's line ""I didn't call him Blob, I said Bub"", William Stryker/Danny Huston: To be honest Danny Huston don't look like a villain character but somehow it fit to him since I personally hate to see his face as Stryker, Kayla Silverfox(Lynn Collins): hmm... She's fresh from her look & it suits well to be paired with Hugh Jackman, I really like her cries when Wolverine/Logan shows his disillusion to her but the worst is I don't want her die, because I personally tought Hugh Jackman & Lynn Collins could be a great couple. Also her little sister is look nothing like her at all + I don't like her leaving her sister like that without checking what's going on on her sister, & Wade Wilson(Deadpool): In the first he's pretty damn annoying by his mouth, & love it of what Stryker did to him to make him Weapon XI & hilariously sewing his big mouth. I think that's all that I can say & to people who read this I'd suggest u to watch this movie if u haven't watched. Lastly I can't believe it there's a sequel! Can't wait for the sequel...."
"SpndlShnks","2","2","6","17 August 2009"," Awful. Just awful.
","OK, where do I begin?<br/><br/>Having read all of the X-Men comics and the limited edition Origin series that the film was loosely (and I mean loosely) based on, I was appalled to find a number of things: <br/><br/>My first major disappointment is that the story of Origin, whilst only 6 issues long, is well crafted, well put together and truly shows the development of the character of Wolverine. In the film, this lasts for all of 3 MINUTES, in which we see a scrawny young boy, Jimmy, who is always ill, in bed. A few moments later his claws appear for the first time and he kills the man who killed his father, who, with his dying breath tells him that he is Jimmy's real father. Puke. In the comics it is implied that Thomas Logan is his real father and that Dog Logan was Sabretooth. In the film it is blurted out in the most clich√©d way possible and then that section of the story ends, and we are catapulted into a montage of Wolverine and Sabretooth fighting in every war imaginable, and then on to the 1970s, with no further development of any thing that was brought up in the short opening section. <br/><br/>Hello? This movie is called X-Men ORIGINS: Wolverine. They just got the entire story of the tragedy of his early life, leading to him slowly becoming more and more the character we know and love today. Instead, in all but the first 5 minutes of the film we see Wolverine as Wolverine, the fully developed character! <br/><br/>Major disappointment number 2 is that the film is full of unnecessary special effects and fight scenes that don't add to the story whatsoever, just please the mindless fans come to see a mindless action packed superhero flick. The number of times he fights his 'brother' are extortionate, even if they are arch enemies. Also they kept on bringing in new characters for someone to fight, which brings me onto my next point... The characters in this movie are one of the defining worst parts. None of them, bar Wolverine, who had already had three movies to define himself, were developed, and most only appear for a few minutes. On top of this, they bear little resemblance to the characters from the comics that they were based on. Standing out are Silverfox, whose personality, mentality and even her powers were completely changed; Stryker, who quite frankly shouldn't have been in the movie at all; James and Heather Hudson, who for no conceivable reason are changed to Heather and Travis Hudson, the kindly old simple folk who get killed swiftly; Blob and Kestrel, for the clich√©d and overly stereotypical portrayals of their characters; Agent Zero, for the complete lack of him being German, or possessing the right powers, or really having anything to do with David North; and most importantly: Gambit and Deadpool. <br/><br/>Now these two are two of the coolest characters Marvel has ever created, but the portrayal in this film is dreadful. Gambit is wrong in so many ways I'm not even going to mention them in the interest of space, so let's concentrate on Deadpool. Firstly, they overload him with unnecessary powers that just aren't needed, even in the context of the film - including, bizarrely, retractable adamantium katanas, which apart from being much less practical than real katanas, are quite obviously longer than his forearm, and yet you can clearly see him walking around with bent arms in one of the scenes... On top of this, Wolverine's power was the last one added, yet Logan only survived the adamantium bonding process due to his healing factor, and Wilson had already undergone that experiment by the time Wolverine's powers were added! Secondly, although I was impressed with Ryan Reynolds' portrayal of Wade Wilson (in the non action scene that is), next time you see him they've sewn his mouth up! The producers for some reason decided that the best course of action would be to remove the merc with a mouth's mouth. Now that's genius. Thirdly, in the comics Wilson has terminal cancer, thus providing him with a reason to undergo the Weapon X project, but in the film, there is no incentive - it just kind of happens, with no explanation as to whether it was voluntary or not or anything of the sort!<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important point is that unlike the other three X-Men movies, which although they angered me for bearing no representation to the comics, were in themselves not all that bad movies. Not great, but not awful either. This, on the other hand, isn't a good movie when looking at it as if it were an original story, rather than an adaptation. <br/><br/>The whole thing seems awfully rushed, and put together at the last minute simply to please the people who watched the first movies and liked 'the spunky little one with the shiny claws'. There are a huge number of continuity errors within the film itself, let alone between films or with the comics, and the suspense, tension and romance all seem false. The number of plot holes and mistakes is ridiculous - there are far too many for me to jot down here.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie that, if executed correctly, could have far outclassed 'The Dark Knight'. Instead, what we get is a poorly thought out, action packed blockbuster that doesn't satisfy its own title. On top of all this, I've recently learnt that a sequel has been announced and confirmed. That's right! A sequel to an origins story! Presumably since it is a sequel, rather than a prequel, we're in for another treat of mindless action and violence, a whole bunch of characters thrown in for no apparent reason, and two hours of a fully developed character developing his character. Count me out."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) is exactly what the title of the movie says: an origin tale for the character of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). It's a shame the film's so blatant, uninspiring and generic as it is because there surely were enough ingredients to make the story and the visual aspect of it in a much more compelling and intriguing way. I'm not a fan of the superhero genre or the Marvel comics and don't know much about the character of Wolverine but still there had to be more potential to the character than presented here if the character's supposedly such a pop cultural icon. The finished film is just an rush through the many meaningless and dull action scenes, throwing in ‚Äùfamiliar faces and characters‚Äù from the previous films like there were no tomorrow and keeping up with the tradition of poor dialog in the X-Men -movies.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is a decent actor but he doesn't have much to do in the film other than constantly keeping a menacing or troubled expression on his face and showing off his trained upper body. Liev Schreiber supports as much as a guy running on four legs with extremely long and powerful fingernails can ‚Äì so not that much. Rest of the cast slumbers their way through the flick, or at least the two or three minutes they each get ‚Äùon screen time‚Äù.<br/><br/>The action is as mentioned above very uninspiring and something seen so many many times before: a lot of CGI and slow motion, not much imagination or creative effort. And when there isn't much in the film besides the action, you ponder what's really left; lousy dialog, dull camera-work and set design, poor acting and ridiculous story progression...<br/><br/>Come on movie people, put some real effort the next time you try to steal the people's money. 1/4"

","Poor Wolverine! You would think a mutant with razor sharp, unbreakable Adamantium claws would have a better edited, more tightly scripted screenplay for his movie, but I'm afraid not. X-Men Origins: Wolverine starts all the way back when Wolverine and Sabretooth are wee lads and follows them through the Civil War, World Wars I and II, Vietnam (what, no Korean War?), and some post-Nam black ops in Africa before Wolvie finally bonds with his Adamantium and breaks free. This is the critical point in the plot and should have been the opening scene; everything else could have been told in flashback or‚Äîbetter yet‚Äîexcised.<br/><br/>X-MO: W is also loaded down with second-string mutants‚ÄîGambit, Blob, Wraith, Deadpool, Agent Zero, Bolt, Silverfox‚Äîthat seem to have been thrown in strictly for their action figure merchandizing possibilities. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber do their best to try and hold this mess together, but mostly they are reduced to spouting Cain and Abel platitudes and growling at each other. In the end we see a group of young mutants, including Cyclops and Emma Frost, being herded away by Professor X‚Äîan obvious tie-in to the Young Mutants TV show Fox is said to be preparing. There is a final after-the-credits scene of Wolverine drinking sake in a bar in Japan, an apparent setup for a sequel, but given the poor box office for this incoherency, that seems unlikely. I had hoped after the disappointing X-M 3: Last Stand, Fox would try to redeem this franchise, but no dice."

","I am. As a good wife I go for my husband and sometimes these movies are quite good like Star Trek. Or The Revenge Of The Sith. But Wolverine, aside from Hugh Jackman's ripped physique, was just the same old same old sad summer action flick with nothing that interesting going on. I hated Star Trek growing up but I liked the new film. I have no idea who Wolverine is, and I still don't, so the least they could do was give me some more meaty on his meaty manly man character. Instead they give us more routine action and not enough involvement in his origins; which are confusing in any case. My husband loved it and I'm sure we'll own the blue ray when it comes out. And on that day, I will be in bed early with a good book. Or re watching some of my own faves to drown out the sound of the explosions coming from my den.

","The film focuses on the violent past of mutant Wolverine and his time with Team X, before Wolverine's skeleton was bonded with the indestructible metal adamantium. The plot also details his early encounters with Colonel William Stryker, the Weapon X program, Wolverine's interactions with other mutants and his complex relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed.<br/><br/>Hearing the reactions from the majority of the people that have seen this film, I'm not surprised that the movie was disappointing. This film suffers from what X-Men 3 did and more: It has too many characters in one short running time, although the film felt like it never seemed to end. Including that, the story wasn't that good and the film felt like it should have never been made. What's the point? Why would anyone want to know the origins of Wolverine? Well, if you do, why would anyone want to sit through such a disappointing origins story?<br/><br/>It's apparent the filmmakers didn't spend a lot of time with the whole story. I've never read the comics so I wouldn't know if the film translated what was on page to screen or not. Even in the first few scenes, I was laughing through my mind because of Wolverine's horrible-looking bone claws. The origins story also didn't add much to Wolverine's past. And for the first time, I'll say that the CGI in here was a bit cheesy and very unreal. When Wolverine actually plays with his steel claws for the first time, the CGI looks horrible and cartoonish.<br/><br/>With the many characters here, I felt like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and Will i Am were the best ones here. I feel sorry for Jackman, because you can tell he's trying to do his best with the source he has been given, along with the rest of the cast. I found Lynn Collins very annoying, though, as Wolverine's girlfriend. Ryan Reynolds was decent, although he appears for only a short time in the film and Taylor Kitsch was good too as Gambit.<br/><br/>With the negatives aside, I liked one thing: Split the film into three parts and I liked the last, third part. I really found the film enjoyable from that to the end, including an interesting way how they connected the last scenes to the first X-Men film. I also found the action sequences above par, especially the last sequence. Overall, I'm not surprised that I was going to be disappointed. I do like the third part of the film, though so I'll give the film that. If you're a fan, you can see it, although it may not be the best origins story to tell."
"ThatMonkey","8","2","6","12 May 2009"," Teen Wolf!
","I am going to start out by saying Marvel makes some really bad films. I had a girlfriend tell me that if I ever took her to see something as horrible as Ghostrider again, she'd dump me. Lucky for me, I knew that bad movies weren't the issue, so it was not a serious loss when the relationship didn't work out.<br/><br/>That doesn't change the fact that Fan 4, both Hulks and other Marvel titles have almost completely turned me off from Marvel having the potential to deliver. Iron Man was good, but nothing to base your entire empire on. It was a huge hit, but I'm sorry, takes more than one big hit to win a game unless you've been in it long enough for your legacy to speak for itself.<br/><br/>I have to say out of the previous X-Men titles, 2 was the best and that was C- in my book. Last Stand was a flat out F and I was close to skipping this title all together.<br/><br/>I am going to give Wolverine a B+. Two things kept this title from A status and might prove to be the issue keeping Marvel from greatness. #1, Cheesy special effect. Some effects here were good and other looked like they were straight out of Roger Rabbit. Part of making the fantasy believable is looking at the screen and not have it be so obvious that it's a sound-stage or CGI. That completely takes you out of the fantasy and puts you back in the theater. This franchise is too important to cut corners in post production<br/><br/>#2, I'm really tired of seeing films that are dumbed down for the son I don't have. Wolverine is known for going berserk and it still hasn't happened! Wolvie did use his claws quite a bit, but for some reason slashing and stabbing produced no blood. I'm sorry, you don't save the world without mopping up the place with some bodies, even Star Wars did that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the story was amazing and the acting was good. It's the technical side that kept this movie from being every bit the classic that Star Trek will go down as."
"kunalkhandwala","4","2","6","11 May 2009"," Wolverine is bland, predictable and dull
","Had X-Men Origins: Wolverine been the 1st X-Men film, the other 3 would not have seen the light of day at all. Wolverine is nothing but another revenge film about a superhero with powers that make him almost invincible. Director Gavin Hood could have made such a good film that would have revived the X-Men series but instead, he chose to benchmark films like Daredevil and the first Hulk movie and in the end, barely managed to better them. Wolverine is a disaster. The young boy witnesses the death of his father and along with his mutant powers and a friend, runs off into the night to explore his might. Thus, we see the duo fight through the civil war, the world wars and the Vietnam War but unlike Dr. Manhattan, their impact seems to be minimal even though their instant healing powers make them bullet-proof as well as age-proof. Thereafter, Colonel Stryker enrolls them into a black-ops unit of mutants who go on a killing spree in Lagos and much like in the Watchmen, Logan walks away from his team as his principles differ from the murderous intentions of the rest. Even after Logan finds solace in the Rockies with his girlfriend, his psychotic brother Victor and Colonel Stryker return in his life causing loss, tragedy and rage. His thirst for revenge forces him to take on Stryker's proposal of becoming a part of the Weapons-X program where his mutant abilities take a metallic twist. The battle is then between Stryker's forces and Logan as he realizes the manipulation of evil only too late.<br/><br/>Thin as a wafer and redundant as a normal salted one at that, Wolverine does not compel with story, plot, twists or characterization. First of all, what is the super-strength of Logan that makes him 'Wolverine'?? Retractable Metal claws that can scrape through anything and instant healing abilities that make him bullet-proof? These powers are more convincingly depicted in the 3 X-Men movies than in his solo movie here. Wolverine is supposed to be an enraged super-hero with attitude and temper issues owing to his past but he's more like a sorrowful, boring, calm guy with claws that are not put to much effective use besides the occasional action. More interesting is his nemesis Victor, who is portrayed to be a more evil and vicious character than any in the movie with powers equaling that of Wolverine. None of the characters in the film stand out due to poor characterization, worse casting and dull performances. This could easily have been a great build up to the X-Men series with interesting focus on the other superheroes of whom we get only a glimpse. The fall-out of the black-ops unit, the Weapons-X program, Logan's horrific childhood and him coming to terms with his superpowers are important aspects of the film that have been rushed through. If that wasn't enough, we are stuck with Wolverine's revenge-seeking saga against two protagonists who easily stand out more than him in character. No witty one liners, no breakthrough action sequences and familiar computer graphics take out whatever we would expect from an action-packed superhero film. <br/><br/>Where is the compelling story telling that re-defined and revived superhero franchises such as the Incredible Hulk and Batman Begins? Where is the depth in story and characterization? What about some revolutionary never-before-seen action sequences? It is just such a disappointment to watch a superhero movie fall so flat and turn out so bland as compared to some of the recent works that we have had the pleasure of watching. - 5.48 on a scale of 1-10."

Looking at it from the perspective of the comic books, this film contains many characters that played a role in Wolverine's development. With some of the subject matter this film explores, it creates some vast inconsistencies with the X-Men trilogy.<br/><br/>Watching this film, I found myself repeatedly disappointed. There were some enjoyably comical moments in the film; however, given the subject matter of the script, they seemed ill-placed. I feel the script was sluggish and inconsistent with the comics and films, the special effects were a step-down from the X-Men trilogy, the action sequences were overdone, the acting was weak (save for Hugh Jackman), and the pacing was very poor.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this film was not enjoyable, save for a handful of comical moments.

","Where did Wolverine come from? How did he get his adamantium skeleton and claws? If these are questions that troubled you, you're a dork. Also, you're a dork who never read the comics, since you'd already know the answer if you had. But for those who haven't read them and are still curious, this film explores Wolverine's days before there was such a thing as the X-Men.<br/><br/>This film has been receiving many, many poor reviews. Some have called it cheesy, others bland, others repetitive. I can see all that. And I'm not going to lie and say it was a great film, because it really wasn't. But was I entertained? Actually, yes. For what they had to work with, I think the outcome was pretty decent -- this is, after all, the fourth film in the series. Success cannot be maintained forever.<br/><br/>I appreciate the great inclusion of relatively obscure characters -- such as John Wraith. The writers clearly cared about the comics, so we have to give them credit for not trashing them entirely. Silver Fox? Never thought I'd see her in a movie. So, this was pretty cool in that regard. But then, things got a bit weird.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about young Cyclops, and the Deadpool story fails entirely. Deadpool has been one of my favorite comic characters for many years, and what they bowdlerized him into is just terrifyingly stupid. I can understand Ryan Reynolds as a casting choice, even if I'm not a fan, but what they turned the actual character into as the film progresses... what the heck? As I said, young Cyclops was strange -- the attempt to add in other characters just seemed lame. The Blob? Really? And Gambit, although popular in some circles, had no real point to being in this movie... and wasn't a terribly interesting guy.<br/><br/>Fans of the three ""X-Men"" films will likely see this, and perhaps enjoy it. Or be let down. I guess it could go either way. Sales on this one seem to be slumped, yet I wouldn't be surprised if one more film in the series was made. With the success of ""Iron Man"", the ""Spider-Man"" movies and more, Marvel can afford to take some risks. What would be the next film? Unclear. No other character has the solo appeal of Wolverine.

","I am not a die hard comic book fan but I do enjoy them and I enjoyed the other X-Men movies that were made. I was excited when I heard Wolverine was coming out and then disappointed when I heard so many bad reviews. I went to go see it anyway and it really wasn't that bad. All the actors did a good job and the special effects were cool. I have to say though that the writing was the film's main flaw. If they had had some half-way decent writers then the film would have been ten times better but as it is, it is still a sun action flick with super heroes kicking ass.<br/><br/>I think the main reason it was panned was that people were expecting it to be on par with The Dark Knight, which was the best comic book based movie I have ever seen. I think it is the standard that all comic book movies are being held to now and that is a good and bad thing.<br/><br/>No Wolverine wasn't bad but if you are going expecting to see a movie to rival The Dark Knight don't go because you won't enjoy yourself. If you want a fun action flick then I recommend it."
"tburke85","6","2","6","8 May 2009"," Wolverine Is A Decent Movie With Flaws
","X-Men Origins Wolverine is a decent comic book movie brought to the big screen its no Dark Knight or Iron Man but it's certainly no Elektra or most recently Punisher War Zone. The film follows the story of James Howlett and his transformation into Logan also known as Wolverine. The movie answers a lot of questions about his character and is an entertaining action adventure with some flaws. But fortunately the good outweighs the bad. The director Gavin Hood does a good job of keeping Logans character at the center and well choreographed action sequences at a steady pace. As far as the acting goes everyone pretty much did a solid job of bringing these characters to life. Hugh Jackman was born to play Logan/Wolverine and he does a great job with the character. He's a man who's sick of fighting and just wants a normal life. Jackman's Wolverine is a man conflicted with feelings of anger, rage, guilt, regret, and revenge. Equally impressive is Liev Shreiber as Wolverines half brother Victor Creed/Sabretooth. He brings a lot to the role of a man who feels betrayed and abandoned by his brother. Creed is a mirror image of what Logan could be if he fully embraced his dark side. Tyler Mane who played the character in the first X-Men film by Bryan Singer did a good job with that role. But his character felt more like a henchmen and he didn't have much dialogue. He wasn't in it that much either because the focus seemed more on Mangeto and Mystique than him. Besides two fights with Wolverine his character was a bit disappointing in the first one. Shreiber makes for a menacing Sabretooth just like Mane but fortunately in this one he gets a lot more screen time and is much more developed. Danny Huston also does a solid job as Striker taking over for Brian Cox. He's man who always has a secret agenda and can never be fully trusted. Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox is strikingly beautiful yet mysterious woman with a secret of her own. Out of all the supporting characters the only one to leave an impression was Gambit. In his first big screen appearance Taylor Kistch a relatively unknown does a good job as the Cajun thief Remy Lebleau also known as Gambit. He doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but he does leave an impression and his brawl with Wolverine is a very impressive fight sequence. Gambit gets about 10 to 15 minutes of screen time but his appearance isn't as nearly as disappointing as Venom's was in Spider-man 3. Maybe he might get his own origin story one day. Mostly everything works from the pace to the action that become more frenetic as the movie goes on. There were however a few things I was disappointed one thing was Ryan Reynolds character Wade Wilson/Deadpool. He gets at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time no lie. He shows up early on and then his character disappears until the final third act. With news of a possible spin off of his character in the works maybe it can do justice to his character because this one doesn't unfortunately because Reynolds is great in the small role he does have in the movie. The same can go for Dominic Monaghans character Chris Bradley/Bolt who can control electricity. His role in the movie seems sort of pointless and is nothing more than a brief extended cameo. The rest of the supporting cast do an admirable job in their roles including Will.i.am in his acting debut as teleporter John Wraith, Danny Henney as expert marksman Agent Zero, and Kevin Durand as Fred Dukes/The Blob, but unfortunately none of them aren't as fully developed as Wolverine and Sabretooth. The movie at least to me also felt a bit rushed even with a running time of 107 minutes. If the film had been longer and focused a little more on Deadpool or Gambit to name a few giving their characters more screen time instead of giving them brief cameos the movie would've been a better. Besides it's flaws X-Men Origins is still an entertaining comic book film plenty of action, fist fights, explosions, chases, and some humor that make for an enjoyable film to watch."
"skinnyjonob","5","2","6","7 May 2009"," If you liked The Matrix Reloaded you'll love this
","X Men Origins: Wolverine reminded me a bit of The Matrix Reloaded. It's a sequel (or in this case prequel) of an incredible movie, yet despite a few impressive scenes the new addition falls horribly flat. I had never watched or read Xmen as a kid and was very skeptical about seeing the first film. I was extremely impressed and soon became quite a fan. Yet everything that made the first two films so amazing (and even the third to a lesser extent) is missing from this film. The deep themes of segregation and social acceptance are all gone and replaced with a very simple one track theme of revenge. The relationship between Wolverine and Sabertooth is also nowhere near as deep or interested as Professor X and Magneto. Unfortunately the only characters in this new film that are interesting get far too little screen time.<br/><br/>I won't give plot lines away, I still enjoyed parts of the film but to sum up, if you thought matrix reloaded was amazing and you don't mind action without great story telling then you'll still get a lot out of this. For those of us who felt Reloaded was very disappointing and they should have left the Matrix as a stand-alone classic film, you'll probably feel the same way about X Men and X Men Origins."

","Phil's Quick capsule Review: Not as bad as you have heard but not that great either, Wolverine is an average film with a few great performances.<br/><br/>The Hollywood Exec Pitch: It's another comic book movie. What's that I hear¬Ö money!<br/><br/>The Review So after a leaked work print, a rather naff looking couple or trailers and enough Jackman press junkets to fill a book (bless he has been busy) the first real big film of the year is here (no Fast & Furious didn't count). But is it more X 2 than X-men: The Last Stand? <br/><br/>Wolverine lives a mutant life, seeks revenge against Victor Creed (who will later become Sabertooth) for the death of his girlfriend, and ultimately ends up going through the mutant Weapon X program to become the metal framed monster of the comic books. <br/><br/>After dominating the first three X-Men movies Wolverine, the guy with the big side burns, bad temper and the rather scary claws gets his own movie with X-Men Origins: Wolverine as we find out what made Logan into the berserker we all know and love. Well that was the idea. <br/><br/>Disappointingly in reality we mostly just get the last few years before the first X-Men movie, save for a very well laid out title sequence where we see a brief history of Logan and his brother Victor Creed (future Sabretooth) fight their way through a host of wars. This by far would have been a more interesting story than the one we got, which has to jump through hoops to ensure continuity with the later X-Men movies. Worse still most of the story you already know, especially if you're a fan of either the films or comics. <br/><br/>We know that Sabretooth doesn't die because he fights him the first X-men movie. Same for William Stryker who appears in X-Men 2. Cyclops can't see Wolverine because when they meet in the first film they have never met before. So for the most part of the film you pretty much who lives and who dies, which makes for a hollow experience overall. <br/><br/>Other franchise pleasing cameos such as a CGI'd younger Patrick Stewart, Gambit & The Blob also get short changed. Even the Weapon Eleven (Played by Brit Scott Adkins) doesn't work either. What is cool on paper ‚Äì a hybrid mix of mutant powers and skills - is introduced so late in the game that he serves little point than to (quickly) die. As for the constant Sabretooth v Wolverine fights that drive the story¬Ö when they meet again in the finale what should be the epic smackdown between the two brothers is just a damp squid due to the fact that the we know that Sabretooth can't die. No tension. No emotional connection. <br/><br/>That said it's not all bad. It's well made and is well paced. Liev Schreiber, who at first seemed a rather baffling choice for Sabretooth being that he isn't exactly a big bloke, is very good as is Jackman (but not quite enjoying it as much as he used to). The effects aren't bad and the story (whist often a bit silly) drives the film nicely and at least gives proper motivation for the characters and the few proper action scenes there are aren't bad. Although, frustratingly, most of the action (save for the short Weapon Eleven fight) and explosions are in the trailer AGAIN. The short of it is this isn't a bad film. It just isn't great either. Director Gavin Hood has done his best to inject some pace and invention into the film but in terms of story it's a real let down as we either know what's coming or don't really care. <br/><br/>Let's hope any future Origin movies correct this and go back to the old fashioned way of film-making¬Ö writing a story rather than a release date. <br/><br/>In short: For fans only. <br/><br/>The Good: Jackman once again<br/><br/>The Bad: Weapon XI/Deadpool. <br/><br/>The Ugly: The ending. Ugh!<br/><br/>Best Bit : Wolverine Vs helicopter <br/><br/>IMDb Rating: 5/10<br/><br/>If you liked this watch: X-Men (8/10); X 2 (8/10); X-Men Last Stand (4/10)"

"Anonymous_Maxine","8","2","6","5 May 2009"," ""Looks like we're gonna need new sheets again, baby¬Ö""
","It is perfectly fitting that the new X-Men movie should include ""Wolverine"" in the title, since none of the three previous movies explained the history of his mutation, although slightly less fitting that ""X-Men"" should be in the title, because it is more like a spin off for Wolverine, the franchise's most popular character, than it is another X-Men movie. Granted, the histories of some of the other X-Men that we know are mentioned, such as Sabertooth, who is the result of Wolverine's brother Victor evolving along darker lines, and Cyclops also shows up, but for the most part we get Wolverine growing to understand his mutation as he is put into a team with a whole new group of mutants.<br/><br/>Not that that's a bad thing, of course. Die hard fans may not be so pleased to see that so little of the new movie has to do with the mutants that we know so far, and while my own knowledge of the comic books is absolute zero, I'm going to go ahead and suggest that the new movie is enjoyable even though it almost certainly doesn't live up to the expectations of the comic-thumping crowd. <br/><br/>The movie opens in northwestern Canada in 1840. Wolverine (now just Jimmy) and his brother Victor witness the brutal killing of their father which is almost exactly the same as the killing of young Rory Devaney's father in The Devil's Own, except for one crucial difference. You'll know it when you see it. It's a moment that comes dangerously close to an homage joke, but the recovery is thankfully quick. Their Canadian citizenship makes for a great scene late in the film that will have Canadian movie theaters erupting with cheers, although it doesn't explain why Jimmy and Victor fight side by side in the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and Vietnam which, unless I'm sorely mistaken, are mostly all more American wars than Canadian. Nevertheless, it's one of the movie's many great sequences.<br/><br/>Anyway, in Vietnam things get a little crazy. Victor loses his cool and has a confrontation with a senior officer that results in the death of one of them, and when a firing squad fails to kill them, they are offered a position on board a super-secret black Ops team so they can REALLY serve their country. <br/><br/>Well, they can serve their neighbors to the south, anyway. <br/><br/>What follows is Jimmy's journey to find a place in the world for himself, and all along the way he has to avoid being used for powers that he has but doesn't even fully understand yet, and he discovers a major project headed by William Stryker (Danny Huston), who is secretly planning to capture all of the mutants' powers and create a single super-mutant with the powers of all of them and, presumably, none of their weaknesses. <br/><br/>A lot of action tension falls away as it becomes more and more apparent that the relevant mutants, particularly Wolverine, are immune not only to death but to injury, but the entertainment level is high and the effects and photography are generally pretty good. There is some pretty disappointing blue-screen work late in the film in it's ambitious climactic scene, although to be completely honest, I was forced to watch a pirated DVD that I bought last week here in China that had 13 other movies on it. The picture quality is of course reduced, but more importantly, somehow someone got their hands on a copy of the movie where a lot of the visual effects weren't even finished, like external shots of planes flying and mostly the entire final scene. There was actually one point where Victor puts his hand on a window and a text label pops up saying ""claws grow."" I'm assuming that in the final version, his claws grew menacingly. <br/><br/>For those of you with access to American theaters, I hope you appreciate the sheer picture quality that you are able to experience, you don't know what you're not missing! X-Men: Origins is not the best X-Men movie (I would argue that X2 was the best so far) and it's a strange choice for director Gavin Hood, whose directing efforts include the hugely impressive 2005 film Tsotsi and 2007's Rendition. He has definitely hit the big time with this movie (like Alfonso Cuaron did when he was asked to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), although it seems like fans of his directing will be unimpressed with his latest choice, but those of us who remember him acting in bad action and horror films like The Curse III and American Ninja 5 will be thrilled at how far he's come! <br/><br/>But even though a lot of fans and critics may not be as impressed with the latest X-Men film than past entries in the series (Roger Ebert was pretty much a dick about the whole thing), X-Men: Origins is definitely a strong film considering that it's the third sequel. If they can keep them at least this good, they could easily squeeze out a couple more."
"SharkSoul","5","2","6","5 May 2009"," ""I'm the best at what I do and what I do ain't pretty"" clearly wasn't a reference about Gavin Hoods direction of Wolverine.
","Where do I begin? As an avid X-men fan and Marvel follower I was highly disappointed with the latest Wolverine installment from the origins franchise.<br/><br/>I should have taken a friends advice which was 'there's to many action sequences in the trailer, I don't think it will be very good' and guess what, it pains me to admit it, he was right.<br/><br/>Did we not learn anything from Spiderman 3? You can't incorporate to many characters into one film and still maintain sufficient development. Deadpool has around 5 minutes, Gambit a similar time period. In order to make a connection, a bond with that character they need screen time but the film felt rushed, diluted even, development for characters was sacrificed with over the top action sequences. I understand that this chapter was used as a door to pave the way for further 'Origins' chapters, it achieved that but in the process let the original fans down and will certainly make me think twice about viewing future installments.<br/><br/>The certificate of this film should of been raised to 15 which would of granted the director a wider lease and maybe they wouldn't of had to use such weak dialogue. I understand that you broaden the scope for ticket sales if you have the age certificate as low as possible but I just felt that the jokes and language used was targeted at a really young audience and sometimes the film felt like it was trying to hard to be funny. 'Whatever you do, don't mention his weight' 'Did you call me Blob? No I called you Bub'????. The boxing match which ensued was ridiculous, cringeworthy at times.<br/><br/>I still find it hard to understand why in a majority of big blockbusteresque films the studio feels the need to have to cast a rapper/rnb artist. Will.i.am certainly wasn't appointed the position of John Wraith on his acting credentials, is this a marketing tool hoping to try and grasp all sectors of the market, music fans anyone? That's the way it feels and I can't think of any other reason as to why he would of been cast. If it isn't Tyrese it's Common and if it isn't Common it's Will.i.am.<br/><br/>The C.G.I was also weak at times, low budget even. Specifically the scene where Wolverine is in the bathroom at the farm with his claws out in the mirror. Maybe they didn't have enough funds after the over the top pyrotechnics from the Michael Bay school of explosions, who knows.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of the film was Sabretooths performance, I'm not a huge fan of Liev Schreiber but he did perform above expectations in his role and I would look forward to seeing him reprise this role again.<br/><br/>I find it hard to understand how you can ruin such a successful formula, but I do believe Brett Ratner started the decline of the X-men franchise with X-3, if only Bryan Singer had stayed on board and not pursued Superman. I give this film 5/10, you have to question what the studio really wanted, a great film and a happy audience or a poor film and huge ticket sales.<br/><br/>I look forward to feedback on my thread."
"diac228","5","2","6","4 May 2009"," Missing the ""Ommph"" of the first two X-Men movies, and missing a decent interpretation of the X-Men
","The X-Men franchise has been riding on the backbone of Wolverine since the very beginning. Hugh Jackman's interpretation of the popular hero made him a major star and the character the frontrunning character of the long-running comic book series. After the mildly controversial Last Stand, 20th Century Fox decides to turn back the clock and focus all their attention on the lead character for an entire movie. Wolverine is the first of potentially many to receive his own movie, his own chance to truly shine. Now, hardcore readers and newcomers can see how he rose from outcast to killing machine. The end result is a totally mixed bag, however, and it boils down to just how hardcore a fan you really are.<br/><br/>If you are hardcore, then you'll most likely receive the same cringing feeling when watching the same movie studio pretty much mercilessly butcher Dragonball into nearly unrecognizable form. Otherwise, you might have a semi-decent time granted you can get past the inconsistent special effects and rather jumbled finale. One would wonder why on earth they skipped past Bryan Singer and even Brett Ratner to hand the director's seat to a man known for drama. One would also wonder why they didn't use the same writers from previous X-Men flicks. Now, this review will tread off into two different paragraphs; one dedicated to the hardcore, one dedicated to the casual.<br/><br/>Hardcore: Prepare to cry. Gambit, easily one of the coolest comic book characters out there, becomes amazingly watered-down and barely is used. Deadpool's look is absolutely different from his comic book counterpart, and is reduced to cameo screen time. As a matter of fact, despite it being a Wolverine movie, the entire film loses a lot of quality when compared to the X-Men movies because of the majority of the heroes and villains sharing such little time on screen. And when they are shown, they don't really resemble the ensemble we are used to seeing.<br/><br/>Casual: The film is a mixed bag in everything. The acting, the pacing, the directing, the editing, the music, the special effects all range from decent to mediocre to even terrible throughout the two hours. The fights themselves aren't very lengthy, and there aren't as many action pieces as one would hope. Jackman definitely isn't to blame here, but he has a tough task of carrying a film that can never quite lift off the ground. Maybe it's because it has to live up to the amazing comic book cinematic one-two punch of last year (Iron Man, Dark Knight). Whatever the reason, Wolverine doesn't quite entertain or overwhelm as much as the better comic book flicks.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Don't expect the greatness of last year, or even X2 for that matter. The film does have its moments, does have its fun moments. However, the film doesn't appeal well to the hardcore and it doesn't fully explain the mannerisms and history of Wolverine, our famed hero. X-Men works best when the diverse cast of characters share equally good screen time with each other, and it definitely doesn't happen here. Butchered characters also hinder the experience."

","I wrote a post a couple weeks ago titled ""On May 1st, you will all look like morons"" or something to that effect. I did so because I had faith, mainly in Hugh and the supporting cast, and the director (and I refused to see the leaked version). The real tragedy of this movie, no doubt, is not only that some of the cast managed to squeak out solid performances -you could see them trying- but the audience is allowed to intuitively observe how much MORE they could have offered. Sadly, something fell apart along the way- be it the direction, editing, or screen writing.<br/><br/>The editing and direction was so shabby, I literally felt as though I was watching an extended trailer- I might say that I've never experienced this before in the theater (maybe this is some sort of cinematic achievement on its own). Every time something was developing positivity (i.e. when Logan finds himself under the care of farmers, some development of Victor' character, or the initial encounter with Gambit) it just, well, fell apart.<br/><br/>Why this movie is getting such poor reviews is not because its inherently bad- its actually pretty entertaining as a movie. Hugh Jackman IS wolverine, and he has a powerful and charismatic presence as the tormented logan (minus the awkward looking to the sky and screaming). Some surprises, action scenes (Wade and his blades), and dry humor along the way were well played. Its not that. Its not even because the fanboys are let down from a Hollywood egotistical departure from the rich comic characters (They are already developed- USE THEM!). Its because the average movie goer figures out along the way how great this movie should have been, how many missed opportunities there were, and how much more the characters could have been developed- we feel an implicit insult in the way this movie was packaged and delivered.<br/><br/>Hopefully they do better next time around, Keep Hugh (and even Ryan Reynolds, I think if given the chance he would be great), get rid of the whole editing/direction/screen writing team (they may work well for other genres, just not this franchise), and go to Japan."

Well what I expected was pretty much what I saw.<br/><br/>A lot of the movie (about 50% really) was just pure hardcore x-men action. I have nothing to complain about when it comes to the action in this movie. It looked cool, stylish, there were even some unique fight scenes that really had me in awe (the last fight scene is just pure awesome). Wolverine's claws looked a little more fake then they did in the X-men movies...but who cares? <br/><br/>Now we go to where the movie had a little fault: the plot. I disagree with most of the user reviews I've read so far. Everyone keeps saying it's horrible and it ruined the x-men series for them. I thought it was good myself. It was not perfect, not near that. Things went a little too fast without any development in a lot of areas which left you feeling a little rushed through the movie. In my opinion, they should have made it into 2 movies, it would have left a lot of room for further development of the characters and some of the wars Logan was in.<br/><br/>I think that the main reason a lot of fans are beating on this movie is because apparently it didn't stay true to the comics. Now I can't comment on this because I haven't read the comics. So if you have read the comics, maybe you'll be more disappointed then me. However, I bet that if you are like me and have not read the comics, you will be delightfully surprised. This movie offers a nice back story and some great action sequences to the series. Heck, I'd recommend seeing this movie just for the ending fight scene.<br/><br/>Cheers! N. Richardson"

The dialogue is sub par at best and the screenplay is very underwhelming.<br/><br/>The direction was extremely top notch which baffles me because this movie turned out to be mediocre at best.<br/><br/>We follow Wolverine on his journey to become one of the most recognizable faces on the silver screen. From other X-Men movies we know that he doesn't remember the animal he once was. This movie continues to make references to the non existent animal ""Logan/James/Wolverine"" is and will become. He is mild at best. This movie barely tapped into the core of who Wolverine is and focused mainly on bridging the movies together. The end result is a huge mess with great acting from the leads and a few laughs from underused characters and a great surprise at the end.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 6/10 because of the technical arts. It's a shame that the story is very lacking. It could of been so much more.<br/><br/>On a side note, the story would of been more serving if they would of stuck with his life in Weapon X which was reduced to a subplot. It seems Fox does this to most of its movies that should be instant classics."
"captkirk_4","6","2","6","2 May 2009"," Entertaining, but the plot got a bit complicated and hard to follow at the end.
","Having no knowledge of X-men other than the movies, I can't comment on weather this accurately follows the comics or not. But I do enjoy this series of movies with the second being the best and the third a disaster. Both Jackman and Schrieber look amazingly built, one almost wonders whether Barry Bonds was sought for advise in achieving that look. Schreiber playing Wolverine's evil twin makes a slight attempt to put on a Canadian accent for the role as in this film we discover both were born in the Canadian far north over 150 years ago. However, after seeing Ice Road Truckers, I would expect the two brothers to have very thick Canadian accents based on their origins. In the movie we meet some early mutants led by a special forces commander on ruthless missions. When the goings become to merciless Wolverine quits to seemingly retire to a life as a lumberjack only to have his past come back to tear apart his seemingly blissful existence. We meet several new mutants and there are some great scenes shot in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Near the end there are several revelations which are hard to follow and the ""plot"" against Wolverine becomes somewhat overcomplicated. One problem I had was that in this film Stryker seemed to have access to science in the late 70's far more advanced than that of the X men in the movies set in the present. Also I seemed to anticipate some sort of entry of Magneto and how he founded his legion of evil mutants in this movie. Especially as I was sure for a moment that we were looking at Mystique in a scene near the end where Wolverine<br/><br/>SPOILER: <br/><br/>encountered his seemingly dead girlfriend at Strykers headquarters in 3 Mile Island. The film is good entertainment, however I wish they would follow this up with more X men film set in the present and forget about the idiotic decision by the writers to kill of Xavier and many of the key characters in the not very good third installment in the X men franchise."

","Overall, X-Men origins Wolverine moves too fast and never establishes a main theme. THe story is overridden with many mutants, but other then Wolverine himself, we don't learn much about any of the other characters. Even Wolverine's story, the main character of the film, felt like it was missing a lot of information. I guess I could've accepted some of that if the action sequences were better, but even they seemed to not carry enough weight for the movie.<br/><br/>I can't say I really disliked the movie. I enjoyed watching both WOlverine (Jackman) and Saber TOoth (Schreiber) chew up the scenery with one liners and some of their scenes, but this film could've been oh so much better. THe action scenes should've been more exciting, and the special effects weren't that great either. I know this movie cost a lot to make, and I found myself wondering where they spent the money at.<br/><br/>My grade will be a 6 out of 10, and I think maybe I'm being a little easy on the film. For all those who liked the X-Men, X-2 is still the best of all four films. I even go as far as saying that X-Men Last Stand was better than Wolverine because the action scenes were much better."
"Apemangalore","5","2","6","1 May 2009"," Still not particularly good, but starts this summer off better than most
","Quick thoughts on the X-Men trilogy: I thoroughly enjoyed the first film, with its compelling storyline, solid acting, and terrific action. X2 improved upon part one in just about every aspect, and is one of my personal favorite comic book films; and while I did enjoy the third movie, I felt that it was a pretty dramatic step down from its predecessor. I went into X-Men Origins hoping for the best, though like most viewers, expecting the worst. Now having seen the film, I have to say that, while still not a particularly good film, Wolverine proves to be a better start of the summer movie season than most.<br/><br/>The acting in the film, first of all, is all over the place. Some performances capture the essence of their respective character perfectly (most notably Logan and, my favorite of the bunch, Gambit), while others simply come across as overdone at times (such as Stryker and Wraith). The script is the real culprit, however, as the film is filled to the brim with cheesy dialogue. There are also a couple of characters from the previous X-Men films who, I felt, were shoehorned into this movie; and while I hate to be nitpicky, Wolverine's ""claws"" looked incredibly fake to me.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, though, Wolverine is an occasionally fun movie. The action, although a bit too frenetic at times, is solid for the most part, with a couple of sequences that truly stand out being the helicopter ""chase scene"" and the film's climax. <br/><br/>While I can understand why this film has already gotten such a bad rap from long-time comic book fans and critics alike, X-Men Origins: Wolverine worked for me, at least to some extent. A good amount of the acting seemed overdone, the dialogue came across as cheesy throughout a good chunk of the film, and some characters felt as though there were placed in the movie just for the sake of it. That said, the occasionally witty dialogue and solid action made it somewhat entertaining.

","Lotta spoilers read only if you saw. If you didn't see this movie don't expect a lot, except some alright action.<br/><br/>Honestly how did they manage to mess this up? They have the Wolverine character whom everybody loves and a great actor for the part. In addition the comics have already chronicled a great story for this character. They had everything they needed... except some sort of competence. The coolest parts were the very beginning showing young Wolverine and the wars he fought. Unfortunately this was only 5 minutes of the movie. They completely befuddled the entire story behind his memory loss. Seriously adamantium bullets? I guess they go through his adamantium skull??? And scramble his brains? So for the rest of the movies he has bullet holes in his skull? Why even bother with this? Stupid. Oh and Scotts ruby quartz aviators? Seriously the story behind him was that he could not control his eyes and only through working with xavier could he control it, but nooo somehow high school cyclops managed to figure out that the one unique rock that can stop his mutant powers is ruby quartz and then he made his own home made aviators. Seriously... Oh and then you have hugh jackman also playing Wolverines father who.... isn't his real father. Why not have jackman play the paternal father? I guess that makes too much sense. Gambit had a good role, but then in the middle of a battle after gambit was out of the picture from quite some time he comes literally bouncing back into the fight. This was just silly.<br/><br/>Besides all these things that would make a comic fan cringe there is the simple fact that they once again tried to do too much, kind of like Spidey 3. There were so many characters that really just were not necessary to bring in or even show. Hence there was very little, if any character development. Wolverines whole love life was rushed and done rather poorly. His GF had one important line which Wolvie then basis himself around for the rest of the movie. The whole faking death thing was rather stupid imo. I really did not expect this to be a great movies, but what I did expect was that they would give me something enjoyable and I was severely disappointed. What we got was a rushed hashed up version of well I don't even know."

","so , i just watched wolverine and i really don't have a hundred percent sure what i make of it. <br/><br/>first, the plot: the movie spans from his childhood mutant manifestation to the moment he loses his memory. and while this actually answers a lot of questions about the enigmatic character, the delivery was painfully lackluster (the painful part being that i really wanted to like this film despite not being the biggest fan of the title character).<br/><br/>i don't however feel it is entirely the director's fault. the script could have been better. i know nothing about film making, i freely admit that, but in some parts, some scenes that could have been more powerful sort of fizzled, and i think it was the script. to an extent, i was not won over by some of the camera work. again, i don't know much about making movies, and i can't quite put it into words after only one screening, but it seemed a little choppy, reminiscent of Brett Ratner's very fast paced short scene technique in X men 3. i understand that there was a lot of material to get through but, it just felt off. <br/><br/>while taking into account that this was a movie about wolverine, some characters were really undeveloped despite being well acted (all of them). while i was thrilled to have gambit in the movie world (finally), i cannot for the life of me tell you what his motivations are in this movie, or who he is.<br/><br/>the movie overall wasn't that bad. at best i say it suffered form overhype. i for one was expecting something killer and sublime from perhaps the most popular of the x men ( and 20th century fox's cash cow). in truth, minus a few questionable moments like Scott's magically heat bearing rays, and Emma's apparent lack of telepathy. it tells a rather good story. questions are answered, and there is a look into the man before he became ""the animal"". it's just not done to the best of it's potential.<br/><br/>what the movie gets right is effects. i won't even go into them because you will remember them and others will wax lyrical about them. nutshell; they were good. what was missing was soul; i left the cinema thinking, ""it's official, no one does an x-men film like Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>yes, x men and X2 weren't without fault. and i was bitter about storm being shafted in the first two movies. but for an initial non fan, he gets the characters and a relatable way to tell their stories. <br/><br/>overall, after putting these not too random thought together, i think it's an okay, solid movie. just don't expect a masterpiece."

Creed's intentions and motifs aren't plain to see. The mutants that lack blades coming out their knuckles hugely lack character, so comic favourites Gambit (Kirsch) and Deadpool (Reynolds) are ruined. They're pawns to draw us in and take our money.

"Al_The_Strange","7","1","2","11 June 2014"," X-Men Origins Wolverine Review
","Wolverine still stands as one of the most prolific, most popular, and most badass superheroes of Marvel lore. The man is literally immortal: he heals instantly, even from mortal wounds, and thanks to that he was grafted with an invincible metal skeleton, complete with retracting adamantium claws. Wolverine kicked plenty of butt in the three main X-Men films, but a stand-alone Wolverine film has always been in the cards, to give fans another chance to see this awesome character in action. So, they made X-Men Origins: Wolverine, in what would be the first in a line of stand-alone prequel movies for each X-Men character.<br/><br/>In hindsight, this proved to be a futile move; despite the film's commercial success, it is easily one of the worst films of the series, and plans to make more Origins films fell through. The film is one hot mess: a haphazard blend of rip-roaring action and plot contrivances.<br/><br/>The good news is that the film is still very tight, highly entertaining, and it does have some great moments. It is really cool to watch Wolverine rampaging through whole hoards of bad guys, taking out hum-vees and helicopters on a motorbike, and fighting mutants around a nuclear reactor plant. The film moves fast and is never skimpy on the action or style.<br/><br/>The story involved in inherently compelling, thanks entirely to the allure of the title character. It is a tragic tale of love, betrayal, and vengeance that helps shape Wolverine into the berserker we all know and love. The plot covers some of the same ground we've seen before in the original X-Men films, but this time you get to see the full background on how Wolverine got suckered into Colonel Stryker's plans. There are a few major twists, which will seem contrived at first glance, but do hold up on repeat viewings. The plot suffers the most with a number of scenes that don't really contribute; many of the action scenes are frivolous, and scenes involving a young Cyclops seem to the thrown in just for the hell of it.<br/><br/>A lot of the film's biggest issues rests with the editing, which is extremely choppy and screwy. A lot of shots are cheaply-cut to cover up deficiencies in the action. Worst yet, most scenes do not transition well from one to another, causing characters to appear at seemingly random places (such as Gambit suddenly appearing on a rooftop, or Victor appearing at the final fight out of nowhere). It is clear that the conflicts between the studio and the director have contributed to a film that's at conflict with itself, unable to find a balance between the heartfelt drama and the hardcore action.<br/><br/>On the plus side, photography is mostly-solid. Performances are a bit of a mixed bag: Hugh Jackman continues to excel at playing his iconic character, and Liev Schreiber is superb as Victor Creed. I enjoyed Danny Huston's and Lynn Collins' performances. Most of the other actors playing the side characters are pretty weak. The writing is pretty weak. This production uses okay sets, props, and costumes. Special effects vary from good to terrible. Music seems uninspired as well.<br/><br/>Wolverine's stand-alone film is not an inherently bad story; in fact, its potential is more effectively conveyed in the film's corresponding video game. Somewhere along the line it got mucked-up, and I blame it mostly on too much post-production tinkering. I still value the film as a guilty pleasure, and it does make for a satisfying stand-alone action flick. In an X-Men marathon, however, it doesn't fit as smoothly with the other films (especially since events in X-Men: First Class contradict this one). Die-hard fans will probably want to check this out once, but for casual audiences, you can do better.<br/><br/>3.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)"
"rjsf96","2","1","2","14 May 2014"," A Mess of A Movie
","I must admit I am somewhere at a loss of how to begin explaining my feelings of Wolverine's first solo outing in the X-Men series. It is the fourth installment and a prequel to the main trilogy that ended with The Last Stand. I always believed that the reason that prevented the first two from being the best of the superhero genre was the fact that there are too many characters to keep track of (don't even get me started on TLS). There are always characters who feel neglected and in need of more screen time. The fact is that to give all of them what they are due then the films would be in excess of three hours, and I for one do not want a superhero film of that length.<br/><br/>It seemed that a film that would just have one main character and none of the other protagonists would be a qualified success, with a more focused film. Boy was I wrong. The film starts with Logan as a young child, he witnesses the death of his mother and through his anger and rage claws start to protrude from his skin, not made of metal but bone. This scene lacks any emotional impact (like many throughout the runtime of this film). The fact is we cannot form a bond with his mother ‚Äì it all happens too soon. Compare it to the death of Bruce Wayne's parents murdered in cold blood and it pales in comparison.<br/><br/>There are many different and interesting paths that this film could take, yet Gavin Hood and screenwriter Skip Woods seem interested in giving a dull, limp, lifeless tale that goes nowhere and achieves nothing. Heck, the audience in the first five minutes must accept that Logan just gets claws because he is angry. How did he get these claws? No idea. The film never explains this and we just have to accept it, because the plot demands that he does. Instead we get to see how Wolverine gets his jacket. Yippee. I don't want to know how Wolverine obtained one piece of clothing. Wolverine eventually undergoes an operation which gives him adamantium injected into his body. Then he forms a relationship with the most clich√©d romantic interest in movie history. It is as if her character was given a list of check-boxes and the screenwriter ticked every one of them. Later, he faces one of the most dangerous villains in the X-Men series ‚Äì Deadpool. Just wait till you see what they have done to him¬Ö This is about as dreary as Origins of Superheroes get.<br/><br/>However, the main problem of the film is that we never care about the main character! How can this be? They have made one of my favourite superheroes duller than ditch water. Wolverine has so much charisma, dry wit and good one liners yet the only reason he is here is for the purpose of action scenes. Within every single one of these pointless escapades, we feel strangely detached. The reason? Wolverine cannot die. In X-Men, Magneto could stop him and control the adamantium that runs through his entire body. In X2, Lady Deathstrike was made of adamantium and proved a powerful nemesis against him. But in Origins he is unstoppable. The one thing that we are told can kill him is a special bullet, which later Stryker changes his mind and somehow says it can only erase his memory which makes the entire film pointless. We already know that in X-Men; Wolverine remembers nothing, so what does this film achieve ‚Äì you guessed it.<br/><br/>This is the rock bottom for the franchise. It is a complete cash grab and not an ounce of effort has gone into this production e.g. Will.i.am is present that tells you all you need to know. Hugh Jackman tries his best as Wolverine to redeem this god-awful tale but even he cannot save it. This is the equivalent of Batman and Robin for the 21st century. Maybe, some Origins were never meant to see the light of day. An unredeemable, noisy and monstrous piece of film, this is what Superheroes were never meant to be about."

","This movie starts with Victor and his sick younger brother James in 1845 Canada. James kills the man who claims to be his father. The brothers fight together from one war to the next. In Vietnam, the brothers are supposed to be executed but end up recruited by Stryker (Danny Huston) joining a group of other mutants. James aka Logan (Hugh Jackman) quits the group leaving Victor (Liev Schreiber) for a life of a lumberjack with girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Victor is hunting down the old team, and Stryker comes by to try to bring Logan back in. When Victor kills Kayla, Logan wants revenge and he's willing to get back in with Stryker who infuses him with adamantium.<br/><br/>It's a lot of growling testosterone without the lighter moments. It's all about Logan's anger without any fun or comedy. Liev is fine and I would like to dig more into his character. They've put quite a few X-Men in this movie. It is probably trying to cover too much origins in this movie. This should be more Cain and Abel. Victor should be as important in this movie. This movie needs a good storyteller and not just somebody to check off a checklist. I'm not sure director Gavin Hood is the man for the job. The movie becomes overloaded."

"Wuchakk","9","1","2","10 August 2013"," A Top Superhero flick
","I admit that 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" started out pretty shaky with the cartoony action sequence after the opening credits (Stryker's force raiding a facility in Nigeria), but the film found its footing and kicked total axx. I like it for the most basic reason people like movies: The story and its characters pulled me in and kept my attention; I was entertained, pure and simple. How so? <br/><br/>For one thing, the movie effectively accomplished precisely what it set out to do ‚Äì unveil Wolverine's origin. It shows Logan's early family, however brief; it establishes his relationship with his brother, Victor; it shows his participation in all the American wars since the Civil War in an excellent opening credits sequence; it establishes his relationship with Stryker and the US government; it shows his inner conflict between universal morality and being an animalistic killing machine; it establishes his capacity for true love and heroism (Kayla and the old couple, as well as going back to save the mutants at the end); it shows how his bones became reinforced with adamantium; it effectively shows how he lost his memory; and why he's known as Logan/Wolverine.<br/><br/>This isn't some mindless action/CGI flick with little dramatic valleys or depth, as some have criticized. As just noted, the film starts out with a dramatic sequence from Logan's youth and proceeds with the dramatic montage of various wars during the opening credits. This effectively sets the tone that ""Wolverine"" is a serious superhero film, like the three X-Men films before it. From there we get touching moments with Kayla, both early in the story and later; as well as dramatic lulls with Victor, Stryker, the old couple, the black guy in New Orleans (I forget his name), Gambit, Cyclops and Professor X.<br/><br/>As far as depth goes, we get Wolvie's intense struggle between flesh and spirit, which we can all relate to one way or another ‚Äì will he selfishly and greedily use his powers to be a moral-less killing machine at Stryker's beck & call or will he use his powers for the good of humanity? Will he take the high pay from the government or will he be content making $18,500 as a lumberjack? We also get his discovery of love with a moving relationship with Kayla, his later struggle with betrayal, and then understanding and forgiveness for Kayla's plight (her concern for her sister). Not to mention a certain character's powerful admission of genuine love at the end. Furthermore we get Victor's headfirst plunge into lawlessness with zero respect for life other than his own but then ‚Äì surprisingly ‚Äì evidence that he still possesses a sense of loyalty to his blood kin. This shows that even one of the main villains isn't one-dimensional. In addition, near the end we see Cyclops as a boy trusting the still small voice he hears somewhere within, which leads to salvation and Xavier, an obvious type of the Holy Spirit or what have you.<br/><br/>One aspect I really liked was the build-up of mystery regarding Stryker's ""island"" lab for mutant experimentation. When Wolvie & Gambit fly over it and it's location is finally revealed it's a thrilling revelation. From there the final act just builds to an explosive climax with the creative destruction of something, the deliverance of the mutants and the revelation of how Logan completely lost his memory.<br/><br/>As far as all the criticism about Wolvie's claws, particularly in the bathroom scene, so they look a little cartoony, so what? They're obviously a reflection of the comic medium of which the film is adopting. <br/><br/>Let me end by addressing some other common criticisms: <br/><br/>The helicopter explosion: This was thrown-in for the explosion and simply to show Wolvie's ultra-coolness. Logan would have no concern about the explosion due to his mutant healing factor; after over 150 years ‚Äì so many wars and so many mortal wounds ‚Äì such an experience was now mundane.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the non-action scenes: I thought a lot of this dialogue was witty and busted out laughing 7-10 times during the film. As far as the verbiage being weak, it's a Wolverine flick where most of the characters are warriors or kids, not James Fenimore Cooper.<br/><br/>Kayla's moon parable: This was worth it just for the hilarious ""Koo-koo-ka-choo"" line and I found it a very creative touch. Not only does the legend link to Logan & Kayla's relationship, including Logan accusing her of being the ""trickster"" later in the film, it provides Logan his namesake, Wolverine! In short, it wasn't some worthless tale thrown in just to show Kayla was Native American.<br/><br/>Criticisms about Deadpool: The movie is showing Deadpool's FIRST appearance only; after all, it's ""X-Men ORIGINS."" As far as his twirling head and the laser eyes destroying the tower ‚Äì how awesome and creative! Film is a visual medium and they knocked it out of the park with this one. As for Deadpool being silenced, stick around for the post-credits scene.<br/><br/>The bullet to the brain (SPOILER): This was the perfect way to explain Logan's complete memory loss. Think about it: Being shot in the brain is the closest to death Logan would ever come, but his healing factor kicked in and renewed the damaged brain tissue. His restored brain would be as good as new, but with Logan's memory wiped clean.<br/><br/>The inclusion of mutant kids as hostages supposedly just for the fun of putting names there: The movie's called ""Wolverine"" so it focuses mainly on him, but it's also called ""X-Men Origins"" and so naturally details the very beginning of the X-men. I enjoyed seeing Cyclops as a kid in the film, but I'm glad they didn't take the focus off Wolvie by getting bogged down with Cyclops' story or anyone else's.<br/><br/>GRADE A-"
"Sisiutil","3","1","2","19 January 2013"," Too much action, too little character
","Here's an irony for you: take one character out of a successful three-film franchise about a team of superheroes, put him in a film of his own... and he gets less character development than he did in any of the three previous films.<br/><br/>Apparently, the intention of producer Hugh Jackman and others with this film was to do more of a ""character-driven"" story. If that was their intention, they failed miserably. X-Men Origins: Wolverine suffers from far too little time spent developing character and, thereby, emotional resonance. Instead, we get an overdose of action. The problem is, when you don't care about the characters, you don't care about the outcome of the action very much, no matter how well-done those sequences are.<br/><br/>The opening title sequence, which shows Wolverine and Sabretooth fighting through over 100 years of war, is typical of this flick. Everything whizzes by so we can get to the next tidbit of eye candy. All the characters and their relationships are underdeveloped to the point of being caricatures. It's a shameful waste of talent, especially that of the two leads, Jackman and Schreiber.<br/><br/>This movie also commits a similar sin to that of the other recent X-Men movie (First Class): instead of focusing on the potentially-fascinating relationship between two leads, the filmmakers instead feel obliged to shoehorn in as many characters from the X-Men universe as possible. I suppose this is some attempt to court favour with the fans, but instead it just makes the movie worse; it takes time away from characters we should care about most, and leaves us with unsatisfying peeks at other characters who deserve more development.<br/><br/>Part of the fault lies with the very idea of trying to tell Wolverine's origin story. Anyone familiar with the character's long, convoluted back-story in the comics will tell you that there's just too much narrative to distill in a satisfactory fashion into a single movie. They would have been better off basing the film on Frank Miller's excellent Japan-based Wolverine mini-series, which leaves Wolvie's origins out of the narrative entirely. As I understand it, that's what they're doing for the next Wolverine movie, so I have hopes that it will turn out better. Then again, it couldn't be much worse than this noisy mess."

","Well, where to begin? I am not even sure what to say, but I know how I feel about this film. For one thing, the title is not very artistically conceived, and I consider that a retrospective harbinger to the issues present in the film itself. After the interesting opening scene, the entire ""let us now recap decades of story action in one montage"" begins the trend of trying to tell far too much story far too quickly, without regard for finesse. Telling a good story is often helped by limiting the scope, allowing more time to really look at the characters and get inside their minds.<br/><br/>The whole ""look"" of the film is very ""glossed over,"" with a certain sort of sheen to it that I find nauseating (similar to Lord of the Rings, but much worse here). Perhaps that is a technique to help the visual effects blend in, but to me it just makes all of it look fake. And then there are sequences such as the one in which Wolverine flies through the air, slicing through helicopter blades with his claws. Now, I know that adamantium is the stuff, but come on. That is bending reality too far, and I could not suspend my disbelief to accommodate it.<br/><br/>There are lots of characters, and while the cast and acting are all pretty good, the story is what trips them up. Gambit is unsatisfying. Stryker seems pretty vanilla compared to his portrayal in X2, but that may be excused since he is younger here. I am not an X-Men know-it-all, but the whole film just feels to me like a mess of far too many elements being thrown together in hopes of something good emerging. Who was editing this film? I assume that time constraints were in play.<br/><br/>The one thing that I think is truly great about this film is the brief segment in rustic Canada, where Logan/Wolverine is working as a lumberjack and spending quiet moments with Lynn Collins' character (Silverfox?). There are some absolutely beautiful scenes, in particular the one at night where she tells him the Native American lore about the moon...and the Wolverine. They could have made a *great* film by focusing on that aspect of his backstory, but instead decided to cram nearly a century of time, tons of peripheral characters, and a relentless barrage of often ridiculous action sequences in a couple of hours. Sigh. I cannot recommend this as a good film. For an X-fan, it is of interest in the same way as Star Wars Episode I is of interest to classic a Star Wars fan...<br/><br/>For the record: (X-Men 9/10) (X2 10/10) (The Last Stand 4.5/10) (First Class 9/10)"

","I liked the first 3 X Men movies. They had something that this movie does not: A good script.<br/><br/>The concept of the X Men and Superhero world in general requires a significant suspension of disbelief to make the characters work. Doesn't it ever seem odd that each individual Superhero created is exceptionally unique? For example, The Beast has no genetic family tree. His mutation is singular. Scott Somers with the laser eyes is singular too. This is not normally how nature operates.<br/><br/>The first 3 movies overcome this by having some interesting plots. This turkey can be summed up one ""matter-of-fact"" scene.<br/><br/>The evil people go to get Scott Somers. Scott is in school after hours writing something like ""I will not nuke any food unless I am asked to on the chalkboard.<br/><br/>Now...Scott has powerful laser eyes when his sunglasses are off and he opens his eyes. The laser beams are so powerful that when the glasses are off his beams 3 floors of his school building are laser burned all the way through causing fire and destruction.<br/><br/>So...Scott is in school after hours and the evil people come for him.

","It is a good action movie, but that's mostly all it is, just another action movie.<br/><br/>If you switch your brain to ""off"" mode at the 20th Century Fox logo at the start of the movie you will probably enjoy it, whether you are a Marvel fan or not. But if you expect attention to detail, deep storyline with an intriguing plot and ocean deep dialog between the awesome action scenes, you will be disappointed. There are a few ""How the hell did he get there all of a sudden?!"" moments, as well as ""Why in Gods name is he doing that!?"" and ""That detail is so obviously OFF"", but the sight of Hugh Jackman roaring and tearing things apart kind of makes those moments easily forgiven.<br/><br/>On the other hand the action scenes are great, the characters even more so. The animations are really nice and some scenes are so beautiful its almost breathtaking. The cast is pretty amazing and the characters they play complement with them nicely. There probably is no one better suited to play Wolverine then Hugh Jackman, as he already did in the X-Men Trilogy (2000, 2003, 2006) perfectly. He is definitely one of the best looking super action heroes on the big screen, and not only that, he is a half decent actor too.<br/><br/>All and all I give the movie a 7/10. One grade down from 10 because of inattention to detail, another one down for the clich√© dialog and the lack of originality in story depth and another one down for failing to invoke the subjective feeling of immense and ultimate awesomeness I search for in movies. I got that from The Dark Knight and The Watchmen for example. Both films are excellent super hero movies that combine action and drama perfectly. X-Men Origins: Wolverine certainly tries its best in the drama department, but drops just a little short.<br/><br/>So if you enjoyed the X-Men Trilogy you will definitely enjoy X-Men Origins: Wolverine and if you didn't see the X-Men Trilogy yet, watch Wolverine first, you probably wont regret it."
"gav_mcf","6","1","2","11 July 2009"," Solid but sadly underwhelming X-Men prequel.
","Despite being riddled with production problems (re-shoots, negative buzz, director/producer fall-outs, leaked workprint a month before it's release) X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a lot better than you'd think and is a solid addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>The story basically builds on X-Men 2's hints towards his involvement with Weapon X that eventually leads to the loss of his memory, as well as his relationships with girlfriend Kayla Silverfox and half-brother/eventual villain Victor Creed (a.k.a. Sabretooth).<br/><br/>The film opens with a masterful sequence of the non-ageing Logan and Victor as soldiers going through various wars together and helping each other out along the way. It is a brilliant start to the film that brims with tension and it's a shame that in the overall action stakes, nothing else tops it.<br/><br/>The action then swiftly moves to their participation in the Weapon X program after being tapped by William Stryker (played by Danny Huston, following on well from Brian Cox). However, an operation turns nasty and Logan walks out, ruining his relationship with Victor in the process. The Weapon X mission sequence is also a high point and there are some new mutants who don't get near enough screen time such as Dominic Monaghan as Chris Bradley/Bolt who brings a sympathetic charm to the character and stand-out Ryan Reynolds who is charismatic, funny and cool as Wade Wilson (who later becomes Deadpool). I am thrilled by the news he is getting his own spin-off.<br/><br/>The performances overall are excellent, Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine again with total commitment and in my view it's his best performance of the series. Other deserved mentions are Lynn Collins as Kayla who is a good emotional core for the film, Daniel Henney as Stryker's hit-man David North (a.k.a. Agent Zero), Taylor Kitsch as another impossibly cool mutant Remy LeBeau (a.k.a. Gambit), Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth who gives great menace and The Black Eyed Peas Will.i.am puts in a subtle performance as teleporter John Wraith, which is light relief next to some of the more scenery chewing characters.<br/><br/>Now for the problems. Director Gavin Hood clearly has fun with characters and pacing but unfortunately he struggles with story and action; I feel the plot was too familiar and he explored areas already covered by X2. Plot holes usually don't bother me that much but there were too many present in this: how did Stryker know the adamantium bullets would erase Wolverine's memory? Why didn't he give them to super marksman Agent Zero when he was sent to hunt him down? I also had the problem that even though interesting new mutants were introduced, they didn't necessarily add to the story, an example of this is Gambit's cameo; when he meets Wolverine he just seems to start a fight with him for no reason, it almost felt like an excuse for the filmmakers to show off his abilities (which to be fair, are pretty smart) and then the next minute he's Logan's sidekick! I didn't understand his motivations.<br/><br/>Hood also struggles when it comes to action, with exception to the war opening and the Gambit fight, the action sequences are pretty average and the wirework sometimes really obvious. I don't understand why the producers didn't seek a more established action director, this is after all what is most important to the fans. I'll hand it to Hood, he has previously done some excellent dramas, but supposedly got the gig because Hugh Jackman is a 'fan' of his and put him forward. As Jackman's role as producer and a lot riding on the success of this film, I feel he should have recommended a director more accustomed to the material and someone less risky. The same problem occurred with Quantum of Solace, Daniel Craig suggested Marc Forster who was inexperienced with action and the film suffered because of it, unfortunately the same applies with Origins.<br/><br/>Overall though, Wolverine is far better than X-Men: The Last Stand and provides solid comic book entertainment. The running time also flies past (The Dark Knight and Watchmen are terrific films but this is far less bloated and stuffy than they are) and leaves the viewer wanting more. I'm glad the leaked workprint didn't damage the box office and another Wolverine film has been greenlit. I can't wait to see the story move to Japan but I just hope the producers don't interfere as much next time and it would be great to see Bryan Singer's name where it should be: on the back of the Director's chair."
"MairegChernet","8","1","2","14 June 2009"," the clich√©-ridden script is made up for by Jackman's captivating performance and the awesome action scenes.
","I can't remember a single negative thing I noticed in this film while watching it, but once I was done watching it I felt like there was some kind of void in the film. I felt as though the film was missing something, maybe it was the cheap special effects or the repetitive narration and plot build up style. Either way this film was missing something that kept it from becoming a classic. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Jackman's performance as Wolverine as well as Liev Schreiber's as Sabretooth. This movie is not near to the depth or the intelligence of X2 or other superhero films but it manages to deliver mindless entertainment worth the price of the ticket."
"merrydown","7","1","2","12 June 2009"," A good film which could have been brilliant...
","Firstly I would say that this movie covers most elements of Wolverine's background quite well. It shows where he has come from and pretty much where he is at.<br/><br/>Obviously the special effects are very good. Jackman does the same basically good job that he always does as Wolverine and the other principal players range from good to very good. The film is about the right length and the pace is fairly smooth throughout the film.<br/><br/>There are plot holes and factual errors and so on littering the film , but it should be born in mind that this is a comic-book movie. Comic books and the movies made from them aren't supposed to be super-real and factual, they are entertainment based around super powers, extraordinary circumstances and action! There are two ways in which I think this movie sells out and really doesn't do Wolverine justice. Firstly, the darkness of Wolverine's past exorcising of his rage and dark ops are all really glossed over. I disagree with many posters that he is made out to be a lifelong good-guy because the film hints that he has been part of a dubious military squad for a while before he starts to have second thoughts as to the morality of their actions. It is very gently suggested that their actions are getting worse and Wolverine reacts against this. IT ISN'T ENOUGH to just gloss over this portion of his life and hint at it though. His dark side should have been made clearer and more graphic.<br/><br/>The second way that the movie makes money rather than fulfilling its potential is the lack of graphic gore. Wolverine's whole gig is in two parts. He can be almost entirely destroyed and can regenerate from it. He has big claws that he slices people up with. What he does results in lots of blood from him and everyone that defies him. That's pretty much he most important two things two know about him.<br/><br/>To properly show off Wolverine's regeneration and capacity for violence you have to show a lot more gore and real violence. Otherwise what is the point, you are still talking about it rather than seeing it. Movies are for seeing, radio is for talking. You may as well make his claws rubber and say he only needs basic plasters rather than stitches. Selling out for a reduced certification is what the money makers behind this movie have done.<br/><br/>Saying all that, the movie is a relatively pleasant (and take that as you will) romp though Wolverine mythos. I was very pleasantly surprised after all the negative reviews I have read about it. However, if you really want to see the tone the movie should really h ave taken, watch someone playing the game of the movie. Slicing, dicing, bloody and heads rolling... That's really what we came here to see.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend watching the movie rather avoiding it, but do so knowing that you are seeing Wolverine's origins through the eyes of a censor."
"PyTom83","7","1","2","11 June 2009"," Not bad
","X-Men movies probably have the best casting for a superhero movies. For the amount they had to cast, they kept the quality up pretty well, which is disappointing since they enjoy ruining the characters.<br/><br/>Anyways, this movie isn't that bad actuality. It's got some clich√© bits, but overall it's not too shabby and was better than I was expecting, though to some extent it takes a while to get going; the scene in the intro is something that I thought was just so retarded that I initially wanted to leave the theater. The film also suffered from lazy writing. Yes, I know I am not watching an Academy Award winner, but still, wasn't anyone paying attention during the production of this film? Though, I was pretty happy with Deadpool's portrayal, especially in the beginning with Ryan Reynold's DP part.<br/><br/>I also felt that Gambit wasn't really necessary in this movie, it's like they just threw him in there for the fans. The movie had a cheesy part or two, but in the end you gotta remember that it's an action flick; some of the best have cheesy parts.<br/><br/>The finale sequence was in the movie was great, though too bad about the crappy fight and I loved how OTT cyclops powers are in this (tearing apart the school + reactor).<br/><br/>Also, this movie takes the cake for ""Most awkward screaming moments toward camera""; the movie jumps off with Wolverine Jr screaming at the camera! This is definitely not a fan of bone-claw Wolverine."
"p-stepien","7","1","2","5 June 2009"," Origins and Weapon X condensed
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is over 100 minutes of hit and miss. At times you are really at awe with the movie and how well acted it is. At other times it is cringe-worthy. End verdict definitely a lot more of the good than the bad.<br/><br/>I would have wanted something that is based a lot more on the either Origins or Barry Windsor-Smith's Weapon X. This movie however takes a bit of both, mixes it up and some random flavours. We get to know the life of James Howlett aka Logan aka Wolverine and his relationship with William Stryker and Victor Creed aka Sabretooth.<br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned Liev Schrieber is a different class of actor and steals the role, making all accusations of him not being big enough or not blonde enough seem stupid. Fortunately they connected everything that was wrong with Sabretooth in X-Men 1. This is the sadistic, murderous and immoral Creed we know from the comics. And lack of goldielocks won't change that.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is Wolverine apart from the fact, that the famous one-liner ""I'm the best at what I do..."" fell really flat. Apart from that he did a bang up job at getting in touch with the animal as well as the human within Logan.<br/><br/>I must also commend Danny Huston as William Stryker and I actually preferred this version of the character, than the one in X-Men 2.<br/><br/>Other characters are done OK, apart from surprisingly flat selling of jokes by Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Kitsch's accent being all over the place.<br/><br/>My major irks concern: a) The totally useless introduction of Gambit. Yes, the fight was cool. Yes, the character was cool. But you could feel how forced the inclusion of the character was. b) The whole boxing scene with the Blob was badly done and the comic relief just felt corny. c) Some of the plot points, like Silverfox faking her death just weren't dealt with right.<br/><br/>I would have also liked more 'bonding' between the team at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end a great movie, much better than X1 and X3, but you leave the cinema knowing that if they had basically copied i.e. Weapon X the movie could have been so much more."
"jdkraus","7","1","2","3 June 2009"," Choppy but good
","From the three X-Men films that have been made, I've shared mixed feelings towards them. I thought the first was good, the second excellent, and the last one poor. To catch up on what filmmakers have decided to do with another X-Men, I went to see it. Personally, it was not a bad film, nor was it amazing.<br/><br/>I've never read the comic books, but I found the movie's take on Wolverine's story to be very interesting, particularly with how the open titles run as Wolverine and his brother Victor Creed fight together during the different wars, beginning with the Civil War and into Vietnam. The visual effects and the work of the cinematographer made this sequence stunning, turning what would be a boring part of the film into an important aspect of it. <br/><br/>The one hour and forty-seven minute film did fly by, and the plot did feel choppy, but it managed to hold together, covering a lot about Wolverine's life as well as tying in some things that were left in the dark about the other films. I wish the movie was longer so to go more in-depth about his life, but then again, it's an action flick, not an action drama. <br/><br/>The overall performances were good. Hugh Jackman, once again, is fearless as Logan/Wolverine, and Liev Shreiber, as his brother Victor Creed is equally as stunning. Lynn Collins as Silverfox is also a nice addition. But the other supporting characters did not do much for me. They were there, but before they could be developed, they are either killed off or are not shown again. In fact, some of the supporting characters had no real point to the film, for an example, Gambit. All he does is fight in one meaningless battle against Wolverine and flies an airplane at the end. <br/><br/>And for a movie that has plenty of great CGI, the effects used on Patrick Stewart in his surprise appearance is absolutely horrible. I know he's getting up there on age, but using visual effects to make him look younger was a horrible idea. Other than these few quagmires, I found myself enjoying the film. <br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****"
"Rafacus","7","1","2","10 May 2009"," X-Men Origins: Wolverine spares no expense at blowing stuff up
","There's one thing that has always struck a good note with me about Hugh Jackman in movies¬Ö the man seems to actually care about his performance. He seems to do his homework, assumes his role and bring across a genuine performance whenever he is working. It is this type of actor that can make a mediocre movie great. When Hugh is happy, you want to laugh with him, when he is ticked you feel the intensity. It is this type of acting that made the Wolverine such a likable character in this film.<br/><br/>Bang-up special effects, blades slicing through inanimate and animate objects and enough fire and ice to make you feel as if you had just experienced Ragnarok. X-Men Origins: Wolverine spares no expense at blowing sh-t up. Shot from the angle of a gnat on the hairy back of Logan the Wolverine, we get to see why he is one ticked off dude and also why his bones are metal. Along with that, this movie shows a glimpse of how the Mutant School that Professor Xavier ran in the first three X-Men movies started.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes from a cinematography standpoint depicts Wolverine and Sabretooth in all of our popular wars, Civil War, WWI, WWII, and Vietnam. These were shot beautifully and the look of it all felt genuine. My first paragraph may mislead you into believing that Jackman was the only top performer but you will be hard pressed to fine a Sabretooth more perfect than Liev Schreiber. Intense fighting scenes, very human emotions and supernatural powers are only sobered by the dull landscape that is the home of Wolverine during the movie. There were times I wished the big man would travel around the city a bit more just to liven up the background, it made me feel as if I was watching Legends of The Fall (great movie) with mutants in it. Fans will love the slick talking Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool sans red/black getup and also Taylor Kisch's Gambit who did some very Gambit things the brief time he was on camera.<br/><br/>Of Course any more headliner mutants and this film would have fallen into the cluster f‚Äî that was the first three X-Men (X2 was awesome though) so it was kept at a minimum and all the portrayals were equally well done. Upon leaving the theater I listened to the comments of the comic book die-hards; What I got was that aside from the writers taking a few liberties with the characters well to be honest Deadpool (I liked him) they seemed genuinely pleased with the movie. For me that is enough to validate X-Men Origins: Wolverine, I mean it was solid, so check it out and make sure you sit through the credits. Oh ya and go see it on the big screen, even if you are one of the pirates who ganked the unfinished screener prior.<br/><br/>More reviews from Rafacus at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com"
"framer94","7","1","2","5 May 2009"," 7.1/10
","Unlike previous Marvel movies- Iron Man, The Hulk, Spiderman, yada yada, I enjoyed this one (as much as I did X-Men and X2) While not equal to the greatness of the first 2 X-Men movies, this one is definitely better by a mile than X-Men 3- The Last Stand.<br/><br/>My only quarm with it, is that some of the action sequences are poorly constructed in places, and the final battle is far fetched, over CGI'd, and not very believable.<br/><br/>There have not been many decent superhero movies in the 19 years. The first 2 Batman movies, the first 2 Blade movies, and the first 2 X-Men movies stand out as the only decent ones to date, in terms of original dynamic direction, production, style, and characterization; and while this movie isn't AS GOOD AS the aforementioned movies, it is pretty close. In terms of what one should expect from a decent superhero movie, this movie does just that- hell of a lot better than the lame family friendly mediocre fun of Spiderman and Iron Man. Pretty funny to see Van Wilder as a mutant...<br/><br/>My verdict: 7.1/10 - definitely worth a watch."
"Mash-the-stampede","7","1","2","4 May 2009"," X-men Origins: Wolverine-ish....
","So yet another comic-book-based film has arrived this time in the form of everyones favourite mutant, Wolverine! So once again, opinions for the film seem to differ somewhat from viewer to viewer as is normal with this type of film. The bottom line is quite simple. You can't please everyone. ESPECIALLY die-hard fans who all have their ideal version of the specific character or characters portrayed on film and of course all thoughs people that reckon if they had the huge budget supplied to them that they could in return make a better film!!! ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" is by far no masterpiece but that being said it is still a very enjoyable action movie! i.e. low on plot and big on action and cheese....but in a tasteful way.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was fine in the role of Wolverine (the cinematic version) but didn't particularly bring anything new to the role. The film flowed pretty well too with enough dialogue (though substance lacking) between the much anticipated action scenes. One of my major problems which seems to be a reacurring one of late is that they show too much in the trailers for these films, as in all the coolest parts of the action scenes I had already seen and there was very little left to surprise me! The best thing to do I guess is to stop watching trailers all together....yeah right!!!<br/><br/>The cameos of new (to live-action film) characters were good but sadly some of the cameos were either too short or pretty irrelevant! More screen time needed to go to ""Deadpool"" (the funny one not the later on one)and definitely Gambit who only seemed added in the last minute due to high demand from fans wanting him in the original trilogy! Taylor Kitch was alright as Gambit though his Cajun accent seemed to come and go which was very inconsistent.<br/><br/>I don't want to harp on about plot details etc. so I'll just say that ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" will NOT please everyone and will probably offend people who are perfectionists or are just that way inclined. It seems too many people go to movies to look for their flaws and of course end up not enjoying the movie because they never intended too!!!<br/><br/>This film is probably the closest resemblance to a live-action version of the character of ""Wolverine"" because at the end of the day we all know that if there was going to be a live-action film adaption of the comic book version of Wolverine...it would be rated - R, which means less people will see it and Hollywood won't make enough profit!<br/><br/>It's sad but true.<br/><br/>So ignore all the bad things you've heard about this film and just go and see it for yourself and make your own opinion on it as only you can decide whether you like it or not.<br/><br/>As for my opinion, it was definitely a lot better than the disappointing ""X-men 3"" but inferior to the first two films though I do think this film is a great lead-in or prologue to ""X-men 2"" and recommend watching ""X-men 2"" straight after ""X-men origins: Wolverine"" as it's almost a direct sequel: )"

","I think the superhero is coming to an end; especially if Hollywood writers can't come up with anything better than this. Once again I have stopped blaming the actors for mediocre movies and have started placing the blame where it belongs- with the writers. There seems to be no real imagination in Hollywood. I have to admit that I don't know the whole Wolverine story and frankly I don't care. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber are very credible actors in anything that they do. But the story is old and boring. The visuals were nice and of course it was loud and action packed for the fan boys. Lots of Ah!, Wow! stuff for them.

How does one severe an adamantium spinal cord to ""decapitate""?

","Whilst most of the film is entertaining and true to how we expect mutants to behave the film is spoilt by poor photography. In many scenes it is possible to see the safety harness and wires worn by the actors and the CG's of the cooling towers on Three Mile island as extremely poor. A lot of the special effects would make the viewer believe they are watching a poor animation with the actors imposed on top. It should have been so much better! It comes over as a cheaply film hardly feasible that Wolverine and his brother could be over 150 years old but the story starts with Logan and his brother being boys in 1845!"

Hahaaaa - SO funny. <br/><br/>The incessant build-up to hyperbole, with the now customary ""orchestra of impending doom"" that has permeated every film ad you see these days, was both simultaneously painful and laughable.

","*spoiler alert* I went into this film with high hopes. The potential for a great Wolverine movie, regardless of whether or not it was needed, was there. I saw it in the trailers (aside from the goofy helicopter scene). After seeing the movie, I realized how wrong I was.<br/><br/>Let me just say, it is far from the worst movie I've seen, but being a big comic book fan, this (along with Spider-Man 3) ranks among the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The biggest problem was the plot and writing. Dumb dialogue and a very condensed tale of Wolverine's beginnings made it hard to watch. Although I loved the opening sequence, it just went downhill. Too many cameos and not enough screen time for the ones who matter. I would have loved to see the entire Stryker team work together all film. To see each member interact and react to each other, a la Saving Private Ryan and Predator would have been a treat. Instead we get one mission, and Wolverine just stands around. We never get the sense that he is part of the team, or that they really are a team.<br/><br/>What doesn't work: -the cameos (there are a slew, all the way up to Gambit) -too showy (special effects are very abundant and they don't look good) -lack of explanation (why does Wolverine just walk away near the end after finding out his love is alive? Why can't Sabertooth survive the adamantium procedure? Why is there a boxing scene with Wolverine and Blob?) -<br/><br/>There are a bunch of other minor quibbles I could list, but here are some positives: -Acting is all-around good, particularly Hugh and Liev. -Opening Scene -Minor supporting characters are well portrayed (especially Deadpool)<br/><br/>Overall, It is worth watching only (and only) if you actually enjoyed X3: Last Stand and you are completely obsessed with all things wolverine. Otherwise, skip."
"StarsDown","3","2","7","9 May 2009"," A Big Middle Finger to All X-Men Fans
","How on earth can you make a Wolverine film and have no concept of his character? Logan is supposed to be an animal, impulsive, angry and ready to pick a fight. Someone who is giving into his dark urges that makes a decision to be better than he is. It is this war that he wages within himself that makes him a complex and identifiable character. He represents an extreme example of the struggle that all of us face within ourselves. This is the Logan that was built up in X-Men and X2. Logan in Origins is so far removed from that character and it is supposed to be a prequel. In the first two films Logan is shown as someone who feels pain but in Origins Logan doesn't even bleed.<br/><br/>This film just plods along with events happening without any real significance to the plot, character development or any sort of climax. Without going into any spoilers the plot is convoluted and everything in the film is rushed. Origins is devoid of anyway for the audience to connect to any of the characters or even care about what is going on. It even fails on any basic level to engage an audience as a pure popcorn action film with poorly built up and sloppily shot fight scenes. Some of the special effects look downright awful especially Wolverine's claws. All of the humor in this film misses the mark with the exception of the one scene Ryan Reynold was in. Other mutants just pop up without any build up or reason. Deadpool was completely ruined by the end and Gambit is in only two scenes. They did do a better job with the character design for Sabertooth than the previous films and Liev Schreiber did an admiral job trying to portray him, but he isn't given much to go on. For all it's flaws if they had done a decent job portraying Wolverine right Origins could have been at least enjoyed but it fails on every level possible. Gavin Hood made a film that is a big middle finger to all X-Men fans and finds a way to further drag down the franchise."

Gambit: OK I didn't actually mind the boy that played Gambit though he wouldn't have been my first choice and the character could have been wrote better Wraith: Will.i.am Apart from all these flaws the film was a bit poor and in some scenes like when wolverine was in the bathroom and is looking at his new claws the cgi doesn't even look like its meant to be real.<br/><br/>Overall I was extremely disappointed, i had refused to watch any pilot of it saying no no i want to go to the cinema its got deadpool man, now i wish i hadn't bothered.

"DarkVulcan29","7","2","7","2 May 2009"," Not as good as X2 and X3, but at least better then X1.
","I didn't like the first X-Men(2000), because when I look at it, it appears to be on such a low budget, the only reason it worked because of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, his portrayal as the charming rebel pretty much made the picture. In 2003, X-Men 2 came out, and it suppressed more then what part 1 ever could, and in 2006 X-Men 3:The last Stand came out, it did alright but not quite as good has part 2 did. In all those it was Wolverine that pretty much made each film. Those films would have been nothing without him. I had a feeling it would be a matter of time, he would get his own movie.<br/><br/>This is another prequel, it shows Wolverine life before he joined the X-Men. This movie had incredible action, and a great performances by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed. But this movie suffers from one serious flaw. It was too fast paced, like on speed dial. I felt we didn't get enough time to get know most of the characters, some just come and go pretty fast, some talents in this film are just so unused. But the awesome action makes up for it.<br/><br/>Will there be a sequel? Only time will tell. But I'll tell you this much it kind of leaves it open for one."
"action_pack_jack","3","2","7","1 May 2009"," Definitely not worth the wait or all the hype...
","I was really hoping this was going to be the best X-Men movie of them all and I was really disappointed after seeing it. The clich√©s come one right after another and the movie bogs down very quickly.The action, while good at times, never had me on the edge of my seat like I was hoping it would. My biggest complaint comes from the choice of Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth. I've never seen a movie that he was in that was worth a damn. He was totally miscast and I think they should have recast Tyler Mane instead. I'll probably end up buying this on DVD eventually...maybe when it hits the $5 bin at Wal-Mart. Otherwise it's a waste of a time for anyone except the most dedicated and easy-to-please fan-boy or girl."
"C-Younkin","6","2","7","1 May 2009"," Jackman has claws, but the movie doesn't
","It was a lackluster and underwhelming movie year when suddenly ""Wolverine"" injected some life into it, a full month before anybody actually thought he would. A fan boy wet dream came true as the movie, in perfect quality, appeared on the internet absolutely free of charge leading to new debate over piracy and manic containment control by Twentieth Century Fox. A Fox columnist was fired, the FBI was brought in to investigate, an Australian visual effects company was implicated but nothing was ever proved. What a way to start off publicity for the clawed super hero, definitely the most charismatic of the ""X-Men"". He finally gets to show off his chops without all the extra baggage but the result is surprisingly tame and standard, both in terms of plot and action.<br/><br/>It's a prequel so were starting all the way back in 1845 with Logan as a young boy. After some complicated Daddy issues, he mistakenly kills his biological father and runs off with his brother Victor. Both know they're special, Logan with his claws and Victor with his sharp nails and fangs. They will grow up together, Hugh Jackman playing adult Logan, a.k.a Wolverine, and Liev Schreiber playing adult Victor, a.k.a Sabretooth, and stand side by side for every war from Civil to Vietnam, not aging a day in that time span. They are eventually recruited by William Stryker (Danny Huston), running a Special Forces team of mutants to do secret missions around the world. Victor sinks his teeth into it but Logan soon tires of the violence and splits to become a logger and takes up with a schoolteacher girlfriend. Just it isn't going to be that easy. Victor kills his girlfriend and Stryker tricks him into an experiment involving having his skeleton bonded with the metal, adamantium. Just what he doesn't know is that Stryker wants to harness his DNA afterwards and erase his memory. Logan manages to escape and sets out for revenge, finding that what happened to him is just the tip of Stryker's plans.<br/><br/>The execution is oddly flat. Much of the movie is based around encounters Wolverine has with characters with different special abilities. Some are very cool. I really enjoyed Deadpool, a character who can deflect bullets with his swords, and Gambit, who can manipulate kinetic energy. Sadly the screenplay by Skip Woods and David Benioff reduces these roles to brief cameos so it can shoe-horn in a lot of other unnecessary characters, campiest of all is the Blob, a Fat Bastard clone if I ever saw one. No one makes much of an impression, perhaps because their only given a few lines before being tossed into underwhelming fight sequences with a lot of aimless swinging, thrashing, clawing, hand-waving, and beating. In the entire movie there is only one action sequence that even deserves the right to be called Blockbuster and that one involves a motorcycle, some military hummers, and a helicopter. Some of the special effects are good. Wolvie showing off the claws is cool, as is Sabre-Tooths 4-legged speed but for the most part the special effects don't add much.<br/><br/>Jackman is perfect for this role though. In the ""X-Men"" movies, Wolverine has really found more of a following than any other character and all of that lays right at Hugh Jackman's feet. Wolverine fits him like a glove. He's got an awesome physique complete with rugged good looks and total grit. Another notable here is Liev Schreiber, who really finds the menace in this reckless, hot-tempered character. And Danny Huston is at his slimy best as the evil William Stryker.<br/><br/>Just ""Wolverine"" is pretty tepid and that's unfortunate. The backstory is really your average revenege flick. We don't find out a lot about what Wolverine stands for or how he got his claws in the first place. I also wondered how Wolverine ages since Jackman seems to cover 100+ years of the characters life. And what surprises me even more is that the action is a little on the lite side, being less about inspiration than about just random fights. Summer is about bringing the A-game and despite being a watchable movie with a good sense of humor and an ending that sets up the Bryan Singer X-Mens very well, it just doesn't live up to expectations, coming up short in quite a few categories."
"jaspermcc","5","2","7","1 May 2009"," as bad as the last stand
","My mistake was going to see this optimistic that it might be decent. Unfortunately the writers and director had other plans for my evening.<br/><br/>Badly written, over complicated and strewn with pointless characters (Gambit, Cyclops and Emma Frost, for example). The dialogue was bad, and the fight scenes seemed to have Wolverine and Sabretooth running, or loping, at each other on a loop.<br/><br/>Things weren't explained, or were so badly thought out as to be preposterous e.g. the marvel(!) of the adamantium injections, and Wolverine's ability to instinctively use his now unbreakable, factory fresh, beautifully shaped claws in scenarios that would have torn his arm off only minutes previously.<br/><br/>The sequence up to and including the titles I quite liked, but it was a very steep downhill from there."

","OK, first thing is I stopped reading X-Men about 20 years ago (around issue #230?) So, I can't speak for the 'accuracy' of this story. But, as a movie script..it's weak. So, I'm to believe that Wolverine and Sabertooth are related, that they both are practically immortal, and Wolverine was just FINE with war and killing until about 100 years had past? Just a bit weak to me. And it's short! 107 minutes!? This franchise has lots of fans, they'll be willing to sit through 120 or so for a better story. Normally I don't do spoilers but I have to mention the following as examples of poor writing. 1. Wolvie is sick (with the puberty/mutant change I suppose) and then he hears a shot, jumps out of bed, runs to see his dad die, freaks out, and kills the murderer; except Surprise!, it wasn't his real dad, the killer is. oops! ..say What? 2. Doesn't anyone notice how these two soldiers are fine after battles? Even though their clothes would have holes and blood? 3. Firing Squad scene - I'd much rather have their lawyer argue that since sentence was executed, they should be free. Not their fault they can't be killed. 4. Boy! the 'Team' sure has some fast jumping dudes! Oh and that rock they went in after...uhm...why not send Teleport fella in, *pop*, grab rock, *pop*, all done! 5. OK, wife's death a fake. Why? Her objective was to goad Wolvie at Sabertooth, which in turn gives him to Stryker. Fine, Stryker is a cold SOB so is Sabertooth..she's done, DO IT for real and then she's out of the equation. Besides, Wolverine's animal senses should have detected the blood that isn't her's or something. 6. That was fast! So, presto adamantium is now in him. My he moves well for someone just made quite a bit heaver, IMO. 7. Got Adamantium bullets!? He's escaped! GIVE THEM TO Agent Zero! jeeze! he can shoot like Alvin York! but no,..<br/><br/>I think that's where I pretty much lost interest. But there is quite a bit more... Oh! I did forgot to mention the Scott Summers and the How-the-heck-did-he-find-out-that-ruby-quartz-stops-his-power bit.<br/><br/>The effects are nice and I'm a fan, so It gets a small bump."

I've had people say it was amazing...No its not...<br/><br/>The action was silly and the dialogue stunk up the place...A wolverine origin should consist of one character Wolverine.

","This movie is terrible. I can say, without doubt, that anybody that is over 15 and is a comic book fan will hate this movie.<br/><br/>I grew up reading comics, and Wolverine is one of my favourite characters. Granted comics running for so long can cover a lot more but this movie went for flashes and bangs instead of any kind of storyline.<br/><br/>The opening scene contains about two minutes of the Quesada, Jemas and Jenkins graphic novel, which (in the GN) establishes Wolverines connection to Sabretooth and why he choose the name Logan. The movie just leaves out the name part and creates a horrible relationship between the two main characters. Then a 4 minute montage tells the rest of their story without adding any weight to the characters.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie seems like the screenwriters (Benioff & Woods) just wanted to add as many characters as they could without even reading profiles of the characters and their abilities. They threw in what people would have known from the other movies but even compromised on those established facts as well (having wolverine losing his memories well after the adamantium procedure rather than during)<br/><br/>The special effects were well below par. A horrible green-screen shot with a bunch of kids running to a helicopter being my personal favourite.<br/><br/>I will give credit to the casting director though... as long as they didn't insist on creating a character for Will.I.Am, who didn't do badly, but whose character wasn't needed. I'm sure all of the cast and the director would have done a fantastic job, if it weren't for this horrific script.<br/><br/>Anybody that had any control over the writing in this peace of %#!& should be punish for crimes against cinema... the penalty for such crimes should be the clockwork orange torture, and this movie on the screen."

I suppose that everyone was spoiled briefly by decent movies like Ironman and Transformers, but this is Hollywood propaganda at near-peak. The only part of the movie that I found really entertaining was the watching the professional movie reviewers trip over themselves trying to prove how intelligent they were by catching the ""Northwest Territories, Canada, 1845"" faux pas. To bad nobody noticed that they had the Army using M-4 carbines during the Viet Nam war. A heavy propaganda piece that shows no respect to any aspect of its subject matter, from the original comics to its military characters. No thanks."

Every good moment in the entire movie. The dialogue was incredibly lame (literally, limp and unable to stand on its own, I don't know how the actors got through it.) That's taking into account this is just a comic book action movie. The action could have been good, and I suppose in places was, but everything was GLARINGLY computer generated/enhanced. Sometimes it's needed (this is fantasy) but there were so many instances where a little effort in costumes, location or stuntmen would have helped add just a little realism to the movie: Wolverine's claws, that fat guy (get a suit, really), half the backgrounds, most of the fight scenes... It was WELL below the X-Men franchise's standards. The story seemed to conflict with the first three movies (I'm not a huge fan, I won't say for sure) and even if it didn't it was just so silly, I don't know what they were trying to do. Characters barely came in before they were never seen again, some I don't even know what their powers were. I didn't care about anyone. I hope they just let this franchise end, movie-wise."

","I don't know why some people rate this movie so poorly. It is as good as most other superhero movies I have seen and better than quite a lot of them. The action is spot on, the plot is exciting and engaging and there's hardly a dull moment. The acting and special effects are all great and it manages to avoid most of the cliches inherent in your typical superhero movie. Hugh Jackman puts in another great performance as the eponymous hero and Liev Schrieber is a very welcome return as Sabretooth. The baddies are suitably bad and the goodies are, well, conflicted. The only really negative thing I can say about this movie is that, as an origin story, it doesn't really work. That's not the fault of this movie though. As a stand-alone work it's just fine. No, the problem is that these movies - especially the X-Men franchise - have been retconned so often that the origin of Wolverine you see portrayed here is highly unlikely to have much resemblance to the origin that is referenced in future movies. That's sad for the die-hard fans. Don't let it stop you enjoying this movie though. It is a treat."
"TheMovieDoctorful","8","1","3","21 June 2019"," Silly, But Relentlessly Entertaining
","I don't even feel guilty loving this one. In fact, I'd actually argue that it's the most underrated X-Men film by a landslide. That's not to say that it's great, it has some significant script problems especially in regards to structure and a story that often gets unfocused and messy to put it kindly. Studio interference did a real number on Origins: Wolverine (Do I even really talk about what this film did to Deadpool?) and there are points where it gets even too stupid for its relatively low ambitions. It's also pretty visually ugly to look at (Though no more so than half the MCU.)<br/><br/>That being said, there's still a lot to enjoy here for me. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a fun, silly throwback to cheesy 80s action films much in the same manner that the similarly maligned Doom was and, when viewed under this lens, a lot of its more goofy moments make sense. It's less interested in following the (misguided) approach at social commentary the previous movies fumbled around with that being its own unique vision; a tribute to testosterone-infused cheesefests like Commando or Cobra. It's the kind of movie where the hero fights a helicopter before slowly walking away from an explosion without looking. Where characters say lines like ""I'm gonna cut your goddamn head off"" and ""Nobody kills you but me"" with the straightest of tough guy stares.<br/><br/>It's silly.<br/><br/>It's deeply silly.<br/><br/>But you know what? That's fine.<br/><br/>After 3 movies of unintentionally offensive and brutally tone deaf attempts to exploit real life Civil Rights movements for laughable attempts at allegory, I'll take a big, dumb action movie that embraces its dumbness instead of masquerading as something it's not. And dumb as they are, those action scenes have some spectacle. They have some weight and creativity to them. Say what you want, but not many writers in Hollywood today would put a scene in their action movie where the hero slices a steel ladder to bits while his enemy is climbing it or where he cuts through a lab naked before jumping into a waterfall.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the film doesn't have anything to bite on outside of its over-the-top cheesiness. Liev Schrieber's Sabretooth is one of the best acting performances in a superhero movie to date, bringing depth and menace to a character relegated to mere dumb brute status in previous films. Victor Creed has always been one of my favorite mutants in Marvel and he's done absolutely perfectly here. His relationship with Wolverine is probably one of the most complex and interesting in any of the X-Men movies and Schrieber balances his conflicted jealousy and disgust for Logan wonderfully. Cheesy nature of the film aside, Schrieber is both frightening and surprisingly three-dimensional in his portrayal of Wolverine's spiteful, sadistic and cunning tormentor. It's everything I could have wanted out of a portrayal of one of my favorite supervillains.<br/><br/>It's weird thinking of this film as the only one of the original 4 X-Men movies to give Logan a strong character arc, but it really is. It's interesting to see a character renown for his status as a lone wolf slowly lose his naivety and trust in others until he literally becomes nothing but a shell of anger and rage, no identity left but his anger and propensity for violence. I do think there is some degree of depth there and, clunky as the journey is, Indo think it remains intact through the end product.<br/><br/>I'll even go on record and say I prefer Danny Hutson's Stryker to Brian Cox's. Is it accurate to the comics? No. Not even a little. Is it an enjoyably over-the-top and insanely fun mad scientist take on the character that totally fits the insane 80s action tone the film is going for? Is it something I'll take over Bryan Singer's laughable oversimplification of what real world political bigots act like? Yes and Hell yes.<br/><br/>You know what? I'll go even farther. I like Will.I.Am as John Wraith in this film. Once you get over the fact that he's famous for being the lead singer in a terrible R&B band, he actually pretty accurately captures the charisma and wisecracking sense of humor of Wraith from the comics. His chemistry with Jackman is off the charts too.<br/><br/>So those are my thoughts on Origins: Wolverine. It's an entertainingly overblown, often funny 80s action film that for some reason was released in 2008 with some strong character arcs and mind blowing action sequences.<br/><br/>And at least, at LEAST, it didn't try and somehow tie the mutant fight for Civil Rights to the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br/><br/>...I can't believe I actually had to say that."

"fernandoschiavi","7","1","3","1 October 2016"," Finally, the origins of Marvel's most famous mutant, Wolverine
","Finally comes to the big screen the film that explains the origins of Marvel's most famous mutant, Wolverine. Despite the very origins of the character as has been said, some ""liberties"" were taken unnecessary in this adaptation that can bother the most ardent fans. The film begins in 1845, showing the boys James Logan and Victor Creed, who sealed a pact of friendship and that would always be together. Then comes one of the best openings of recent years and one of the few writers that actually make the viewer think a bit to have the skills to realize the two boys as mutants through several wars throughout the history of mankind serving their country. Ali realized their skills when they are targeted by bullets in the Civil War, the World Wars, and regenerating rapidly and also showing the differences in behavior of the two. The opening is very well edited, well directed with phenomenal transitions from war to another, magnificently displayed, and the soundtrack is also great and pure adrenaline.<br/><br/>Interestingly showing Wolverine's mysterious past with the revelation of the true character name, your entry to the ""Weapon X program"" and the experiment that is submitted, we find that he is actually a character centenary due to slow aging, as had been suspected in the first X-Men movie, where Jena Grey commented that it could be even older than Professor Xavier and would be unable to determine its true age. The part of ""Alpha Flight"" was omitted but the fact that he was helped by a couple who helped again to behave as a human was maintained and snapped in the plot. It is important in this network also his ""marriage"" to one of his loves, Kayla Silverfox, the ""Silver Fox"" and relation of two living in a cabin in a remote community in Canada, and shows including Sabretooth relationship with her and Logan, though his accelerated healing factor of comics was replaced in the film by the ability to control the minds of the people it touches, because the story presented. The main elements and events related to the origin of Wolverine were placed in the film, but with some adjustments, some required and others not Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston and the beautiful Lynn Collins are even great highlights. Jackson once again proves that no one better than him to play Wolverine. Every movie and here he excels more than the other side can explore a greater animal character. <br/><br/>This plot has good action scenes and they are the trump card of the film, as the fight scene in the midst of bike chase by helicopter, the scene with skid grip is amazing, following the death of the living room mansion with the plan sequence early in the film, the insertion of the body metal Logan, the fight scenes between Wolverine and Deadpool and between Wolverine and Sabretooth especially in the final scenes. Some characters from the character's origin was indispensable in the film as William Stryker and Sabretooth, but the film seems to suffer the same error of X-Men-The Last Stand which shows an excess endless mutants. Gambit and Deadpool interesting villain could be better exploited. Scott Summers, Cyclops, appears still young, and even uses his powers recently discovered, but it is there only to please the fans, as well as their participation is unnecessary, as well as the presence of John Wraith, Dukes and Bradley. Since the focus here is on Wolverine, this excess of other mutants is an error in the script.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the script by David Benioff and Skip Woods is simple and tries to hold a strong pace and clog the screen stunt at the expense of a deeper story, more elaborate and even more obscure. This could also be better worked but the concern was to create an action movie, and just action. The final sequence that goes on top of a plant that ends up being destroyed, but gives an impression of artificiality that scene, especially when Deadpool falls and the rays will ""slicing"" where they are. The fall of the characters from above as if they had sprung from a skateboard was also pretty hard to swallow, but you can accept that scenes ""forced"" is not lacking in the plot. The makeup helps in some scenes but in others is really bad in makeup as the character Fred Dukes. Good special effects are even better quality, editing Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill and soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams (The Chronicles of Narnia-The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)), which although repetitive work well in key scenes with the opening credits.<br/><br/>Gavin Hood could explore a darker film with a plot and better developed. He used violence but rather to maintain censorship hardly uses low blood scene. Many people say that the excess characters left confused film. Excess hampered the development issue, but not on your understanding. With a budget of $ 150 million, Hood delivered a conventional movie, full of clich√©s of the genre action and phrases, without adding much to the genre. Your goal here was basically trying to create memorable scenes action. It's a good action movie, which explains much of the main character but in most skilled hands could present a result even grander. Anyway, movie popcorn first! Oh, and tip: do not miss an extra scene after the end credits."

","This is the worst movie in the X-Men franchise. Now we do see in this movie all the origins of Wolverine like he was born in the 19th century and has lived on since then and then we see him get his metal claws. Still the rest of the plot of this movie isn't very good and the guy who played Gambit in this didn't do a very good job. We also see Blob in this but he wasn't even working for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in this. Also what's the idea of having Deadpool in this when his mouth is sewed completely shut? Good thing Deadpool is a lot better in his own movie then he was in this piece of crap. Also Deadpool has a healing factor too and he can regenerate limbs as well and we haven't seen Wolverine do that. Anyway this movie is just plain horrible. One of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. This movie doesn't deserve a lot of credit."
"DanielRobertRoss","2","1","3","15 February 2016"," The one with the rubbish Deadpool
","After watching this years' Deadpool, the movie that got everything right, I thought I should review the film that came out back in 2009 that go so much wrong. The annoying thing is that the film starts off so promisingly, with a fantastic montage of Wolverine and Sabertooth fighting their way from the American Civil War to WW2 to Vietnam. Any one of those wars would have made for a fantastic movie on it's own, but instead we get a weak mutant team up in what was meant to be a solo adventure. This film is supposed to take place around 20 years before the events of X2: X-Men United (Where fifty year old actor Brian Cox was Stryker) and yet you have Danny Huston, an actor in his late forties when the film was made, playing the part of William Stryker. It just confuses me why you would pick an actor like Huston, Brian Singer did it way better by casting a young actor (Josh Helman) as Stryker in his early twenties in the excellent X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). And where's the blood? How many times does Wolverine stab Sabertooth in close up camera shots, showing no blood? Is Sabertooth filled with the same stuffing that Winnie the Pooh is filled with? I know it's a PG film, but still, c'mon guys... Unnecessary cameos come thick and fast too, from Black Eyed Peas members (Will.i.am, really?) to hobbits (Dominic Monaghan is completely wasted in a thankless cameo with three lines of dialogue). Plus a pointless Cyclops cameo. The only winner is Taylor Kitsch as Gambit, but even he is given little more to do than drop Wolverine off from a plane. Ryan Reynolds isn't to blame for this Deadpool-in-name-only portrayal here, it's the writers for this abomination. Happily with this years' Deadpool movie, all is forgiven. I hated Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth, he plays him like a reject from the Matrix sequels, like a goth with claws. Where was Tyler Mane from the first X-Men movie? I know he was a wrestler, but I thought he was great in the first one, and he was memorable as a Greek warrior in Troy (2004). The unnecessary recasting only adds to the confusion. <br/><br/>But the casting is only one of the problems. This movie has no idea what time it's events take place. it's supposedly the late 70s (It's never stated when the first X-Men film takes place, but the comic book adaptation of the first movie makes references to Bill Clinton, so this puts Origins in the late 70s, early 80s), but the computer readouts at Stryker's HQ and attack helicopters weren't around for another 15 years. And the CGI varies from passable to embarrassing. Wolverine's claws are really bad, considering the film's high budget. And the de-aged Patrick Stewart cameo in front of terrible blue screen? Urgh. Not to mention that after X-Men First Class, old Xavier walking now makes no sense. And the set where Wolverine gets his adamantuim looks nothing like the creepy lab that we saw in Logan's nightmares in X2, where where the people being killed? Agent Zero shoots him once, then he claws his way out of the base and runs off starkers to Ma and Pa Kent. Weak. The action scenes are forgettable too, with the one exception of the helicopter scene, but apart from that, pretty bog standard stuff.<br/><br/>I group this film along with X-Men: The Last Stand as the two X-Men films Brian Singer had nothing to do with and therefore do not count as official films. The events of Last Stand were happily given retroactive continuity due to Wolverine's time-traveling in X-Men: DOFP and this film can be just as easily forgotten due to both Stryker and Deadpool being done properly by Brian Singer and Tim Miller."
"noahhaye","1","1","3","17 December 2014"," It's not bad. It's worse
","The amount of sheer awfulness and mediocrity in this film simply cannot be described in words.<br/><br/>We already got dumped on with Brett Ratner's incredibly god-awful X-Men: The Last Stand which shocked us on how low it went and how amazing the first and second X-Men can't hold a candle to it. Now we have this, the story that neuters Wolverine. Honestly, this is one of my favorite movie franchises, but this is just a disaster on epic proportions.<br/><br/>Why? Well, for one, it has more inaccuracies than The Dark Knight, and I'm not saying that TDK was a bad film at all, but you have to admit, you did ask yourself how the Tumbler got onto that 8th floor in the garage at the beginning. This one has someone looking down the viewfinder of a tank, but really it's the inside of the tank barrel.<br/><br/>Second, it answers questions no one could care less about or gives us inadequate answers. For one, we're not buying that James got his claws through trauma. If so, I would've gotten claws from seeing all the 9/11 photos. Another question they answered was where he got his name. See, I always thought that he got his name from the actual animal, but nope. It's from some dumb story about the moon and Trickster told by his girlfriend, Silverfox, who was just another ""bottom of the barrel"" character.<br/><br/>Third, the special effects are just disastrous. This movie doesn't have to be made by the same people who made Tron Legacy or Star Wars, but come on. Why change Patrick Stewart's face to have an incredibly ugly CG-i botox makeover? <br/><br/>Fourth, Dead pool. Just search up Dead pool in your search engine. Now add ""x-men origins"" to the end of that. See what I mean? <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is unworthy of the franchise and kicked it while it was down, until the 2011 miracle that was First Class."
"GeorgeRoots","3","1","3","27 September 2014"," As A Wolverine Fan, What A Kick In The Nuts This Was
","In a nutshell, ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" butchered everything that the true origin had explained in the comic books. But I'm all for taking apart and embellishing certain elements for the sake of a cinematic adaptation.<br/><br/>But just ""because"", I feel the need to say this: 1. Wolverine & Sabertooth were never brothers, and this really doesn't even add that much to the story they tell. 2. ""Weapon X"" only ever consisted of Wolverine, Dead-Pool, Omega-Red & Sabertooth. The pointless additions of Will.I.Am, and ""The Blob"" (For some reason they show him skinny which never was the case, hence the name) added nothing in the scenes they were all together in. And finally, 3. Is the pointless addition of characters such as Gambit, Emma Frost, and Cyclops who don't belong in this story and again did nothing while on screen.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman I will admit is still fantastic in the lead role, and definitely stands out as the superior actor of all this mess. I usually love Liev Schreiber, but his character really needed development and then I might of actually cared for what they were trying to portray. The choreography is actually really good in these fight scenes, and with martial artist Scott Adkins in the finale make for some wonderfully unique moments. But aside from those small good aspects, everyone else is horrible. There the same villain stereotypes we have seen in previous instalments, and none of them manage to pull it off as well.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: A hit & miss action flick that mostly misses. It's bland fun, but definitely not one of my recommendations. I just cannot believe that Gavin Hood, the man responsible for the fantastic foreign language picture ""Tsotsi"" (2005), was responsible for this. 3/10."
"veensepeper","4","1","3","16 June 2014"," The worst of the bunch... 'nuff said
","The X-movies have some genuine gems. There is no debate in X2 or Days of Future Past being awesome films. But X-Men Origins: Wolverine is lacking. Apart from explosions, it has nothing to offer.<br/><br/>The plot - if you can call it one - is incoherent and far fetched. It's supposed to shed new light on how Wolverine got both his adamantium claws as well as his amnesia. Not wanting to go into spoiler territory, I can only say that X2 delivered it already and whatever extra was brought to the table made it more confusing and convoluted.<br/><br/>While the original X-trilogy were ensemble movies, I feel that the creators of XO:W were shy to move away from that, but didn't know how to handle that into a flick that's just about one guy. It resulted in a chain of: ""Here's a character. Now he's dead. Here's another character. Now he's dead, too"", going on for the entirety of the movie.<br/><br/>In the process, they butchered Deadpool, a beloved Marvel character, into something that doesn't even remotely resemble his comic counterpart. Although Ryan Reynolds was the perfect cast-pick to play him, the movie decided to literally have his mouth sown shut.<br/><br/>One redeeming quality in the movie was Liev Schreiber's portrayal of Victor Creed, a.k.a. Sabretooth. He made him the menacing sadist bully he's supposed to be.

","Besides the cast this one is a miss when it comes to superhero movies or anti-hero movies.

Which is composed of Hugh Jackman who is probably only the perfect one to ever play Wolverine. Liev Schreiber is alright as sabretooth, Lieve basically plays sabretooth in a sophisticated and yet savage and sinister way if there is such a thing or person. And Ryan Reynolds is pretty good as the merc with the mouth Deadpool or in this for the most part Wade Wilson. And Taylor Kitsch is decent as Gambit but maybe just because of the appearance wise. But besides the casting this is just a forgettable popcorn flick that doesn't connect well with the comics or the previous X-Men movies. Just do yourself a favor and just play the video game that is based off this movie, it surpasses this movie in just every way including the story.

"zurnd","8","1","3","4 March 2013"," I Don't Think It's Dreadful
","Oh boy, now we get to the X-flick many seem to spit upon. X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a spin off and a prequel to the previous three films of the series, and while it's not my favorite of the series, it still has it's ups as well as downs. I'm going to come right out and say that I enjoyed this one a bit more than I did X-Men: The Last Stand. Many of the problems I had with The Last Stand I didn't have with this film, and the overall tone and feeling of this spin off was a bit more satisfying than the one in the previous film. But that doesn't mean the film is flawless, for there are many flaws present in the film that I will touch upon as my review progresses. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I liked X2 so much is because we got a brief glimpse of Wolverine's backstory, which has been shrouded in obscurity since X1. In this film, we see his origins head on, and I think it's my favorite aspect out of the entire film. Seeing Wolverine and his stepbrother Victor aka Sabretooth fight throughout all the major World Wars, it really shows why the two of them are as angry as we know them as. Seeing Wolverine get injected with blazing hot adamantium, it really puts gas in your stomach and you can almost feel the unbearable pain Wolvy had to endure during that dreadful procedure. And seeing Wolverine get his memories wiped away with an adamantium bullet, it tied all the loose ends and explained the very reason why he didn't know who he was in the previous three films. After all, the entire point of a prequel is to explain why things are the way they are in the films that came before. Why do you think the Star Wars prequels are caked with rich, yet complex stories? Because they have a lot of questions to answer. <br/><br/>The acting, like in the previous three films, is very wooden at times, but I will say that it has improved drastically, especially with Ryan Reynolds in the film's ranks. He is spot on as Deadpool, and although he would later go on to play Hal Jordan in the Green Lantern movie, he seems to embody Wade Wilson perfectly. It's too bad that they had to turn him into a mouthless, silent drone with adamantium blades protruding from his wrists. They might as well have brought in Baraka from Mortal Kombat. It wouldn't have made much sense, but at least they wouldn't have butchered the trademarks of a beloved comic book character. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is brilliant as always, and Liev Schreiber was pretty cool as Sabretooth, although his appearance is different than the one in X1, thus creating an unresolved plothole. Maybe Sabretooth had some plastic surgery before X1 that gave him blonde hair and black eyes. Maybe it's a different Sabretooth. Who knows? <br/><br/>There are many other mutants present in the film, but with so many characters, we run into the same problem we had with X3. Some characters are killed off anti-climatically, others don't get enough screen time or development. I did like Will.i.am as the teleporting mutant John Wraith, portraying him as a wise cracking, sarcastic cowboy like character. But he surely bites the dust very quickly and his character doesn't seem to have that much dimension beside his snarky attitude. Taylor Kitsch was perfect for the role of Gambit, but his appearance in the film was limited to only a few scenes. And Danny Huston's take on William Stryker was just not on par with Bryan Cox's portrayal of the character in X2, as Huston portrayed Stryker as a pathetic, cowardly adversary rather than a cunning, scheming opposer. That doesn't mean all the casting is bad, for Lynn Collins was triumphant as Wolvy's love interest Kayla Silverfox and Tim Pocock was decent as young Scott Summers/Cyclops, helping the mutants escape Stryker's lab and get recruited by Charles Xavier in one of Patrick Stewart's finest cameos. <br/><br/>One of the film's prominent highlights is the action. Though it's not on par with the action of X2, it still packs a punch and I think the fight between Baraka Deadpool, Wolverine and Sabretooth towards the end was one of the saga's best fights. I also must point out that the effects have improved very much since the first X-Men film, although, as many have pointed out, Wolverine's metal claws look very computer animated at times, especially in the scene where he extends his claws in front of the bathroom mirror. However, the effects do shine in the scenes where Cyclops shoots his optic blasts or when Emma Frost activates her diamond skin. And when John Wraith and Drone Deadpool teleport, you get a brief glimpse of their skeleton as they teleport away. <br/><br/>So as you can see, there are many things I enjoy about X-Men Origins: Wolverine and as I said before, I think this one is a tad better than The Last Stand. Of course, we all have our different opinions, and I think that, for a prequel to one of the highest grossing superhero series of all time, Wolverine did a fairly good job. From what I understand, a sequel is on the way this summer. Let's hope the filmmakers are able to capture the same magic this film was able to bring forward."
"elshikh4","Null","1","3","13 December 2011"," A deliberately bad car !
","The opening credits sequence of this movie is clever. Painful to know that it was the first and last clever thing around.<br/><br/>First things first; we have 2 brothers. Everyone of them is half human, half wolf and immortal. So how come is that? What is the significance of the first scene? What it did say about the relationships of the 2 brothers, their mother and their father?! After that dull scene, let the party of dullness begin!<br/><br/>The movie enjoys presenting characters, just to kill them off 2 scenes after. For little instance, the old man and his wife from the farm are about to speak then PAAM PAAM! For bigger instance, the movie's long list of now-there then-where superheroes. Given that we're in a superhero movie, where you go to have a good time with characters that have supernatural powers, then this is more like what the disappointing superhero movie is all about!<br/><br/>The main characters didn't have better fate either. Stryker is deprived of any magic as an evil man. Look at the way he appears out of the blue, in every scene, to have a laugh (the weirdest one is the one at Scott's school). To have even louder laugh, see him ordering one of his henchmen to kill Wolverine, right after he made him totally indestructible. Not only this, he didn't hand over that killer Wolverine's sole destroyer: the Adamantium bullets! Furthermore, Stryker's son is mentioned, however nothing is really said about him, or his daddy's tragedy with him, so everyone who didn't watch (X-Men 2 - 2003) will never understand ANYTHING!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the idiot points are plenty. And it's lamentable of course for any movie, but as for an X-Men movie, it's super lamentable. For instance: if the point was faking the death of Logan's wife, dragging him to the lap, injecting him with Adamantium, then erasing his memory, so why not erasing his memory FROM THE VERY START?!!! If one bullet of Adamantium can kill Wolverine, why unleashing the Frankenstein-ish Weapon X on him first?! If, again, one bullet of Adamantium can kill Wolverine, how come that 5 of them only confused his memories?!<br/><br/>Generally, that third act is unforgettably idiot chain of events: The whole surprise of the wife being alive, and having a sister, was melodramatic, forced and superfluous. That wife's revenge out of Stryker is so funny; pushing him to walk till his foots bleed, knowing that we're in a small island already! From where did Professor X know about the mutants? And isn't his short appearance is recycled, obviously, from his first encounter with Wolverine from (X-Men), with the same dialogue of ""I can read your mind"" yet spoken to Scott this time?!! Then, Logan's wife has a supernatural power, and he didn't notice?! Wolverine climbs the giant cooling tower to escape from Weapon X?! Apparently how stupid Wolverine, rather all the movie, is exactly!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman looks pretty angry in every shot (naturally, since he must have read that script!). He was so serious in a load of nonsense, which is ironic and sad. To add more irony and sadness, I knew lately that he produced it too! Liev Schreiber can't be his character. They needed someone with Jack Nickelson evil touch, not a shadow of that. Danny Huston as Stryker doesn't hold a candle to the great, first Stryker, Brian Cox; who was actually interested in reprising his role from (X-Men 2), but Huston was just cheaper! The rest, as you must have watched, were pure cameos.<br/><br/>David Benioff and Skip Woods wrote it. Rarely when they make something I love, or in other words: don't HATE! Simply the first wrote before (Troy - 2004), and (Stay - 2005), and the second alone wrote (Swordfish - 2001) and (Hitman - 2007). As you see, they are both masters of fatuous, yet noisy enough, masterpieces (should I say bombs better?!). Save the surprise of Victor Creed as someone who works for Stryker, I can't find one worthy-defending point in their script. That script made the movie uncreative and lost. It uses pages of stories that we don't know, fills itself with stupidities, then makes a third act of tacky B movie, with kind of loose endings to allow a possible sequel; which's a foolish ambition considering the case.<br/><br/>Director Gavin Hood makes average action with always long shot to embody a catchy moment. But the editing couldn't join his work in beautiful way, just snappy unfair pace as if it's a trailer, plus the not too huge budget was there. So, eventually, I was watching a chopped off and poor imitation of (X-Men) movies. Therefore, it can't be compared to the series' previous movies, maybe to a movie like (Elektra - 2005), where it even loses to the coherence of (Elektra)!<br/><br/>(X-Men Origins: Wolverine) is murdered by rushed script and directing; which became a usual crime in Hollywood of today. Humphrey Bogart said once: ""The industry hurts itself by making so many lousy movies, as if General Motors deliberately put out a bad car."" Well, here's one for you!"
"Eternality","7","1","3","3 June 2011"," X-Men Origins: Wolverine defies low expectations and critical disdain and will reward viewers who expect nothing less than an action spectacle.
","Another year, another superhero origin film. Seven years ago, it was Sam Raimi's Spiderman. Four years ago, it was Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. Last year it was Jon Favreau's Iron Man. Now add X-Men Origins: Wolverine to the fray. The director is Gavin Hood, the Oscar-winning director of Tsoti (2005), a powerful South African drama centering on a hoodlum's search for redemption under an oppressive society and amidst the crushing weight of poverty. With his newest project, he tackles a new and different face to filmmaking, a switch from independent cinema to mainstream commercialism. <br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine stars Hugh Jackman as John Logan a.k.a Wolverine for the fourth time after Bryan Singer's two excellent features and a disappointing Brett Ratner sequel. I do not rate the Australian very highly as an actor as he has a limit to his acting range. However, he very much nails his character here in a display of ferocious power and boundless energy. In addition, Jackman has a very strong supporting actor in Liev Schreiber, who plays Victor Creed a.k.a Sabretooth (Logan's close ally-turned-nemesis) with equal badass-ness. In recent years, Schreiber (Defiance, The Painted Veil) has established himself to be an excellent screen presence in numerous multi-faceted roles that are at the very least compelling. <br/><br/>There is some controversy over who actually helmed the action sequences. Richard Donner (Superman, Lethal Weapon), one the film's executive producers says that he has a hand in many of them. But Hood dismisses this since he is credited as the director of the film. Whatever the issue, it is not important because the film features solid action and generally entertains for the bulk of its length as a result of rapid pacing and some remarkable visual effects. An example is a standout sequence following Wolverine's narrow escape from a barn in a retro motorcycle, having his hands or metallic claws full dealing with enemy Hummers and a chopper with loads of ammunition. <br/><br/>There are flaws to the narrative; there is a sense of predictability as to how situations will evolve and how the fates of some characters will ensue. As a consolation for fans, not all is resolved at the end of the film and this leaves room for a sequel or another X-Men origin movie. X- Men Origins: Wolverine defies low expectations and critical disdain and will reward viewers who expect nothing less than an action spectacle. Those who demand more on their plates will leave the theaters with not as wide a smile as the rest. <br/><br/>GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>all rights reserved."

The things that i said here is the only good things I can really say about this film.<br/><br/>I will not waste my time talking about the bad in this movie because there was too much of it.

"Timstuff","1","1","3","29 May 2010"," The bastard child of the X-Men franchise
","This movie was a mess. I don't read the X-Men comics so I don't really know how accurate it was, but it had almost no continuity with the previous 3 movies whatsoever. The special effects were crappy and unfinished looking (and no, I am NOT talking about the leaked workprint-- the ""finished"" effects were not much better), the acting was at times laughable, and the story was a jumbled mess. The whole thing was written around a revolving door of extended cameos to the point where it felt like a friggin' muppet movie. Seriously, why is Wolverine having a boxing match with this big fat guy? WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PLOT!? And also, there was the stupid ""love story"" with Wolverine and that Native American chick (who by the way, looks nothing at all like that blond WASP disco ball girl who is supposed be her ""sister""). Rather than show us WHY Logan loves this woman so much, they just jump from Logan leaving the army to him living with this chick who he supposedly is in love with. This is a such a violation of the ""show don't tell"" rule of cinema that it's not even funny. He loves this woman just because. They don't need to show us WHY they love each other, they just do because the writers needed it.<br/><br/>And while I do not read the X-Men comics, I am familiar with the character of Deadpool and I can certainly understand why people felt like his character was so bastardized in this movie. Ryan Reynolds did a good job portraying Wade Wilson (one of the only enjoyable parts of the movie), but that's all we ever saw of him. ""Weapon 11"" was quite possibly the dumbest most contrived end-movie-boss battle I've seen in the last 10 years (and yes, I'm well aware of how video-game-like that sounds, because it's intentional). Really, was that the best that Tom Rothman and his cronies could come up with? A mutant who has a bunch of other mutants' powers? Good grief.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think we can safely assume that this movie was written by a focus panel of 14 year old boys. The only thing missing is a bunch of bikini clad women and fart jokes (although the fat boxer guy kind of filled the bodily humor niche), because this movie is nothing but moronic drivel that seems like something that a bunch of testosterone-dizzy children pumped full of caffeine would come up with. As stupid as Transformers 2 was, the one summer blockbuster last year that managed to eclipse it was Wolverine. As schlocky as TF2's script was, Wolverine's was even worse. It's merely an unending stream of video game battles shoehorned into a stupid ""revenge"" story. No wonder the video game ended up being superior to the film it was based on."

We are going to expect action, and what did this movie gave us? Entertaining action! The storyline is always important in a movie, but we can't forget the genre in this movie, and it is the genre who decides what we are going to expect from that movie.<br/><br/>But this movie has a storyline that actually works. The story line can't be so bad that we forget what kind of movie it is!? I absolutely do not think so. The storyline makes suddenly change-twists sometimes because it all is about Logan lose his look at the reality and how he lose the things that is most important to him, because of that he became the cruel killer he is ""today"".<br/><br/>A movie can be good in many ways, one of them is when a movie have a great storyline. Another way is when a movie makes you laugh all the time. This movie entertains you with action, but thats not all the movie gives us. The actor (Hugh Jackman) is acting very good in this movie, and that is one of the most important things in a movie, specially in a Drama when the storyline is all that the movie have to entertain the audience.<br/><br/>To all the storyline-freaks, believe it or not but I will give this movie a nine because of the special effects and action scenes that I enjoyed, the good acting from Hugh Jackman and a story that I think fits pretty good with the movie."

","Overall, Gavin Hood gave it mediocre direction...I'd say on par with McG's Terminator Salvation and in some ways better than Bryan Singer's take on it all. What can I say, Jackman owns the character in it's entirety and the introduction of Reynold's as Deadpool made it all the more worth it despite some drastically minute screen time. The only major flaw, because the acting wasn't all that great (I never expected it to be) was casting Taylor Kitsch as Remy LaBeau/Gambit. I find it hard to believe that he pulled off the task of bringing Jim Le and Chris Claremont's version to life, especially since it was the first time the character graced the big screen. Horrible Cajun accent and despite my heterosexuality, I find it hard to believe that this guy possesses the famed charm Remy had on women. Danny Houston on the other hand worked nicely."

If you ask me he had not cared about expectations so much, wanted a very good movie of his own. I thought to myself like we would watch a disappointing X-Men movie, because there were no reason to make a difference, make somethings different, because all the previous movies are successful (to me) This is an almost light movie, a light X-Men movie. Or should I say shallow, even if the previous ones were not real deep, a character study or something? Tyler Mane as Sabretooth was great to me, seems the best choice, but I don't know why, but as I read, many people disappointed. This is really funny. What was wrong with him? He was a harsh Sabretooth and was looking amazing. I did not Liev Schreiber honestly, so I disappointed with this one. Despite I am a big X-Men fan, I had not been aware of Deadpool, so after watching this movie, I searched him on the internet and very impressed. However, I did not the character in the movie, he was like the brother of Hannibal King or even like the same person. A normal dressed guy who has a sword. In the movie, he was an uninspiring (dull) character. Thus, he does not look like a X-Men member. There are also some other characters which are just showy! The Asian guy who shoots very fast or the ridiculous Mutant X. It was just a terrible idea and it ruins the whole movie and absorbs the entertainment. Brian Cox was great as Stryker, but as as the result of the tendency of reconstruction, we 'lost' him. Visual effects especially in the scenes which Sabretooth leaps are very cheesy. Blob is a character who we should not see in a (good) X-Men movie, this character makes the movie an ordinary entertainment. And Gambit. Probably my favorite character, or one of them. I had known that in any adaptation, this character would be as disappointing as it can be. In the previous movies, they did not even put him. This shows that they don't care about him, so they did not try to be very careful of course. In the movie, he is a character created in a scratchy way. Besides, his screen time is so less like Two Face in The Dark Knight. In fact more short! The actor was not a good choice, his powers were exaggerating, his appearance was 'normal', briefly, a very interesting character turns into an ordinary character. Sabretooth's behaviors are also far fetched and frustrating, I said to myself decide enough! The story of the mutation of Wolverine is wasted by a scratchy script. Only a few moments in X-2, which in a flashback, we see Wolverine with blood in Stryker's laboratory are more deep, more intense, more stunning than the whole mutation story in this movie. It was like by a few moments or one scene, Singer summarizes everything. There are a lot of reviews, in other words, many people say that X-Men Origins is much more better than The Last Stand. It shows that people are just weird. X-Men The Last Stand was disappointing in comparison with the first and the second movie, but it was very good. A brilliant opening scene (I mean child Angel), amazing action scenes, the tone of the movie recalls the comic book, visual effects were perfect and much more."

","I did not read the comic books, so I'm not mad if the story is different.<br/><br/>I'm mad if the story is boring.<br/><br/>This film is not ALL boring, but too broad, too into your face, too one-dimensional.<br/><br/>I just lost interest one hour into it, and even the not-dead-Kayla only mildly surprised me and her ending was clear.<br/><br/>In a film full of good special effects, I was disappointed when the first bad one came so early in : Viktor ""running"" up a wall - so BAD!!! The second bad effect that really shocked me was the logs stopping when raining down on Logan: Hello?? That was real bad editing and totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Why did Gambit fight Wolverine when he's just about to kill Viktor??? Why does Wolverine not decapitate Viktor when he has the chance?? Instead of talking about it - just do it! (I know, I know, not possible cause of the other films....lol) The Blob was soooooooooooooooooo bad!!! Gosh, the bad effects next to the good ones are even more shocking, and while you forgive them in a good film (like Spidey 1), here it takes you further out of the story.<br/><br/>The pace slows sooooo much after that, I thought Ma and Pa Farmhouse were just an intermission, when really they were the last real stop of the storyline. After that it's mashed together. And why does Logan say ""They were innocent people""??? As opposed to who??? Surely the man in the jungle not wanting to say where he got the space rock from wasn't guilty?? It's clear that Stryker is the guilty one, and he's not killed...lol.<br/><br/>I don't know.<br/><br/>And every time I write that after having seen a movie I at least know what that means: Will not watch it ever again.<br/><br/>No good story, no heart, no soul.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm just still holding a grudge on Wolverine for hooking up with Famke Janssen *urgh*...;-))), which ruined X-Men for me...lol<br/><br/>Everything's subjective anyway....<br/><br/>An unnecessary film. Cliev Schreiber is great in it, Jackman's OK, Danny Huston's great but bad badly edited. Nice effects. Story not convincing.<br/><br/>Not happy. I will never understand how people who spend so much money on something can hand over a product so faulty without a bad conscience. At least own up!!! (Yeah, that'll be the day....^^)"

","X-men Origins: Wolverine may not be the best in the X-Men series. I loved X-men and X2: X-men United. I was a little disappointed with Bret Ratner's X-Men: The Last Stand. X-Men Origins: Wolverine does make up for the third film. Not quite sure if it's the best comic book film, like The Dark Knight. There's is tons of action, a few laughs, and a lot of entertainment. I do wish Bryan Singer(The Usual Suspects, X-men, X2: X-Men United) would return to the series. But Gavin Hood doesn't do a bad job at all. The Plot: This is the prequel to the X-Men trilogy. This film revolves around James Howlett A.K.A. Wolverine. Him and his half brother Victor(Who later becomes Sabertooth)fight in all of these wars together. While in prison, they meet William Stryker, who tells them about a Black Ops team of mutants. After a while, Logan decides to leave the team, abandoning his brother Victor. Years later, Logan is living in the countryside with his girlfriend Kayla. One day, she is murdered, and Logan has an idea of who it is. Logan soon goes on the hunt for the murderer, meeting mutants like the Blob,and Gambit. The rest of the films plot is for you to find out when you see X-Men origins: Wolverine. I think you should."

Hugh Jacman and the rest of the cast were really well done. The CGI was good, but at some parts, not so good. Deadpool was done alright, not exactly like in the comics, but they could fix that in the sequel. The action scenes were really well done. Sabretooth was totally kick ass. The final scene where the two brothers fight Weapon11 was really well done, and the after credits part was superb. Gambit wasn't shown enough, but you can get over that.

It had great effects, great co-ordination for the stunts, acting was overall decent, there weren't many flaws. However, the film probably did focus too much on the action and not enough on wolverine's back story, and as well i don't think some of the characters were introduced properly, for example the john wraith guy wasn't really done well.

","I tried to watch one of the first two X Men films, I don't know what one it was, and it bored me to death, but despite that when I heard they were making a Wolverine film I was curious. As a teenager I went through an X Men phase, it didn't last long, but what I really liked was the Wolverine character. I even spent a small fortune (for a teenager) buying all the original Wolverine comics. This film did not disappoint (much). Dumb muscle bound fun. It's not intelligent and it doesn't try to be. It's actually quite a rare thing, a film that knows it's place. An exhilarating thrill ride from beginning to end. My only complaint was it should have been a lot darker..."

But unfortunately for me, it just didn't carry out the high expectations i had. I loved all the superhero characters and the acting was brilliant but i thought that the plot was good to begin with but became almost stupid near the end. I thought it contained great action and fantastic special effects but it was just the plot that ruined it for me. I am definitely not saying that the whole movie is rubbish because it is all very cleverly put together and also quite funny at times!

Of course it got this predictable scenes and it s a bit clumsy but that doesn t matter, because the fighting scenes are much fun to watch and a big point to the movie because it shows the rage, the anger fighting inside Wolverine. <br/><br/>The lenght of the movie was OK and good filled.<br/><br/>All in all it s a good movie with some mistakes, but if you like X Men and you like action you re going to have fun with this one."
"olivia-pellegrino","7","1","3","3 May 2009"," The movie that almost avoided disaster
","Okay, overall I enjoyed this film for what it was. A summer blockbuster following the now-popular superhero genre. However, I was expecting a bit more. Before I delve into that, I wish to mention Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth. I thought he fit the character uncannily well (Pun not quite intended). The man was frightening and certainly delivered what I had expected to be a stellar performance. Hugh Jackman also reprised his role fantastically, but I never doubted that.<br/><br/>So, I can say anything that I don't mention here didn't bug me. Everything below did.<br/><br/>1) This trailer was EXTREMELY misleading. Seriously folks, I'm speaking as a Marvel Comic reader of 12 years and I can honestly say I had a fangirl moment when I found out Deadpool was to be featured in this film. What disappointed me was the fact that he was only there for about ten minutes (Save for the end which was a bloody nightmare) 2) Far too many characters, far too little running time. I understand that you want to make everyone happy, but it was too cramped.<br/><br/>3) Gambit? No. As cute as Taylor Kitsch is (and boy oh boy he is cute) I feel he did not do the character total justice. His interpretation was nice, but as soon as Wolverine punched him out, everything went out the window. I blame the writers for turning him into a (Southern?? What happened to CAJUN?) chauffeur. Not a good way to handle one of your fanbases favourite heroes.<br/><br/>4) Like I said before, the ending of this movie. I was so upset. Thankfully, I stayed until after the credits, which kind of cheered me up. I'm still worried though. If Deadpool does get his own spin off (Which would be pretty cool if not botched up) than Marvel studios has a lot of explaining to do.<br/><br/>Final Verdict? I liked it. Really, I did. The stuff I mentioned was just stuff I needed to get off my chest. I'll definitely go see it a few more times on the big screen, if not just for Deadpool's fifteen seconds of fame.<br/><br/>Cheers!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","2 May 2009"," Limitations of prequels
","Those who have seen both the rise of the Lycans and the origin of Wolverine can't help noticing the common limitation the script writers face ‚Äì the audience pretty well knows how the main character as well as some of the key characters end up. And yet, there are differences.<br/><br/>Lycans has all the indication of an afterthought, just something to milk the last penny out of a considerably successful franchise. Lician is not even the main character and I would venture a guess that an average audience of Underworld doesn't really care about his past. The story of Logan/Wolverine, on the other hand, is long-expected, and overdue. After seeing some tantalizing hint at the end of X-men 1 and the start of X-men 2 that something is coming, the audience almost feel cheated, especially when the subject is all but forgotten in X-men 3. The mystery still remains (note that with Lucian, there is no mystery). And after all, Logan is arguably the most important of the ensemble of characters.<br/><br/>With such lofty expectations, it is not surprising that Wolverine comes across a little disappointing, even though it has considerably more to offer than the painting-by-number Lycans. It is a question of what you are comparing and in the shadow of the preceding trilogy, the limitation of a prequel unfortunately shows.<br/><br/>The plot is decently put together and adequately serviceable in tying up the loose ends. While hard core X-men comic fans may lay a perpetual curse on those who make Sabretooth Wolverine's brother, it is only fair to say that this works well for the movie, taken as a separate entity. Casting character actor Liev Schreiber in that role also adds to the appeal of the movie. The story of pacifist heroism, love, betrayal and revenge is quite adequate for anchoring what people really come to see: the action and the special effects.<br/><br/>The set pieces and CGI are worth what you pay for although with the proliferation of offerings in the special effect genre, it has become exceedingly difficult to impress. (Just as an aside, I still cannot forget that one scene in ""Knowing"", a movie that does not impress ‚Äì that one scene that really scared the hell out of me, despite so much that I have seen in the some 150 movies I watch each year in the last few years). Similarly, the action sequences are passing grade, but there is nothing you have not seen elsewhere before.<br/><br/>And believe it or not, people do come to see the X-men in X-men movies, even if this latest one focuses on a single agenda, Wolverine. Give the movie makers credit for attempting to deliver but with the pageantry that has come before, what can they hope to achieve - mild satisfaction, if that.<br/><br/>But in the end, there is Hugh Jackman. Wolverine has been voted the most popular character of all US comics, and Jackman has nothing to apologize for in claiming this larger-than-life role as his, as his alone. By the way, against all rumours, I do hope they'll invite him back for the next Oscar."
"shawn_m_roeder","7","1","3","2 May 2009"," Very Entertaining for Those Who Are Not Comic Book Purists
","I went in with low expectations because,until recently, a movie has never been made based on a comic book that did not dumb the plot and characterizations down. Therefore, this did not disappoint. The characters and the story may not be as complex as the comic books from which they are derived, but for the uneducated moviegoer, this is a very visual film with great action sequences and unexpected plot twists. For those of us who already know the story, the movie is not all that it could be based on the source material. However, 95% (Yes, I pulled that number out of the air.) of the time in art, the source material is the original inspiration and is always better. If a person goes in expecting to get a better connection with the source material, that person will be sorely disappointed. If, however, a person goes in expecting to see a violent story about a mutant with claws and an attitude who is seeking revenge, the movie delivers. Hugh Jackman plays a great Wolverine. Liev Schreiber's Sabretooth is also very well delivered."

When I was 7 years old i went to see X-Men directed by Brian Singer who I thought was an amazing director and who really did the movie good were as it could've been down terribly and wrecked the whole Marvel Industry before it really got started.<br/><br/>I really like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, because he really does look like Wolverine, with the exception of being a bit taller. I always liked how Wolverine (in the movies) wanted to know about his past but Professor X wanted him to find out himself. As well as his love triangle with Jean Grey and Scott Summers(Cyclops). This is my opinion and my knowledge that in the t.v. an comic series Logan(Wolverine) was never a semi father figure to Rouge. I like that story a lot I've just never heard of it. I'm also very glad that they've never made Wolverine wear his Yellow, Black, and Blue spandex. That would've just made the movie weird. I did like the joke that Cyclops made about it in X-men though, were Wolverine complains about the uniforms and Cyclops ask ""Would you rather wear Yellow spandex?"" I do like the uniforms they get up until The Last Stand. I know it was a tribute to the show or comic series having the colored stripes on them but I really don't think that anyone would ever have a Yellow or Pink stripe on there Suit besides when Bret Ratner makes it that way.<br/><br/>The movie (in my opinion) started kinda slow, but then really took off, it was really fast paced and you had to pay attention because there was a lot you could miss. As far as I knew Wolverine (in the comics and t.v. series didn't have claws until he had the Adamantium in him. But I'm probably way off. Hugh Jackman was amazing. I liked the guy that played Victor Creed, i liked him in CSI to.They should do another prequel movie with him. Origins is really gonna set the bar for more, I know there's a Magneto one in the works if Wolverine gets really good, but maybe they could do more, like Storm, Beast, Night Crawler maybe, but I'd really like to see a Colossus that'd be really cool. Ryan Reynolds wasn't in the movie for very long but he was really good in this, I liked how he was really comical with Stryker in the Elevator.<br/><br/>I didn't like that Stan Lee didn't have a cameo in this, he didn't have one in Ghost Rider, an at least the first Blade either.<br/><br/>The action is really good, and if your not even a big X-men fan, this movie is a just overall really good. It's worth a trip to the movies.<br/><br/>I give this a 8, but I'm gonna see it again so it might change."

","Cramming 1845 to 1960 in 20 minutes cheated viewers into an otherwise potentially rewarding sci-fi yarn from Marvel Comics.<br/><br/>Who was Sabretooth & Logan's father? Why did Sabretooth change from Thor with fangs in 1st X-Men of 2001 to a crewcutted Wolverine in 2009? Logan's loose ends were tied up better but not much... The whole premise of the picture could have been stretched to 3 films easily and do at same time like ""Pirates Of The C'bean"" to simplify and lessen drag of expectations.<br/><br/>If this was done more quickly, I doubt so many would have been disappointed. The first picture could expand more on who their father was (he obviously did not have the healing factor) and why there was a conflict with what turned out to be his step-father, what made Wolverine sick as a child and then sprout bone claws in stress.<br/><br/>A next picture could delve into Civil War, WW 1 and 2 then Vietnam which led to his joining up with Deadpool, Wraith and Blob, that expansion could be a teaser for last 30 minutes of current flick.<br/><br/>It's like - ""We know you're waiting but since we have a deadline this is what you'll get."" The movie lacked Julienning for my part, but I guess they were avoiding an ""R"" rating, Gambit is cool but too brief to really create a desire for more...

When he kicks ass he doesn't just rough you up. He f's you up! However with the restrictions of PG ratings Hugh's version of Wolverine can only tickle you with those claws. A problem that is rectified in the new Logan movie. Please see my Logan review for my thoughts on that.<br/><br/>X men Origins is a complete wasted opportunity. The opening credits would have made a far more compelling story to the one we actually got. Seeing Logan take part in numerous wars through out history. We could have learned what made him become the animal he is. Wolverine is a far more deeper darker character than most other Superheroes. Yet this film is as shallow as a kids paddling pool. I knew this film was going to go belly up as soon as we see junior Wolverine at the beginning. They could have at least got a boy who's testicles had dropped. When he screams in rage he sounded like a seven year old girl. Then a set of chop sticks begin to protrude from his hands and he kills his father. The only way he could kill someone with those little things is if he had fed his dad a rice ball with them and he choked to death. In this movie we see how Logan gets his Adamantium claws (again). Something already explained far better in the flashbacks shown in Bryan Singers two X men movies. What Singer did with thirty seconds was far more gripping than this entire movie. Remember X2 when Wolverine is screaming in agony, covered in blood as his claws come out for the first time. That's the tone we need. Instead Origins feels like it was shot to be an MTV music video. All style over substance. Will.i.am is in it for gods sake and even Logan's hairstyle makes him look like he's auditioning for a boy band. Here we are subjected to a watered down Wolverine. I don't mind seeing Logan get his Adamantium again but at least keep it in tone with what came before. Continuity is a word totally void in the X men movie universe. We only have to look at Sabretooth. In the first X men movie he looks like a half lion/human hybrid. In this he's Ray Donovan! Oh and he's Logan's brother. That was never mentioned before! Colonel Stryker? Where's Bryan Cox? He was an asset to the cast of X2 and instead they use Danny Huston. I even read somewhere that Cox was up for reprising the role. Why not use him. Give the audience something to relate to! Continuity!!!!!!!! Beloved characters are butchered far worse by the screen writers and studio execs than what Wolverine could ever do with those Adamantium claws. Take Deadpool for example. The studio executives should have been jailed for the crimes they committed against that character. What's with the swords coming out of his hands? How could he even bend his arms? Not to mention they sewed his mouth shut! The Merc with the mouth and they sew his mouth shut! Thank god Ryan Reynolds persisted to have another crack at it and nail it. I think Fox were far more willing to take a chance on Logan due to this. Another character, the Blob! The boxing ring scene, again totally the wrong tone for a Wolverine movie. That scene was like something straight out of a Three stooges sketch. Another totally ridiculous part is the whole Coo Coo cachoo nonsense! WTF is all that about? If you've seen the movie will know what I'm referring to. Utter drivel! To be fair I could go on for hours as this film is filled with so much tosh! It's not as a if they had a tiny budget to work with. $150 million to be exact. Compare that to Deadpools measly $58 million and you have to ask questions. We live in a post Jurassic Park world people. In 1993 they brought dinosaurs back to life yet in 2009 when Origins came out they couldn't even give Wolverine a convincing set of claws. They looked like he had stole them from Roger rabbit! The bathroom scene when he is clashing his claws together. I have seen better SFX on one of those movie maker apps you can get for your smartphone. It pains me so when I think back to this movie. The ridiculous finale when he frees all the mutant by cutting open the locks to their cages with his claws. All those incarcerated powerful mutants thwarted by a pad lock and some chicken wire! WTF!!! Then right at the end Professor Xavier turns up looking like a creepy guy who hangs around school gates! And what's with his face? He looks like he's had a fight with Botox- man and lost! Anyway rant over. The four stars I have awarded this is down to Hugh Jackmans commitment to the character and his performance. The guy is a legend and he tried his best with what he had. Believe me watch the new Logan movie. Now that's the real Wolverine."

","Because of all the continuity inconsistencies in the X-Men universe, I had forgotten quite a bit. Particularly, I forgot just how unfortunately mishandled X-Men Origins: Wolverine was. Hugh Jackman is one of the finest actors of our generation, and is quite good in the film, but he got stuck with a mess of a movie. This was another movie that nearly killed the franchise.<br/><br/>Before I get to the bad, and there's a lot of bad, let's talk about the good. I love me some Liev Schreiber and he absolutely kills it as Sabretooth. A whole lot better than whatever the heck that version of Sabretooth we got in the first X-Men, anyway. I know it was controversial to make him and Wolverine brothers, but I dug it. Ironically, I don't think he's called anything besides Victor Creed in the film. No matter, Schreiber brings a calm but vicious presence, similar to Jackman's Wolverine, which makes him the perfect antagonist. Oh, how I wish the film kept the focus on them.<br/><br/>Logan and Victor went through many wars and battles together, but they weren't always the only ones with special abilities taking on bad guys. Under the command of William Stryker, Logan and Victor fought on Team X (similar to X-Force), with the help of The Blob, Kestrel, Bolt, and none other than Deadpool. However, this only consists of 15 minutes or so of the film, and it only adds to confusing direction of this film. It really feels like the director, Gavin Hood, was forced to include several unnecessary mutants and cameos that were so far removed from the overall plot. A gratuitous fight with The Blob, a completely unnecessary role for Gambit, and a random appearance by Professor X and Scott Summers, really?<br/><br/>The film's strengths lie with the performances of Jackman, Schreiber, and a solid turn from Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox. Though, that performance from Collins is slightly undercut by a confusing character turn in the third act. The tone is not as much of the problem as I originally remembered. It's really the questionable studio decisions, including a legendarily awful mistake made with Deadpool (which I refuse to even discuss), that flush this film into a deep dark hole of comic-book hell. For some reason the Wolverine character has been a tough one to crack by himself on screen. Hopefully, 'Logan' can change that.<br/><br/>+Logan & Victor<br/><br/>+There's a good story in there somewhere<br/><br/>-So many unnecessary characters & cameos<br/><br/>-Bounces around and wanders too much<br/><br/>-One of the worst endings of all time<br/><br/>4.7/10"

Wolverine Origins tries to lazily ride that good will with a product so flat and devoid of effort that whoever put this together should be on Hollywood probation.<br/><br/>What makes this movie miss where the other X-Men movies have hit is making unrealistic mutants become real characters. Liev Schreiber deserves a Razzie. His impossible over-use of the sinister smile makes you wonder if anyone was even aware it was occurring as often as it did.

If you mess with the time-line or characters, then you ruin the memories of those who knew the story twenty years before the director even knew the story.<br/><br/>I can say only two things good about this movie, 1) it had good special effects and 2) it had an ending.<br/><br/>Special effects - 1 Script - 0 Directing - 0 Continuity (-1) Believability (0)<br/><br/>0 out of 5.<br/><br/>And the sequel looks just as bad... good grief!"

","Near the end of Gavin Hood's blockbuster debut, Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins), Wolverine's non- mutant girlfriend who has a ""gift"" for persuading people upon contact, grabs the leg of William Stryker (Danny Huston) and tells him to ""walk until your feet bleed...and then walk some more."" And in one of the most humorous misjudgments in recent action-movie history (aside from all of the movie's prior scenes), Mr. Hood shows Stryker in a mid-credits shot with (literally) holey boots and a sweat-stained doctor's shirt -- as if to give us a visual depiction of what a man looks like after he's walked until his feet bleed. This is the kind of director Hood has always appeared to be -- one so uncertain of either his actors, his own work, or the effect of the hyperbole in his picture's screenplay that he ends up disemboweling them altogether."

","Such potential. The greatest coolest Super Hero in the world...in the comics he drinks and smokes and gets the ladies and all without any smooth or manners or apologies (or hangovers). This story sold his history so short it was unforgivable. The story of his history was just credits. It was 5 minutes as a child, then all of a sudden he was fighting the civil war with Sabretooth, then every war thereafter, until Vietnam got too tough for him. So he had enough of Sabretooth's brutality after, what, 250 years? Took you long enough! He was 5 then 25. What happened in between? The real story of his adamantium is so much better. Why would he have trusted Striker? He was about to kill him. Then, ""oh okay, I trust you as long as I can kill Sabretooth and I have no memory of this conversation."" Dumb!!!! <br/><br/>Re-do this franchise. Re-do the X-Men. Where can ""First Class"" go now? Beast, Banshee and Havok? Only one of the originals? How do you bridge from First Class to X-Men? Havok is Cyclops's little brother. What would be wrong with going old school? It doesn't have to be as big as The Final Stand. Xavier doesn't have to die. There don't have to be 150 bad guys. It can just be a nice story, with beautiful angel effects, and a Jean Grey with hair.

"talarisw","8","1","4","7 May 2012"," Hugh Jackman returns as the iconic Wolverine, but this time he stars in his own spin off/prequel showing how he lost his memory and got his claws.
","This is a movie that will leave people divided, some will love it, others not so much and I understand both views. When I first saw this in theaters back in '08 I was disappointed by it but I decided to give it another chance and went to see it a second time and this time I liked it. So I see both good and bad in this. First let me say I'm a huge x- men fan and I loved all the previous movies. The good thing is that the film stayed pretty true to Wolverine's comic book origins. Weapon x, sabbertooth, silver fox and deadpool are all there. One great thing is that Wolverine is simply a interesting and cool character and he was well set-up in the previous films. The film starts off strong showing wolverine and sabbetooth as kids in the mid 1800's, they discover their powers and that their half brothers, which leads to the opening title showing the two fight in many wars as mercenaries, from the civil war to Vietnam. I like the idea of making Sabbertooth and Logan brothers, because in the comics the two were mortal enemies, their rivalry is legendary. So to make them brothers works well. Also like true enemies their more a like then they admit, both have animal like powers, healing powers and anger issues. Lievi Shreiber was a good fit as sabbertooth, he played it more low key then I imagined Sabbertooth but he captured his viciousness. Bad thing is he is never called sabbertooth he is only called by his real name Victor Creed. And there's no connections between the sabbertooth played Tyler Mane in first film and this one, which is disappointing because in the first film they hinted at a past relationship between Sabbertooth and Logan. However we meet Logan's love Silverfox, but unfortunately she's never called by her comic book name, but by her real name, Kayla. They did a good job at showing their relationship. The plot twist with Kayla was a little clich√© but worked for the movie and I like the casting. The film shows Logan's old team of mercenaries,it was brief but they appear individually through out the film. Wil.i.am has a nice part as one of the mercenaries. Ryan Reynolds plays Wade Wilson aka deadpool, who is a fan favorite for comic book geeks. Wade is known for being a mercenary with a wicked sense of human. Reynolds was perfectly cast in the role and had some great lines, although I think they should of gave him more dialog. Best line is when Ryan/Wade says about his swords ""Bring a couple of these to your ex- girlfriend's wedding and they will never ever forget it"". He appears later in the film as deadpool but he dosen't wear his trademark outfit, they should of had him wear the outfit and give him dialog. The film has a great villain in William Stryker played by Danny Hunston. Bad thing is there's not much similarities in the way Huston plays him to how Brain Cox played him X2. Cox had a southern accent and Huston dosen't for one. However he makes for a really a good villain. His true plan is not revealed right away and he does a good job at manipulating Logan. The films reveals wolverine's real name as James ""jimmy"" Logan, shows why he volunteered for the adanatium fusion, how he got the name wolverine, how old he is and how he lost his memory. I find some of these reveals a little anti-climatic but still satisfying. The film does a good job at truly capturing the concept that wolverine more or less can't die. Hugh does a good job at playing Logan. He plays him different in this one then in the others films, which is good,'cause Logan's in a different life. He's more brooding and more muscular here. Hugh is good at making Logan a sympathetic tough guy who wants to live a normal life but can't find it. We also get to see two legendary x-men characters, the blob and gambit. I like the actor playing Fred Dukes aka the blob, the evil mercenary from TV's lost. I like his look but I did't like how they explained his weight gain and the fight between blob & logan could of been better, the blob is a great villain but under used here. Gambit, my favorite x-men character is played by Taylor Kitcth. Overall he was good here, although he didn't speak french like in the comics but Taylor gives him a nice southern accent and he looks just like gambit from the comic books. I like how he fit into the story and I like seeing him in his home of New Orleans. I wish they would of showed him use more of his trademark game cards but I like his cane and seeing him playing poker and the fight between him and logan could of been better and no mention of him being a thief. However, I like that they went with wolverine having bone claws. Overall I think the movie is good. I understand how some people thought it was lackluster but I still enjoyed it. It had a good score and good cinematography. For me it was better watching it the second time. I think the problem is that the movie feels a little anti-climatic in a way but still gave us a good look into wolverine's origins."
"jmcginn174","6","1","4","16 June 2011"," To much for a 90 minute movie.
","WARNING SPOILERS! Let me first say I was expecting a lot from this movie since it was going to have three of my favorite characters in Wolverine, Gambit, and Deadpool.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a decent movie, that could have been better. First let me get to the stuff I didn't like.<br/><br/>1. Rating/length: What is with every movie out now being PG-13. They did it to Die Hard 4, and they did it to the new Terminator movie. COME ON IT'S TERMINATOR! And Wolverine isn't a PG-13 character. I know I've ranted on this subject before but it just irritates me.<br/><br/>Than there was the length of the film at about 95 minutes long which was way to short for all the information they were trying to feed us. You could also tell it was heavily edited. They should have made it 20 minutes longer, with it being rated R. I'm sure it would be a better movie.<br/><br/>2. Story: The story at the beginning was really good. Sadly as the movie went on it got worse. Mainly because they added to much in some X-Men characters and Professor X, and killing of important characters for no reason, which will leave no impact on the viewer.<br/><br/>3. Deadpool/Ryan Reynolds: This guy was truly a great character in the comics. He had a great back story, and entertaining character. He could be funny yet deadly serious at the same time. He was great and a breath of fresh air. He made you rut for the bad guy. In the movie he started out a great for the few minutes he was on screen. Sadly they decided to destroy the great character in a pointless way. Any of you out there hoping for a Deadpool movie, don't get your hopes up.<br/><br/>Now onto the things I liked.<br/><br/>1. Wolverine/Hugh Jackman: He is a really good actor, and I still think he does a really good job as Wolverine.<br/><br/>2. Sabertooth/Liev Schrieber: I thought he did a great job as Sabertooh. Much better than the guy who played him in the first X-Men movie.<br/><br/>3. Gambit/Taylor Kitsch: Gambit wasn't in the movie much, but he had an effect. Sure the guy didn't have a Cajun accent, but it still worked. I wish they had given him a little more time on screen.<br/><br/>4. Action/Special effects: They were great especially at the beginning. But by the end they weren't as good, almost anti-climatic.<br/><br/>Overall Wolverine was a decent movie that tried to do to much in a 95 minute movie."

","This origin story deliverers a film full of action, cool action sequences and fun characters. Hugh Jackman reprises the role of the tough Wolverine greatly and really brings to life the excitement of the story. Whilst being a great watch, it didn't have the exact amount of sophistication as the previous X-Men films because they felt like they really focused on the feelings of the characters and how they deal with the hatred against their kind. Even though this film does show how Wolverine goes on an amazing journey it relies mainly on the action, which isn't totally a bad thing but the X-Men films didn't have to mainly focus on the action. However, you can't deny that this film is a great addition to the X-Men franchise and deliverers a great adventure."

",""" X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" provides fans with a back story showing how Logan (aka Wolverine) got his retractable adamantian claws. This prequel to the Marvel Comics' ""X-Men"" franchise is otherwise a pretty tepid affair, lacking the sharp sociopolitical underpinnings that so distinguished the first installment in the series (the franchise has been in steady decline since that stunning opening salvo).<br/><br/>It's true that Logan is a bit of a tortured soul in this film - he just wants to be left alone to live his life as a lumberjack with his beautiful girlfriend by his side, but no one will let him - but it's an inner conflict without much emotional resonance or dramatic impact. The reluctant mutant is up against not only his own brother, Victor, but Stryker, the de facto mad scientist who's kidnapping all the other mutants so he can perform diabolical experiments on them.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, while the roles of Victor and Stryker have been taken over by Liev Schreiber and Danny Houston, respectively. The movie also features Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch (from ""Friday Night Lights""), Dominic Monaghan (from ""Lost"") and Will.i.am in relatively minor roles.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well-done from a technical standpoint, but they would be a great deal more compelling if we understood just how vulnerable or invulnerable each character was at any given moment in the drama (their status seems to swing wildly back and forth depending on the individual scene and circumstance)."

So, I was expecting to really like this movie since it's all about Wolverine. Well, the story wasn't great and neither were the special effects. The coolest scene was already shown in the advertisements for the film, and that was when Wolverine escapes the water tank after just getting the transformation. And they really cheapened the death of Logan's girl at the end. That was lazy writing. Even the finally battle between Logan, Victor, and ""Wade"" was no where near as good as the fighting scenes from X-Men.

"Scarecrow-88","6","1","4","28 September 2009"," X-Men Origins:Wolverine
","When I first read about the one cast as the great Marvel X Men character Wolverine, I asked myself, ""Hugh Jackman? Who's Hugh Jackman?"" Once I watched Bryan Singer's X Men for the first time, I needn't bother asking it anymore because not only had Jackson impressed me as the mighty Wolverine, but I can no longer see anyone else in that role but him. That said, his character's self-titled 2009 X Man Origins movie dispenses with worrying about a rich, textured plot, there's merely a series of situations tacked on big budget action sequences. I mean you see the green bleeding all over the place, I was curious as to how much the opening war sequences, merely seconds-only vignettes showing Logan and his brother, Victor Creed(Liev Schreiber)fighting side-by-side against the enemy, actually cost.<br/><br/>This film moves an incredibly rapid pace, shooting from scenario to another, barely catching a breath. Logan and Creed decide to join a military leader, William Stryker(Danny Huston)on secret missions for their government..their options are limited considering Creed's homicidal tendencies led to his killing on of their own, Logan with little to do but support his brother. Logan realizes that Stryker is a corrupt sociopath willing to resort to any measures necessary in order to retrieve a type of material, found from a type of meteor which fell to the earth, Adamantian steel which can do wonders for the anatomy of the proper human host who could withstand such abnormal biological change. Logan has moved on with his life, working as a logger within a breathtaking Canadian wilderness, finding a comforting relationship with Kayla Silverfox(Lynn Collins). Meanwhile, Victor is hunting down members of Stryker's former squad, those with specific powers who decided to leave the evil regime. Soon Victor finds Logan's locations, and Kayla appears to have been collateral damage. Stryker appeals to Logan for returning to him, offering a certain surgical procedure which could give him unlimited power, using the Adamantian material to completely change him into an anatomical anomaly. This would give him the power to engage his brother and get revenge..but, what ultimately happens is Logan discovers that Stryker was behind the whole ordeal regarding Kayla, understanding later, when he meets up with old comrades, John Wraith(Will i Am)and Fred Dukes(Kevin Durand)that he is hunting down mutants, deriving their various powers in the goal of creating one type of all powerful soldier, conducting his experiments on an island. Logan will not stop until he finds Stryker, needing the help of a mutant who got away, Gambit, a gambler with remarkable powers like twirling cards which have such force they can send bodies through brick walls..as Logan will find out all too well.<br/><br/>While there seems to be plenty of plot, stringing together various other sub-plots including the introduction of Gambit(Taylor Kitsch)and Scott Summers(Tim Pocock), aka Cyclops, the whole movie is essentially ""show us the characters for a moment or two then get to the good stuff"". You get plenty of duals between Creed and Logan, bodies stabbed into and thrown into various large objects. Buildings crumble and / or are blown apart by mutant powers(..awesome scenes include Gambit's incredible use of a cane and Scott's laser eyes sending penetrating beams which tear apart a school building). Danny Huston, as Stryker, shows here how good he can be as a villain, given only just snippets of screen time to work his magic. Dominic Monaghan(..as a mutant whose powers manipulate electrical power, controlling an elevator or sparking light bulbs)and Will i Am(..as a mutant who can move from one distance to another in a flash, actually reminding of The Flash)have nice, if minor, cameos, but Ryan Reynolds is wasted as a swordsman with wicked mad skills at stopping bullets through swift(..to say the least)technical maneuvers..he's quite arrogant and unflappable, but he only appears at the front, replaced at the end by a stuntman. Daniel Henney is Agent Zero, his skills at using guns properly efficient at removing the line of defense when his boss' teams are being shot at..Zero also unflinchingly answers his master's commands without a degree of remorse or guilt regarding who he kills, including an elderly couple who give shelter to Logan. A surprising amount of profanity, I thought, for a Marvels feature rated PG-13, but when Wolverine stabs those who combat him, you rarely, if ever, see blood which was kind of a drag. A major disappointment to me was seeing Stryker's original regime receive such little time together as only one major action sequence, where they seize upon the lair of a militant, features this group. I'm pretty sure Reynolds desired more action than he receives. But, this is Wolverine's show all the way, no doubt, despite the fact that Schrieber's Creed had plenty of ""time to kill."""

That was just what I did after renting it a couple days ago, and it was better for me this time than it was in the theatre, unsurprisingly, but there were still significant problems.<br/><br/>In 1845, a young boy named James Howlett lives in North-Western Territory, British North America (not yet Canada). His father, John, is killed by Thomas Logan, the father of James' friend, Victor Creed, and as revenge, the boy stabs the killer with the bone claws from his hand! Before Logan dies, he tells James that he is his real father. James then runs away, and is joined by Victor, who tells him, ""brothers protect each other."" As the decades go by, the brothers stay together, fighting alongside each other in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. Eventually, Major William Stryker offers them to join Team X, a group of military mutants. They take the offer, but James is soon disgusted by this group's actions and leaves, finally parting ways with his brother after more than a century. He retreats to civilian life in Canada, starts going by the name Logan, and lives with his girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox. One day, he finds his girlfriend murdered by Victor, and thus begins a mission against his brother, and soon against Stryker as well, after he tries to erase Logan's memory!<br/><br/>It's been a few months since this ""X-Men"" prequel's theatrical release, and I probably can't find anything critical to say about it that hasn't been said at some point since then, but I'm not as sure of what brings it down in entertainment value as much as many others seem to be. It may have more than one thing in common with the third film in the original trilogy. For example, it's not as deep as it could have been, and probably could have been more focused. You can also say there are characters who aren't properly introduced, something else it has in common with ""The Last Stand"". I didn't find it as interesting without the other famous characters from the series (some of which appear VERY briefly here), especially Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto, and without the X-Mansion. I'm not sure what else to say about this polarizing prequel to further criticize it, except for the fact that I was fairly bored at times, especially early in the film.<br/><br/>Unlike many disappointed fans, I can't exactly consider ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" bad. There are some good action sequences, it may get more exciting as it goes along, and Hugh Jackman is still great as Wolverine. There's also some humour in the film, such as Logan (yet to become Wolverine) referring to Kuekuatsu as ""Coo Coo Ca Choo,"" an elderly couple seeing Wolverine running naked into their barn, and parts of the main character's meeting with Fred Dukes in the ring. These things are enough for me to consider this movie slightly above average, but no more than that, with the flaws the film suffers from. Some people might even think I'm crazy for thinking it's any better than ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", and I'm sure there are people who were not disappointed by that third installment in the trilogy, but were with this first prequel. Since it's been over a year since I last saw the three ""X-Men films"", it's not as easy to make comparisons. Anyway, neither the 2006 nor the 2009 film can match Bryan Singer's two efforts, and I don't know if this movie's sequel, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2"", is a good idea."

","I'm a big fan of the previous 3 X-Men movies so I was looking forward to this one. I'm also a fan of the directors previous films. Unfortunately this movie was not in the same league as those films. Almost from start to finish the dialogue is cheesy, the action scenes over the top and the plot is ridiculous. It also seems to live outside the universe established in the original movies and throws continuity out the window. By the midway point I was ready to walk out of this movie but continued to watch it just to see if it could get any worse. It did. Gambit was my favourite character in the X-Men cartoon when I was a kid and was excited to see him introduced to the series. Unfortunately it seems the only reason he was in this movie was to please fans. He had nothing to do with anything in the plot. This was a terrible movie and a complete waste of time."

Perfect plot everything was organized and everything. I don't know why people complain so much and I'm very impressed with the fact that Hugh Jackman was able to be in all the X movies after all these years.This movie was much better than what I expected and I really enjoyed it because it grabbed my attention from the beginning and I love how they finally show the past of Wolverine and how he became the way he is. I really expected less but it turned out to be a great movie to me. I hope Hugh Jackman can become Wolverine for a long long time. I give this movie a 10/10!"
"mgayles2005","5","1","4","11 June 2009"," I need an amnesia bullet to forget this film...
","Great super hero films only come around as often as Hailey's Comet. That means last year was miraculous: two great super hero films in the same year. 2009 will not be so lucky. ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" has come to fill the void between ""The Dark Knight"" and the next great super hero picture.<br/><br/>To put it simply: it gets it wrong, very, very wrong. It has a hero with no physical or emotional vulnerability. It has plenty of action with nothing at stake and violence with no consequence. And the very goal of this origin story is to build a character, and it can't even do that right.<br/><br/>The story is about the beginnings of Wolverine. At first he's just a boy named James Howlett living in 19th century Canada with his brother Victor. James witnesses the murder of his father and kills the attacker, only to learn the attacker is his real father. James and Victor dash into the woods, and through the magic of editing we leap into the future, where James and Victor become Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber. They fight in nearly every major American war, they join the special weapon X program, and turn against one another when Victor murders the love of James's life. This leads James to be injected with adamantium, making him invincible, change his name to Wolverine, and seek revenge against his brother.<br/><br/>And throughout all of this Hugh Jackman doesn't do much besides smirk, snarl, growl, say bub a few times and scream. He does a lot of screaming. There are long action sequences where Wolverine just stands around while other mutants do the fighting. Liev Schreiber attempts to inject some personality into his role but he's a lost cause in a film like this.<br/><br/>About those other mutants, there are a lot of them. Most of them are unnecessarily jammed into the story to make the fans happy. There's agent Zero who doesn't seem to have any specific power, just a lot of them. There's the blob, an obese boxer who looks like a combination between fat bastard and Billy idol. Ryan Reynolds is dead pool, aka ""the merc with the mouth"", who's one-liners provide the films only humor. We see him later on with his mouth sewn shut. And Cyclops shows up late in the film, just to show up.<br/><br/>The most insulting of all is Gambit, my personal favorite X-Man. His only purpose is to take Wolverine from point A to point B in his air plane. Taylor Kirsch is terribly miscast, and extremely bland. His Cajun accent flickers on and off. His power is having a magical stick that provides an over kill of mediocre special effects.<br/><br/>And despite an onslaught of special effects, none of them impress. It never seems as if this was a 100 million dollar film, even though the budget was 150 million dollars. I would have guessed 60 million. The effects lack the polish and level of detail you would expect from such a project. There's a scene where Wolverines claws are so poorly rendered they look hand drawn. There's a scene where an entire barn is engulfed in an explosion and Wolverine emerges from it without a single singe of his hair or clothes, while riding on top of a gasoline powered motorcycle that isn't so much as scratched. There are major editing mistakes to go along with the effects. There is a scene where Wolverine walks far away from a building only to reappear in it a split second later.<br/><br/>To be fair I've seen worse. This inst a terrible film, but its bad in the sense that I can't say any thing positive about it. There is no point in watching it. It takes two hours just to tell you something you already know, and to tell you things you would never want to know, like the cause of Wolverines amnesia. It's just a complete waste of time and money, the time and money it took to make it and the time and money it takes to watch it.<br/><br/>This film was directed by the formerly independent Gavin Hood, who's film ""Tsotsi"" won an Oscar for best foreign language film. This film was a modest hit so don't expect Tsotsi 2 any time soon."
"dansousae","5","1","4","29 May 2009"," Mediocre
","Too Much and too little. This film seemed to me like the film makers tried too hard to throw in as many characters and as many big names as they could in an attempt to bulk up the movie. This created a lack in the plot itself and strayed from the strict story line and the characters themselves. Yes we do follow Logan through his life and understand how Wolverine came about, but at the same time the plot was rushed and bland at best. It was predictable and seemed to jump all over the place. The character of Sabertooth was well cast but lacked many details and background that those of us who read the comics would definitely agree should have been addressed in the film. Gambit could have been a huge factor in bettering the story but was thrown into a few sequences and gone as soon as he arrived. Ryan Renoylds?? Seriously?? Who's idea was it to cast him in an action comic plot? It's almost like if they would have cast Brittany Spears as Logan's love interest. Also the final Villain was a weak cheap attempt at an ending at best. In a nutshell the writers took the basic story line that was introduced in the second X-men and threw it into a pot and proceeded to throw in any other crap they thought might look cool or sell movie tickets. Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it's a renter at best."
"Quebec_Dragon","5","1","4","23 May 2009"," Unfortunately generic and uninspired
","It has nice action scenes, although a few were cut too rapidly to follow, and adequate earnest performances from Wolverine (Jackman) and his brother nemesis but overall this felt very average and generic. The story was pedestrian and unengaging (except for the promising start), the dialogs were mostly lame, the music was just there (not really noticeable actually) and although some of the CG effects were decent, a few were weak and noticeable as computer effects (especially the end). The directing was competent but uninspired.<br/><br/>Wolverine lacked a certain X factor that would have made me care about him or the secondary characters even though, considering some of the tragedies, I should have. Perhaps it's because you don't see the secondary characters enough on-screen, perhaps it's because their characterization was lacking or perhaps it's because there's too many of them. I won't get started on the many liberties taken over the source material and I tried not to evaluate it based on that. Perhaps by their very nature, prequels cannot be as interesting or suspenseful as the originals because in a way you already know the final result. It felt to me the weakest of the X-Men movie franchise and rather disappointing. I was entertained but barely and I'm not particularly interested in seeing it again anytime soon.<br/><br/>Rating: 5.5 out of 10"
"MrKlette","6","1","4","21 May 2009"," Good craftsmanship, but...
","When I went to see this movie I expected some action-flick, fast, fun, good old entertainment. And that is what I got. Plus, the whole thing was focused on Wolverine's character-development - in a fast way. Very fast, that is, jumping through important stages and relationships only to slow down just before the beginning of the story of the first X-Men- Movie, where the good old revenge-theme is played upon, sidelined by the rare moral-moment when the main antagonist and his primary tool are pardoned, because it would have made the good ones bad to kill them. Killing dozens of bystanders: hey, no problem there. So here we are in the middle of the mess. There was all the fun, the action, good actors (especially Liev Schreiber, whose part in 'Wolverine' was a little bit similar to the role he played very well in Defiance), amazing pictures, stunts, S/E, soundtrack... but the story, well, seems to have been left behind a bit. Especially when it came to the baddies' deeds. Build some indestructible guy to destroy him afterward? Look into the magic box and pull out a good old gun with bullets (six) that alone can destroy the indestructible soldier - and keep them away from the hunters? In the end they do not kill him but erase his memories? And the bad guys answer to the announcement that the big 'we' financing his little show knows about his deeds and will shut him down? He kills the messenger. I could go on for a little while, but why should I bother with the details, when the movie didn't, which is exactly why it is just an average action- flick and nothing more."
"aleexx_1920","4","1","4","14 May 2009"," wolverine is no dark knight
","Wolverine i thought was one of the few characters of the xmen series that can have his own movie. I like the first lets say 20 mins in this film but hated the rest because this movie was plain and very clich√© movie moving from wolverine origins to a typical revenge movie and overall I was disappointed, even the mutant myth and complexity is gone which the first xmen movie which in my opinion is the best showed. There is no intensity or any feel of danger in this film with no surprises. The movie should of just have wolverine and enemy sabertooth because crunching other comic characters was such a waste, In the movie wolverine gets information from every a comic character, then they have a useless fight between for no reason, the built up of the fight scene how it begins is boring especially Gambit. When I left the cinema there was really nothing to talk about with this movie, it just feels like a cheap spin off.<br/><br/>However I understand being this is wolverine's movie that some of the characters you have to buy the fact that they appear in the movie without being too much develop. But I thought they should of have Ryan Renolds as an asset to this but was wasted in this movie. Ryan was golden and perfect match playing Wade Wilson for the small screen time he had and his action scene was the best of the film, thats why i like the first 20 minutes or so, but like I say his character was wasted in this movie and wade Wilson would of been a memorable character but was quickly forgotten because he was hardly in it.<br/><br/>Wolverine is not as dark, compelling or animalistic as I thought it would of been. Oh and one more thing sometimes a movie just gotta be rated R I mean come on wolverine has these blades and he's fighting people slicing and dicing them both no blood. <br/><br/>Uninspired action flick rent it"
"gigan-92","1","1","4","13 May 2009"," Is it a Spin-Off Or a Pathetic Prequel? Either Way, Total Garbage
","F+ Well, I'm afraid to announce once again Bryan Singer has let someone else ruin his masterpieces. First it was Brett Ratner with the disappointing ""X-Men III"", now this mediocre film. Gavin Hood did not belong in the director's chair but Fox was so eager to release yet another sequel, I just guess they didn't feel like waiting on Mr. Singer. The story is okay, minus A LOT of the horrible lines. It almost makes you think this spin-off is a prequel, or is it? But once again we have a very rushed story ending with a film not even reaching 110 minutes! When will these directors realize that for a film with so many super-powered humans a little more time to develop the characters would be much appreciated? Who knows. The cast was okay. Hugh Jackman is back to play the role no one else could thankfully, but he must yell at least five or six times in this flick. Enough with the roaring Hugh Jackman with no shirt on! We already know he's buff. I love Ryan Reynolds, but as in ""Blade: Trinity"", he just happens to be in the crummy sequel following an extraordinary one. Not that it matters, the suit of Deadpool is skewered, more on that tragedy later. <br/><br/>Two characters I'm very disappointed with are Sabertooth and Stryker. Sabertooth is portrayed okay by Liev Schreiber, a pushing it okay albeit. But Danny Huston had no business playing Stryker. His performance was crappy compared to Brian Cox's portrayal of the character. Gambit could've used more screen time and Will.I.Am simply didn't belong in this film. Hood even tries to cameo Anna Paquin and Patrick Stewart, but I for one am not impressed. The action nothing special, especially considering in the comics Wolverine is a vile and very violent bastard, but in the movie he's more of a pacifist whose supposed love is killed. Deadpool, like Gambit, received little to no screen time. I mean Deadpool having his mouth sown shut? It defeats the whole purpose of the character. And the end battle is over rated by audiences. Plus the chase scene on involving a chopper and a motorcycle was horrendously over the top. To add to this film the score was terrible, being as everything else in this movie, average. Enough said I believe."
"IAMOdoodles","2","1","4","11 May 2009"," Could have been better.
","Not a good movie. It seems the filmmakers could not decide between doing a Wolverine solo-story or an X-Men prequel, and decided to cram in any character from the comic books that could not fit in the previous movies. Some characters like Remi LeBeau (Gambit), Emma Frost (White Queen, with no sign of her comic book counterpart's telepathic mutant ability), and even Scott Summers (Cyclops), feel so unnecessary, underused, and forced when you know that they have nothing to do with the Wolverine origin stories from the comic books. And, Jesus Holy Christ! What did they do to Deadpool?!!! Ryan Reynolds does a great job at portraying the motor-mouth satirical mercenary we know, but then they decided to shut him up and turn him into a lobotomized Frankenstein monster that makes the whole third act of the movie fall apart. What's the point of having a Deadpool who can't talk? Victor Creed (Sabretooth) is a cool character in this movie, but they don't explain why he is just a big dopey beast in the first X-Men movie. So, I guess the only reason the movie works is Hugh Jackman, who is obviously very devoted to the Wolverine character. Could have been better."
"dino_saur333","7","1","4","4 May 2009"," Had the same problem as Spiderman 3
","And that problem is way too many characters with way too little development time. If you're a big fan of the comics and a few choice characters you will be slightly disappointed at how little screen-time certain characters get.<br/><br/>There were two characters I would've wanted to see more of: Gambit and Deadpool. Both characters have deep backgrounds to them and are both very interesting. However the movie treats them as throwaway characters with each getting less than ten minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>And then there's Cyclops. Really? Why bother putting him in the posters if you'll give him such a small part. They practically threw him away in X3 and now they just used him as fodder. Does Hollywood really have that little respect for all the really deep and interesting characters? However, at least I got what I expected most of the movie: a not too complicated but still personal story of Wolverine, kick-ass action scenes, and a tying up of many of the loose ends from the original X-men trilogy. The script and screenplay were very good and the director did a good job putting this movie together.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings, fans will find something to enjoy here. And if you've seen all the other X-men movies then I recommend you check this out."
"rich8606","5","1","4","4 May 2009"," A decent action movie but...
","Great script, great sets, fleshed-out characters, forget about them, you're not going to find it here. If you love X1 and X2 for all those things stated above, most likely you'll dislike this movie. What you'll get, are actions, plenty of 'decent' actions. This is not the Wolverine origin story fans were waiting for.<br/><br/>As an origin story, this movie fails at so many levels. This movie should've chronicled the birth, the life and times of Wolverine, the origin of adamantium itself, leading all the way to project Weapon X and Wolverine losing his memory. Wolverine first appeared in comics in mid 70s and is one of the most famous modern superhero of the bronze age era for god's sake. The filmmakers should have a lot of material to work with and they should've treated a character this big with respect. Yet they managed to sum up the first couple of hundred years of Wolverine's life in a 5 minute opening montage and have little to no story nor character development for the rest of the movie. Events leading to the climax are a bunch of action sequences stringed together by shallow dialogue scenes. We never learned why wolverine stopped aging at his age, after aging for hundreds of years; in fact, nothing is explained. Just like X3, many characters appear and not handled well, as if they appear for no reason other than for merchandising purposes.<br/><br/>As an action movie, the actions are okay and entertaining enough, it should satisfy anyone who just wanna watch Wolverine slicing and dicing at anything that comes at him. Excessive wireworks hurt the fight scenes, save for one big fight at the end. For a 150 million dollar movie, the special FX look unconvincing at times, especially ones involving explosions, but overall looks fine for a summer blockbuster. <br/><br/>It's hard to appreciate this movie after last year's Iron Man and The Dark Knight. So, if you expect this movie to be as good as X1, X2 or Iron Man and TDK, you might want to stay away from this.<br/><br/>If you can appreciate the action sequences, you might enjoy it. It's at least fast-paced and not boring for an action movie, there's always action every a few moments.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","In 2002 X2 arrived and marked one of the strongest Marvel sequels ever made and inevitably in 2006 X3-The Last Stand arrived and boy did it suck. A change of director caused a change of setting, style, tone, character development and to be frank skill. The man who brought the world Chris Tucker almost single-handedly killed of a franchise so here we are three years later in 2009 with the X-Men Team dropped and replaced by the first of a new Origins series and of course we start with Wolverine, the show hog of the first three movies.<br/><br/>The opening sequence follows Wolverines back-story from a brief childhood scene to his many cameos at each major war America has been involved in - so there are quite a lot. James (young Wolverine) and Victor (Young Sabertooth) travel the world together and in true montage form Victor strays further towards the dark-side whereas James becomes more moralistic with each war. At the end of the opening credits montage we are introduced to William Stryker. James and Victor are recruited into his mercenary programme, which include mutants as Agent Zero, Beak (rather pointless) John Wraith (token black character), Fred Dukes, who literally grows into Blob and Wade Wilson played by the scene stealing Ryan Reynolds.<br/><br/>The hype surrounding the Wade Wilson cameo was huge and it would be interesting to see just how large that role was intended to be. Ryan Reynolds had about ten lines in total but completely stole the show as anyone who fights with swords in an automatic machine gun era generally would. This didn't surprise me and I was ready for all the Deadpool Origins rumours that would no doubt start but the fate his character met has made be doubt that would ever happen which is the most depressing part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Obviously the most important aspect of any Wolverine story is adamantium and we were treated to a strong solid explanation as to how he came to be equipped with his adamantium skeleton and claws and it was done in such a way that justified Wolverines need for vengeance against Stryker and Sabertooth and he enlists the help of Remy le Beau, Gambit, and escapee from The Island (stupid name), a facility Stryker had set up to experiment on mutants to create a super mutant.<br/><br/>Fans of Wolverine, X-Men and Marvel either love Gambit or hate him. There are those who think it is sacrilege that the only mention of Gambit in the X-Men movies is his name flashing up on a computer and there are those who think that he would add nothing to proceedings. I am a 90's kid, I watched the X-Men cartoon so I am the former. I was eagerly awaiting Gambits first appearance on the big screen and I wasn't disappointed. The accent wasn't quite what I was expecting but was anyone ever honestly expecting a good Cajun accent? If anything it is most likely a Gambit Origins movie we will get when you see how his character was left hanging in the end -Wolverine ditched him and he never caught up with Scott Summers and Emma Frost so never got to join the X-Men¬Ö..nice cameo at the end by the way! Live Schrieber was very good as Sabertooth - as good as Jackman is Wolverine. They played off each other well but they were both out performed in the fight stakes by Weapon 11 in the final battle but if ever there is a call to have Sabertooth in a movie I hope they have Schriebers number on speed dial.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to Wolverine but I was nervous too. If this movie bombed it would probably mark the end of the X series and poor cold water on any future attempts at a spin off but luckily it was a good movie. It was quite slow to start with but once injected with adamantium the movie picked up pace and we were off. As with most action movies the love interest scenes are the weakest but that is just part and parcel of any movie.<br/><br/>I would give it 7/10. It loses a point for the lack of Deadpool, Gambit, the pointless lumberjack scenes (just get on with it) and a point for throwing in a full naked Jackman waterfall scene without prior warning as I nearly choked on my Smarties trying to get my neck craned at the appropriate angle at such rapid speed. Other than that it was all good."

Same goes for the rest of the bunch. We see him and some fellow mutants. And each one does one or two mutant tricks, and that's about it for every and the whole character. All these characters have so much more potential than what is shown on the screen.

"das417","6","1","4","1 May 2009"," An average story about two brothers
","Wolverine is one of the main heroes of the X-Men and the idea of a movie focusing on his ""origins"" was bound to be one that would receive much support from fans of the series. However, X-Men Origins: Wolverine may be a movie that most fans will compare to X-Men The Last Stand, a less than impressive accomplishment since there was great expectations for the movie. <br/><br/>Logan (Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) are two brothers with unique powers. Escaping their Canadian childhood home in the 1840's, the two brothers will spend the next 100 years fighting in every war from the American Civil War to Vietnam. Ignoring the fact that these are Canadians who seem to like fighting for America, the two brothers find that their talents and abilities make them the perfect soldiers. Victor, more so than Logan, finds a taste for blood that eventually turns off Logan who himself has grown tired of the constant fighting and death.<br/><br/>A mission in Vietnam ends with the death of a superior officer and a death sentence. However, the invincibility of the two brothers attracts the attention of Colonel William Stryker (Danny Huston) who would rather see the two of them work with his own team of soldiers. Men, who like Logan and Victor, possess special powers that make them stand out. The problem, for Logan, is that this leads to more death and a feeling of revulsion. He abandons not only Stryker's team but also Victor.<br/><br/>Years later, Logan has made a comfortable life in the Canadian Rockies with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins). Tragedy soon follows Logan and, when he believes Kayla has been murdered by Victor, Logan will take the first steps that will lead to the creation of Wolverine. Logan has been fighting the beast within for years but now he will see that he has to unleash it in order to solve the mystery of Kayla's death. Not only will he become the weapon he always had the potential to be, Logan will discover that vengeance will not always bring redemption. <br/><br/>The problem is that there really isn't more to draw us into the story. Instead of focusing in on the transformation from ""man"" into ""animal"", X-Men Origins instead uses overblown special effects, explosions, and pointless camera shots of slow motion rage. An average movie about two brothers, X-Men Origins suffers from not enough depth. There isn't enough time spent on the history of Logan or Victor to make us care about their relationship. A better movie would have focused upon their past instead of jumping straight to the present. What other experiences did the two share that lead them to two opposite lives? There is more to the story but we never see it. There is a sense of rivalry between the two but it is never explained except that Victor seems to suffer from low self esteem. The use of other minor mutants only distract since their stories are never explained either.<br/><br/>A disappointment that compares to The Last Stand, fans will not be excited. The X-Men series will have to ensure that the next movie is able to live up to the standards of the first two movies. <br/><br/>6/10"

It was awful what they did to Deadpool. And that is despite the fact that it was awful what they did to Wolverine's Origin story.<br/><br/>Pick a plot and stay with it!!!!! And then they said:<br/><br/>""No, we are going to make Wolverine's first solo movie entirely in montage."" And they said it in a tone that was almost like a snooty French artist.<br/><br/>That is really what it was, one long montage of Wolverine's life with just a sliver of an actual story to tie it all together at the end and mess up Deadpool for about 8 years.<br/><br/>It starts off as a montage...and then the montage clips just get a little longer, and a little longer, and then there is a fight at the end and....<br/><br/>The audience is left that sort of ""uh"" feeling...and angry about Deadpool."

","I just watched the movie and it did look good to me. There was not a great punch in the story. In fact it didn't seem very original to me.<br/><br/>The action stunts were quite good. I enjoyed watching them. Hugh Jackman looked perfect in the Role of Logan/Jimmy/Wolverine. His character is one that has immense strength and even before the transformation, his body looks so good that it doesn't make the viewer hard to believe that he can knock down several men on his own accord.<br/><br/>The character of Victor played by Liev Screiber was commendable. He did seem to have a monster hidden in him which thirsted for blood. His evil desire to kill people didn't seem completely unreasonable.<br/><br/>Colonel Stryker played by Danny Huston is another well played character. He seems intrigued by the mutations and then he does manifest an evil look right from the beginning. His expressions are always a mixture of good and bad and the viewer doubts his intentions from the beginning. This doesn't leave the audience surprised when they discover the truth about all the weapons he's creating.<br/><br/>The special team that works with Colonel Stryker looked quite good to me. As I said, there was not a great story that laid in the movie but the action, stills, special effects, made it worth a watch.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman looks like a hunk! Overall, a movie that can be watched at least once."

","The beginning was interesting, so a few minutes in I was getting excited that this might be as good as the first two. But then the clever beginning ended. What followed was a story that in no way reflected what we learned in the previous three. For instance, in X-Men 2: X-Men United we learn that Wolverine went through a huge ordeal getting that metal implanted, they tore him up and inserted it not just shooting some needles into his head. There was a flashback of blood everywhere and him not knowing what the claws were (It was implied that the procedure was so brutal, he blocked it out along with the rest of his memory). This movie of course decided to make it look all good and pretty. There were several of these occurrences in the movie.<br/><br/>One of my other grudges was how cyclops happened to have glasses that would stop his ability (before he met the professor). Who made them? And I don't think sunglasses alone would prevent him from waking up at night and blowing a whole in his ceiling.<br/><br/>It is a movie though, so I understand why they would take the cowardly approach and not attempt to make it realistic, like how cyclops's ability (used by the super mutant) would be completely stopped by wolverines claws. Perhaps if he had adamantium armor where there weren't holes in the suit, that might have worked.<br/><br/>The worst part was that the only people in the movie I actually liked (the guy that controls electricity and the old married couple) are killed off.<br/><br/>Why I am giving this a 3 instead of a 1? Because Hollywood accomplished what they set out to: Make money without spending a lot of it."

Though this movie's far from being terrible, it does fall WAY SHORT of what it could have, should have been.<br/><br/>Wolverine has a dark, tortured and horrific past, yet he still manages to keep his faith in humanity and fight for the side of good. This is what makes him such an endearing hero. This movie waters everything down so much for the sake of a younger Hollywood audience it completely misses the essence of Wolverine the character. The berserker rage is all but gone, and the back story is so piece-mealed from different story arcs that the final result is pretty damn lame. The coolest part of the movie are the war scenes in the beginning, and they last a total of about three minutes.<br/><br/>As much as they failed with delivering Wolverine's back story, to me the biggest travesty here is the utter demolition of one of the coolest characters in the Marvel universe: Deadpool. WHAT THE F***? How could they have ruined Deadpool any further than this? After starting out strong in the beginning, the guy has turned into a poor man's version of SuperSkrull with Cyclop's eye beams, teleportation and swords coming out of his arms?! how can he even bend at the elbow with those things? To add insult to injury there's a spin-off movie in the works... UGH! Basically, all of the fan's gripes are warranted and I simply added to the list. All in all I was entertained, but very mixed in my feelings - this movie could have been WAY better if the writers weren't afraid to take chances in the RIGHT way, not recreating and rewriting something that was great to begin with.<br/><br/>In summary: ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."""

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine Review <br/><br/>Ôøº <br/><br/>Director - Gavin Hood Cast- Hugh Jackman, Live Schreiber, Taylor Kitsch, Will.i.am, Ryan Reynolds, Dominic Monaghan Running Time- 107 minutes<br/><br/>So the Summer Movie Season begins, like Iron Man last Summer. Comic book movies hope to be the starting gun to an eventful few months in movie land. This one another form Marvel the company responsible for the majority of Superhero movies along with 20th Century Fox add X-Men Origins: Wolverine to the list of X-Men movies. This hoping to reignite the series after a disappointing 3rd installment in a once bright series and open up possible franchises for Fox who have thus far had a bad year at the box-office. Sadly whether it makes money or not (it will) is a huge letdown. This a prequel to the X-Men trilogy tells the story of Jimmy Logan/Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman). It shows how Wolverine became the clawed and fuzzy memoried mutant we came to love in the other movies. We begin in the year 1845 (Wolverine ages slowly due to his mutant powers). A short and pointless introduction to his brother ,Sabretooth/Victor Creed(Live Schreiber) , his father and a hilarious twist and Logan and his brother are off to fight in the Civil, First World, Second World and Vietnam Wars. They murder a military officer, are sentenced to firing squad survive and become members of a special mutant team run by the government, all in a matter of minutes. This is where the film runs in to its fair share of problems. They focus on some of the least interesting of the heroes where as the others are ordered to a back seat role. The most fascinating and arguably anticipated of the new team is Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) is given a small role that makes you wish it was his movie and not Wolverines. One thing that can be said is the movie is filled with action albeit mindless action at times. The writers couldn't seem to make up their mind on what to write about. A tragic romance story or a Powerful Superhero Film. What we end up with is a disgusting hybrid. They throw in too many plot twist. The answers to which have been seen already from the three X-Men movies any other twists are laughable. One could make the argument that the previous movies will not have been seen by some and in that case they may work but hardly interesting to the rest of the audience. Some redemption can be found in the films ending. Linking the 3 mile Island disaster to the climactic battle is quite clever. Yet the movie is not sure when to end. Even putting one of six short endings after the credits to tie up one of the characters. The other five are shown at different cinemas. So if you want to find out what happens to your favorite you have to see it elsewhere. Trust me its just easier to leave the beast be.<br/><br/>4/10"
"Scrat-Stitch","6","1","5","7 May 2009"," Could've been better...
","Let's start with something positive. ""Wolverine"" gets off to an extremely strong start. After a somewhat confusing scene that involves Wolverine's father, we are immediately treated to an opening credits montage that involves Wolverine and Viktor fighting in the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and finally Vietnam. The execution of this sequence is incredibly cool, even if it does bring to mind a similar montage found in ""Watchmen."" We then meet a much younger William Stryker, who immediately recruits Wolverine and Viktor into his ""special program"". Before you can even blink, we've met like seven new mutants, although it's somewhat hard to keep track of them all. Most notably, we meet Agent Zero, who can shoot guns really, really well, and Deadpool, who's very good with swords. <br/><br/>At this point, I was thinking, ""This movie is moving along at a terrific pace, and almost everything has been awesome so far. This is going to rock!"" Shortly after this sequence, though, Wolverine decides to leave Stryker's program...wait, what? Why did he leave Stryker's program? Haven't we known ever since ""X2"" that Wolverine and Stryker worked with each other for a long time and did many terrible things together? Why is Wolverine already eager to leave a program that requires him to get his claws dirty? Shouldn't that realization of the error of his ways come later on in the film, instead of in the first twenty minutes of it? Of course, we know from all of the trailers that a tragic love story is involved here, and that's what begins when Wolverine moves to Canada. The movie slows down *big time* here, and I'm not really talking about the romance so much as the pacing of the film in general. Nothing really ""happens"" as far as story is concerned until Stryker returns, and even after that it still takes a little while for things to get going again.<br/><br/>Obviously, something major happens involving Wolverine's girlfriend, and it makes Wolverine thirsty for revenge. He agrees to Stryker's plea for experimentation to be done on his body, and you know what happens next. I should note that while this sequence was pretty well done, it wasn't *quite* what I was hoping for, although my expectations for it were pretty high. I don't want to sound like I'm making a cry for the movie to be even more violent than it already was, but this is a moment that should've been slightly more horrific, slightly more grizzly. Instead, it's pretty much over before the audience has a chance to figure out exactly what is happening, and that's what makes it kinda disappointing.<br/><br/>Another thing: After Wolverine escapes from the lab when his transformation is complete, Stryker *immediately* wants to destroy him. And¬Öthat's it. He and Wolverine never really have the alleged ""relationship"" that was hinted at so strongly in ""X2."" Stryker wants to kill Wolverine, and Wolverine learns of this very quickly, and then Wolverine wants to kill both Stryker *and* the person responsible for the loss of his girlfriend. Obviously, Wolverine is going to learn a lesson about controlling his rage, but again, this happens very quickly, during a far too sentimental sequence in which Wolverine is taken in by...John and Martha Kent? I'm just kidding, of course, but they *looked* like John and Martha Kent. Or Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Take your pick.<br/><br/>Probably the main thing that got to me about the film was something that I hinted at earlier: Wolverine simply isn't ""bad"" enough in this film. In fact, he remains a pretty decent guy for the most part, craving for revenge aside. Only once does he kill a character under questionable circumstances, and that character happens to be a villain, and the movie doesn't really dwell on this at all. Again, I'm not trying to sound like I'm making a war cry for more blood, but given what we *know* about Wolverine's origins from the previous ""X-Men"" films, it *doesn't make sense* for Wolverine to be so...likable here.<br/><br/>The movie also doesn't take full advantage of some of its new characters. Deadpool basically leaves the film after his opening scene, despite being played *perfectly* by Ryan Reynolds (then again, a ""Deadpool"" spin-off is supposedly in production, so maybe I shouldn't be complaining). More importantly, fan favorite Gambit doesn't come into play until the last third. He's awesome whenever he's on camera, but then he goes away for no real reason shortly after being introduced. As for Emma Frost, blink and you'll miss the 15 seconds that she's on camera. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that, either.<br/><br/>By now, I'm probably sounding as though I hated the movie, Which isn't the case here. I found plenty to enjoy, and when ""Wolverine"" is cool, it's *really* cool, especially during a chase scene that involves Wolverine on a motorcycle and a wonderfully inventive climatic fight scene that features Weapon XI (I won't spoil anything about him).<br/><br/>But what ""Wolverine"" ultimately fails to do is make much of an impact on the ""X-Men"" universe in general. It does what it needs to do (sort of), but it doesn't really satisfy the audience's craving for knowledge on Wolverine's background, either because of execution or stuff that it just doesn't explain ( it's never touched upon that Victor will become Sabortooth in the future). This is easily my least favorite film in the franchise, and that includes ""The Last Stand,"" which I actually consider to be rather underrated. I'm aware that many would probably disagree with me when I say this, but Wolverine's final standoff with Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix and the end of that film is one of *the* most powerful moments found in *any* superhero movie. Nothing in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" comes even close to having that kind of an emotional impact...which is a shame, considering that it probably could've if certain things about it had just been handled differently."
"david__T","5","1","5","7 May 2009"," A rehash of the X-Men Trilogy!
","This film was a major let down. Whilst it was interesting to see a few new characters, the main story overlapped far too much with the X-men trilogy. There are enough flash backs and back story given in those films that explained Wolverine's transformation - we didn't need a rehash of that. When clips where shown VERY briefly of the world wars I thought to myself: ""Those are the films that I want to see"". Instead we are teased by those and then treated to lots of story that we have already seen before. My other main gripe after the story is the bemusing certificate of 12A given to this film. Wolverine is one of the most violent of the comic book heroes and the BBFC (and to a lesser extent MPA) has a real thing about stabbing weapons. To release a film like this where fights regularly take place between a character with stabbing claws and one with stabbing nails is silly if you are not going to give it the age rating that it deserves. This should be in Sin City / 300 territory or at the very least should be a 15 cert here in the UK. There was a similar problem in LOTR & Transformers with very choppy editing to ""hide"" the gory moments but they had a good story and characters to make that more forgivable. Here we want to see Wolverine kick some comic book a$$, and I didn't think the film did enough to portray his violent side. Whether that was age rating or story driven, I will leave that up to you to decide... Hugh Jackman is great in the lead role and some of the effects are OK which is why this gets an average 5/10 from me. Overall - Could Do Better."
"The_Dead_See","3","1","5","6 May 2009"," A fun ending doesn't make up entirely for the mess that precedes it
","Wolverine was like a sandwich made with good bread but poor filling. The opening and closing sequences were tasty, but the middle was pretty much an inedible waste of time.<br/><br/>I'm not a big comic book reader so I can't comment on the accuracy (or lack thereof) of characters like Gambit or Deadpool. Whether they are done well or not is the least of the films worries. What i can say is this: Gone is the brash, bold Logan of the first movies - replaced by a rather bland ""all round nice guy"" that's just not as fun to watch and far too predictable.<br/><br/>None of the character motivations seem to make much sense... People are good guys one minute, bad guys the next, good guys again the next - without any truly believable concrete events to signal such changes in behaviour.<br/><br/>Finally we're served up a hackneyed love affair subplot that's like a one-dimensional cardboard copy of every other romance plot out there. It's not fresh or engaging and the audience is consistently one step ahead of what's going to happen. Worse, there's no chemistry between the leads to suggest that they are really in love.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Ryan Reynolds was great... for the three or four minutes he's in the movie, that is. Liev Schreiber looked like he was the only one having any fun and so managed to energize his portions of the movie and elevate them above the general blah of the other scenes. The sfx are impressive and the action scenes deliver on the high pace, but sadly without any depth or rationale to the characters the movie falls flat. It's definitely the worst of the series so far."
"hipcheck","6","1","5","4 May 2009"," What did you expect? That will answer your questions.
","Being an X-Men fan since the early 1980's, I was bound to see this movie. Hearing about the generally terrible reviews, my expectations were sufficiently low coming in. What did I expect -- not Tolstoy, not Kurosawa. What I got was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Film reviews are becoming less and less critical (pardon the pun) to a film's success, especially when you consider those for genre films. There are plenty of people who will always review a horror film as terrible, for example. And most critics are not fans of the superhero genre, save those they grew up with, perhaps Christopher Reeve's first couple. Are they going to like ""Wolverine""? Not likely, and not important to anyone else's enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>This is a summer blockbuster, and it works just fine. It does not, in fact, have gaping plot holes, terrible inconsistencies or many of the other easy targets that we're hearing about. Did these people see the first three (if we include the Brett Ratner misfire)? People are going to see this movie mostly for the action and the actors, but there is actually quite a good deal going on beneath the surface -- for the genre fans.<br/><br/>If you don't like superheroes, why would you bother going to see something like this in the first place? Don't. If you're an X-Men/Wolverine fan, it doesn't matter what other people think, you're going to see it. But for anyone else in between, just temper your expectations within the genre, perhaps do some background reading on who the characters are (you should know who Gambit, Deadpool and The Blob are, for example), and maybe even try to find some friends to go with who are genre fans.<br/><br/>Within the genre, it's honestly not bad. A step up from X-Men 3, a good deal better than Daredevil and Punisher, but really not close to X-Men 2 or The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Finally, if you haven't seen the original three of the series, it's quite fine to see this one first, you won't get any spoilers from Wolverine."
"SophomoreSlump","5","1","5","1 May 2009"," Great Story; Poor Storytelling
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Logan a.k.a. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who grows up as a mutant who can regenerate himself and has bone claws sheath in his hands. He kills the man who killed his father before finding out that the murderer was his real father. His brother, Victor a.k.a. Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber), ran away with him. They stick together until they're adults and fought in countless wars throughout the ages before ultimately joining a team of mutants a man named Stryker (Danny Huston) put together. This team however is not what Wolverine thought they would be and left. Six years passed, and Stryker comes up to Logan with a favour to ask because most of the team members are found dead. And that's pretty much the basic storyline.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The storyline itself. This prequel and spin-off is what fans of the franchise had been waiting for. It supposedly answer the question about Wolverine origins that was brought up in X-Men 2. The acting is also a good aspect of this movie. Hugh Jackman really embraces the character Wolverine and he really unleashes his anger so powerfully that we can feel his rage. Schreiber makes a good animalistic Sabretooth that would hunt down anything he is pointed at. And Ryan Reynolds got Deadpool spot on with some witty lines and great action scene. The action sequence is another factor. The fight scenes are only a few minutes in length, but it was good while it lasted.<br/><br/>THE BAD: The CGI looks very cheap! It looks like they started it well (the opening credits was real art) but then fell short on money. Never had I seen Wolverine claws look so fake. The teleportation ability by Wraith (Will.i.Am) looks like something from the 80's sci-fi. What happened to the way Nightcrawler teleports in X2 (which was a CGI masterpiece)? And furthermore, just like in X-Men 3, a lot of characters are killed of pre-maturely and/or badly casted. And although I said the story itself is good, the way it is being told is not. They didn't make good use of the flashbacks, or twist or anything that will keep the suspense. None of the scenes are as dramatic as they should have been.<br/><br/>THE BOTTOM LINE: X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a movie that only fans should see. It's no where near X2, but good enough if you just want to know about Wolverine's past."

Then I started hearing that it wasn't very good and my expectations dropped, thus when i saw it i wasn't absurdly disappointed.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie was its lazy script. It possessed none of the dry humor of Wolverine from the other movies and some dialog was just too dry and simple when it could have been more finely suited to the characters.<br/><br/>Some characters were good ad did not get enough screen time, such as Wade Wilson and Gambit. While others who should not have been too extremely accentuated were. Overall I would just say there were too many characters and some should have had their screen time cut down.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the budget or something else but some of the CGI was just terrible, such as his animated claws... I mean, what the neck was that? Just stick with the real stuff like the other movies, also when hacking at the fire escape to trap Gambit, that was sickening it was so cheesy... Though some was very good, like the cyclopes eye blast, the wraith teleporting, and Gambit's awesome stunts. <br/><br/>I liked it, it was fun, I might even buy it just to complete my collection. It's not the gem of Marvel as it could have been, and I would put it as Marvel middle ground, above things like Fantastic 4, Daredevil, Ghost Rider... But not as good as Marvel's best; Iron Man, X-Men 2, Spiderman 2 and The Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>See it if you want to have some fun, but don't go looking for something amazing."

","Perhaps the biggest failure was the fact that the writers (David Benioff and Skip Woods) and the director (Gavin Hood) gave only a cursory glance at the source material, made the assumption that its content was either too deep or too intelligent for movie-goers, and proceeded to wipe their respective asses with it. Then they listened to the fans who wanted to see all of their favorite characters in the movie, listened to the top dogs at Marvel who loved the marketing opportunities (like the line of action figures for the movie) and then threw every mutant with a recognizable name that hadn't already been in X3: the Brett Ratner POS...and they even threw in a few who were unfortunate enough to have been in that dung heap of a film.<br/><br/>So, my favorite comic book character (Deadpool - the Merc with the Mouth) gets screwed to hell with no chance for a spin off film, and we got a junk flick with a meandering plot, no character development, and no value whatsoever.

","This was actually the first ""X-Men"" movie I ever saw. I saw it in theaters back in 2009 on my birthday. I thought it was awesome when I first saw it, but that was when I didn't have much taste. Upon rewatching it after developing critical thinking skills, I realize that this movie is pretty bad.<br/><br/>There are many things that this movie disappointingly glossed over. The first few minutes showing Logan's childhood and the montage with Logan and Victor fighting in various wars each could have honestly been their own movies, but both sequences were only a few minutes long.<br/><br/>Another issue is that, like ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" it had far more characters than it knew what to do with. Gambit was awesome but was totally wasted and there were other characters that felt unnecessary. The worst thing about this movie is what they infamously did to Deadpool: they sewed his mouth shut. He is supposed to be ""The Merc With The Mouth"" and they sew his mouth shut?! Really?!<br/><br/>The film's story doesn't make much sense and there are many things that leave you scratching your head. Why do they try to kill Wolverine when they know they just made him indestructible? Why did Wolverine no longer want to kill Stryker after finding out that it was a set up and his wife was in on it? Why didn't the captured mutants just use their superpowers to escape from the cages?<br/><br/>The action scenes are poorly staged and shot and shown from many random angles. The cutting an ""X"" in the wall scene and the walking away from explosion scene were both shoehorned into the movie just so they could be used for the trailer. The CGI is also surprisingly lackluster.<br/><br/>The only things that save this movie are the leads. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber were both excellent as Wolverine and Sabertooth respectively, and the nature of their relationship is very interestingly played out.<br/><br/>This is one of the worst comic book movies out there. Even die-hard ""X-Men"" fans don't need to bother with this one. This is easily the worst of the series, but at least it lead to the series being taken in a different direction that made it better.<br/><br/>RATING: D"

This is what you get for your Yen, Pound and Dollar. This is no bad policy in itself but at the expense of what in particular?

Basically that time has been stolen from my life and i will never get it back which i cant forgive myself or the film makers for.<br/><br/>Practically every character in the film being different to the original xmen films apart from Hugh Jackman. Its like they didn't think continuity mattered or the story either for that matter. I don't remember sabertooth being able to heal / live forever as he was obviously killed in Xmen 1 so why in this is he able to heal and stay alive is that not wolverines power not Sabertooth.<br/><br/>The Film is trash, continuity was out the window and the story writers must not have been paid any overtime as they didn't put much effort into this film or possibly they got a chimp to write it instead. Don't waste any time on this, wait till it hits commercial TV and you can at least watch it for free and then change channel and not feel ripped off or your time wasted."

","Let me start off by saying I love the x-men movies and the x-men comics so going into this movie i had BIG expectations for it,I wanted to love this movie but what i got was complete and utter disappointment,It wasn't just one single thing that ruined it for me but a bunch of things and i shall explain.I understand that when transferring a comic book or any piece of literature or novel for that matter to the big screen sometimes details are left out and i am OK with that,The first three x-men movies details were either left out or changed(did you see the third one???) But with WOLVERINE it was the opposite,The makers of this movie decided to take the story of the most popular X-MAN and twist it into there own idea Which is bad call number one when you are dealing with WOLVERINE.Here are my reasons i did not like this movie: 1.So the story starts in 1845 northwest territories Canada???? These territories did not become a part of Canada intill 1870,but we are not here for the historical inaccuracies so lets move on.<br/><br/>2.The acting in this movie was pretty good.Hugh Jackman IS wolverine,and liev schreiber even though looks nothing like sabretooth is supposed to look like did a fantastic job in being the villain.But for all the good acting it was foiled but a script that was weak and had one too many plot holes.<br/><br/>3.It felt like to me they only introduced characters in this movie to one day spring them for there own origin movie in the future.<br/><br/>4.Cyclops was and always will be a whiny little girl.<br/><br/>5.The most anticipated x-man gambit got very little screen time and sounded nothing like gambit<br/><br/>Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers<br/><br/>6.wolverine and sabretooth are not brothers!!!! enough said that is a complete perversion of the x-men story.and why would wolverine not remember any of these events come the first x-men movie???? Oh he gets shot with Adamantuim bullets that cause him to lose his memory...... But sabretooth did'nt get shot, so he should remember when they meet again in the first x-men movie right?????? And the fact also that we had little storm and little nightcrawler in this movie but they don't remember wolverine in the future no no no of course not.<br/><br/>Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers<br/><br/>7.The thing that most annoyed me the most is the fact they took deadpool(Who i was very excited to see) and twisted is character completely around.Ryan Reynolds did a good job playing him, but since when did deadpool become weapon whatever the hell number and gained all these powers???? It never happened like that, oh and the whole swords coming out of his arm bullshit don't even go there with that Hollywood.<br/><br/>This movie was a major disappointment to me and i feel the x-men series in cinema is officially dead.But we all know Hollywood will give everyone there own origin story in the near future.Don't go see this in theaters..... save your money and redbox it.<br/><br/>my official score for this movies is 3 stars out of ten"

","Very minor spoilers...<br/><br/>Alright folks, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a basic superhero action movie. It's filled with tons of special effects and great fight scenes. So why so many negative reviews?<br/><br/>People are arrogant, plain and simple. Some of the reviews I have read are clearly from those who think they are on a different level of intellect than the rest of the world. Who cares about relationship development in a superhero movie? The reason films like these are constructed is to blow you away with action, which this one delivers. <br/><br/>They throw you into Wolverine's life. It doesn't unveil much about the beginning of his exploits, you just kind of go with what they give you. But this is the part that I don't quite understand why people care. Honestly who is concerned with Wolverine's relationship with his family as a child. I chose to view this movie for the simple fact that it is packed with Wolverine going to town on people with his claws. <br/><br/>Liev Schreiber made an excellent villain. Along with Hugh Jackman I thought the acting was right on par. I was hoping Ryan Reynolds would be more involved, but will.i.am was entertaining in his absence. <br/><br/>Gambit was also a nice surprise to see. The mutants on display in this movie were fun to watch. If you liked the X-Men movies, hopefully you will enjoy this as well. Of course it's predictable, but it's still a great watch. If you're looking for a ridiculous plot with surprises everywhere and Emmy winning writing go watch something else."

","Wolverine ! one of my favourite marvel super heroes .how could Hollywood spoil such a favourite marvel hero. just to make a quick buck on its popularity? i wonder?..yes. i would like to express that i'm extremely disappointed with the movie. firstly, its the storyline. so bland and uninteresting. well... exceptions for the part where he was being filled with adamantium..the movie has no proper plot build up. everything seems so rushed and messy. secondly is the logic of the film. my gosh.. what age group does this film fall under. below 5 ??? i was laughing all the way through. so childish!. i agree superhero movies tend to be a little off the realism factor but this ! i just can't simply comprehend. the way wolverine uses his new claws to exact revenge is so funny and on top of that the seriousness of the movie with the lack of logic. hilarious! and the most disappointing part is the ending, the part with Deadpool. god bless deadpool.. that character's fame was abused to the brink of destruction. well... now i'm pretty happy that i managed to vent out my disappointment for the movie. it's at least something to supplement my wasted RM12. My only advise , watch the movie with part of your thinking shut down. i'll be easier to digest all the crap unlike what i did, my mistake was to think too much during the movie.. movie's a great eye candy though. at least there's something to do with friends."

","Oh my god. After hearing that Hugh Jackman was beside himself due to the rough cut of this movie being pirated, I braced myself for what I thought was going to be an excellent marvel movie. No no no. This movie is a inglorious mix of different wolverine legends and marvel characters. I was hoping for the same kind of dark magic woven in ""X-Men 2"", but I got something like ""Elektra"" instead. As a bit of a comic book geek, I feel that marvel's key demographic should be pandered to a little more. Character's should be treated with a little more respect, and a little continuity wouldn't kill anyone. Here's whats annoying: Who the hell was Sabertooth in the first ""X-Men"" movie? Much of Dead Pool's appeal lies in the fact that he's a wise cracking psychopath, his mouth is surgically shut and he's a zombie in this flick> Why are Logan and Victor enemies if he didn't kill his wife? The old couple really didn't have it coming, plus its hard to care. I'm just whining at this point. Its a terrible movie, the special effects don't save it, sorry Hugh. PANTS"

","Some movies can be so bad that you wonder why it was made in the first place. Melba once said of the public, ""give the muck"" Muck is served up in this shambles with abandon. The feeble plot is meant to give us an idea about the beginning of the character played by Hugh Jackman. I quite liked the other movies but this is all over the place. The special effects are as we predicted, special, but the movie is not backed up with any talent. The normally wonderful Hugh Jackman puts on a terrible American accent and wanders around the movie looking rather like a constipated poodle. Someone should put him on a leash and take him to the nearest Broadway stage. One wishes this fine performer would get back to musicals which he does better than any one. Maybe a few show tunes would help this mess. Hugh is not the worse actor in the movie because that distinction goes to the hopeless Liev Schrieber who has about as much screen presence as a block of wood. He grunts and mumbles and you hope a vet will put the poor sod down. Julia Blake and Max Cullen are dreadful in thankfully minor roles. You actually start feeling as though you want to cheer when the annoying old bag snuffs it. It is dreadful. The effects are good but play the video game instead."

","After the utter failure of X-Men: The Last Stand, Fox decided to change their plans for the franchise. Instead of having sequels, they would have origin stories based on individual characters. I believe that they originally planed to have an X-Men Origins: Magneto film as well. However, these plans were soon dropped, for reasons we'll soon get into.<br/><br/>Let's start with the story. We have a rushed beginning that messily sets up the plot. The relationship of Wolverine and Sabertooth are given only a couple of scenes before they become enemies. There's a decent heist action sequence at first. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as Deadpool in the first scene he's in. But it quickly becomes bad after that.<br/><br/>Wolverine decides to retire, get married, and live an idle life. Then his wife gets killed by his brother (Sabertooth). This feels rushed as well, because we're only given one scene with them together, and so it's hard to feel that emotional. The rest of the movie is Wolverine being hunted down and him trying to get revenge.<br/><br/>I won't get into the entire plot since it's way to complicated. Wolverine jumps from one location to another, making the story feel all over the place and unfocused. Gambit appears in the film as well, only to leave after five minutes. The CGI is especially terrible. As anyone would have told you back then, it looked bad in 2009, and it's gone worse with time.<br/><br/>When you stop to think about it, you realize this movie was kind of pointless. We already know Wolverine's backstory, and nothing else of importance is achieved. None of new characters in this film return later, and Wolverine himself forgets everything at the end. It feels like pointless filler. Really bad filler.<br/><br/>The movie was so poorly received that the studio decided to scrap their plans for the 'X-Men: Origins' series, even though it made a decent amount of money at the box office. But it's quite a useless movie in the long run. If you're going to watch the entire X-Men franchise, it'll probably be best to leave this one out."

","It's 10 times better then the Wolverine 2013. X-Men Origin: Wolverine has more actions and cutting and better story then the Wolverine, which I think is overrated through visual effects and japanisque blend, even though they fail to deliver proper action/sword/cutting choreography. And I watched the Unleashed Edition that suppose to be uncut and with actual blood visual. The theatrical was a joke, when Wolverine cuttings its was as if he was punch, bad guys were flying off.

Seeking solace from his dark past, Logan (Hugh Jackman), better known as Wolverine, seems to have found love and contentment with Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Logan's peaceful existence is shattered when Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), his vicious brother, brutally murders Kayla. Logan's thirst for revenge propels him into the Weapon X program, where he undergoes a painful procedure to bond his bones with adamantium, making him virtually indestructible and more than a match for Victor."
"cashbacher","8","0","2","26 August 2019"," Mutant powers enhanced by science
","Wolverine likely has the most volatile, dynamic personality of all the X-Men. While he is a mutant in the sense that he has incredible recuperative powers, the physically indestructible characteristics of his powers derived from metal were made by science not nature. As is often the case with stories like this, they are the consequences of a secret government program to create a super soldier. In such stories, it is necessary to have a powerful and ruthless villain that is the government agent overseeing the program. This story has that character.
Logan has a brother that shares his recuperative powers and the opening has them fighting side-by-side in many wars. When the major wars are over and the only fighting to be done is for hire, the two brothers join a mercenary band of mutants. They track down the Earth point of origin of a meteor and when the order is to slaughter all the inhabitants of a village in Africa, Logan walks away from the mission and the group. He ""retires"" to a logging job in Canada, but as expected, there is no retirement from his previous line of work.
There is a great deal of action, a lot of subterfuge and some superb special effects. The government program involves the capture and control of many mutants, which leads to the major logical hole in the plot. Professor Xavier appears to take them to his special school only after they have all been released from government control. Which implies that Xavier either did not know of their imprisonment or did so and waited until they were freed. Both of which are logically untenable given Xavier's significant mental powers.
That weakness aside, this is an action movie derived from the comics that remains true to the original story. It also explains Logan's attitude towards the world and his having no memory of his past."

","Since I loved the first two X-Men movies, I was rather disappointed with the third one. My expectations weren't that high after hearing the harsh reception X-Men: Wolverine had got, so maybe that's why I haven't been so hard on it.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed it a little more than The Last Stand which is kind of odd, because Wolverine is my favorite X-Man and he has an awesome origin story which sadly isn't really that well handled in here.<br/><br/>There are some crucial things wrong which makes this less of an origin story and more like a handful of ideas never really fleshed out to its full potential. The opening scene establishes the brotherhood of Logan and Victor, but that is abandoned and only visited in the way we already know Logan. What origin story?<br/><br/>Logan gets into some relationships which are important to his persona, but that aspect isn't used the way it should in AN ORIGIN STORY! You don't see him developing his well known self after being affected by episodes in his life, the writers just set up a lot of things and later paying them off in not very effective ways.<br/><br/>I didn't find X-Men Origins: Wolverine insufferable as a movie, even though I know how many reviewers with more expieriance than me have stated the opposite, but I was sufficiently entertained by some of the performances like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston and that was a better waste of time than the mostly hollow performances from The Last Stand.<br/><br/>All in all, as an origin story it falls flat, but as an action flick it's okay."
"tabuno","7","0","1","20 January 2019"," Solid but Not Spectacular
","2 May 2009. Perhaps its the medium of film, but oddly enough, X-Men Origins: Wolverine just can't compete with the newer medium of television. Take the television series ""Heros"" which can extend any plot or character by multiple times over a number of years and a single movie even if its a prequel, it can't compete except supposedly for the special effects and big budget expenditures. The action is decent, the plot commendable if not perhaps falling trap to its own devices. Wolverine leaves some questions unanswered, uses plot twists to manipulate the audience's emotions from laughter to anger and back to sympathy. The problem with this movie is that in its effort to surprise the audience, keep it off-balanced, the plot itself becomes part of the problem as the twists and turns become themselves unlikely and unreasonable, if not emotional surprising and gyrating. This action-adventure feels derivative, with a lot of the action just a rehash of the same, some of special effects even seeming to be over to top and not comfortably believable even in the realm of big blockbuster movies. The effort in inject emotional intimacy, connections is also commendable, but not always successful. The brother relationship always felt awkward. Those innocent bystanders who get killed also seem more or less token plot devices. Overall, this is an enjoyable blockbuster, if not superbly accomplished or establishing any sort of classic status. 7/10."

","Following the success of X-Men 3: The Last Stand, it was only a matter of time before 20th Century Fox would greenlight a spin-off movie featuring the X-Men's most popular character, Wolverine. With Gavin Hood who had already directed the Oscar-winning film, Tsotsi directing along with a script written by David Benioff and featuring the likes of Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber and Ryan Reynolds, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was shaping up to be a great movie. However, it was overseen by Fox chairman, Tom Rothman. Known for his dislike of genre movies, Rothman was determined to destroy Hood's vision at every turn. The two crashed continuously over the direction of the movie as Hood wanted a more dark and gloomy movie in line with the comics while Rothman wanted a fast-paced and kid-friendly film that would pull in high returns akin to the MCU. This got so bad that Hood apparently left the production of the film after Rothman repainted an entire set. With no one to finish shooting the movie, an unnamed ghost director was brought in, supposedly Richard Donner. The final film did perform well at the box office despite a workprint being leaked online but the critical and fan reactions were far from kind and the movie represents a dark spot on the resumes of all of those evolved. <br/><br/>Now, my first exposure to X-Men Origins: Wolverine came when I first saw a few TV spots for it back in the spring of 09' and while I was impressed by what I saw, I decided to pass on seeing it as comic book movies weren't my thing back in those days. I didn't watch the film until late in 2016 in preparation for seeing Logan so I watched the movie and to my surprise, I didn't find it to be nearly as awful as some of the fans had labeled it as there were certain things I enjoyed like the action scenes and some of the acting, but the story, writing, characters, and tone left a lot to be desired in my eyes.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1845 where we met young James Howlett who witnesses his supposed father being murdered by a groundskeeper. The angst caused by this activated Howlett's mutation where bone claws grow from the boy's knuckles and he straight-up kills the man only to have the groundskeeper reveal that he is James's biological father. Soon after, Howlett fees with the help of his half-brother, Victor Creed. The two spend the next century fighting in The Civil War, both World Wars and The Vietnam War where Victor is arrested for attempting to abuse a woman and he and James are thrown in jail. They are then approached by Major William Stryker and are offered membership in a mutant team. The two join the group for a few years but after seeing the group's as well as Victor's lack of compassion for human life, Logan quits the group and leaves. The film then skips ahead 6 years later where Wolverine now has a girlfriend and works as a logger. Later, Stryker approaches him and asks for his help in stopping Victor but Logan isn't interested until his girlfriend is killed. Now, Wolverine must find and kill Victor to avenge his girlfriend's death while Striker is working on a potently deadly experiment.<br/><br/>With all the production troubles the movie was subjected to and how the final film was received by the general public and professional critics, X-Men Origins: Wolverine comes across as more of a haphazard attempt to tell the backstory of the most popular character in the entire X-men roster rather than trying to tell a compelling and complex story which should be the focal point of any movie but due to the various reshoots the film went through, it seems that what we got was very slapdash and poorly put together. Much like another superhero film released in 2009, Watchmen, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a film that comes along to surely pander to people who aren't familiar with the character or his source material. But in spite of that, the film, unlike Watchmen, feels the need to forgo it's source material and carelessly neuter and re-draw the context of who the character of Wolverine is with an icily dislike for what he stands for and instead opts to destroy one of the most authentically complex, revolutionary and terrifying superhero backstories since Batman into one of the most inferior kinds of watered-down, mundane and PG-rated money-making garbage ever to grace the silver screen. <br/><br/> At the very least, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a film that recognizes how pointless it really is as Wolverine's backstory has already been shown to us in the first two X-men films so none of the events that take place in X-Men Origins: Wolverine have any tangible sense of relevance on the character growth of Wolverine or the other characters for that matter. The viewer understands that by watching the film, everything Wolverine will attain will eventually be removed from his memory and forgotten about with the movie serving only as a mere action-packed memory which, even if something had presented itself and was worth speaking, it would have been fruitless to say anything regardless no matter how much one might want to. Those filmgoers or comic book fans looking for the moralistic and complex character arch that Bryan Singer gave Wolverine in the first two X-Men movies and Days of Future Past as well as what James Mangold did on The Wolverine and Logan or what Bret Ratner tried but failed to do on X-Men 3 will be severely let down by what X-Men Origins: Wolverine does to him. <br/><br/>Though the movie takes place in the 70s and 80s as well as being a prequel to the first three X-Men films, it sadly doesn't give us the glimpse into that world in its foundational years. One would think that this new group of people evolving at this time in history and with the Civil Rights Moment going on at that, you would think that Hood, as well as Benioff and Woods and even Rothman, would want to explore that aspect of who the X-men and Wolverine represent. In lieu of that, however, the movie doesn't seem to any interest in exploring such lofty ideals. As a matter of fact, it appears that there have always been mutants in the previous X-men films, at best centered around the plethora of supporting metahumans, so it really doesn't make a lick of sense why the US and Canadian governments are all of a sudden alarm in the 20 years in the future. If anything, the metahuman population is declining rather than increasing. <br/><br/>But to make such conclusions would be detracting as it is scathing to pick apart loads of little inconsistencies and moronic ideas that the writers and Tom Rothman injected into the finished movie or the incredibly lazy storytelling where the screenplay attempts to try and link X-Men Origins: Wolverine to the previous three X-Men movies much, in the same manner, the Star Wars prequels or the last previous James Bond film do in order to work rather than standing on its own. There's absolutely zero inspiration here in the screenwriting, no joy of life and no fun. Nothing here feels natural or emotional like in some of the other Marvel movies like Spiderman 2 or Avengers: Infinity War. The story simply isn't broad enough to ensure that it'll be taken purposefully, but it's also too nervous to be an all-out fun superhero movie due to the crashing tones set by Rothman's micromanaging. There's also nothing here to add to the character of Wolverine as what is interesting about him has already been explored in the last three movies as well as in Days of Future Past and the two later Wolverine films so this retelling of his backstory feels incredibly unnecessary and run-of-the-mill. It would be forgivable if the movie had tried to add something new to Logan's backstory to make it interesting but it sadly doesn't and all we're left with is a piss-poor origins story lacking any real character's for the viewer to care about or a compelling hero we can symphonize with. <br/><br/>Of course, the film's problems don't stop there as even the CGI looks lazy and half-assed notably with Logan's claws which one would think that they would have been matured over the last three movies. They look like someone just colored them in, and feel like a vast departure from the visual effects that had been used back in 2002 for the first Spiderman film or the effects used in Dr. Strange. In a movie that almost recommends the viewer to suspend the notion of reality for even a simple story to function, it requires great effects to assure the viewer that a helicopter could be parked amongst some trees or that Wolverine is actually diving into some water. The effects here look so bad that they make the effects in Justice League look like Richard Donner's Superman. <br/><br/>Also, given how the movie is only an hour and 59 minutes long, it does seem to not focus on Wolverine's origins for too long as after about 10 minutes of seeing James Howlett as a child, we are then thrown into a montage of him and Victor fighting in several wars. This just highlights again how paper-thin the plot and characters are. So far, we've had very little investment in the character of Wolverine and even less investment in Victor Creed. All we know about the two when we are first introduced to them is that Logan is traumatized due to him killing his father who we never saw him share many scenes with Logan let alone give us any reason to care for him getting skewered by his son and that Victor hates humans even though we never see him attack or try to kill any, we're just told that he hates them making his motives unclean throughout the entire film. Also poorly developed is Wolverine's relationship with his girlfriend and somehow becomes even less authentic by the end. In one scene that is supposed to develop Wolverine and Kayla's romantic relationship, all we get is some bizarre Native American myth about the moon which comes across as dull and randomly comical. Oh, and if this wasn't nonsensical enough, Kayla is, in fact, a mutant so she's mesmerizing Logan in order watch him for Striker, and she the forges her death so that Wolverine will then go aft"

","‚ÄãPlot Overview: Years after leaving a military task force, Logan(Hugh Jackman) must join back the action again when his girlfriend is murdered as his brother resurfaces.<br/><br/>Directed by Gavin Hood<br/><br/>Starring ‚ÄãHugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber and Danny Huston<br/><br/># NO SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Overall: I love Wolverine as a character and I love Hugh Jackman's portrayal of him. I do NOT love this travesty of a film. There are no redeeming qualities here and I don't say that lightly. Even Jackman phones it in and that is kinda upsetting due to the commitment he's shown this character over the years. Sadly, this isn't even a film that you can watch while drunk and poke fun at. It takes itself way too seriously and that makes even poking fun at it impossible due to tone. <br/><br/>The people who like this movie will be people who like the dark, depressing, joyless type of superhero film. <br/><br/>Wouldn't Recommend.<br/><br/># POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman phones it in throughout this and that is genuinely sad because of how long he's been dedicated to this character so this was clearly due to lack of faith in the film. Ryan Reynolds was NOT Deadpool and anyone who defends that absolute travesty should be publicly executed. Like this movie however you want; I don't care but don't call that abomination 'The Merc WITH A MOUTH'. He wasn't and thank God Reynolds got hit shot at redemption. Liev Schreiber was awful as as Sabretooth and I would even say Tyler Mane did a better job, and that is saying something. Taylor Kitsch was bad as Gambit and the character was completely wasted. Lynn Collins was bad as Silver Fox. Danny Huston was horrific as William Stryker but I suppose he couldn't have competed with Brian Cox. Despite this, a bad performance is still a bad performance. Will.I.Am was bad as John Wraith.<br/><br/>The story was a lazy, poorly written mess. Gavin Hood followed a step by step guide(written by Joel Schumacher and Pitof) on how to totally screw up a comic book movie. It was lazy, twists didn't work and it was just plain dull.<br/><br/>One scene in the movie was decently shot and that is when Wolverine uses his claws to turn around a motorbike. Other than that, action was horribly shot and everything else was terribly shot. <br/><br/>The effects were abysmal and they SEWED 'THE MERC WITH A MOUTH's MOUTH SHUT!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie failed to give a good origin story, failed to provide good action and made Hugh Jackman phone it in.<br/><br/>The music was trash in this movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I absolutely despise this movie and I think it is one of the worse movies I've watched.<br/><br/>1/10"

","The worst X-Men film to date disrupts the continuity and relays the tale of how Logan became Wolverine. I've been more forgiving of this film as I was not as familiar with the canon comics on which it was based. When I first saw the film, I was not aware of the bone claws that are a part of Wolverine's origin. They look awful in the film but so do most of the special effects trying to make something big off a limited budget. Gavin Hood directs this action-adventure that touches some other X-men superhero but disappoints at nearly every turn.<br/><br/>The film begins with a young James Howlett who is sickly and unknowing of his true lineage. His half-brother Victor helps him discover his true father and the boys flee after James discovers his bone claws and murders his dad. They run through wars as they grow to manhood as indestructible soldiers. In Vietnam, they are accused of turning on their old platoon. Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) agree to work for General Stryker (Danny Huston) who is forming a superteam. The rest of the mutants on Stryker team are the teleporter John Wraith (Will.i.am), Wade (Ryan Reynolds), Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand), Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), and Agent Zero (Daniel Henney). <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","The thing that really bugs me about Gavin Hood's X-Men Origins: Wolverine - other than the terrible script, bad directing, and godawful effects - is the fact that it had every right to be great. The story is there and the character of Wolverine has a fantastic past that they were going to explore. They didn't however just make a bad superhero movie, they made one of the worst movies of all time here.<br/><br/>If you were to ask me about five years ago on my feelings towards this film, I would've told you it was entertaining as all hell and really good. Last year, after I got really into film, and I hadn't seen it in a few years, I decided to pop it in and see how I felt. I turned it off after 20 minutes because it was so bad. Leading up to Logan, I knew I had to revisit this and I actually made it through the entire thing without pulling my hair out.<br/><br/>The thing that truly makes this horrible is just how clumsy and lousy it all fails; there's no passion in it. Gavin Hood's direction is truly horrible. Shots are confusing and it didn't flow very well. The editing was all over place. There's even a part where Logan yells but Hugh Jackman's mouth is closed. Like what the actual hell is that?<br/><br/>The screenplay is even worse. Written by David Benioff & Skip Woods, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is cringeworthy at all times. The way the characters talk and the way that they are shown is so stupid and makes me roll my eyes a lot. The chemistry between everyone feels so bland and everyone - with the exception of one or two - looks like they don't wanna be there. It's a shame because they both had so much to work with and it all turned to waste.<br/><br/>This is where it really gets bad; the performances. You can't really fault Hugh Jackman's Logan/Wolverine because he scream and kills and it's nice, but the character depth he has in the original trilogy was way more interesting and way more grounded. Liev Schreiber is really the only thing that works for me. He's badass as Victor and truly makes this watchable to me. Ugh Ryan Reynolds. You're really bad in this, and annoying, but annoying as in not funny. I'm glad you got to redeem yourself, but this is really bad.<br/><br/>For the mere first ten minutes alone, and the rage-infused monster that is Victor Creed, is what I would say are the only good parts about this film. It's shameful in how much lore and knowledge there is on the character of Wolverine and we got this. Gavin Hood's X-Men Origins: Wolverine is one of the worst comic book films to this very date for its terrible direction and messy script. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone - expect those who are willing to sit through rubbish for fun."
"connorbbalboa","1","0","3","18 January 2017"," One of the few films I have a grudge against.
","Out of all the X-Men films that have come out over the past decade and a half, this is the worst one ever. I hate this movie with all my passion and I think it is undeserving to be in the X-Men canon. What angers me even more about it is that this film is based off a great origin story from the comics and it has been horribly tainted by just about everyone involved, except Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber.<br/><br/>The plot is basically retelling most of the important details about Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) origin, being discovering his bone claws as a child, fighting in different wars, his relationship with a Native American woman named Silverfox, his time on Team X and in Weapon X, getting the adamantium claws and his grudge against Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). Also, there are numerous things added that were never part of the origin that just come off as the movie trying to show off other characters for the sake of it. For instance, Blob was never part of Team X and yet he's on the team as a normal-looking guy, and later, he becomes the Blob and used as the butt of a lot of jokes, particularly in a boxing match he has with Wolverine so Wolvie can get info. from him. Wolvie really would have just threatened to cut him open if he was truly like his comic book counterpart or anything like he was in the previous films, not to mention that Wolvie's adamantium skeleton and healing factor would both be strong advantages. Also, Gambit, one of everyone's favorite X-Men (I never liked him) also appears, but it's only for a couple of short scenes and his role is incredibly inconsequential. That is the least of the problems here.<br/><br/>One major problem is the terrible special effects. Many are obviously computer-generated, and the contenders for the worst looking ones include the Patrick Stewart recreation and Wolverine's claws, which were a combination of practical and digital claws in the original trilogy. Usually, films with imperfect special effects can be forgiven if everything else in the film works. For instance, the effects in E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial are not ground-breaking, but because I loved the story, soundtrack, and the title character, I didn't care. However, the story and characters here are terrible, so there is no excuse.<br/><br/>The characters are also all expendable, from Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) to Silverfox. Most of the guys in Weapon X are just there to show off their ""cool"" powers like Agent Zero's agility, Wraith's (WILL.I.AM) teleportation, and Blob's resistance to gunfire. The scene with Team X raiding an African compound is a special offender in this category. So much time is made for showing off each of these guy's powers, Wolvie and Sabretooth don't get a chance to shine. In X2, it was implied that Wolvie was a much worse person than he eventually became when on Stryker's team, and the film fails to explore that completely. Because these guys on Team X are given no character beyond their bad-a$$ery and their powers, I don't care what happens to them. People say that Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson was the standout among them, but I don't think he was able to prove himself as that character until 2016's Deadpool. Lynn Collins as Silverfox in particular has some of the worst dialogue and acting in the film, and the fact that her (fake) death in the film is Wolverine's reason for getting his adamantium makes the whole thing much more clich√©.<br/><br/>A lot of the events in the film don't make sense either. Why does Stryker order his men to blow Wolvie up when Wolvie has a healing factor and the adamantium in his skeleton makes him nigh-indestructible? How does Gambit run back down the alleyway and run back the same way on a rooftop when Wolvie knocked him out before fighting Sabretooth? Why does Wraith try to kill Sabretooth with his bare hands when he knows that Sabretooth has a healing factor? Why is Wolvie reacting to his claws in amazement instead of agony like the X2 flashbacks clearly show? How do adamantium bullets erase Wolvie's memory? That is unacceptable. What does Stryker hope to accomplish by combining the powers of several mutants into Wade, especially when more powerful mutants like Magneto and Professor Xavier could defeat him? How does Wolvie and Sabretooth being brothers add anything to their grudge? Why can't Sabretooth survive the adamantium procedure but Wolvie can, even though they have the same powers? Why do Silverfox's powers work on Wolvie but not Sabretooth? Why? What? How? <br/><br/>The only good thing I can say about this movie is that despite being manipulated by the very poor script, Jackman and Schreiber do what they can with the characters of Wolvie and Sabretooth. Otherwise, this is a pile of junk that is so bad that even before the Days of Future Past retcon, the makers of this series started to forget its existence. It should have been more true to Wolverine's character and been a proper prequel to the original X-Men trilogy and NOT an advertisement for other characters and a poorly-written, clich√©d superhero movie. I give this movie the least amount of praise possible and condemn it for the rest of its existence."

","Writing this now, 7 years after this film was made, gives a better insight into what Marvel has been doing. They have their set of superheroes, long embedded in pop imagination, mostly through comic books and animation TV series. Now they talk about ""fictional universe"" which is a way to say they will explore each of those characters within their original specific family of characters, as well as mix them with other families and, as in this case, zoom in on certain individual characters.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that these decisions are based on popularity, ratings, market decisions. And Hollywood is today hostage to bigger and louder, more than ever. So there is no real narrative exploration, no filling of the spaces between the main branches. They just produce action stuff which is ordinary by any standard (visual, narrative etc.). Sometimes the film will be mildly interesting because of someone interesting they employ (Downey Jr, Swinton, Branagh...) but even there we just fill that each one could be doing something more interesting (and less lucrative). Other times they use what Downey Jr taught them in how he worked the Iron Man character: irony, winks, poking fun at the character, by deliberately stepping out of it. They learned the lesson and since than pretty much every film is conceived in such a way as not to take itself very seriously. So we have Dr.Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool... this last one actually has a cameo in this Wolverine mess.<br/><br/>What they did here was simple take a character (with whom Jackman is strongly associated) and just give it to us in high doses, more intense, more screen-time, more... Hugh Jackman has a strong enough presence to carry the thin character alone so they did it.<br/><br/>Because they have not much to say, nothing inventive to fill the narrative with, they copied the framework, and the mood from the first Rambo: the retired hero, who tries to live anonymously, away from the world, someone to whom unhappiness is ever denied and who will eventually get pulled back to the action painful world he is escaping.<br/><br/>But this Rambo has no Vietnam, no drive, no reason to be, no real pain. Even the pain of brutally loosing a loved one is replaced by the mere rage for being betrayed. Just claws and rage. So, nothing to see here. Adamatium claws are still just claws."

","X-men Origins: Wolverine was planed to be the starting ground for the series Origins, which would show the beginnings of the heroes and heroines of this Franchise. Sadly the movie was panned by audiences and critics alike ,besause to give you the short version it was bad and the fact it didn't make enough money to be consider blockbuster and so the plug for the Origins series was drawn out.<br/><br/>So which is the reason for its underwhelming performance? For starters had almost every clich√© of an action film we all more or less know and we have seen in that least a dozen movies! If this was a simple action adventure, then none would wine about that, but when you try to make lead role the most favorite character of the X-men series ,the criteria go, logically, up! There is one ,now another issue was the underdeveloped characters in the movie ,I didn't like them ,hate, get interested for their stories at all and it goes with out saying what happened to Deadpool!<br/><br/>Next to the list is the effects, wow, are hilariously bad!! For real some of them look so bad that I was wondering were did the 150 million dollars of the budget went. Probably to Hugh Jackman, the producers and the merchandise ,haha, I fart on your general direction. Finally it has more plot holes than a Swiss cheese and so many inconsistencies that you thing ,the writers never bother watching the previous installments.<br/><br/>Final thoughts, if you are under twelve then seems horrifying and good ,but after puberty you realize who must it suck."
"nicolechan916","5","0","2","16 February 2016"," Shallow story with average acting and effects.
","I found this story to be pretty shallow as things just seemed to happen without explanation. The beginning scene just jumps right into it with no context given. Things happened very sequentially and it was continuous but so much so that it felt mechanic. The film was also predictable and presented a little statically. I'm not saying the whole film was awful, some scenes were OK, but overall I wasn't feeling it. <br/><br/>The acting is average. I know Wolverine is supposed to be this kind of stoic person- so props to Jackman for keeping his character consistent throughout all these years, but that also makes him hard to relate to. Will.i.am does a decent job as does Collins, Schreiber, Huston and Reynolds (who does a much better Deadpool in the recent one). Personally, I felt that Taylor Kitsch's performance was the most engaging as his character is the most charismatic and with the most flare. <br/><br/>Additionally, I did not feel the chemistry between the actors, and their dialogue felt awkward at times. The elderly Hudson couple (Julia Blake and Max Cullen) added an interesting alternative to the way Wolverine's life could have ended up. I liked the addition of the couple as it added something homely and civilized to the chaos of the film. That is probably why I did not like the film that much, because it had so much unnecessary and unexplained violence and aggression.<br/><br/>The visual effects of the gore, and of certain landscapes as well are quite lacking. Numerous scenes are obviously filmed in front of a green screen which actually made me wonder how old the film was when I was watching it. Blood splatters too is very tomato-sauce like. Action scenes weren't too bad though, and stunts are well performed."

","The film opens with Wolverine(real name James Logan)with his brother and we see that their father gets killed. But he is shocked that the man who killed his so called father wasn't his biological father at all it was the man who killed his so called father was his own real father. We then cut to see James and his brother grow up and battle in wars and everything(both played by Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber and the film progresses along. <br/><br/>Later we see that James and his brother have a heated argument as he James abandon's his brother for Project X. Meanwhile we get to find out that he lives a normal life now and has a girlfriend(played by Lynn Collins from 13 Going On 30)and all is good for him,except for one day James' brother strikes revenge and kills James's girlfriend and he of course gets revenge. <br/><br/>James then meets up with a man who gives him the Project X and it is here where James' ditches his name and calls himself Wolverine(as his girlfriend gave him this nickname)and he goes into this tank of water that gives him his powers of healing and his claws and he later escapes and meets his brother Sabbatooth(played by Liev Schrieber who worked with Hugh Jackman in the 2001 romantic fantasy comedy Kate & Leopold) and Deadpool(played by Ryan Reynolds who shows up in the beginning of the film but he doesn't show up till the very end of the movie). But when Logan meets a famous face from his past once he find out what the man that gave him the project X is at he gets the shock of his life. Could it be Logan's girlfriend who got killed by Sabbatooth?.<br/><br/>Also starring US singer Will.I.AM,this film reminds me of Superman's backstory as we see Wolverine escaping the place where he got his powers from and hides out in this farmer house where he meets a farmer and his wife and he stays with them for a while. The part I thought was cool was when Wolverine and Sabbatooth were battling Deadpool and he vanishes here and there.Plus Wolverine's power are cool too. <br/><br/>Hugh Jackman without a doubt is one if not the finest Australian actor in Hollywood. His well known as Wolverine and for starring in a lot of action films and less romantic films(I think he should star in more romantic films down the line,but I suppose his too old for romantic comedies I dunno). As for the rest they were all decent but you can't beat Jackman who steals the whole film. The effects were good too,like one where his on a motorbike and this big explosion comes out of nowhere,it was really good.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed it mostly for the effects and Hugh Jackman. But the problem is that it doesn't give you a great depth to Wolverine as a charcther. I kept questioning to myself the whole time how did he get the bone claws that turned to metal claws?,why did his biological dad killed his adopted dad. There was a lot of plot holes that needed to be resolved. But having said that I liked it mostly for Jackman and the effects."

Once I heard that Deadpool, Wolverine, and Gambit were all going to be in one film, I was sold. I decided that this was a must-watch.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>There was too many characters, so each of the characters were not developed well. Many of the mutants we know of, including Wolverine and his brother, are cast in the government's squad, Team X. Since there were too many characters, the film failed in the character development. Characters such as Gambit and Blob barely add to the film, and were just there for the sake of adding more characters to the film.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was not that good either. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool was OK, and I have to say that Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was a good choice. Besides that, acting was spotty and at some areas, awkward. Something felt missing, and it felt like the actors weren't that interested in their roles in this film.<br/><br/>The only good part of this film was the action. There were many fight scenes that were epic, but at the same time, awkward.

","I have never quite figured out who Stan Lee writes his material for. His ideas are, to say the least, extremely weird. His ""creatures"" are referred to as ""mutants"" but that's taking the term to ridiculous extremes. I mean, some children's' movies are bad enough. Little, impressionable kids grow up believing in anthropomorphised bears, chickens, dogs, cats and just about every other animal but this is obviously not aimed at children (I HOPE!). So who is it aimed at? <br/><br/>Sheldon Cooper and his genius pals are huge Stan Lee fans which I have always found incongruous given that they are scientists (although, Sheldon often points out that his mother did have him tested for being crazy).<br/><br/>Seriously though, where does this movie fit into the general scheme of things? Obviously it is fantasy, but I would question whether it is science fiction. If all the main characters were extraterrestrials then I could give them some credence but, for them to be human beings with weird attributes just doesn't gel with me. Human mutants are actually very sad people who have been cursed with things like blindness, paralysis and numerous other debilitating disabilities - the only ones who might be deemed fortunate being those with exceptionally high IQs or with eidetic memories (and it's questionable whether those are mutants anyway).<br/><br/>To be confronted by indestructible weirdos is in the same vein as vampire and werewolf movies which are classified as horror, not sci- fi.<br/><br/>Sorry, this is not my idea of a great way to spend over an hour-and- a-half."

","Hugh Jackman is once again excellent as Wolverine but the whole thing is uninspired. The rest of the cast are (more or less) all either dull or just plain bad. The relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth (who was nowhere near as intimidating as in the first film, which probably means that he works best as a lackey) had the potential to be interesting but it wasn't. Gambit, one of my favourite characters from the 1990s animated series, is wasted in a fairly small role and is played by a bad actor in Taylor Kitsch. I wish that they had kept Brian Cox as Stryker rather than casting Danny Huston. Honestly, Patrick Stewart's 20 second cameo was my favourite part of the film. I suppose that it was competently enough directed but that's hardly anything to write home about. Even Hugh Jackman said that he didn't really like the film.<br/><br/>""X-Men: The Last Stand"" had a host of problems but a bad cast certainly wasn't one of them. Even the actors with smaller roles in that film, such as Josef Sommer as the President and Shohreh Aghdashloo as Dr. Rao, were very good. In this film, not so much.

","It was only a matter of time before most people's favourite X-Man, Logan a.k.a. Wolverine, got his own stand-alone movie. After Brett Ratner's atrocious X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) almost killed the franchise in it's tracks, 2009 was the perfect time for not so much a re-boot, but a fresh take, employing the Oscar-winning director of 2005's wonderful Tsotsi, Gavin Hood, to tackle the indestructible mutant's origin story. The result is an ugly mess of meaningless CGI, repetitive fights, corny dialogue and an over-abundance of dull supporting mutants.<br/><br/>After taking an extended holiday following the events of William Stryker's (Danny Huston) violent Team X mission in Africa, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is happily living as a shirtless lumberjack in Canada with his beautiful girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). His estranged brother, Victor a.k.a. Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber), seems to be picking off members of Team X, so Wolverine is approached by Stryker to help with the problem. At first he declines, but when he finds Kayla's bloodied body in the forest bearing the marks of Victor, he joins Stryker who implants the alien metal adamantium into his body.<br/><br/>Origin stories are always difficult, and only Iron Man (2008) seems to have dodged the problem of making the creation of the superhero more interesting than what they can do with their newly-found powers. Origins takes the approach of practically ignoring it completely. We have a brief scene at the start with Logan and Victor as kids, and then a montage of the brothers fighting in the American Civil War, World War II and Vietnam. Within minutes, we have skipped well over 100 years of Wolverine's life (it appears he was born around 1840). It's main focus is the rivalry between Logan and Victor, and Schreiber snarls his way through some dodgy lines and somehow manages to come through unscathed.<br/><br/>Truth is, Origins has more in common with the previous X-Men films than any other superhero kick-start film, filling scenes with forgettable mutants such as Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), Fred Dukes a.k.a. The Blob (Kevin Durand), John Wraith (Will.i.am) and Chris Bradley a.k.a. Bolt (Dominic Monaghan). I would have happily paid extra to see more of Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), who was no doubt added to appease fans but is criminally ignored once he shows his face, and Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), whose story arc left me dumbfounded at the missed opportunity. Because of this, Wolverine is almost left out to dry. Normally, Jackman's charisma shines through, but here he just scowls.<br/><br/>All in all, this is no better or worse than those recent comic-book hero disasters Ghost Rider (2007) and Jonah Hex (2010). The first two X-Men films, directed by Bryan Singer, were really quite good, but the franchise (at this point) had become nothing more than a wad of money thrown at the screen in the hope that the crash-bang-wallop action scenes would keep the audience distracted enough to not realise what they are watching is a large pile of crap. Schreiber at least keeps things lively, and Hood is wise enough to keep things well below the two hour mark. But that is scant praise indeed, and the best thing about the film is that the sight of Wolverine chopping wood brings to mind Monty Python's Lumberjack Song.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

On one hand, X-Men: The Last Stand was a disaster, but why not continue this commercially successful franchise in form of a prequel of its most marketable (and possibly the most interesting) character ‚Äì Wolverine? However, just like X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a simply bad movie. And yet two years later, the X-Men franchise managed to redeem itself with X-Men: First Class.<br/><br/>The movie follows Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) during his pre-X-men days. He and his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber), both immortal mutants with amazing healing powers, spent most of their lives fighting in major wars (the civil war, WWI, WWII, Vietnam) before settling in a secret military group, led by William Stryker (Danny Huston), which goal was to supposedly fight for American interests. During one routine mission in Africa, Logan is disgusted by the groups' methods of persuasion and decides to leave them. But, several years later, his past comes back to haunt him.<br/><br/>There are several things very wrong with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. First of them being the serious lack of any kind of coherent, noteworthy plot. The movie is packed with (PG-13) action sequences every five minutes or so, which does get pretty boring very fast; and there is no real dramatic conflict to back those action sequences up. Not only is the plot not satisfactory, but the portrayal of the mutant Deadpool, isn't either. Deadpool, a fan favorite, made his big screen debut in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but in his case the source material is completely disregarded ‚Äì he is nothing like his comic book counterpart ‚Äì and as a result, his character is inane.<br/><br/>It's a shame Deadpool was portrayed the way he was since he was played by Ryan Reynolds, an actor many people agree is the perfect choice for playing Deadpool. However, not every casting choice in the movie was as good as this one. For some reason, the singer of Black Eyed Peas, will.i.am, was in the movie and was awful at playing the mutant John Wraith; and the brilliant Brian Cox, in spite of being interested in doing so, isn't in the movie reprising his role of William Stryker. Instead, he is replaced by the charmless Danny Huston. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber are good as mutant brothers (especially Jackman who, after all, is a veteran in his role), but that isn't enough to keep this movie from falling apart.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"moviemattb","4","0","1","17 May 2014"," Terrible spin-off from the X-Men series, but its watchable
","Five years ago, I used to love this movie and thought it can be better than other super hero spin-offs. Now, by looking back at this movie, it does not hold up really well. I can now see what went wrong with this movie, but I don't hated it. There are some things that I do like about ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" while the rest I have issues with. Hugh Jackman does a fantastic job as the Wolverine, and he does make this movie worth watching because he is the Wolverine. Some of the cast like Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston, Lynn Collins, Taylor Kitsch, and such did fine for what they have to do. I thought the music by Harry Gregson Williams isn't that bad, but not one of the greatest that I've ever heard. Some of the action is bit standard, but that does not mean they are bad. With that said, the origin story for our main character isn't well told which they tried to make it a decent character study, but it was poorly executed. Nevertheless, I at least give it some credit for trying. The special effects in this movie are downright terrible. Wolverine's claws in the other X-Men movies were practical, but now they are CG. Thankfully, they went back to practical on the other Wolverine movie which that one is better than this movie. The script is poorly written, and could have use some rewrites before making this movie. The time frame is mess up in this movie because the movie is suppose to be taken place in the late 1970s and early 80s, but the movie acts like if this was today. There are plot holes in this movie, and they don't make any sense. First, those computers in the movie don't exist like this until the today's technology; second, they put Gambit in this movie, but what will happen to him when he joins part of the X-Men? He will become in older man, and third, did most of the people who were behind this movie ever read the comics? I don't think so. Once again, I can now see what's wrong with this movie and wish that the script deserves some rewrites, and make it a better movie. If you want see a better Wolverine movie, then watch ""The Wolverine."" James Mangold made that the better Wolverine than what Gavin Hood did with this movie. This is a terrible spin-off from the X-Men series, but its watchable. I give ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" a 4 out of 10. Oh, and one more thing, I do hope that ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" fixes up the time frame, and I will be looking forward to it when it comes to theaters on May 23rd."

","I know that based on the reviews and ratings for Last Stand, this should have been INFINETLY worse, but honestly, I didn't flat out hate it. OK, I think it has some problems, but I didn't think it Completely bombed.<br/><br/>The acting was OK, the cinematography was serviceable and the plot was decent over all. But then, in comes what DIDN'T work. First off, the dialogue got hammy and contrived at times. When Kayla said ""I love you"" when Logan found her mortally wounded, I felt like that was too clich√© and over the top for some reason. Then the effects looked a bit choppy in some shots, like Logan first unsheathing his claws. To me, they looked a little too CG-ish. And the background during the reactor fight kind of made it a little obvious it was green-screened. And lastly, Deadpool was NOT given the proper respect he deserved. If and when they decide to do a Deadpool solo movie, they need to go ALL OUT and just make him as crazy as all hell. Ryan Reynolds' performance was on the right track, but if they want this to work, they need to push it even further.<br/><br/>I don't know why I hated this film LESS than Last Stand, but maybe I'm just a sucker for prequels. Now it's time for First Class. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique? Yeah, I think I'm in for a fun time. ^_^"

"MaximumMadness","5","0","1","30 November 2013"," While undeniably better than the prior film, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is still a fundamentally flawed, under-written piece of work.
","Every so often, you will encounter a film that truly throws you for a loop. One of those films where it seems that everything should be working for the best and coming together to make for a good film-going experience... yet it just doesn't. It instead just sort of clunks to a stop and falls apart in front of you.<br/><br/>""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is one such film.<br/><br/>This movie should work. We have Hugh Jackman returning in the lead role of Logan/Wolverine. Liev Schreiber joining the cast as Logan's brother Victor. A storyline covering the origins of Wolverine as hinted at in the excellent ""X2: X-Men United."" Academy Award winning director Gavin Hood taking the helm. And of course the miserable experience of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", which the studio has hopefully learned from. This should have been a guaranteed, surefire good film.<br/><br/>But it's not quite.<br/><br/>Jackman stars as Logan. After fleeing from a troubling past including several wars alongside his brother Victor (Schreiber) and a brief yet turbulent stint as a mercenary in ""Team X"", Logan has retired to Canada, working as a Lumberjack (of course), and living an idealistic romantic life with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. (Lynn Collins) However, Victor suddenly returns, apparently on a mission to kill off all the former members of Team X. Soon enough, Logan discovers that Victor has killed Kayla as a way to bring him out of hiding. Seeking vengeance, Logan teams with his former Commander William Stryker (Danny Huston), agreeing to undergo a unique procedure to coat his skeletal system with an indestructible metal and turn him into the most ferocious weapon imaginable... Weapon X.<br/><br/>The cast is very much a mixed bag. Jackman and Schreiber come off the best as Logan and Victor, both giving good, powerful performances that mix the action, emotion and development quite well. Though her role is limited, Collins is very decent as Silverfox, although she and Jackman don't really have a strong chemistry, which makes the romance feel forced and makes her come off far worse than she is. I found Huston to be just awful as Stryker, though. He takes over from Brian Cox, and gives a weak, sort-of forced performance that just rubbed me the wrong way. Although supporting roles by the likes of Taylor Kitsch, will.i.am and Ryan Reynolds are (for the most part) decently played.<br/><br/>The production is pretty flawed. The script (by the talented David Benioff and the hack-tastic Skip Woods, who would later go on to ruin ""Die Hard"" with the dreadful fifth film) is bizarrely good and bad, depending on the scene. There's a lot to like there, including a fantastic opening montage taking place in battles throughout history, a fun scene in which Logan is forced to stay with an elderly couple, and some great action beats. But then again, there's a lot to hate, including some really forced and contrived dialog, a lot of really horrible changes to the characters and continuity (particularly the side-character of Deadpool, who ends up being completely destroyed by the script), and a lot of severe pacing issues. It's mixed beyond belief .<br/><br/>The direction is also very mixed. Some of Hood's visual stylings and choices in shots are fantastic, but when it comes to the action, you can tell Hood is getting lost. The action is just too dull, and often feels like it's patched together haphazardly. This is particularly noticeable in one scene where Logan slices through scaffolding and metal ladders in an alleyway to get to a character called Gambit. It's one of the most bizarre, un-exciting, patched together action sequences I've ever seen, and has some cringe-worthy shots and effects. (I've heard rumors that Richard Donner was even brought in to shoot new shots for the action scenes, which wouldn't surprise me.) Hood does a lot better during the quiet moments, although I will admit the opening credits sequence and the big final fight are well-shot.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the productions are equally so-so. The CG effects are decent for the most part, but there was an inexplicable choice to make Wolverine's trademark claws CG, and it looks dreadful. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is very decent, but it just doesn't measure up to the other films. The set and costume design is nice, but doesn't have much character.<br/><br/>This is just a mixed, mixed film with a plethora of flaws despite some strengths in the acting and some standout scenes. It's quite tragic, because there's a lot to like behind-the-scenes, from a talented director to a very decent cast. But for one reason or another, it just didn't quite gel together. <br/><br/>But hey, at least it's better than the awful ""X-Men: The Last Stand.""<br/><br/>I give ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" an average 5 out of 10. It's just for die-hard fans of the series, honestly. All others need not apply."

","And get over the fact that it could've been more realistic & experimental. Walking on the same lines of how superhero movies trod, the origin of the Wolverine is clear and that is what we should try to relish.<br/><br/>First things first... Hugh Jackman is amazing as always. Liev Shcrieber amazed me, while Will.i.am acts foolish and tries hard to look strict. Supporting cast is fine. But these factors only do a quarter for the viewers to enjoy. With a shoddy plot work, the story follows the lead hero & strives hard to stay with him. Cameos by other X-men do little to zero to charm.<br/><br/>With a below average CGI & VFX, this film is a fine staple for X-men fans. Otherwise, jump to the 2013 version.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Recommended!"
"allanh91","4","0","1","30 September 2013"," www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS
","It was universally accepted after the X-men trilogy that Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, much like Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man. His performance was a standout of the saga, and it would be foolish for Fox not to exploit that to make serious cash. Whilst Wolverine's origins were flirted with in ""X-men"", and their surfaces scratched in ""X2"", the story was never fully explored. Gavin Hood was the man chosen, even over Bryan Singer and Brett Ratner, to bring Wolverine's tale to the big screen, and finish off what was started in 2000.<br/><br/>After watching Wolverine discover his bony, partially see-through claws as a young boy and running away with his brother Victor, we are treated to an impressive segment with some artistic VFX and camera work showing Logan and Victor fighting through the wars of time. The two are then placed in front of a firing squad for dissent, which they survive, only to be enlisted in the special program of a certain William Stryker, along with other powerful mutants including Wade Williams (Ryan Reynolds). Their actions are eventually too distressing for Logan, who retires to pursue a quiet life with a beautiful woman, working as a lumber jack. However, Logan's peace and solitude is shattered when his past life catches up to him, and he must seek revenge against his brother for destroying his world.<br/><br/>Before you watch ""Origins"", you have to disregard the political and social undertones from the X-men series. This is not a film about mutants, humans and morals. This is a revenge action thriller based around one mutant's rage against those who seek to destroy his livelihood. Jackman lives up to the premise of the film. His aggression has evolved into something quite terrifying, if a little melodramatic at times (not helped by some very poor directing) and his physical performance and appearance is quite incredible. Performing most of his own stunts and extensively working out/ gaining weight further solidifies the dedication Jackman has for the role. Liev Schreiber (Sabretooth) fits nicely opposite Jackson for scenes of conflict, but I never felt the relationship they had as brothers was believable. Their co-operative fight against weapon XI at the conclusion was well scripted and choreographed, but the dialogue in the rest of the film never expressed the hurt a person would feel when his ideals clash against their brother strongly. In other words, the conflict was ignored on an emotional level.<br/><br/>The rest of the film follows a similar tone as the brothers' relationship, if you treat it exactly as it is, you'll enjoy the action and some of the special effects, but you'll miss out on any substance. I say some special effects because some are also quite horrendous: Wade Williams sword scene in Lagos, Wolverine walking away from the exploding helicopter (ruined what was a brilliant action scene) and several shots of Wolverine's claws were all pretty poor. There is also no chemistry between any of the cast worth shouting about. The story which gives Logan the idea for his alias is actually quite comically scripted (it's meant to be romantic) and acted, while the rest of the cast give Schreiber and Jackman nothing to play off of in terms of acting quality. Really, the other mutants in Stryker's team are written in purely for name dropping and thickening a very thin plot after their original involvement. Gambit's portrayal was embarrassing; after the cries of many fans to have him introduced, the result was short lived and fairly pointless (he was essentially just a personal skivvy for Wolverine who knew some card tricks and was a nuisance in a fight between Wolverine and Sabretooth). However, contrary to most, I actually enjoyed Reynolds portrayal as Wade Williams; he was annoying and not overtly comical, yet had a playful innocence which gave character to Stryker's otherwise scowling, ""high- protein diet"" team.<br/><br/>Storywise, Origins was thin, and could really have been wrapped up in about an hour if it wasn't for the seemingly last minute throw in of as many names as possible (the film was about Wolverine's origins, I'd personally have liked to have seen Cyclops and Emma Frost get separate films, thank you very much). The twist wasn't predictable and gave the end of the film a much needed shot in the arm, but was farcically conceived. Logan's lover ""dies"" brutally and bloodily at the hands of a savage mutant with claws for fingernails, yet doesn't have a single injury? Surely something else could have been arranged as this was just borderline silly, as any sane person would have made such a connection and smelled foul play on the lover's part. There have been complaints about how Logan loses his memory via Stryker's adamantium bullet, however I think it was a reasonable explanation that the bullet would have caused non-fatal trauma severe enough to cause Logan's memory to be affected. Although, such a bullet would have appeared in the x-ray process in ""X-men (2000)"", so there's maybe a continuity case if we're being picky.<br/><br/>In the music department, ""Origins"" is a marked improvement from the original trilogy. Stand out scenes include the Lagos theme for Stryker's crew and the close of the film after Wolverine regains consciousness.<br/><br/>In all, if you like explosions, rippling muscles, well choreographed action scenes and borderline cheesy romance, all with a dash of the supernatural, but you're not a big fan of substance, writing or depth, then ""Origins"" will be a welcome addition to your DVD collection. If you were a fan of the subplot of the previous X-Men films, detailing the social struggles for mutants to be accepted, and the struggles of humans to accept them, then you'll watch the film but probably won't enjoy it on a level beyond admiring Hugh Jackman's performance as the Wolverine."

","X-men Origins Wolverine is a miserable failure. This is a fact that is really well known, like they had all the ingredients to make a fun summer blockbuster but they fumbled the ball. The gruff, adamantium-clawed Marvel superhero Wolverine strikes out on his own in this X-Men spin-off starring series regular Hugh Jackman. The story gets under way as the boy who will become Wolverine makes a shocking discovery about his family bloodline, and gains a brother in the process. Flash forward to find the mutant siblings battling side by side through two world wars and Vietnam -- where they are sentenced to death for killing a commanding officer -- and Logan (Hugh Jackman) and his brother, Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth, played by Liev Schreiber), have joined a top-secret government task force. When their targets begin to include innocent civilians, conscientious Logan escapes to the Canadian Rockies, where he builds a home with pretty schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Informed by his old commanding officer William Stryker (Danny Huston) that the members of his old team are being targeted for death, Logan is heartbroken when Victor finds and kills Kayla. Vowing revenge, Logan agrees to take part in a dangerous experiment that will fuse his bones with a powerful metal alloy called adamantium, which makes him virtually indestructible and gives him the strength needed to defeat his powerful brother. Subsequently betrayed by Stryker, Logan (now Wolverine) sets out to find his blood-lusting brother and stop the cycle of violence once and for all. Along the way, the temperamental hero is joined by fellow mutants John Wraith (Will.i.Am) and Remy LeBeau (aka Gambit, played by Taylor Kitsch). But before Wolverine can seek vengeance against Striker and his brother, he'll have to do battle with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) a formidable mutant instilled with many powers. (Jason Buchanan, Rovi) Funny thing is though, the movie does a horrible job explaining all this? The scriptwriter is Skip Woods, who is known for such classics as Swordfish and A Good Day to Die Hard. This is such a terrible script, it is mind boggling really. The dialogue is so flat, dull, and unfunny and the plot makes no sense. So you are gonna kill Wolverine, a man made of adamantium, with an adamantium bullet. Forget basic science, that idea in of itself is stupid. The special effects are all beyond awful. Which is unforgivable considering how big this film's budget was. And don't get me started with Deadpool. I can forgive if they change stuff from the comics, but in the context of the film itself it is still a stupid idea. You don't get a funny guy like Ryan Reynolds, make him a bad ass in the beginning, and then glue his goddamn mouth shut!!!! I will say this about the film though: The films action scenes aren't bad. They aren't good either though. Hugh Jackman gives a powerful performance in the role, Liev Schreiber does good, and Danny Houston does good as Stryker. The biggest problem lies in the premise itself: We do not need to know the history of this character. What makes Wolverine so awesome is his sense of mystery!!!! Like seriously. And I know they made a comic that told us his origins as well, and to be honest it was bad there as well. X-Men Origins may not be the worst superhero movie ever made, not even close actually. But it is among the most forgettable and mediocre superhero movies ever made."

Of course this is a film about Wolverine and all that... but some of the supporting actors just come and go, like nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman does, as usual, well as the emotionally damaged Logan and you really believe that the character has gone through much pain. The supporting actors also do well: Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed is not as good and by that I mean he went sometimes a little over the top. <br/><br/>I do understand that many don't like this film, I really do.

","A couple decades out of date, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is a dull superhero flick by director Gain Hood. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, an adamantium clawed mutant with remarkable healing abilities.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is well cast, looks exactly like the Wolverine of Marvel Comics lore (a cross between Clint Eastwood and a werewolf), but the film he's stuck in is wholly generic. The film's action sequences are equally silly, and feel like they belong in a 1990s Steven Seagal flick, slow-motion fireballs and all.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Jackman's Wolverine was handled much better by director Bryan Singer in previous ""X-Men"" flicks. Singer understood how to use Wolverine: sparingly, his violence hinted at and not pushed past gratuitous lengths. Gavin Hood does the opposite, mistaking excess for excitement. <br/><br/>4/10 ‚Äì Worth no viewings."

","moviestoenjoy.wordpress.com<br/><br/>Unlike previous X-Men films, this movie tells the story of a single mutant, James Logan a.k.a Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) starting with his childhood until the day he lost his memory (directly related to X-Men 2). Many mutants appear in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but I have to say that the most remarkable was Remy LeBeau (Taylor Kitsch), a.k.a Gambit. But I really liked Ryan Reynolds part too.<br/><br/>Even though the fighting scenes are good, I have to say that a little more blood would have given the movie more value. Another con about X- Men Origins, is the lack of consistence between this movie's storyline and the storyline of the previous movies. Details like these can really make a difference in a movie like this one.<br/><br/>So we can say that X-Men Origins isn't a bad movie, but it's not a brilliant one either.

","""X-Men"" was one of the few superhero comic-book-adaptations that actually worked. It wasn't so much the special effects, it was the ""human-factor"", depicting the mutants as people with special powers, who invariably had to pay the price for those powers (Rogue, unable to touch another being without (almost) killing them; Cyclops inability to look at anybody without his glasses and Wolverines pain, whenever his claws would surface, etc). Perhaps the older generation remembers a David Cronenberg movie called ""Scanners"". Same story: ordinary people with extraordinary powers and the terrible price they had to pay for those (unasked-for) powers ‚Äì ""Scanners"" was all about the people; the sequels were all about their powers.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman goes through the motions in the role, for which he'll most be remembered but, by now, the ""Wolverine"" character has become an action-figure of itself: again, the human factor missing. We could relate to him in ""X-Men"", where the pain of memory loss and retractable claws were ever-present; in ""Wolverine"" he's almost a caricature of his own character.<br/><br/>Highlights are Liev Schreiber as antagonistic 'Sabretooth' (diabolical yet strangely amiable at the same time), the 'Blob' as comic-relief character (in the comics he strikes as more tragic) and Dominic Monaghan in a short, but poignant guest-role. Ryan Reynolds is playing the same role he's been playing since the beginning of his career: ""Ryan Reynolds playing Ryan Reynolds as ¬Ö (add your pick here)"", in the case of ""Wolverine"", 'Deadpool'. He does it well, being a mix of his likable self and the cynical 4th wall breaking Mutant of the comic ‚Äì in the first part, that is; during the last part he plays like some run-off-the-mill killer-machine, raising the question whether the producers have actually read any ""Deadpool""-Comics. Apart from Sabretooth, most of those characters appear predominantly during the first quarter of the movie, which is the strongest part. The rest concentrates on Wolverines origin story, which, it begs the question, is actually quiet unnecessary, even unwanted, considering that the ""enigma of Wolverine"" in the original Film is what makes him such an interesting character. It's like filming a prequel to ""The Dark Knight"", where it is revealed that the Joker used to be a janitor, driven insane by the rejection of a former girlfriend.<br/><br/>As is often the case, ""more"" isn't necessarily ""better"".

","'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' was highly anticipated, Wolverine was thought to be everyone's favourite in the X-Men series but this film disappointed a lot of people.<br/><br/>Acting in this film varies from good (Hugh Jackman) to very bad. A surprising amount of this cast don't perform very well. Will.I.Am's character being one of the worst. Lynn Collins does not perform that well either, it can be quite embarrassing at times.<br/><br/>The plot again varies, at some points it can be very well written such as the scene where Wolverine meets the elderly couple. But then in other scenes it can be cringe-worthy, like when Wolverine has a boxing match with a ludicrously over-weight person for no apparent reason. <br/><br/>The dialogue is awful, it is so cheesy at some points you feel like turning the film off. The dialogue gets even more embarrassing as the film reaches the climax, where everyone decides to be friends momentarily. Another bad aspect of this film is where the director has decided to make Jackman look up and scream at the sky whilst the camera pans out, this happens at least three times in the film all with dramatic music playing behind it. You think they're doing this as a joke, but there is no tongue-in-cheek here whatsoever and they are being completely serious when they do this.<br/><br/>Overall, if you really want to see this film then go ahead but be warned, you will almost certainly be disappointed if you are a huge fan of the X-Men series. It starts out really good and slowly gets worse and worse."
"Leofwine_draca","5","0","2","1 November 2011"," Pretty good for an origin story
","I'm no big fan of origin stories. I just want movies to get on with telling stories about established characters, instead of going through the motions with stuff we already know will happen. As it goes, though, X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE isn't too bad at all. It's a lightweight piece of fluff that descends into THE PHANTOM MENACE style inanity for the effects-heavy climax, but until that point it's a watchable film, trading on Jackman's easy charm and his engaging character.<br/><br/>There's plenty going on in the film as the story progresses, and some of it is interesting, the rest less so. Wolverine's attempts at a romantic relationship are a definite draw, but the scenes of his rebirth in Stryker's lab feel repetitive after we already saw much of it in flashbacks in the original X-MEN trilogy. There seem to be too many extra superheroes (Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch) added into the mix who don't really go anywhere and feel like an unnecessary presence. Occasionally the film veers into complete nonsense, like the boxing match with Kevin Durand in a fatsuit: something out of an excruciating Eddie Murphy comedy, not a superhero film.<br/><br/>Still, Jackman is good here; he seems relaxed, happier with the role than in the past. He's no great actor, but he has the kind of likability that made Van Damme a star back in his day. Liev Schreiber also contributes a strong turn as the feral Sabretooth, a villain with more depth than you might imagine, although Danny Huston is nothing more than a stock bad guy. Others, like Dominic Monaghan, are completely wasted. The film is well paced and the effects are occasionally impressive, but a lot of the CGI work is unforgivably shoddy (the bit with Schreiber jumping along a corridor is worse than similar scenes in BLADE 2, a decade previously). Nevertheless this stuff doesn't matter so much when you've got a film as easygoing and likable as this."

Oh, to bring up many mentions of the blades looking different from the other movies, these would be the most accurate portrayal. His bone blades weren't replaced.

"ARTaylor","6","0","2","8 June 2011"," Not X-Men's Proudest Moment, Not Their Worst
","After the massively disappointing (though box office success) X-Men: The Last Stand, Fox needed something to improve their franchise name. So they turned to the fan favorite hero who also happened to have just been featured in the massive Marvel crossover House of M and even had his own series, Wolverine. Logan was the center of the last three movies so they logically assumed a movie of his own would be just as successful. They thought wrong.<br/><br/>X-Men and X2 were successful because they were intelligent and well made stories. Wolverine did have a major part in the stories, but he wasn't the only one. The Last Stand was over packed with characters and story so that no one, not even Wolverine, had a decent character arc. And honestly, he was only featured because most of the other main cast were killed off or unceremoniously pushed to the side. Now in the comics, Logan has had a lot of success in individual series. But the movie contained none of what made those comics good.<br/><br/>The story is an abbreviated version of Logan's early life through Weapon X. Problem is, each and every phase of his life is so incredibly interesting that each could warrant a film of their own. Origins is, in my opinion, one of the best stories Marvel's ever put out and on equal level of DC's Batman: Year One. Here, it's paraphrased in the first five minutes, and all the mystery and intrigue of the comic series is bluntly stated. His time on Team X is also very interesting. Here, it's over in the first thirty minutes and only one mission is shown. Weapon X by Barry Windsor-Smith is, again, one of the best stories you'll read. Here, over with in the first half without anything that made that story engaging. The whole movie is like the CliffNotes version of the comics. You get the basics but none of the heart and soul of it.<br/><br/>The explanation for how Logan loses his memory is atrociously bad. I won't spoil it, but it boggles the mind that the producers came up with something so dumb. It's factually inaccurate, especially within the universe the movies have set up, and just a hair beneath deus ex machina. Origins had a very appropriate explanation that revealed a lot about who he is. If the producers went with that this movie would have been much more Christopher Nolan-esque.<br/><br/>Wolverine also has one major problem that The Last Stand did, far too many characters. And again, the more characters they add the less time to develop any so that basically all become stagnant. Logan has a story but doesn't really evolve. Nor can he since the previous movies established that he will be reset at some point. Stryker in X2 was one of the best villain in film and expertly shows the true enemy of the X- Men. Here, he's simply a maniacal bad guy and almost a mad scientist stereotype. The others (Blob, Maverick, Agent Zero, Gambit, even Silverfox) are simply there to move the plot forward. Fan favorite Deadpool is most disappointing. Like everything else, he's so briefly shown that can't have the time to be the anti-hero fans know and love. Ryan Reynolds was perfect casting. But he only gets two scenes and nothing much to do besides be a guy with swords.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I will say that they did a terrific job with Sabretooth. In X-Men he was simply a big thug who for whatever reason disliked Logan. This version was far more faithful to the comics as he and Logan were personally connected and actually got to play off each other. Liev Schreiber was terrific casting. If there's one good thing to take away from this movie, it's Sabretooth.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman gives another great performance. I still can't imagine any other actor in that part. If only he had a better story to work with. But besides the aforementioned Reynolds and Schreiber, no one else stands out. No one is particularly bad, but no one is more than just okay.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie really should have been R. I understand all the stuff about studio marketing, the teen audience, etc. But Wolverine is Marvel's bloodiest superhero followed far behind by Blade and Punisher (both of which had R rated movies). This shouldn't be a Saturday morning cartoon show where Wolverine can only punch foes and uses his claws to open doors. This is supposed to be long before the X-Men where he still lets his anger get the best of him. Plenty of movies, much like Blade, have proved that R rated can be financially and critically successful.<br/><br/>That being said, this film isn't the worst I've seen. Certainly Daredevil, Ghost Rider, The Last Stand for example are far less entertaining. The action is exciting. Seeing people use powers against each other is always cool. And it does open the gates for Wolverine's early history to those who don't know the comics.<br/><br/>The film is tolerable. Nothing as good as X-Men, X2, or First Class but certainly a step up from The Last Stand. It could have, and should have, been better. I certainly hope the upcoming sequel (as I write this) is better. But being someone who grew up on the 90s X-Men series and the comics, I do say I enjoy watching this simply because I do like Wolverine."

Honestly, for the first half hour I found myself either twiddling my thumbs or scratching my head in confusion.<br/><br/>After that half hour, though, I started to understand what was happening and I was starting to enjoy myself. And then there was a bizarre fight scene and I lost all interest again. Twenty minutes later I got interested again- but this is NOT a consistent film. I was horrified to find out I still had forty minutes to watch, but I stuck it out. And I thought it was worth it to sit through the mindless arguments and random fights, because I was starting to get into it. Yes, there are some great moments in this film, but they're smothered by bizarre conversations, too many innocent people getting killed and WAY too many flashbacks.

","I always admired Hugh Jackman, but X-Men Origins: Wolverine was doomed from the get-go. I think centering a whole movie on what I consider to be an overrated character was a poor choice for the first X-Men Origins story.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw with this film was the idea behind it. I can imagine the appeal behind this character; he is dark, mysterious, and fairly bad-a**. Still, I couldn't imagine him being someone to do a whole character study on, and after seeing this film, I can see that I was right. I feel no emotional or intellectual connection with this character. He's not all that interesting, and I can't even feel humanly concern for him since he, apparently, cannot die. Usually the godlike character is the villain in the movie, but in this film, we're‚Äîsomehow‚Äîsupposed to care about and support him.<br/><br/>The action sequences weren't all that much to look at either. For starters, the special effects look like they were taken out of a Twilight movie. They were awfully computer generated and that really cut down on the entertainment factor for me.<br/><br/>We are also subjected to just about every clich√© in the book. The biggest one was when an explosion happens and Wolverine walks away as though he didn't notice. Yeah, we know you're bad ass, but now we also know you're a pretentious prick.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is a character study on an incredibly uninteresting character, one we can neither identify with nor care for.<br/><br/>And the god-awful effects really didn't help at all.<br/><br/>3/10"

","You can tell that Hugh Jackman put his heart and soul into this film, but at the end of the day, it was never going to be the new Citizen Kane, nor was it going to be the Citizen Kane of superhero movies.<br/><br/>The film overall is chock full of action, and relatively good dialogue, but I couldn't help thinking that it was all a little bit flat. There was one moment that upset me slightly, when a couple who helped Logan were mercilessly killed in order to demonstrate the ""evil"" of the bad guys. I felt that this moment spoilt the rest of the film for me, because it was as though the writer was scraping the barrel for reasons to despise the antagonists.<br/><br/>One thing to its credit though, is the final fight, which I truly appreciated. It was exciting, the choreography was impressive and the special effects were pretty damn good too.<br/><br/>So, overall, it's not going to be remembered in forty years' time, like The Dark Knight certainly will, but it was much better on every front than the disastrous X-Men 3, which took the franchise, and urinated all over it."
"Velociraptor256","5","0","2","18 July 2010"," As strong as adamantium? Not exactly
","This film sets out to explore Wolverine's mysterious past...and doesn't do a terribly good job of it. The story is nothing to get excited about: the first act (Wolverine working with Stryker, and then his time with Kayla Silverfox) has potential, but once he gets his adamantium skeleton, he does little more than meet some other mutants and have the occasional fight before the climax - this doesn't make for a substantial and revealing origin story.<br/><br/>There's very little depth to the film: you'd think that living for over a century and never growing older would have some impact on Wolverine and Sabretooth (whose portrayal is completely inconsistent with how he was in the first X-Men film) and the people they form relationships with, but this is never explored. Nor do we get much detail on the history between these two characters after all we see them go through in the opening credits. And the relationship between mutants and the rest of society - an integral part of the other three films - is barely covered at all here.<br/><br/>Aside from these issues, the dialogue is often silly (""You know what happens to men who go looking for blood? They find it."") and some aspects don't make much sense: for example, Stryker comments that Agent Zero never stood a chance against Wolverine because normal bullets won't hurt him - so why bother sending Agent Zero against him in the first place? The film also features a large number of mutant characters who didn't make it into the other films, and they're fairly interesting to see: unfortunately, we never get to see very much because there's just so many of them crammed in. Easily the most wasted character is Ryan Reynolds as Wade ""Deadpool"" Wilson: in his introductory scenes, he has some of the best lines in the film and looks to be a great character - then he disappears for a long time, and when he comes back, his mouth has been sewn shut. Great.<br/><br/>X-Men Origins: Wolverine is still a fairly entertaining film with decent action scenes, but with very little depth and a great number of flaws, it's pretty much the definition of brainless entertainment."

","You know in 2009 it seemed like we really didn't have a decent string of movies, the first movie that was supposed to kick off the summer blockbusters was ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and it didn't get many good reviews. I love the X-Men series personally, so I suppose I was a bit scared to see this in the theater when it was released because my friend said she was disappointed by it. Figured that it would be a better rental vs. theater. So I watched it the other day on TV and I have to say that actually it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. But I do see where the disappointment was as it seems like Origins relies more on the visuals vs. Logan's story and also the ending is so rushed that you don't seem to care about it's characters. Logan aka ""Wolverine"" is one of the most fascinating characters in X-Men, his past is something that everyone is interested in. But instead while we get a strong performance by Jackman, it seems like it's more about ""revenge, revenge, revenge"" once again, such a clich√©. What could have been a very smart story was a little too rushed in some areas and restricted in others.<br/><br/>In 1845, James Howlett sees his father killed by Thomas Logan. The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from James' hands, and he kills his father's murderer, not realizing that Logan was his father all along. James flees with Victor, the abused son of their father who is now James' brother. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars and the Vietnam War. Major William Stryker approaches them, and offers them membership in Team X. They join the team, but the group's questionable actions and disregard for human life cause James to leave. Six years later, James, lives in Canada with his girlfriend, Kayla. Colonel Stryker locates Logan and warns him that someone is killing members of the team. Shortly afterward, Victor murders Kayla and attacks Logan. Stryker offers Logan a way to beat Victor; Logan undergoes an operation to reinforce his skeleton with a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker orders Logan's memory erased, but Logan overhears and fights his way out. Now filled with revenge, Logan is out to kill both Victor and Stryker for all they've done to him.<br/><br/>Now I thought the action scenes were great, a little over done at times, but it did keep the suspense up. Also like I mentioned before, one of the things that saved this movie for me was the strong performance by Hugh Jackman. He is a commander in an action lead role, it's interesting how versatile he is, he goes from Broadway to Wolverine. Also Liev Schrieber does a good job as Victor, Wolverine's brother, even if he was more growl than dramatic. One of the scenes that ticked me off though is how he ""attacks"" Logan's love, Kayla. She's showed later on that she wasn't killed and only used to trap Logan, but it's so easy to tell that she's part of the plan as we see Victor coming close to her, he's clearly a threat and she looks like ""OK, did you have to ruin my car for the plan?"". She was a lousy performance and in no way strong enough for the role. Danny Huston does a good bad guy, but once again one of my favorite scenes that doesn't make any sense, granted we wouldn't have a movie but, he tells his soldiers how they are going to shoot him to erase his memory. Why not shoot him right as he's screaming hysterically out of the tank? Not a strong story, but good action and a good lead kept me interested, it's a 50/50 for X-Men fans, but most likely are going to have the same opinion as me.<br/><br/>5/10"

Perhaps the folks were more interested in mutants & explosive fun, but the viewer gets quickly bored with all that because of the lack of something to follow.

","After settling down as a lumberjack Logan (Jackman) sets out to avenge a dreadful murder and gets involved in a process that will make him invincible Last summer Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight shook up the foundations of the superhero genre with a darkly portrayal of political action drama and showcased the hero with personal drama and issues, such as his love for Rachel Dawes and has role is Gotham, and Gavin Hood's revitalization of x-men aims to do the same.<br/><br/>As with Batman Begins we open with a young boy learning of his abilities and from there on in there is a natural progression of his supernatural talents. After a fairly flaky title sequence in which the camera shakes and moves too quickly it is nigh on possible to decode the feeling of hardship, the story starts. A disagreement between Logan and his colleagues causes him discomfort and he leaves, only to be found a year later settling down as a lumberjack.<br/><br/>This stage of the film was critical as an emotional death instigates the film's motives, an act for revenge. The driving force is shown through something to non-fans is labelled as weapon x that turns the central protagonist into an invincible machine.<br/><br/>Now I'm all for a bit of action and revenge, there is hardly anything better. Clear favourites in this field are the Bourne films and Quantum of solace. But this critical stage in this film is cheap with minimal dialogue that ends up evaporating into over the top unrealistic action stages. The whole helicopter thing was ridiculous and the last action sequence of the film is so over the top you may just have to hit the stop button.<br/><br/>Depending on your devotion to the x-men series I would personally recommend staying away as this clunky uninteresting exaggerated action flick would undoubtedly harm the foundations of one of the coolest superheroes in comic book history. Hugh Jackman has been rightfully credited as a genius for cementing such a cool persona to the claw driving menace but this particular performance is too simplified, focusing on CGI action and exaggerated revenge concepts. The particular scene when he emerges from the water as part of the experiment is frankly embarrassing.<br/><br/>When reading reviews for this film I found that Ryan Reynolds was praised and being a fan, I looked forward to seeing the actor finally attempt an action persona. And he was quite good, for his 2 minutes of on screen time.<br/><br/>The good points in this film were the inclusion of the prisoners towards the end and though perhaps predictable, a good attempt at a twist.<br/><br/>To sum up this 2009 picture provides its action in buckets but never executes them in the way the script is giving it. Any attempt at action and the director seems to say yes but the fact is this supposed emotional script provides little and with Jackman growling and frowning away we are left with a run of the mill forgettable action romp."

Full of clich√©s it tries to pack as much action into each and every scene as possible, it quickly gets silly. I enjoyed the three original X-men movies very much, but this is not at all up to the standards they set. It is unbalanced, and because of the way it develops, too unbelievable. Sure, I know it is a work of fantasy and fiction, but it is not even believable and true to the universe created by the first three movies, and that is catastrophic.<br/><br/>When the main star stays on to do a sequel it usually means that the production is up to the standard of the previous movies. This obviously is far from it. There are three major faults that almost kills this movie instantly.<br/><br/>The first is the predictability of the story. From the first scene you can almost predict the entire movie. No suspense, no surprise. Just stupid clich√©s one after another. And without the balance of a story with substance, the action just get mind-numbingly boring after a while.<br/><br/>The second weakness is odd and irritating. I haven't read the comics so I don't know the ""true"" history of Wolverine, but I felt that this really broke with the previous but chronologically later movies. I can't see how that Wolverine can come from this version. There is too much that differs, too much that can't plausible develop into what is supposed to happen later on. It's not true to its own ideas and universe. And the stupid Deus Ex Machina that is supposed to save the storyline that give Wolverine an amnesia is just ridiculous. A kindergarten kid could have been more imaginative, and would be just as irritated as me with this story and the previous didn't fit together. This element is just lazy and plain stupid. And what is supposed to happen in the next (planned) prequel, another convenient amnesia? <br/><br/>The third weakness is the most surprising one, but also significant for the entire production. The special effects, and especially the CGI are just plain bad. Many times it just doesn't look real or believable, it looks real amateurish. This is the kind of CGI I would expect in an old episode of Xena, not in a modern high budget movie-sequel. It is so bad that at times the actors really doesn't look to be in the movie at all, you can see them in the studio walking towards the bluescreen behind them. This CGI shortcomings is so bad it should be embarrassing.<br/><br/>In all this prequel was a huge disappointment. It just doesn't look like they made an real effort, only Hugh Jackman as Wolverine works. It seems they thought they could live on the previous movies, and just cash in by cutting too many corners. This is just plain bad craftsmanship.<br/><br/>The best part of a movie should not be myself singing Monty Python's ""He's a lumberjack and he's OK¬Ö"" to some scenes¬Ö 4/10"

","Like George Lucas wasting our time explaining the story of Darth Vader in the three ""Star Wars"" prequels (Episodes I-III)""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" is just another excuse to make money off of a character the public has come to love.<br/><br/>Ever since Bryan Singer abandoned X-Men fans after doing ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" no film has done this great comic book franchise justice. Brett Ratner gave us the fair - at - best ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and now we have been given ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". I'll admit there are a few good scenes in this movie, but when it was finished all I could think about was how unnecessary this film was. We don't need another movie to explain to us why Wolverine is cool. We know why he's awesome.<br/><br/>Another reason I feel this movie is totally unnecessary is because it tells us who Wolverine was. When the whole purpose of X2 is that Wolverine has come to terms with the fact that he will never know who he is, but that it's OK because he has found his purpose with the X-Men. This film takes away the whole mystique (no pun intended) of the character.<br/><br/>So ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" really isn't worth it if you want to remember X-Men the way I do. Awesome.

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a wasted opportunity. What could have been a great character driven superhero movie, concentrating on Wolverine, who he was, and what he was like before his memory loss. Instead, we are treated to a film that has so many secondary characters, that Wolverine almost becomes a supporting act in his own movie.<br/><br/>Several new characters are thrown into the film right, left and centre, most of which are part of Stryker's ""team"" and reminds you a little too much of the mutant team put together in the original X-Men series. Too much focus seems to be put on what-cool-power a character could have, most of which have so few scenes that you are left wondering what was the point in including them at all.<br/><br/>There are several glaring errors in the story, the most obvious being the decision to make Wolverine indestructible, only to turn around and attempt to destroy him shortly afterwards, and of course, the ridiculous reason for Wolverine's memory loss.<br/><br/>There are some good points, however. Hugh Jackman is in his element as Wolverine, several fight sequences stick out, and there is a slight dark edge to the story that was missing from the previous X-Men entry, The Last Stand. However, if they are planning on making a sequel to this movie, please, make it truly about Wolverine, and not about everybody else."

","X-Men Origins: Wolverine: 5 out of 10: Wolverine is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel pantheon. He is also one of the worst. He has the same problem as Superman. He is invulnerable.<br/><br/>Since he cannot be killed, it is somewhat difficult to create any real tension in the action scenes. Origins don‚Äôt even try. Wolverine befriends someone kind and innocent with eyes like a baby fawn. Fawn eyes is brutally murdered. Wolverine goes nuts and destroys a bunch of stuff. Rinse and repeat at least four times. (Think Hulk but skinnier and more Canadian.) The cast is a mixed bag. Jackman is fine (and muscled out) as Wolverine, but since he is constantly revenging loved ones he really does not get the wisecracking material he had in the X-men movies. Liev Schreiber as Wolverine‚Äôs half brother Sabretooth plays the exact same character as he did as Daniel Craig‚Äôs brother in Defiance (minus the pointy teeth however). At least he looks like Jackman‚Äôs brother in this film. (In a strange six degrees twist Jackman and Craig are appearing together on Broadway in A Steady Rain as I write this.) On the negative casting side, we have Taylor Kitsch who has no idea how to play his character Gambit. For one thing, he could not perform a Cajun accent at gunpoint. Moreover, for the coup de gras, we have Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. I know, I know, I also thought there was a judge‚Äôs order preventing Ryan Reynolds from coming within 500 feet of a superhero movie after that Blade Trinity fiasco. After seeing Reynolds butcher Deadpool I can only surmise the terrorists have won.<br/><br/>The cheese is very heavy in this film. One could easily make up bingo cards with movie clich√©s and play along with the film. If one turns there mind off completely (I recommend a malted beverage and perhaps a local herb) there is entertainment value in Wolverine. But good lord where are Mike and the robots when we really need them."
"darthheimdall","6","0","3","6 October 2009"," Strong start, mediocre finish
","This movie had a lot going for it. An interesting take on Wolverine and Sabretooth as brothers and showing their relationship as initially positive as they watch out for each other from childhood in the 1800s to Vietnam. A tragic love story with a folktale that explains why Wolverine chose his name, and his decision to trust the devilish Stryker in order to fulfill his quest of revenge against Sabretooth for killing the woman he loved.<br/><br/>And it is all wrecked by a ridiculous twist in which Kayla Silverfox winds up alive, making Wolverine's vendetta pointless, bringing the plot to a crashing halt, and leaving us wonder why the writers chose to cop out with an unbelievably absurd conspiracy plot when the movie was doing so well. The film would have been much stronger if they had stayed on the dark, dramatic course they started on to explore whether Wolverine's quest for revenge would truly bring peace or destroy him. Not to mention the film was far too short to do justice to all the characters thrown into it, and that the best acted villain in the film, Sabretooth, is later shelved in favor of Deadpool, who would have been better developed in a sequel then randomly thrown in to fight at the last minute of this film.<br/><br/>While it is not as bad as all the haters claim it is, it's not great, either. Rent it on DVD to watch with your friends, but don't expect anything more than mild entertainment."

","Alpha Flight, Bullseye, The Hulk, Mariko Yashida, Stick, Yukio These names are familiar to anyone who grew up reading the X-Men comics. Specifically they all related directly to Wolverine's back story. They are also all completely absent from the movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". Wolverine was always a mystery man. That's what I liked about him. That's what *everybody* liked about him. So, I was more than a little skeptical when I heard they were going to be making a movie about his origin story. Instead of the Canadian mountain man who was experimented on to make a Canadian version of Captain America, who survived the procedure due to a mutant healing power, but wwe are served up a guy named ""James"" who has bone claws and is some kind of Casca-esquire immortal mercenary who's fought in every American war from the Civil War to Vietnam, with his brother (presumably Sabretooth though called ""Victor"" and played by Liev Schreiber rather than Tyler Mane). The Canadian government seems totally out of the picture, and William Stryker (the anti-mutant televangelist from the Graphic novel 'God Loves Man Kills') who is now some sort of U.S. military/government type who is doing mad scientist experiments on mutants for military purposes sort of like the character Henry Peter Gyrich in the X-Men comics (Gyrich you remember was killed in the first X-Men movie by Sabretooth). I can't actually say the film is unenjoyable - it actually is worth it for some fans. Just know that it isn't quite up to the standards of earlier X-Men movies, nor the classic comics. One almost wishes that the creators had spent more time reading Frank Miller's ""Wolverine"" mini-series, and less time watching Hong Kong wire work."

Along with his brother Victor (AKA Sabertooth) they become soldiers, serving in nearly ever war since then. After joining a secret ops squad lead by William Stryker, Logan quits the team to become a lumberjack in Northern Canada (""Ohhh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm o-kay!"")<br/><br/>He meets up with Silverfox, who amazingly is a Native American woman with a blonde sister. She is apparently ""killed"" by Sabertooth, but this is all a ruse to get Logan to agree to have adamantium fused to his bones.<br/><br/>We get to see other X-Men characters in this film- Gambit, Blob, etc.<br/><br/>Okay, I'll grant, the comic book is better.

","Anyone who has seen any of the X-Men Films should enjoy watching this one. However die hard fans of certain characters (such as myself) might be disappointed by the various changes in the character biographies. The movie suffers a bit from the loss of action as most of the movie is about the biography of Wolverine and the mutants he called friends and lovers prior to suffering his memory loss. The only other drawback to the movie being a prequel is knowing which characters will survive. This adds to the loss of suspense during the action. If you are a big fan of the comics or the movies then I am sure you can enjoy this movie as much as I did.

"e-bowen2","6","0","3","17 September 2009"," A review from a Marvel fanboy AND film intellectual.
","For a person that is what my title suggest, I had mixed feeling about the movie. The movie overall was okay as a film AND comic adaptation, but didn't try hard enough to mirror Logan's storyline. It seemed to water down the important elements yet add unnecessary ones to take Logan's origin in a different direction, and I can't think of any logical reason for doing so. It puzzles me that virtually every character from the Weapon X storyline (including John Wraith, who the average comic fan won't be familiar with) is included yet the most important elements of those characters are butchered (especially Zero's), watered down and practically made a mockery of. I won't spoil anything, but what as a comic fanboy I have to say that what the film did towards the end with one of Marvel's most popular characters is unforgivable and is truly the lowest point of the movie for Marvel fans and in my opinion was the one big mistake that the movie might have been more favorably reviewed by fans without.<br/><br/>So what about the movie is good? first and foremost is the acting by the main characters. Jackman shines as Wolverine. His acting is generally impressive and especially so in being true to his character; even better so is Shrieber as Sabretooth. The man perfectly captures the humorously vicious personality of Sabretooth. The bar fight scene between he and Jackman is shining proof of this. Reynolds is perfect as Wade Wilson; it's a shame his screen time is so limited. The special effects are fairly impressive, the action is filled with suspense, and certain parts of Logan's story are captured perfectly; it's a shame it's not like that for every element. Even Danny Huston was particularly interesting as Stryker; accurately depicting the actual character's subtle greed and manipulation.<br/><br/>Not the worst comic-to-movie, but not the brightest. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't take the path to making this movie as story-accurate as it should have been, but any fan of the comics should still see it for the things it does correctly; it's still worth it. Non-comic readers may like it for its action alone, but I strongly encourage anyone seeing the movie to familiarize themselves with the characters' storyline somewhat to fully appreciate the things this film does right. I give it a 6 overall, because it's just good enough to make fans appreciate the few good things and try to remember the film by those things."

Before I went to see it, I was EXTREMELY excited about it, but when I saw it, I was kind of disappointed.<br/><br/>The action sequences didn't last very long, there was a lot of cameos and not enough character development, the plot was okay, it wasn't as dark or powerful as it should've been, and the special effects were kind of cheesy.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman did a good job as Wolverine, Liev Schreiber also did good as Sabretooth because he took his acting seriously, Taylor Kitsch was okay as Gambit, Will.i.am did better than I expected as John Wraith, and Lynn Collins did an okay job as SIlverfox. But I was hoping for Deadpool to have more screen time. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie wasn't bad, but it was very disappointing. Go see the first three X-Men movies, they are much better.

","I can't believe, after hearing Jackman saying so many times that this was his baby and how they wouldn't shoot the script until it was perfect, how bad it is. I find it really hard to believe that a ridiculously high paid, 'professional' writer wrote this. It is badly paced, it is a mish-mash of scenes which feel like they flipped a coin to see where to stick them, and it has far too many characters in it; and the man himself, The Wolverine, is actually a bit of a ponce. I was expecting to see Logan, a man full of uncontrollable rage and hate volunteer himself to the Weapon X programme to make himself even more badass. Instead it's about a simple man with beautiful thick hair, who loves his girlfriend very much, and has claws. And when they pretend to murder her, that makes him want revenge so he goes into the Weapon X programme. Then comes the crappest part of the inept script: I always thought Logan lost his memory during the operation. Well, they had to change that, cus, uhh, like if he loses his memory so early in the film, he won't remember to seek revenge. So lets just write something in at the end where if he gets shot with an adamantium bullet, he'll definitely lose his memory! WHAT? Basically this film concentrates about 50% on how sensitive Logan is, and 50% on 'cleverly' introducing loads of other X-Men characters that don't do much.<br/><br/>Jackman. I'm very disappointed. If you cut together the few seconds of flashbacks in X2 and watch them in sequence, you will get a far better Wolverine Origin film than this arse hole of a film."

","I have been an avid fan of Wolverine for over 20 years and I've been waiting for this film to come out for about as long. Now, don't get me wrong, Hugh Jackman plays him very well and the 3 X-Men films are brilliant, but there are so many mistakes in this film its untrue.<br/><br/>First off, the year it starts is 1845 but James Howlett (Wolverine) wasn't born until late 1880's. Second, Victor Creed (Sabertooth) is NO relation to Wolverine at all. Third, Gambit??? What the hell happened there? Fourth, Agent Zero was German, not Chinese and his name is Christoph Nord, NOT David North...I could go on but I wont.<br/><br/>I will say its a good film if you're not a true Wolverine fan that knows all the back story but if, like me, you are a hardcore fan, don't expect anything that you'd expect to expect...if that makes sense?"
"thefilmguy7","4","0","2","15 July 2009"," X Men Origins: Wolverine was a disaster!
","I'm sorry to report that all of the terrible things that critics have been saying about this movie are all totally true. A major let down. I grew up a huge fan of Wolverine. As a kid I collected the comics and they were my favorite from X Men because they were darker and more psychological. When the movies came around they reignited my interest in the character. The movies changed some aspects of his personality and such but I thought that in general the character was treated with a lot of respect. Especially the first two with the third film being a bit of a disappointment. When I found out about this Wolverine movie I was immediately excited about it. Especially after the first awesome trailer came out, which very deceivingly, made the movie look like it was taking a cue from Batman Begins and handling the material with great respect. The more I read from the filmmakers the more I got pumped because they went on and on about how faithful they were going to be and how mature the film was going to be. It was my number one pick for the summer. <br/><br/>Then the reviews started to come in and almost all of them were bad. I kept hoping that the critics were wrong but my interest in the movie did get shaken. It's a good thing too because had I seen this movie with the amount of faith in it that I had then I might have thrown burning fuel at the projector. Even with lowered expectations the movie was a massive disaster. They were neither faithful, dark, or mature in how they handled the movie. The whole movie is pretty much a spit into the face of the fans of Wolverine. They turn the whole thing into one big promotion for other mutants and their possible spin off movies. They promised that they would make a deep psychological Wolverine and here they couldn't have failed any more in that attempt. I thought that this was going to be as epic as Batman Begins and instead it was about as epic as a Saturday morning cartoon. True Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber did the best they could but they were surrounded by one of the worst productions I've seen in a super hero film. <br/><br/>The script was filled with every predictable clich√© in the book. I felt like the whole movie script was a scrap book to previous action and comic films. The comedy was always misplaced and always fell flat. The direction was totally uninspired and unoriginal. The special effects are bad enough to earn a razzie award. There was a kid behind me that called out, those look like cartoons the first time Wolverine inspected his adamantium claws. If a kid can spot that out then that really tells you something. I have no idea where all of the money for budget went but it certainly wasn't much towards the effects. Last but not least, the movie totally butchers the back story to the character. For months I've been reading interviews with people from the movie promising that this movie was for the fans and how faithful they were going to be to the source material. They basically lied to everyone. The movie has none of the weight or depth that was promised. Having a running time of only 1 hour and 45 minutes was a pretty good indicator of that. This movie should have at least been 2 hours 10 minutes to fit in everything the way it was meant to be. <br/><br/>Marvel could have had themselves their own Batman Begins but instead have a film with depth of a cartoon. Now it's not the worst comic book movie of all time or anything but it's very far cry from the best. There are entertaining action scenes. Some small moments of something hinting at the depth that the whole movie should have had. It wasn't boring or anything. Just irritating. It's really a shame. I think if there was ever a movie that should be remade immediately then this would be it. There is an amazing film waiting to be made for Wolverine. This certainly wasn't it. If they just treat the material with respect they will be off to a good start. They should have paid Bryan Singer any amount of money that he wanted to come back for this. Or get Chris Nolan who of course is busy with Batman. Imagine how amazing this movie would have been though if Chris Nolan had been in charge. This movie was supposed to show the birth of Wolverine and instead I felt like I attended his funeral."
"Reel_starz","6","0","2","10 July 2009"," Despite some good moments, this superhero movie isn't so super
","I didn't expect much walking into the theater. In fact, until recently, I had no intention of seeing this movie unless it happens to be on TV. But, as things turned out, it was either this or Ghosts of Girlfriends Past or rewatching Terminator Salvation. I chose this.<br/><br/>And I must admit that it isn't as bad as I expected it to be. It had its share of praiseworthy moments, and even a few mild chuckles. The actors were decent for what they were given and many of the parts of the movie that worked were largely due to the charisma of the cast, especially Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds. Though he was adequate in the first three movies, I felt like this was the first movie where Hugh Jackman really became Wolverine, perhaps because the film focuses entirely on his character, whereas in the previous movies, there had been only limited attention given to the character of Wolverine, even though he is probably one of the most essential characters in the franchise. If it weren't for Hugh Jackman, Wolverine would almost certainly feel like a one-dimensional character. If given a better script, he might have really made Wolverine a noteworthy character. There has been talk of another X-Men movie focusing on Ryan Reynolds's character, Wade/Deadpool, and it's not hard to see why. Although he's absent for the majority of the movie, in the few scenes he gets, Reynolds brings an energy to the screen that immediately attracts the audience to his character. In addition, while not quite as impressive as either of the aforementioned actors, Liev Schreiber is well-cast in the role of Victor Creed, Wolverine's brother. He exudes the right amount of menace without making his character a completely one-dimensional villain.<br/><br/>Of course, the special effects are pretty good, though sometimes it's a bit too heavy on the CGI. Many of the battle sequences are over-the-top and too long and a scene at the beginning showing the U.S. invasion of Normandy beach during WWII can't compare to the opening of Saving Private Ryan, though it's doubtful that the film-makers intended to surpass that classic scene.<br/><br/>I think the biggest flaws of Wolverine are 1) the fact that it felt like two-and-a-half hours, though in fact, the movie is only two hours long; 2) the script, which, while slightly better than the script for the previous X-Men movies, is unremarkable and often rather preposterous, particularly during the climatic battle, when it constantly resorted to contrivances; and 3) the fact that there are so many characters that we don't care much about any of them, though this is less of a problem than in the previous X-Men, where there were so many characters that it was hard to keep track of them all. Also, as in the other films, there was a weak performance or two and at least one unnecessary character. In the other movies, the weakest performance belonged to Halle Berry, who always felt immensely miscast and almost robotic as Storm, and there were too many unnecessary characters to count. In Wolverine, it's a contest between Lynn Collins as Silver Fox, Wolverine's obligatory love interest, and Taylor Kitsch as Gambit, though his poor performance could also be partly contributed to the fact that his character was pointless even for X-Men.<br/><br/>All in all, while it isn't a waste of money and time, thanks in large part to excellent performances from many in the cast particularly Jackman and Reynolds, Wolverine has numerous glaring flaws. Unless you are a fan of the X-Men comics or movies, wait until better movies come your way."

If you have seen the other X-men movies, it should be obvious that FOX has stopped caring if they make a good quality movie; now, all they seem to care about is making the movie just barely good enough to pass and then market the hell out of it too make a quick buck - rinse and repeat. I'm not saying this is a absolutely horrible movie - I kinda liked it - but it annoys me when its obvious the movie could have been 10x better with a bit more effort.<br/><br/>Let me hit my main points:<br/><br/>1.) The Visuals (Spoilers): I had the ability to watch the leaked rip of this movie however when I learned that large parts of the rip had only early stages of CG rendering, I decided just to wait for the theater release. However, I couldn't help but notice some glaringly bad graphics in the theater:<br/><br/><ul><li>When Wolvering is playing with his metal claws in the old couple's bathroom... it was very noticeable that Jackman's hands were out of sync with the CG claws.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The part where Logan rapidly chops up the ladder Gambit was on looked absolutely horrible. </li></ul><br/><br/>These are only two examples, but there is no excuse that for a ""big budget"" movie and 4th in a series to have such basic technical problems.<br/><br/>2.) Usage of Mutants - First, let me say that an entire movie could have been made just using Logan and Creed and I would have been happy. For example, the opening of the movie showing the two going through time might have been my favorite part. Now, the thing that really bothers me is the level of advertisement that FOX aimed at Deadpool and Gambit. If you take the screen time of those two in Ads it nearly equals the screen time in the movie - this is unacceptable. If such popular characters are going to play such a small role why not use lesser known mutants; the die-hard fans will be happy and the rest of the viewers wont even notice the difference and also be happy. X-Men(1) had the perfect amount, a core group of big names and a few secondary ones. X2 (the best) kept the core group and simply added a few more big names. Then X3 started to go crazy with it, which has carried over to Wolverine.<br/><br/>3.) Ending Frustration: (Major Spoilers) - So from what I could tell... at the end ""The Deadpool"" was constructed to have all sorts of powers yet it seemed he used about 3 or so. Also... I don't like it when a villain is built up so much and then dies in 4 minutes (like Venom in Spiderman 3).<br/><br/>4.) Final thoughts: In the end I didn't hate the movie. I should not have to wait for the DVD to get the quality version. A movie can take more money and time to make and still net a ridiculous profit (ex: The Dark Knight). FOX needs to stop the X-Men series... take a step back... and reset their thinking (longshot I know).<br/><br/>-AX"

","Ultimately disappointing. It's a shame when Hollywood takes an origin story and turns it into a dumbed down action movie. I'd still say see it only for Jackman and Schreiber. But, as a big fan of the comics and the other films, I'd say they fell short here. Sadly. Too much action without character development is not advisable for the creation of Wolverine. Since we don't know where he came from, why not come up with a better history instead of the contrived opening sequence which I still don't understand. Is he immortal? How was he used in the particular wars if he is mortal? Didn't he become, not immortal, but self healing after the operation? But he can still die. Isn't that the whole idea?

","Being a Huge fan of the X-men Franchise from childhood , I was completely disappointed with the X-men Movies and in no sense is the feeling any different for X-men Origins. Perhaps the only reason I found any level of entertainment was the fact that Hugh Jackman carried the entire movie franchise as Wolverine -the only character that was given proper screen time and Jackman mastered his role so well that without him this movie would have been a financial failure.<br/><br/>Gavid Hood's direction is highly average. His lack of experience on commercial filmaking is shown here with small scenes where brilliant levels of cinematic creativity is shown. Apart from a couple of really well directed scenes this movie falls flat on its face. The main reason is that the story and screenplay is heavily altered as compared to its comic book counterpart. Many major marvel characters are not given enough screen time .Players like Deadpool and Gambit who are legendary marvel characters are portrayed in such a way that they are merely there to fill the frame. The screenplay itself when studied with detail reveals itself to be a mere story of redemption - a genre that was innovative 20 years back .<br/><br/>Another major ,major setback to this movie are the CGI scenes which look way too fake . Maybe the budget didn't allow high level of technical CGI but still Gavid Hood should have commissioned to take care of this situation .Instead we are left with green screen caliber stunts and digital adamantium claws.<br/><br/>In short this will seriously disappoint Wolverine fans but for the rest of the crowd its a no-brainer"
"EUyeshima","5","0","2","31 May 2009"," A Convoluted and Wearing Flick Despite Jackman's Familiar Seething and Clawing
","I don't think this strenuous 2009 offshoot of the ""X-Men"" series should be dismissed entirely, but it really doesn't contribute much to the genre the way ""Iron Man"" and ""Batman Returns"" did last year. Both of those films set a high water mark for comic book franchises, and unfortunately director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"") can't seem to get his film-making arms around what would make Wolverine a compelling character over the course of 107 minutes. Don't blame Hugh Jackman, who puts in a valiant effort now in his fourth familiar turn in the title role. Addressing the inner demons of a conflicted character should have been within Hood's oeuvre given his previous serious-minded work, but he seems overwhelmed by the film's persistent blockbuster aspects. Fight scenes seem identical with each other, and there are lots of them here, so much so that the net result is more wearing than enthralling with the choreography and special effects looking the same from scene to scene. There are also new characters constantly introduced, each with some unique superpower of dubious distinction, so the story starts to feel like a springboard for yet more franchises.<br/><br/>Given that I am not familiar with the X-Men series, I will trust that screenwriters David Benioff (""The Kite Runner"") and Skip Woods have remained faithful to the comic book with the convoluted storyline, a true chore to follow for the uninitiated like myself. The opening sequence shows Wolverine as a sickly child sometime in the middle of the 19th century. Along with his brother Victor, he has apparently fought every major war since the Civil War, both getting killed and resuscitated for their next enlistment. The immortality aspect is probably the most problematic aspect of the story since it really doesn't give the viewer any legitimate reason to be concerned with Wolverine's ultimate fate. Consequently, the story focuses the conflict more on Wolverine's soldiering for the government and his growing identification as a mutant. This inner turmoil tears the brothers apart since Victor cannot forgive his brother for deserting the military. However, living peacefully as a poor lumberjack in Canada with his comely schoolteacher girlfriend Kayla does not prevent him from being drawn back to the cause as a member of an elite mutant unit due to the persistent efforts of Colonel Stryker.<br/><br/>Even if abject alienation is still not his forte, Jackman does what he can with a rage-filled cardboard role that requires him to alternate between vindictive and sympathetic in lightning flashes. In an exasperating turn, Liev Schreiber has even less latitude as Victor (a.k.a. Sabretooth) since we never figure out why he turns so completely malevolent. Danny Huston fares better as Stryker since the character is rich in Machiavellian tendencies that are easy to root against. Lynn Collins plays an ambiguously dichotomous role similar to Eva Green's in the James Bond vehicle, ""Casino Royale"", and Ryan Reynolds has a near-cameo role as yet another comic book franchise in the making. He provides some much needed comic relief, but it's not enough to offset the constant mayhem. The explosion-driven helicopter chase and the relentless fight atop the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor are the only set pieces that linger in the memory. The rest of the movie will have greater resonance for devoted fans of the comic book."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","3","30 May 2009"," Lacking characterisation and originality
","After the original three ""Star Wars"" movies, there was a long interval and then we had another three providing the back story to the initial trilogy. After the original three ""X-Men"" films (2000, 2003 & 2006), it looks as if - after a mere three year wait - we're going to have another series explaining how the various mutants acquired their special powers, starting with the steel-clawed Wolverine (the Australian Hugh Jackman). The idea makes some sort of commercial sense, but one of the great strengths of the franchise was the variety of exotic powers on display and the interaction between their use by benevolent and evil mutants and an ""Origins"" series is always going to be weak on this dimension.<br/><br/>""Wolverine"" opens promisingly with a series of short scenes set in 1845, the American Civil War, the two World Wars and Vietnam war when Wolverine's brother-in-arms is the increasingly mean-minded Victor (an able Liev Schreiber). Government agent Stryker (Danny Huston) is the chief protagonist as he develops various mutant powers, but we are missing impressive female characters this time with a weak Lynn Collins as Kayla the only offering. There are some fun action sequences but, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the very best bits. So, in short, entertaining enough but well short of its potential to exhibit some real characterisation and originality.<br/><br/>By the way, if you sit all the way through the credits (as I always do), you'll see a tiny clip which acts as bridge to the first ""X-Men"" movie."
"Scatterpulse","6","0","3","28 May 2009"," Most predictable. movie. ever.
","Okay, my title is a little unfair; this is by far NOT the most predictable movie ever, but it was extremely annoying to be sighting the ""plot twists"" a mile away at every turn. I mean, seriously: <br/><br/>1) Logan's wife is ""killed"" off screen. Did anyone actually think she was dead at this point? Really? When a key character is killed off screen, they are NEVER really dead.<br/><br/>2) Stryker is manipulating Logan. It's obvious. Evil military sp00k is never on the ""good"" side of the film. Predictable movie conventions 101.<br/><br/>3) Kayla is manipulating Wolverine. Come on! She tells the story of the trickster! What'd you think was going to happen? <br/><br/>4) The big fight scene at the end. Oy. This isn't a general movie convention so much as an X-Men movie convention. In every X-Men film there is a huge fight scene wherein a bunch of adolescent mutants are rounded up and freed/rescued by the good guys. When Logan initially begins exiting the facility I was actually genuinely impressed for a moment because I thought the director was bucking convention and opting out of the huge, dumb fight sequence. But then it happened. I could only sigh.<br/><br/>I'm also getting pretty annoyed with X-Men films that feature fan favorites in the trailers and then give them roles that barely qualify as cameos. The reason I actually saw this film was that I was thrilled to finally, finally, FINALLY be able to see Gambit on the big screen. I knew I would be disappointed, but I hoped that I would be able to at least enjoy it a little. The whole fifteen minutes that he actually spent on screen were just painful.<br/><br/>I shouldn't complain, though. At least he got more screen time than Cyclops. Or Emma Frost. Poor, poor Emma Frost fans.<br/><br/>The plot is...acceptable, I guess. From what I gather, it's actually pretty factually sound as far as the Wolverine back story goes, what with the relationship between Victor and Logan, etc. I'm not that huge of a Wolverine fan, so I'm basing this on an obsessed friend's word.<br/><br/>The CGI is okay. At some points it becomes jarringly terrible, though (I'm going to cite the bathroom scene when Wolverine first takes a look at his brand new shiny claws).<br/><br/>The acting is good. As always, Hugh Jackman is amazing.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also pretty good. Not spectacular, but good.<br/><br/>This film can be really enjoyable if you're prepared to just turn your brain off and watch a bunch of explosions and crazy fight sequences. Which, in all fairness, is what most people want to do. But for those of us who relish character development and intriguing plot lines, this movie is a little jarring."
"stevefriars","5","0","3","27 May 2009"," Less than evolutionary
","This first spin-off from the X Men series has Hugh Jackman reprising his role as everyone's favourite pointy-haired, pointy-knuckled mutant with anger-management issues, and, like Batman Begins, attempts to fill in the character's troubled back-story prior to the launching of his superhero career. Unfortunately, it also attempts to shoehorn in every character from the X Men comics who got left out of the first 3 movies, apparently in an effort to tickle the comic book fan-boys in the audience, and the resulting film, while not as muddled as the over-stuffed X Men: The Last Stand, still suffers from an excess of awkwardly contrived super-cameos that detract from, rather than add to, the story. Moreover, like many prequels (e.g. Star Wars) it contains some whopping inconsistencies with events in the earlier/later episodes that leave you wondering if the writers even bothered to watch the other X Men films before penning the script for this one. (E.g. - William Stryker's involvement with Sabretooth in this movie simply contradicts his ""I thought you were the only one of your kind, Wolverine"" line in X2.) And there are some plot-holes you could drive a truck through. (Adamantium bullets?!?)<br/><br/>On the plus side, it moves along at a fair old pace, there's plenty to look at, and it weighs in at just 90 minutes, which, in this age of over-long, ""epic"", posterior-numbing blockbusters like Pirates of the Caribbean, is something one can be truly grateful for.<br/><br/>All told, not a dreadful movie, but way below the standard set by Bryan Singer's first two."

","This fourth X-Men film, first chronologically, covers the history of arguably the most popular X-Man: Wolverine. While this idea is really cool, the film definitely falls short of that marker. While the X-Men trilogy (well, maybe not the third) were actually really good movies that not only had plenty of action but also were thought-provoking and deep. In X-Men Origins: Wolverine, even the action isn't very good. Like Batman Begins before, most of the fights consist of the camera zooming in too close and spinning constantly, not allowing a good view of what's going on. Even the special effects are lacking, as Wolverine's claws just seem tacked on and out of place most of the time. Hugh Jackman gave 110% in this film, but it didn't really help because apart from his performance the film was barely watchable. None of the mutants apart from Wolverine were explained well at all, even his brother Sabretooth was vague. There will be other X-Men Origins films and a fourth film in the main X-Men series as well as more Wolverine movie, but I can't say I'm looking forward to them. If anything, give this movie a rent when it comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray. It isn't worth seeing in the theater. Thanks for reading this review."

","Wolverine isn't a terrible movie, it just feels rushed and underdeveloped. The movie details Wolverines (Hugh Jackman) life from his first discovery of his claws to when he ends up at the start of X-men with no memory of who he is and how he ended up indestructible. The main problem i had with this is that i feel that the writers just sat around and brainstormed ideas, then put them all in and based the plot around the random scenes. To their credit, they were successful to a point. Early scenes featuring team X are great and feel perfect but after Wolverine leaves the team and becomes a lumberjack(!?) and his girlfriend gets killed, the movie just becomes random mutant scenes stitched together with a very loose motive from the badguy. (The villains do a lot to get Wolverine to undergo the metal bonding process then immediately try to kill him 2 seconds later). It's unfortunate that all of the fights in this movie are a let down except for Wade Wilsons (Ryan Reynolds) and the final fight which is stupid but also fun involves Wolverine and Sabertooth teaming up to then fight a remote controlled Wade who is now deformed and programed to kill Wolverine (And he has other powers and no mouth). It was a huge waste to turn Wade who was the best character in the film into a deformed drone and because you like him so much you don't exactly want him to die. <br/><br/>Overall, if you don't look too far into this then chances are you will enjoy yourself but don't expect the awesomeness of X2 to be re-created here."

"Otoboke","Null","0","3","18 May 2009"," A safe-play X-Men movie that feels like it was made in the nineties.
","When it comes to superhero action flicks, you know you're in for a rough ride when the central character that you are supposed to be invested in, too often becomes as out-of-place and jarringly disconnected as the CGI that tries to hide his lack of dimension. Sure, it's well known that most superhero origin stories are more often that not riddled with mundane exposition material and lame excuses for drama‚Äîyet it would seem that X-Men Origins: Wolverine likes to take this to the extreme. And yet, that rabid Wolverine himself, Logan is tepid at best. With perfunctory drama that never convinces of its value to character or plot, plus action that stupefies more than compels, Wolverine as it stands it merely an exercise in extremes. Not only this, but never before has the savage and tortured animal come off as toothless and neutered as he does here; this is a safe-play X-Men movie that feels like it was made in the nineties‚Äînot quite the gritty and dark comic book action movie that it should be considering both the lead character the world of superhero movies as they stand today.<br/><br/>Telling the story of how Marvel's trademark bad-boy James Howlett a.k.a. Logan, a.k.a Wolverine eventually inherited his superpowers, disdain for life and easily-excited temper, X-Men Origins tells a story that has been told to death. Within this largely ho-hum retelling involving numerous moments of extreme grief for the character, there exists a slowly beating heart of sorts‚Äîthis is the core of Wolverine's character of course, and his reason for receiving his own film in the first place‚Äîbut not only is this core only vaguely referenced throughout the course of his latest feature, but when it is called into play, the result is almost always forced and completely disposable. So instead, what writers David Benioff and Skip Woods do is put all the focus largely on the cold-exterior of Logan; on his thirst for revenge against evils that he had left long ago.<br/><br/>Sure, Wolverine has his demons, but we don't necessarily see them here. No, we see him growl, we see him gracefully walk from explosions like a true action superhero should (more often than necessary), and yes we hear him talk the talk; but was I at all moved by any of this? Did I find myself edging the man on? Did I want to see his brutal vengeance play out? No, I didn't. Why? Because Hugh Jackman bored me, and so did his character. Now let's get this straight; Jackman isn't a bad actor by any means, but he does have a tendency to suck the life out of every movie he takes part in. Much like the action and CGI that exists within the story of Origins here, the actor is flat and without any sense of conviction whatsoever. Wolverine on the other hand, is a character who does have his fair share of apathetic qualities which can make him hard to penetrate; but there is more to him than just grunts and anger. Benioff and Woods unfortunately, do not give any reason to believe so.<br/><br/>The action itself, which comprises of obvious CGI that looks rushed and careless with set pieces as ancient and unsurprising as the sunrise, is dull and repetitious with little in the way of excitement or elements to cling to. You see, without a character to root for and only the occasional sidekick to watch outdo Wolverine at every turn, the various loop-de-loops in action choreography and supposed climaxes are negated to mere distractions only‚Äîcut them, shove some music on them and they might provide at least base-level entertainment, yet as they stand provide no such thing. The only thing more disappointing than watching Logan however, is having to try and convince yourself that make-shift excuse for a bad-guy brother-turned-nemesis Sabretooth is in any way a serious threat or reason to care anymore about the fate of our protagonists. No, instead for the brief segments of screen time that they each receive, both Gambit and Cylops give the movie its only real taste of personality and intrigue on a more visceral level.<br/><br/>In the end, what X-Men Origins eventually boils down to is one big, ugly, contorted superhero movie clich√© that bumbles along minute after minute never doing anything significantly offensive, and yet never doing anything remotely interesting either. Stuck with a 12A certificate that more or less has the same effect of crushing Logan's claws and crotch simultaneously, what director Gavin Hood instead offers here is nothing of remote significance to Marvel fans, comic book fans or even action fans on the broadest of bases. The characters are flat, the action dull and predictable, and the drama (if it can even be called that) is just about the worst element of it all with tired plot devices and derivative contrivances that feel dated to the point of stultifying what could have even been a good fun, gung-ho action flick.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","I personally went into this movie not expecting something as good as the first two X-Men films, but I had high hopes for a decent film, and had heard a lot of good things about it from my friends. Many of my friends said it was awesome, they wanted to see it twice, etc. etc., so i figured, even if it's just flashy special effects it must be worth seeing.<br/><br/>However, while I don't regret seeing it, I must say it did not even meet the expectations I had for it.<br/><br/>It was far from being a horrible film. It was still a fun movie to watch, as it is part of the X-Men world, the character of Wolverine is still an interesting character and well acted as always by Hugh Jackman, and some parts of the dialog and some of the action was well done, but that is also partly the main problem of the movie: the good parts are scattered, rather than continuous throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Most of the film's plot seemed to be put together very quickly and not very carefully. The plot seemed to move way too fast, without really develop anything properly, and the filmmakers did not get everything they could out of each scene of the movie. There is very little suspense or build-up to anything. Some of the little things in the film that should be paid more attention to, like Wolverine's claws for example, are not really presented in the movie with the care and creativity that they should be, and also many parts of the movie were not taken seriously. Several of the scenes in the film were farcical, which can be a good form of comedic relief, but with a character and plot-line as dark as wolverine and his past, it seemed a little ridiculous.<br/><br/>This film also seemed to be used as a vehicle to throw other x-men characters onto the screen, perhaps just so that they could say they did. Most of these characters are given very little screen time and barely developed at all, and should either have been justified with a bigger part in the movie, or left out entirely.<br/><br/>The action in the film was half a strong point and half another weakness. Some of the fight scenes were exciting and fun to watch, but some of the stunts were somewhat cheesy, and most of the action scenes could have been built up a little better. Still, the action scenes were pretty much what most of the movie-goers went to the film for, and they did make the film watchable at least.<br/><br/>As far as dialog, the film contained both good dialog points and catchy one-liners as well as many parts where the dialog was dull...they could have definitely put a little more time into writing the script of the film but again it wasn't horrible. Just not nearly as good as the first two X-Men films.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave the film six stars for being enjoyable and a decent popcorn flick, but Wolverine is a very deep, very dark character that deserved a more well-thought out (not to mention grittier) script and a much more careful and thorough director. I would say go ahead and see it in the theater if you have a little extra cash but don't spend your last 7 dollars on it."

","This movie started out pretty great, but then seemed to be losing some steam by last 1/3 of the movie. Hugh Jackman was great as were his enemies (esp. Liev Schreiber who plays his brother) - all were believably villainous and intense, but somehow the story stopped being engaging. Things became so formulaic that I realized I've seen this plot line one too many times.<br/><br/>Basically, the story tells us the background story about X-Men character Wolverine's childhood through adulthood. He doesn't have a memory of his past and this movie tells us the story of why.<br/><br/>There's a great revenge-themed plot involved, but it just doesn't have a great crescendo. Wolverine/Logan's vengeance quest ramps up great in the beginning and middle, but seems somewhat empty or hollow afterwards. All the classic elements were there (hateful enemies, explosions, good people in jeopardy ... etc.) - but that's the problem - it's too formulaic ... to the point of being utterly predictable.<br/><br/>If you're an X-Men's fan, you've probably already seen this film (or nothing's going to stop you!), for everyone else - it's got some great action and F/X scenes that make a solid first half, but it delivers a story you've already seen a 100 times before."

The from Reno to New Orleans in a few hours? ...<br/><br/>Hollywood has once again failed me in a manner that makes me wonder: Why am I spending money at the movies anymore? Why am I even going out and wasting my money on big screen adaptations of my childhood that are only going to disappoint and criticize.<br/><br/>I can understand some nitpicking. I can understand some variations. But this is just at total departure of what was.<br/><br/>This movie would be great for a person who has no idea about wolverine or xmen...

","Origins was a good movie, but not as good as most people expected. One character, well, two characters are one in the same. Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) becomes Deadpool in the Marvel comics, but has nothing to do with Weapon XI. In the movie, six years after Wolverine and Sabertooth's glory days with William Stryker, Wade Wilson is kidnapped and has a lot of mutant powers pooled into him. This is how he becomes Deadpool or Weapon XI. I'm not sure if there will be a sequel of some sort in which Weapon XI becomes the original Deadpoool or not, but even though movies don't always follow story lines, this one was destroyed. Throughout the Marvel comics, Deadpool pops in and out, but how would he be able to do that if his body is lying decapitated in the ruins of a nuclear reactor? Other than that, the movie was fairly good, but if you are a comic book fan, wait until it comes to DVD."

","Wolverine certainly starts strong with an incredible opening credits sequence to rival that of Watchmen and we learn the sordid past between Sabretooth and Wolverine in a very short space of time without it feeling rushed. <br/><br/>I must say, for the most part, the first half of the movie is pretty good, we see the morals Logan holds and Jackman portrays this very well, along with all the emotional angst in his life which is incredibly believable the whole way through. However lackluster performances from the other mutants that seem randomly thrown in detract from this in a major way. I do like how names and places aren't rubbed in the audience's face saying ""Look how many mutants are in this movie!!"" but they may as well have. <br/><br/>Until the halfway mark, things are very well done, it's more story- driven than effects driven which makes for a competent film. About the point where Gambit is introduced is where it all goes to pot. Story elements are thrown pointlessly in left, right and center, special effects are throw in for the sake of having them (with some very, very dodgy, obviously green screen moments), the climax is a complete flop and it all takes, dare I say, the believability away from the movie.<br/><br/>And I think that's my main point. The story was believable because Hugh Jackman does do an incredible job and you really feel for his character and his very sad past. But even his acting skills cannot save the sordid mess that was hastily pasted on top.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Wolverine is an okay film. Not amazing but not horrific. It's better than X-men 3, but it turns into a very similar film near the end which nearly ruined everything good it had going for it."

","Well I would have to say the movie line itself was good, but a lot of people also go to see a good looking movie. I do graphics, I know people that are learning CAD programs that could have done this. I agree with what the person before me said, I would go see this movie, but it is the cheapest movie I have seen. I collect movies and watch them, I have around 6000 I own. Only thing I would say is if you want to give your money to people that already have money and make them rich on a picture that didn't cost that much, other then paying the actors, go ahead. I would like to see the graphics redone better, then it would be a great movie. It doesn't deserve the XMEN logo to me."

","In the middle of watching X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, I had this feeling like I'd seen it before. It was the 10:15am showing on opening day, so that wasn't right. But since the first X-MEN installment some 10 years ago, there have been quite a number of films in the superhero genre. Before that first X-MEN, it was pretty difficult to get it right; up until then, I wasn't sure anyone except director Richard Donner (SUPERMAN) had a clue what makes a hero super, or what makes a movie about that hero a good one.<br/><br/>These days, I'd say that Hollywood's got it down cold. They can crank these superhero flicks out with quite a bit of money and not a lot of thought. It's a science. Which is kind of how it felt to watch WOLVERINE. Steely cold science. Impressive at times, sure, but not a surprise. Thrill ride? Sort of. Maybe more like building the roller coaster than riding it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, everything looked great. The score was another solid one from Harry Gregson-Williams. The sound design was crisp and in-your-face, like it should be with a modern action film. Plus, we actually had some acting from, you know, actors (I'm talking specifically about Liev Schreiber - and now I like him as an action guy too). There were even a couple of (small) surprises along the way. It was by no means unpleasant. It just wasn't SPIDER-MAN 2. Actually it reminded me at times of watching ""Heroes"" on TV. But with more money on the screen. Lots more.<br/><br/>We're now at a point where the whole superhero movie genre has laid out one big formula for itself. Going beyond that for the screenwriters and directors doing new superhero movies is going to be a tough nut to crack. DARK KNIGHT showed us it was possible (although I'm not admitting it was entirely a break from formula as some have claimed - just that it did a better job at enhancing said formula). WOLVERINE does not, however, move us beyond what's already been done and said about heroes. It's just ""this year's model"".<br/><br/>I still had fun. I didn't feel cheated. But another one like this, and maybe I will. Six out of 10 stars."
"Parintachin","2","0","5","5 May 2009"," The power of advertising.
","I must say I'm impressed with the power of advertising. <br/><br/>This movie is terrible. <br/><br/>The script is a series of clich√©s bloated to the bursting point, served with a non-existing plot, a dipping sauce of continuity errors and a side dish of pure undiluted stupidity.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman plays a soft-hearted lumberjack on steroids. He is obviously a satisfied family father, and is about as believable trying to fill wolverines shoes as Meg Ryan would be. <br/><br/>Turning this into something people will waste their time and money on is a feat in and of itself."

","10 Stars: 2 Based on Movie Genre, 2 Based on World of the Story, 2 Based on Acting, 2 Based on Story, 2 Based on Filming. We add math to subtract the fun.<br/><br/>Genre: How does this movie rank compared to action movies. Well the fact is it was no Die Hard, so 2 stars is out the window. The action is constant, but repetitive. (If you jump at the last moment things work out.) I think if I was going to judge the battles on an artistic composition scale they'd do well, but all and all the movie only gets 1 star from me as an action movie.<br/><br/>World: So how does this stick to the comics. Within reason I think this was admirable and gratuitous. Wolverine vs. Sabertooth basically saves the movie while the added element of Silver Fox and Deadpool don't hurt. What hurts the movie is adding characters poorly and for no reason. Why are these people in the movie? Blob and Wraith are important as members of Stryker's task force, but they are worthless additions when they re-appear. GAMBIT HAS NO POINT IN THIS MOVIE!!!. The time wasted in New Orleans should have been used on the original task force. Again they only got it half right, 1 star.<br/><br/>Acting: So in action we will ignore all stupid scream at the camera moments. I don't think anyone's acting was bad, but I was a bit bothered by some casting choices. Gambit should have sounded Cajun and Stryker should have looked a lot more like Agamemnon from Troy.<br/><br/>Story: Pre-Title... Howlett appears to be a good father but the relationship is glazed over and rather then focus on the ORIGIN we rush right to Wolverine killing his biological father. The credits were brilliant and were my favorite part of the whole movie. The task force was glazed over I don't think the writers cared about us understanding the plot points. They just hit them and moved on. Wolverine + Silverfox was a nice touch and a good nod to Wolverine's actual time in British Columbia. The story moves logically and inefficiently along following Wolverine as he tracks down Stryker and saves the day. Just for a bit of chronological fun. Xavier must be pretty old when he meets Magneto because he was walking at three mile island. 1.5 Stars.<br/><br/>Filming: So this was filmed in an acceptable way but reminded me too heavily of Michael (can't direct) Bay. Yay! It sploded! 1.5 Stars."

","So where do I begin with X-men Origins: Wolverine. Well as X-pected it's not that good but also it's not as bad as everyone says. The main problem is that the script is awful and nowadays it seems no one is bothered with continuity as characters contradict themselves from one sentence to the next. Once again they have messed with the mythology and not taken into account any of the other films already existing in the universe. Then there's the pointlessness, like climbing to the top of a power station chimney for a showdown not because it's intrinsic to the plot but because it looks a bit better than fighting on the ground. The opening credits lead you into a false sense that this might actually be great but the realisation quickly hits you as you plod through Logan's past, even to the point where Jackman starts to seem bored by where he came from and in need of some action. But that's the crux of it, the film moves along almost at a flat line pace, nothing really happens which is o.k. for say 'Old Joy' or 'Wendy and Lucy' because that is the style of those films but for all the characters, effects and budget I don't think that was the desired affect here. Hairy Hugh saves the film in places with a mouth as sharp as his claws and he certainly looks good in his tight white vest, but the rest of the cast is poorly used and Gambit, The Blob, Bolt, Deadpool and even Sabretooth to name but a few don't really get a look in. I would have preferred a film following Stryker's special unit in Vietnam before they all went their separate ways and as the raid on the diamond factory in the film proves it would have been much better. Ultimately this feels like a wasted opportunity, it has all the elements but for some reason can't seem to gel them together to form a cohesive whole, that said I enjoyed it more than 'The Dark Knight'. Roll on Iron Man 2."

","Why this movie was made as opposed to another film which brought the X-Men team back together again, I don't know. What I do know is that while I had my reservations about X-Men Origins: Wolverine, overall it turned out to be an O.K. movie. I'm not saying that this film is as impressive as Iron Man or the previous three X-Men films, but it still gets the summer movie season kicked off on a fairly decent note. <br/><br/>While I was entertained, the movie was not without its problems. Firstly the special effects were really bad by today's standards, as well the story never seemed to build up to anything; it's comparable to an orchestra playing a symphonic piece and playing it as loud as possible for the entire time. Still, with these few minor gripes aside the film still managed to satisfy the audience.<br/><br/>The action was entertaining to watch unfold and also the dialogue in many spots was quite clever. Overall I'd recommend seeing this film. While it is a far cry from any of its predecessors, it still packs enough punch to let the audiences know that summer is finally here.<br/><br/>I give X-Men Origins: Wolverine a 6 out of 10!"

","Logan and Victor are mutant brothers with extraordinary abilities that make them a valuable asset to their country. Having trained as soldiers for over a century and facing certain death during the Vietnam War, they eventually attract the attention of William Stryker, a military scientist who recruits them to join a special team of the most highly skilled mutants. When Logan chooses to follow his own path, he becomes the target of Victor's fury which leads to tragedy. Embittered, Logan volunteers for Weapon X, an experimental program that makes him indestructible and the perfect weapon to combat his reprehensible brother. Prequel to the X-Men trilogy has an intriguing story and two formidable leads but suffers from cardboard characters and poorly choreographed action scenes; needs better direction, but there are still enough flashy visual effects to please the eye and make it worth the viewing experience. Not particularly memorable, but not without entertainment value either. **¬Ω"
"H_Spengler","6","0","3","2 May 2009"," Not bad overall, but lacking dimension
","Not a bad story overall, but I do have some nit-picky items i'd like to list.<br/><br/>The Good: Jackman: Besides being pumped up visual eye candy, makes the character of Wolverine his own yet again. I thought he was fabulous in the X-Men movies, and he does a great job overall here too.<br/><br/>Schreiber: Made a great and convincing Sabretooth. The chemistry he shared with Jackman was spot on and they worked well together.<br/><br/>Reynolds, Kitsch, Monaghan, etc.: All the mutants who made an appearance in this film were great. I've no complaints as far as their depiction or who was assigned to play them. <br/><br/>The scenery (esp. in Canada) is gorgeous and scenes are well shot. The musical score is impressive, battles are well done and engaging. The Adamantium scene is awesome and everything it should be. The opening credit scene depicting his long lifetime involving all these different wars is great.<br/><br/>The Bad: Writing: was lacking and wooden in many spots, it left you wanting for something more, for the money and team they had invested in this, I honestly expected something better. Some of the dialog honestly had me wincing ""Walk until your feet bleed.....then....keep on walking."" Would be a good example.<br/><br/>Too many shots of Wolverine looking up and screaming at the camera. He does it like 4 times...how many are really needed to add a dramatic effect?! He does it as a child over the body of his ""father"", over the body of his girlfriend, etc. <br/><br/>Lots of great characters, yet fails to really flesh out any of them. I'm just really not convinced enough of anyone's emotions to motivate their situation. Characters just seem to ""do"" things, and with a ""rushed"" feeling. Stryker is really the only one who's drive for what he's doing seems deep and driven. Even Wolverine is a SLIGHT casualty to this. <br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen more of Deadpool (who could seriously have a whole movie devoted to him.), and Gambit.<br/><br/>Even the ""death"" of his girlfriend didn't convince me that was enough to drive Wolverine to the extreme and life altering decision to have that Adamantium grafted to his skeleton, it just seemed that there should have been more. Although I admit, I couldn't wait for the razor claws first appearance, or the metallic ""ping"" that accompanied something or someone hitting him.<br/><br/>Also, was Scott able to see through the visor device implanted on him by Stryker? I wasn't clear on that....if yes, than wouldn't he have recalled Wolverine later? It's not everyday that a buff, big haired, metal clawed guy frees you from a prison. My friend who went with me was pretty sure he couldn't see, but I think if he was safe wearing a $5 pair of ray bans to high school and was OK, then he was able to see through that special ""visor.""<br/><br/>I know some people have complained about the beginning story, but it's pretty accurate to the ""Origin"" comic. The bone claws, the killing, etc. So I don't have much complain about on that end other than, it's never explicitly stated that Wolverine and Sabretooth are brothers, it's implied, also they left out the ""Rose"" character, who turns out, even after her death, to play an important role in Wolverine's psyche throughout his life. I think it would have been nice to include her. <br/><br/>Overall though, it's not a horrible movie, the effects are great, and are never too over the top. Jackman is great, but what it's lacking does show through in areas. 6/10"

","I can't believe marvel would ever let this happen to wolverine. This movie deserves a redo. This wolverine movie is such crap that it deserves to be mentioned along with superman returns, Elektra, Brian Singer, Dare devil, Ghost Rider, Uwe Boll, and Batman and Robin,oh yea spawn. watching this movie makes you feel the greed, the wanton lust for cash, the temptation of easy money that the investors are salivating over. I urge you all not to watch this movie, if possible wait for it in HBO, don't even buy the DVD,... this crap deserves to be pirated, this is an outrage. quite disappointing since heath ledger's performance in the Dark knight, you'd think that Hugh Jackman would at least try, but its as if he knew that this was already crap to begin with. Quite a pity, that just last year after iron man, the dark knight, the incredible hulk and the transformers, we all thought that they already figured out how to make a decent superhero movie, even the punisher war-zone got it right this time around. I really hope that this movie undersells."

","For me, the worst part of this movie are the adamantium bullets. Aside being obnoxiously ""typical"", they are profoundly WRONG. And in case you don't know, I'll tell you why. Bash two chunks of cheese into one another. They crumble. Do the same with two diamonds: it feels sure that adamantium bullets bounce off adamantium. This may be a fictional universe filled with extravagant rules of how ""mutants"" work, but that doesn't excuse an extravagant logic system.<br/><br/>In this case, one show of stupidity is enough to describe the tone for the way the entire movie is carried out. They really didn't think the scenes through. Or the entire story for that matter. The film is cheaply structured, but I found myself compelled to watch it all, rather to see Wolverine. That is what the film is all about.<br/><br/>Some people say his ""brother"" is played well, however the motivation for Victor's extreme murderous acts are thin.<br/><br/>They could have taken the story beyond a never ending series of betrayals and illogical ""spare your life"" scenes. Why would anyone spare someone when they know he was going to keep killing people no matter what? Or walk away for a second, third, n-th time? Wolverine is the anti-hero type, but not in this movie. The same goes for his girlfriend at the end.. merely to fit the story with X-Men 2. It could have been done a million better ways.<br/><br/>There is something very wrong in the way directors think: the hero kills dozens of henchmen, then out of the righteousness of his heart spares the boss. Again and again if he has to.<br/><br/>While the film was rolling with several choices for Logan to make at key points in the plot, some of the outcomes were guessable, possible, although one or two of them surprised me. Even with that, in the end, there is little to be labeled as smart, educational or inspirational about it, you just get to see another Wolverine film, this time just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>After having another look at the previous 3 X-men films, I take my vote down from 7 to 6. There are worse out there (they aren't called ""Origins: Wolverine"" or have cheesy fight sequences !). It is a relative score."

","My excitement slowly waned as the movie went on. Where was the tension? The mystery? Liev Schrieber was fantastic as Vincent/Sabertooth, Hugh Jackman was his usual good as Wolverine, but the rest of the characters just didn't seem to develop. I felt no connection to any of the mutants, nor could i muster much of an impulse to root for anyone's success. The tension between the members of Stryler's team made no sense. A little back-story to that would have been nice. I would have loved to have seen Gambit as a more integral part of the plot. He is, by far, my favorite mutant. Stryker was a disappointment. Perhaps it is hard to follow where Brian Cox has already trod? Ryan Reynolds was wasted on Deadpool. Why use such a strong and recognizable actor in such a minor roll? Yeah, it was fun, had a few chuckles. But, in the end, it was just another action movie that fails to live up to its trailer."

Not great. Better than X-men 3, but that's not saying much. Liev Schreiber (one of my favorite actors) pulled off Sabretooth nicely, and Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Wade Wilson. Will I Am did surprisingly well. The Blob was pathetic. Gambit was pretty cool, and there are some other cameos that played well.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's earnestness in Wolverine really helps. He seems to really love being that character.<br/><br/>A little disjointed at times (which often happens when you try to cram too many characters into a movie) and it looks like the money was cut off as some of the FX scenes toward the end are pretty weak.<br/><br/>I'd give it about a 6.5"
