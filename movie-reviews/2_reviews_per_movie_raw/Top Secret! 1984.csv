"the-jerk","10","163","185","11 April 2005"," an overlooked gem
","Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for ""Airplane"", ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"", and the ""Naked Gun"" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! <br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the ""Hotel Gay Schluffen"", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If ""Top Secret!"" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means ""She whose bosoms defy gravity""?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, ""Top Secret!"" IS one of the great comedies of our time."

My husband and I were laughing nearly the entire movie and I found myself repeating, ""What is even happening?!"" over and over.

"Backlash007","Null","98","118","26 August 2003"," ""What funny duck poop?""
","Top Secret is one of the funniest, most off-the-wall movies ever filmed. Featuring a young Val Kilmer, I think Top Secret is the best of all spoof films (Spaceballs is a close second).  This thing spoofs everything, Beach Boy's songs, spy pictures, war movies, westerns, and even Elvis is not safe. It's ridiculous, outrageous, hilarious, and all in the name of good fun. The spit gag has to be my favorite bit.  You've seen it in countless movies: the hero is being verbally accosted by the villain and he spits in his face. This time, however, the hero is on the other side of the room.  Other memorable jokes include the skeet songs, the anal intruder, the ""cow"" scenes, and the backwards bit with Peter Cushing.  There are countless little things like that which make Top Secret a definite cult classic and a certifiable must-see.<br/><br/>""Wish they all could be double barrel, wish they all could be double barrel guuuuuuuns."""
"Pedro_H","7","53","63","24 February 2004"," It doesn't get much sillier than this - and they even say so in song!
","An American rock and roll idol goes behind the iron curtain (while there was one!) for a culture fest but instead becomes involved in the resistance movement.<br/><br/>Forget about the film itself, the very idea of an Elvis Presley movie being mixed with a French resistance film and produced by the Airplane! crew is enough for laugh number one. Not only is this a bizarre world but seems to be playing games with time and history, the communist East Germany being portrayed as a kind of war time Nazi set-up!<br/><br/>Kilmer does well with an impossible role to the point where you wonder if he didn't miss his vocation. He can sing and dance better than many real singers and he proved in The Doors that he is really a major musical  force. Strangely it is rumoured that he didn't realise this was a satire!<br/><br/>The stupidity of many Elvis movies and those Saturday morning children's reels (scientist and beautiful daughter) are taken to the cleaners and you have fantastic sight gags. The ""falling guard"" gag is one of the best sight gags in the history of movies - I challenge anyone not to laugh at it.<br/><br/>I enjoy a stupid movie every now and then and admit I enjoyed this one. Clearly the authors know little about German history or  European culture and the little they do know seems cribbed from watching bad B movies on the subject, but what the hell. This is too stupid for anyone to get seriously uptight about. ""How silly can you get?"" sings Kilmer at one point in the film: Maybe a little, but not that much!"
"Aaron1375","8","40","48","23 April 2003"," The best spoofs...
","are usually the ones with plots of their own.  This one is such a spoof and it is very funny.  You don't have to see any movies to find this funny either.  You just have to have seen parts of an Elvis movie over the years or saw a scene or two from an old espionage flick.  You don't have to watch an entire movie to get the jokes.  Val Kilmer is very funny here as is all the cast.  The jokes are great even with some of them being a bit dated. The resistance group is great, the escape, everything in here is really funny.  After ""Airplane"" this one ranks right up there with the best spoof movies made."
"Motopsycho2","10","38","46","18 February 2007"," Comparable to great comedies like Airplane! and The Naked Gun.
","This movie truly is another great work from David Zucker and Jim Abrahams team. In some scenes you will laugh so hard that you have to pause the movie, laugh for five minutes then play it again. Also, Val Kilmer does a great acting for his first movie!<br/><br/>This movie may not be the best comedy ever made but it still is among the top of its genre and a great movie to watch even and specially if you're not in a good mood.<br/><br/>If you found ""Airplane!"" funny then watching this one is highly recommended. It has the same stupid and totally funny jokes and same sense of humor. It also is the best parody of WW2 spy movies. Rent or buy the DVD and enjoy it!"
"DarthBill","9","27","33","14 April 2004"," Batman meets Alfred!
","In his first leading role, Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an Elvis like pop star sent to Germany on a good will tour as a fill in for Leonard Bernstein. Once there he gets caught up in all sorts of misadventures that lead to him being a part of the French under ground resistance. Lucy Gutteridge is his German lover.<br/><br/>An often overlooked - maybe even misunderstood - film from the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker team (who gave us ""Airplane!"") the film takes pot shots at ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", pintos, rock 'n roll, Nazis, and other various spy movies with more gags than you can shake a stick at. A hilarious romp of madness.<br/><br/>Val himself is pretty funny here, managing to both wink and not wink at the camera as he is placed in a number of absurd situations. Also interesting of note is that this one features Michael Gough, who would later play Alfred in the Batman series, and Val himself would later play Batman."
"Nelson_Fluckz","10","62","86","11 July 2005"," Very funny and also very stupid...
","This movie is unbelievable funny and makes no sense.<br/><br/>Why are there Nazis in East-Germany capturing Scientists and why do they want to let a Rock'n'Roll singer play his music!? For me one of the funniest part is the ""german language cassette"" Rivers' is listening to in the train (!) to Germany. This words make absolutely no sense! :) The whole train sequence is funny. The train station and the guy with the tree also rock!<br/><br/>Val Kilmer did a great performance, acting, dancing and singing!<br/><br/>The title sequence ""skeet surfing"" is also a great parody for the American way of life!"
"claudio_carvalho","7","14","17","5 March 2016"," Val Kilmer Steals the Movie
","In East Germany, the American rock and roll singer Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) meets Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) in a fancy restaurant. Hillary is a member from the resistance and her hope is to rescue her father, the scientist Dr. Paul Flammond (Michael Gough), who is imprisoned by the Germans to develop a powerful weapon. Nick is arrested and sent to prison for helping Hillary and he meets Dr. Flammond in his laboratory. Hillary helps him to escape during a show and when he tells that he has met Dr. Flammond in the prison to Hillary, they decide to seek out the resistance leader. When they meet him, they discover that Nigel (Christopher Villiers) was Hillary's first lover. Further, they learn that there is a traitor in the resistance. Who might be the traitor?<br/><br/>""Top Secret"" is a very funny comedy by Jim Abrahams and David Zucker. The plot is a parody to World Was II movies with the French resistance and it is impossible not laughing along the adventures of Nick Rivers in the East Germany. Val Kilmer steals the movie wit ha magnificent performance and singing most of the songs. In the end, time is cruel to everyone. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Top Secret – Super Confidencial"" (""Top Secret – Super Confidential"")<br/><br/>Note: On 24 Sep 2017, I saw this film again."
"ElMaruecan82","10","20","26","13 February 2012"," Hilarious From A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker ...
","Following the popular success of ""Airplane!"" and its less acclaimed sequel, the ZAZ trio was back to what I believe to be the funniest comedy ever: ""Top Secret!"" a hilarious parody of the WWII spy films and the 50-60's rock-themed movies. Speaking of rock'n'roll, one of the most defining songs of the film performed by Val Kilmer aka Nick Rivers is titled ""How Silly Can you Get?"" which sounds like a self-reflexive motto.<br/><br/>""Top Secret!"" probably features the highest laughs-out-loud-per-minute ratio from any movie, as there is not one single moment where the action isn't punctuated by a gag, and that this very gag doesn't work. Everything in ""Top Secret!"" is both hilarious on an anarchic and cathartic level in the way it plunges you into a never-ending positive mindset. You may say that this is the very principle of a comedy, what's more a spoof movie, but it seems like ""Top Secret!"" has been specially concocted for pure and genuine amusement, and while the much more respected ""Airplane!"" has its slower moments, especially during the flash-back parts, ""Top Secret!"" was hilarious from A like Abrahams to Z like Zucker brothers.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of gags in ""Top Secret!"", the direct and the indirect one. The direct is immediate, mostly visual and slapstick, like a ""find him and kill him"" stamp or a sunbathing girl leaving boob-holes in the sand. The best gags are extended and feature a lot of dancing like the ball scene, the outrageous ballet sequence or a feet-view panic scene. Anyway, whether it's an offensive national anthem, a singing horse, a little German, an over-hilarious moment when Nick is about to be executed and an old lady slowly approaches to pick up the phone, any attempt to list the audio-visual gags of the film is as ludicrous as trying to define which is the funniest. The indirect gag is the elaborated one, already funny by itself but leading to a much more delightful punch-line.<br/><br/>The first one involves a weird shot illustrating the road taken by Nick Rivers and his manager, the map looks more and more familiar until Pac-Man makes his appearance, the very gag that sets the tone of the film. When Omar Sharif as Agent Cedric meets a colleague disguised as a party tricks vendor, the whole interaction is funny enough but the icing on the cake comes with the ""You dropped your phony dog pooh"", an item which obviously is not sold. The gag works even more because we expect it, like when Nick is introduced to the French Resistance, what would you expect from a man named ""Déjà Vu"" apart from ""Have we not met before?"" It could have concluded here yet the French sounding names punch-line was with the black guy named 'Chocolate Mousse"", which says a lot about an era where anything was acceptable in the name of pure comedy.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be too analytical, but my regard for ""Top Secret!"" is due to one of the two funniest and creative gags from any film, starting with the Swedish bookstore sequence, a cinematic achievement that would have made Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin proud. During that part, there is a gradual suspicion that we're not watching a normal scene, even for a spoof movie, there is something weird in the walking and the talking that gets funnier as it is more noticeable, the scene becomes hilarious when we get the point and yet it goes on and on, a book getting in the right place immediately, dust from ear to mouth, and finally Nick and Hillary 'sliding up' a pole. The sequence goes from funny to not funny anymore until it becomes funny again with the throw away gag of the puppy going backwards leaving the Swedish bookstore owner in a priceless doubted expression.<br/><br/>The other and maybe more memorable one, as it made it in the poster involves a clever cow disguise that looks like a real cow from our point of view, it's simple but someone should have thought about that. Now, it became a comedic landmark used in many comedies when a guy disguise as an animal, inopportunely choosing the female one, and invites a male on heat to come on him, but back then it was new that even pushed the outrageousness by involving a little veal thirsty for milk, the villain's reaction (in the disguise) is a laugh-riot. That's the secret of ""Top Secret!"", a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously except for its genuine desire to make us laugh. The rest of the gags are as good as it gets, and features many fourth-wall breaking, like when Nick and Hillary feels that the romance ""makes it's like a bad movie"" and then they look at us, and many film references are made, notably one hilarious climax in a sub-aquatic Western bar, and a clever farewell a la ""Wizard of Oz"".<br/><br/>""Top Secret!"" is made in such a way, that we either enjoy a gag or wait for one to come, so there's no time break. The only little pauses are provided by these moments when we can enjoy Val Kilmer's musical performances but the humor is never away. But my enjoyment of the film is proportional to my sadness to see it so often overlooked by the peers and movie viewers, playing on anagrams, I want to say that ""TOP SECRET!"" is a comedy ""TO RESPECT!"". Indeed, when I checked the list of AFI's Top 100 Laughs, I was surprised not to see ""Top Secret!"" listed while ""Fargo"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" and less 'lol'ling comedies were, I'm even surprised that the film is hardly mentioned among the greatest parodies or that it didn't have any nominations for the Golden Globes.<br/><br/>Seriously, I can't see, regarding ""Top Secret!"", how funnier can a movie get."
"ajdagreat","Null","34","49","3 February 2002"," very underrated
","The Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team, master of the rapid-fire humor and insane spoofs, strike again! This time with ""Top Secret!"", which is a very underrated movie that, in my humble opinion, is just as good as ""Airplane!"" (which of course is considered their best work). <br/><br/>I don't understand it - what makes this film inferior to ""Airplane!""? There are just as many jokes, the jokes are just as good, the timing is as always perfect. Am I missing something? Is it just that ""Airplane!"" was bold in breaking barriers for spoof movies, setting a precedent that ""Top Secret!"" was just there to follow?<br/><br/>That's not to diminish the quality of ""Airplane!"", which is one of my favorites. But what's wrong with ""Top Secret!""? Why only a 6.6 rating? It must be from those purists who don't understand movies like this, and don't like this movie because the plot is not as well-developed as the plot of ""Airplane!"" Don't get me wrong - ordinarily a more developed plot only makes a movie funnier, but in the case of a spoof like this, the plot isn't important (it has often been said that the plot is just a ""clothesline"" for the jokes in such movies). Those purists completely miss the point of this movie.<br/><br/>Watch this movie unless you're one of those blasted aforementioned purists. If that is the case, go watch ""The Philadelphia Story"" for the thousandth time."
"Jawsphobia","Null","14","21","17 August 2000"," Sheet Shootin' is a catchy tune
","The opening song which combines Beach Boys music with the subject of Skeet Shooting is worth the price of the movie and prepares you for the joyful insanity that will follow.  Kilmer is at his second best, after The Doors, with an Elvis Presley and Spy-Movie spoof.  This range of subject matter may account for the relatively low box office.  But when I hear the over-used title TOP SECRET this is the only thing that springs to mind.  There is a great BLUE LAGOON parody, which may be out of date, but with Survivor as the latest fad it may pass."
"Coventry","6","26","44","3 October 2004"," ZAZ Blitzkrieg-humor
","In between their most successful films  Airplane, Naked Gun and Hot Shots  the ZAZ team modestly spoofed the espionage and conspiracy theory thrillers in Top Secret! The film involves American teen idol Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer in his first big screen role) attending a culture festival in Nazified East Germany. The festival merely is a cover-up for the sinister and evil practices of the Nazis who kidnapped an eminent scientist. Nick quickly interferes in all this and ends up as member of a resistance-party, existing of French dudes with funny-sounding names and weird comical habits (like drinking gasoline) . Remaining loyal to the ZAZ trademarks, 'Top Secret!' is one giant running gag and a spitfire of chuckles in which absolutely NOTHING has to be taken seriously. The European-minded character of this film provided the writers with the occasion to make fun of the typical French, German and Swedish stereotypes and that forms a perfect contrast with the American surf-generation. As usual in this type of films, the widely elaborated jokes miss their target (sometimes they even are painfully unfunny) but the smaller background slapstick is hilarious and almost causes you a stomach pain from laughing. The open assaults to immensely successful cinema classics like 'the Great Escape', 'Wizard of Oz' or 'The Blue Lagoon' is something you either love or hate, but it perfectly reflects the type of over-the-top humor these writers want to bring. Val Kilmer does well in his first major role and his youthful charm helps increasing his teen-popstar credibility. Furthermore, there are a few delightful small roles for authentic cinema veterans such as Omar Shariff, Michael Gough and my personal favorite Peter Cushing. Top Secret isn't Abraham's and the Zucker brother's best work, but it's still great entertainment and the quality balances somewhere between 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' and 'Airplane'."
"lee_eisenberg","10","8","12","19 February 2006"," Keep rockin' and rollin' as long as actors can get elected president!
","Knowing that ""Top Secret!"" comes from the guys who gave us ""Airplane!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" movies, I shouldn't have to really explain it. The plot has rock 'n' roll star Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) getting sent to East Germany to rescue a scientist (Michael Gough). Of course in reality, the movie's an excuse for a gag every minute. Making fun of both the American and Soviet spheres of influence, this flick pulls no punches. I suspect that you'll really like the scene where Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) and Nick explain their names to each other, and then where they introduce the resistance fighters. All in all, a wonderfully goofy romp. As a side note, Val Kilmer and Michael Gough later co-starred in ""Batman Forever"", although Jim Carrey stole the show in that one."
"thesar-2","8","5","7","9 July 2010"," It's really no Secret why this movie's near the Top.
","Clearly, the writers of Top Secret! didn't know what decade they were spoofing. From 1950's dances and music to M*A*S*H and Mary Tyler Moore TV references to Satellites (?),Top Secret! simply got lazy at times. After awhile, you'll simply get used to them as none of this is really supposed to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>So, get past that, I did, and you'll have a freaking blast as the good enormously outweighs the flaws. Sure, some (make that few) of the jokes are corny, predictable and don't work (Val's head in the toilet would've been funnier animated – wait, it was, on Scooby-Dooweekly) but most will have you rolling – A new version of Frogger, Der Pinto, The Tunnel of Irony, Tic Tac Glass, just to name a very few.<br/><br/>American sensation, Nick (Kilmer) travels to Germany just as the rebellion builds up against the Nazis around World War II. He continually saves the damsel in many dresses while singing a few tunes and dances away unscathed. His mission, he didn't really choose, is to rescue the dame's imprisoned father and Batman's butler and escape East Germany.<br/><br/>Really, the plot doesn't matter and as slim as it is, it's actually more complicated than the highly superior Airplane! The real joy is seeing true slapstick as it was meant to be, unlike the failed attempts of recent years. And yes, they can make a spoof without Leslie Nielsen, though he's a big part of why most of them worked in the 1970's and 1980's.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a bang telling you it's a silly movie, it only has one shot that they looked at the screen – something I only like in very small portions – and when they did, it was absolutely hilarious and the movie kept to what it was: spoof of war films, or the war itself, or Nazis. In either case, it didn't go in 50 directions like recent and unbearable spoofs, like Scary Movie 2, 3, 4, etc.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for those who do love the 1980's, genuine spoofs and booted cows. Make sure you go to the special features on the disc – the deleted are really funny and I'm surprised they were cut, and there's an Easter Egg concerning yet another hilarious scene and its original format. One scene, I might have missed, but I recall a scene in which the table ""rises"" with the gentlemen's excitement and I didn't see it this time. I'll watch it again, but I'm kind of disappointed that wasn't here. AnywaysSEE IT!"

I was thinking of switching a channel, but then this movie finally became funny. There was so many stupid jokes, there was just no seriousness in this film, so just when I get used to it, it was really funny. I think that they used 500 jokes in this movie, or maybe more. They were parodying that time movies and using a good old slapstick jokes. So it's a really worth watching 80's comedy."

","""Top Secret!"" is a comedy that parodies spy films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team that created ""Airplane!"" (1980) and later the ""Naked Gun"" films. The story follows the exploits of Nick Rivers, played by Val Kilmer, as he gets tangled in a plot in East Germany. Strangely and amusingly enough, though, East Germany's officials deliberately resemble Nazis.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer does well with the humor and musical numbers in the lead. Lucy Gutteridge is also appropriate as Nick's love interest. The resistance members and East German/Nazi officers were all well-cast as well. There are some brief but nice appearances from Omar Sharif and Peter Cushing.<br/><br/>The film has a number of funny moments, such as the singing of the East German anthem or Nick's air duct escape. I also enjoyed the musical numbers, particularly ""How silly can you get?"" However, I didn't find this film to be as consistently funny as ""Airplane!"" or the ""Naked Gun"". ""Top Secret!"" effectively mocks spy films, but isn't as amusing as other films from the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team."

","One of the funniest movies of all time. Although it's so silly (""How silly can you get"") it's beyond silly, that is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It doesn't take long to get that this movie is all about the gags. Either you accept it and laugh your head off, or you turn it off. <br/><br/>Val Kilmer is perfect for the role that is not a role or a character at all - he's just hanging on for the ride of the Zuckers and is oblivious to it all. And that's what makes the movie (beyond the fantastic gags), because all the characters find the things that happens very real. Forget about Scary Movie or whatever stupid movie there is out there. This is THE silly movie of all time. It's better than Airplane!, the Hot Shots movies and the Naked Gund-movies. This is the movie that frees itself from every rule and setting and just play all the jokes it can master. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a parody of both Elvis-movies, war movies and spy movies, but at its core there's just true comedy with only one rule: There is no rules.

It's just not in the class of the best Abrahams and Zucker's, especially the fore- mentioned Airplane, hence my four stars.<br/><br/>Sent off to cold-war East Germany and playing rock'n'roll to an audience not yet immersed in such, at a concert that aims to unite west and east Berlin, Nick Rivers (Kilmer) encounters an array of mishaps, from the outset. Naturally, the opposite sort of happens and I'd like to say that plot details are fairly useless here and they're pointless in a script where gag after gag is out for laughs, most of them hitting some spot, or another. There's Omar Sharif as you've never seen, or ever thought you'd see him and a turn from Peter Cushing, too.<br/><br/>Venturing into a parody of WWII films, including The Great Escape, it ends up with a herd of cows wearing wellington boots...What happens between is fast and funny and whilst Top Secret isn't the funniest thing you'll see, it's good and worthy of including in the 'ones to see'."

Then the wooden expression vanishes and he's limber enough to give the impression that he can sing and dance with the best of them.<br/><br/>JEREMY KEMP does his best to look sinister as a Nazi officer and LUCY GUTTERIDGE is the pretty wide-eyed miss who gets Kilmer involved in a messy espionage situation. All of it is played for laughs and there are plenty of those, but I suspect this will appeal more to anyone who has experienced all the movies being parodied--even, for one fleeting moment, ""The Wizard of Oz."" Summing up: Some uneven moments but generally an enjoyable romp. Kilmer went on to better, more serious roles for the rest of his career."

","This is a genuinely amusing film from start to finish, and I think will ultimately be remembered as one of the best comedies of its era.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that some material could be tighter; that much of the humor is topical and now somewhat outdated; that the film lacks an inner cohesion, and thus comes across as a series of skits in many respects.<br/><br/>But lovers of comedy can forgive many of these faults - much of Fields is now outdated, Laurel and Hardy never showed concern for tight construction, the Three Stooges are frequently lacking in inner cohesion; yet they all made screamingly funny movies! All right, perhaps this isn't 'screamingly funny' - but it's dam'ed amusing, start to finish, and just feels good for being that.

That was phased out in the German dubbing; apparently this was still a no-no twenty years ago. Thank God this has changed in the meantime.

","'Top Secret' is one of the comedies from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker. During the years they have brought the wonderful 'Airplane!', the very funny 'Naked Gun'-series, two 'Hot Shots!'-movies, 'Jane Austen's Mafia!' and 'Rat Race'. This movie belongs in that list of very funny movies. It is not as good as 'Airplane!' or the first 'Naked Gun' but it comes close.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer is Nick Rivers, an American rock n' roll singer, who comes to East-Germany. To tell you the truth I can't remember really why he did that, but of course that doesn't matter very much. In East-Germany he meets Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge). Her father is imprisoned by the East-German regime and Nick wants to help Hillary to find him back. The movie is not really about the plot but to tell more would reveal some very funny surprises.<br/><br/>A lot of movie references will pas during the movie, the most obvious are probably from 'The Blue Lagoon' and all the Elvis Presley musicals. It is a little hard to explain the movie but consider a scene where Nick and Lucy want to hide. They pass a closet that says ""Janitor"", you see them in almost every building. They open the closet and behind the door we see the actual janitor in a very small space. They close the door and enter a room that says ""props"". In the room we see actual props.

Early in the movie, when Nick and Hillary are dancing, Hillary says, ""My grandfather used to live in America. He escaped in a balloon during the Jimmy Carter administration."" The audience laughed, and Zucker turned to the person he was with, and said, ""See! I told you that was funny!"" After the movie, ZAZ did a question-and-answer period. They said that, after the success of ""Airplane!"", Paramount wanted them to do a sequel. ""No, we've done all the funny airplane jokes; we want to do something else."" And, so, Paramount went and did ""Airplane 2"" without them. For their next project, they had debated whether to spoof WWII movies, spy movies, or Elvis movies...and decided to do all three at once, which is how ""Top Secret!"" came to be."

"Java_Joe","8","1","1","3 June 2019"," Spoof movie done right.
","There was a time when spoof movies were funny. They relied on visual gags. They relied on jokes. They relied on ridiculous situations, funny characters and subverting expectations. In short, they relied on comedy to sell the product. Then filmmakers got lazy. Really lazy. Instead of carefully crafting a joke or scene they went for pop culture references that immediately date the movie and make it unwatchable a few years later. But during the 80's we had a series of gems of the genre and this is possibly one of the funniest.<br/><br/>The story, if you can call it such, deals with a young man played by Val Kilmer who's the biggest rock star of his time. His big hit, ""Skeet Surfing"" where people take to the waves on their surfboards and try to hit their targets while wielding shotguns. Silly? Of course. That's what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>His adventures take him to Europe where he fights against the East Germans, falls in love and Pac Man shows up in one scene for no readily explained reason. The jokes and sight gags come at you very fast sometimes in the foreground, often times in the background and everywhere else. One example is he goes to a fancy restaurant for dinner but they won't let him in without a jacket. So instead of pulling some musty old jacket out of the closet, they bring in a tailor to make him a tuxedo which is ready in five minutes so he can have dinner. Some of the jokes land, some don't but they're all played straight and no attention it called to them. It's as if nothing is out of the ordinary which makes it much funnier.<br/><br/>This movie is in the style of classics such as Airplane, not whatever Selzter and Friedberg monstrosity has come out this year. It's funny. You should give it a watch."
"snorlax3111984","8","1","1","12 April 2017"," Pros And Cons of Top Secret
","Pros 1. I was amused to hear Leonard Bernstein referenced since he composed the score for Ghostbusters, a film that stole a lot of business from Top Secret. Speaking of musical references, there's a funny moment when main character Nick Rivers gets top billing ahead of Stevie Wonder and Frank Sinatra. Sinatra would appear in theaters the following week in ""Cannonball Run II"" and Stevie Wonder would win an Oscar for a song from ""Woman In Red"" released later that summer.<br/><br/>2. I was delighted to see Maurice Jarre composed the score for this film the same year he earned a Best Original Score Oscar for Sir David Lean's ""A Passage To India"". Speaking of Sir David Lean, Omar Sharif gets to show a great comedic side he didn't get to show in ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" or ""Dr. Zhivago"".<br/><br/>3. I'm a big Beach Boys fan and I get a real kick out of Nick River's hit ""Skeet Surfing"".<br/><br/>4. I'm always thankful to get a dose of the awesomeness that is Michael Gouge. It's amusing that Lucy Gutteridge played Gouge's daughter as they both appeared that year in the Christmas Carol film that aired on CBS. Gouge played a charity worker and Gutteridge was the girl that rejects Ebenezer in the ""Ghost Of Christmas Past"" sequence.<br/><br/>5. Peter Cushing gets a funny scene as a Swedish Book Store Owner. At least he doesn't sexually assault anybody like in ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"". The villain in Top Secret is sexually assaulted by a bull but that's all right.<br/><br/>6. Not growing up in the 80's, I didn't know who Freddie Laker is. After doing some research, I do see the hilarity in Nigel naming Freddie Laker as a communist author.<br/><br/>7. I loved the Pac-Man cameo. This was just 7 months after the Hannah-Barbera Pac-Man cartoon ended.<br/><br/>8. I've had many nightmares about not studying for school. I appreciate Nick Rivers finding torture better than a nightmare about school.<br/><br/>9. The Wizard Of Oz is without doubt the most parodied film in history but that doesn't make this film's ""Wizard Of Oz"" parody any less funny. It's appropriate as Top Secret was released almost exactly a year before ""Return To Oz."" Like Top Secret being over-shadowed by ""Ghostbusters"", Return To Oz was over-shadowed by another Sci-Fi film: Cocoon.<br/><br/>10. Best Line German General: (on the phone) I see, well call if his condition changes (hangs up) he's dead<br/><br/>Cons 1. It seems bad timing for a code-name to be ""there are no good white basketball players"" when Top Secret was released 10 days after Larry Bird led the Celtics to their 2nd world championship in 4 years."

Nick then suddenly finds himself caught in this conflict and goes out of the way to help Hillary and the French Resistance free her father.<br/><br/>Well, I simply adore this broad and terribly ridiculous skit-riddled spoof by the comedy team Jerry & David Zucker and Jim Abraham. Nothing is safe (especially stereotypes), where the 50's Rock n Roll era (Elvis flicks); Espionage films and Hollywood Movies (such as Blue Lagoon and Wizard of Oz) hit mocksville. But while rock 'n' rolling with the Nazis, it also manages to poke fun at itself along the way, because really it's just one big joke with the little ones feeding off it. The lively premise is simply unhinged with a wild range of rapid-fire gags (the under-water saloon brawl being my favourite) and crazy musical segments, which are loosely tied to the thin central story. It doesn't wallow on about things, as there's always one joke after another, which mostly comes off and if not, it's quickly forgotten. Plus you got little diverting actions going on in the background behind the main dig, which can raise smirk. Amongst the many droll wisecracks in the script, are some smart jibs.<br/><br/>A very young looking Val Kilmer makes his big screen debut and passes with flying colours. His appealing persona is more then credible, as the rock heartthrob Nick Rivers (which clearly is a parody of Elvis Presley). Sharing the screen with him is the very lovely Lucy Gutteridge and a risible turn by Christopher Villiers. In enjoyably short roles are Michael Gough, Omar Shariff and the unforgettable Peter Cushing as a Swedish bookstore owner.<br/><br/>When watching it, I mightn't have been always laughing out loud, but at least this rollicking spoof manages to provoke a wry smile on my face."

","I first saw this movie on VHS in 1984 and thought, ""Wow"", ""This movie is what comedy and slap-stick movies are all about."" I rate it one of the best along with ""Shot in the Dark"". It was also the first time I took notice of Val Kilmer for the first time, then and wondered why he never continue to star in more comedies as he has the knack for that kind of venue. Instead, he accepts bete noire roles. He came close to near comedy in ""Comanche Moon"" which belies his talent for comedy.<br/><br/>The funniest scene from this movie I thought was when he was tortured by the GDR guards in prison until he became unconscious into the dream world of a nightmare depicting him missing his final exams at high school. When he awakens from that nightmare, he is smiling while he is still being whipped by the guards, saying to the effect, "" thank god that was only a dream"".

"JamesHitchcock","3","9","28","7 August 2010"," It all sounds like some bad movie. And it is.
","Spoof movies, which parody some existing film or genre, have a long history (several of the British ""Carry On"" series fall into this category), but they were particularly popular in the seventies and eighties, the period which saw some of Mel Brooks' finest work such as ""Blazing Saddles"" (which parodies the Western) and ""High Anxiety"" (the films of Alfred Hitchcock) as well as the likes of ""Naked Gun"" (cop thrillers), ""Airplane!"" (disaster movies) and ""The Big Bus"" (ditto).<br/><br/>""Top Secret!"" is another film of this type. It tells the story of Nick Rivers, an American rock star who travels to East Germany to perform at a cultural festival but while there becomes involved in espionage and in a plot by the East German regime to sink the entire NATO fleet. He meets the beautiful Hillary Flammond and helps her to rescue her father, a brilliant scientist being held by the regime and forced against his will to build the deadly mine which will be used in the attack. We are informed that the name Hillary is German for ""She Whose Bosoms Defy Gravity"", a piece of information of dubious veracity but one that seems appropriate to the striking Lucy Gutteridge. (Less so, perhaps, to America's current Secretary of State).<br/><br/>In their efforts Nick and Hillary have the assistance of the French Resistance. (You can tell they are French because of their accents and because they all have names like ""Déjà Vu"", ""Escargot"" and ""Chocolate Mousse""). Now anyone with even a token knowledge of history might ask what the French Resistance are doing in 1980s East Germany (a country apparently still ruled by the Nazis), but this is one of those films which are made both by and for those whose knowledge of European history, geography, culture and politics is somewhat less than token. (In other words for about 90% of the US market). I could fill my entire review with a list of goofs (about the only thing they get right is the distinctly unfeminine looks of the East German women's athletics squad), but there would be little point as the film-makers are clearly not aiming for an accurate portrayal of life in the German Democratic Republic, any more than Mel Brooks intended ""Blazing Saddles"" to be a true-to-life picture of the Old West. Spoof movies are not generally the place to go if you are looking for factual accuracy.<br/><br/>Spoof movies are, however, normally regarded as one of the places to go to if you are looking for laughs, and this is unfortunately a department in which ""Top Secret"" is sadly lacking. It is a parody that never knows what it is supposed to be parodying. It starts off as an obvious parody of spy films, both of the James Bond type as well as of more serious offerings such as ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", but with the introduction of the Resistance it turns into a spoof of war films, especially those set in Nazi-occupied Europe. (There are obvious references to ""Casablanca"" and the motorcycle scene from ""The Great Escape""). The fact that Nick is a rock star also allows the film-makers to aim at Elvis films and sixties beach movies (surely a rather outdated target by 1984). Bizarrely, at one point it even turns into a satire on the Brooke Shields version of ""The Blue Lagoon"", a film so bad as to be beyond parody, and ends with a blatant reference to ""The Wizard of Oz"".<br/><br/>One of the faults of ""The Big Bus"" was its scattergun approach, aiming at too many targets and missing most of them, but ""Top Secret"" is even worse; it aims at even more targets and misses all of them. There are some occasionally funny visual gags, but most of the jokes are either feeble, corny or tasteless. (Man being raped by a bull, Nick's manager and his ""anal intruder""). To describe the plot as ""nonsense"" would be to credit it with more coherence than it actually possesses.<br/><br/>There is one memorable line. At one point, after recounting her highly improbable life history to Nick, Hillary says, ""It all sounds like some bad movie"". You said it, girl, you said it. I couldn't have put it better myself. 3/10"

","Lots of fun in this shambling parody of a dozen different genres, mainly those in which the good espionage agent is sent into enemy territory to rescue an imprisoned scientist, climb fortress walls, outwit the Gestapo, uncover a spy in the midst of the resistance movement, slaughter innumerable Germans, make love to a beautiful woman, and do Elvis impressions.<br/><br/>Some of the gags are pretty inventive. A giant telephone looms in the foreground of the shot and when it rings a man in the distance marches up to it and picks up -- a giant phone. A man falls off the wall of a fortress and does one of those carefully times head-over-heel flips that stunt people have perfected and when he hits the ground, he shatters because the figure is made of pottery.<br/><br/>Others come across as rather too extended. At least a minute is given over to a scene in a bookshop -- one take -- that's filmed backwards and has the dialog backwards as well. It's funny, but it must have taken a long time to get the whole thing right. Every backward movement must be timed perfectly. Eons, geological epochs must have come and gone during rehearsals. Dynasties rose and fell. And the novelty is worn off as soon as we get the joke, which is about ten seconds into the skit.<br/><br/>And one Elvis number would have been enough for me, but I had to sit through three -- I think. Maybe it was four.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer is very pretty but acts as if he can't act. Later, when he was over the top of that cinematic arc, he turned in a splendid performance in ""Heat."" He does, however, capture Elvis's kinesics very well. Not that they're at all suggestive. No, no. As The King himself put it, ""I don't make no dirty body movements."" Best male performance in a slightly-better-than-average comedy: Jeremy Kemp as the German General Streck. He's absolutely marvelous with that pocked face and thick neck and built-in sneer. His German accent is convincing too.<br/><br/>The object of the parody gets a little mixed up at times. The East Germans are all dressed like Nazis from World War II. And they act and speak accordingly. But of course East Germany at the time was under the domination of the Soviet Union and was dying from an excess of communism. Still, the Germans are always good when you need a villain. It seems that we've never been able to forgive them."

","A great spoof roughly following the plot of the 1944 classic ""The Conspirators"" starring Hedy Lamarr. Some scenes are copied directly and others have hilarious extras thrown in, but most are pure genius created by masterminds of comedy. Val Kilmer plays an all-too-sexy parody of the likes of Elvis Presly and the Beach Boys while narrowly escaping Nazis and fighting for freedom. This film may not be as good as some others of Abrahams', such as Airplane! or Hot Shots!, but like them, it is guaranteed to leave you on the floor struggling to breathe as laughter consumes your body.

It's perfect.<br/><br/>He plays Nick Rivers, whose hit song ""Skeet Surfin'"" takes him to East Germany, which is still Nazi Germany despite the Cold War taking place.

Sloan's General Motors furnishing the Fuhrer with the Blitz trucks used in the Blitzkrieg, as Edwin Black has written about. Today, you have Google and other American tech giants helping China perfect its Social Credit Score and facial recognition systems to make its surveillance state all the more oppressive, while meanwhile, American retirement fund money is finding its way into investments in the same Chinese companies manufacturing the ICBM's that China is pointing at American cities. (Go read the October 2019 issue of Hillsdale College's Imprimis entitled ""Why and How the U.S. Should Stop Financing China's Bad Actors"".) Why not take the same kind of jabs at Silicon Valley tech giants the same way ZAZ did with Ford with the exploding Pinto gag in the film?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the Middle East, you have reports coming out about how the government misled the American public about the failed 18-year Afghanistan War campaign on the same scope and level they did with Vietnam while Big Oil grew richer and richer by the day. (Go read ""The Afghanistan papers: a secret history of the war"" published by the Washington Post.) that commenced, of course, after 9/11 (which 3,000 professionals over at Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth have staked their professional reputations on asserting that the WTC collapse was a controlled demolition using remotely-activated explosive charges planted inside the buildings) which was ostensibly masterminded in a cave in Afghanistan by fromer CIA director and president George H.W. Bush's old 1970's ""Arbusto Energy"" business partner, Salem bin Laden's half-brother, Osama bin Laden.... Uh-huh.<br/><br/>Can you imagine if Abrahams and the Zucker brothers weren't hamstrung by political correctness and the fear of offending the Chinese and the Saudis (not to mention Silicon Valley and Wall Street) and felt as free to take the same jabs at those entities as they were with the East Germans?<br/><br/>As author Dorothy Sayers who translated ""The Inferno"" has pointed out, back in his day, Dante took a lot of heat (pun intended) for populating the various levels of hell with real-life celebrity characters in Italian public life and politics whose foibles and misdeeds were well-known in his day and, in the process, created a piece of satire that has stood the test of time for 7 centuries.<br/><br/>The foibles and misdeeds of the 21st-century New World Order similarly beg to satirized as unforgivingly by the Zucker bros. or somebody - perhaps with the same over-the-top absurdity - in as worthy a work of satire as East Germany was in this film. If you can't change the existing order of things, at least you can take a good jab at it. Humanity needs that - as both Dante and the Zucker bros. enduring satire has proven."

","Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker are a great team of comedy writers/directors and two parts of ""Airplane!"" are one of the best examples of parody movies ever. Their ""Police Squad!"" was highly underappreciated TV series at the time and got infamously cancelled too soon but they made up later with ""The Naked Gun"" trilogy. Then there were ""Hot Shots!"" both of which were as influential in the parody genre as ""Airplane!"" and right until the very day I consider this Charlie Sheen driven movies masterpieces. And only after going through all these movies multiple times I discovered ""Top secret!"" and if I had watched it back in childhood I would have loved it as much as any movie mentioned above. From my today's point of view it is a solid entry in their filmography, jokes are funny and hilarious that I laughed so hard out loud at times (especially the underwater sequence - that was unexpected, creative and witty), great songs and wonderfully nostalgic soundtrack performed by the lead actor Val Kilmer himself in the rock 'n' roll style - you can even find yourself singing along with the songs. But Val was also one of the reasons I didn't like this movie the way I liked the other ZAZ creations; Val lacks charisma of Leslie Nielsen, Charlie Sheen or Robert Hays - he was great at impersonating Elvis and his moves, at singing but his acting just couldn't get through to me. I know it sounds a bit silly but I also didn't quite like the script: there should always be a good enough story but the plotline of ""Top secret!"" is messy, non-structured and abrupt; by the end of the movie I didn't have the feeling like I watched a movie, only a couple of sketches sewed together. All in all it wasn't a waste of time and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but I won't watch it again."

","Of course, there are some problematic moments in 'Top Secret! (1984)'. This is almost, but not quite, inevitable when when looking back on a comedy from the 1980s. Here, the odd joke doesn't just fall flat, it gives off slightly uncomfortable vibes. Yet, this isn't an issue as persistent or as pertinent as you might expect and the picture is, on the whole, a generally good-humoured and frequently funny spoof of both the WWII spy genre and the Elvis movie. What's so sorely missed in 'parodies' of today is a plot because, no matter how basic it may be (whether this, in and of itself, is part of the satire or otherwise), a narrative means that the movie can be watched independently of the thing it mocks, rising to become a comedy picture in its own right that's essentially just as funny for those unaware of the thing it takes aim at (though it is, of course, all the more successful for those who are). It's just this that allows this piece to be a silly, somewhat low-rent but undeniably humourous satire that feels as though laughs are its top priority but a story is its second.

Jim Abrahams and The Zucker brothers do a great! job here with very good camera work, solid angles and keeping the film amusing and at a fast pace. The Acting is fun. Val Kilmer is surprisingly very funny and likable here, I usually really dislike him in films but he was great here, as this role suited him, and he seemed to be having a lot of fun, why can't he do more stuff like this?. Lucy Gutteridge is decent as the love interest and did what she had to adequately and had fun with it. Christopher Villiers is great fun as the villain I really liked him.

"tomgillespie2002","8","2","5","29 December 2012"," Possibly the last great spoof
","Although it can be argued that they are still being made, the 'spoof' movie really died a death in the 1990's. Recently, there have been tragedies such as Epic Movie (2007) and its various imitations, all of which were the cinematic equivalent of sticking your cock in a blender. They used to be the forte of comedic giants and legends such as Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and the Monty Python crew. David Zucker, Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams made perhaps the last great spoof in Top Secret!, a relentless parody of spy thrillers that seems unfairly forgotten in the wake of ZAZ's (Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker) more popular Airplane! (1980) and The Naked Gun (1988).<br/><br/>With East Gemany planning an attack during a cultural festival, they invite American rock 'n' roll singer Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) to perform as a distraction for the audiences. Rivers, a sort of Beach Boys meets Elvis Presley, soon gets embroiled in the French resistance movement when he meets the beautiful Hillary Flammond (Lucy Gutteridge) who is searching for her missing father Dr. Paul (Michael Gough). Along with a group of misfit revolutionaries with various French pun's for names, and Hillary's lost-love Nigel (Christopher Villiers), they must break into the high-security prison where Dr. Paul is being held. <br/><br/>Top Secret! is a film of such effortless hilarity, it's a wonder how and why the three directors behind it parted ways and made such drivel as Jane Austen's Mafia! (1998), Rat Race (2001) and Scary Movie 3 (2003), highlighting just how much they needed each other. It offers near to non-stop sight-gags that vary from the inspired (a train station pulling away from the train) to the downright ridiculous (a character gets crushed in a car then is seen later with his arms and legs sticking out of it, still alive), nearly all of which hit the mark. But there's also clever word play, and that lost art - embracing the stereotype. Would a film nowadays get away with calling it's only black character Chocolate Mousse? <br/><br/>There are literally too many funny scenes to mention, but the one that had me in stitches is the scene in which Nigel and Du Quois (Harry Diston) dress up as the rear and front of a cow, when a real cow comes to suck on its udders, much to the pleasure of Nigel. They stop, with Du Quois insisting they make haste, and Nigel replies ""you're always in such a bloody hurry!"". It's marvellously old-school, headed by a wonderful performance from Kilmer, who as well as getting plenty of belly laughs himself, also proves himself to be a bloody good dancer in the few performance scenes he has. But it is also a sad reminder of just how good this sub-genre used to be.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","I remember watching this film on some old cranky VHS somewhere in 1988- 1989, with some 'orrible Russian dubbing, but it was so hilarious, we split sides laughing and almost screaming with giggles. Young and handsome Val Kilmer seemed so cool and nonchalant there, that we all simply tried to imitate his gimmicks and we all dwelt on repeating some of the craziest and funniest routine of the movie. Years later, I finally watched this one in English. Yeah, much of fun is still there and cameo by Omar Shariff is excellent, but still, some of the older magic is gone. Some gags ran stale, some jokes look vapid, some routine seems banal and not good even for a parody spoof film. The ZAZ team did a fine job. Yeah, some films lose charm, some stay the test of time. This on is 50/50, as some of the jokes grew rotten. But still, it can be watched"
"wikipediacabal","8","1","2","11 January 2015"," Surreal, inspired silliness
","I can't believe I didn't see this terrific slapstick comedy decades ago. It holds up remarkably well. Since the story takes place in some alternate reality inspired by several different film genres, it still does not feel stale three decades later. Anyone from age ten and up would enjoy it today. <br/><br/>Reviewers who criticized the lack of logic are seriously missing the joke. This sort of joyful craziness is usually only found today in the worlds of sketch comedy and animation. The audience for this picture needs to stay loose and accept that the film is about being funny and nothing more--and it's hugely successful. <br/><br/>I appreciated the fact that gross-out jokes in the Farrelly brothers vein are kept to a minimum. There is some low humor but it doesn't dominate. Absurd sight gags and wordplay are the most common type of joke."
"GusF","Null","1","2","18 November 2014"," A laugh riot!
","Although I adore ""Airplane!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" films and the former is one of my top 20 films of all time, I had never even heard of this Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker film until last week when one of its cast members, the always wonderful Warren Clarke, sadly died. The film is a laugh riot from start to finish! In his first film, Val Kilmer is very entertaining and has seldom been more likable or appealing in any of his subsequent films. He leads a very strong cast of mostly British actors including Clarke, Peter Cushing (in his penultimate film role), Michael Gough (who later played Alfred to Kilmer's Batman), Omar Sharif, Jeremy Kemp, Lucy Gutteridge, Ian McNeice, John Sharp and Jim Carter, all of whom excel at their comedic roles played with a completely straight face. <br/><br/>The film is an hilarious parody of the films of Elvis Presley (whose ex-wife Priscilla later appeared in the ""Naked Gun"" films, funnily enough!), World War II films and Cold War films. My favourite joke in the film is Nigel and Du Quois dressed in a cow costume, which is played by a real cow with black spots painted on it! Outside of its parody elements, the plot is surprisingly good as well. I've seen plenty of straight dramas with more nonsensical plots!"
"OllieSuave-007","9","1","2","7 March 2014"," One gag after the other!
","This is a comedy-spoof from Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, featuring Val Kilmer in his film debut. It is an outrageously funny parody of World War II spy movies in which American rock singer Nick Rivers (Kilmer) visits East Germany to perform, but ended up getting caught in the middle of a communist German plot aimed at forcing scientist Dr. Paul Flammond (Michael Gough) in making ultimate super-weapon, the Polaris Mine. Rivers and Flammond's daughter Hillary (Lucy Gutteridge) join the French Resistance, whose members have the most clever and hilarious sounding names you've ever heard, to rescue the doctor and foil the plot.<br/><br/>At only 90 minutes long, this movie is stuffed with non-stop laughs and outrageous gags one after the other, from the Resistance members doing the tap dance right in the middle of a gun fight, to the underwater fight in a saloon between Nick and the main villain. From start to finish, this spoof that will send tears to your eyes and have you horse laughing from all the surprise gags, film and cultural parodies and funny dialog.<br/><br/>With all the jokes and comedy in abundance, you wouldn't want to treat this movie seriously. The characters, however, seem to treat their ""mission"" seriously, giving this movie a fast-paced plot, no unnecessary fillers, and a fun story nonetheless. Kilmer did a great job in his first motion picture acting performance, as well as the host of other actors, providing us a thoroughly entertaining movie with comedy that just flows naturally, for a spoof, rather than force, slapstick nonsensical stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, it's some of Abraham and the Zuckers' best work. It'll lift your spirits and keep you laughing all day.<br/><br/>Grade A"

","Top Secret! (1984, Dir. Jim Abrahams & David Zucker) <br/><br/>American rock star Nick Rivers teams up with the lovely Hillary Flammond to escape capture by the East German High Command.

A host of characters join them, including Déjà Vu and Chocolate Mousse.<br/><br/>'Top Secret' was released when the spoof movie genre was popular, especially with the released 'Naked Gun' and 'Airplane' series. Val Kilmer provides a wonderful performance as Nick Rivers and really shows in his film debut, what a star he will become. Unlike a lot of today's spoofs, the jokes are actually funny, and will get you laughing out loud. The supporting cast is fantastic too, with a lovely appearance by Peter Cushing.

","Satire/Parodies have totally gone downhill. Shakespeare made great comedy 400 years ago, Mark Twain made some hilarious comedy 150 years ago, Airplane! and Top Secret! Were hilarious films from the eighties... and what do we have nowadays? bland satires like ""Click"" or ""Date Movie"" <br/><br/>The best comedies i figure are:<br/><br/>1. Top Secret! (1984) 2. Airplane! (1979) 3. Thank You For Smoking (2006) 4. Napolean Dynamite (2004) 5. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2003)<br/><br/>Top Secret is the funniest movie i have seen because its a perfect blend of Social Satire, cleverness, stupidity, one-liners, Parody, and plot (or lack there of). i loved it."

","Here's a disclaimer: I'm going to talk about the movie now, and if you haven't seen it, then you won't know what the heck I'm talking about. But it's pretty hard to review a movie without mentioning anything specific. And so therefore I am checking the spoiler box.<br/><br/>Top Secret! is a hilarious movie that everyone should watch every day after school every day of the week during fourth or fifth grade.<br/><br/>There are two basic kinds of great scenes in this movie - whenever Val Kilmer dances (because he actually dances, up on tables, down the steps, in long takes), and during the scene in the Swedish bookshop where everything's backwards and waaay in the background there's a book about lesbian iron-smiths or something.<br/><br/>The only negative thing about this movie is that its humor is sometimes so wacky and scatterbrained that I lost the plot. Wait, what's going on now? Luckily, the plot is the least important part of this movie. It's almost more beside the point than Aeon Flux."

","Top Secret! (1984) was a funny parody of spy movies and World War II movies. The movie takes place in Eastern Europe. A lot of the humor in this movie is dated but it's still funny. Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an American Pop Star who's caught in a web of intrigue. Can Nick save his neck and the free world? Is this movie really that funny? Watch it and find out for yourself! Peter Cushing makes a cameo appearance speaking ""Swedish"" as well as film great Omar Shariff. Another funny film from Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker.<br/><br/>The humor is fast and so is the pace of the movie. Val Kilmer does his own singing and he's pretty funny in this movie. I have to recommend it."

","FIrst of all you have to be a fan of the Zucker/Abraham style of humor to enjoy this. In their world nothing makes sense and everything can become a gag. If you enjoyed the Naked GUn movies you should really like this! Coming off the success of Airplane!, this movie seems like it is undervalued. This is a shame because it is very entertaining and manages to keep moving. (And not become just a group of pointless gags) WIth movies like these, I like to mention the level of crudeness that appears.

Fantastic cameo role by Peter Cushing who also shows he can handle a comedic role, in one of his last movies, for those who enjoy comedy, some fun action, and a entertaining movie this is the one for you.<br/><br/>The scene in the jail with the tunnel, firing squad and concert are a hoot, Val singing songs from the Beach Boys & Elvis with adjusted lines, nearly stills the movie.<br/><br/>Omar Shariff is another with guest role shows he is no slouch in a comedic role.<br/><br/>When you watch the movie just sit down feet up and relax, and let the movie take you for a ride."

","The ""spoof"" movie has become a staple example of what is wrong with 'Holywood' per se. Written, produced and directed by the Zucker team, it is, regardless of intent, wonderfully funny: if one understands the references and is prepared to suspend belief.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer (at least in this role) is wonderful. One can see why he was chosen to portray ""The Lizard King"": Jim Morrison (Morisson - spelling?).<br/><br/>Regardless of the somewhat crass one-liners, Kilmer IS a 50s maybe 60s Beachboy clone.<br/><br/>The notion of clay-pigeon shooting combined with surfing: ""Skeet Surfing - USA"", really sets the mood for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>And so it goes.

In my opinion, they made the right choice.<br/><br/>Although ""Top Secret!"" wasn't a hit at the box office, it's developed into a cult classic. <br/><br/>This didn't look like it was an easy comedy to make. ZAZ were working without a net. Especially trying to combine two dissimilar genres (the WWII spy thriller & the silly, Elvis-like musical) into one funny comedy. Some of the one-liners, the pratfalls, the skits don't always work. But I've had so much fun watching the movie that I don't really care.<br/><br/>If I'm feeling low, ""Top Secret!"" is one comedy I usually rent. It's dumb fun."

","This is one of the earlier successful comedy movies by Zucker and Abrahams that later included the Naked Guns, Airplane! Hot Shots and the more recent Mafia. Surprisingly, it went by unnoticed and very few movie fans know about it today even though by many it is considered to be the funniest movie Zucker and Abrahams ever made. With Val Kilmer in the leading role in his first feature length movie and a set of stars that never made it big, Top Secret is sure to bring a lot of laughter to viewers of all ages. Not only it is sure to give you a great time laughing, but it is worth watching just because of those amazingly made scenes such as the underwater fighting or the one shot totally backwards. The creativity of the producer sees no end in Top Secret. Great movie, totally worth your time!"
"akela9","Null","1","2","2 September 2004"," Cult Classic...This is a great flick!
","I think you're being a bit rash, Agent 10. The fact that you think the funniest bit of the movie is a 'pooping pigeon' says a bit, I suppose. To forewarn readers, before you get too far into this, I have a very warped sense of humor. I'm one of 10 people on the entire planet that think 'The Jerk' (Steve Martin) is one of THE funniest movies (for it's sort) of all time. 'Top Secret' falls into the category of THAT type of movie. There are movies that are supposed to be the height of dumb, yet still manage to keep you giggling, if not laughing outright, throughout the entire presentation. Please do keep in mind, however dated, however overused some of the taglines might seem on the surface(Airplane gives a classic example of this 'Don't call me Shirley') the Zucker/Abrahams team were the FIRST TO USE these lines. They were the original idea men for this ilk of humor; authors of phrases, so overused that they have become a part of the American vernacular. Movies of this ilk are mindless entertainment, but unlike so much drivel released by Hollywood they hold a unique position...they are SUPPOSED to be mindless entertainment! 'Top Secret' is not an artsy film. It won't make you cry. It won't make you examine the cosmos or the meaning of life. It WILL, if you have a sense of humor, and an appreciation for the slightly surreal (Example: Nick and Hillary are looking out of an upper-story window down at the busy street bellow and everything's so far away and tiny. Suddenly, a normal sized white mouse runs through the street, over the tiny cars etc.) make you laugh, and forget the world outside for a couple of hours of giddy fun."
"mofoto22","Null","1","2","12 January 2004"," good times all around...I don't think this is a spoiler...but it might be considered that
","Top Secret! is one of those movies that is all about reading into the details.  Forget about the weak plot and cheesy jokes...that's what most comedies are all about.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie is something that people probably don't really pay attention to at all.  Near the beginning, the general is handed a letter.  The letterhead states: ""East Germany, better government through intimidation""....I think that's great.  The general then uses a premade rubber stamp that says, ""Find him and kill him""  as if this is a command that is used several times a day.<br/><br/>Come on, how cute was Val Kilmer in the 80's?....Top Secret! and Real Genius are two of my favorite movies. I'm a fan of ridiculous comedies, and this is one of the best."

This film provided many clips for the trailers for ""night time TV"" in the UK (the rest were mainly provided by Battlestar Galactica). I still want to know how many folk provided arms and legs for the desert island scene.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is classic rock 'n' roll and very singalongable - I just wish I knew where too buy it!<br/><br/>Although Val Kilmer is not my most favourite actor, I cannot fault his performance in this film - after all - ""it's just some bad B movie"". ;-)<br/><br/>Get some beers in, loads of chips and enjoy a light hearted, nothing to think about film.

He's sitting right over there.(cut to shot of midget waving to camera).<br/><br/>It's also smart enough to have an entire scene based on the premise that English, when played backward, sounds like Swedish(don't even ask).<br/><br/>It somehow manages to spoof Frankie and Annette, Elvis movies, ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Dirty Dozen,"" Westerns, ""Casablanca,"" spy movies,""The Blue Lagoon,"" and even ""The Wizard of Oz."" I have no idea how this movie was conceived, or what studio executive greenlighted this, but God bless everyone involved with this movie, because it is a sublime idiocy, and one of my all-time favorite comedies. If you loved ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun,"" and you've never seen this, you missed the best of the bunch."
"NicWester","Null","1","2","30 July 2002"," It's good.
","The one line summary says it all, really. There are funnier movies out there, such as the later Naked Gun and Airplane movies, but Top Secret is still good. If you don't like Airplane or Naked Gun or Hot Shots, then odds are you won't like Top Secret either.<br/><br/>Like the movies to which it is often compared, Top Secret is filled with a dozen jokes, gags and/or puns in nearly every frame. Even if you don't see them initially, I assure you that they are there, especially if you speak either German or Yiddish or if you've seen more spy movies, film noir, Elvis musicals, war movies or westerns than is healthy.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an American singer on his way to East Germany to perform at the government's request. This actually is the one flaw with the movie... Since he's a singer, that means... Val Kilmer sings... Argh. But, thanks to the wonders of DVD, I can now skip through that with barely a wince. From there he becomes involved in an East German plot to ressurect the third reich, and what would a movie with Nazis in it be without the resistance movement? Of course all the resistance fighters are French for some reason... But that's just the type of warped movie you're looking for. For a serious movie person, all the logical leaps and bounds will cause their heads to explode, but if you're that serious, you wouldn't watch this anyhow.<br/><br/>So I give this movie two ratings. On the one hand, there's the rating for the casual viewer who is just looking to laugh a bit-- There it's an 8/10, one point knocked off for each song break (except the first, which is actually good). But if you're looking for a serious movie with social commentary... 1/10. Frankly, though, if you're looking for that, why are you in the slapstick section of your video store?"
"hippiedj","10","1","2","21 July 2002"," ""NEEK!""
","Top Secret is undoubtedly one of THE funniest films ever made.  It is chock full of one-liners and sight gags that come fast and furious.  So much so, that I'm sure some viewers will miss things the first time around.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer is indeed underrated: the guy can act, sing, and dance!  You don't see many actors these days that are that well trained in the film industry.  How many of you were smart enough to buy the five-track vinyl EP of Val singing the songs from Top Secret all those years ago?  It's one of my most prized possessions.  When listening to Nick Rivers sing you too will scream ""NEEK!""<br/><br/>The spoofs of Elvis and spy movies are the main focus, but you'll be treated to plenty more references from The Wizard Of Oz to The Blue Lagoon, and everything is interwoven with brilliance. After all, in what universe or time did this East Germany exist? This concept for Top Secret is so bizarre and I think it just can't be topped. The cheesy pizzas at Der Pizza Haus had me laughing so hard I was crying.  Undoubtedly it would receive a PG-13 if released today, this film had a lot of great adult humor in it for a PG.  I was gasping and laughing so hard at the introduction of the Anal Intruder product -- as with that scene, everything was played so sincerely that you just couldn't believe what you were seeing.  Of course, the Swedish bookshop has to be considered one of the funniest, most clever, and complicated sequences in film history.  Frankly, I enjoy this film a lot more than Airplane (a classic too of course), as it touches on things that I relate to more.  Yes, I GOT the Pinto joke....our family owned one of those cars. Speaking of cars, seeing Omar Sharif crunched up in a car cube was astonishing!  There's so much attention to detail in EVERY frame of this film, down to even the choice of backing singers for Nick Rivers when he performs.  Simply amazing.<br/><br/>There's no need for me to go on and on about this film, as I'm sure many have read all there is to know about the plot and what people consider the funniest moments.  I primarily wanted to get my two cents worth in and say that Top Secret is a true classic, deserves a lot more respect, and maybe Paramount will some day put out a MORE special edition of the DVD than the one that's available now -- this is the one movie I have been waiting for on DVD more than any other besides the release of Eraserhead in 2002.<br/><br/>Top Secret is a real treat and will have you singing ""Skeet Surfin'"" for days!

Some of the jokes are a little inside, but I think that it makes them funnier (although less accessible). For instance, the scene in the diner where Val Kilmer sings is even funnier if you recall the analogous scene in ""Loving You"", which is a wonderful Elvis turkey (and I say this in the most affectionate way).

","I am probably suspicious to say anything about this film, since that i really dislike the parody genre, but frankly that one is awful even for that genre. Jesus. It's so dull and repetitive that almost walked out. I mean, obviously there was a gag or two that inevitably made me laugh, specifically the cows scene, but apart of that scene, the rest is garbage. The story is totally disjointed and confuse, even for a spoof film. Some of the references are not funny at all, and i am familiar with the WW2 'spy' sub-genre. Val Kilmer's debut couldn't be any worse. He tries to be funny, but his acting limitations were evident here. Being funny is not something easy, anyways. Omar Sharif was, despite his relatively short screen-time, in the most dumbest and ridiculous gags in the film. I didn't want to believe that the guy who played the protagonist so masterfully in Dr. Zhivago was in that dumb film.

Well, I didn't even manage that... There have been before and after much better movies in this sub-genre, Airplane! and Police Academy, to name just two. This one is a meaningless assembly of gags, most of which aren't even good. If you are looking for a good parody of WWII movies, then go and watch the TV series 'Allo, Allo' which was also filmed in the 80-ies. Now that is what I call a good parody, and it is hilarious!<br/><br/>All in all, Top Secret! is a waste of time.

","Well, I got enough of guessing if the humor in this movie is voluntary, or involuntary. Some may call it a parody, but the only parody is the claim of the authors that they know anything about film making. They certainly have no clue about geography, history, the difference between Communism and Fascism (East Germany was more anti-fascist than its Western counterpart, guys!) and less of all about cinema. The only humor may be related to some US TV comedy jokes, but this is mostly lost 18 years after the making of the movie, or was lost from the beginning for the non-US audiences.<br/><br/>
Skip this precursor of the parody about films genre when you meet it at the movie rentals. 4/10 on my personal scale."
"counterrevolutionary","4","3","15","7 September 2003"," Misfire
","It took me a while to figure out why this movie is so painfully boring, while very similar films such as AIRPLANE! and NAKED GUN are hilarious.<br/><br/>The whole point of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker brand of zany, off-the-wall humor is to confound audience expectations. This was easiest, of course, in AIRPLANE!, when most people went into the theater unfamiliar with Z-A-Z. However, even in the later NAKED GUN (and the POLICE SQUAD! TV series), when everyone knew what to expect, Z-A-Z set up certain expectations by making it a parody of cop shows and effectively establishing the ""cop show"" feel. The jokes naturally arise from the very familiar cop-show situations and turn those situations on their heads. In TOP SECRET!, by contrast, the idea seems to be to give the audience *precisely* what they are expecting--wacky jokes.<br/><br/>As a parody, the film fails utterly. Trying to ""do"" three different genres completely prevents them from establishing a specific genre feel which then leads naturally to the jokes. Instead, Z-A-Z just throw a bunch of jokes up on screen, because they know that's what the audience wants. And it simply doesn't work, because the jokes aren't *about* anything. It certainly doesn't help that they're also mostly unfunny and uninspired.<br/><br/>4/10."

"jzappa","7","1","3","26 October 2010"," Ah, I Don't Care Anymore. It's Just Hilarious, So Watch It.
","Here's a movie so abjectly campy and poorly made that enjoying it is like watching a performance while someone next to you obnoxiously chews gum the whole time. It is so obviously shot on studio sets. Actors are so obviously wearing make up. During the hilarious German magic salesman bit, whatever the German sprays in the spy's face makes the spy's make-up smear more and more. I can't quite figure out if Val Kilmer is just all-around wooden or if the Zuckers just don't tend to use his better takes. The musical sequences are truly boring, except for the rug sequence which is pretty cool. What it ends up boiling down to is an unending stream of puns and coarse visual gags one must wade through hopeless production values to take pleasure in.<br/><br/>Regardless, if one can, there is one sequence that's such a unique example of expressly cinematic humor that I'm surprised to find it here rather than an early Woody Allen comedy. The hero visits a Swedish bookshop. The scene relies not on why, but on English played in reverse, which sounds Scandinavian. The entire scene does this, with English subtitles. This is funny enough at the outset, before we even get it, but it becomes exceptional at the end of the scene, when it finally gives itself away. This is a level of filmic wit so far beyond comparison the surrounding movie that it's almost a contradiction splattered in the middle of it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, like a Mel Brooks film, this movie will readily go for a laugh wherever one is even distantly liable to be found. It has political jokes and boob jokes, dog poop gags, and ballet jokes. It teases two utterly divergent Hollywood genres: the spy thriller and the Elvis Presley musical. It concerns an expatriate who escaped America by balloon during the Carter administration, an associate of the French underground named Escargot, and Omar Sharif contained in a flattened automobile.<br/><br/>Unlike Airplane!, which devoted itself to sending up one, very easily identifiable kind of popular film and which was performed by a large cast of recognizables whose careers were secured by such films, Top Secret! is based on no directly familiar forebear. It's by and large a lampoon of East-West espionage movies, as they might have been fashioned to go with a star like Elvis Presley or Frankie Avalon, something that no East-West espionage film ever remotely came close to doing. But now that I think about a lot of the shameless WWII propaganda using A-list dramatic talent, why not go all the way and put Paul Anka and Fabian on the frontlines with the dirty Japs and crouts? The foreseeably threadbare story in Top Secret! has something to do with an East German plot to bring Germany back together, ostensibly by containing the United States fleet just inside the Strait of Gibraltar. There's also something about a secret weapon and, more important, a huge cultural festival in East Germany designed to distract the attention of the Western powers from events in the Mediterranean. This really is a funny idea, too. I mean, can you imagine the Joint Chiefs being so concerned with whether or not Leonard Bernstein shows at a cultural festival that they would neglect to look at their daily intelligence reports?"

Yes, it makes fun of Airport '77, but that is not enough to warrant the term ""parody"".  <br/><br/>Top Secret parodies many specific scenes from many different WWII movies but what I believe makes it the equal of 'Galaxy Quest' is that it parodies the 2nd unit shots, the cliches.  There is a shot of a german waving his arms telling a convoy to move forward, the shot zooms out and they are going in circles. the guy crawling on his stomach runs into a pair of boots and looks up to see..a pair of boots.  OK, a lot of people have seen the Great Escape and Steve McQueen jumping the fence on his motorcycle, but how many made the connection when Val Kilmer does it?<br/><br/>This is basically the WWII galaxy quest, instead of fans of sci fi shows and their filler / typical cliches that are obvious to people WHO CONSTANTLY WATCH THESE THINGS, this movie is for the WWII buffs."

","Top Secret seems to have little place in the Zuckers/Abraham/Zuckers team's career. It does not seem to be as successful as other films of theirs. In fact, it seems wedged right in between the extremely well respected Airplane! and its sequel and the Naked Gun series. Everyone has seen all five of those films, but only those who have caught it on Comedy Central seem to have seen Top Secret. I don't know why it occupies such a low tier. I believe that it is at least as funny as the classics Airplane! and The Naked Gun, if not a bit above them. There is one hilarious sequence after another with a few misses, but what are you going to do? All of these types of films hit and miss with their jokes, and Top Secret hits with about 90% of its jokes. Who could forget the Skeet Surfing song at the beginning? Who could forget the bull sequence? Or how about the ballet sequence? The underwater cowboy fight sequence? Oh, and, probably its most well remembered sequence, the backwards-Swedish sequence, a marvel in film history. I give Top Secret a 9/10, the same that I gave both Airplane! and The Naked Gun."

This movie has no action, no trace of it....<br/><br/>It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, well this is not - it' s very not funny indeed<br/><br/>The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.<br/><br/>Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for ""Airplane"", ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"", and the ""Naked Gun"" series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody!<br/><br/>I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the ""Hotel Gay Schluffen"", Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.<br/><br/>I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him finally!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If ""Top Secret!"" isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means ""She whose bosoms defy gravity""?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)"

Won't even bother detailing the messy plot. Really. Not funny. Maybe two or three jokes. That's it.<br/><br/>Charismatic as usual, Val Kilmer delivers some fun while his leading lady has some appeal but we never heard from her again, so who cares; Michael Gough is the coolest guy of the film playing a scientist while Peter Cushing, in one of his final roles, is outrageously reduced to a part that consists of speaking in another language pretending to be German and you don't have a clue of what's he saying (at least in the version I've watched, I don't know if there's something understandable about his character). <br/><br/>One of the main reasons I didn't enjoyed this is probably my current dislike in brainless movies that makes parodies on another movies. There's so much of them now, like Aaron Seltzer's flicks (I don't even bother in watch them, but every time I'm bombarded with more and more trailers of their upcoming projects), they're not funny anymore, and this one was quite sleepy, tedious, with few good parts (only the sexual jokes work). The ZAZ trio (Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker) at one time was the greatest team to make such movies and they were very good, being ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" their biggest comical efforts. ""Top Secret"" is a big disappointment that consists of giving objects random purposes, characters falling to pieces like a jar crashing on the floor and ruthless scenes that don't cause any kind of amuse on us.<br/><br/>And please, answer me this: in what year the story takes place? Everything looks so 1940's, Nazi German, but then there's this rock idol (Kilmer) who sings surf rock from the 1960's and there's devices and cultural references of the 1980's. It's so bloody confusing. Why bother, anyway? Endure for one hour and a half into a pile of wasted things is something to be treasured here and I don't suggest you to look for this.

","This round, (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker) and (David Zucker) made nothing but a bunch of jokes on the war movies, which didn't hold together as a whole movie. I wished that the parody's most famous team would present something more solid and effective than these desultory weak sketches. True that there was an ambitious intention, but the final outcome was purely deficient.<br/><br/>The plot line is thinner than a thread. Most of the gags are juvenile. There are some comic moments that manipulate the cinematic medium for just the manipulation (the bar fight under the water, the library scene played backwards), without at least real laughs along the way. Choosing (Val Kilmer) was a big hole to a ship with already many holes. He had such a stiff face, which didn't fit comedy (or in fact anything!). The supposedly comic lines were delivered miserably by him.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, if you noticed well, you would discover that the-stiff-face choice was kind of a habit of the (Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker) team. From (Val Kilmer) in (Top Secret! - 1984), to (Charlie Sheen) in (Hot Shots! - 1991) and (Hot Shots! Part Deux - 1993), ending with (Jay Mohr) in (Jane Austen's Mafia! - 1998). Maybe the studio used to demand a young handsome guy as a lead, whether had a talent for comedy or not! Sure (Leslie Nielson), a regular - and better - face in that team's movies, wasn't always satisfying for the producers as only handsome guy (young age beats talent is an old Hollywood story!).<br/><br/>2 things live from this movie: its actively ironic spirit out of the movies' exposed tricks, along with few marginal jokes. It's not a perfect movie in the first place; just a quick rehearsal for (Hot Shots 2) later. After parodying the 1940s and 1950s war movies in (Top..), they would parody the 1970s and 1980s war movies in (Hot..). Btw, character actor (Miguel Ferrer) was in the 2 movies, playing nearly the same role. The only difference was that the last one was funnier and more like a movie as well."

","There can be no doubt this is the stupidest movie ever made. It has plot holes all over the shop and the characters just don't make any sense, but if you're after a character-driven comedy that speaks to you on multiple levels, then you wouldn't be watching this in the first place. <br/><br/>This film is about one thing only, making you laugh! And it does it better than any other film in 20 years since its inception. There can be no argument that this is Val Kilmer's finest moment, because despite the high-profile roles he has starred in since, he has rarely revisited his comic roots. Only in the 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang does he once again display his talent for brilliant dry delivery, and spot-on comic timing. <br/><br/>Obviously, the plot is irrelevant, but it centres around an American singer caught up in a Plot from the Germans to, once again, take over the world. That really is all you need to know, because it's not important. The first time I watched this, I'd gotten home rather worse for wear, and flicked on the TV and some un-godly hour of the morning. Within 5 minutes I'd shouted at my mate to come and watch this crazy film, and the rest is history. None of my friends have still seen this film, but the two of us still fondly remember some of the fantastic gems that are contained within; the pacman scene upon arrival in Germany just blew our minds, the man chasing the tree still gets us every time, and as for Chocolate Mousse (Gasoline Ha Ha Ha!), well, if you haven't seen it, then it cannot be explained. <br/><br/>Suffice to say, I love this film. I love it for what it is, because it doesn't try and pretend that it's a great film, it knows that it's a stupid comedy,and is extremely proud of it. This film has more hilarious moments in the first 10 minutes than almost all modern-day comedies can boast in their entire repertoire! <br/><br/>To summarise, I'd say that everyone needs to see this film. Many will not find it funny, as it does appeal to a certain type of humour, but for those that get the first slapstick gag that they see, they are in for a treat! There are too many comic gems to list in this film, but I think I could pick out any 5 minutes of the feature and there would be something ingenious contained within. Just thinking about the hamster scene makes me chuckle!! It must be watched, it demands to be laughed at, and above all, it must certainly not be taken seriously!"

","Pound for pound, no comedy has made me laugh more than ""Top Secret!"". It's a satire by the Zucker Brothers (Airplane!) of both WWII flicks ( like the Great Escape) and Elvis Presley musicals. Think about the chronology for a minute.<br/><br/>	Satire for the most part isn't done very well these days (see the awful 'Not Another Teen Movie' if you don't believe me). The trap that many satires today fall into is that they simply recreate a scene but they do not let you onto what it as about the scene or movie that it deserves to be zinged.<br/><br/>	The Zucker Brothers know this. There's a satire early on of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" which starts with the familiar scene as we know it from Raiders but it soon goes into other areas before revealing itself as one of the more creative jokes in the movies. 	That's really a theme to this movie. The scene start familiar as we know them, but get stranger as they play on before revealing themselves at the end. This is evident with the fist fight in the truck, or the famous ""Swedish book store"" scene. The Zucker brothers seem to take scenes that one step further than what everybody else would (something the Farelly brothers have picked up on). They also fill the whole screen with jokes<br/><br/>	To comment on the acting is a exercise in futility (nobody goes to see Top Secret! for the acting) but here it goes: <br/><br/>	The actors play this perfectly for a satire. Throughout the movie they are deadpan serious (even when a long lost love is 'measuring you up'). The actor can't be in on the jokes (another thing you see in newer satires). The casting is dead on as well. Similar to Airplane!, character actors play the key roles. You have Omar Sharif as a much abused spy (""This isn't the Howard Johnsons""), Michael Gough as a kidnapped scientist (""But what about my tunnel""), and Peter Cushing as the aforementioned Swedish bookstore owner. All of them seem to have fun poking fun at their more serious images<br/><br/>	Top Secret is a satire up there with the 50's Warner Brothers, 70's Mel Brooks classics, and recent Farelly Brother romp- and don't let anybody tell you the joke before you watch"
