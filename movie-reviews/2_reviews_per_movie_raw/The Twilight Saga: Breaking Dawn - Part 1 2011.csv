","I'd say, stay for the first 15 minutes then come back for the last 20 minutes, just so that you can skip all of the nonsense in between. Surprisingly, the werewolves have taken a dire turn in this franchise which is a crying shame because their presence in the two other films were refreshing and light handed. In one of the worst scenes ever, they all confront each other through telepathy which is hard to watch because the voice acting is so out of place. The wedding scene was gratuitous and the birth scene was ripped out from the pages of hell. Bizzare."

","I know I'm late in reviewing this and probably no one is reading this review, but I had a hot date for this one and I couldn't say no. She really wanted to see this, and she had a thrill in dragging me along despite me not wanting to see this at all. I was never going to see this or any Twilight movie for that matter. She loved this one. I did not.<br/><br/>The problem, the biggest problem to me, is that it's very, very, very boring. NOTHING HAPPENS! Let's see, we see Jacob take off his shirt in the first two seconds of the movie and then Bella and Edward awkwardly have a wedding with fake smiles on their face. Then she has nightmares, possibly to show some form of entertainment throughout this boredom of a movie, and then there's the reception. That was the only scene I liked in the movie. At least it provided some humor. Then they go off to Rio... and nothing really happens. Yeah, they keep having sex and Bella just keeps wanting more. She calls her dad who is the only likable character, at least to me, in the whole series and then she finds out she's pregnant with some hell spawn, I guess. And vampires and werewolves get ticked off.<br/><br/>Then the dumbest moment happens. The wolves talking to each other. I swear it looked like a Saturday morning cartoon because they were so faked CGI and their voices was so Saturday morning cartoonish that Twi- hards should be offended! Anyway, the movie just drags and drags and I caught myself falling asleep. I held my date's hand and practically made out with it just to keep from falling asleep. I made it through the film. Thank God for that.<br/><br/>After the film, she really looked at me in hopes that I would love it like she did. I really couldn't lie to her and I hate telling her how much I couldn't stand the film. She explained the whole lore of the Twilight series and I still don't get it. I hate these movies. Unfortunately she is dragging me to part 2. At least I can spend more quality time with her."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","1","90","119","5 January 2012"," Breaking Dawn: I miss Buffy
","Let me start by saying that I would claim these movies to be in the best of cinema category if they just changed the genre from ""drama, romance, horror"" to ""comedy"". That's seriously all they need to do because the awful dialog is back, the horrendous story and the terrible characters are back. You know the funny thing is, the story actually has some extreme potential to be a great horror story with some in depth drama and dimensional characters with a powerful conflict. A vampire has sex with a human impregnating her with a child that will most likely kill her but she doesn't want to give the baby up so easily. But this is Twilight, where Bella Swan likes to play boys back and forth like a pin pon ball and the boys are chumps.<br/><br/>The newlyweds Bella Swan and Edward Cullen are finally together forever as they are wisked away to a private island where they make love for the first time, but everything is cut short when a series of betrayals and misfortunes threatens to destroy their world. Bella soon discovers she is pregnant, and during a nearly fatal childbirth, Edward finally fulfills her wish to become immortal. But the arrival of their remarkable daughter, Renesmee, sets in motion a perilous chain of events that pits the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi, the fearsome council of vampire leaders, setting the stage for an all-out battle. In the end of the movie, Bella, with her baby cut out of her and injected with vampire venom, finally wakes up from a coma. But will she turn into a vampire in time to raise a cute little CGI vampire baby? You'll have to wait another year to find out.<br/><br/>I swear on my life, Bella Swan would have made a great Shakespeare villain somewhere. This is the most selfish, manipulative, self righteous little (you know the B word that I cannot say on IMDb) ever in the history of books or cinema. She finally gets her wish, she's married Edward with the same ""enthused"" look that she always has with that dumb open mouth grin with bunny teeth and yet she's STILL flirting around with Jacob, sometimes in front of her husband! She's made every bad decision known to man, yet she still continues the same path where she wants to remain human for a few more nights because she doesn't want to hurt on her honeymoon, umm, you've been begging to be a vampire and picking at Edward every chance you get and when told that he could kill you she's like ""yeah, it's cool"". He hurts her with bruises and she's like the abused wife ""no, it's OK, I know he loves me"". Then she gets pregnant and everyone is begging her to get rid of the baby as it will kill her, she says with the same dumb grin and expression of monotone voice ""it's a miracle"". Oh, my God, how this is supposed to be the woman that these two guys are fighting over? She's so boring, so awful, not pretty, doesn't have any special talent, what is wrong with this world that they think she is worth fighting for?! All these immortals are risking their lives for this girl who is the blandest character you've ever seen.<br/><br/>Jacob comes into Edward's home, disrespects him and cuddles up to Bella and Edward is cool with it, almost encourages it. Taylor Lautner, I give him a little credit because during this one sick scene where Bella says she'd name the baby if it was a boy ""Edward Jacob"" and he has a look of disgust that I had too. Finally, someone almost stood up to Bella! I'm not crazy! They use full songs during the movie that are so random and out of place that it felt so awkward. The story is 30 minutes long into a 2 hour movie that isn't interesting and is an unintentional comedy. Billy Burke is the only actor who seems to give any kind of emotion to his role and I think he's just playing it like he's expressing in real life that he's just sick of this franchise. I give the movie credit for making me laugh hysterically, I needed a good laugh and Breaking Dawn definitely gave that to me. No matter which director they get, this series is doomed and tame. They are milking it for every penny by splitting a book that was written by a 5 year old into a 2 part movie that is drawn out with no suspense or interesting moments. I don't know why women(I'm a woman by the way) love this franchise, it's insulting and absolutely horrible. I have to cut the comment off but just trust me, I could go on about how bad this movie is but we'll sum it up by saying: skip it.<br/><br/>1/10"
"happinesswhatever","1","97","134","3 December 2011"," A brilliant example of wooden acting and bad movie making
","It is a sad world in which such talentless display of acting, screenplay and direction gets any recognition whatsoever. <br/><br/>You do not care about any of the characters, nor is there any chemistry between the supposed lovers Bella and Edward, calling it wooden would be a compliment,instead it is a bored and effortless ""going through the motions and I could not care less performance..."" Exhibiting with that a huge disrespect for their audience...!<br/><br/>Edward is suppose to be this strong and wise immortal, but instead I see a stupid weakling who faced with any sort of danger at all would appear to rather lay down crying than to stand up for himself..., there is truly no strength of body or soul in him at all, at times it seems he'd rather be Bella... and as for Bella(KStew), it is sad to see how one merchandise has ruined the blossoming of a good actress... it almost appears the Twilight saga has sucked the soul out of her... perhaps she'll recover, perhaps she won't. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the books very much, to my shame. However, this latest instalment has finally managed to kill all my imagined magic this Sage might have once held for me. I finally grew up..."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","215","312","16 November 2011"," Breaking dawn, beds and bones...
","Bill Condon has achieved the seemingly impossible task of filming that which had been deemed 'unfilmable'. <br/><br/>The book ending for Eclipse (with Jacob running away after receiving the invite to Bella & Edward's wedding), which was left out of the Eclipse film, is where we begin this movie. Breaking Dawn Part 1 thankfully takes its time with (most of) the important moments from the book. The preparation for the wedding, the wedding itself (most intricate back of a wedding dress EVER), the honeymoon (complete with leg-shaving!), and everything involving the pregnancy - these sections of the film are the most focused upon. That said, there are some things left out that may upset some fans. Jacob's section of the book? Condensed. Considerably. Hope you weren't expecting to see the stuff involving him going off to look for somebody to imprint on. It's not here. Sadly, one of the parts I liked most about the book (the stuff with Jacob, Seth & Leah) has been vastly shortened. But at least the major points are there. Maybe we could of got more of them instead of that rather pointless fight scene between the Cullens and the wolves? <br/><br/>Regarding the sex scene and birthing scene, which everyone wants to know about: Well, Bella & Edward having bed-breakingly good sex *is* included, but you can sort of tell there have been cuts. The birthing scene fares a bit better. There is more blood in this scene (and a nightmare Bella has early in the film) than the whole of the three previous movies combined. I can see how this would have been trimmed down also, but I think they really did include as much as they possibly could given the rating (here's hoping for an unedited DVD release). It is definitely an intense emotion-charged scene. Clearly giving birth to half-human half-vampire offspring is no picnic. Dawn isn't the only thing breaking in this movie. There's also the breaking of Bella's bones, thanks to the spawn crushing her from the inside out. One thing the movie nails is making Bella look as sickly as possible. She's so skeletal it's disturbing.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is put through the wringer in this film. There's a vast array of feelings Bella has to tangle with. And, yes, she *does* smile, though the happy feelings don't last very long. Edward (or 'The Hair' as Jessica calls him) matches Bella in regards to the number of emotions she goes through. He has to carry all this guilt over the one he loves most, and it clearly takes a toll on him emotionally as much as the pregnancy does on Bella physically. Poor Jacob, meanwhile, isn't having any fun either. These three characters deal with so much throughout the film. Stewart, Pattinson and Lautner (with new stubble) all sell it.<br/><br/>Most characters get at least a brief moment to shine. Some Cullens who aren't Edward get a bit more dialogue than usual (Elizabeth Reaser as Esme is probably the most happy about this). I especially liked seeing some conflict between Alice and Rosalie in regards to Bella's child. The wolves have a few brief scenes here and there. I was thankful for more Seth and Leah in particular. And we finally get to hear what werewolf telepathy sounds like. It's definitely chaotic (which makes sense). Billy Burke and Sarah Clarke as Bella's parents get some great moments, both emotional and humorous. Even new characters like the Denali clan get some screen time. Keep an eye on that Irina (Maggie Grace, who manages to do a lot with a little amount of screen time), she'll be important in Part 2. Bella's friends maybe get a line each. Jessica (Anna Kendrick, who still steals every scene she's in) gets the most. She, along with various other characters, add humour. Given how heavy the storyline is in this film, the humor is a much-appreciated relief.<br/><br/>Things do get very dark post-honeymoon. And one must admire Condon for taking on this film and tackling such touchy subjects as: the fact Edward can't be with Bella completely (while she's still human) without causing bruises. Does he let Bella die giving birth to their spawn? Does Jacob remain loyal to his tribe or side with those he has hated for so long in order to protect Bella? And what of the all-important 'imprinting'? Thankfully, we get a look at what Renesmee will look like when she grows to adulthood (which will be when Jacob starts thinking of her in THAT way. So don't get your panties in a twist about it. If you paid attention, you will know how imprinting works and it won't seem as freaky as it initially sounds).<br/><br/>Condon should also be commended for his direction, as his choice of shots add so much to the film. We even get a look inside Bella to see how the venom changes her. The effects on display during her transformation are really something. I also liked that they included flashbacks to the previous films as we hear Bella's Lullaby play.<br/><br/>If you don't like anything to do with the Twilight franchise, then you're not going to change your opinion by this point. Haters will hate. But for those of us who appreciate it, this movie is a fine interpretation of the first half of the book. As well as the choices of music used, something else these films have always done right is remain true to the source material, including (most of) the important dialogue/moments from the books. Things end in a logical place and leave you anxiously awaiting Part 2. And if you stay for a little while after the end credits start, there's an extra scene involving the Volturi."

","If you're a big time fan of the books, you have probably hyped yourself up to a fevered expectation rendering you incapable of any objectivity. This film, of it's own merit, would have never made it to the theaters. In a word, it is very ""boring""... unless your hyped, it bites! (pun intended). Many of the scenes were obvious fillers with terrible dialogue. The acting was so-so from most of the lead performers, with the sole exception being Billy Burke (Charlie), who appears to be a very good actor. About half way through the film I kept looking at my watch hoping the 117 minutes would be over soon. <br/><br/>I am being forced at this point to continue writing when in fact I have nothing more to say about this boring sequel of a film called Breaking Dawn. According to the rules ones' review must be at least 10 lines minimum. So what you're reading right now is the completely unnecessary and unpleasantly annoying filler, mandated by IMDb."
"Beck55","1","84","123","21 November 2011"," WTF was that?
","(I never read the books so this comment is strictly directed to movie franchise)<br/><br/>WTF WAS THAT? Almost 2 hours of NOTHING. God Damn it!, that was sad. It was a F-U to the public and especially to the fans. They might as well have sold us a bucket of sh*t, so we can carry something home because I got nothing from this movie. Not a laugh nor a cry, not even a boner (Bella looks like sh*t).<br/><br/>Let's recap the series:<br/><br/>1 - The first movie was OK, it was new and different. I actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Then they started shooting sh*t into our eyes.<br/><br/>2 - The second movie was exactly the same as the first (plot wise) but with wolfs.<br/><br/>3 - The third had more action and featured the Volfucks and an ""army"" (really? The word that's used is army?) of 10 young vampires who died in about 2 min. after the fight started.<br/><br/>4 - Then came this piece of sh*t movie, the fourth, and its plot: (ATTENTION THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIE YET SKIP THE FOLLOWING LINE!!!) Edward and Bella get married and have a kid - F-U!.<br/><br/>I don't understand why the final part of the series had to be split in 2. This movie would've taken 30 min. (tops) of the Breaking Dawn complete movie.<br/><br/>They really took a massive dump on the fans. And yet, some of then appear here to defend the movie which we all know (fans and none-fans) it was absolute crap."
"Lyra-gp","Null","235","367","20 November 2011"," If you are not a twilight fan you are definitely not gonna like it
","To rate this movie I think I should split my opinion in two: The twilighter side and the neutral side. Read the part that better mirrors your attitude.<br/><br/>NEUTRAL: The movie has no cinematographic value at all. Just a lame, slow, in places disgusting report of how a vampire-human marriage could be in the first part, and a badly directed (with some very awkward moments) plot development in the second part. I could not help noticing the derisiveness of some scenes; e.g. the one in which the transformed Jacob addresses his other fellows (I thought the movie was turning into a joke at that very moment!) and the one in which Bella makes the bloodshake fall to the ground and kind of breaks her back. A praise goes to the actors: the acting is not bad, is not bad at all considering that, in my opinion, nothing better could have been done (Kristen Stewart's performance is not bad and I found very convincing the character of Jacob). Another criticize goes to the movie slowness; in fact, those who are not very fond of Ed and Bell's love story might probably find the fully detailed and slow part in which the two get married really annoying. Finally, I would rate this movie, in this case, with 4,5 out of 10.<br/><br/>TWILIGHTER: I do think very few fans will be disappointed by this installment. Let's be onest, I was almost crying during the scene of the wedding (and I'm a male!!!) mainly because of my affection for the series (I was platonically in love with the story when the first Twilight movie came out). That's the truth: this movie's been made just for those who have always followed and liked the Twilight saga. I don't expect anyone to suddenly turn up and say: I've never given a *** about this series but I've found the movie absolutely awesome! This movie is for us Twilighters all around the world. Because all those scenes have an emotional meaning only in case you are very fond of the series. In this case I can and want turn many blind eyes (may I say it? haha) in the name of my affection for the saga. I enjoyed the Ed and Bell's wedding night, all those particulars (they even play chess!) that made me feel good during the projection of this movie. In this case I would rate the movie with 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>That's all, according to my opinion. Thanks for reading."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","1","45","64","29 January 2012"," The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (2011)
","I hate Twilight a lot. But nobody can say I am unfair towards it. The third film was actually entertaining and less infuriating. Breaking Dawn Part 1, is different altogether. It is just a horrible product shoved out with no regard for its audience. Bella and Edward get married and go on honeymoon, this last for over an hour. She gets pregnant, which shouldn't be able to happen, and some potentially evil demon baby is sucking the life from her. The films biggest crime is that nothing happens for so long. This series has had a tendency to drag on and on. With New Moon seeming totally unnecessary. What happens here, is that we get one book split into two films. This film has about 30 minutes of material in it. Characters have the same conversations they've had a thousand times before, with nobody evolving. Bella and Edward feel the same way they've always felt, as does Jacob. The sex scene is embarrassingly juvenile, with a quick cut to something from a parody. The film doesn't let up in the absurdity department, as some animated wolves have a conversation with each other, but with mindless growling and dialog, it sounds terrible. What any other film would have shortened into a montage is played out to a variety of banal songs that all sound the same. Finally we get towards the end and the graphic, grotesque birth scene is barely shown at all. It leaves us with a finale in which a wolf ""imprints"" himself onto a newborn baby in a scene more disturbing than anything The Human Centipede could muster. If you like characters that whine about everything, actors that have no emotional range, and watching slideshows of other people's honeymoons, then you may enjoy this laughable effort."

","Victoria is dead, there is no longer any threat to Bella. So she and Edward get married, while on their honeymoon they do the dirty deed and oops, Bella gets pregnant. Vampire pregnant, which means the fetus is growing at 5 times the normal rate and is killing her from within. The wolf clan cannot have this, as it breaks their treaty somehow and they come to kill the baby. Now Jacob must team up with the people he hates, the Cullens, in order to protect Bella. <br/><br/>While this premise does sound interesting, it's a shame that the producers wanted to milk this poorly conceived franchise for every penny they can get. Instead of making one film, they split the story into two and Breaking Dawn Part 1 clearly suffers from over stuffing and filler. Nothing happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. We know they get married, we know they have sex and we know she gets pregnant. It takes way too long to get these plot points across. The wedding, the honeymoon and the pregnancy could have all happened in the first 30 minutes, but it's instead stretched to an obscene length. <br/><br/>Books have more room to breath. The world is created an the writer has hundreds of pages to tell their story. Films don't have this luxury, so when a film comes out based on a book, you need to chop out the stuff that's simply not needed or wouldn't translate well to the screen. Since the people behind this film want to make more money, they split the last film into two. WB did the same for Harry Potter, but I can forgive them because there is actual story to tell in that film, here there is nothing. She doesn't get pregnant until 50 minutes into the film. Which means we are stuck with boring characters either being jealous of what others have (Jacob) or two people having sex over and over (Edward/Bella). The amount of time that was dedicated to the honeymoon is insane. What should have been a ten minute sequence, at most, takes about 30 minutes of screen time. <br/><br/>Once Bella starts dying, the film tries to get into motion, but it's too late. When she goes into labor, that's when something finally interesting happens and the rest of the film makes for some of the most thrilling moments in the entire series. A standoff between the Cullens and the wolves is finally shown here, something that people have been waiting for since the first film. The tension between the two families finally explodes. This is exciting stuff, this is what people have been waiting for, but the film still suffers from bad CGI work when humans interact with the wolves. So the fight sequences, as exciting as they are, never really reach their full potential. <br/><br/>The final frame of the film is so obvious half way through that I actually chuckled to myself when it happened. I still can't shake the feeling that the conflict of the whole series finished with Eclipse and what we have left is an overstretched denouement. Am I excited for the next film? Not really. Half the job of Part 1 is to get you excited for the next, this film fails horribly at that. What's left to happen? An after the credits sequences is shown where we are given a glimpse of what to expect, but I'm too far drawn away from the conflict by that point. <br/><br/>Breaking Dawn is not the worst in the series, but clearly not the best. Had the film been one piece instead of two, then it would have been exciting. The simple fact that it drags on for so long is proof that splitting the film in two was a mistake, creatively. Financially, it's smart. Because young teenage girls will flock to anything, case in point -- this entire series."
"shervinv","1","44","63","25 November 2011"," worst move ever made?
","First I had to contemplate whether this rating would have a ""spoiler""... It was a tough decision, because that would imply that there's some sort of plot line that I may ruin inadvertently... rest assured, there isn't. I mean we knew Bella and Edward were getting married, and the previews showed there may be a baby in the works, and well, there you have it. But after sitting through this.... thing....for two hours, I thought that I simply MUST write a review. I haven't felt this motivated and energized to write a review in ages! I simply had to start typing as soon as I got home! My goal: to stop just one person from seeing this film. If I do, I will have done my good deed on this earth, and my work on this planet would be done. I know, it's such a minor thing, but hey, it's the little things that count.<br/><br/>The movie starts by a few excusable facial closeups as we see one actor after the next sigh, or smile, or look wistfully or longingly here and there, while the camera lingers on them 30 seconds too long; sometimes with a sarcastic smile which says ""I'm really sad inside, but I'm putting on a brave face for you"", or a mirthless smile that says: ""I'm thinking about a grilled cheese sandwich right now, but I'll just smile and look past you to give the impression that I'm really deeply moved by what you're saying"". Now and then the REALLY good actors get to throw in a little knowing crooked half smile to add some REAL gravity to the scene! I could only imagine what deep ironic thoughts they must have been projecting, but alas, it's one of those things that if you have to ask, you're just not cool enough to know. Well! Just when you think you've seen every possible mellow dramatic look and cheesy music combo possible... the director decides to do it again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and just when you thought it couldn't possibly happen again, it does! And then again, and again, and again, .... Oh, and once in a while the director gets in his helicopter and does a senseless nature flyover scene just to break things up a little, and to get a way from the set.<br/><br/>Since I had lots of time during the film to contemplate life, the universe, and everything while I listened to the cheesiest musical scores to ever accompany a film while actors sulked, and stomped, and pouted, glared, and tried to out-overact each other, I wondered, why would this director resort to this inanity? It then hit me! The entire plot could easily be filmed in 30 minutes, and he had a whole hour and a bit to fill! I then empathized with the director as I imagined his moment of panic... it must have been a spot of genius when he realized he could fill the rest of the film with meaningless nature shot after nature shot, and the above-mentioned ""let's throw in another drawn out look"" scenes. <br/><br/>At various points in the film I drifted, and started to fantasize that sudden weird things would happen to change up the deadening tempo to spice up the film: like Bella would trip over her wedding gown, or Edward and Jacob would profess their love for each other and leave Bella to quiver lip herself into oblivion on her own while nobody cared, but sadly nothing like this happened to save the day. <br/><br/>There was one saving grace, I must say. Even though the theatre was filled with teenage girls, about halfway through the film, one, then another, then another started to laugh out loud! Pretty soon those of us who weren't comatose or brain-dead, joined in. It was something akin to a Christmas miracle! It was just like it happened in Whoville when everyone started to sing together! We the brave, and the few, in our darkest hour, we came together in laughter, and through our laughter whispered to one another: ""it's OK, we're in this together, we can make it""! And we did. <br/><br/>When you get to the very end of the film, there's this nail-biter to end all nail-biters.... you'll go through five to ten minutes of nail biting dramatic mastery, there's changing camera angles, and zoom ins, and zoom outs, and music, and really really bad effects ... all inching towards the final finale and the answer you must know: will she live, or is she dead? Don't worry, I won't spoil it, the real spoiler is this: when you get there, you just... won't... care! <br/><br/>So you, standing there getting a last review in before deciding what to do with the evening... don't do it... you know who you are, just... don't... do it!"

","I am neither a Twilight fan or a Twilight detractor. This said, I am indifferent to the franchise. As far as the movies, I still think, coming from someone whose knowledge of the books only comes from my sister being a fan and me reading a chapter of one and putting it down, that the best is Eclipse(not saying much) and New Moon the worst. But that is not a consolation really. Breaking Dawn: Part 1 is not quite among the worst of the year and nowhere near among the worst ever, however it suffers from some major problems that I will get to later in the review. <br/><br/>So what was it that got me seeing Breaking Dawn: Part 1 in the first place? The answer was its director, Bill Condon. I am familiar with his previous films and find him a promising director and writer, finding his films well written, observed and acted. Gods and Monsters is amazing and one of my favourites, Kinsey was interesting and Dreamgirls elevated by the soundtrack and cast was quite decent. Did Condon do a good job directing? For me, I am not sure. I'd say of the four Twilight movies so far Breaking Dawn: Part 1 has the most cinematic feel to it, on the other hand there is not much here that made Condon's previous films so good and I'd go as far to say it is the film of his that engaged me the least.<br/><br/>Are there any redeeming qualities to this instalment? I think so actually. Although there are moments of sloppy editing, I did like the look of the film. At some points it was quite Gothic, and at others it had either an evergreen or autumnal feel to it. The scenery often does look stunning, the effects are okay I guess and the cinematography especially with the close-ups of the back of the wedding dress and the final shot is some of the best of the franchise in my opinion.I also liked Carter Burwell's score. I like Burwell a lot, his music has a hypnotic and quite hauntingly beautiful quality to it. For my tastes though some of the pop tunes are on the insipid side, however the score itself was pleasant with a lot of what I like about Burwell evident.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the sex scene. In all honesty I was expecting it to be of hilariously cheesy quality, but somehow Condon brought a little more subtlety than I was expecting. The last thirty minutes was perhaps the most exciting Breaking Dawn: Part 1 got, as some of does have purpose and intensity, which was something that the first half of the film did not have.There are also two good performances, Billy Burke and Michael Sheen, the latter being another point of interest. Burke as always is amusing with some of the better lines of the film(though is that saying much do you think?), while Sheen, ever the great actor, adopts a menace and magnetism as Aro without overdoing it too much. Ashley Greene is also quite good, if not great.<br/><br/>I have to say I still don't think much of the acting of the central trio. Kristen Stewart is much better than she is in New Moon, with much less of the moping and dead pauses, but some of her line delivery is still awkward and her facial expressions for my tastes are lifeless. It doesn't help though that Bella is a rather dull character.Robert Pattinson has more to do than he did in New Moon and is less hammy than in the first film(the looking into the camera moments brought moments of unintentional laughter when I first went to see Twilight when it came out). As a matter of fact this is perhaps his best performance of the series and he is certainly the best of the central trio, but like Stewart some of the line delivery could've been more inspired.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner on the other hand is getting worse and worse. He is hunky to be sure, but does that alone make you a good actor? Not to me. I will give credit and say he is better than he was in this year's Abduction, where both the film and performance were awful, but the more dramatic moments from him felt forced and overplayed, and throughout there was a very stilted nature about him. A lot of the problem is to do with the writing. The dialogue in the Twilight franchise never was particularly good, saying this though in terms of written quality this is Twilight at its most banal, its most clunky and its most cheesy. The characters are clichéd and underdeveloped too, and at the end of the day you don't care for anybody. Oh, and the talking wolves were poorly done and unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>The story is very bland and unengaging, not to mention thin structurally and in content. The whole of the first half reads little more than ponderous melodrama. Was the wedding lavish? Yes it was. But it was also plodding and over-extended. The second half fares better, still with the clunky dialogue, uneven acting and cheesy, underdeveloped plot points and characterisations, but as I said the last thirty minutes or so serves as the highlight of the film. But for me what killed the film was the pace. Mind you, I have seen movies with slow pacing, but they are often paced deliberately and with strong meanings, great acting and dialogue and identifiable characters. With little of that here, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 not only is dull and plodding but also uninteresting and without bite.<br/><br/>Overall, despite my admiration for Condon and Sheen, this didn't work. The ending is highly suggestive of a continuation, which I understand is happening. If so, I do hope it will be better than this. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"aaronjbong","3","233","384","19 November 2011"," Part 2? I Don't Think It's Necessary
","""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" is a slow movie that runs for a lengthy 110 minutes and is completely useless. Everything in the film is prolonged and many of the scenes are just additional scenes to fill up the vacant spaces. ""Twilight"" was great, ""New Moon"" was a downfall, ""Eclipse"" stood out with more action, and this one - it sucks! The beginning, as you may have seen in the trailers, Bella marries Edward. A lot of emotional moments and talking, this and that. Then they have a lot of kissing and hugging and kissing and hugging that if you combine all the kissing scenes in the movie, maybe it could last until an hour. Then they go have a honeymoon and then something happens.<br/><br/>They did IT and the impossible became possible. Bella became pregnant (as seen in the trailer) and then the baby is killing Bella, taking her nutrients and we see an unhealthy Bella for around 40 minutes.<br/><br/>Maybe the scene in the end was a little exciting as it was quite thrilling. There was some fighting, a small dose of fighting that maybe didn't even last up till 5 minutes. I won't tell you what happened in the end because that's an important element in the story. If I tell you that, I'll spoil the movie, if you even plan on watching it.<br/><br/>The other scenes are ridiculously useless. There's nothing to admire in the other scenes. Unlike ""Eclipse"", even though it's slow paced, there are a lot of things to see, to explore. ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"", I don't think so. Because the content here is so little, I don't even think a ""Part 2"" is needed. Harry Potter really needs because there are plenty of things to talk about and each of them is vital to the story. But here, kissing and hugging are not really necessary and just a waste of time.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie will as always appeal to die-hard fans of the series. Unlike Harry Potter which appeals to readers and non-readers, this movie apparently doesn't appeal to non-readers (except if you're a teenage girl who loves Robert Pattinson or Taylor Lautner, etc.). I've never been interested in reading the books as opposed to the Harry Potter series which I read and enjoyed. This series, each book is just the same. Edward and Bella. Someone interrupts. Nothing new. Harry Potter? There's Horcruxes. Half-Blood Prince. Order of the Phoenix. Many things that are fun to explore.<br/><br/>Overall, I only recommend this movie if you're a die-hard fan of the series. Plus, I don't really think ""Part 2"" is really needed. Based on the ending provided, ""Part 2"" is absolutely useless. It's slow-paced, its content is so little, its useless. Probably ""Part 2"" was to just get more money. I feel sorry for Harry Potter. Harry Potter had always been great in every movie. But this, they don't deserve this much money.<br/><br/>Prince AJB's Rating: 3 out of 10 Final Verdict: I don't even know why this movie earned $30.25 million in just midnight showings. Its completely terrible.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review on this movie. I do hope this review is useful for you.<br/><br/>Note: Someone sent me a message and told me that ""Part 2"" will have something in it and would be interesting. That was good news but I hope the content there is more than what's in this movie. Thank you for the message though."

","I've read the books; although they are sexist and were clearly written for the immature female reader, I still enjoyed them. It was just so easy and fun to re-live the first-crush-drama and all the hormonal feelings through Bella. This have said, the books still have some interesting details and plot twists that could satisfy even a more demanding reader.<br/><br/>And than came the movies...<br/><br/>First of all, I don't know why they had to make a movie (or even two!) for every book?! There just isn't enough material to do so. Hell, the whole story of the first part could be summed up in one sentence. The characters just aren't deep and real enough to carry the movie. They aren't supposed to be, they need to be interchangeable with any teenage movie viewer who fantasizes about some unreachable love story.<br/><br/>And the plot is just dragged on and on...<br/><br/>It's like the director has given up of making a good movie. What's the point anyway? The emo-teenage-girl the franchise is supposed to speak to will go to see the movie either way. It will earn money whether you put in the work or not.<br/><br/>And the last book was so film-able; I was already imagining the movie in my mind. It had enough action, enough new elements that weren't already shown in the past parts. But again, it was more important to milk the audience for just one more time, then to make a half-way decent movie.<br/><br/>I still like the story, and will go to see the second part, but I'm just disappointed; this movie is just a reminder of today's capitalist society with no interest than money and financial gain."

"thesar-2","1","34","50","30 January 2012"," The Top Twenty-Eight Things I Learned From Twilight 4a: Part 1
","1. And God said: ""Since AIDS didn't teach you, I bestow 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1' upon you."" <br/><br/>2. The cast's acting ability is equivalent to a possum under attack. <br/><br/>3. Shouting out ""You did THIS!"" to a man who recently impregnated his wife isn't just insultingit's obvious. <br/><br/>4. While playing chess, it is appropriate to gleefully proclaim: ""I win!"" like a five-year-old verses the oh-so-ancient ""checkmate."" <br/><br/>5. According to the morals of somewhat-writer Stephanie Meyer, it is acceptable to kill humans as long as you're in the healthy position of playing both judge and executioner. Long-live mormons. <br/><br/>6. If it was previously okay for someone over 100 to woo someone under 18-years-old, then I guess the same could be done for a teen to an 18-minute-old infant. <br/><br/>7. 'Twilight' contains as many vampires as the Republican Party contains Christians. <br/><br/>8. Within 3-seconds of the start time, Jacob rips off his shirt. Release the horny and lonely 50-year-old moms! <br/><br/>9. Werewolves tend to get sick at the sight of blood, apparently. <br/><br/>10. You know you have script problems when George Lucas, himself, has dialogue suggestions. <br/><br/>11. The original subtitle of 'Breaking Wind' was questionably rejected. <br/><br/>12. Soap Operas, left and right, are being cancelled and yet this has a theatrical release? My apologies, World. <br/><br/>13. Mercifully, to cut some costs on lighting, the moon is full in every night shot, despite the continuity of scenes. <br/><br/>14. If this is the Anti-Abortion-Advertisement it screams, I will pull the hanger myself. <br/><br/>15. More got accomplished in the 16 Republican debates than in two draining hours here. <br/><br/>16. I've heard the same bed that breaks in the movie during Edward and Bella's sex scene happens in the book. Big deal; I used to call that: Tuesday Night. <br/><br/>17. Worried your unborn child might become a demonic offspring? Turn to Yahoo on an Apple laptop for all your answers. <br/><br/>18. Who knew a pack of talking dogs could be this funny, outside of Pixar's 'Up'? <br/><br/>19. The Mayans calendar has been recalculated to narrow the end of days to 2/11/12. In a completely unrelated story, 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1' is being released on video that same day. <br/><br/>20. Wincing as hard as you can and uttering the line: ""Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am?"" isn't the most believable pose to convince someone they're good in bed. <br/><br/>21. Finally, a movie I can agree actors deserved a $30 million paycheck. Isn't that the going rate for a soul? <br/><br/>22. I believe in Guilty Pleasures. Although, to call 'Twilight' that, would only be half-right.<br/><br/>23. Some women are undeniably psychic when it comes to pregnancy. For example, Bella acts constipated for roughly 2 weeks prior to her actual conception. <br/><br/>24. I admit: I've never been to war. But, I can imagine watching this is what it's like seeing someone's arm getting blown off.<br/><br/>25. Howcananyonekeep a straight face with dialogue such as ""'Kind' is my middle name""? <br/><br/>26. Pitching a movie in Hollywood should always take longer than the writing of the screenplay. Right? <br/><br/>27. Breakfast of champions: Chicken, Peanut Butter and Vomit. I wonder if she's pregnant. <br/><br/>28. Failed attempt at positivity: It's not as bad I thought it would be. It's worse."

","Yes, it IS awful! The books are good, but this movie is a travesty of epic proportions! 4 people in front of me stood up and walked out of the movie. It was that bad. Yes, 50 minutes of wedding...very schlocky accompanied by sappy music. I actually timed the movie with a stop watch I was so bored. There is about 20 minutes of action and the rest is Bella pregnant and dying. The end. No, seriously. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. If it didn't have such a big budget and hype it would rank with one of the worst horror movies out there. The movie is plain stupid and cheesy and by far the worst of the series. The first two movies were nowhere near this awful!"
"djo_34","1","22","31","31 January 2012"," One of the worst movies ever made
","I watched the first movie in the saga because my wife loved the books. I must say, the acting was good, except for Stewart who is a cold fish. She looks confused or depressed. That is the scope of her acting abilities. The character development was good. The plot was good. And there was enough suspense, mystery and action to make the movie solid.<br/><br/>New Moon introduced the werewolves and Volturi, which added new mystery and suspense. But the Volturi were never heard from again.<br/><br/>In Eclipse, no werewolf makes an appearance until over an hour into the film. And you are already snoring within 40 minutes.<br/><br/>Finally, Breaking Dawn. In the first hour we see a wedding and honeymoon full of pathetic dialog, weak acting, and ZERO imagination. It was slower than a Lifetime production, with less romance, mystery, intrigue, suspense, and action. Stewart's character states it was the best night of her life, yet still not even a smile. She would be fantastic if casted as a corpse.<br/><br/>After watching Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the CG werewolves look like they were rendered in 1991. They look to be about 1200 pounds. They snarl and human voices are heard... but their bark is worst than their bite as no one dies or even gets injured. There movements and interaction with their environment look extremely fake.<br/><br/>The final 10 seconds of the film hold the only suspense or intrigue in the entire movie. These greedy bastards just want teens to pay for two movies when they could have rolled it into one. They could have started the movie with ""I Do"", shown a quick scene of Bella getting knocked up and getting morning sickness, then the 15 minute finale. This movie was simply a 20 minute prelude to Part Two stretched into 2 hours.<br/><br/>Get your neighbor to rent it, borrow it for 30 minutes and watch the last 15 minutes and you are ready for Part Two."

"kell_smurthwaite","1","15","20","3 December 2011"," These vampires really DO suck!
","Have now watched breaking Dawn Pt 1 and can honestly say it is the biggest heap of sh*te ever! If I had paid money to see it, I would be going postal on everyone who conspired to take my money from me. It was absolutely awful! I only watched this because a) I'm a completist when it comes to all things vampire and I've read all the books (below mediocre) and watched the previous films, and b) I figured it couldn't get any worse than the last one. I was wrong. The series started poorly and went downhill fast. There are SO many things wrong with it that it would be impossible to list them all, but a couple are that the CGI wolves are even worse than the ones they had in The Day After Tomorrow (and they were bloody awful!), and there were several instances where vamps had sunlight shining directly on them and there were absolutely no sparkles (but then, I think VAMPIRES SHOULDN'T SPARKLE anyway). I could wax lyrical on the poor performances and go into detail about just how badly the scene where the wolves were all talking telepathically sucked, but I'd just bore everyone.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this one is pretty nothing-y as well. And the music is pretty much constant. It reminded me of when I tried to watch Twin Peaks, but couldn't because the constantly-present music was so loud I could hardly make out what the characters were saying. In this instance, I COULD hear what was being said, but the music playing ALL THE TIME was still very annoying. Sometimes there's a lot to be said for background SILENCE or just natural sound instead of music. I honestly cannot recall a single moment in that film where there wasn't music playing - it drove me absolutely nuts! It possibly doesn't help that the other film I watched last night (The Ides of March) was nothing short of brilliant and, in my opinion, a definite contender for several Oscar nominations, so BDP1 suffered even more in comparison. At least my whole evening wasn't a complete bust! I would have happily paid twice for The Ides of March - it's THAT good!"
"freemantle_uk","4","7","8","4 January 2013"," Edward and Bella finally have sex
","No matter what I or any one else say, there will be a lot of people who have already made up their minds on whether they are going to The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 and the most positive or negative reviews will never change that. Opinions between Twi-hards and Twi-haters are extremely polarised, but it is my duty to give an honest opinion on the latest chapter of the saga.<br/><br/>It has finally happened. Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) have tied the knot and, despite some pre-wedding nerves, it seems like a success. The two lovers spend their honeymoon on a tropical island off the coast of Brazil and we get the moment we have all been waiting for: they finally have sex. But a shock is in store when Bella ends up pregnant (remember kids, always practise safe sex) and the human-vampire foetus is killing her from the inside. As the Cullens try to save Bella, the Quileute tribe set out to kill her and the child, believing it will be a threat and abomination. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) ends up being torn between his loyalty to the tribe, his hatred for Edward, and his love for Bella.<br/><br/>There is a new trend in Hollywood to split book adaptations into two parts. It made sense with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, because that was a long novel with a many elements that were interlinked and it needed to be told in two parts, but ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" was trying to stretch the material to fit the allocated time. There are numerous montages, such as the honeymoon, which could have easily been shortened to make a single, stronger movie. The film had very little plot too; it's basically about a complicated pregnancy that just happened to feature vampires and werewolves.<br/><br/>There is a melodramatic tone throughout, amplified by the music, whether it was the piano-heavy soft moments, the epic score (often played over non-epic moments), or the emo rock songs. A little melodrama is fine, but it goes on for most of the movie, and when there is little hook of a story, it just becomes a drag. Even people who are fans to the series will admit that dialogue has never been its strong suit. Bill Condon attempts to make the sex scene and honeymoon to be tender, but it came off more sappy and overbearing.<br/><br/>""Part 1's"" strength is that it is the best-acted of the series. Stewart certainly gives it a good go and Lautner gives what is a half-way decent performance. Pattinson was slumming it, but with some of the cheesy dialogue he has to say, even someone like Laurence Olivier would have struggled.<br/><br/>Condon does have a few moments of visual darkness, including the dream sequence in the beginning with its juxtaposition of bright white clothing and blood and Bella and Edward standing on top of a load of corpses. The birth scene was actually intense and gory. But these are counter-balanced with goofy moments, one of the most infamous being a psychic werewolf argument.<br/><br/>The whole wedding sequence and honeymoon plays like a young girl's fantasy, sort of idealistic. This is fine, but hardly dramatic and not likely to have wide appeal.<br/><br/>Previous ""Twilight"" movies have had some interesting side issues that could and should have been explored. This is not the case with ""Part 1."" There are no issues of a man resisting his urges and dark side, a young teen forced into being a vampire, an army of powerful new vampires being formed and the idea of there being a vampire council. There is nothing like that. The few themes there are include a look into Edward's past, a brief debate about abortion and the idea of imprinting, which is basically brainwashing. A better idea could be looking at somebody forcing someone else to love them. That would be a dark story.<br/><br/>""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" is the weakest movie in the series I have seen so far and I speak as someone who is neutral to the overall experience.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

He was supposed to ""shine"" in this part, honesty, didn't see that. And the part that he claims the Leadership, to be the Alpha..My God it was so Cheesy and cartoon like! The imprint, I liked it, but I was so simple! Didn't like also that the Pack attacked the Cullens, that doesn't happen! One last thing I hated, was Bellas burning. In the book, she hang on, thinking of all the people she love, but all we see in the movie is blood, cells and probably, the venom! If you haven't read the books, and you will see the burning scene, you can't understand what the heck is going on! <br/><br/>The point of splitting one book, in two movies, is that you can give the fans all that they anticipated. Yea, didn't happen for me. The stuff I actually like, have nothing to do with the awful writing of Melissa Rosenberg.

But then I thought about it, and realized it's just like going to McD or BK (or any places like this). You go there because you fancy a hamburger or cheeseburger, take your pick. While you're eating it, you think it's not bad, but afterwards you're wondering, what was it that I ate? What is that hamburger made of, and that cheese tasted like garbage... It's exactly the same with this film. You watch it because you fancy a nice, emotional, non-intellectual random film. Afterwards, you'll find yourself thinking: what the *** was this? The first hour mainly contained Stewart and Patterson making out, and making out, and making out even more! Not even at the wedding Stewart looked happy, nor at the honeymoon. I was disappointed by the cheekiness of the film, especially the first half. It was so bad! Seriously, take a bowl, you're going to puke. And not because of the amount of blood, because frankly it's hardly there. The second part,I admit was slightly better. Lautner was also disappointing to me, though, his acting doesn't come through to me. It just stays on the screen. The wolf part was actually quite cool, where Lautner would stand up for Stewart and her child, and when he could hear voices. But the vampires fighting with the wolves? Not so much, I found myself thinking: whatever. Seriously. Awkward when Patterson realized that Lautner had imprinted on his daughter. If I were a father, I'd freak out. Honestly, he fell in love with Stewart, who is his age, and then falls in love with her daughter? I wouldn't sound cool. At all. The best part was the transformation. How on the outside, she lookes dead, and the shots from her veins, where you see the venom spread, is very well done. Well done, Condon, I knew you had it in you. Please, show more of your incredible director skills in the next part. Frankly, you can do so much better than this."

","This movie should be renamed ""Breaking Wind"" .... because that is absolutely what it is ... NO substance, all stink. I don't think the English language has words adequate enough to express how much this movie SUCKS.<br/><br/>Sitting through this thing was excruciating. The plot revolves around one egocentric, selfish, immature, mentally-weak, childish, unmotivated and impudent female, surrounded by a family of weak-minded, sickeningly over-sensitive, maudlin vampires, and one stupid Indian that turns his back on his own to protect this waste-of-a-woman that has already cast him aside like yesterday's garbage. In addition to being stupid, he's one of the world's biggest suckers. What a loser.<br/><br/>So there's the plot. Yup .. that's it. The movie could have been over in about 3 minutes, and saved us the agony.<br/><br/>If there was any justice in this world, those friggin' Quileutes wolves would have killed both Bella and that demon-spawn, and we would be rid of them and this whole series. And they should have killed that puxxy-boy Jacob while they were at it .. and for that matter, that whole vampire clan, except for Ashley Greene ... she should be kept as a Quileute sex slave. And I never realized that vamps could be such weenies ... especially that Edward fool. If I do have to watch the next and hopefully last installment of this disastrous series, I hope the Volturi come in and kill the whole Cullen clan (except Ashley Greene), and that idiot-Indian.<br/><br/>What surprises me most about the entire ""Twilight"" franchise is the huge disparity in the respective ratings by males and females. I have never seen such a difference. And it begs the question: Is Bella the standard to which modern-day females aspire? Do females really think that the world should kowtow to such a woman JUST because she's a woman? <br/><br/>And do women think that this is a love story?<br/><br/>HELLO !!!! This is not a love story. It's simply a sad portrait of female self-aggrandizement.<br/><br/>Pitiful.....<br/><br/>Except for Ashley Greene"

","The vampire boy looks like a male prostitute and the werewolf boy looks like a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome. Yet these are the least shocking fantasies dwelling in the hearts of adolescent girls and women over 40.<br/><br/>This is the second Twilight movie I have seen, and as far as I can tell, the heroine, Bella, has made no attempt to find an academic, artistic or athletic passion, nor has she attempted any other type of pursuit of achievement or learning. She appears to be somewhat petulant and extremely selfish, playing the vampire boy and the werewolf boy off against each other, and the two romantic rivals are too damn stupid to realize this.<br/><br/>The vampires in these films are all frozen at approximately age 17 in physical appearance and emotional development. As far as I can tell, only one vampire has a job, yet somehow they have buttloads of money for trophy homes and private islands and private jets.<br/><br/>At age 17, Bella is willing to become permanently stunted herself at her own narcissistic stage of development, becoming a vampire for all eternity on the basis of the mystique and male prostitute sexiness of the vampire boy.<br/><br/>It's the height of romanticism in our culture to fantasize about 17 year girls who don't know any better irrevocably tying their fates to creepy immature older guys.<br/><br/>Vampires and werewolves fight huge battles to protect Bella from either bad vampires or bad werewolves. Bella takes no action to help defend herself...she is an object to be revered and protected.<br/><br/>Of course, this all culminates in Bella getting pregnant, because if the ideal of femininity is the elimination personal achievement and expression, than the crowning achievement of womanhood is to make babies...even if the baby is a bloodsucking demon spawn.<br/><br/>The traditional adolescant protagonist in films and movies undergoes a conflict or has an adventure and along the way gains wisdom and maturity that will help the character make their way in the adult world...'Juno' and 'Rushmore' typify this concept. None of that in Twilight, that's for sure. Bella will remain twisted and stunted, just as the American imagination has been twisted and stunted by economic deterioration and religious authoritarianism. <br/><br/>Besides being a major mind-rape for adolescents with any emotional vulnerabilities, parents should note that this film has a very graphic (and extremely bloody) c-section birth scene for Bella's Hellspawn bloodsucking demon vampire baby."

","For those not familiar with the rules of the Official Twilight drinking game they are as follows.<br/><br/>Take a shot/sip when... 1. Someone says the word vampire or wolf or any variation including ""newborns"". 2. Whenever someone sparkles. 3. When the father appears in police uniform. 4. Whenever someone is brooding. 5. Whenever an obnoxious hipster indie song is being played in the background. 6. Whenever someone doesn't have his shirt on. 7. Whenever someone gives an unrealistically generous gift, does a foolishly gallant act or otherwise bends the rules of common sense for Bella.<br/><br/>Drink the rest of the bottle when... 1. Someone unattractive or out of shape is on screen. 2. Something in a scene makes you feel anything other than sleepiness or the need to plant your face in your hands.<br/><br/>Thus I delved into the world of Breaking Dawn Part 1. In this film, Edward and Bella take the plunge so she can become a vampire like she's always wanted. Jacob pisses and moans, and Bella has unprotected sex while still human resulting in her mutant baby trying to eat its way out of her womb. You know, true love and all that good stuff.<br/><br/>My roommate, whose expertise on Twilight I value as much as one reasonably can, filled in some of the holes that went unexplained or glossed over in the flick. Why can't they just turn her into a vampire while pregnant? Because it would kill the baby. Why is the act of sex with a vampire while human potentially deadly? Because their skins as hard as diamonds and they're super strong. How can these vampires live for eons amassing enough money to afford a private island off the coast of Brazil without the IRS at least knowing about it? And for that matter why would vampires want a vacation home in sunny Rio anyway? Just shut up and watch the movie!<br/><br/>My roommate did bring up an interesting notion that was not explained in the movie nor, she believes, explained in the book. How can they even have sex? Vampires have no pulse so they have no blood actually coursing through their veins. It only stands to reason that Edward can't get his little Dracula to stand at attention. So Bella is waiting to be turned, just so she can have human carnal knowledge of a cold corpse with a flaccid iditarod. Perhaps if you're being turned into a bloodsucker while you're performing (its been known to happen in vampire movies) then you'd have a fully erect projectile for always and forever but that would be a very inconvenient case of rigamortis. You'd never be able to wear mesh shorts, birds would always want to perch on you and all your vampire friends would always call you Vlad the Impaler. But on the positive side you'd actually achieve every pubescent boy's deep seeded fantasy; you could use you're dingus as a weapon!<br/><br/>Of course its all fun and games until someone gets pregnant. That's why its important kids, to make and keep important commitments to your loved ones. In this case, commit to spending the rest of eternity with a manipulative Gothic horror monster before getting jiggy with it or else be forced to drink O- slurpees while your ribcage and spine breaks from the force of your bloodthirsty monster child. By the way, the baby's name is Renesmee a mix of Bella's mother's name and the punchline of a cruel practical joke. The newborn is also imprinted by Jacob which is a way for a werewolf to leave his marking that disappointingly doesn't involve rising his hind legs.<br/><br/>In the end, Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a vapid, stupid, glacierly paced movie with very little going for it other than the welcome sight of Bella withering away. So its a substantial improvement from the rest of the series. I actually look forward to the next and hopefully final chapter in the franchise. Maybe if I get liquored up before the premiere (or during), I would only remember the good parts, like the credits.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"claytonj87","1","16","22","16 December 2011"," Breaking Dawn - Part 1 Serves As A Mediocre Comedy
","Last night I went to go see The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. I should lay a few facts out on the table. First, I have read and own all of the books. Second, this is the first of the movies that I have not seen at midnight. Third, I waited until almost a month after its release because I could not get through that trailer without bursting out laughing and I did not want to be attacked by rabid Twihards. Fourth, I consumed half a pitcher of a Donnie Daiquiri at my local Cinebarre while viewing this film. Now that I have put that out in the open, onto the review.<br/><br/>The fourth installment of The Twilight Saga brings us to the event many avid fans have been waiting for, the wedding of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). The movie begins by showing us a sequence of people getting the waterproof invitation to aforementioned wedding, set to an unnecessarily sweeping score. Of course young Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) is not happy about this turn of events and morphs into a werewolf to deal with his troubles. They get married, finally have sex, and 13 days later it is discovered that Bella is pregnant with an aggressively kicking little... something That Bella insists on carrying despite the fact that it is killing her.<br/><br/>Visually this is the best of the franchise. Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) brings polish to the film that the others lack. There is a sense of balance and purpose to his shots. It t seems as if Condon was trying to make something out of very little. Other props go to the special effects used to show Bella's transformation from healthy 18 year-old to a literal corpse. There are moments where they show her bones looking as if they are trying to poke through her skin and her complexion looks more like that of a zombie than a human. That however, is where the positives end.<br/><br/>The script, written by Melissa Rosenberg, at times feels more like a pro-life argument than entertainment. While some characters acknowledge that whatever is growing inside of Bella is slowly draining her life and should not be carried to term, others insist that Bella should sacrifice anything for it. They even go so far as to correct anytime someone says fetus or thing, repeatedly saying that it is a baby. The first time it was not annoying, it merely clarified how the different characters viewed what was growing inside of Bella, but after the 5th time it felt a little redundant. Add into the mix some fight scenes that have so much CGI it is difficult to distinguish who is fighting who and it makes you miss the moments at the beginning where Bella seems to be terrified of getting married and the 10 minute sequence of her trying to entice her new husband to have sex with her.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie remains mediocre, which is a rise from where we began in Twilight. Stewart still does not know how to show emotion, unless it is complete discomfort, Pattinson still has a blank stare and slight grimace on his face at all times, even as his wife is dying, and Lautner is trying.<br/><br/>This movie tries to act like it is a lot more epic than it is so here is the warning: Despite what the music will have you to think nothing in this story is really epic, nothing in this story is good, nothing in this story is really compelling at this point. However, if you liked the previous installments go see it. Or if you want to get drunk and laugh your ass off for two hours."
"nicole4evaneva","1","16","22","26 November 2011"," Horror Films Are Less Misogynist Than This Nightmare
","I wasted a free pass on this? Ugh.<br/><br/>Grindhouse movies are more respectful to women than this franchise.<br/><br/>At least the first one was interesting in the way first crushes are interesting. And though a Lifetime movie has more to offer than Twilight, Breaking Dawn made the first of the franchise look like the Godfather in comparison. <br/><br/>In a nutshell: Bella and Edward get married; Bella and Edward go to Rio and then some island to have incredibly tepid, PG-13 sex; Bella is happy, but Edward is brooding because she's bruised; they play chess; Bella learns she's pregnant. Bella loses a comical amount of weight until she learns to drink blood. Jacob is sad; Jacob is angry; Jacob is sad again. Then we get to one of the most horrifying birth scenes in modern history. Bella almost dies, but is saved by Edward's<br/><br/>love venom. <br/><br/>To be fair, the movie had terrible source material. And if the director had made it interesting, the teens would have flipped out for deviating from the EPIC LOVE SAGA. But to make matters worse, no one in the cast can act... or if they can act, they're holding back so they don't overshadow Kristen's mumbling. (Except for the dad, he is very convincing as a concerned dad. Good job, dad.) <br/><br/>But the bad script and the bad acting and the graphic violence aren't even the problem. You can have all these things and still get a semi-entertaining movie. It's the pacing. There is NO REASON for this movie to be split in two, and the way the movie stalls and dawdles on a super anorexic/pregnant (CGI) Bella or (CGI) wolves talking to each other in a lumber yard is a waste of film and generally irritating. The book speeds up after she's changed and there's no reason why they couldn't have added 45 minutes so everyone can watch her sparkle and hunt and argue with the Volteri and have sparkle vampire baby-free sex so we can be done with this."
"marla-rawson","1","22","32","23 November 2011"," Good Lord Where Did This Atrocious Film Come From
","WTF was this piece of garbage? From the moment the movie opened with the standard ""Bella"" voice over of what is meant to be a meaningful quote to the ""bonus"" mid-credit Volturi scene, this move was absolutely horrendous.<br/><br/>First let me state that I have read all the books a couple of times and even the ""Edward"" point of view of Twilight. What can I say, remembering the first crush,unattainable romance of my teen years was hard to resist.<br/><br/>That being said, where in the hell did this movie adaptation of Breaking Dawn come from? Certainly not the Oscar-award-winning director Bill Condon whose work on Gods and Monsters and Kinsey was truly amazing. The man obviously either needed the money or lost his mind to create this drivel. Seriously, it must be embarrassing when even the stars of the movie are making snide comments (Pattinson) when they are making millions as well as 2.5% of the gross.<br/><br/>So, here are a few of my musings on the ridiculousness and one semi-decent parts of Breaking Dawn--Part I. <br/><br/>First, this is a wedding that Edward & Bella, not to mention the fans, have been waiting for for several years (in Edwards case nearly a century) and the most emotion either Pattinson or Stewart could muster was attempting not to laugh while reciting their vows. Thank god for Anna Kendrick's spot-on portrayal of Jessica and Kellan Lutz's much needed comic relief performance of Emmet and Rathbone's ridiculously over-dramatic Jasper. I have to say, he and Rathbone decided they were going to have a good time making this one, excuse me, two and that is just what they did.<br/><br/>Two, what was up with the honeymoon? I understand that it was PG-13 and meant for the tween and teen set but couldn't they have given the moms sneaking in at mid-day matinées or, for that matter, anyone who has read the book a little credit? Where in the hell was the sparkle motion? Even the Twilight haters know that Edward, not to mention every vampire in this series, sparkles in the sunlight--um that's why they went to the private island for their honeymoon. Also, what was so damn exciting about playing chess? I'm sure it was a metaphor for who was going to get their way in regards to sex--Bella wins when she says please--but come on, isn't about time we got over that and the red and white chess pieces and board in all the movies? <br/><br/>Three, for all that is holy, what were they thinking with the whole wolf telepathy craziness? The animation was ridiculous and the multiple voice over at the same time was driving me nuts. Oh, and what about the terrible acting of the chick that played Leah? <br/><br/>And last, but certainly not least, the decent part of the film, the CGI work that was done on Kristen Stewart to create the pregnant, emaciated and broken Bella. I wasn't a fan of the missing vampire sparkles, the animation on the baby, or turning of the body but I have to give the CGI dudes their props for Stewart. Oh, one more thing they did right was everyone's and I mean everyone's reaction to Bella's idiotic choice of Renesmee as a name for her daughter. <br/><br/>Overall, in my opinion, this movie is the worst of the bunch--and that is saying a lot considering I hated New Moon. Not only were the actors, with the exception of Billy Burke and in some scenes Stewart, just phoning it in for the $$$, some of them seemed to enjoy creating their horrible performances--you know who you and your hair are Pattinson.<br/><br/>If you MUST see this installment of the Twilight Saga I recommend either going to a matinée or cheap theater where you can keep your viewing of this atrociousness a well-kept secret."

"willcundallreview","4","4","4","27 March 2015"," Part 1 down, and not a good start
","Rating-4/10 <br/><br/>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 1 is the first part of the end of this massively popular franchise. The problem is this is just very poor and is among it's predecessors not good yet again, it tries hard this time there is no doubt but just too little happens in the plot to muster an interesting movie that none Twilight hardcore fans will enjoy. I felt it to be a real disappointment of a movie and here is why.<br/><br/>The romance which I quite like in the series is there, but way too much and the sweet element they have together is lost in the first half hour, too much darkness creeps in here. The truth is this left me with a sour taste as all and the happiness is drained out, with a nice and peaceful start you feel it may be happy and the love will become stronger than ever before, problem is it doesn't and although more the books fault than the movie, still just isn't nice to see four films into it.<br/><br/>The acting is as usual all the same, no one improves but to be fair no one gets worse, it just feels like Eclipse part 2. With the enhanced roles of the two members of the wolves Seth(Booboo Stewart) and Leah(Julia Jones) it just makes for even more awkward watching and they really don't bring any good acting in, just worse. What I will say is this a film that wants Taylor Lautner to step up and when he does, well he is pretty average as all but still credit to him for being a powerful performer.<br/><br/>I can't deny this has action at certain points and it is well done, if not cringe worthy at times but forget about it and the thrills are there anyway. I think this is missing a certain type of action and when you think a fight will happen it either doesn't at all or the scenes are so fast with the camera movements that you get lost quickly and finding who is who is impossible in such scenes.<br/><br/>I think with the newcomer director Bill Condon it feels different if not too depressing at times, but he still manages to firmly get it done and make the most out of some terrible things in the script. The main basis for this movie being very poor is to be honest the source material, I think it was written to work well with the end of the book so as a stand alone movie it is much worse than it could have been, and Melissa Rosenberg doesn't help with the adapting either.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the score if that can be considered a positive thing about this, Carter Burwell creates a loving score that works well in even the darkest moments and although uses bits and pieces from past films in the franchise, still brings in nice new pieces too. I was saying about the love before and the score does help at the beginning which is why I felt this may not be as bad as I thought it might be, but I was mistaken when it was over.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part 1 doesn't set up the second part well and if I were waiting a year for it, I wouldn't have high expectations at all, nevertheless I still feel the book is to blame for the mishap here, not the people behind the scenes, well except Stephanie Meyer of course. Wait until the end of the credits too here, little hint at what's to come in the final film in this mixed up series."
"eahutchison","Null","4","4","7 September 2012"," Disappointed
","Vampires and werewolves are not subjects that normally attract my attention, yet somehow The Twilight Saga series has sucked me in. As a romantic fantasy novel and now film series, Twilight has captivated its' young audience by twisting the fate of these not so average teens. Breaking Dawn- Part 1 is the latest of the film series and one that seemed to stray from what my self, and many other readers, imagined in the book.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn- Part 1 opened in theaters November 18th, 2011 and grossed over $705 million across the world. Stephanie Meyer, author of the novel series, also became an executive producer for the film series. Melissa Rosenberg continued on as screenwriter from the previous films, but the biggest change occurred by hiring a new director. Bill Condon directed Part 1 and has signed on to direct Part 2, which is coming out in November 2012. As one of the most popular teen series of our generation, Part 1 was an interesting visual of the novel. After finally giving in to the vampire fad in 2009, I quickly became a rapid fan of the series. Somehow the movies have continued to fall short of my expectations. Granted the first film seemed to be a test to see if the fans would accept a cinema version, the budget was low and the acting came cheap. As I read the books I had a tremendous amount of imagery racing through my mind about what the mysterious Edward looked like, how the insecure Bella acted and especially visualizing the intriguing Jacob. Without critiquing the acting of these characters, I will say I think casting did a terrific job on selecting the looks of the infamous roles. Special effects are always a challenge but I think this film does a good job of portraying the abstract plot line including speed, transformations, werewolves, flying, and more. Aside from the very basics of the movie, I struggled with the actual portrayal in comparison to the book.<br/><br/>I think the one thing that frustrates me the most is how they split the film into two movies for the sole benefit of making a bigger profit. I understand that breaking the novel in to halves makes it easier to depict all of the blood, sweat and tears, but the way Dawn ends just leaves the audience craving for more, even though they know how it ends. Another issue I had was the birth. Birthing scenes are never fun for anyone to watch, act or direct but this scene in Dawn was one for the records. It seemed to make the audience not only feel uncomfortable, but the views of Bella throughout were unnecessary and horrific. Lastly, the acting has always made me rigger. I can't put my foot down on whether it's the script that is cheesy or if it really is the actors. Whatever the issue may be, I wish the awkwardness of the actors themselves didn't interfere with the complexity of the plot. Young actors are hard to train, but some of these actors might be a better fit for the Disney channel.<br/><br/>For those who are already Twilight fans or for those who might become fans, I would recommend watching the films. Even though it may not be the fantasy world you imagined in your mind, actually getting to see a visual portrayal is entertaining non the less."

","Just when everyone thought the ""Twilight"" saga couldn't get any worse, this drivel introduces the ""imprinting"" thing between Jacob and the newborn baby Renesmee (what a stupid name, by the way): I mean, ""Twilight"" was dumb and ridiculous before, but the blatant romanticization of pedophilia from that scene makes one wonder what the hell is wrong with human race when a story including such kind of stuff is able to become a worldwide phenomenon. <br/><br/>While ""New Moon"" should have been enough warning for me to stay away from the awful franchise,I decided to give Bill Condon the benefit of the doubt (Come on, Gods and Monsters was good and Dreamgirls was a decent musical) but not even the best filmmaker would be able to save the dreadful mess the Twilight books are.<br/><br/>Anyway, imprinting(*shudder*) aside this movie was unspeakably boring, being filled with lots and lots of padding, without nothing relevant happening in most scenes. There wasn't any good reason of why the last part of the idiotic Twilight saga should have been split in two parts, considering that the first part was mostly irrelevant filler.<br/><br/>Other than that, ""Breaking Dawn: Part 1"" has all of the flaws of its predecessors such as wooden acting, a cheesy script, embarrassing stereotypes, corny scenes, sparkly metrosexual vampires and shirtless teen werewolves. The only redeeming factor was the soundtrack, which in my opinion is way too good to be included in a movie like this. <br/><br/>I'm done with the Twilight franchise. By this point, criticizing its stupidity and awfulness would be redundant, way too obvious. Even kid's cartoon's mocked it and I think it would be better to let the sparkly vampire fad buried in oblivion, the same fate that waits for the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" film adaptation.<br/><br/>0/10 (And I would rate it with a negative score if a could)"

Obviously a 32-year-old male isn't the target viewer for this film but I must admit that it was a major step up from the previous two installments. I might even go as far to say that this here was the best of the series in a bad way. I say that because I'm sure teenage girls will be weeping all over themselves through the first hour of this thing but, as an adult, I couldn't help but laugh at it. The first hour deals with the screen's most popular duo getting married and of course the girl losing her virginity. I know this is a big thing to Twi-hards and teenage girls but the execution here is just laughable and especially the moments leading up to the act. The entire thing is just directed so over-dramatic that I couldn't help but laugh. It also didn't help that the dialogue was just downright awful and at times embarrassing. With that said, these bad moments actually make the film rather entertaining. Both Pattinson and Stewart are pros at these characters by now and it's also clear that Lautner continues to work out and this must cause him to skip his acting classes. As usual the CGI is pretty bad but I guess this is to be expected. Still, I found the story to be rather compelling and the entire thing kept me entertained from start to finish. Yes it drags on too long but you have to admit there's some pretty weird stuff going on here and especially during the second half."
"thepsychocritic","1","12","16","25 November 2011"," An abortion ad which isn't sure which side to support.
","The Twilight saga is not the smartest thing that has happened to the universe, but for a moment I am going to cast all my past disdain aside. I am willing to forget that it has repeatedly raped vampires. I am willing to forget that it has no logical consistency whatsoever and I am also perfectly willing to forget that my girlfriend dumped me for not being 'sparkly as Edward in the sunlight.' With Breaking Dawn, like the title suggests, it is a fresh start - a new dawn. <br/><br/>That's a lie. Obviously. <br/><br/>First scene - Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and his muscles (Photoshop) storm out of the house in a fit of rage. They barely walks two steps when they decide that they don't like their shirt very much and Jacob removes it to reveal his perfectly sculpted, Greek-God-like body. He does that in the zarking rain, by the way, just because that makes a whole lot of sense. The move achieves the desired result - drool, drool, drool. Jacob and his muscles have an understandable reason for their apoplexy. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who is their crush, and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the glow-in-the-sun vampire, are finally getting wed. But our part-time werewolf isn't happy, no sir. <br/><br/>First thirty minutes and they are still getting wed in the most depressing public gathering I have seen. The camera meanders through Bella's face, to her feet, to the cape she's dragging behind her, to her face, to the back of her head, down her neck, down her back and back to her goddamn face again; all as she walks down the aisle with her father Charlie (Billy Burke). Everyone's happy, except Bella, who maintains a jizzed-in-my-pants expression on her face, and does pretty good job out of it. Jacob and his muscles make a ""surprise"" appearance to warn Bella against the dangers of vampire-intercourse and pregnancy, before Bella and Edward sneak off to Brazil to celebrate their honeymoon. <br/><br/>The honeymoon is the second most creepy thing that happens in the movie. Ensconced within a cozy hut, this is the place where Bella and Edward finally do it. The entire purpose of the series is accomplished here in one nasty night. That is why everyone was reading it, seeing it and going gaga about it. They wanted to know how the process of inter-specie human-vampire coitus feels. Why is it creepy? a) If you didn't read it correctly, I just said human-vampire coitus. Yes, a human having it with a vampire! Is that even legal? b) Bella is 18, Edward around a hundred. If you consider his other age, 17, he becomes a minor in half of the American states. c) They break the bed while doing it. What is he? A baby elephant? <br/><br/>And guess what happens then! Oh, you already know it! Bella gets pregnant! Surprise, surprise! How could Edward do this?! With his lifespan he still hasn't learnt the use of protection! What a dumbass! Jacob and his muscles warned her! What will happen now?! She will die! But, wait! Maybe she will shove a few contraceptives down her throat! Or maybe she'll abort the foetus! But she is Bella Swan, The Vanquisher of Death! She won't do any of those things! Because human-vampire intercourse often kills common sense! <br/><br/>The thing that single-handedly grabs the prize for being the most egregious thing about the film is the story. They made a hundred and seventeen minute-long movie on marriage, childbirth and the benefits of abortion. Are you kidding me? <br/><br/>The acting isn't world class, either. All the actors do is maintain one- pained, long-drawn expression on their faces - of anguish. The three lead characters, Lautner, Pattinson and their prized-trophy Stewart, still haven't learnt what it takes to become real actors. At this point, it isn't even funny; it's just pitiful. <br/><br/>The most creepy thing that happens in the movie is the child-birth process, and if creepy isn't bad enough, the movie also makes it disgusting. Bella's face contorts into hideous shapes, she screams like her head is on fire and there is even plenty of blood and biting. Sure, it might be realistic and all but that is not what the viewers paid for. They don't want to know how cross-breeds-between-vampires-and-humans are born. There was absolutely no reason to show it the way they did. Eating your popcorn and drinking coke during that scene is a very bad idea. <br/><br/>Jacob and his muscles are the only sane ones in this almighty mess, after all he seems to be the only one who knows that inter-specie sex is a bad idea indeed. With the exception of Jacob, his muscles and their sanity in this asylum, along with the decent soundtrack, the film is sickeningly obnoxious. What I really want to see after this is what happens after 50 years when they are sick and tired of each other and realize what incredible fools they were to take such drastic (REALLY DRASTIC) steps on mere infatuation. My guess is that they will blame it on the hormones. Everyone does. <br/><br/>Ah, another thing before I forget. The film scores some brownie points for asking some really thought provoking questions like Bella asking Edward ""Are you a virgin?"" or the even more amazing concerning her pregnancy ""I know that it's impossible, but I think I am pregnant... Can this really happen?"" Good questions, Mrs. Cullen."
"zeroforz","1","10","13","1 January 2012"," I even bothered to write a review due to how torturing it is
","I have to say like at the very first movie I was quite a twilight fan. I read all books as I watched the super cheesy trailer (now I realized when I looked back.), and I am too young to resist the so-called 'heroic' action by Robert Pattinson in the first movie. Sorry for that, but I think it could clarify that I was totally not a twilight hater, at least initially.<br/><br/>Kept on watching the following movies, my mind already went blank when I am watching New Moon and Eclipse, though I already found them making no sense, but at least they have a climax that can get my adrenaline level a little bit higher and though I am not a big fan of Jacob's obligatory muscle-showing scenes, I do find the glittering pale vampire's face is kind of my cup of tea. You know people are looking for different thing when they are watching the movies, and for me watching the sequels are just looking at my own brand of eye candy and that's all. <br/><br/>But Breaking Dawn is like the worse thing I've watched in ages. I claimed to my friend that Beastly is the worst movie I have ever watched at least in a decade, now this Part 1 has kicked that down pretty far away. Why spend so much money in making this movie? And why I have to watch those big dogs who claimed themselves as wolves running into forest every time they are unhappy with petty things. The animation seriously hurt my eyes.<br/><br/>Don't know why they are kissing all the time and I felt it's just like the couple's private show or something; Can't understand how can a movie maintain totally no tension throughout; Won't comprehend why everything can be so wrong in a single movie... When you know that the female star can't act at all, what is the reason of giving her a 2 or 3 minutes or a century-long scene without a line? What I can tell from her face is ... nothing. She looked at the mirror, can tell she is trying very hard in changing her facial expression yet without any success. I paid for the movie and I played with my phone instead. Even my eye candy can't help that much.<br/><br/>And when she started to turn into the state of being deprived by their vampire baby (sigh.), she had no make-up and tried hard to act that she is in pain (and I felt like I am in a deeper misery by watching her acting skills), it became hard to keep staring at the screen as she is too unattractive. Apologies that I didn't really watch the so-called climax that she is giving birth to her baby which had more resemblances with a butchering scene, I realized this movie is going to end and I totally have no clue that what I have watched in almost two hours. Apart from the comparatively beautiful honeymoon house and the wedding dress, or maybe also the pretty pale faces of the vampire family, what else could I say with this movie? Seriously, I think the book is not very good either but, this movie proved that it could be worse when it was put on the widescreen. Why bother yourself to spend such a long period of time to watch a pointless movie? I am kind of perfectionist so I am pretty sure that I will have to finish the last movie; but I am quite glad that it is the last one, which could at last put an end to this people-torturing series."
"arunpachat","1","10","13","11 December 2011"," Twilight series dims
","Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not because I'm a Twilight hater. This is just awful. The first hour and 10 minutes was god awfully brutal to sit through. Some scenes were as disgusting as it can get on screen. This slow-moving film has long periods of inaction and generates no suspense and though sometimes unintentionally funny, when they make serious statements. Making it the worst film in the ""Twilight Saga"" films so far.<br/><br/>Waiting for the damn wedding to start while director Bill Condon labours the point that Bella is nervous.<br/><br/>Waiting for the reception to end while Condon labours the point that it's very awkward for everyone.<br/><br/>Waiting for the happy couple to finally get their act together and have sex while Condon labours the point that Edward (Robert Pattinson) is scared of hurting Bella (Kristen Stewart).<br/><br/>Waiting for a baby to be born while Condon labours the point that it is very perilous and Bella might die.<br/><br/>Why did this final story in the Twilight Saga needed to be split into two movies at all? Part 1 could have easily been compressed down to half an hour if all the mind-numbing padding had been taken out of it.<br/><br/>And it really is such a shame, because when the first 'Twilight' movie hit screens way back in 2008, director Catherine Hardwicke turned the script into a captivating supernatural love story, crackling with sexual tension and life, full of promise.<br/><br/>The second installment, 'New Moon', under the direction of Chris Weitz, was so self-indulgent and turgid that I really don't want to say any more about it."

","There are people who hate this Saga, there are people who love it. I am neither hater, nor fan of it. And since I've seen only first movie, which in fact is not as bad as people might say, I didn't get annoyed or aspired by all the other parts. Basically, I took a neutral position when I went to see this movie in a cinema.<br/><br/>I think, it would be appropriate to begin with a storyline. It is pretty solid and doesn't become clumsy over time. However, a lot of movie moments seem to be over dramatized or at least the plot is literally being sucked out of a finger. And the dialogs make the movie even more boring that it might have been.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, poor acting only adds up negative points to movie. From time to time it was hard to believe that the main characters got any emotions.<br/><br/>The final blow is brought by CGI effects. It's like if someone tried to make a movie with a 10-year old computer. That's clearly unacceptable for a high budget movie.<br/><br/>If the movie was incredibly bad or annoying it would be at least fun to watch how it fails. But no it's not that kind of movies. It's soulless. It's an unpleasant experience. It's dull.<br/><br/>3/10"

"sanadan","3","6","7","5 October 2012"," Holding out for nothing
","Now I have seen all the movies in the series. The first was not bad but it wasn't that good either, the second, forgettable, same as the third and now the fourth makes me feel like I really am holding out for nothing.<br/><br/>In a movie you need to make the audience care about the characters. This is to make sure that when something dramatic happens or when you try to build suspension people will actually feel something. You need to either want the person to die or get hurt or you need to want them to be better of. Many movies pull this of in the opening act of the movie, this series hasn't pulled it of in 4 movies.<br/><br/>So far we know almost nothing about the characters in this series, their all cardboard cut outs easy to replace and when ever some one is threatened, close to death or even dies you end up going ""meh"". Why? Because they have no dept. It doesn't seem like the writers are even interested in making these characters interesting. The movie is also very drawn out, far too much time is spent on getting the audience trying to sympathize with the characters but since they have no real character, no personality and nothing about them that makes them likable this just doesn't happen.<br/><br/>The love interests have no chemistry, this makes the drama surrounding it less believable. The lead actress problems and reasons for her actions are so shallow, childish and selfish that you end up disliking her when the intention is the opposite and the male leads end up coming of like easily manipulates sock puppets.<br/><br/>The production value is quite high, this is the best thing about the movie but a polished surface if not enough to endure these drawn out plots that give almost nothing. There is no pay of in the end.<br/><br/>You end up sitting trough the series thinking ""soon, soon something will happen that makes me react, makes me feel something"" but it just doesn't happen. If you have not seen the first movies, don't waste your time on them."
"TrentReznorandAtticusRoss","3","6","7","31 May 2012"," You may as well read the book - the movie's just for people who can't read.
","One would expect that after the success of the first three films- and the third one especially- that the fourth and part one to the final installment to what is now soon to be- a complete twilight quintology, would be in much more better hands, and especially after the praise for breaking dawn. Let's ignore the fact that it's been pointlessly split into two.<br/><br/>There's now zero chemistry completely, almost like Edward and Bella are exhausted of putting on a show. Speaking of which, the sex scene was a little awkward - y'know, the one that got unintentional laughs. Though Jacob does good in keeping his trap shut- no more whining from him now, he's finally an adult. Bella and Edward however, couldn't be any less mature than when this whole thing started. The acting is O.K, although Billy Burke probably still is the greatest actor here. Effortlessely, he portrays Charlie, the slightly confused father, who seems a little under the blanket. And if anybody else calls this inability to act, they are mistaken.<br/><br/>It's when anybody speaks, is when it really turns to stone. The script is repulsive, weak, stating the obvious, and would probably get a better review from many others if this were a silent film. Some actors, like Taylor Launter per say, who finally picked up their act and ACTED, didn't get very much lines. The sentences were shorted, which only created even more confusion- how does Edward REALLY feel about cutting Bella open? How does Carlisle explain to Edward how to cut open his wife's stomach in the midst of ectasizing pain? <br/><br/>There's also zero storyline. Yep, it's a reality show. We're following around two newly weds whilst they bicker amongst themselves about the pros and cons of having a metaphorically demonic child -how do they even know the baby's going to be a threat? It also raises some questions from the Quilliete point of view; What's so bad about a baby hybrid? The length of life time is stretched over aging four years at a time- although the movie doesn't tell you this, so how is the audience supposed to pick it up?<br/><br/>After all this, the audience needs an orgasm. There's nothing to be excited about here. Very much like the fight scene between Harry and Ron in Deathly Hallows part one - once you expect two best friends to beat the living out of each other, they end up - wait for it - pushing each other around. This film definitely pushed each other around. We needed to see the impact of two sides finally going head on, after about a hundred years of keeping the mitts - or paws - off each other. <br/><br/>Overall, a dumb addition to what we though was a healing movie saga. Don't bother wasting your time, you'd get thrice the thrill and excitement reading two chapters of the book that this abortion adapted itself from."

If you read this review don't watch this f*** up of a movie and save 2 hours of your life."
"thebookwormcometh","1","6","7","3 April 2012"," I don't even know why I do this to myself.
","Before I begin, I should preface this by saying that I have not read the books. I don't plan on it. I intend to judge this movie as the movie it is. Also, I'm not even sure why I still watch these movies. I'm not a fan. I'm not on any ""team"". I think it's just me hoping that as long as the ""Twilight"" series is still as awful as I think it is, my judgment and humanity have no been compromised.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this was not a movie so much as a big, frustrating, awkward pause. All of the movies up to this point have been 120 minute set ups for the next movie, and really, the whole series is a 360 minutes leading up to this. Wedding! Sex! So, how did it fail? First, Bella, or ""that one"" as I affectionately call her, still can't peak my interest in her as a character. She doesn't seem to care that she's getting married or that short-haired-vampire is being a super bitch about it. She has no emotion and no purpose. During the wedding reception, minor characters sing her praises, but the film's audience has never seen any of the characteristics that they are claiming she has. But I guess she and Edward love each other? Sometimes I'm not so sure, and I will address that later.<br/><br/>The more I watch of this series then the more I realize that Jacob isn't some smoldering, sexy werewolf alternative to Edward. He's a hormone ravaged 17 year old who has a bright future as inmate number 3135453, in for 20-30 years on charges of aggravated assault, public nudity, stalking, and statutory rape. His character never evolves (but then again, none of them do), and he is incredibly annoying when he yells at Bella for making her own decisions, bewildering as they are.<br/><br/>Let me just take one moment, though to say that Anna Kendrick is the only likable character in the entire series-- not just this movie. Unfortunately, she is underused since she has two lines and 15 total seconds in the film. I would watch a movie about her. As great as she is, it makes it all the more confusing why every guy in Sh*tstorm, Whereeverthismovie'ssettingis is helplessly in love with Bella and not Anna Kendrick.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, things happen, but at an excruciatingly slow pace. It takes 30 minutes to get to the wedding, another 25 to get to the honeymoon, and then a solid hour before the birth scene. There was no reason for each plot point to take that long since none of the scenes are engaging or emotional.<br/><br/>Speaking of things integral to the plot, my biggest gripe is that Edward didn't make Bella a vampire the moment they left the wedding. It would have solved everything. Every problem in the movie, be it Edward hurting Bella during sex or her getting pregnant, and all of the stupid things that happen because of, that would have been solved had he just done the deed. They were on their honeymoon. They could have easily dealt with her transformation, come up with a story to tell her dad, and f*cked like we all wanted them to.<br/><br/>There was one moment when I actually identified with Bella, and that was when she was frustrated that Edward wasn't having sex with her. I was frustrated to. I didn't rent that movie to see two sexy teenagers NOT have sex.<br/><br/>Edward once again proves that he emotionally abusive when he refuses to have sex with her and then berates her for choosing to have the baby. No matter how little sense it made for her to continue her pregnancy, it was her choice and he just made snide comments about how she's gonna die. I can see why she married him. No, I can't. This movie will plague a generation of women because it taught them that the reason their boyfriends abuse them mentally and emotionally is because they really love them.<br/><br/>The next hour of the movie is watching her waste away and listening to people take part in a thinly veiled abortion argument. But this is a good Mormon movie, and so she's having the baby whether it kills her or not. And why couldn't it have? The main scene I was hoping to see was just disappointing. They barely showed Edward violently ripping open her womb and eating the placenta. I've been watching you all be boring for 110 minutes. DO SOMETHING.<br/><br/>Now, there is a filler in this where the werewolves are going to fight with the Cullens because of the baby, and who cares. There is no fight. There is never a fight scene in any of these movies, so why even get your hopes up? There is, though, the introduction of ""imprinting"" which is where.... Actually, it's never explained what imprinting is. Edward just states that Jacob does it to his baby daughter. Since Jacob is a secret canine, I can only assume he marked his territory like all other doges do, and peed on her.<br/><br/>And then it ends with Bella opening her eyes. She's a vampire, now. Jacob is going to be happy with his pee baby, and there can't possibly be anything else to say in this story. But apparently there is. Because there's going to be another one.

","The fourth installment of the successful Twilight franchise takes place when Kristen Stewart's Bella is getting to married to Robert Pattinson's Edward. From then on, it's just a hit-and-miss story that leads to nowhere. Then, Taylor Lautner's Jacob is still jealous of the whole marriage idea. I just wish that he could finally get through his thick head that Bella does not want to be with him. I don't understand why Bill Condon would choose to direct a movie like this. All he adds is just musical montages, and worthless pop tunes. What we should need is thrills, chills, and a plot that needs to get to the point already. They get married, go on their honeymoon, and break the bed, but then these twerps start realizing that everything now goes haywire when Bella is now pregnant, and everybody starts freaking out. This is so sad, because it's like nobody has ever been scared about someone being pregnant before. The wolf gang is now trying to pack up to murder Bella, while talking to each other like cartoons, with wolf mind vision, or something like that. Now, poor Bella is starting to weaken as the fetus starts to grow, and now there's nothing that can happen. Since the first two movies were mediocre, and the third film was surprisingly good, I thought that this movie would have another chance to improve the series. But everything from the uncomfortable sex to the freaky birth scene, the movie just proves that this is leading the series to a dead end. Now, even if fans all over the world have to wait a year for the final chapter in the franchise, the cliffhanger itself ruins the whole series by proving that ""Breaking Dawn"" should never have a Part 2 conclusion. From start to finish, you don't know whether to laugh, be bored to sleep, or smash your head against a window. Pattinson, Stewart, and Lautner try to do their best, but all they do is just stand there and wonder how many more of these movies do they have to make now. This is not better than the last minutes of the final ""Harry Potter"" for many reasons. This is the most freakiest, creepiest, and disappointing movie in the series by far. ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1"", in my review, ""a worthless finale build-up, surprisingly freaky throughout""."
"gretemail","2","6","7","8 February 2012"," 2 of 10
","Two points. One for comedic value and one for campness. It's hard not to make like Freud and keep seeing the author's stunted psychological growth in every juvenile plot turn and scene. The utter serious sincerity with which this deprived teenage fantasy is acted out is pretty Lynchean. The acting is too good for this film. This makes a trippy viewing. Imagine a third rate soap opera that is classically bad and cringe-worthy. But the actors treat it like a quality production. What also contributes to bizarreness is the rather unexpected turn to straight horror when the Thing is about to be born. Basically (although I'm now considering giving it another point for strangeness), this film is only worth seeing if you can make the most out of the campness and the unintended humour. Make it into a drinking game or something."

","Bella is finally tying the knots with Cullen, but marriage between vampire and human brings unusual side effects both physically, and socially.<br/><br/>I thought maybe I was the only one who didn't enjoy this movie, but was pleasantly surprised to find such low rating here.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie was that it had practically no story to it.<br/><br/>I also think the story would have been much more interesting if Bella had married Jacob instead of Edward. Did I also sense that Robert Patterson is running out of steam ? The both actors didn't have enough maturity to carry out the love scenes. Their marriage looked so fake.<br/><br/>One thing I liked was the new home Bella and Cullen settled into. It's a nice mixture of modern and wild. I wish I had a home like that.<br/><br/>This is by far the worst of the series. If Part 2 continues this way, it'll be a dud for sure."

","This movie is so bad. It doesn't even deserve 1 star. The script, acting (with the exemption of Anna Kendrick) and just about everything are awful. The movie extras have more talent than the main characters. This is not worth renting nor pirating. The actors are horrible. When Bella was walking down the aisle, I couldn't make out of her expression if not constipated while faking an orgasm... it was so hilarious and I was laughing my ass off her through out the whole movie. The makeup isn't creative at all too. They look more like ghosts than vampires. Their faces are so white and didn't look real at all. I enjoyed watching the Twilight parody, Vampire Sucks more than this. Anyway, I have billions of bad things to say about the movie and not one good.

","I am not in love with the direction of this film. Twilight was much stronger from just about every aspect even with its low budget and Jacobs odd, awkwardly styled hair.<br/><br/>Bill Condon takes it over the top in the wedding scene and pushes it in the wrong direction away from paranormal romance and young love augmenting it into some odd wannabe ""cult classic"" genre which it falls short of as well. Each progression of this series has become more and more dependent on special effects to save the movie. Breaking Dawn is no exception.<br/><br/>This film lacked just about everything for me. When I get up to use the bathroom the first time through, well...."
"SpiffDico","Null","6","7","5 January 2012"," What the hell?...just...just what the hell?
","I guess before hand, i should talk about the other films just to get it out of the way. The first film, directed by Catherine Hardwick, was a boring schlock-fest, based on the book series that, for some UNEXPLAINED reason, has a cult following. But the first film was just boring, lousy, had no story, bland acting you'd find in an exploitation film, and effects that make Michael Bay fall into a coma with boredom. The Second film, New Moon, had gone lower, with it's effects even cheesier, the acting just as bland, and hundreds of unintentionally funny moments that make the film just as bad. And lastly, Eclipse, which has been considered the best by many, but considered the worst by others. I considered it the worst, due to it repeating the same conversations over and over again, and having a backstory from one of the villains be much more interesting to learn than the bullshit love-story that we have to listen to.<br/><br/>Now...Breaking Dawn...it honestly is the worst of them. I'm not kidding. I'm still trying to figure out how this is possible.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn part 1 is nothing but a padded out mess of a film, that adapts from the book into 2 films, but in this case, THERE'S NO REASON FOR THERE TO BE 2 FILMS! Hell, there's literally no reason for this to be a film series at all! With what little story, character development, and acting, you could easily make the Twilight movies into 3 films at the least! They pad this movie constantly with montages, and yet it's rushed when by the end of this movie she has the baby and becomes a vampire. If you've rushed your movie to where it goes down to the final battle that's coming in part 2, what the hell's the point of even HAVING 2 films?! And plus, for them to mention such grizzly stuff that happens in the book, yet they don't have even decide to go all out on it, then why the hell didn't you just do THAT?! It still would've sucked, since this whole series is crap, but it would've been the least bad of them! Twilight doesn't even deserve to be called a saga, if it has nothing to offer! Story? It padded. Characters? What characters? Heart? It has none. Cinematography? Painful on all levels! If anything, the Harry Potter films are worthy of the name 'saga' because it has all. Story, characters, heart, and great cinematography. I will at least admit, that Stephanie Meyer had an interesting idea. It sounded interesting, but after watching these films, it makes me sick now. These films are butchering the vampire genre! Vampires don't sparkle! Werewolves do not change on their own! Why is Bella Swan considered the icon of teenage girls of this generation? If that's the case, then this is offending every teenage girl AND guy to a high level! For this series to be one of the highest grossing franchises around and MTV giving it the reward for Best Drama and Best Film is shameful. If this series wants to get some...SOME appreciation from everyone as what it's stated by people, then it should be rebooted and redone in a way that people would enjoy! The only characters that are sympathetic are Jake and Charles (Bella's dad). They're reasonable. They have character. They actually know how to do well!<br/><br/>Overall, Breaking Dawn part 1 is POINTLESS! The only reason these films are made are for money. That's all they are! They're cash-grabbers. If anything, these films should be put on trial for assault on the vampire and werewolf genre, and thievery on everyone's wallet and purse!"
"LeelouLO","4","6","7","15 December 2011"," disappointing...
","I had such high expectations before and such a disappointment after watching it. The actors played well their parts. I think Kristin played her best part ever, since the beginning of the Saga. Robert on the other hand, was quite plain. As if the attention was all focused on the Bella character and Edward was in the back. I did not like this. I expected them to be at their best moment, together. I expected the pair to equally share the spotlight or at least feel something when Edward was in the spotlight...<br/><br/>There are huge gaps in the storyline. I found that the moments are not glued well together. It's like, the movie is a brief description of the main moments from the last book and that is all. I cannot see or feel the movie as a whole but only as a collage of video clips."
"ged_2k3","4","6","7","14 December 2011"," over hyped
","I should begin by qualifying my position in the Twilight 'spectrum' as being firmly in the centre of what is a hostile battle between the book loving uber-fans and the self righteous saga-snobs.<br/><br/>I haven't read any of Stephenie Meyer's novels but her success suggests that she's doing something right and, up until now, I have enjoyed the blockbuster adaptations. Sadly, I always suspected that the fourth instalment would struggle to live up to the emotionally charged hype of its legion of fans, and I was right.<br/><br/>Many have drawn comparisons between the Harry Potter series, which also split the last book into two films. Being in the book loving uber-fan category of Harry Potter fans, and given the rich complexity of the story in the final book, I understood this decision, however even I felt some cynicism towards the motivation behind it. In the case of Twilight, without actually knowing what is to come in the conclusion of the series, I can see no other reason for splitting the book than financial reward.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the entire content of Breaking Dawn – Part 1 can be condensed into about 40 minutes, less if you're really stuck: Wedding; Honeymoon; Pregnancy; Birth; Death; Red eyes. That's about the size of it; everything else is largely irrelevant filler. Most films like this start with a 'scene setting' phase before getting into the meat and bones of the story and then end with the climax, yet I found myself about 45 minutes in wondering when we were going to leave the 'scene setting' phase. That said, even the most content bursting follow up would have the space to accommodate the Part 1 preamble.<br/><br/>It had too much angst, not enough content, a worse than usual soundtrack, and cheesier than usual dialogue and was redeemed only by its exciting 30 minute climax (although the overly gory birth scene could have been toned down).<br/><br/>I can only hope that the saga will be saved by the final instalment, and who knows, I may even decide to read the books after all."

Little did I know it would be awkward since every alternate second Bella and Edward are sucking one another's soul. The Vampires are depicted as cool, cultured, impeccably fashionable gods, while the werewolves are ""Black"" peasants wearing normal old clothes, and not looking too delicately pretty themselves. I mean, Leah looks horrible. This makes the vampires seem like the pretty princesses and princes in fairy tales and werewolves as the bad guys. Who the heck would choose the werewolves then? The worst part is, when Bella became a vampire, she suddenly got gold eyeshadow and make up, and the whole theatre laughed. Wow, to become a vampire just so you could have colored eyes without contacts and natural makeup? And still only looking a bit better and certainly not as good as some good ol' humans, I think that is an EPIC FAIL. Just like this movie."

That quote went ""''Mad Dog Time'' is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time."" That's how I ultimately feel about The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1. It is a terrible film that, despite its best efforts, turns into a big pile of nothingness. What did the filmmakers want to accomplish here? Well, there are a couple thing such as money, cabbage, and oh yeah, dough. This film was made on the assumption that millions of teenage girls are going to throw down their allowance to go see it. As I went to a public theater to see this and not an advanced screening, their assumptions was right. I was the only male in the theater. No boyfriends, husbands, males by themselves, ETC. May I also mention that there was a very limited range of females under 16 in the theater. Seriously, who thinks of this crap? This film can be summed up in a simple, short explanation-it's a soap opera made for young women instead of middle aged women. I'm not trying to sound sexist or derogatory but this is the way the world works..movies are made specifically for teenage girls to throw their allowance down.

","I am not sure why Breaking Dawn Part 1 didn't hit me between the eyes but after considerable thought I think it's because it took 1.5 years to get here after Eclipse. Also, the acting was horrible. The movie was way too long for the plot it was supposed to portray. From the beginning it seemed staged from Alice's obvious wig to Edward smirking with doe eyes in almost every shot. <br/><br/>I am not a teenager, in fact I am a grandmother. I was introduced to the Twilight phenom by my daughter a few years ago when she gave me a very used copy of Twilight. I absolutely loved the books and then the 3 DVD's that I watched over and over. Was I excited to see Breaking Dawn? You bet, but as I stated above is was fair at best.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, Billy Burke and the actress playing Bella's mother did the best acting job with enough exposure in the film to determine their performance. The other actors - the Cullen family - didn't seem to be a true part of the movie. Why didn't we see more of Ashley, Nikki, Kellan and Rathbone??? <br/><br/>To me, there is no reason to have 2 parts to Breaking Dawn. Making the movie a bit longer and more precise would have been the thrill I was looking for. I am disappointed in Stephanie Meyer for botching up her own story. Is this all an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the 3 previous movies by making this movie two parts? <br/><br/>The very best part of the entire movie was Bella's transformation from human to vampire with the kicker being opening her eyes at the close of the movie. I wanted this type of thrill in the rest of the movie but it failed to delight.<br/><br/>I am in no hurry to see Part 2 and don't even know when it will be ""revealed"".

It then spent an hour painfully trying to demonstrate vampire sex to tweens. They then leave us with a cliffhanger requiring everyone pay another $12 at the movies to see how the first part ends.

Granted the book was the worst of the three, but with the budget the film had, I hoped for more from the film. How Bella manages to be morose on her wedding day - is beyond me. There is no joy - or chemistry the only spark is between Bella and Jake. The wedding toast is sorry - save for Charlie. The honeymoon - disturbing and silly. The whole pregnancy and childbirth scenario probably did it's job of keeping girls from having sex or at least using protection. <br/><br/>The messages were the most disturbing...Joyless wedding, Painful Honeymoon, Pregnancy that will certainly kill, Horrid Childbirth.

Of course, nobody has any reasons to watch this other than fans of the franchise. The first half hour is the wedding and it's not anything other than a few soap opera highlights. The second half hour is the honeymoon most notable for breaking the bed. When Bella gets pregnant, it becomes fully a soap opera. The baby is a little creepy like 'Rosemary's Baby'.

","It's been a few months now, IMDb. You have no idea what I've done to myself, do you? I don't even know what I've done. What I do know is that ever since I've seen this movie, I'm experiencing terrible headaches and blackouts that last hours and sometimes days on end. I wake up in strange places that I don't recall visiting. My friends and family tell me that I've grown withdrawn and distant. My bedroom wall is plastered in pictures of brunette women, some with red X's over their faces. No matter how many times I rip this down, it mysteriously reappears and I hear someone laughing in my ear even if I'm alone.<br/><br/>But enough about me, let's talk terrible movies. Now correct me if I'm wrong here, but I do believe this movie sucked gigantic, furry balls. Not just sucked, either, we're talking the gravity well of a collapsed star with enough force to rip a planet apart. <br/><br/>Edward and Bella get married. I'm all out of f-bombs to give about their ""relationship"", much like the actor who plays Charlie Swan. Hang on, let me check with Sparkles the Vampire. Nope, he's out of f-bombs, too. Anyway, they spend their honeymoon on a private island off the coast of Brazil and spend their time completely trashing their suite with vampire sex that should theoretically break Bella in every sense of the word. I wish I was kidding. They even have sex in the missionary position because...it was written by someone with strong religious beliefs? It just seems to me a lot of this could have been avoided if Bella learned some cowgirl positions. In the age of smart phones, there has got to be an app for that. (Damn right there is.)<br/><br/>Anyway, this results in a pregnancy and a lot of chess playing. Despite the fact that carrying this mutant vampire abomination is clearly going to kill Bella, she goes balls-deep into pro life territory and discards that tiny particle of character she has to spread the author's propaganda. Remember, impressionable young women: abortions are always wrong even in a Rosemary's Baby kind of situation. Now you know. And knowing is half the battle!<br/><br/>The werewolves don't like this because treaty and they stand around speaking in perfect English in their cartoon dog forms. Jacob trolls the leader and decides to protect Bella who ends up dying in labor, looking a lot like a crack addict on a slab when all is said and done. Good job, make-up team. I mean that.<br/><br/>Jacob then creeps all over the baby by falling in love with it, I think. I'm not sure anymore about how real any of this is. I mentioned the headaches, right? Well, this is my conclusion: this is a sloppily written mess of a movie whose only redeeming factor lies in the unsung heroes of the make up artists. Everything else just falls flat. Even the soundtrack seems to just be going through the motions. Nobody makes any attempt to act (Jacob alone never makes a face outside of mild constipation), the music is bland and...Edward never sparkled in Brazil despite being in broad daylight for most of that sequence. In fact, none of the vampires did. Did I...did I dream that they had established that in the first movie? I don't know anymore. My head is starting to hurt again."
"mcfjr42","1","5","6","8 April 2013"," An Abomination
","The Twilight series has never been good; anyone who's trying to convince you otherwise is a preteen girl. But I will say this: up until Breaking Dawn the movies were at least enjoyably bad. Breaking Dawn, however, decides to suck any joy out of it and fill the film with the worst acting and visuals of the entire franchise.<br/><br/>I won't bother recapping the plot here; there's just no point, especially when the books and films are so prominent in pop culture. Instead, let me get into the many things wrong with this film:<br/><br/>-Kristen Stewart rarely smiles in this film. Oh, there are a few forced-looking smiles, but even at her character Bella's wedding she looks downright miserable. Looking miserable all the time worked well for her in Speak; here in a romantic role like this it's just awful<br/><br/>-The long-awaited sex scene is probably one of the most bland, passionless sex scenes ever put to film. Some furniture's destroyed, sure, but still, that isn't enough to save the lifeless lovemaking that occurs between Bella and Edward<br/><br/>-The stupidity of Bella astounded me in the book, and here it's just as bad. Bella easily lets Rosalie talk her into keeping the baby Edward impregnates her with. This is a girl who hated her and wanted to kill her at one point; they may be family now, but still, Bella shouldn't just blindly listen to her stepsister, especially when it becomes increasingly apparent she couldn't care less if Bella lived or died, as long as she gets the baby.<br/><br/>-The film tries to deal with a topic like abortion. And, surprise surprise, they do a terrible job. The way it's brought up is so blunt it looks like it was written by someone who honestly believes all abortions are performed in back alleys with coat hangers. The handling of such a controversial topic can be done well in the right hands, but the Twilight series and Stephanie Meyer are nowhere close to being intelligent or deep enough to handle a topic like this.<br/><br/>-A lot of scenes involving Jacob and the wolf pack are way too dark; I could barely tell what was going on half of the time in those scenes. Not that what was going on in those scenes was particularly interesting, but it was still rather irritating.<br/><br/>-Jacob, played by Taylor Lautner (who, throughout the series, seemed to be giving an 'Ewan McGregor in the Star Wars prequels'-like effort to actually act), imprints on baby Renesmee. While imprinting is not explained well enough for any viewer to understand how it works, the fact that Jacob will someday be dating the newborn is really uncomfortable. While not outright making Jacob a pedophile, it really makes one of the few likable characters left in the movies a lot creepier. This, of course, is kept from the book, because bad choices and poor writing like this could only be the work of a monumental hack like Meyer.<br/><br/>-The birth scene is one of the few things I've ever seen in a movie that made me sick. Not since I saw some of the cut animal scenes from Cannibal Holocaust has a movie actually made me nauseous. It is one of the most tasteless, disgusting scenes ever filmed.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie. It rivals The Last Airbender film in terms of awfulness. There is so much wrong with this film that it is devoid of the charming stupidity found in Eclipse or even New Moon. If this review doesn't keep you away from this horrific cinematic dung heap, I wish you the best of luck in sitting through it."

Seriously, this whole movie is basically showing Edward and Bella repeatedly have sex. Then, you have to watch Bella slowly die for 40 minutes. What a waste! When I saw the second part, I knew that these could have been put together while only giving the first part 30 minutes or so. The fact that they split this up confirmed that 2 movies was just a way to con people out of their money. Shameful!"

After watching these films,I had somewhat gotten used to these things, and was actually enjoying the movie for what it was......until Jacob ran out of the Cullens' home, and assembled the wolf pack at the lumber yard. When they started talking, my mom and my brother were also looking at the screen in bewilderment, for a moment, we all thought we had been drugged with Walt Disney pills!

","I have a question. What made you get into the line to see thiz movie in the first place? Just to see good looking faces or you want to see Edward and Bella's hot honeymoon. If that is the case then you've got it all. Finally, the end of thiz saga will be completed in thiz last chapter where the chain of major events occurs such as the wedding, Bella's pregnancy and the last battle. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are still in the spotlight, carrying their iconic figures. They both seem to have fun with their roles, however, their acting skills have shown either no decline or an improvement. Get ready for some mellow madness, because the story will grow more intimate. If you are a true fan of thiz franchise, you will be one of them who cheers and screams throughout the movie. You will see the marriage, the honeymoon night and yeah, a lot of kissing coming! What if you are not one of them? O ow! We've got a little problem here. You've definitely got into the wrong theater. Your nightmare is about to begin. It's pretty awkward and monotone to see the couple always flirt and pamper each other. I appreciate the first ""Twilight"" (2008), there were some real romantic atmospheres there. But as time goes by, the chemistry between Edward and Bella looks even more and more overacting. Actually, it has already happened since ""New Moon"" (2009) and ""Eclipse"" (2010). It's Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black who gives a better performance. The other regular Cast members like Billy Burke, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone, Kellan Lutz, Nikki Reed and Peter Facinelli made an exact impression of the previous movies. Three previous movies are directed by three different Directors and it happens in thiz sequel as well. Thiz time, the movie is directed by Bill Condon who is the man behind smash musical hit ""Dreamgirls"" in 2006. Cutting the last part into two movies was a terrible idea in the first place. Recently, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" (2010-2011) had done the same, dividing their final installment into two movies but in that case it looked like a reasonable idea, considering the basic materials are too thick and so much to tell. But for Twilight Saga, thiz is totally insane. They have one purpose and one purpose only, to show more kissing and cheesy scenes. One word, it's awkward! <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Watching Bella or her dad makes me feel uncomfortable. They are so depressing that they just drag you down with them. Bella constantly looks at the ground or is totally scared especially before her wedding. And Edward, well he is such a wimp. At least I laughed a lot, the dialogs are silly, the make up and wigs ( especially Carlisle's hair) look stupid and don't get me started on the wolves. I really liked the first Twilight movie, but Breaking Dawn is apart from the lovely house at the beach really rubbish and nothing really happens.

","I have had a lot of difficulty getting involved in The Twilight Saga. I have seen all four, and none have completely satisfied me. The original is bad, but not that bad. The sequel IS that bad. The third one is the only one that doesn't completely blow. I actually felt hope for the series after seeing that one. Eclipse finally gave us more of a character background, and wasn't pain inducing-ly boring, which is just what Breaking Dawn Part 1, the fourth film, is.<br/><br/>The film doesn't really have much story wise. Bella(Kirsten Stewart) and Edward(Robert Pattinson) finally get married, and on their honeymoon Bella gets knocked up. Interesting, huh? Yeah, but all of that happens in a half an hour. What happens in the rest of the movie? It's not even worth me getting into it.<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 is so boring. I mean, the others were too but this one is really boring. Stewart is a good actress, but not necessarily in these films. I've always felt her talent wasted here. In this one, she looks like hell. But I mean, if I were apart of this movie I would too.<br/><br/>The other actors, well, they deserve what they get. The acting here, for a while, wasn't that bad, until Jacob entered the situation. One of the best things about the original, I realize now, is the fact that Jacob is barely in it. Jacob, who is Bella's were-wolf friend played by Taylor Lautner, is extremely annoying.<br/><br/>When any of the wolves are on screen, the film loses whatever blood it had. Lautner is a terrible actor. Seeing him in the trailer for Abduction nearly made me vomit. Here, despite his abs, he is such an annoying pansy who just can't accept the fact that Edward is better than him. I really loathe Jacob.<br/><br/>I really just don't like these films. They're too boring, too cheesy, the dialogue is too hokey, and occasionally the films are un-intentionally hilarious. Is this as bad as New Moon? No, I will give it that. But yes, it is still a very bad movie, most likely one of the years worst films. Please, avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>C-"

","If you're developing cold feet at the prospect of tying the knot - especially if you happen to be human and your intended a vampire - you may want to avoid watching ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"" written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Bill Condon. And if you are contemplating having a baby with a vampire, then you REALLY don't want to catch this fourth film based on the series of phenomenally successful novels by Stephanie Meyer.<br/><br/>In this installment, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her dreamy vampire boyfriend Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally get hitched, but happiness is fleeting for the newlyweds as the still-human Bella finds herself coping with the most disturbing and problematic movie pregnancy since ""Rosemary's Baby"" (or ""Alien,"" if you want to count that as a pregnancy).<br/><br/>In purely narrative terms, this is a fairly static entry in the series, as Bella wastes away to skeletal status through the ordeal, and everyone sits around discussing the moral implications of having an unprecedented cross-species child, especially when the birth experience itself will likely spell death for the mother. There's a halfhearted attempt at revving up the action when the werewolves threaten to intervene by killing Bella, but the star-crossed and loyalty-divided Jacob (Taylor Lautner) defuses the situation in quick order (it also leads to a ludicrous voice-over conversation among the wolves that provides some unintentional laughs for the audience).<br/><br/>Still, Stewart gets to do more intense acting than she has thus far in the series, and Bella's transformation plus the addition of the child offer new story possibilities for ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2,"" due for release in November 2012."
"kosmasp","2","5","6","19 March 2012"," Actually it's not OK
","I'm assuming you have seen the trailer for the movie (though I guess most don't even care for that, so most reviews will mention what I do, without a ""warning""), so there is no spoiler in here for you. I'm going to tackle a few things that it reveals (of course in the movie in a bigger scale), that are just insane.<br/><br/>While I thought the first Twilight movie was exactly what it promised to be (a wet teenage girls dream, literally in both senses), the subsequent movies (and I assume books, though I haven't read them) seem to lose their focus. While even with the first one I was sure someone ripped of Buffy and mixed it with OC (or any other soap that has beautiful people in it for that matter), I'm not sure what this latest installment is trying to do.<br/><br/>Except having a very bad message for teenage girls (target audience!). It promotes violent intercourse as is obvious by the trailer and even more apparent in the movie. It is also pro Life, in a way that puts Rosemarys Baby into shame. And all the way through you get the pain (maybe even physical) through your bones. Irrational seeming decisions and longing looks make this seem like a parody in itself. But it never quite achieves to really amuse you (although ""Vampires Suck"" couldn't achieve that either).<br/><br/>So while there are still fans out there (and they will strongly disagree with me), who know their books (I even got schooled on some interactions that are only hinted at in the movie), this is a real dangerous movie for all the wrong reasons"
"Samiam3","5","5","6","8 March 2012"," Dawn is breaking, and the audience is going to sleep
","Taking a nose dive down from the certain enthusiasm that was visible in Eclipse, the Twilight saga just went from lean and mean, back to boring and broody.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a film so confusing in its execution that if it were not for the overall lack of blood, I might assume it was a Roger Corman film. It is vile and unsympathetic, and the strangest part is that the way it ends, you might feel like there is no way that a part 2 is necessary. Part 1, might have even been that much more powerful without the knowledge that another film is on the way. This one concludes in the sort of manner that gives the audience an opportunity to use their imagination. Subsequently, the ending is the only good part of the movie; the rest is nonsense.<br/><br/>In addition to having the worst acting of any of the films yet, the character interaction is once again beyond explanation. Most of the movie is spent in the Cullen household with the family and Jacob trying to keep Bella alive, while the baby inside her is draining her of life. A lot of useless dialogue gets exchanged in addition to a lot of grumbling (mostly from Jacob ... again). I also found it humorous how everybody waits for each other to finish a sentence in scenes that are suppose to be filled with panic. These are the kind of scenes where everyone should be scrambling and interrupting each other among other things. I felt like I was watching a play at times. Some credit should go towards the make up department for making Bella look scrawny and disgusting in the latter scenes. The quality of her face now matches the quality of her line delivery.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn, in trying to be a little bit more dark and sinister than the previous movies, instead has become more boring. There's no other simple way to put it ... it's just boring."

","This film was sad... I was expecting something better, especially because Bill Condon was directing this. He directed one of my favourite movies of all time, ""Gods and Monsters"" alongside with other movies like ""Kinsey"" or ""Dreamgirls"". Considering this, I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>The original score of this film is not at all appealing and combined with the bad sound editing makes the movie difficult and unpleasant to listen to.(I mean while you are watching it, it doesn't sound good; you know what I mean). Although some people found the acting ""mesmerizing"", I thought it was dull and how could it be any different in a movie where almost nothing happens. The script was empty and had no sparkle whatsoever.<br/><br/>I consider this movie had no chance of being good from the start, because to me, the premise seems idiotic. I know it's a romantic vampire film, but at least make me believe the humans in this movie are in their right minds.<br/><br/>All in all, I do not think this was the worst movie in the series. I think The Twilight Saga: New Moon still has that covered. But I am fairly disappointed in Bill Condon because, not only did he choose to be part of this project, but above all, this film was not directed well."

","Probably as bad as ""New Moon"", an awful first half drags ""Breaking Dawn"" down pretty far. The whole highly overcooked romance honeymoon-thing dragged out and made me wanna ralph it was so poorly done and kooky. The cheese in these scenes could've taken your nose off. Equally bad was the MTV music cuts, that were littered in scene after scene after scene ad nauseum. Some of the earlier Twilight films and likewise many younger filmmakers and films seem to have a problem with awful music videos that really detract and distract from the main movie content. Only thanks to finally a bit of tension and conflict in the last 30 min, does the movie manage to semi-salvage some interest, but not much or enough.

","I'm not a Twilight Fan, or a Twilight hater, I just don't care. I didn't like the first film, it wasn't horrible but it was just so boring. Then I saw the second one, and was surprised, it wasn't really good, but it was entertaining at parts. Then Eclipse, I would actually call that film OK. So you see where this is going, each film got progressively better, so I was hoping that this film would go into the category of pretty good. It didn't.<br/><br/>This film takes a step backwards, I'm not sure if it's better or worse than the first one, but it's pretty lame. It's kind of sad because there were actually some pretty cool things in this movie. Maybe it was just me, but when Bella was getting ready to walk down the aisle, it kind of looked like she was having second thoughts about marrying Edward and literally throwing her life away, that was pretty cool. The action scenes are fun, but there aren't enough of them. And Bella cares about someone besides herself, that alone makes gives this film a couple of points. And the ending shot was pretty cool.<br/><br/>But as for the bad, there is not enough material for a two hour movie. There are so many scenes that have no purpose and just drag on for too long. Also, the acting is bland. I actually like the three main actors, I've liked Kristen Stewart and Robert Paterson in other movies, and I think Taylor Lautner might be able to act, but the dialog they are forced to speak is just awful. Edward keeps referring to his child as a thing. And there are some incredibly stupid moments, including a scene where the werewolves communicate telepathically. Guys, that may work in the book, but in a movie, that just looks stupid. And someone pointed something interesting out, if Edward is dead, that means he has no blood, thus he can't get an erection to get Bella pregnant.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was incredibly forgettable. It had some interesting parts, but it was pulled down by too many scenes that had nothing to do with the plot. Bland acting, awful dialog, and way too many stupid moments. Let's just hope part 2 will be better. From what I hear (I didn't stay after the credits), Dakota Fanning is supposed to be the villain of the next movie."

","That was the worst movie that I've ever laid my eyes on. The books were somewhat enjoyable, and the first movie was okay. It just all went downhill from there. Bella and Edward scenes were composed only of bad acting and kissing, the two alternating every few seconds. I swear, those sex scenes were way to long and a few seconds would be enough to get the viewers to see the point. Bella just appears as a sex-craving teenager throughout the whole first half of the movie. The wolf scenes were a joke. I don't think anyone could've possibly taken those seriously. The way those scenes were described in the book was so detailed and emphasized, all thrown aside in the movie. I don't remember anything about the wolves attacking the vampires at all, but I guess somehow there was a reason to put it in there. Bottom line, the movie was utterly horrible, though most viewers will continue to Part Two; half are haters who want to continue hating, half are fans who want more. Whatever happens, there will always be someone around to see the next part. I'd rather not be part of that crowd."

The first movie was riveting. This one had me checking my watch. The twinkle bell music running throughout most of the movie was hokey and annoying. Too much time was spent on the wedding. The visualizations were B movie quality, including Jacob's separation from the pack, Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee, and the nightmare. The love scenes should have been more subtly done, especially for the younger audience this series attracts. Another scene or two of Bella's internal agony while transforming should have been flashed. Finally, the hair and makeup in the first movie was perfect; every movie thereafter is completely unflattering to these gorgeous actors, except for Kristen and Taylor.

","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : TWILIGHT : BREAKING DAWN – PART ONE<br/><br/>MINI-REVIEW : Drawn-out prequel to the final chapter<br/><br/>RATING : Wait for the instant download – if you must (Rating System: ""Watch it in theaters"", ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are back and they are going to get married. The marriage goes off without a hitch. While Jacob (Taylor Laughtner) is a bit put out, he makes his peace with it. That is until he learns that Bella plans to let Edward make a woman of her before getting turned into a vampire. ""He'll kill you,"" he warns as he knows vampires go into a frenzy during ""maritals"" (we guess).<br/><br/>But Edward is able to restrain himself and only manages to wreck the bedroom. Strangely, Bella becomes pregnant in the short time they are on honeymoon – and the fetus (baby) is growing rapidly. And we're off...<br/><br/>I recently watch the first three incarnations of the ""Twilight"" series at home before going to the theater to see ""Breaking Dawn"". I thought they were pretty unimpressive stories, but easy to sit through. Breaking Dawn, however, suffers from the fact that it is a mere set-up for the final chapter. There just wasn't enough material to make a full movie. To its credit, the movie pretty much stands on its own with a good beginning, middle, and conclusion. But the scenes that get us to that conclusion are excruciatingly protracted. This movie lasted two hours and could easily have fit in half that time.<br/><br/>There are a number of huge plot holes in this film. Like, why doesn't anyone in the Cullen coven realize that vampire/human sex could create a fast-growing embryo? I mean, the head of the clan is a doctor. The other problems I have would spoil things for you – but at some point I would suggest you ask yourself how digestion works in the ""Twilight"" world.<br/><br/>The real standout in this film, however, was Taylor Laughtner as werewolf Jacob Black. His character is a truly epic hero. He undergoes a transformation from loner to protector and without giving too much away, I expect we'll see him become a leader in the next film. And Laughtner delivers some really solid performances. He is intense, funny, angry, sensitive just a fine array of emotions for an arguably secondary character. I saw him in ""Abduction"" and was not overly impressed. In the previous two ""Twilight"" films, and ""Abduction"" his job was to be buff and more buff – and to run a lot - shirtless. While he manages to keep his shirt on in most of ""Breaking Dawn"", he is the conscience of this film and his performances really support the hum-drum of his partners. And while we're on the subject of werewolves, they are the most interesting characters in the Twilight series. The boys in the tribe, whether in human or wolf form, are always huddling, hanging out, and rough-housing together. And the CGI wolves (while surprisingly huge) are beautiful animals. The actors are interesting to look at and have some substantial secondary plots. Compared, in contrast, to the Cullen clan who seem to just walk around ghost-like with no real relationships.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I'm only watching ""Twilight"" because it is a phenomenon and I want to be able to talk about it around the water cooler. If I were to give my honest opinion of this film, I'd recommend that you don't waste your time. It is a simplistic tale and you won't walk away from the theater with anything more than you walked in with. But if you've seen the previous movies or are a fan of the books then I recommend you ""wait for the instant download,"" because this is just a protracted episode.<br/><br/>A final note: I have also been watching the ""Underworld"" series in anticipation of the upcoming release of ""Underworld: Awakening,"" (which also is a vampire/werewolf movie). Once I've reviewed the final chapter of the ""Twilight"" series and ""Awakening"" I plan a comparison of the two franchises. I think there will be some interesting parallels."

","i am a big fan of the books and have enjoyed the previous movies despite their faults. this movie missed the mark on all accounts. while it hit on all the major events of the books it ignored the character stories that made those moments important. the movie as a whole was one montage after another all laced with a horrid soundtrack with no sense of finesse. certain scenes were indeed laughable, the wolf submissive scene was pathetic. the only bright points of this movie were the actors themselves who have all found a smooth talent with these characters. in all if this had not been based on the books that i loved so much i would have walked out, something i have never even considered before."

","-----Spoiler Alert-----<br/><br/>I've read the books, and watched all of the movies to date.<br/><br/>We all know by opening one of the books or going to the theatre for this franchise that you expect it will be mediocre, and by no means a prestigious award winner. You take it for what it is.<br/><br/>This movie is cheesy, awkward and trying too hard. It is by far the worst of the franchise, so far...<br/><br/>At the beginning, a shredded and shirtless Jacob is running in the rain after receiving the wedding invitation, which makes me hang my head in shame that I also find him appealing.<br/><br/>Moving on...<br/><br/>The over-hype of the honey moon love making scene... seriously, it was nothing. It was not tantalizing, I found it awkward. And on a side note, I give Pattinson and Stewart a year after the final movie, that relationship is dripping with a public relations agenda. It also makes me wish that Henry Cavill was cast as Edward, because he is delightful on all levels. They really tried to make Bella look like a vixen and I found it repulsive. <br/><br/>This movie spent way too much time overcompensating due to the build up of the physical between Edward and Bella.<br/><br/>The werewolves communicating while in being wolf form was so cheesy it was painful. <br/><br/>I will give props to how they made Bella look gaunt and zombie-esque while being pregnant. The birthing scene was gross considering the PG 13 rating it has. The sounds alone will make you cringe, in addition to Bella's back breaking.<br/><br/>I like Seth's character in the movie, and in print. His character is true to what he feels is right and has courage.<br/><br/>I did like the fight scene, and it was cool to see the wolves running through the forest and basically focuses on all of their senses while doing so.<br/><br/>This franchise has nothing on Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. Mindless entertainment, mediocre acting, and an attractive cast (for the most part).<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it attracts such a diverse and wide audience that it doesn't matter if it's a master piece, it is already bringing in so much revenue. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the Hobbit :)"
"lizpierce","10","135","278","16 November 2011"," Leaves you breathless
","It's hard to describe this movie in just 1,000 words but I'll try to keep it short. I'm a huge fan of the books, but I've been disappointed with the last two movies so my hopes weren't that high for this one. I shouldn't have worried. Breaking Dawn blew me away from the first scene. <br/><br/>Stewart is finally acting, which is one of the biggest reasons why this movie is so much better than the others. She portrays Bella in a way that is so close to the book, and it's wonderful to see her and Pattinson playing lovers that are so, so, so in love. The fact that Bill Condon (director) gave the happy couple so much time to be just that, happy, makes you really believe in their love and it makes you understand why they can't live without each other. Such an important part (or THE most important thing I should say) but something that the previous directors have failed in showing. <br/><br/>This movie takes you from a beautiful wedding, complete with the most hilarious toasts (Jessica and Charlie) wonderful music, stunning dresses and declarations of love that will touch everyone's hearts, to South America for a sexy, funny and exciting honeymoon where we see heartfelt smiles, kissing, cuddling and teasing along with the epic headboard breaking scene. <br/><br/>It then settles back in Forks, where we get to witness the most terrifying pregnancy imaginable. The special effects team deserve an Oscar for the work they've done on making Stewart look like she's slowly fading away.<br/><br/>The moments leading up to the birth scene are actually scarier than the scene itself. It really is a horror film towards the end, and some scenes should maybe have been rated R. It ends in the perfect place, such a natural and obvious cut. <br/><br/>I am so thankful that Breaking Dawn has been split into two parts, because I can't imagine even once scene in this part that could have been skipped. Condon is a genius."
"estebangonzalez10","4","54","104","18 November 2011"," Four stars for the Fourth and Worst Film of the Franchise
","¨No measure of time with you will be long enough. But we'll start with  forever. ¨ The biggest winners of the Twilight Saga are definitely  going to be the producers since they managed to stretch the last book  of the series into two separate films; which means a lot more money in  the box office. The problem is that this first part feels so stretched  out that nothing really seems to be happening. The two hour movie could  have been only half an hour long, but in order to make more money the  producers decided to give us an extended wedding and honeymoon scene.  To be honest I really enjoyed the first two Twilight films, I felt the  third was a little repetitive, but this latest film is by far the worst  in the series. There are some scenes which are just ridiculous and  laughable (the mind reading scenes between the wolves for example),  although there are a couple that worked really well and were the  highlight of the film (the bloody birth scene reminiscent of a famous  Pulp Fiction scene). I've never read Stephenie Meyer's novels so I  didn't know what to expect, unlike most of the fans of the franchise  who have already read the novels and know what is going to happen. The  first two movies surprised me, but then the fantasy wore out and the  love triangle got boring. It's gone downhill for me since, and this  latest film directed by Oscar winner Bill Condon is one of the worst  films of the year in my opinion. All I can hope for is that the second  part will work and end the franchise decently with a little more action  or at least a decent plot. A scene after the end credits with the  Volturi's gave me a little hope. Micheal Sheen is the best actor in  this series and it's a shame he barely got any screen time.  As for the plot goes, nothing really seems to be happening that we  haven't seen before. The staring contest continues between Edward  (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart), and more tension ensues  between Edward and Jacob (Taylor Lautner). The wolves continue to growl  and run all over the woods while disputing with the Cullen's. The  Volturi's are the ones that are left out of the film in this first part  (until the credits that is). This fourth part begins with the wedding  that is about to take place between Edward and Bella. Bella's best  friend, Alice (Ashley Greene) is doing her makeup and helping her out  with the fashion while the guests are arriving to the ceremony. The  wedding is beautiful, everyone there looks great, and the toast after  the ceremony is perhaps one of the funniest scenes of the film where we  have several of the characters give some funny speeches like Bella's  dad, Charlie (Billy Burke), who warns Edward that he knows how to use a  gun if any harm is done to his daughter. Then there is also Bella's  mom, Renee (Sarah Clarke), who sings a lullaby she used to sing for  her, and Edward's parents, Dr. Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) and Esme  (Elizabeth Reaser), who welcome Bella into their family. Edward's  vampire brothers (played by Nikki Reed, Kellan Lutz, and Jackson  Rathbone) are also present at the wedding and everyone is happy. Then  it's time for Edward and Bella to go off on their honeymoon to Rio and  finally consume the act. Edward doesn't want to convert Bella into a  vampire until they have sex so he is going to wait after the honeymoon.  The problem is that Bella gets pregnant with this vampire baby  exceedingly fast and her health is threatened.  The entire film seems as sort of an introduction to the final film,  there is little going on really in the movie. I wonder if Twilight fans  will sincerely enjoy this movie. To be honest I really liked the  Twilight series at first, but it has grown repetitive and old, and the  dialogue continues to get worse. The script was never the highlight of  the franchise, it was about the characters and the fantasy world which  was created, but instead of getting better the script continues to get  cheesier and dumber by the minute. There is no reasonable way anyone  would actually enjoy this film over the others. I think this was a weak  effort and the material was never meant to be split into two films. The  problem is that fans of the series are going to go see it anyways and  the producers will be the ultimate winners. I expect most girls will  enjoy this movie however in a similar way as they enjoyed staying up  late to watch Kate and William's wedding. I don't think many guys will  actually enjoy this film, and many will probably be dragged by their  girlfriends."

","This movie was awful. I have seen some bad movies in my time, but this one was just simply pointless and a complete waste. They wanted more $$$$ that is the only explanation and reason I can gather for even making a ""2 part"" finale!!!! The movie was drawn out, slow and I mean SLOW, and they just over dramatized every tiny pointless tidbit that they could to simply get 110 minutes worth of film for us to suffer through. I would venture to guess there is MAYBE 5 minutes of actual action in this film, 5 minutes. This movie should have concluded with the final chapter and the first part could of been summed up in 20 minutes and moved on to the final conclusion of what part 2 is suppose to bring us. For many movie goers and fans of Twilight I would assume this is a major disappointment and the fact that it comes on the heels of the conclusion to the series could be a potential disaster to the franchise as many fans may be tempted to give up on this now after this part 1 misery! I applaud the directors and producers and creators of this filth for single handedly destroying all promise and potential and excitement to Twilight series. Harry Potter final 2 part movie had a purpose and flare & substance and kept you on edge and intrigued. This first part left you angry and frustrated and annoyed and hopeless and with out a doubt wanting your $$$$$ returned to you!!"

","As a twilight fan of both the books and the movies, this movie really disappointed me. I was so excited to see the final book interpreted into film but now that I have seen it they should have left it as a book.<br/><br/>The constant soundtrack did nothing to distract you from the poor acting, obvious dialogue and ridiculous montages. I found myself, and also all of the other movie watchers, laughing at all of the emotional scenes. the funniest when the Jacob defied the pack leader in confusing growl battle. <br/><br/>This film played directly to the 12 yr old female fans and was so overly cheesy it was comical. Do not waste your time or money. You will never get those back."
"ali2141","9","44","85","18 November 2011"," Heaven for Twilight fans!
","If you've read the book, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Out of all the Twilight movies, this one was absolutely most true to the text. As a Twilight fan who has re-read Breaking Dawn over 10 times, I was very pleased with how the movie captured the book's insane, emotionally extreme nuttiness. The book is insanity, and this movie is INSANITY.<br/><br/>It starts off like a romantic comedy, surprisingly light and humorous considering it's a Twilight movie. The whole honeymoon is achingly sweet, and I was smiling the whole way through. It was lovely and quite refreshing to see Bella and Edward laugh so much. The sex scene was beautifully emotional, if lacking slightly in details. Unless fans have some extreme voyeuristic tendencies or something, it'll be satisfying enough. <br/><br/>Then, after the first 45 minutes or so, there's an entire genre change. It's like if watching The Wedding Planner (or some equally cheesy chick flick) and suddenly the female lead goes after the male lead with a chainsaw seeking bloody murder. I suppose if you haven't read the book, the shift in mood could give you whiplash and leave you utterly concerned. But for someone like me, who's read and also loves melodramatic theatricality, the horror/comedy combination was thrilling. It was disturbing in the best way. If you've ever had creepy clown dreams, it's somewhat like that. <br/><br/>The second part of the movie was truly grotesque, mostly due to how sickly thin Kristen Stewart looks. The digital/CGI team did a fantastic job, with the end result being more-or-less reminiscent of a concentration camp survivor. There was one scene in particular, where Bella is looking at her emaciated form in the mirror, that was truly scary. I didn't think it was possible to see someone's spine outlined so clearly. As for the birth scene: it was less visually revealing that I thought but horrifying and incredibly sensory all the same. Again, Bella's corpse-like frame is incredibly disturbing.<br/><br/>What I loved most about this movie were the emotional extremes. Where the past three Twilight movies are subtle and reserved, this one goes all out, portraying everything from euphoria to unthinkable agony. The blissful scenes at the beginning are such a stark contrast to the agonizing scenes at the end, it almost made me want to cry. The key word to describe this movie is INTENSE. <br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part 1 loses one point from me because there is far too much wolf pack for my liking. Most of the wolf scenes were awkward and almost humorous when they were supposed to be serious. A good example is the scene where Jacob breaks from the pack. It was utterly ridiculous and weird. Plus, few members of the wold pack could act to save their lives. <br/><br/>As for the acting chops of the big three, they varied. Kristen was surprisingly phenomenal. Taylor was at times tolerable, and at times painfully awkward. Rob held his own, but it's fairly difficult to judge him because he didn't play nearly as prominent a role in this movie as I would have liked him to. <br/><br/>Recommendations: Watch it if you've read the book. Otherwise, you'll be confused and no one really wants to hear you complain: ""How DARE they not waste half an hour explaining everything to me in detail??!!"". Also, I suggest you don't eat anything before or during this movie. Finally, make sure you stay in your seat for five minutes after the credits start rolling."
"Leofwine_draca","2","6","8","26 May 2014"," The worst Twilight yet
","BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE is the penultimate entry in the teen vampire romance TWILIGHT saga, from the books by Stephenie Meyer. And it's an absolute stinker of a movie! I've been indifferent towards the other entries in this series, but they were masterpieces in comparison to this, one of the worst I've seen in a good while.<br/><br/>Everything is wrong with the film, but the story is particularly terrible. The actual number of events in the plot is extremely small, meaning that this is overlong and dragged out to an endless degree. For long, excruciating stretches of screen time, absolutely nothing happens. It's a story of a girl getting married to a vampire, and that's it. No conflict, nothing. Just boredom.<br/><br/>There's absolutely no reason to watch this. The leads, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, are clearly bored by the material and their characters are listless and lacking in emotion. The werewolf pack is shoehorned into the storyline once more but their presence is extraneous to say the least. And there's absolutely no suspense, no tension, no stand-out scenes to recommend. I think the book of BREAKING DAWN was split into two movies by Hollywood money-grubbers and, like HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART ONE, the resultant film turned out to be an exercise in greed, nothing more."
"Robert_duder","2","6","8","11 February 2012"," This series bottoms out into some of the worst cinema created
","I have honestly tried very hard to see what the fans see in this series. The first film was bad, and then the second two I managed to find some redeemable aspects in and now this one, part one of the two part 'epic' finale and I am simply blown away. This series has to go down in the history books as a mind blowing mass hypnosis that makes people believe what they are watching is epic. This film especially, Breaking Dawn Part 1, was absolutely utter garbage. It literally had one saving grace and that was the wedding and the Honeymoon locale was lovely to look at. The rest is junk. It is boring, poorly acted (as they all have been), horrifyingly lacking any depth or action and just simply awful. I don't get it, I don't understand how anyone can look at this film or the entire series and rave about it, or how it has made a billion plus dollars. I've examined it from every angle, I've looked for every possible redemptive quality and I see nothing. I also see review after review after review harping on it, saying how terrible it is, and if this were true then WHY IS IT MAKING SO MUCH MONEY!! How did we let this crap get made for five movies?!? <br/><br/>I've said it before but I don't believe Robert Pattinson is necessarily a bad actor. I think this series will destroy any future career he has and same for the rest of them. He is awful, creepy, stupid looking, and boring in this film. He's a vampire that never does much of anything. Kristen Stewart's success in this film is how amazingly awful they make her look when she's suffering from her demon child. She actually looks quite beautiful in the first part of the film, the best she has ever looked but her character, as always, is boring and creepy. The chemistry between her and Pattinson is downright stupid and non-existent. Taylor Lautner returns to overact his way throughout the whole thing. Graciously he's in this film less and while he's always had better chemistry with Stewart than Pattinson, its still pointless. The rest of the Cullen/Swan/Wolf family all return in full vigor acting as bad as ever and keeping you barely awake through the whole film.<br/><br/>I don't understand how director Bill Condon who has worked on far more serious projects, though none outstanding, could look at this script and think, ""Yes let's do this!"" They have to know how completely awful this is. Maybe they just know that Twilight has millions of people mesmerized so it wouldn't matter what they'd do. As far as I'm concerned they could have played two hours of Edward picking Daisies and people would have reacted the same as they did to this film and it would have been equally as interesting. This was utter crap. Watch the first half hour for the wedding and some of the scenery and then turn it off and do yourself a favor and don't support this series anymore than it already is. This was really frightening at how bad a movie can be and still make money. 2/10"

","'THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1': One Star (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The first of a two part adaptation of the fourth (and final) book in the immensely popular vampire teen romance saga (by Stephenie Meyer). Kristin Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner and the rest of the cast all return to this excruciatingly drawn-out chapter. Melissa Rosenberg wrote the screenplay once again (she's written every film adaptation in the series) and Bill Condon (of 'DREAMGIRLS' fame) directed this time around. If you've hated the other chapters in the series you'll undoubtedly hate this one as well but oddly even a lot of fans are severely disappointed with this film (which surprises me because most of the things that are awful in it have been awful the entire franchise, so I didn't really notice anything that different.) It is undeniably the worst of the series though, for me it wasn't that much more painful to watch than any of the others.<br/><br/>This time around Bella (Stewart) marries Edward (Pattinson), much to Jacob's (Lautner) disappointment. Jacob is even more upset when he finds out, at the reception, that Bella plans to consummate her marriage to Edward while she's still human (which could hurt or even kill her). A great deal of the film is then spent with Bella and Edward on their honeymoon and the dangers of vampire/human sex become more and more apparent. Things especially become gloomy when Bella realizes she's pregnant with a nonhuman baby. This puts her in grave danger when the wolf pack learn of the pregnancy and decide they must stop it.<br/><br/>This film is pretty much just more of the same trash that's populated the rest of the series but things just drag on more. The dialogue and acting are atrocious and Stewart (the strongest actor of the series) is severely underused and her part is underwritten. There's a strong pro-life message, even at the risk of the mother's life and bringing a possible deadly demon in to the world, that a lot of people have a problem with and there's a lot of life threatening sex. The movie is a joke like all the others and like all the others it is extremely humorous in unintentional ways and entertaining just due to it's overwhelming cheese factor. Some fans of the series will enjoy it but most will hate it and no one should see it, unless you're just looking for a good laugh I guess.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8"

The man that has stolen the show, taylor lautner, since he took his shirt off in the second movie was pushed into the background a little bit in this movie, which i think was the worst thing they could have done. but, in the same token, they had to do as its a love story between edward and bella, not bella and jacob. I'm just a little disappointed by the way they've dragged this on. but i was disappointed by the books towards the end too. <br/><br/>We took our whole office at the penrith professionals and there were mixed reviews.

"markdroulston","4","56","113","16 November 2011"," More rant than review. Apologies..
","One of the most impressive things I have seen in the cinema this year was the final chapter in the Harry Potter series, not necessarily because of the quality of the film, but rather how Warner Bros. managed to maintain the quality of the franchise over ten years and eight films. Seeing the end to a cinematic phenomenon, one which we are unlikely to see the likes of again for quite some time, is bittersweet, but The Deathly Hallows, part two managed to tie everything together in a satisfying, if not ultimately surprising manner. While maybe the film didn't need to be split into two, it's hard to imagine that many fans of the series would be disappointed in how the conclusion turned out. Now that Harry Potter has ended, the next huge franchise soon to end is the Twilight saga, and, like Potter, in the interest of selling twice the number of tickets the finale Breaking Dawn has been split into two films. I can understand why Harry Potter is such a beloved franchise. We are given a compelling, easily relatable hero who bravely stands his ground against everything awful that is thrown at him, while also dealing with the realities of growing up and facing responsibility. Surrounded by the fantastical world of wizards, potions and dragons, there is something so real about Harry that grounds the story for us. Twilight on the other hand is a complete mystery. I honestly cannot understand the popularity of these books and films, and if I had children of my own I probably wouldn't allow them to watch this series. It's upsetting that this has become the standard of young adult fiction, and how anyone, regardless of age, could find this nonsense even slightly romantic is baffling. That said, Breaking Dawn, part one is an absolutely fascinating film, filled with more bizarre moments than the previous three films combined, and it's almost worth seeing just to bask in the sheer lunacy of it all. Almost.<br/><br/>Following an opening scene which allows Jacob (Taylor Lautner) to take his shirt off, Breaking Dawn begins with the lead-up to the moment everyone has been waiting for: the marriage of Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson). Predictably the scene is pure wedding porn, dragged out to a ridiculous length, but interestingly highlights the biggest problem with the Twilight saga right from the outset: Bella and Edward are a terrible couple. Bella seems so disconnected from Edward, even scared of him. They're supposed to be this perfect couple, but their relationship is so weird and distant that it just never seems right. Only when Jacob appears at the wedding does Bella seem to come to life, suggesting that she probably should have been with him all along. But no, she and Edward are married and set off for their honeymoon on the Cullen family's private island (after an inexplicable stopover in Rio de Janeiro). So far, so humdrum, but luckily it's at this point that Breaking Dawn really goes off the deep end. Given free rein following the success of the earlier books, it seems that author Stephenie Meyer had no-one around to question the decisions she makes regarding this story, all of which are completely insane.<br/><br/>First, the love scene. It has been established that vampire/human sex is potentially dangerous, and that Bella's life is in danger if she and Edward wish to consummate their marriage. So, what Meyer expects to be a touching, romantic moment between young lovers becomes a sick, voyeuristic ordeal that leaves Bella bruised, and the bedroom in ruins. Thankfully, in the interests of salvaging the film's PG-13 rating, the scene is brief. Much has been made of Twilight's theme of abstinence, but is Meyer really that terrified of intercourse that, even after the wedding, sex is still so closely aligned with physical abuse? Next, Bella instantly becomes pregnant with a half human, half vampire demon child which grows at such a rate that it begins to consume its mother from the inside. There's some mention of abortion made which is more or less forgotten right away, bringing up another problem with this series: Meyer isn't able to effectively convey what her themes are at all. There are so many random moments where some message seems to be coming through, but before it can be explored it's forgotten, or more likely replaced by another obscure metaphor which doesn't make ay sense. Maybe it's because I'm not in the targeted teenage girl demographic, but it seemed that for at least half of this film I was left scratching my head.<br/><br/>Review continues at tinribs27.wordpress.com"

","The movie is not to the level of expectation. Although, the book is better, it is hard to represent everything in visual. The worst part of the movie is releasing it as two parts. Anyway let bygones be bygones. The performance of Kristen is fantastic. But the rest of the team don't support her performance. The nocturnal fight can be made better with little increase in brightness. Twilight series is in the high level of expectation to the people who don't read book. Let us expect some good plot in conclusion.<br/><br/>One famous critic says the following. "" Based on a portion of the popular teen romance book ""Breaking Dawn"" this slow-moving film has long periods of inaction and generates little suspense, making it the worst film in the ""Twilight Saga"" films so far. This movie seems to be a mere multimillion dollar bookmark, marking time until the overarching story is finally concluded in the last film. Short on plot developments and long on inaction, the characters spend much of the film waiting for something, anything to happen.<br/><br/>This third film in the Twilight Saga opens with the marriage of the human Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) to the vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). This is followed by the honeymoon in South America. A good deal of time is spent in transit to and from South America. Although a private jet is involved in this trip, most of the traveling scenes are in cars or limousines. These are awkward sequences where nothing really happens. When the newlyweds finally have sex, the act is underplayed, and not repeated during the honeymoon. Once again, the chastity theme comes to the fore as the husband broods over the safety of his wife and his wife's bruises resulting from his partial loss of self-control during sex.<br/><br/>So the bride and groom are on their honeymoon on a fancy island resort, but they are still waiting for something else to happen, namely the act of turning Bella into an vampire. Why they don't just go ahead and get it over with isn't explained very well. When Bella's other boyfriend, Jacob the werewolf (Taylor Lautner) finds out about this human-vampire honeymoon idea, he thinks it is crazy. While everyone is waiting for Bella to become a vampire, something else happens. Bella becomes pregnant. This, of course, requires more waiting to see what happens with the pregnancy.<br/><br/>After more limo scenes, the bride and groom head back to the family compound in Washington where they spend the rest of the film waiting to find out what happens with the baby. More waiting, more interminable chastity. Just like any marriage. There is a brief flurry of action at the end of the film when another battle between the vampires and werewolves starts to flare up, for no good reason, by the way. During all this, amazingly, nobody bothers to tell Bella's father that she might be dying, or that she has decided to join the undead vampires anyway, even if she survives the birth. Instead, Bella lies to her father, telling him she is at a spa in Switzerland. I guess everyone decides that Bella's father has no right to be at his daughter's side as she fights for her life. This is just heartless and wrong, but it is just one of many wrong things in this twisted story.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the film's ending, but almost all of the plot and what little action there is in the film is back loaded into the last few minutes of the film. The film's running time of nearly two hours is overlong. It is more like one hour of plot padded out to two hours. Surprisingly, the one character who undergoes much of a change in the film (until the last second of the film) is Jacob. While most of the characters in the film are passive and childlike, Jacob actually grows up and becomes an adult in the film. He takes a stand against the leader of his wolf pack and starts his own pack. Unfortunately, this doesn't last long. He reverts back to passivity because of something called ""imprinting"" and once again loses his will. Completing the image of loss of will, he even falls to his knees as if he were worshiping the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.<br/><br/>I get the feeling this film is similar to ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part One."" It seems to be an artificial creation, manufactured to make an additional $700 million that the studio would not have gotten if they had just made one ""Breaking Dawn"" film instead of two. If you are going to make movies of a series of books and you plan to make the movies true to the books, then do that. Don't try to manufacture additional movies by splitting a book in two. It doesn't work. At least it hasn't worked with the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises. This film rates a D."""
"larock28","Null","7","10","21 November 2011"," Disappointed........and I really wanted to like this movie.
","I loved the books and all the movies, except this one. I think the problem is the director. This guy was clueless when it came to vampires and wolfs. He did a good job with the honeymoon and with Bella's scenes after she returns from the honeymoon, but everything else was not good. The wolfs seemed average size and the wolfs communicating was a disaster, and where's the Cullen family and the interaction between Jacob and his pack? If this movie had been directed by the one who did New Mood, you would have seen a really good movie, but with this director, we are just seeing an OK movie. I'm almost afraid too see what he's done with part II......"
"gary-218-520534","Null","9","14","20 November 2011"," Quite awful
","I am not familiar with the back story or this saga. I saw this film as when I turned up at the cinema, the screen for the film that I wanted to see was full, so I saw this as we had nothing better to do. Or so I thought! Frankly, with hindsight, I think I would have rather walked the streets. This film really is awful. It's boring, tedious, corny, over-long and so slow that at one point I thought it was going backwards. With wooden acting, disgraceful screenplay and without even decent CGI to add a bit of entertainment, I cannot really mention anything to redeem it. The cinema was full of screaming, giggling girls, so maybe that sums it up......"

","Really?? Seriously? I waited over a year for this? Yes I read all the books more than once, yes i have seen and own the other 3 movies and NO i did not like this movie one bit. The whole storyline was pretty much told in the media and in the trailers. Big deal they get married and she is pregnant with his vampire baby.....we didn't need over 2 hours to tell us that. The scene with the talking wolves was outright ridiculous. why not make them human to speak and than phase to fight.<br/><br/>the only scenes that were worthwhile was the dream sequence in the beginning and if you stayed long enough (only stayed cause i thought i dropped my credit card) you got to see a 30 second segment with the Volturi after some creditsrolled.

","For another month in the fourth consecutive year the world is thrust into the dull world of Twilight, where some enjoy the eye candy, some are looking for a faithful adaptation of Stephanie Meyers' novels, and I'm thinking ""How on Earth does one describe these films as 'good'?""<br/><br/>Yet again, I see no ultimate redeeming factor in this latest film of the series. The acting is better than ever, but that honestly does not say much when looking back at how bad the performances were in the predecessors. The second half of the film managed to hold my interest, but then I realized I was staring into a screen. The only real conflict is whether Bella is able to conceive her baby or not. Charming.<br/><br/>Then there's the birth scene, which has gone through media magnification. It's not as bloodcurdling as it has stated to be in my opinion. Nor are the much-talked-about sex scenes. <br/><br/>The undercurrent of the film continues to be the ""why it's important to have a boyfriend"" message which honestly cannot be cared for anymore, especially when it's in a story that struggles to identify with an audience - do any women out there have a vampire of a boyfriend, literally?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that the vampire/human relationship makes for a pointless narrative, because we've witnessed the amount of conflict happened in the story over the past three films. On a further note - the conflict has happened very late into the films, since the plot is driven so damn slowly every time, taking an hour to fully settle and engage us spectators. <br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Pt 1 is strictly for fans of the series who will enjoy it as much as they have enjoyed the last three films. I've never read the books but have read from sources that Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay faithfully adapts the first half of the novel onto the big screen, so there's a bonus for die-hard fans. <br/><br/>It's obviously up to those who aren't fans to decide themselves if they wish to see it or not but take my word - ask yourselves, how do I enjoy a film about a woman getting married to a vampire and watch their life as a couple for the first hour, then attempt to enjoy the second hour where the thrill of the drama is centered on whether a woman can give birth or not?<br/><br/>Extra note - I do admit that the last shot of the film is spectacular and creates many enigma's on what is to happen in part 2."

","One of the things you must have in mind when you sit in the movie theaters to watch ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part1"" is that you will be blown away in both, the awefully epic and the bloodily gasping. For those Twilight haters, this will cause you to love Twilight, because unlike Eclipse, New Moon and Twilight itself, had no unlimitation of action. This one is tuly emotional, tear-jerking and mind-blowing in action-packed sequences. The wolf battles are much intense, the action between vampires is very prolonged and awesomely paced, and for the moment the loyal Twilight Freaks have been waiting for: The Birth Scene. It was incredible. I was in the brink of crying as soon as Edward said. ""Renesmee, a changing heart"". And I'm a man who is not easily convinced by 'emotional' scenes. But the birth scene just made me weak. The blood level was kind of over-rated for a PG-13 movie, but I will not ruin the surprise. A must see for everyone!"

","Before heading to the theater, I came here to read some reviews and check the rating so that I would know what to expect. After realizing that it had a very low rating and bad reviews, I started having my doubts. However, after watching the movie, I discovered that I should never judge beforehand. It was a total different experience from what I expected to see. Besides, I was not the only one who was impressed. Nearly all those who were attending felt like the movie went beyond their expectations which honestly was a total surprise given that the previous parts where not so good. I will not say anything except that this installment will deliver and is definitely the best one of all--till now. Do not let the bad reviews here influence you. Do not let the rating scare you away. You go, watch and judge. You will not regret it--I'm just sayin!"
"MagentaMagenta","10","22","42","27 November 2011"," Breaking Down
","Oh, Bella, gorgeous Bella. I'll try to be as impartial as I possibly can (may be hard though).<br/><br/>This is my very first review. And this is the first Twilight film I actually watched at the cinema too.<br/><br/>First thing that comes to mind to any normal person is, why, oh why would someone watch a movie like this? Well, to be perfectly honest, I DO NOT KNOW. I certainly know why I went to see it, though: I hadn't been to the cinema in about 6-7 years; so I made a sort of half-serious remark on Facebook stating that the best way to return to the cinema after so many years would be to go watch Breaking Dawn. It'd be the perfect humiliation, you know. <br/><br/>To make it short: me and a couple friends ended up going to watch it and offer our most constructive criticism throughout the course of the movie. <br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, it wasn't as terrible as I expected. I mean, it's your typical teenage-drama-horror-comedy flick. Oh, yeah, and it's also a vampire movie (I think). There are some unbearably boring moments (i.e. most scenes with Bella in it), but other than that it's a pretty funny movie (as in ""ROFLOL, this actually IS supposed to be serious!! But it's hilarious!!).<br/><br/>Anyway, right at the start you are greeted by Jacob's manly, manly chest. So that's a plus for the Jacob fan-girls/boys. I promise every time Jacob comes into a scene, you'll be waiting for him to take off his shirt (he doesn't do it all the time, though--probably because if he did, too many people would faint from orgasms--but you can always strip him naked with your eyes anyway ^.~).<br/><br/>Then we have Edward and Bella's wedding. Boring stuff. The expression in Bella's face is so... how can I put it? Homogeneous perhaps? Looks as if she always was in a perpetual state of excruciating anguish and sorrow--or perhaps she's just constipated by nature.<br/><br/>Poor girl. <br/><br/>Pray to the Gods you don't catch Bella's Syndrome, as I heard it's very contagious (I nearly got it myself).<br/><br/>What else? Oh, yeah, how could I forget! About one hour into the film we finally realize what the film was all about: turns out the main theme of this movie revolves around Bella's impossible pregnancy. Basically, Eddie takes Bella to a remote island to rape her with his frozen phallus (Bella obviously consents, because that's how she is, ya know). Now, if you're into vampire lore, you should know that a vampire's frozen penis cannot impregnate a woman's womb. Nevertheless, Bella gets pregnant anyway (go figure) and a giant ugly tumor grows inside her belly at exponential rate, endangering her frail little life unto death as the monstrous, hideous abomination grows within her stomach.<br/><br/>To make a long story short: baby is born, Bella dies. Lot of blood and guts. Wolf pack wants to kill baby. Vampire coven tries to protect baby. Bella is still dead. Jacob is heart-broken (and I kinda sympathize with the guy now). And Edward performs necrophilia on Bella's rotting corpse in an (almost futile) attempt to bring her back to life.<br/><br/>And then... *GASP!"" Bella comes back from the dead--REVAMPED! (no pun intended) <br/><br/>So the film ends on a cliffhanger. <br/><br/>How ingenious.<br/><br/>10 OUT OF 10 STARS!!<br/><br/>Things we learn from this film: <br/><br/>1. If ya gonna drink blood, better be O negative and you should sip it slowly with a straw from a Starbucks cup. <br/><br/>2. If it's a fetus, it's a baby. Quite possibly. (Thanks Jasper for your wise remark.) <br/><br/>3. A vampire's frozen phallus can actually impregnate constipated little girls. <br/><br/>4. Eddie has some serious homosexual inclinations (as we can see at the beginning of the movie when he tells Bella that there's something nasty she should know about him--then we're taken into a flashback where we are shown that given the choice between raping a lady or a gentleman, he'd always go for the latter). <br/><br/>5. Werewolves must need an ample repertoire of spare clothing, as every time they transform their clothes are ripped to shreds (I guess this is why they are often seen half-naked, with their manly chests exposed to the winds, wearing only a pair of lousy pants--not because they are an uncivilized tribe of Indians or whatever, but actually because they cannot afford the luxury of having their clothes torn apart every time they turn into wolves). <br/><br/>6. Brazil is carnival 24/7. No sleep, no work. Just party!<br/><br/>7. If you imprint on someone, that individual becomes your ""soulmate"" and nobody can harm him/her. This is a Werewolf's most Supreme Law!"
"bernardverna","1","26","51","18 November 2011"," You don't even have to see the movie to know what it's about
","It's the same movie all over again. The trailer was the only thing new, and that was basically the whole movie. Jacob takes off his shirt, with the same look on his face, the runs to Bella. Edward is basically a bad husband (And actor). Everyone thinks he just wants to protect Bella, but no, he just wants to control her. And Bella is the worst of them all, she's like a goth that can't act. This whole movie was just a bore, the trailer was the most action in the whole thing. I don't understand why people actually like this series. And my biggest thing about the movie is that, the were in the sun the whole time, but none of the vampires even minded. At least make one of them say ""Dang, it's hot out here"" or something. Plus, aren't they suppose to glisten when they are in the sun or something? Well guess what, that's a big flaw in the movie because they didn't. The biggest blood sucker of the series are the writers, because they managed to do the same movie in four different ways."
"Scrugulus","5","4","5","29 June 2012"," OK, but without much content
","There is not much happening altogether in this film. They put way too much focus on the wedding and the honeymoon, thus wasting precious time. But I guess all those teenage girl fans wanted a full portrayal of the big romantic wedding.<br/><br/>In all of the previous films, I liked the acting of most of the cast a lot. But in this film, everyone except Bella, Edward & Jacob is marginalised to such an extent that there cannot be much said about them. As an audience you just don't get to see enough of any of them to really develop a connection with or care about them.<br/><br/>Altogether this is an OK addition to the franchise, by no means worse than the disappointing/confusing 2nd or 3rd films. I assume I will give this film either a 5 or a 6 (out of 10), but I think I will withhold my final vote until I have seen part 2. I know some might say that they are released as separate films and therefore should be treated as such, but as the original book is ripped into two halves here, I think it is fair to reserve the final judgement until I have seen the two films in conjunction (seeing that, as I haven't read the books, I will need to have seen both films in order to make sense of it all)."
"ikickbutt505","2","21","40","18 November 2011"," Better book in the series, worst movie in the saga.
","If you liked the book, then stay clear of this movie! I wouldn't say that I am the biggest Twilight fan, but I appreciate and loved the books as well as the first couple movies. However, I was GREATLY disappointed with this rendition on the book, or what they would like to call a ""movie"".<br/><br/>First, the acting still sucks. Kristen Stewart still can't play anything besides awkward and strange. Robert Pattinson did a little better, but again he stuck to the awkward and uneasy character. Some people write that you ""could feel the love""; no what you felt was the urge to laugh hysterically when they were trying to be romantic or ""in love"". It kinda came off as a comedy because of all the cheesy lines and horrible acting skills.<br/><br/>Second, unlike the other movies, it did not follow the books AT ALL!!!!! They changed the major parts in the book, just to make the movie seem more interesting. I was looking forward to the friendship formed between Seth, Leah and Jacob and how they banded together as a separate wolf-pack to protect the Cullens. All I got was 2 seconds of Esme delivering food, and Leah stating how she didn't want to be the pathetic ex-girlfriend anymore. It did not go into ANYTHING (except for Jacob stating in the strange wolf mind fight) about Jacob being the true Alpha and how Jacob is the only one who can give permission for the treaty to be broken and how Edward has to ask him to do so in order to save Bella.<br/><br/>And what the hell was up with the Cullen, wolf fight towards the end of the movie? Horrible attempt to make the movie interesting, plus it NEVER HAPPENED IN THE BOOKS!!!! And the imprinting thing, not even explained so for those of you that have not read the books, be prepared to be confused about the glimpse into the future of Renesme and why the stupid fight ended.<br/><br/>It was one of the worst book to movie attempts that I have ever seen and I am highly disappointed that I paid $10 to see this movie. To be honest, I probably won't go to see the next one, until it comes out in the Redbox."

They have sex, there's a wedding, an offspring is born ad they wait for the apocalypse between the bloodsuckers and the wolves. Embarrassingly bad and ultra cheesy on all levels. Pitiful non acting by Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and the rest of the cast. Obviously designed for tween and teenage girls, even they were bored during the preview that I got to see for free. As you probably have guessed by now, I'm not a fan of this series. Like the last ""Harry Potter"", this ender will be done in two separate parts. Why bother? Everything in this film is overacted, the atmosphere looks like a trailer park, the music is probably the most mawkish ever committed to celluloid , and the whole production in general looks like one of those Mexican made velvet paintings with a wolf sitting in frot of a full moon. Does absolutely nothing to advance series that should have ended at part one, it was designed to lure the target audience girls into the multiplexes to spend the hard earned money that mommy and daddy have to work two jobs to give them. Before my review gets pulled for ""abuse"", heed my warning. Do NOT pay money to see this film. It literally stinks. You can almost see the cloud of its foul stench rising from the screen.

","From the moment that Jacob freaks when he receives Bella's wedding invitation, to the very last frame of 'Breaking Dawn', the 5 star film is like a magnificent tasty feast that you won't want to ever end. Breaking Dawn fans–you will NOT be disappointed. Director Bill Condon has worked hard to capture the breadth of the action and emotion in Stephanie Meyer's last Twilight novel.<br/><br/>Thank goodness, the powers-to-be at Summit Entertainment which produces the Twilight series, made the decision to break Breaking Dawn into two films. There's no way you could have packed all the action in the last book into one movie.<br/><br/>Even so, Breaking Dawn Part I could have been 15 or 20 minutes longer, to my mind, to have had enough time to luxuriously dwell on all the significant moments and life events that it covers.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart perfectly captures Bella's apprehension as she's about to walk down the aisle at her wedding. And the wedding scene is so lush, romantic and heartfelt as Edward and Bella whisper their vows–I just wanted it to go on and on and on.<br/><br/>Now–the gown. It will not be a letdown. I don't want to reveal too much but it manages to be very Bella–not overdone–and yet it is stunningly and elegantly fitted (Kristen has said that it was tight), with elegantly figure-highlighting details.<br/><br/>Will Bella's gown be as widely copied as Kate Middleton's? It will come close. It's design will certainly flatter many young women.<br/><br/>But back to the lavishly romantic wedding–creatively designed by Alice Cullen. My only criticism is that we all could have spent even more time at that wedding, honing in on meeting the visiting vampire contingents, checking in with Bella and Edward's baffled schoolmates and on Bella's nervous parents.<br/><br/>Then Bella and Edward take us along on the honeymoon that is every bit as exotic and luxurious as Stephenie Meyer paints it. Is the highly written about and hotly discussed sex scene as erotic as Robert Pattinson has told us it would be ?<br/><br/>I'll leave it to you to decide but there's no question about the sizzling sexual tension and chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. The two are always totally believable as the star-crossed lovers who pledge to be together for eternity.<br/><br/>What you'll probably be surprised by is the unexpected humor that pops up from time to time in this epic film. And we get some of it endearingly during Bella and Edward's Brazilian honeymoon heaven.<br/><br/>But it's when Bella's pregnancy kicks in (literally) that the film really takes off. That's because Jacob a.k.a. Taylor Lautner comes back into the picture along with all his tortured love triangle tension.<br/><br/>Other ""film"" critics – boo on you – I don't agree with the fine cinematic reviewers who deride Taylor as just a fabulous chest, strong jaw, and handsome face.<br/><br/>Yes, he is all those but his character–a 16-year-old young man/wolf struggling to adjust to his werewolf fate – isn't supposed to be a chatty self-expressive New York dude like Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>No, he's supposed to be a tongue-tied semi-lost soul who loves Bella like a soul mate, and doesn't know how to express himself most of the time, except for physically. Not too unlike many 16-year-old boys.<br/><br/>But once Bella and Edward are back from their honeymoon and she is clinging to life while trying to gestate her baby, the tension is intense.<br/><br/>Tension between Bella and Edward, Bella and Jacob, and Jacob and the entire wolf pack.<br/><br/>A lot of attention has been paid to Bella's wedding hair and makeup but Bella as a vampire mama is a pretty intense makeup job itself . And acting job.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart, to her credit, is completely believable as a weak Bella desperately holding on to life for the love of her baby.<br/><br/>As promised – the birth scene is wild, shocking, and yes, quite bloody.<br/><br/>And there's no way that any Twi-hard isn't going to be left desperately wanting to see Breaking Dawn Part 2.<br/><br/>But let me tell you – stick around for the credits. There's a surprise last scene. There's also a wedding surprise bonus that I won't detail, but you will go WILD!<br/><br/>My only real criticism is that I wanted more werewolves. We don't watching the film, get as deep an understanding of the communication, hierarchy, and pack lives of the wolves. Neither do we understand enough why Bella's pregnancy becomes such a HUGE issue for the pack.<br/><br/>Every fan who has read the books will know what is going on and I understand Bill Condon's need for shorthand on the wolves–something had to go. But the wolves created for the screen are so magnificent and mysterious–I wanted to see them more and have their behavior and history explained. Maybe Condon will get to that in Breaking Dawn Part 2.<br/><br/>So Twi-fans–snap up your tickets and head to the theaters–there's no way you won't want to see this film more than onceor twice! I do!<br/><br/>Hollywoodlife by bonnie"
"TourettesPersonal","4","19","36","18 November 2011"," Bland To Shallowness
","I never liked Twilight films but I still have faith to their upcoming movies. Unfortunately this is the second to the last Twilight movie. Breaking Dawn Part 1 still has the same problems. Blandness and dullness. Breaking Dawn has its darkness to its plot but it was executed differently. It has its intensity but mostly it's like a joke. The film is also too long. It feel longer than any two hour blockbuster we get this year. But at least this movie gave die hard Edward Cullen fans a lesson. Vampire Sex Is Deadly.<br/><br/>The story is all about the danger of Bella's pregnancy. But the whole plot happens in the near end of the film. The whole first act feels tedious. The movie spends most of the time to Bella and Edward's honeymoon and their never ending sex. This film could've been intriguing. But it saves too much to the last part of the story. The acting also remains the same with their dull and bland personalities. The fun only occurs in the very short scene of Michael Sheen in the mid credits.<br/><br/>The filmmaking isn't really the problem of this series. The cinematography is indeed decent. The score always fits to this series. The production design and the special effects are obviously well made. However the directors are trying to fit their style to the story. The directing here is probably decent but the grim dark moments ends up looking shallow and some of it is ludicrous.<br/><br/>This is just the first half of the story. The next film will reveal all the questions asked in this film but this wasted 117 minutes for asking those questions. Then again, it's just another Twilight film with tedious long runtime, dullness and blandness, and any other nonsense. This film had potential by its intriguing plot but we've been cheated by splitting the story in half. I don't think it's necessary to split this book in half. Only Twilight fans will appreciate this."
"moviexclusive","Null","43","92","8 November 2011"," The most romantic and emotionally thrilling chapter by far, 'Breaking Dawn- Part I' is also the best in the series
","Following in the footsteps of the most successful print-to-screen franchise that recently concluded an epic journey lasting a decade, this adaptation of the final book in author Stephanie Meyer's groundbreaking 'Twilight' series has been split into two parts- and no matter your cynical views of it being no more than a cash-grab attempt by studio executives, the decision to do so is ultimately an inspired one. <br/><br/>Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg makes the split right where it belongs- and this first-parter deals with Bella's marriage to Edward, their subsequent honeymoon, her treacherous pregnancy and her transformation. Fans- to be specific, Team Edward fans- however will be rewarded immediately with the long-awaited moment in the entire saga. It is also a most beautiful one, as Edward and Bella finally seal their love with each other with the covenant of marriage. An entire half hour of the movie is dedicated to their wedding, and director Bill Condon stages the occasion resplendently. More than just elaborate sets, Condon draws out its poignancy through his key characters- the single father Charlie (Billy Burke) entrusting his beloved daughter to Edward; the bride Bella excited yet nervous to begin a new chapter of her life and her love with a vampire; and the bridegroom Edward overjoyed to be married to Bella yet uneasy that their human-vampire nuptials will hurt her. <br/><br/>At the centre of it is Bella and Edward's immense love for each other, and a scene where the pair exchange their vows looking into each other's eyes and oblivious to the crowd in front of them is deeply touching. Just as this instalment finally gives Bella and Edward their happily- ever-after, it also gives closure to Jacob's love for Bella- and Team Jacob fans will relish a slow dance between the two away from the wedding party as Jacob finally comes to terms as best as he can that Bella is not his to have. <br/><br/>It's clear from how Condon films the 'wedding of the century' that he possesses surprising sensitivity for the material and that acumen is especially important especially towards the second half of the film. Those who have read the books will know that this final chapter is the most challenging to film of all the four, particularly because it deals with themes like sacrifice, betrayal and death. And leading up to that is the newly married Cullens' honeymoon in Isle Esme, off the coast of Brazil's Rio de Janeiro where, Bella and Edward consummate their marriage- their lovemaking scenes filmed as passionately as would be allowed under a PG13 rating. <br/><br/>Bella's consequent pregnancy sets off a chain of events that, in the hands of a lesser director, could very well descend into farce- thankfully then, this movie has found a masterful helmsman in Condon. He conveys fully the gravity and the severity of the decisions facing the triumvirate- at the core, Bella, whose determination to keep her unprecedented child is literally tearing her apart from inside; on one end, Edward, the father, distraught that his actions could have caused so much pain to the one he so loves; and on the other, Jacob, forced to choose between loyalty and love as his Alpha, Sam (Chaske Spencer), makes clear his intent to destroy the human-vampire creation in Bella.<br/><br/>There is also a newfound urgency to the film permeated with an air of nervous anticipation, brought about by the unforeseen date of Bella's delivery given the child's unusually accelerated growth. Never has any of the previous 'Twilight' films been as pacey, and gone are the chunks of unwieldy exposition that have often leadened its predecessors, substituted with brevity and punch in both dialogue and action. Condon also skilfully tackles the trickier aspects of the film- in particular, Bella's excruciating childbirth through soft dissolves and closeups. Indeed, Condon has made a film that is gripping, a quality that many would agree none of the earlier films are associated with.<br/><br/>That this instalment is so mesmerising is also thanks to Kristen Stewart, who makes Bella's every emotion keenly felt that runs the gamut from joy, trepidation, anxiety, distress and above all quiet and resolute determination. Robert Pattinson has arguably less to do here, but his earlier scenes with Stewart have a sparkling chemistry that effortlessly expresses the attraction between their characters (and of course, the real-life couple). As for Lautner, save for an opening scene that sees him running off into the woods upon receiving Bella and Edward's wedding invitation, the actor gets to act with his shirt on but (and we're sorry to disappoint his fans) is largely forgettable doing his usual intense brooding routine that's grown all too familiar from the last three films.<br/><br/>With 'Breaking Dawn', Condon has taken the 'Twilight' franchise in a new and exciting direction, moving away from the inter-species love rivalry that has characterised the film series so far. It's about time Bella, Edward and Jacob grew up, so it's gratifying to see that they are here dealing with more mature and therefore more complex ramifications arising from their human-vampire marriage union. <br/><br/>Not only then has 'Twilight' decided to go out the way 'Harry Potter' did in two parts, but it is also doing so the way the 'Potter' films have- with every successive instalment better than the last, and 'Breaking Dawn' marks the best in the series. Easily the most emotionally satisfying of any of the films so far, it also ends on a thrilling high, leaving you with bated breath for the concluding film due one year later."

","I have the worst tendency to not sit still and read, so I listened to the audio version of this book. I thought the character imitations were dreadful, but patiently waited for the movie to see what they would make of it. They skipped like 90% of the book, and what they did follow SUCKED. The dramatic parts were so dramatically cheesy the entire theater was laughing, and it was all jumbled together so badly that it didn't even make any sense. If I hadn't read the book, I would have been so confused. However, since I did ""read"" the book, I'm offended they call this the first installment of the book, because its nothing like it. Its really every actor/ress's worst attempt at Twilight yet, and I can't believe that I spent my hard earned money on this. Most horrible movie yet, and I'm a damn good fan, but this was just....no words but...disappointment. The only good part of the movie, was the ending. I'm really hoping that they redeem themselves in the next chapter. I wouldn't spend any money on this; even at the dollar theater. Its THAT bad. Any Twilight fan that defends the lack of integrity of this movie truly has a mental issue, or bad taste in movies because it was just BAD."

","THERE ARE NO SPOILERS Compared to the first three movies (which I did not extremely like either), this movie is the worst in the series. It may follow the main plot of the book, but the most important details are left out. Much of the plot completely disappears throughout the movie. If you have read the books before, you will consider this movie a major disappointment that will ruin your idea of the Twilight series. Even though the acting is somewhat good, I think Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson could have done much better. Much of the acting was very fake and most of the movie left a sore thought in my head. Many of the scenes were poorly written and the whole movie was basically very repetitive. In the movie, the main focus of the two lovers is lost and they overuse kisses and other things that I won't go into detail. I know already that many of you will dislike me for comparing this to Harry Potter but I feel the need to. Harry Potter, although also released almost annually, has followed the books in detail even though some of the plot usually had to be cut out due to length issues. I feel that the acting in Harry Potter is always very superb compared to the poor jobs done in this movie. Overall, I do not recommend this movie unless you are a very very hardcore Twilight fan and you must see all the movies immediately. If you are just an in between, I suggest waiting to rent or buy it on DVD/Blu-Ray."

","This movie is the best comedy of the year.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner's shirt comes off in the first scene of the movie. Bella has the dumbest dreams. Charlie is the most likable character, mainly because he is the only one intentionally providing comic relief. After the wedding, there is a drawn out road trip sequence, and then, there is a really bizarre 30 minute long soft core porn montage. Robert Pattinson, luckily, has begun to openly mock the series, which allows me to appreciate his poorly delivered lines all the more. I think I'll allow it, considering the drivel he's been given as dialogue.<br/><br/>This movie is indeed the most entertaining of the saga, at certain parts, but all the parts in between are the longest, most poorly written, pointless scenes ever stapled together to make a film. In the other three films, I could get through all the scenes without looking for a fast forward button, in this one, however, I found myself looking to my comrades and waving the movie along as if it were a long winded distant relative on the phone.<br/><br/>There are some real highlights, and I left the theater in tears from laughing so hard. Very rarely does a movie bring me to tears, even in laughter. Breaking Dawn brought me to tears over and over again."

And let's be honest, the movie is boring for some people but then if you realized, Stephanie Meyer didn't exactly put in much action in the book either so yeah. i thought it was pretty good for a clichéd movie and i was entertained. a good movie to watch on a lazy day.. so what if it's cliché? many other movies are clichéd as well.that didn't stop people for rating other clichéd movies better than it is.Don't be prejudiced against this movie."
"TinklePrincess","1","10","17","19 November 2011"," Terrible! Ruined the entire Twilight franchise!
","First, let me just say that I loved the books – they weren't written particularly well but I enjoyed reading them – I think it's a good concept.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first three movies, too, if I'm honest. New Moon wasn't a favourite but that's because I'm firmly NOT Team Jacob – not particularly Team Edward either, but I just don't like Jacob, he's a sleaze and forces himself onto Bella. I also think that Taylor Lautner over-enunciates and although he's getting slightly better, not the best actor. On that note, I think that the way he speaks isn't realistic – although that's down to Stephanie Meyer, the script is lifted right out of the books and she writes like a teenager, you can certainly tell she's not a professional writer – people just don't talk like that in real life! The casting wasn't very good from the start, I don't really rate any of the main actors. Robert Pattinson plays Edward in a way which is difficult to watch. I know that he was meant to be slightly pained in the first movie, due to his confusion over Bella, but it doesn't really fit anymore. He looks wooden and in pain, too much like Jasper (who I think it suits very well!) Kristen is getting better, and prettier, but I think she's very wooden too. I think that as the audience, we are meant to be able to connect with the main characters, and I don't feel that we do.<br/><br/>Anyway on to the movie The best bits, in my humble opinion, were the close-ups of the dress. Carolina Herrera did really well there. I wasn't a fan of the front – a bit like a leotard – but the back was exquisite! I also liked the very normal way that Bella and Edward just spent time playing chess and such on their honeymoon – I know it was symbolic and a bit of a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that they were't having sex so they sat playing chess (boring?), blah, blah The dream wedding was just obvious and amateur, we knew as soon as it began that it was a dream and it looked as though it had just been picked from a school-kid's movie project! The wolf ""conversation"" was like a scene from the Power Rangers or Spyro the Dragon Great if it was a kid's movie but I think in this, it was just terrible The venom going through the body, encasing the veins and heart etc, that was just strange and seemed a bit irrelevant – they could have done so much with the adaptation but they copped out with all the CGI! I personally don't think it needed to be split into two movies they just wanted to do a Harry Potter and get more money There were too many flashbacks and dream/subconscious sequences, almost as if they didn't actually have enough storyline to fill the time All in all, I was sorely disappointed – I had been excited to see it and I felt that it had so much promise – they could have done anything, but they didn't.<br/><br/>I hope they bring back Catherine Hardwicke or David Slade as director. Bill Condon ruined the movie and might have even ruined the Twilight brand! It didn't seem to fit with the others. The end credits too, they were atrocious! They seemed distinctly Tarantino-esque, almost comic book like, which lowered the tone quite significantly.<br/><br/>Will I still go to see the next one? Yes, unfortunately, because although I don't want to put any more money into the franchise, I have to see it end.<br/><br/>I guess we'll just have to wait and see and hope it gets better!"

","it is a cruel word but that is truth. because the seduction from the first parts is lost, the acting becomes more and more a sketch, the love story is unrealistic, the work of team has wrong map. basic problem - the large possibilities for make a decent film who are ignored. result, the charm of fights, the dramatic fight for young lady heart - this film confirms Jacob was the best choice and the option of writer/ scriptwriter was not inspired - are parts of past for a fake exercise of family crisis and few drops of Brasil.the problem is not that errors but the impression than Breaking Dawn 1 is the expected movie for teenagers. a fake movie. and that is all."

","So I've seen all of them... not sure why but I did enjoy the first one. From there it was mostly downhill, except the last was OK too. #2 and #3 we OK, but lacked the verve the first one had... the imagination. After that it's just a cat and dog fight amongst the adversaries. Rosenberg has written the screenplay for all of them and except for the first has shown little true talent. The plots are pedestrian and hackneyed for the most part--- passing for fair daytime soaps, barely. But I like the cast; several have good acting skills. But Dawn One reminded me of the old Star Trek series when the actors all get together on the enterprise and sit around staring at each other wondering when the plot is going to start. But she's got millions of suckers, who fall for this stuff. Most of the movies have grossed about $300M on budgets of $100M or less. Imagine what they could have done with a talented writer!"

"MercurioKnight","2","5","7","29 February 2012"," The ingredients aren't necessarily bad in this series, it's just the filmmakers who are inept. I'm still amused, though.
","Let me preface by saying I enjoy all kinds of films, including 'chick flicks'.<br/><br/>Let's start by going into what this film teaches us, the audience, and the millions of teen fans... that our demure, virginal leading lady's aspirations lie not in getting a good job, or going to college, or anything of the sort. Instead, to get married to the undead prince charming, and have a child (which, according to the film, is unheard of in the vampire realm. Though, of course, many other stories have had such offspring before.). That is about the extent of this movie (the first half is the marriage and the honeymoon, then the second half deals with the pregnancy). <br/><br/>They attempt to give the 'revelations' of this story some gravitas, but fail to on a writing and an acting level. For example, Jacob exclaims something along the lines of doing that he must, regardless of sacrifice... but instead of this dramatic moment playing as let's build respect for this character, it had me chuckling. It is funny to watch these dark, morose, angst ridden characters, and it shouldn't be. Nothing that this film attempts to say is important feels all that important.<br/><br/>The continual grrrr back and forth between Jacob and the leading vampire guy (I always called him flatface, my affectionate pet name for him) is supposed to create some kind of tension, I guess... Jacob more often than not just comes off as a jerk. Flatface is just the 'I have so much internal pain, look at me emote' kind of guy. The one good thing in this chapter is the werewolf vs vampire battle was slightly better than the last one (I might be remembering incorrectly, I just remember the last one having an oh so dreadful battle), but we're still faced with pretty mediocre werewolf vs vampire action. Not as bad as the first Underworld, but I kept expecting flatface to call out 'Judokick' when he kicked a werewolf back, in Austin Powers fashion.<br/><br/>For a second, I wondered what Joss Whedon would do if given such a story, and then I remembered, he did have such a story during his run of Angel, except it was two vampires... but the importance and drama of that storyline made for eager watching. I felt sympathy for Darla, as the little baby's soul gave her a conscious and that was ripping her up. Partly due to top notch acting, partly due to wonderful writing. In fact, just about everything in the minimalist plot of the twilight films has been done in the scope of the Buffy and Angel TV series'.<br/><br/>Anne Rice practically invented the morose, Gothic vampire (look at Interview with a Vampire. Again, the gravitas of the situation and the drama has a punch to it, bittersweet. There is a haunting beauty to the scene where Brad Pitt's character finds the remains of his 'turned' daughter and caretaker, watching them break apart to dust... It's sad, tragic.)<br/><br/>That's what the Twilight series needed. A director who could lend a visual poetry to the film and get the performances out of his/her actors needed to convey that, a screenwriter that didn't seem like he/she was about as old and inexperienced as some of the characters he/she is writing, and actors who can convey that depth and deepness. Without that, you get the series as it stands currently. A fangless vampire, without the ability to bite, without substance, and more coming off as amusing than anything. A film doesn't have to be original to work (as there are very few original works anymore), it just has to exemplify its elements in the best possible way.<br/><br/>If these films didn't amuse me so much, I wouldn't even bother. What saddens me is that these many teen fans are eating this up and they're thinking this is good. It has many bad lessons to teach and it is pretty half assed in comparison to what has come before. And the fact that this has been successful? How many knock offs will we see next? I'm surprised there haven't been more knock offs of LOTR and Harry Potter than there have been... (though I know they've been trying to start the first book in many different book series to find a hit so they can make the rest of the books).<br/><br/>So, I am torn. On the one hand, I'm amused and entertained by how bad this series is. On the other, the ingredients of the story aren't necessarily bad. They just don't have the right filmmakers that can make these ingredients translate. Oh well, it is a little bit late for that."

","Finally that dead/undead duo of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have finally tied the knot though Stewart's father is not ecstatic over her choice of life or after life partner if you will. Why couldn't his beautiful daughter marry a nice doctor?<br/><br/>Pattinson and Stewart honeymoon in Rio DeJaniero and that's certainly one of the most romantic spots on the globe. And Stewart is in a family way. But giving birth to a vampire is difficult indeed and there are no vampire obstetricians apparently.<br/><br/>Taylor Lautner as the Indian wolf prince of his tribe is still the odd man out in the triangle. Poor kid, personally I'd have taken him before Pattinson. The possible birth of the Pattinson/Stewart child is held as a threat to his people so Lautner has some critical choices to make. Do you doubt where he's going to come down?<br/><br/>These two seem to be having a romantic triangle that rivals Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot. But those who follow the Twilight novel series know what's coming up and it's not quite the same as Malory.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part I is the weakest so far of the Twilight films I've seen, but it does set the stage for what is to follow."

","Up front I will say that I am a huge fan of the Twilight Saga. Breaking Dawn being the last and IMO the best of the books in the series. I have read the book 6 times so far and will be reading it again.<br/><br/>While the film follows the book reasonably closely I was disappointed with some of the license that was taken with the adaption. The most disappointing were the fight scenes between the vampires and the wolves, anyone who has read the book will know exactly what I mean. No further needs to be said here.<br/><br/>The acting that has been remarked on by other reviewers in this was no different to any of the previous movies in the series as far as I was concerned and I was happy with most of the movie. People who remarked on the woodenness of the acting do not seem to take into account way Edward reacted towards Bella in the book and I was not overly concerned with it at all. The only things that brought the movie down for me were the changes that were made to the story, these spoiled the movie for me.<br/><br/>The movie ended at the point that I expected it to end and I look forward to the next and last installment. I only hope they do not change too much from the book, as I believe the next part is the best of the lot.<br/><br/>Grudging 5 out of 10 for me. I would have given it a 6.5-7 but for the changes that messed up the movie."

","Can't really say much that others haven't. Twihards will go no matter what to see this movie, but non twihards should wait until the next one comes out to watch them back to back. It's okay to wait. You won't miss anything if you do, as this movie is so boring that they never should have cut it into 2 movies to make the BILLIONS that Summit wants to make from BD.<br/><br/>Part one of breaking dawn didn't really have anything. I mean if you haven't had sex before then I guess you'll be into the total G sex scene, but if you have had sex before you will laugh until you pee your pants.<br/><br/>Acting is better, but it's still bad so take that for what it is. Thank you to the person who sent Ms. Greene to acting class, and made sure she showed up!! Ms. Stewart still needs help in the acting field. She has that horrible problem of allowing viewers to see her rehearse her lines in her head before saying them on the screen. It's distracting. Mr. Patterson seemed amused throughout the whole movie like he couldn't believe the words coming out of his mouth either. THE BOOK DIALOGUE IS JUST NOT THERE PEOPLE.<br/><br/>They changed parts of the story for the movie. Pretty much everything w/ the wolves was rewritten a bit or twisted so that it is not really enjoyable to watch. Even what the going ons at the island were altered enough from the book to annoy me. Interactions I was looking forward to between the characters didn't happen, even though they were small interactions I would have loved to see them. Like the intro of BD where the boys got Bella the ""before car"". It showed their sense of humor as well as the love.<br/><br/>After viewing Part One of Breaking Dawn, I feel that it is a cinema failure because it should not have been broken into 2 movies. The ""cliffhanger"" didn't leave me salivating for Part 2, just more thinking that they're so gonna rewrite the story just to put more battle scenes to satisfy people who already don't like the story and think it's boring.<br/><br/>Honestly the first twilight was the best. Maybe it was the mystical feel in the filming, but these sequels are too much glitter and not enough soul.<br/><br/>The books aren't literature, and the movies aren't blockbuster worthy, but they are an escape from reality for a short time. I only wish that executives and Meyers took more pride in their projects instead of letting them become so shallow.<br/><br/>S. Meyers thinks there is a backlash on her books and movies because of all the publicity and hype. In a way she is correct. The backlash comes from people who read her saga, then read other series with the same subject. After reading other series such as the Vampire Academy, her fans have realized that Meyers writing is indeed elementary, and other authors have written better books, but without the publicity she has received."

","A few months ago I had the pleasure of enduring four hours sequestered in a small concrete room with a couple hundred young women. This isn't the start of an autobiography of Hugh Hefner, but how a male observes the Twilight phenomenon. You get to the theatre early, your ears bleed from shouts of ""Team Jacob,"" and then your brain is numbed. <br/><br/>Genuine shock. That's the best way to describe my state of being after The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, the movie from the aforementioned events. It's a movie that panders sex to tweenage girls and their all-about-me mentality that will undoubtedly enforce an unrealistic notion that the perfect man will slave over them, but somehow it's not half bad.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the next installment, Breaking Dawn - Part 1, the fourth in a film series that only began in late 2008. The movie starts as friends and family of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) receive invitations to her wedding to Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Within 10 minutes they are married and somewhere between there and Bella's coming to terms with the consequences of being a woman carrying a vampire baby are a number of music montages, a laughable scene where wolves chat about tribal dominance, and a wolf vs vampire skirmish of no consequence. <br/><br/>The Twilight Saga hasn't ever been known for Oscar worthy performances, but what somehow made it past editing in this particular film defies belief. The words and mannerisms on display are over the top for a movie trying so hard to take its subject seriously, but people do not behave like Kristen Stewart. Maybe Bella is actually a zombie.<br/><br/>It's theft to spread a bookend across multiple films. By chopping this story, just as with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, there is a sense of buildup that leads to nowhere within a single movie. Of course the point behind this is to tell fans of the novel that the entire novel will be see on screen, when the actual reasoning is to put another can under old Betsy. Unless something drastic happens this tactic will become the new norm. <br/><br/>Last week I reviewed what could go down as the worst comedy of all time (Jack and Jill). This week I had to review what could be the worst movie to ever feature vampires and/or werewolves. I say had because the shame of it is that this movie will makes hundreds of millions of dollars on it's carefully plotted trek into the psyches and allowances of young girls.

","First, I LOVE Twilight series, but this was such a disappointment. It seemed like the director relied too heavily on the actor's stardom, their chemistry, gory scenes, and the greatly anticipated wedding (which was almost NOTHING like the book). The movie just felt so 'diluted.' It could've been one of the best movies of the series, but it was quite dull and unconvincing.<br/><br/>One trivial aspect that was just simply distracting is the difference in Edward's hair. Although it's more true to the book, it's not anything like the first 3 movies, and the color looked 'flat/dull' on the big screen.)<br/><br/>WARNING: Spoilers below... Acting overall was just awful this time around. Important things like Edward's grief at seeing Bella so weak were barely portrayed, and he came across as distant and angry, not torn and desperate as in the book - as if he's in his own personal hell! Miss Stewart's face was almost blank and lifeless most of the film. Yet, the director chose closeups for her in MANY scenes, and her acting ability just wasn't up to the task of conveying any range of emotions. In fact, multiple times if I hadn't read the book I'd have no clue what she was feeling! What's worse is the lack of substantive dialogue in the movie, which is Meyer's strength. So on screen the acting had to be stellar, but was lack- luster. Better dialogue/screen writing would've helped greatly to mask the lack of emotional dynamics. They left out so many conversations, and their dialogue wasn't quite true to the characters. Many details are left out, so many that the story doesn't seem to hold together. <br/><br/>And don't get me started on my frustrations of the pack-splitting scene. The wolves voices were so fake sounding and overly dramatic compared to the rest of the movie's tone."

I knew when i was coming but for some reason they seemed to drag it on a bit. It kinda felt like they were just trying to fill the movie time. Do i believe that this book could have been done in one movie yes.<br/><br/>So after the movie was done we were walking around the mall that we had just seen it and overheard two girls that were clearly twi-hard complaining hard core about much they hated it and now be warned here come some spoilers.<br/><br/>They hated the part about the wolves fight scene with the cullens and how the wolves moved so fast that it didn't look so real. OK people you have to remember in CG, animation is made fast to cover any animated mistakes that could not be fixed. I thought it was pretty good CGI for what it was. Also keep in mind it summit entertainment twilight is there biggest grossing movie ever for this company.<br/><br/>So i wont ruin anything else for this movie but if you go in with really low expectations then you come out thinking it was better then you thought. If you had really high expectations well then your screwed."
"t-hunt910","3","7","11","22 November 2011"," Twilight franchise still not working after the forth attempt.
","Having been dragged to cinema by other half to see all the other films in the Twilight series, I still have major problems. Breaking dawn part 1 still is full of embarrassing dialogue which at times is unintentionally laughable. The wedding sequence in this film is particular guilty in this respect. The much hyped sex scene with Edward breaking the bed in the throes of passion with Bella made the majority of the audience laugh. The director Bill Condon appears to have being studying carry on films to much. The werwolf's in the film do not fare much better. The sequence where they communicate with each other with out moving their lips is just annoying. The only part of the movie that works is when Bella finally turns into a vampire which is mainly due to excellent use of CGI. The only other effective sequence is Bellas wedding nightmare. Additionally the film is seriously compromised by its 12a certificate. The birth and sex scene etc. should have much stronger and more explicit for the film to have real dramatic impact. In terms of reviewing the film,in reality there are two types of movie goers in the world, those who love twilight and those who don't. The twilight believers will never accept any forms of criticism about their beloved franchise . In view of this the movie should be avoided at all costs except for twilight die hards. For husbands and other half's dragged to the flicks, it least the film is just about tolerable."

","The Twilight Saga [4.1]: Breaking Dawn Part 1 (1:57, PG-13) — fantasy: supernatural, biggie, sequel, OSIT romantics<br/><br/>My friend Hope says ""I'll see Twilight the way it was meant to be seen: with a teenaged girl."" Good advice, because there's not much here for anyone else.<br/><br/>Box Office Mojo estimates that Summit Entertainment and director Bill Condon threw $110 million at this project, but it's virtually impossible to tell where it went. Not to the location shots in Rio de Janeiro, which Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella nee Swan (Kristen Stewart) pass thru, VERY briefly, on the way to their own private island for their honeymoon. Not for the single other location used for the rest of the movie, the Cullens' snazzy but completely isolated 3-story house in the woods of the Pacific northwest. Not for the outdoor wedding under the trees. Not, based on total lines of dialog, on the large supporting cast. Not on the minimal special effects, which mainly consist of shadowy shots of fast-moving werewolves and close-ups of metamorphosing corpuscles that could have been lifted straight from 1966's Fantastic Voyage.<br/><br/>And certainly not on the screenplay (by Melissa Rosenberg, based on the hyper-best-selling novels by Stephenie Meyer).<br/><br/>I'm guessing the big bux may have gone into either make-up or CGI for Stewart, who couldn't possibly have undergone in real life the transformation into the emaciated, hollow-eyed Dachau casualty shown on screen, victim of what can charitably be called a ""problem pregnancy"" that runs its course in less than 2 months after the, um, rambunctious wedding night she spends with her attentive but enthusiastic new groom.<br/><br/>This is a movie that tries to have it all possible ways with the moral issues. No sex until after marriage (and not a lot even then, either, it seems), and it's swell that the woman enjoys it, but the guy should remain dubious. Respect a woman's decision about what to do with her own body when it comes to abortion, but for heaven's sake don't encourage the practice, because fersher things will always turn out all right in the end. Use vigilante justice as long as the people you're dispatching are themselves potential killers and you feel real bad about it decades later. Do take advantage of friendship and hospitality (that would be Taylor Lautner as Jacob, hanging with his new vampire allies), but feel free to throw around a few death threats at your hosts, because hey, what are friends for, after all? Insist on the letter of the law, no matter how much blood has to be spilled as a result, but remember that a higher law can always trump a lesser one.<br/><br/>Considering that our heroine has spent 3 entire movies looking forward to her wedding day, it's perplexing that she seemed to be the grimmest, glummest bride in any movie not made in Iran. And the awkward turns that each of her friends got at the microphone during the reception were just embarrassing all around. It's hard to believe that Rosenberg actually got paid for this. Only Lautner gets a few good lines, but they're delivered at wildly inappropriate moments.<br/><br/>Mainly, the movie just drags. It appears that none of the characters have any lives at all outside of wondering how Bella is or what she's doing at this very moment. Even when she's right there in the room with them, they can think of nothing better to do than just stand around looking at her.<br/><br/>There are 2 kind of interesting things that happen at the end, but by then you've sat thru 1:45 worth of the kind of pacing, dialog, first-name overusage, improbably well-kempt people, heavy breathing, and extreme close-ups that even TV soap operas can't sustain any more.<br/><br/>It'll probably make its production costs back by Sunday."

Very different and funny! Billy Burke, who plays Bella's dad, Charlie has some funny lines by making fun of his ex-wife, Renee. Before I go on , I will be exposing *SPOILERS* in this review. But, not many because I do want you to spend your money and go see this movie. Haha. So anyways, there is a wedding; SO BEAUTIFUL,and a pregnancy; Warning: sort of gruesome since it's a vampire fang C-section. Again, I don't want to spoil it for any of you so I won't go on. But, in the end this movie is absolutely FANTASTIC!! If you haven't seen the other movies, then don't even bother because you will be confused the whole movie.

","...(Shaking head, muttering)... It's definitely not as bad as some reviewers say it is, but it's no magical masterpiece.<br/><br/>I'm now reflecting on the impossibly gooey cheese that is Breaking Dawn. It begs you to cringe with over-the-top theatrics, uncomfortable pauses, and more awkward moments than all the other Twilight films combined. You'll find yourself cringing and/or laughing hysterically at times. The film tries hard to evoke emotion from its audience, too hard. Try too hard at something, and you're bound to look silly. I do not blame the actors for this, It falls squarely upon the writer. In fact, it might not be praise, but the acting is significantly better in this film than the others in this saga. <br/><br/>Some people thrive on that feeling and love the falsetto version of cheesy drama. They're the people who subscribe to Soap Digest and have their Tivo's programmed to record their beloved Soap everyday. The further the Twilight saga progresses, the more it embraces the type of audience I just described, and alienates the rest of us.<br/><br/>The story is so bizarre and illogical at times, it crosses the line from the fantasy-Romance genre into bad Sci-Fi type storytelling. That's a shame. But at least the movie still moves along telling its story...albeit slowly.<br/><br/>Poor Jacob. The humiliation the poor guy is forced to suffer never ends! He must be a dedicated masochist. However, the emotional torment he continuously endures is rivaled by the physical pain Bella suffers in this film. She is put through the ringer, but you can't really feel sorry for her. She continues the tradition of making the men in her life agonize.<br/><br/>I did enjoy some of the scenery in the film, the sets are very appealing and appropriate for the story, it maintains a good atmosphere. The musical score is also appropriate, not distracting, it does what it's meant to do.<br/><br/>The Robot-like voices in the wolf argument scene are hardly comprehensible. I've had more success translating Korean rap songs. I could have stood for a more in-depth look into the wolf packs world, and seen more action from them. But alas, very little material concerning the pack is presented. The film is strongly fixated on Bella and Edwards ordeal.<br/><br/>For the Twi-hards: you wont regret going to the theater and shelling out the cash to see this one. For others, with milder interest in the Twilight franchise, you'd be equally as pleased just to wait for the DVD."

The acting is bad, the sound design is bad, the CGI is bad the plot is inconsitant filler, there are too many flashbacks and dream sequences. Nothing in these movies is explained.

"HelenMary","5","2","2","20 May 2013"," the climax wedding and honeymoon portion of the franchise romance
","The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD). <br/><br/>The first half of final book, which I believe shouldn't have been split into two halves as there isn't enough to spread out to four plus hours so consequently both films are riddled with montages and scenes that don't really move the story on; especially the honeymoon and all the chess games for example. The broken up bedroom after their wedding night is funny, and I like the Director didn't shy away from scenes with skin in them in order to keep it for younger audiences given the basic naivety of the majority of the rest of the films. It's a nice film, the wedding very sweet, and all the preparations lovely but again it's the interaction with the Quileutes and the vampire clan that are best. This gets interesting when Bella gets pregnant at super speed and the pregnancy causes a lot of issues including twitchy wolves and scary Volturi. Anything with the Volturi bring an added dimension to the story but they're all a little cheesy and camp rather than scary. Whilst Martin Sheen is a great actor, the fear factor works better on the page than on the screen."
"egle-r1991","3","17","34","18 November 2011"," The Folly Thus Disappointing Interpretation of the Book and the Failure of the Twilight Continuum
","I have loved the Twilight books and read them quite a few times. And I have watched all the movies up till now. The first Twilight movie was very inspiring and new – I was fascinated. Although, there were a few major mistakes in the movie. Actually, I saw the movie first and then read all 4 of the books. That led me to the Twilight insanity. I have become a total Twi-heart. I was starved for more and I had been sitting on the edge of my seat for the New Moon movie release. <br/><br/>New Moon was great, if you talk about the content of the movie and it's adequacy to the book. Also, the quality of filming and directing was really high. The thing that was really not though trough carefully was the overdone vampire makeup (especially the men's makeup, Jasper's in particular) that made them very artificial. Though, the director was really strict on the audiovisual art rules and made the movie easy to follow and understand. The movie was romantic and a bit cheesy bus so was the book.<br/><br/>The Eclipse movie was the one which shook me to the core. It was great all the way. Only the development of the story was a bit soupy. But again so was the book. <br/><br/>And finally, yesterday I saw The Breaking Dawn Part I. I have waited for this one even more than the previous ones. And to be honest I was deeply disappointed in the direction of the movie. It was so hard to follow and to understand what is happening – day, night, day, night, here's Edward standing here he's already doing something else, there is Bella dreaming, here is the morning and she is getting ready for her wedding. There was no unity and harmony in the direction of this movie. Sometimes things even looked not logical at all. I think that people, who didn't read the book couldn't really comprehend the chain of the action. There are certain rules that help to build the story of the movie in one undivided line and I think the director should stick to them the next time. <br/><br/>The most ridiculous part was the wolf pack division. The robotic voices and then Jacob's shouting on Sam really cracked me up. I was laughing from this scene until the end of the movie. And I don't really understand why the director chose to represent the movie in this scary and creepy and gross way. It was not at all like that in the book. <br/><br/>To sum up, the failure of the Twilight series has begun. I really hope that the next movie will be a lot better than the last one. Still, I am looking forward for the Part II: it will totally ruin the Twilight series or it will rescue them from the complete absurdity."

And I guess they needed a fight scene in the movie, cause i swear that was not in the book at all. Some of the only real good parts of the movie came in the beginning, with the montage of Bellas friends and family speaking at the movie, that got a couple of good laughs out of the crowd. Overall, in my opinion the movie wasn't worth waiting in the cold for almost 6 hours, but for a the Twilight fans out there, it should be a hit."
"mikeydj7","Null","26","57","15 November 2011"," Exciting and Enthralling: A Review From a Non-Fan
","I hadn't seen any of the Twilight movies before a few months ago, only watched the first and some of the second. Thought the first was okay, kinda annoying at times, and a little weird. The second was boring, flat out.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn is like neither in those ways. It is tense, emotional, and enthralling to watch with a crowd full of eager fans.<br/><br/>There are definite throwbacks to the first movie which fans will (and do) appreciate, there are little Easter eggs which they'll pick up on immediately, but that's not what this review is about. This is a review for the common movie-goer who's only ever heard the hype or the hate about this series. I'm here to tell you, Bill Condon has made a fun and exciting movie that is worth your admission, regardless of your feelings on the rest of the series.<br/><br/>The first thing to note is that the acting, dialogue, and editing are all far, FAR superior to the original three. In short, this is due to Bill's team and the effort he puts into making the best movie he possibly can. Beyond that, the production value shows in the effects and in the staging of certain shots (one of which is in the trailers as Edward catches Bella's head before it hits the ground). This is a professional, crisp-looking movie that still manages to channel the style of the first Twilight.<br/><br/>Now, I won't say this movie is ""one of the greatest ever"" because that's just nonsense. But as far as romance or popcorn flicks go, this is a great, emotional movie and is well worth your viewing. The wolf scenes are all exciting and awe-inspiring, particularly the first one, which sent chills up and down my spine for a solid 30 seconds.<br/><br/>The humor in the movie is also very well done, and every line and beat gets its laughs. Our audience was loving it, especially a reference to a particular piece of art in the Cullen's house.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say is that when the emotional moments come in this movie, they deliver in spades and leave you feeling it. This is due in no small part to the excellent score, written by Carter Burwell. The wedding scene was incredibly touching and so very well done, from start to finish. It may be the best scene in the movie (and this is from a 20- something male who doesn't really buy into the wedding/romance stuff). It is touching, romantic, humorous, all at exactly the right times in exactly the right way.<br/><br/>I do not fit the demographic for this series, and I'll probably never see the second or third Twilight movies in completion, but Breaking Dawn Part 1 was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a theater. Period. The energy in that room was incredible to feel, and just seeing and hearing all those people who were so into everything on the screen was enough to make me smile, much less to know that with every passing frame they were having everything they hoped for delivered, and then some. Congrats to Bill and the team, the fans will adore you, and maybe you'll even get a few converts to the series. You've got one in me."

","This movie is just about as awful as it can get. It is extremely visual,showing unwanted pictures that is not necessary for the producers to show.<br/><br/>It has an extremely bad storyline, consisting out of four parts: 1. The movie starts with sex. 2. The next major scene is the wedding. 3. Then the baby. 4. Following the latter is the fight between vampires and wolves.<br/><br/>It almost seems that the producers had a limited budget and a limited vision. Trying to span the story line over a number of different movies. By doing this, they try to keep the movie short, focused and leaves nothing for the viewer to interpret by him/herself.<br/><br/>I feel making the statement: ""brain dead humans will have a complete understanding of the movie,"" is as good statement as the movie itself.<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie should be rated for 18 year old's."

","I have read the book a few times and was a bit disappointed that the first dance at the wedding and other small things did not make it into the movie. BUT like with Eclipse the book is the detail and the movie the highlights. I loved this movie. I never really liked the character of Jacob and in this movie he actually has a purpose and I can stand him a bit more. The scene with the wolf pack talking was amazing.. The honeymoon was a bit short but still beautiful. Bella looked great on her wedding day but I felt she could have look prettier as she is a beautiful girl but then realized that her transformation trough the movie to the point where she becomes a vampire is the point. She is stunning when she becomes a vampire and the way it was done is amazing.. I have never seen anything like it.. Absolutely amazing. The movie felt a bit hurried although it is nearly 2 hours long, I am definitely seeing it again to catch all the detail I missed the first time. I hate the idea of having to wait a whole year before seeing the conclusion.. but other than that it was worth loosing the sleep for a midnight showing.. LOVE IT.."

","I was so disappointed, I waited 2 years for a movie that was thrown together. It was so fake. when the wolves talking (telepathically)I felt like i was watching a Japanese movie with subtitles. I guess after making billions of dollars on the other movies they did not care to make this movie quality in anyway. It was more of a horror film than a love story The wedding was beautiful, I feel the whole movie was a short version told by someone who did not fall in love with the novel as most of us who have watch the book have. It was more of a comedy of errors than a romantic love story. Some of the movie was not correct. No where in the book did the wolves have a fight with the vampires not physically. Charlie was not threatening Edward, in the end when Edward said "" Jake has imprinted, this what not how it was in the book. In the book there were bets between the vampires on how Bella would react. I am just disappointed. I did not feel the movie captures the true essence of the book"

","I stopped reading the Twilight books after ""Eclipse."" That book bored me to death and terminated any interest of reading the last book, ""Breaking Dawn."" We went to watch ""Breaking Dawn, Part 1"" just tonight because my wife really looking forward to it. I was grateful that I had not read the book, because curiosity about how the story would turn out was the only thing that kept me watching.<br/><br/>The entire sequence from their wedding in the woods to their honeymoon in Brazil was maybe 45 minutes too long. They could have cut and compressed all of that hilariously cheesy stuff and maybe ""Breaking Dawn"" could have only been one movie, instead of two parts. As with the first three books, Bella continues to row her boat between the two rivers. Yes, even after her wedding to Edward, she continues to flirt with Jacob! Yet these two guys remain incredibly and illogically loyal to her. Anyhow, that was what Stephenie Meyer wrote, so fans of the book will be expecting that.<br/><br/>The part about Bella's baby and how it was born was at least suspenseful. But this part only started maybe in the last 30 minutes of the whole film. The fight scenes with the wolves and vampires were too close-up to be clearly exciting. The medical aspects of the C-section were not to be taken seriously. The artificially white faces of the vampires especially on Carlisle and Emmett were awfully distracting. However, the make-up and special visual effects on Bella's look during the pregnancy were realistically eerie. Jacob's imprinting scene was also well-executed.<br/><br/>Kristin Stewart was as bland as ever as Bella. Robert Pattinson was as cheesy as ever as Edward. Taylor Lautner does a bit better as Jacob, maybe because of how nobly his character had been written. Most of the other supporting characters, human, vampire and werewolf get a line or two. Memorable one-liners from Billy Burke as Bella's dad Charlie, and Anna Kendrick as Bella's friend Jessica before and during the wedding, made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>This movie is strictly for the entertainment of Twilight fans who will love it. It is up to par and keeps the spirit well with the rest of the other Twilight films. For non-Twilight fans who haven't read the book though, at least this installment does manage to keep your interest. I have no idea what else is left for Part 2 to tell. It felt like they could have ended the franchise with this one already since the love story seems to have been settled, if not only for financial considerations. My wife will see this whole film differently though. Hehe."

I read the book and the wedding is supposed to be a huge event, where Bella looked gorgeous. Well, she was beyond plain, her nails were not even done!!! Her facial expression was of extreme fear and uncertainty, instead of joy and love, like you would expect from someone who is getting married to the love of her life. The wolves were much smaller compared to the other movies - that's what happens when you have one director for each movie. I was in love with the book and this movie ruined it for me.

","I am not a Twilight fan, but I hadn't been to the movies in a while so I decided to see this one, but I say this to all you movie lovers out there ... wait until the DVD comes out. <br/><br/>Every plot point is shown in the trailer, so there are really not going to be that many spoilers in this review. <br/><br/>The plot: <br/><br/>Edward and Bella get married and Bella gets pregnant. The question is: How is she going to have a vampire baby while she's still human? & Why is Jacob still around? <br/><br/>My thoughts: <br/><br/>Even with there being very few plot points in the film, the filmmakers are able to stretch the film into a two full hours. But my conclusion is ... If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. <br/><br/>Jacob wasn't needed. I mean  Edward and Bella have been together since the first film and are now married, you'd think that Jacob would finally get the idea ... but no, he's still there. In my opinion Jacob is no longer needed and neither is the pack of wolves. The story is centered around Bella and Edward, Jacob is just dead weight to the viewer now. Why is he still there? No one knows. <br/><br/>Here are some pros & cons about the film ... <br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>1. The one thing I really loved about the movie were the locations ... very beautiful! The magnificent forest and the waterfalls. I loved the part where Edward and Bella honeymoon in Rio De Janeiro. The island they are on and the cabin type hut they live in is really beautiful. <br/><br/>2. Even though I believe Kristen Stewart can't act to save her life when it comes to dialog and emotions, I think the birth scene was very intense and very believable so props to her for that specific scene. <br/><br/>I also read that Kristen Stewart lost weigh for this role, so I give her much credit for that, but ... her acting is still blasé, meaning that her character Bella never seems to be happy or sad or anything. Did Stephenie Meyer write the character ""Bella"" thinking: ""I want a character with no emotions"" if that's the case then Kristen is a genius. <br/><br/>3. The major thing that anyone can agree on, whether a Twilight fan or not, is the ending. It was very good, it was suspenseful, it was an open ending, which means it was a ""to be continued "" ending and it left the audience wanting more. I really love those kinds of movies. <br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>1. The acting & dialog<br/><br/>2. There are very many character traits that I hate about Bella. For instance: No matter what Bella is going through she never seems to understand that things are bad, and she's always in denial when it comes to her safety and well being. ""Everything is gonna be okay Jacob"" she says, as she can barely sit on the couch and is skinny as hell. Another thing I don't like is that she never listens to anyone, not Jacob not her father not even Edward. <br/><br/>3. If you just happen to wander into the movie theater this film is being played in, you won't understand anything unless you have seen the other 3 films, which is a minus. <br/><br/>4. As in the three last films there are too many close ups! Which irritates the viewer and reminds them that they're watching a movie. I hate when this happens because it ruins the enjoyment of watching the story. <br/><br/>5. There is one point in the movie when the pack of wolves gather and ""talk"" to each other ... telepathically? I think that was weird and just made the movie more stupid. <br/><br/>6. THE HUGE SPOILER! Edward doesn't sparkle in this movie and neither do any of the other vampires. Most of the scenes are during the day time when the sun is shining.<br/><br/>Here are some more big problems I have with the movie: <br/><br/>1. Charlie, Bella's dad, never seems to be concerned or have a problem with the fact that Bella is getting married so soon. Yes, she is 18 but her father doesn't have any opinions about it? Nothing to say? It seems unrealistic to me. <br/><br/>2. Some new characters are introduced at the wedding and then never seen again through out the entire film. These new characters have something big to say and they disappear. Moments like that deceive and confuse the audience. <br/><br/>3. The wedding scene was to long and boring, it took a while before the first plot point happened. <br/><br/>All in all ... no matter what is said and done, Twilight fans are going to love this movie whether it's good or not. But as for me ... I give this film 2 out of 5 stars. It was watchable but definitely not a movie I would see twice."

","I'm not that old (> 30 < 35), but I feel older after every Twilight installment since Catherine Hardwicke's first. I'm also increasingly convinced Kristen Stewart is a zombie. But a good zombie in the box office sense of zombies who connect to audiences similarly disconnected or detached from anything authentic except self-absorption via texting or phone app.<br/><br/>That's why I somewhat understood the Harry Potter franchise. I could see the human values that drove Harry & friends to choose as they did, to do what they must, hence it's real, imperfect connection to ""people"" despite surreal, fantastic wizardry.<br/><br/>But Twilight?

"prince_c3","Null","7","12","21 November 2011"," How come any one like this movie
","Well, I don't want to sound rude or offensive. Also I don't come out and write reviews about every movie release every Friday. But as I was expected after watching this low standard, crappy quality, soft porn in the name of movie making, I was expecting all the negative comments and not at all expecting any positive reviews from even the die hard fans of Twilight. But by looking at only 1 positive comment and rating out of 55 negative comment made me think, what happen to the new generation, but I don't blame them, they are all kids of 15-24 years and haven't seen or know what movie making or what is Hollywood stands for. If these kids really wants to watch the so called Vampire and Werewolf movies and some quality into fiction. Go watch Interview with Vampire, Dracula and few others. But this is total insane, in fact this series totally kill the future of vampire and werewolf movies, I really like this genre and been watching these movies since I was kid, but the quality and drama and crappy acting of the entire cast, on the top of that the crappy direction which is so low in standard that they kill the prospect of future movies on this genre, people would start thinking and comparing any future good or bad movie with these movies and certainly those movie will get killed before even given a fare chance. I strongly recommend that the censor not only look for offensive scene and language but they should look for quality of movie making and ban these kind of low standard movies and director altogether. At least there is some chance of Hollywood to regain its past glory. Now a days Japaneses, Korean, Spanish and Mexican movies are far better and superior in quality."

","I adore Twilight, loved the books & the movies so far. However, I am very glad that it has been so long since I read Breaking Dawn, as I was disappointed with this movie as it stood. It was too slow & too simplistic for my taste. <br/><br/>Just as the pace starts to pick up, the movie ends!  So I loved the last 10 minutes or so. The rest? Enjoyable but not fantastic. I was ready to be blown away but I wasn't. My expectations were just too high.<br/><br/>I think this film suffered from producers' greed. With some good editing, the first half of the movie could have been trimmed down enough so the book was encompassed in one movie instead of two, albeit a much longer one. No question that wouldn't have been as big a cash cow of course! And money is the name of the game.<br/><br/>I also found Stephanie Meyer's cameo at the wedding gratuitous. What an ego! She looked like she was giving the union her benevolent blessing. Pleeeeease!"
"racheldee27","3","12","24","18 November 2011"," Had the potential to please all twilight lovers however this falls short of any real entertainment.
","So I have found myself thoroughly disappointed by the latest twilight film, I am a huge fan of the entire saga and loved the books. The other 3 films have left me satisfied, they were humorous and generally followed the plot however the latest film is sadly disappointing. The start is slow however this is forgivable as so is the book. But you expect the film to improve have a little more debt, but this doesn't come. Instead you find yourself bewildered by some really bad directing. At one of the key moments when Jacob (Taylor Lautner) leaves the pack we hear some very cheesy manly voices (aiming to be the conversation between Sam and Jacob). Probably one of the cheesiest moments in film history, this is followed by some cliché lines and poor scenes. Bellas (kristen Stewart) pregnancy feels rushed there's no real build up to the birth of the child. Or any emotion, everything is predictable and slow. The final straw was when Jacob imprint's on Renesmee, the cheesy eye contact and then Jacobs voice over while there's white lights almost symbolising a heaven-I almost cried with disappointment. I was expecting another brilliant film with a deep story line wanting you to watch more. However I was left wondering what more could happen 3/4 of the book had already been shown the only thing that makes me curious about the next film is what is there left to show apart from one ""fight"" scene??"
"mad_mandonna","2","14","29","18 November 2011"," A letter to Stephanie Meyer
","Dear Stephanie Meyer,<br/><br/>You Ripped off Buffy the vampire slayer and Southern Vampire Mysteries and have been far too successful with it.<br/><br/>This films pacing is off, acting is wooden and there is no humour except for the terribly written dialogue and ugly unconvincing CGI. Bella is barely a character and more of cardboard cut out, who really isn't a very good example to young women. This girl is badly harmed after having sex with her husband, but its OK cause he didn't mean to do it. That's very reminiscent of what a lot of women in physically abusive relationships say. <br/><br/>It may be fantasy, but teenagers and younger are heavily influenced by what they read and watch so I'm gonna ask Stephanie Meyer.... Can you either stop writing books OR have Buffy (you already stole the characters romance why not the whole character) and have an empowering woman that teens can look up to and not feel repressed by her male counter parts. <br/><br/>Thanks Jay Johnson"

The other three movies and I would be stretching it to say I liked them, but this one I hated. It was a total crap fest. Go read the books you probably get more out of it. Ewww shudder this was a God awful movie. And the whole wolf mental thing, give me a break.

","I just finished reading Littlesongbird's review of Breaking Dawn part 1, and I couldn't agree more with the accurate and well written review. especially: ""Kristen Stewart is much better than she is in New Moon, with much less of the moping and dead pauses, but some of her line delivery is still awkward and her facial expressions for my tastes are lifeless"" In fact my poor husband whom I drag to all these movies (mainly because he drags me to see all the comic-book hero movies) even he has commented on how weird and ugly she looks when she makes those awkward faces. she didn't seem to be like that in the runaways, or the messengers. it's almost like she adopted those mannerisms specifically for this character. but sorry i didn't mean to go off on a tangent.<br/><br/>the movie was OK... I agree that the last 30 mins was suspenseful and interesting. I kinda thought that they would have spent more time on the delivery/death scene. I know in the book it was through Bella's perception but to make it more interesting it would have been nice if it wasn't so blurry. I mean reading that scene in the book made me cry. mostly because I really care for the characters of Bella and Edward, but also because it was just horrific. seeing that scene in the movie I didn't feel hardly as much emotion as i did reading it mostly because i don't really care much for the actors portraying the characters and therefore I wasn't emotionally moved. the movie did a great job making Bella look sickly and weak; it was hard to see some of the scenes of her pregnant.<br/><br/>the first 75% of the movie was uneventful. 40 mins into the start of the movie and she is still setting up for her wedding. flash forward to isle Esmee and its one sweet ocean scene (which BTW I thought was done very tastefully, though there could have been more romantic dial-ague.) and then after that it is a montage of chess playing, kissing, swimming, and Bella flaunting around in Victoria's secret lingerie. an upset maid, a revelation of pregnancy, and then a frantic packing scene to head back home.<br/><br/>personally I didn't like the book... it was one of my least faves due to the fact that it was so boring. it had more to do about Bella getting married/pregnant/dying and more to do about Jacob getting mad/protecting Bella/and imprinting on the baby. and Edward was just sorta eye candy in the book and in the movie.... I thought that this would have been a perfect opportunity to showcase why these two are in love. the first half of the movie didn't have to be word for word from the book. it didn't have to be a montage of wedding shots, honeymoon shots and a pregnancy. I would have enjoyed a little bit more depth and bite to their relationship. more complicated dialogue, more passion, and romance. this movie did not convince me that they were in love. and what was up with the speech scene at the reception? they ate up more time then it needed to.<br/><br/>Part 2, I'm afraid is going to suck; because so much happens in that movie: Bella turns, discovers powers, they have to deal with renesmee, and Jacob constantly being around, then there's the Volturi and the big battle scene not to mention the immortal child coming forth to pretty much testify that he is not a monster, and the cottage scene, a lot to cram into the movie and I doubt that it is going to do the book justice. I'm actually dreading the opening scene of the 2nd part where Bella jumps up gracefully and is all cat like and animalistic, talks to her ""new"" family and then goes hunting with her beloved... I just can't see how Stewart is going to be able to convey ""graceful"" and ""cat like"" I can only imagine that she is going to stumble off the bed, do a lot of awkward silent pauses, bite her lip a lot and pretty much just kinda spazz out a little, before the goes off hunting for the first time..."

The three main characters were the only actors who put something into the film the rest delivered lines terribly and looked bored. The werewolf scenes were i have no words they were terrible and for me ruined the whole movie they looked awful and spoke like transformers. the special effects were rubbish and music choice was terribble at some points. many people said it was amazing and i honestly don't get it and they all say but its twilight and i think many people have just convinced themselves it was good! if you haven't read the books you wouldn't find it as bad and also i don't think you would understand half of it! The more and more i think of it the more i don't get how awful it was and think i would could of done a better job of directing it! I personally think Bill Condon has ruined the twilight series and i cant believe that Stephanie Meyer helped produce this.

","As a Twilight lover, I was extremely excited to see this movie! Overall, I DID like it, but I felt like it was a bit rushed. It goes from one event to the other so quickly that I found myself not being fully captivated by the current event before the next one started.<br/><br/>However, the wedding scene was beautiful and I loved the little bits of humor thrown in (speeches, Charlie's snide comments, etc). I wish there was a bit more of an emphasis on the struggle Bella went through when deciding to keep the baby, though. I felt like it was portrayed as a decision that bummed Edward out a little, whereas in the book, Edward was distraught and tortured by her decision.<br/><br/>Either way, it was still a great movie! They had a lot of stuff to fit into 2 hours, so overall I think they did a good job. Could have been better, but I was definitely not disappointed (and neither was anyone else in the theater).<br/><br/>If you like the saga, you'll love this movie!!

"RicCarr","4","5","8","25 November 2011"," A story that could've been told in 30 minutes...
","Breaking Dawn as a book is quite extensive, it takes up more than one afternoon to read it, but a lenghty book doesn't necessarily requires to be split in two parts when making the screenplay adaptation, and sadly, the core story during this first part takes only 30 minutes to be told with the rest being only space filler.<br/><br/>Bella Swan has gone through quite an ordeal in the last 3 movies to maintain her relationship with the vampire Edward Cullen, despite that relationship actually threatening the well-being and stability of covenants made by mythological werewolves, other vampire clans, human beings and the Cullen family, they only seem to care about loving each other, no matter who has to die or in what kind of gruesome way must a fetus be conceived.<br/><br/>The movie at some times falls into a category that I could describe as disturbing, actually disgusting, we see a skeletal Bella Swan, complete with broken ribs, spine and with a huge bruised belly, about to deliver a vampire baby, actually drinking packages of human blood, and the director didn't hesitate to be graphical on this one, or on the birth scene, in which Edward actually bites Bella's genitals and other parts of her deformed, destroyed body to try and revive her.<br/><br/>On the other hand we see a wolf clan breaking apart and having it's members fight over, because one of their kind is obsessed over a girl who has an obsession of her own but for vampires and who keeps endangering their species, not only turning them against vampires (which happen to be their most hated enemy), but also violating sacred rules which their kind established centuries ago.<br/><br/>The screenplay is really flawed, the script sound cheesy and fake, most of the dialogue seems pretty rehearsed, and every action seems to take forever to be performed, this because they needed to fill time so they can release a second part.<br/><br/>We see a lot of useless actions that happen, Bella spends 5 minutes shaving her legs, another 5 frying chicken, another 5 playing chess, another 5 receiving a hairpin for her wedding, and another 5 drinking human blood with a straw.<br/><br/>In the end, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 takes a huge step back from last year's Eclipse, there's no great action sequences, and the only one, which is the Cullen Vs Werewolf battle, is only 2 minutes long and in complete darkness, there's no concrete climax, the cliffhanger ending that is supposed to be the starting point for next year's movie is not only predictable but also incoherent, just because she turned into a vampire all of a sudden her hair was dyed, makeup automatically applied, nails done, and fake eyelashes appeared.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I felt the need to write a review of the film after reading some of the others written by obvious ""non-fans"" of the series. I love the story, have read the books over and over, and do like all of the films in their own way.<br/><br/>This instalment has some great moments, but also has some really poor bits that literally made my jaw drop! (Most notably the scene with the wolves where the packs break up.) There were always going to be parts of the book that were difficult to translate into film, so I am not saying I could have done a better job, but I feel that the films have almost become a victim of their own success. <br/><br/>There is a lot of CGI in the film - obviously needed for parts of it like the wolves and the bone breaking!! But I feel that there were other bits that would have benefited more from good film making than throwing money at the film.<br/><br/>I also think one of the potentially best scenes was left out; Eclipse left us with a classic lead into opening Breaking Dawn with a scene between Charlie and Edward, but alas nothing! Having said what I have, there are some fantastic moments in the film (the Wedding, Isle Esme, the birth scene etc) that do make up for the bad bits and will please most fans of the series.

"angeldust_1975","2","8","15","20 November 2011"," So sad that Breaking Dawn was so disappointing :(
","Within the 1st 5 minutes I was disappointed. At the end of Eclipse (movie) there was the big hype about Bella and Edward having to break the news to Charlie about getting married. In my opinion that was something that should have been significant to the movie, but instead was not included at all. There wasn't the same feel to the movie as the rest of the series. All the characters seemed out of character with the exception of Jacob. The make up for the Cullen's and other Vampires were done very poorly. None of them were pale enough therefore none of them looked like they were vampires. Jasper and Emmett didn't even look like the same people. I felt that parts of the movie were rushed where they shouldn't have been(ie Bella discovering she was pregnant and when Jacob imprinted). They changed things in the movie from the book that they shouldn't have or did not need to change(ie.in the book the wedding took place inside the house not outside). In my opinion when they change directors/producers they ruin the saga's, the same thing happened with Harry Potter.. I'm so disappointed that the last movie has been done so poorly. I feel there were only a few parts in the movie that were done well.. and even then those are few and far between :( Hopefully part 2 won't be as disappointing."

"Chris_Pandolfi","5","9","18","18 November 2011"," There's a Little Blood Sucker on the Way....
","All has been leading to this moment. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), form-fitted in a modern but elegant white wedding dress, walks down the aisle, surrounded by nature. She clutches the arm of her father (Billy Burke), who stays as reserved as he can, although he's clearly fighting back emotions. Eagerly awaiting her at the altar is her fiancé, the vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), who continuously smirks at her gentleman-like in his well-cut tuxedo. We hear little of the preacher, although we do cut back and forth between Bella and Edward's vows. As they kiss passionately, the camera circles them both, revealing just how lost they are in this one perfect moment – all of the guests, including the entire Cullen clan and Bella's friends and family, have disappeared. Only when they hear applause do Bella and Edward snap back into reality.<br/><br/>It's a good thing they're officially married, because Lord knows the first three ""Twilight"" films exhausted the abstinence metaphor. We do get a little more of it in ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1,"" namely when Edward takes Bella to a private island off the coast of Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon; he carries her over the threshold into a luxurious beachside cabin, and after skinny dipping in the moonlight, they finally consummate their marriage in the bedroom. They saved themselves for each other, you see, which is in accordance with the Mormon beliefs of Stephenie Meyer, author of the original books. Bella is all smiles when she wakes up the next morning, although she's shocked to discover that the bed has been nearly destroyed. Later on, she discovers bruises all over her body. Edward feels terrible. Bella could have told him that this happens to lots of vampires, but then again, she would have no way of knowing. Neither, for that matter, would he.<br/><br/>The sermonizing will officially end when Edward finally bites Bella and transforms her into a vampire, which up until now has gone against his moral code. But keep in mind that this story has been split into two chapters – I suspect because it was done so successfully with the last installment of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise. For now, we shift gears and venture into far more controversial territory, namely abortion. On their honeymoon, Bella discovers that she's pregnant. This would be impossible under ordinary circumstances, but because her child is half vampire, it gestates at an alarming rate. By the time the newlyweds return to the Cullens' Washington home, Bella's health has drastically declined. The baby is literally destroying her from the inside out. Bones break. Vital nutrients are depleted. As her stomach expands, the rest of her body becomes sallow and emaciated.<br/><br/>This sparks a debate. Some of the Cullens refer to it as a fetus while others stress that it's a baby. Some, including Edward, believe the pregnancy should be terminated. Others, including Bella, cannot bear the thought of ending a life. This didactic argument is complicated by the arrival of the hotheaded teen wolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), who knew that Edward's vampire strength might have killed Bella in the bedroom – and yes, I am suppressing giggles right now. The leader of Jacob's pack plans on murdering Bella's unborn child, for he believes it to be a threat. Exactly why he feels this way is not adequately explained, but admittedly, I never bothered to familiarize myself with Meyers' books or even with the movies, so I'm sure I missed something along the way. Whatever the reason, Jacob must learn to put his hatred of the Cullens aside if he's to save Bella from canine carnage.<br/><br/>""Breaking Dawn"" is like all of the ""Twilight"" movies in that it's not very good. What surprises me is that my reasons for disliking it don't reflect my feelings for the other films. If anything, I've come to expect the soapy melodrama, the excessive length, the unreasonable pacing, the strained performances, and the preachy subtexts. What I wasn't prepared for was the inconsistency in tone, the film shifting wildly from inappropriate humor to overwhelming solemnity. The latter is reserved mostly for later scenes, which are surprisingly disturbing given the context of the story. For the first time watching a ""Twilight"" movie, I was actually unsettled by some of the imagery.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Bill Condon, who wrote the screenplay for ""Chicago"" and was both writer and director of ""Dreamgirls."" Given this history, I would expect him to have a much better ear for music. I'm not referring to Carter Burwell's score; the incidental soundtrack is a collection of alternative rock songs, all of which are thematically and structurally inconsistent with the scenes they're paired with. He said in a 2010 interview with Mania.com that he was ""very excited to get the chance to bring the climax of this saga to life on screen,"" but considering some of the other films he has directed, including ""Kinsey"" and ""Gods and Monsters,"" I have a sneaking suspicion that his attachment to ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1"" was strictly for hire. Perhaps I'll feel differently once ""Part 2"" is released next November. Then again, perhaps I won't.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

I actually think this movie was Kristen Stewart's best acting in this series so far, she is a lot less awkward, she doesn't bite her lip as much, and she surely didn't look like it was such a struggle to speak. Too bad it took her, and pretty much the rest of the cast, 4+ years to get where they are now in their acting abilities for these movies. In my eyes, Billy Burke (Charlie Swan) steals the spotlight whenever he does a scene and as soon as he's no longer in a scene, I lose a little interest. <br/><br/>Not much action, as always and surprisingly, this was the 1st gruesome Twilight film, and thank god it was! You'd think that with all the money this franchise has made they would do something about their special effects/makeup artists or lack of. They have always been horrible and for once, they didn't suck so much when it came to Bella Swan's pregnancy. Pretty much everything else was laughable or down right embarrassing. A lot of their ""special scenes"" is something I am sure 1st/2nd year film students could do and think of.<br/><br/>Seeing as how I read the books, I had an idea of where the director would cut the movie off, Bella turning into a vampire. The whole revival ending scene, with her opening her red ass eyes kind of killed the movie for me. I seriously sat there as the last few seconds of it rolled and thought, ""Oh let me guess, she's going to open her new red vampire eyes and end scene."" and thats exactly what happened.

","""Breaking Dawn, Part 1"" reaches new levels of weirdness even by ""Twilight"" standards. Whereas previous installments of the series preached abstinence before marriage, the message in BD1 seems to be that sex, even after your wedding vows, can basically kill you ! Not to mention the ludicrous idea that women should put up with a husband or partner who physically hurts them because they love him, or that a woman's future mate should be picked when she is born (i.e. the ""imprinting"" nonsense). The author and the screenwriter do not make any effort either to conceal their position on abortion (""it's a baby, not a fetus""), which is not justified in the movie/novel even to save the mother's life ! Bella is actually willing to die rather than terminate her pregnancy, which is plainly insane.<br/><br/>Having said that, leaving aside the absurd plot (which is Stephenie Meyer's fault), the movie itself is not as bad as most professional reviewers are saying. As expected, it doesn't have as many cool fighting scenes as ""Eclipse"", but I wouldn't call it boring or excessively slow-paced as most other reviewers claim. I am also assuming most of the action will be left to Part 2, where, unlike in the book, we will probably see a much bigger/epic showdown with the Volturi guard.<br/><br/>As far as the cast is concerned, as we all know, Taylor Lautner (""Jacob"") over-acts and Robert Pattinson (""Edward"") can't act (period!), but Kirsten Stewart (""Bella"") actually does a better job in BD1 than in previous Twilight movies. Bella's physical deterioration during her pregnancy, the traumatic baby delivery, and her transformation into a vampire are well handled and acted, although the little ""Avatar moment"" in the final scene when her eyelids open revealing a red iris is somewhat anti-climatic and predictable. The scene where Bella drinks blood from a straw in a soda cup is likely to be long remembered as a classic though ! Billy Burke (""Charlie""), Anna Kendrick (""Jessica"") and Ashley Greene (""Alice"") are great as always in the few scenes they have and I had a pleasant surprise with minor cast members who were finally given more lines like Julia Jones (""Leah"") and Boo Boo Stewart (""Seth"").<br/><br/>Finally, Bill Condon's directing is OK, though not outstanding, but, given the bigger budget he had for the movie, we could have seen better CGI and, especially, make-up, which looks awful compared to previous movies. I also agree that the background music was often too loud, overwhelming the scenes. On the much-criticized ""wolf talk"" scene, to be fair, it is pretty much how Stephenie wrote it in the book. Bill Condon uses multiple voices talking over each other precisely to illustrate how the wolves' ""hive mind"" works. Viewers can appreciate then why Jacob and Leah are so relieved (and glad) that ""it's finally quiet"" when they are severed from the pack's telepathic link."
"neil-476","5","8","16","27 November 2011"," Soppy drivel
","I do so want to be fair to the Twiglet films and not condemn them out of hand just because of what they are, but they do make it so easy to be dismissive of them. To put it another way, a film which is not that good gives you plenty of things to make fun of when you are assembling a review, and Breaking Down part 1 is just such a film.<br/><br/>Sulky teenager Bella has finally got her man (or, rather, vampire), dishy (if moody and, on the basis of this film, incredibly stupid) 100-odd year old pasty-faced Edward. The entire first half of this film comprises wedding, honeymoon, and Bella's immediate (and problematic) pregnancy. If you have seen the trailer, then you needn't bother turning up for the first 45 minutes, because you don't find anything out during that period that you didn't learn from the trailer. This part of the film is terminally soppy - I mean, deeply drippy. So much so that it might even be off-putting to the drippy Twiglet teens who dote on this stuff (I don't mean to be rude, girls, but come on - this really is the soppiest drivel ever committed to celluloid).<br/><br/>The problem is that Bella and Edward have not only gone for no sex before marriage, they've also gone for no vampirising before marriage either so, when Bella falls pregnant with a half-vampire baby, she is still human. This means that the super-strong foetus proceeds to kick 7 bells out of her from inside, which wipes the smile off her face - oh, wait, Bella never has a smile on her face, does she? (actually, there are times during the wedding-y bits where she does - Kristen Stewart was so unrecognisable that I thought they had cast another actress for a moment). <br/><br/>The entire second half of the film is given over to Bella's pregnancy which looks increasingly likely to end with her death, the werewolf pack which seems to have its nose out of joint over something or other which completely escaped me, and Bella's werewolf friend and would-be second-string boyfriend Jacob keeping the two factions at bay and being angry at hubbie Edward for causing all this . Blahdie blahdie blah, it all arrives at an ending which is ripe for the start of what (oh please let it be so) should be the final part.<br/><br/>The first film was grim - desperately bad. The second film was terminally tedious. The third one I found myself enjoying, to my surprise. This one - it is laughable. For instance, on seeing that Bella is very noticeably pregnant (and looking a bit rough), lovelorn werewolf Jacob launches himself angrily at husband Edward with the words, ""You did this to her!"" I burst out laughing. Yes, mate - her husband got her pregnant: it is the sort of thing which sometimes happens on honeymoon, do you werewolves know nothing? Some of the Twiglets in the audience didn't find it as funny as I did, mind you.<br/><br/>The werewolves did angry telepathing among themselves while they were in doggy form, which was comical (I don't think it was meant to be). In human form, they started talking about imprinting. This is the first time the term has raised its head in the Twiglet movies. Previously I had understood it to mean that Canada Geese thought that a motorised hang-glider was their mother, but I didn't have a clue what it meant in this film. My only thought was that it would probably turn out to have some plot relevance, and so it does. Indeed, it turns out to be something of such importance that the fact that it was introduced just before the plot needs it, struck me as extraordinarily bad writing - we should have known about it a couple of films ago.<br/><br/>I could go on, but there seems little point. This, in my view, was a poor effort in a generally poor series, possibly - probably - because the source material is also poor."

"lydia16125","10","14","33","18 November 2011"," errr........what was that?
","Well, as a person who has not quite made up her mind of the franchise yet, i'll let you know how I feel after I get this review out of my system<br/><br/>(contains spoilers)<br/><br/>So the movie starts off with Lautner running off (shirtless) into the woods after seeing the wedding invitation. My fella, who was sitting beside me, gave me one of them looks as to say 'why did you drag me here"".<br/><br/>So after that we finally get to see Bella and the Cullen clan setting up the wedding. Also Edward comes to visit Bella before the wedding to show us a glimpse of his past. Err thank GOD there was actually something vampire related in this movie. Heck, I thought they were faeries the way they all glittered. But we actually see some neck biting and blood in this movie. (Unknown at the time that this was only breaking us in until the end)<br/><br/>So the wedding happens, the dress is nice, she looked nice and damn even her woodland wedding was nice. <br/><br/>Stewart plays Bella well and no one can say she doesn't. The emotions are there. The feel of the movie was refreshing, different. I know for a fact it won't appeal to everyone. I hated the first movie, thought it was so...cliché and Bella and Edward scenes were over the top. It's refreshing to see the characters grown up and acting mature. Including Bella. <br/><br/>So the honeymoon. Bella's frantic human moments having a breakdown of the underwear Alice packed. It was good. The sex bit was a bit of Edwards back, a headboard of a bed breaking and Bella completely in the clouds. Afterwards my fella turns around and goes, 'is that it?'. Men, I had to remind him of the PG-13 rating. <br/><br/>So at this point it seems to go downhill. Bella learns she's pregnant, Edward is determined to get the 'thing' out of her. Bella makes arrangements with Rosalie because she doesn't want to get rid of the baby. By this point my fella was snoring beside me.<br/><br/>When the camera's went off Bella and Edward. It's where the film seriously lacked. Even though in the book it tells a few chapters of Jacob, I really wanted it to return to Bella and Edward. The whole fight between the Cullens and werewolves was so pointless (that wasn't in the book)<br/><br/>The birth, well it's definitely not a let down. I was worried last year they couldn't do it under a PG-13 rating. It was going to be rubbish and I would be disappointed. No, it's good. The way Bella's back breaks actually made me squirm, Rosalie cutting Bella's body open, the screams. Edwards teeth. Argh! geez, Bella looked awful and hopefully will put 13 year olds off having a kid for a while! <br/><br/>One thing I just hated...Why CGI THE BABY! she looked ....strange that's for sure, I was going to let them off with the CGI wolves but the baby just looked...freaky. <br/><br/>I get why people are like ""Jacobs a peado"" But I think they could have explained that better in the movie where it's not how it sounds or looks.<br/><br/>Bella's transformation into a vampire...Can I have one of those injections please? <br/><br/>So my verdict, crap when the camera's are off Bella and Edward. Good when they are on. The story is definitely fan appealing, for those who haven't read the books will be horrified and confused. They need to sort out the animation and the CGI freak baby. <br/><br/>Go and see it if you're not expecting much."
"paulespie","6","10","22","18 November 2011"," Here is hoping that Part 2 has a little more action!
","I adore the franchise. I hated it when I first watched Twilight but with time I am a complete fan and couldn't wait to watch this episode.<br/><br/>I have not read the books but I kind of wished I had done as I am continually reminded how much better they are.<br/><br/>This is surely the last stepping stone though as I found myself wondering if there will ever be any action or real confrontations! I always get the feeling i am being short changed by the studios! The fight scene between Edward and the Volteri in New Moon and the mini war with the new borns just seemed too rushed and under used. There is no action in this movie however I had prepared myself for that. <br/><br/>I can simply say it like it really has to be said..... Don't watch it if you ain't seen all the others or you ain't a fan.... You simply come on this site to discourage others. For the Twilight fans amongst us.... and I am a grown man certainly not lusting after the Edward and Jacob crews (definately a Rosalie fan however) its a certainty that you will enjoy it and be gripped into the final installment which is far too far away!!!"
"melanie-hurst88","Null","7","14","20 November 2011"," Cheesy and disappointing ..Should have been rated R!
","I was actually pretty excited to see this movie. Im not a huge die-hard twilight fan but I did enjoy the others twilight movies. I knew the story line was going to be weird because she gets pregnant with a vampire baby but not this weird. This movie should have been rated R. I was disturbed about the fact that little teens go and see this movie when it was full raw sex scene and a lot of blood. Not to mention the movie had several awkward and weird parts.From the wolfs speaking without there mouths moving ..(.very cheesy!!) To bella drinking blood out of a foam cup with a straw like a shake from Jack N the box. It was just awkward is the wway to describe to.. esp when she wanted to name her Child EJ for edward jacob ...i evenn heard some people say in the theater were like WHAT THE ...is this is a joke. I have no idea what the writers were trying to prove in this movie. But her affection for jacob was really weird esp. the fact that edward was A-OK with it.And him cuddling with her to keep her warm right in front of in.. This movie was really disturbing at the end when he got the baby out by bitting threw her stomach..and when her back broke when she was about to have the baby like she was an possessed..creepy .....And another thing that didn't make sense is that wouldn't she become a vampire if the baby was bitting her stomach inside her since the baby was a vampire child? ya didn't make sense to me. It was just really pointless and kind of irratated me that she wanted to be a vampire so bad in all the movies then all of a sudden wanted to wait because she didn't want to be ""in pain"" so stupid... Like the other reviews said if u want a good laugh go see this its def. not an Oscar winning performance and movie.. i can tell you that much. This movie was strictly made for money and you can tell they kind of rushed to make it Ill probably see it again when it comes out on DVD just when im sad and need a good laugh. thumbs down."
"BummedAgain","5","7","14","19 November 2011"," The usual from Summit
","I went in expecting the usual f'ery from Melissa Rosenberg and that is exactly what Summit delivered again. Best lines from the book omitted...inane scenes and dialog added...Bella never ever looks happy, even when she is getting exactly what she wants. I did love her wedding dress, the cottage on Isle Esme, and the ending of the movie. The inclusion of the wedding toasts was completely stupid, who does that? Were they supposed to be drunken rants? OMG, when Jacob broke from Sam's pack was cringe- inducing laughable. Bill Condon should be ashamed, really. If they wanted to put some humor into the drama, why not put in the Rosalie vs. Jacob banter. The dog dish, the blonde jokes...now that was funny.<br/><br/>The hair and makeup team must have passive-aggressive tendencies. How else can you explain how such gorgeous actors have been made to look so awful? That is where Catherine Hardwick excelled, she let the sexy shine through and really made this group of actors something that fans wanted to see. I weep for Carlisle's flat red hair in this movie.<br/><br/>I had hoped that Stephenie's presence on the set may have kept the story more focused. Giving her face time at the wedding was kinda cute but it immediately took me out of the movie. <br/><br/>I am a full fledged Twitard so I will go to BD 2 regardless but my love for the saga remains for the books, not the movies. Summit earns less of my hard earned cash with each crappy adaptation that they offer up."
"Susie-daisy","10","13","31","18 November 2011"," Beautiful
","The Twilight Saga is essentially a love story. When I go see a Twilight film at the cinema I'm going because I want to see the story of Bella & Edwards love, any extra action in the movies is just a bonus. If you don't like watching films that focus on two people in love then just don't go see Twilight, but don't take the time to review it either because your judgement of the film won't be valid if it was just never going to be your type of film to begin with. Anyway, as a 25 year old female I thought this film was beautiful. I've read the books but I try not to read them too much before seeing a film because then I'd just be going over everything that was missed out or not done exactly right. I just go see the film for what it is, their best effort to make a film 'based' on a very thick book. I was so happy with Breaking Dawn. Wedding scenes are of course scenes that countless films and TV shows have done again and again but no wedding has ever been filmed as beautifully as this one. I felt like I was there and I was getting a bit emotional watching it. One of the great things about this movie is that a lot of time is spent on getting the romance and real love between Bella & Edward right. These guys are good together, and it was nice to see them so happily in love. Kristen and Rob have worked hard to get these scenes exactly right and as I fan I really appreciate that. While I was looking forward to the wedding and sex scene, the other scenes I was a bit unsure of as I wasn't really sure how they could film it on a way that would work but it certainly exceeded my expectations and the imprinting and birth scene were both done amazingly. I won't go on about every scene I loved, I'll just say I was thrilled with this movie as were the people I was with and anyone else I've spoken to about it. Also the final scene, couldn't have done it any better, it was visually amazing to watch.<br/><br/>Definitely the most emotional and beautiful Twilight film so far. Well done to everyone who worked on this film : )"
"GirishGowda","7","8","17","28 November 2011"," Breaking Dawn: Part 1
","As a guy, I can say that I pretty much like all the Twilight saga movies, ""Twilight"" being my most favorite of the lot, like a sweet first crush, I suppose. We already know that the Twilight movies have a huge fanbase and a lot of haters too. If you know you won't like the movies, I just wonder why you would even bother watching this in the first place or if you are just dragged into it by your friend, girlfriend or somebody, you should already know what you are getting into. I also don't see why the movies or the actors attract so much hate. Robert is a good actor and Kristen, in particular is very versatile in movies other than The Twilight Saga. Bella is supposed to be awkward, nervous, clingy and moody even in the books. So, keeping that in mind, Kristen does a terrific job in portraying her character of Bella Swan. Also, come on, there is no such thing as 'real vampires' and hating on it just because of that is immature. You can dislike it all you want because lets be reasonable and face it, the acting nor the writing is groundbreaking. I have read all the books too and they aren't as good as many would have you believe, but both the books and movies are entertaining enough if you have an open mind and don't expect miracles.<br/><br/>Moving on to the plot. Its 'The Wedding of the Century' between the vampire, Edward Cullen and his human soulmate, Bella Swan. Jacob, in a fit of rage and agony runs off into the woods hearing about their matrimony. Everything is proceeding wonderfully during the wedding, with the occasional jealousy from Jessica bubbling to the surface. Jacob arrives to the wedding to see Bella in her human form for one last time before she is whisked away by Edward and turned into a vampire. In what is a very honorable move by Edward, he lets his bride to have a dance with him. She confesses her plans on consummating her marriage in her human form which enrages Jacob. Edward travels to Isle Esme, a gift by his father, in Portugal with Bella for their honeymoon. In a twist of fate, he ends up impregnating her and the rest of the story is about Bella's determination to keep the 'abomination' growing inside, no matter the deathly consequences it will have on her. The wolf pack wages a war on the Cullens, since it has its own set of rules and cannot let her 'baby' live.<br/><br/>This movie is more mature in its themes and tone compared to the previous ones, even though it is quite lacking in content. Oscar winner, Bill Condon has done as good a job as he could, by staying completely true to the original book source and thereby gaining the appreciation of all the Twihards. The story flowed smoothly and the effects were spectacular. Making the wolves to converse in autobot voices was an awesome touch. The opening sequence with Bella having a nightmare, where she marries Edward over the top of a pile of dead bodies, which had her friends and family was hauntingly fitting. The movie is filmed beautifully and the Carter Burwell's score and the songs are perfect in most of the scenes, though the songs may be overbearing in some sequences. And what's up with Edward talking in British accent all of a sudden and not sparkling in the sunlight! Well, it did make the movie better in my opinion. <br/><br/>Much has been hyped about the sex scene since its inception. I was expecting it to be hilariously cheesy from the trailers, but was pleasantly surprised by the subtlety that Condon brought to them. I am, and always was, a fan of Edward-Bella, but have to say that the director could have spent a little less time on the honeymoon and wedding scenes and put in some more meat (pardon the pun) in Jacob and the wolf pack story lines. His refusal to obey Sam and breaking off from the pack wasn't done properly, because most of the viewers wouldn't understand the sheer will power and strength that took to disobey the leader. His and Rosalie's repartee which was so much entertaining in the books was just glanced upon. His inner turmoil and trying to move on from Bella by roaming the city searching for a soulmate would have added more depth.<br/><br/>Rebecca Mader (Charlotte from Lost), the brother and ice-truck killer in Dexter and some other prominent faces made an appearance at the wedding, who will all play a big part in the next movie. The performances were mostly dependent on the main trio, who acted well, and the rest of them did the best they could have done. The standout being Charlie (Billy Burke) and Jessica (Anna Kendrick) from the rest of the cast in their minor roles. Kristen Stewart deserves a round of applause for making us emotional for Bella during the pregnancy moments and playing the awkward part perfectly, during the wedding and honeymoon scenes. Her skeletal look and the ribcage cracking were exceptionally horrifying with the help of cgi effects. Finally, her transition from the brink of death to a gorgeous vampire, with blood red eyes as the closing moment looked stunning to say the least. Bearing in mind that this is only the first part in the two parter, it laid the groundwork for the last movie quite well. I can't wait to watch Breaking Dawn: Part 2, since all the fast paced and cool bits will be in that movie."

","Come on people! It's just a movie! What is with the harsh reviews? If you're a hater, why do you bother watching in the first place? I loved it. It's my favourite of the series so far. I did enjoy the book but found it too long and drawn out. The movie depicts the story in a perfect amount of time and cuts out all the boring stuff. I am disappointed that I have to wait a year for part 2...surely, they could have made a 2.5 hr movie and ended it now. The wedding was beautiful, the honeymoon sweet and fun - hopefully the uncut version is on the DVD - the pregnancy, birth and transformation - amazing - Kristen is never better as Bella than in this film. Everyone is talking about the wolf telepathy segment - but how else would they have done it? I just think everyone is too hard on this series.

","So on Saturday I was able to watch this movie! To tell you the truth I enjoyed it very much! I have read the books and I found that the movie had a lot of things that I enjoyed from the book. Of course it has its slow dialog at times... but for those who read the book already know and should be aware of this. In this book and movie.... there really wasn't any fighting scenes so don't expect much action. The honeymoon scenes was funny, cute and they didn't show much so that was good :) I've read in other reviews that you might laugh in the most serious parts well there were some funny parts because of Jacobs's sarcasm... I laughed a lot in the honeymoon scene because of how they made it :P but other than that, for those Twilight readers and fans. I was very proud with the out come!! Oh and one more thing. Jacob and Renesmee imprinting isn't a ""Pedophile"" like some reviews have mentioned. Obviously you aren't well informed or just not smart enough to understand. Like Jacob mentioned when people imprint its not like they just want to marry that person then have sex or whatever. No, its more of a I'll be your protector, your brother, your friend, anything. Well anyway... For those Twilight Fans I recommend you go and watch it.! I loved it :)"
"noah-keppen","10","12","29","18 November 2011"," Breaking Dawn Part 1
","I just returned from a packed theater with my friend. I saw Breaking Dawn part 1. Before I begin I'll tell you that I am a male teenager who is a die hard Twi-Hard. I am on Team Edward. Okay now I'll start.... Breaking Dawn was an enthralling, beautiful movie that was hugely more serious than the other films. It was even scary at times. The CGI was extremely realistic. You could tell that this was made by a new director and that he really knew what he was doing. Also, against what anyone says, the acting was superb. Bella's wedding nightmare scene was terrific. Also her vampire transformation contained cool shots of crystallizing veins. The birth scene was just graphic enough and Kristen's perfect acting made her look completely dead. Seriously, I've read the book about 7 times and I know that she doesn't die but I was convinced that she was actually dead. The final shot is witty and thought out. The perfect time to end the perfect movie."
"KwopKilawtley","Null","6","12","21 November 2011"," Well Done Bill Condon!
","Bill Condon has managed, with Breaking Dawn Part 1, to do what directors of ""Twilight"" ""New Moon"" and ""Eclipse"" have failed to do... Stay true to the book! As a Twilight fan, I of course have seen all the previous movie's countless times, however each film seemed to be lacking something, and each time the credits rolled for each film I found myself wondering if, had I not read the books before hand, I would have understood the storyline the way I did. This was not so in Breaking Dawn Part 1. <br/><br/>Like many other fans I do not mind admitting that I was extremely worried about seeing this film, I feared that the story would not be able to be portrayed well on screen and that key elements of the story would be omitted as they have been with previous films, for the simple reason that ""It was just too hard to show on screen"". But I needn't have worried Condon managed to do the story justice, with help of beyond excellent actors, extravagant special effects, and a script writer who definitely knows her audience. <br/><br/>Condon had the hardest job of all the ""Twilight"" directors, and not just because of Breaking Dawn's tricky, and sometimes controversial storyline, but because he also had to clear up all the mistakes caused by the franchise's previous directors. <br/><br/>So I say again... Well done Bill Condon!!"

Vampire hair does not grow ( Emmet's Fro ) and I am almost positive that somewhere in the books it said that it was strong enough to cut something (so shouldn't be able to be cut). Carlisle looked like a Dork and how did Rosalie go from being really blonde (Eclipse) to having almost brown dirty mop water blonde colored hair, and Esme from Auburn to black?!?! It really ruined it for me............<br/><br/>Other than that the movie was pretty good. Kind of accurate to the book so that was nice..........

This movie is by far my favourite and I'm sure Part 2 will be just as great :) The location of Isle Esme was also absolutely amazing and was just perfect for the vision Stephenie Meyer creates in the book. The movie stays 'thrilling' until the last minute and you just don't want to wait another year for Part 2!"
"NatalieMovieLover","3","4","7","16 July 2012"," Exciting, but at times a little Boring.
","Breaking Dawn Part 1 wasn't really a hit movie to me, but it was definitely something very interesting to watch. Bill Condon really finds a way to make the elements fit together very well. Sometimes in the movie it has some things that are not necessary and at times boring. But, I like feeling the excitement of looking at it. There's vampires against werewolves and Bella of course, gets (intamite) with Edward and Bella gets pregnant. The end left you really wanting to know what's going to happen in the next part. But, I know top notch Twilight fans would be excited to see this and be very willing to look at all of the chemistry and rivalry between the two sides. I really at times got bored around the times where it got all slow. The excitement came when things really started to happen. So definitely not the best movie out of the Twilight Saga or the the best movie ever, but was somewhat worth it and close to the novel."
"priancas","6","4","7","26 November 2011"," cheesy awkward!
","as we all know twilight saga has always been weird this time its awkward. With the whole Edward Jacob team thing i never chose one side, but breaking Dawn woouhh! Edward, I mean Jacob did better then other movies too he has a round character for the first time instead of just anger, he is cute, funny, sad as always. The good thing is the cute scenes when Edward talks. I know that sounds ridiculous, but hes done really good and he looks better then before. Bella hmm well, her acting is horrible in some beginning scenes, the way she conveys her dialogues are just just justifying at all. all other character like Alice, Jasper, Rose, Carloisle etc if it weren't for them the rest of the movie except the honeymoon scenes would be just not worth of watch. Some scenes are confusing especially at the end and not to be a spoiler but once with Jacob. ;). anyways for me the only best part the wedding its pretty funny, cute and the honeymoons funny and romantic. Lastly, Edward rocks the movie and his smile. ha ha"
"alliekat_124","8","7","15","20 November 2011"," THE best by far.
","Honestly, I do have to say that I thought that this movie was the best of all the movies. I think that this was mostly coupled with the fact that Stewart and Pattinson did a MUCH better job acting, maybe because there was less talking and more...action, or maybe Condon just knows how to work with them better. There was definitely a lot less tension between the characters. Secondly, I can understand why someone who hasn't read the book wouldn't like it. I feel like this movie was mostly made for book readers, because parts that would have seemed stupid made more sense in the context of the book. (e.g. shaving her legs, Rosalie's part in it, Edward hearing the baby, Bella writhing in pain as the venom works through her body while remaining motion less on the operating table, Edward's anger at the whole situation, Bella's dreams, etc) in other words, the entire movie. I didn't think it was to complicated for none book readers to understand though, i suppose you'd just have to have a certain taste for the kind of dramatic romance contained in the book. The CGI seemed worse than the thirds, it wasn't the worst CGI i'd ever seen but still. I did feel they did a good job portraying the werewolves thoughts they and though i would have liked to see a little more in relationship build from at least Alice and Jacob or possibly Leah and Jacob, i felt they did a good job covering the most important stuff. What I'm left wondering his how they will successfully introduce the Denali clans back story (book readers know what I'm talking about) without making it seemed kind of forced in there. I realize that it was probably not included so that you wouldn't have to remember it from this movie to understand whats happening in the next movie. Cudos for Taylor Laughtner, I thought he did an excellent job portraying Jacob with all of his snide comments and sarcastic demeanor and natural uncomfortableness at being around the Cullen's all day. I also thought they did a great job at making Bella look sickly and thin. I got cold chills when i saw her shoulder bones. So over all a good movie. the beginning part was always my favorite and the second part just stresses me out to much, and seems like it would be hard to accurately represent without coming across as boring because its a lot of talk and not very much action. I guess we'll find out."

","First of all, anyone who is still not a Twilight fan or has never read the book has no reason to watch this movie. Simply posting a review to push away potential fans shows a great deal of immaturity. If you weren't going to like the story, which admittedly has little action, you probably shouldn't have gone to see it. On to the movie, I went to a midnight premiere and had to sit on the front row because we were only about a minute early and the theater was already filled to capacity. I didn't mind as soon as the movie started as I was enchanted with the happenings on screen. The wedding scene could not have been any more perfect or beautiful. What made it all the more poignant, to a fan like me, was the music featured in the ceremony. As Bella and Edward are reciting their vows, ""Flightless Bird, American Mouth"" plays in the background and serves as a powerful tie of the couple's history together. Then, the music that was playing in Eclipse in the bed scene, ""My Love"" by Sia, is featured instrumentally while Bella's human friends are looking at the cake. This movie finally stayed faithful the book, only including such scenes as the toast speeches that only add more to the story rather than taking away. Any fan of Twilight will enjoy this movie and I daresay the more intense scenes will appeal to non-fans. Make sure and stay after the credits for an extra scene featuring the Volturi."

","""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" is the fourth movie in the series. Edward and Bella get married and soon, Bella is pregnant. The problem is that the child within her is no ordinary fetus. It is deadly and it is killing her from the inside. Literally.<br/><br/>I actually liked the movie. Apart from the all-too-cheesy Edward and Bella scenes, of course. I just wanted to share that I found myself literally giggling at two parts because of its cheesiness. But I did like this movie because of the werewolves- particularly Jacob Black. Jacob added drama and spice to the movie. I was just sorry that the movie didn't feature that much of him. In the book, there were chapters written in Jacob's point of view. I enjoyed those a lot. The werewolves scenes in this movie didn't do the book justice. I wanted more of Jacob. And NOT just because of Taylor Lautner.<br/><br/>This movie basically just revolved around Edward and Bella's unborn child. The movie felt short. I didn't see the need to split ""Breaking Dawn"" into two separate movies. This movie felt more like an 'opening' or a 'teaser', rather than an actual movie. The events here could have been summed up in a few sentences. They should have included the action scenes. I was really looking forward to it. Oh well.<br/><br/>Don't judge this movie too much because of its reputation. Give it a try. It is interesting, for what it's worth. A must see for fans of the series."
"lubo94","7","8","18","18 November 2011"," Loyal to the fans.
","Before I go to into detail, I would like bring notice on why and how the Twilight Saga has become the franchise that it is. The one and only reason why the Twilight saga has taken over the box office is due to its hardcore fans, aka ""Twihards"". So no matter what the films are classified as, they are still going to be successful and continue to smash box office records. So far Breaking Dawn part 1 has received a mixture of both negative and positive reviews but beginning to slightly tilt to the negative side. This could be explained by a few reasons. People should be aware that the Twilight movies are made FOR its loyal fans; ever since the first Twilight film, the directors have created the movies, exclusively to satisfy the ""Twihards"" which is why just like the previous three Twilight movies, Breaking Dawn has its fair share of topless man, incoherent mutterings and plenty of teenage angst, which is why I believe that this movie to some people would be a spectacle and to others, a waste of time. Some of the most noticeable flaws in the movie are those in the script. At some points the dialogue was so irrelatively poor that some would guess that it was written by a bunch of nine year old children. This is where a few of the characters lost personality and became too vague. Two particular scenes that would make you cringe are two that were beautifully written in the book. The coherent flow in the book was nowhere to be found during the scene in which Jacob confronts Bella about her pregnancy and also during the conversation between the pack while they were phased. If this was to be improved, the majority of the feedback would have most likely been positive. Let's look at what director Bill Condon has added to this much anticipated sequel to the Twilight Saga. Condon has managed to capture the purity and endearment that was previously manufactured by Catherine Hardwicke and twist it in to his own odd, modern interpretation. Perhaps this is why the movie has ups and downs; most of the best bits are those that fall into the indie-drama class, the same class that Catherine Hardwicke used to skyrocket Twilight into our lives. Some of the worst bits are the ones that are irrelevant to the Twilight world, and that clearly belong to and should stick to the old Hollywood cliché movies. Even the main actor and actress admit that their favourite twilight movie is undoubtedly the first one, which goes to prove that Hardwicke's recipe in the first twilight movie should have been applied to all other three movies. However something that Condon has added and has actually benefited the movie is his attempt to convey the transformation of the characters into mature adults, as the acting has never looked better. Breaking Dawn is essentially Bella's story. We dwell deeper into the teen's uncertain and passionate mindset as we discover a new side to Bella. Her newly earned motherly instincts have made her more feisty and independent which brings emphasis to her maturity. Kristen has managed to portray the teen's wide range of emotions exceptionally well whilst still remaining faithful to the book. This would also apply to a few other actors in the cast, as even the support actresses and actors have polished their acting skills. A good example of which actor who in particular stood out is Billy Burke (Charlie Swan); The new side of Charlie managed bring a few unexpected laughs, and show a more light-hearted side to Twilight, this new side was acted out shockingly well whilst still corresponding to Charlie's persona in the books. So overall I would say this movie will very much please its ""Twihards"" as it remains very faithful to the book. If you aren't a Twilight fan, this may not be the case. Is this movie worth seeing? Yes. Is it the best Twilight film? No."

For starters, it wasn't able to contain the hype and mystery that makes a series adaptation compelling in every sense, kinda like what the Harry Potter series have done for 10 long years. Can it be because the first movie was an epic failure in terms of production and over-all output or is it possible that its story just doesn't have what it takes? It now becomes a crisis figuring out what went wrong in this movie franchise. Is it the story itself or perhaps just the movie adaptations? Well, I guess it's both.<br/><br/>In the age of True Bloods and The Walking Deads where HOT, sexy, and fierce are being redefined, somehow the vampire and werewolf story this saga presents seems too bland. It's like a steak without salt and pepper, pasta without parmesan. It just feels so cliché, predictable, and unexciting; in short, overrated in epic proportions.

","i gotta say, im on the fence here. i wanted to like the overall movie much more than i really did. the first half of the movie was soooo bad. awkward camera pauses on bella and edward...terrible acting...cheesy lines. like another reviewer, i face-palmed my forehead a few times in disbelief. i could barely get through it.<br/><br/>the second half of the film was MUCH better - the last 30 minutes being pretty dang good! had my heart racing and i actually felt something while sitting there instead of pure agony. i don't understand why the twilight franchise cant seem to nail down one director and go with it. this film actually felt like it was filmed by two separate directors who didn't know how to work together at all. i was blown away. either way, i probably will end up seeing it again..wishing i could fast forward to the end of the movie. dang. its too bad they cant make one really good movie out of all 4 books. each one has serious issues. i don't know why i like these movies at all but its the girl in me i guess....<br/><br/>in the end, go see it! you know you want to even if it is painful in parts!"
"jessica-bourne","10","11","27","21 November 2011"," Awesome and refreshing spin on the ""saga""...
","*Spoilers* I really am amazed to see so many negative reviews about the ""Breaking Dawn-Part 1"" movie.<br/><br/>With the exception of catching a scene here and there of the previous three movies, I never paid too much attention to Twilight. I thought they were G-rated, tween attempts at exploring *anything* vampire. Um, no, that doesn't work. Then, about two months ago (give or take a few days...), I saw the ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" trailer and I was hooked. Never before had I shown any interest in the story until then. I promptly watched Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse - all of which I TOLERATED - in an attempt to gear up for this new installment.<br/><br/>In total contrast, I didn't feel as though I had to 'tolerate' anything. At 26-years-old, I didn't feel ashamed to be sitting in the theater and watching a Twilight movie. I've seen so many people go on and on and on about the movie's lack of action, and how slow it was. I simply MUST ask...do you guys have ADHD or something? I'm no long time Twilight fan, again, but clearly the movie centers around a LOVE STORY. One of my main issues with the other films in the ""saga"", was its lack of focus on the two of them. Everything was fluff, corny lines, glares into each others' eyes, poetic over-the-top acting, and constant brushes with death & danger. It was downright corn ball action.<br/><br/>In 'Breaking Dawn - Part 1', their love was real. Their actions were real. Putting more attention on Bella and Edward as individuals is what made the movie so cool, not slow. I saw actual, GOOD acting this go around. It was literally like watching a bunch of the characters finally grow up. From Bella's jitters before FINALLY sleeping with the man she's loved for two years, to her reflecting and remembering the love making the morning after, to the oh so incredibly cool wolf scene (they all congregate at the lumber place and speak to one another telepathically), to Edward literally witnessing the woman he loves waste away behind this pregnancy, to the actual emotionally charged birth scene, and the cinematography of the flashbacks...the movie was shot in a totally different way than the three prior films were. I really can appreciate that. Not to mention, the wedding dress and final scene in the movie were highlights all on their own for me.<br/><br/>Anyone going to this movie expecting to see an Underworld or Blade is going to be sadly disappointed. But if you're interested in seeing where all of the cheesy banter and lines, eye gazes, and love & sex talk lead good ol' Bella and Edward, watch this movie. You will NOT be disappointed."
"santos7305","10","20","57","17 November 2011"," Breaking Dawn Part 1 is the best one so far!
","BREAKING DAWN IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE IN THE SAGA YET. Bill Condon is a GENIUS! I was able to watch the movie on Monday 14th at the Black Carpet World Premiere in Los Angeles. Now let me tell you that watching the movie amongst 7000+ in attendance is a complete adrenaline rush. You could feel everyone emotions while the movie was playing plus knowing that the stars and Stephenie Meyer were in attendance and could hear our cheers just felt good. Having one tissue was not enough for the complete movie to wipe my tears of happiness. I know now when I go see it tonight once again, to take a box of tissues with me. Breaking Dawn Part 1 is one of the few movies I've watch throughout the years that I can say is just like the book. There is not one moment or scene I would take out or change. Now that I've seen the movie I'm glad they did break it up into two parts because I can't see it being done any other way after seeing the movie Monday. All the favorite elements from the book are in the movie, pus some new elements that work perfectly with what we know from the books too. <br/><br/>I'm not going to describe the story since we pretty much have all read the book and know what happens. I won't spoil anything either since it will be worth the wait just a few more hours to see it tonight or tomorrow. How they end Part 1 is how I always expected they would. Even though I expected it , it was still incredible to watch it on the big screen. Jacob's imprinting will win you over if you haven't been on Team Jacob ever. Taylor killed it with the scene. Kristen was the one character throughout the movie that impressed me the most. I haven't been her number one fan but after her representation of Bella in Breaking Dawn, I'm am a FAN! Kristen does a phenomenal job with her part. You feel all her emotions throughout the movie. Robert as Edward continues to great also. Like I mention this movie is by far the best of all of them, I can't even imagine what part 2 will bring. <br/><br/>What did I enjoy the best from the whole movie? This is the one that felt the most realistic. What do I mean by that. Well the characters interaction with one another. Bella and Edward show a side that we haven't seen before, its like watching yourself with your husband or boyfriend. Its that playfulness that couples share. Even the fighting between then was so realistic, it didn't feel like a script. I honestly could gush all day about how Epic Breaking Dawn Part 1 is. I'm so excited to go again tonight with my mom and live through the wedding and honeymoon once again. Tomorrow I can't wait to read all the comments of those that went tonight to see it."

","DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THE CRITICS SAY!!! They don't like this movie simply because they haven't read it (they don't understand whats going on) and they also have nothing better to do with their time but write negative reviews about something they have know idea what they are talking about. Besides, do critics ever write positive reviews? Hardly ever. That's why they are called critics. So don't just pass on this movie just because of what these people who are out of their mind are saying about it. Give it a chance . I just have to say, if you haven't read this book you will probably not fully understand whats going on or fully enjoy it. I have read it many times and I was thrilled with every moment of this movie. It is absolutely perfect. And to those who hate that it is in two parts don't understand why it is. The book is enormous and if it was all in one movie, it would simply suck. There is too much going on for one movie (contrary to what critics say). Anyone who has read it will love it. If you haven't, then you may not get it. I am just sick and tired of all the stupid people in the world who hated this movie. Get a grip people! If you don't like it for whatever stupid reason that may be, then go on and quit sabotaging it's reviews.

"Ramascreen","Null","6","13","18 November 2011"," Bill Condon's Twilight
","It really is challenging to write up a review for any Twilight movie, especially this fourth installment when you're neither a fan of the books nor the previous movies. Because when you're a fan, you can easily geek out and be stoked about it no matter what. But when you're not a fan, you're faced with the fact that you're going to write about pretty much the same damn thing again because you've noticed a pattern. One thing I'd say is that the build up, before this movie arrives, around how it would depict the sex scene and the birthing process does come in handy in attracting those of us who think that it's a dreadful experience dragging our feet to the screening for another round of Edward-Bella-Jacob..<br/><br/>Dreamgirls director Bill Condon handles BREAKING DAWN PART 1 which I was informed is told through Bella's point of view. They should've added.. Bella's point of view, pain, suffering, and agony, because Bella gets even extra nervous than before, obviously because of the wedding, what that wedding would do to Jacob, moments leading up to losing her virginity and the decision on whether or not to keep her baby, the story sure does put her in very uncomfortable situations one after another to the point of seemingly torturing her. Edward is the concerned husband, the worried dad to be. But what stands out to me is the present development of the character Jacob who goes into some really dark places and by that I mean he seems to be dealing with his own tough choices and the anger or the frustration that he carries may allow him to become a man depending on the choices he makes.<br/><br/>And so I think where those character are in the story this time around encourages the actors Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and especially Taylor Lautner to push their skills just a bit further. Whereas in the previous movies, they could easily remain in the comfort zone of a lovey dovey very generic love triangle, now they find themselves in a love triangle situation equipped with heavier complications and consequences. But if you think having an Oscar winning screenwriter Bill Condon in charge means having him rework Melissa Rosenberg's formulaic script, think again! Because the last thing on Condon's mind is to upset the fans. So the staring contests and the cheeesy unbearable, often unintentionally laughable dialogue are still there, it still feels like watching a teen soap opera with cinematic values, so everything that you'd expect from a Twilight movie, BREAKING DAWN has all of them, but I think what Condon managed to do is maintain the tone and set up a conflict that would lead to some kind of common ground, he also managed to approach certain risqué segments appropriately, keeping them within the boundaries of Bella's point of view, even the birthing process itself is done in a manner that allows you the audience to somewhat see what's going on through her eyes. Having Condon as the helmer allows the characters to offer more, thus allowing the actors to express a wider range of emotions, believe it or not.<br/><br/>The fans who've come to be swept away by this franchise's romantic weapons, so to speak, will not be disappointed. The lavish outdoor wedding and the rather funny toast speeches would get any Twi-hard to giggle and chuckle, not to mention the honeymoon in exotic Brazil with the ridiculously private exquisite vacation home, which serves as a role model for what honeymoons should be like. The production goes all out, spares no expense. Of course fans of action movies like yours truly would also expect a good fight between the vampires and the wolves, and that's exactly what I get from Cullens vs. Jacob's clan. If I were to take one thing that I'd consistently find truly impressive about this whole franchise is the VFX of some of the characters turning into wolves, that to me will always be the part that's pretty hardcore. Now they even digitally mess with Bella's weight which I think is one of this film's nifty treats."
"veronicatraveler","6","6","13","18 November 2011"," For fans of the book, well worth watching
","This latest chapter captures the emotions of the book and of this part of the characters' lives. Each event is fleshed out, from Edward's revealing again to Bella about the killings he has committed, Bella's apprehensive dreams, the Quiletes discussing imprinting, the feelings of all involved in the wedding, and most effectively, Edward's anguish as his loved one is slipping away. Edward has his most emotional scenes to date. Most of the special effects are done more convincingly than in the previous Twilight films. If you are looking for porn in the honeymoon scene, you won't find it; instead you will find sweetness and eroticism between two people who have waited for one another and are very much in love. A fitting beginning of the end for the saga."

","I read a review last night where the reviewer said, ""this movie is the highlight for the story."" I think this is a fair judgment. If you had read the book and loved it, then this movie will treat you greatly. It is made for the fans. Fans who know exactly how each conversation between the characters goes, so that they can use their imagination to fill in the gaps.Because there are gaps that I don't see how someone who has jumped the 'Twilight' wagon with this movie can possibly deal with. It was visually very pleasing. The wolves are back and very much in action (more than the books let them). I loved it; I was always one for the wolves. The breaking away of Jacob, the second alpha was interesting, though could have been done more interestingly. I liked the imprinting part. We also get to see glimpses of Renesme. I think they have done her justice.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was Bella's transformation. She is one damn pretty vampire.<br/><br/>Oh, and Stephanie Myer appears as one of the wedding guests, which I thought was a nice touch."
"Nilotica64","9","7","16","20 November 2011"," Bill did a good job
","I love the books and enjoy the movies. I felt they did a good job for the most part, the only scene I felt was real cheesy was the werewolf scene between Jacob and Sam. But how else would you do it? It was pretty much the was it was in the book. I understand why they had Jacob, Seth, and Leah in human form most the time, but missed how it was written. They had Bella looking so bad, but again that's how she was described. I would have liked a little more of the Rosalie and Jacob animosity, it was always so funny in the book, my favorite was the dog bowl scene, wish it was in the movie. Over all I enjoyed it very much and can't wait for the next one."

","Twilight, you love it or you hate it and I'm one that hate it. But I must say that this time I enjoyed some parts. Still, it do has a few boring parts. <br/><br/>I was happy that the glistening vampire was gone and that we really had a vampire this time to see. the part I enjoyed was when Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) had a dream of her wedding where they killed everybody. it looked so great and I was surprised by the amount of red stuff they used. On the other hand it's still clear to see that it is a flick for youngsters. the romantic scene in the water and after wards in bed were Bella is fully naked they really edited in that way that nothing was seen of her private parts and juggs. Kristen admitted that the shooting did had a few nudity shots but that the producers and director thought that it would be shocking and they wouldn't get their toddler rating. A bit the same what happened with Jennifer's Body (2009) where Megan Fox comes topless out of the water. But that's another story.<br/><br/>Once Bella becomes pregnant the movie becomes a bit enjoyable to watch and the boring situations and blah blah between Bella and Edward are on a hold. Jacob Black also has an important role and leaves his shirt on this time. Maybe they all have learned there lessons due spoofs and reviewers laughing with Twilight.<br/><br/>I do must give kudos to the special effects and in fact the part make-up where they transferred Bella into a sick and almost death person. She's skinny too (easy to spot in her bikini) which adds towards the looks of a sick person.<br/><br/>Naturally, all is predictable (no pun intended) and no surprises are to expect from this part. The end shot of Bella was one you could see coming miles away but please do watch the end credits when suddenly the Volturis are back into the game. They are the best looking vampires in Twilight. again, easy to spot what they are going to say.<br/><br/>Overall, it is still Twilight but like Harry Potter they are moving very slowly to darker regions.<br/><br/>Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

Robert pattinson,well he is a nice actor but his character has not really much to do in these movies.he portrayed his emotions well but his character looks cut down in front of Bella and Jacob. Taylor lautner,he is your usual Jacob you saw in previous twilight,although his shirtless scenes are less which might offend his fans.average job by him. conclusion: if you are a twilight fan,you are gonna like this movie still if not love. if you are not a twilight fan,you are still gonna enjoy it but scratch your heads as well."

","If you like the previous movies you will probably like this. But if you did'nt like the others then why even bother seeing this and argue about it being bad and so on???? Don't get that. I never se a move that I know i don't like, why should I??<br/><br/>Now over to the movie. I found it very good and I will definitely see it again. A little more predictable than the first three but for being the fourth movie in in a series, it was very good.<br/><br/>So my recommendation: <br/><br/>1 - If you like twilight, go see it. 2 - If you don't like Twilight, go see something else. 3 - If you have never seen twilight before, see the other three first and then follow step 1 or 2."

","I very rarely disagree with IMDb ratings but in regards to The Twilight Saga films I find myself at odds with the average score. Whilst this film is not a 10 it certainly is not below a 5. I feel comfortable giving it a low 7.<br/><br/>The film did feel slow in places, especially the first hour, but I think that was the director and screenwriter(s) driving home the fan favourite parts of the book plus introducing several characters for Part 2. <br/><br/>Acting was solid. Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick were fantastic and steal any scene they were in. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were both excellent. I felt Taylor did improve considerably in this installment. <br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable film, especially after the first hour. Plus the film sets everything up for the final film in the series.<br/><br/>I would pay little attention to the IMDb score. At the time of writing this it has a score of 4.7. As time passes its likely it will drop further. The unweighted average is 6.3. If you break the voting down further into a male vs female of all ages you will see a huge difference (roughly 3.5 vs 7.5).<br/><br/>I'll put it as simply as I can. If you did not enjoy at least 2 out of the last 3 Twilight films then its very likely you will not enjoy this plus it seems to help if you are female! <br/><br/>Please remember when voting there are numbers between 1 and 10 (36% voted 10 and 23% voted 1). If you think this is the worst or best film you have ever seen you need to watch many more films, for your worst I'd recommend starting with anything that Uwe Boll or Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer directed."
"carli-xo","7","5","11","22 November 2011"," The best Twilight movie so far!
","I'm not going to go crazy with a long review. Everyone knows what Twilight is and most people already know of they love it or hate it. As a die hard fan of the books I had high expectations for the movies. The actors have matured immensely since the first movie and in my opinion they played their characters *perfectly* in this movie. I was blown away with how accurate this movie was in comparison to the book. I only noticed a few small differences which would probably go unnoticed to a normal Twilight fan. I mainly wanted to write this review to tell the fans to ignore the haters. Most of the bad reviews that I read on IMDb sound and look like they are written by people who didn't even see the movie. I was impressed by this movie and if you are a fan of any of the previous movies you will thoroughly enjoy this one."
"rcrjsmith","10","9","24","18 November 2011"," Best movie yet, and most true to the story line of the book.
","**********SPOILER ALERT***********<br/><br/>I have been anxious to see this movie since the debut of Eclipse. I wanted to know how a book as amazing as Breaking Dawn with the craziness of a vampire to human marriage resulting in a 1/2 human 1/2 vampire child would play out.<br/><br/>The wedding is beautiful, the gown is beautiful, the groom is glowing he is so proud. Kristen does an amazing job of presenting a nervous bride who is suddenly sure of marrying her soul mate when she sees him standing at the end of the aisle.<br/><br/>The honeymoon is wonderful. I was amazed at the details and how true to the book this part was. It's not explicit, they are under covers for the majority of it and no frontal nudity. Would love to see the uncut version - maybe on DVD. They are happy and so in love. Edward is busy trying to distract Bella and keep her mind off sex after their first foray...she is busy trying to seduce her all-to-willing husband and finally wins. It was presented very true to the book and while some parts were skipped, the important ones were there. The morning after will make you laugh :) Once they realize she is pregnant we are swept into the intense portion of the movie.<br/><br/>Jacob's portion of the book could have used more attention, but since I have read the book many times I was not lost. I went with a friend who has not read any of the books and she was confused about a few things. Namely the imprinting and what the heck was going on at the lumber yard when the pack is arguing in their wolf form. <br/><br/>The problem for the younger crowd, and why my 11-year-old will need to wait for the DVD is the graphic nature of the birth scene. I am not complaining, because once again the movie is so true to the book. The baby is delivered via vampire teeth c-section. I also appreciated the description of the burning that Bella experiences through the depiction of the venom traveling through Bella's body.<br/><br/>Speaking of her body, Bella is very emaciated - think poster child for anorexia. There are many shots of her emaciated body - mostly clothed, but still pretty graphic. She then dies after the baby is delivered and with the special effects it's pretty convincing that Edward and Jacob are working on a corpse. <br/><br/>Condon adds a vampire vs. werewolf fight for viewing pleasure, but really the book touches on this after Bella wakes up. It's a bit different, but I understand why it was made this way. Jacob saves the day and we are left on the edge of our seats waiting for the next installment. <br/><br/>I was not disappointed - hope you enjoy it too! 10/10 Stars"

I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie , Kristen gave a very VERY strong performance.

"siderite","6","2","3","24 February 2013"," Not as bad as I thought, but really saying absolutely nothing
","I really wanted to see this movie so as to be able to make fun of it in full knowledge. And I really expected something awful. The thing is, it wasn't that bad. The actors were OK, the effects were OK, the production values were OK. Nothing above average, but certainly not something terrible. The only problem with the film that I could not get over was the story. It said absolutely nothing! A lot of young people talk about their feelings, prepare for The Breaking Dawn part 2, then the film ends.<br/><br/>So yeah, it is a pretty crappy feeling to wait an hour and a half for something to happen, then a woman gives birth in a creepy way (don't they all?) and the film ends with nothing to show for the lost time. And, as a spoiler, I did watch part 2 immediately afterwards and almost all of it was just the same. So, in my view, this is a single film with about two hours and a half of nothing, then some special effects, and then, again, a completely boring ending."
"MLDinTN","5","2","3","14 January 2013"," why was the final book made into two movies....
","hardly anything happens in this. So much of the honeymoon could have been shortened to make the final book one movie. Of course, I know it was for the mighty dollar, but can the people whom make these movies at least try to put out a good product.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes is the wedding and Jacob upset about it. Then the next third is Bella and Edward on their honeymoon in Brazil and the unnatural fetus. Then the last third is them back home and Bella is very sickly because the baby is killing her. And the wolves want the baby dead because it could be a danger to them. But they can't kill Bella while she is still human. And Jacob decides he would rather turn on his kind and do what he can to protect Bella.<br/><br/>And this is all the happens besides the very end where we have the birth. The whole book could have been made in a 2 and half hour movie with the birth happening half way through.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I just don't get the popularity of these movies. I haven't thought any of them are very good. I haven't read the books either. They must be a whole lot better. Well if you have devoted time to watch the other Twilight movies, then you might as well as see this one and final."
"GiraffeDoor","8","1","1","26 April 2020"," An even better love story than Twilight.
","I feel slightly foolish reviewing this since I sort of figure that if you sat through the first three movies then you're going to check this out sooner or later and if you haven't seen them, well ... ""saga"" is right there in the title.<br/><br/>But I was pleasantly surprised by this. I'm not a twi-hard but I think it's fair to say a lot of the more vocal hate hurled against this movie has an ulterior motive.<br/><br/>Throughout the series, there has always been that biblical undertone; that question of whether it's better to pursue transhuman power or maintain our humanity and it all finally comes to the boil in a pretty intense narrative of tribal conflict, belonging and challenging predicaments.<br/><br/>For the first time I think I can really feel what the fans feel about this story. The Saga can be a bit alienating to people who don't fetishize the central romance but with the groundwork thoroughly applied, Meyer's hard work pays off at least on screen. For me, the aesthetic value of a romance is limited by the development of the participants and as much as I like Bella Swan (I'd date her before Hermione, *shrug*) she and her Beau (see what I did there?!) have never really struck me as having much definition as characters except in terms of their relationship with each other (which was always a bit insta-lovey). But here the substance of the story shines through and it truly feels the part of that series you always wished you could have read as a kid.<br/><br/>The nuances of this ""miracle"" child, the character that always calls it a ""fetus"" in contrast to the one that insists it's a ""baby"" should be apparent to everyone. It leads us to an edgy situation of the conflict of supporting your loved one and avoiding the actions that may take them away from you. I was compelled.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, simmering tensions between bestiality and necrophilia, uh I mean...the werewolves and the vampires are pretty epic. In addition to a poignant rendition of someone's familial loyalty tested by doing what one feels is right we get to see that Jacob is way more than eye candy.<br/><br/>I think it reflects positively on the series that we open with a wedding on what is to all practical purposes the ""Final Chapter"". Harry Potter also did this curiously albeit to fairly peripheral characters. Popular culture has trained me to see a wedding of this kind as the natural conclusion to any epic series but here, the real challenges (as they often do in real life) begin after the vows have been exchanged.<br/><br/>So much of the first act is the marriage and honeymoon. It's strange how sitcomy the whole thing feels at times (or maybe whatever Hollyoaks is would be a better analogy), seriously, the ""let's do anything but bang"" montage was something I was totally not prepared for, complete with the chess-board of platonicalness.<br/><br/>But my girl Kristen looks fabuloso. She is radiant when she needs to be and vulnerable when she needs to. If your memory of Stewart is the first movie, well she has honed her craft and she is pretty breathtaking in this. And girl gets LAID!!! Too bad the playa hating censors had to neuter this picture but the director really makes the best of it. Seriously, the trivia says it was her thrusting that the issue. Never say a girl doesn't commit...<br/><br/>The rest is the eye popping blockbuster you'd expect. The production design, the convincing giant wolves, the stunning fights, all wrapped together in the Pacific Northwest Gothic aesthetic that Twilight has really made its own. The use of color and setting is actually quite majestic. The music is always on point, Carter Burtwell's Orestral (Danny who?) as well as the popular songs applied make every moment count, not just the wedding.<br/><br/>If there's one negative thing that remains in the mind, it's the CGI infant. But it's not as bad as everyone says it is.<br/><br/>People think of this series as trite young adult fiction because that's pretty much what it is. But that's not a bad thing, and this entry to the series really shows a saga that began as chocolate box romance blossom into something that's actually pretty impressive. The series has grown-up with its fan-base (well the movies have, I've only read the first one and its gender-flip) and managed that for more effectively than I felt Harry Potter did (no offense intended to the Potter heads reading, I can admit that I'm a low-key fan myself of specific parts). Cards on the table: I can barely remember what the third movie was even about. Is it about anything? There's a love triangle and the vampire council is mad at them for some reason and there's Dakota Fanning well past her prime..., really I DID see it...<br/><br/>But if for whatever reason you have not seen the other sequels and are reading reviews of this movie (we would get along), then I am inclined to say that you could do a lot worse than this. I never felt bored for a second of its 2 hour run time.<br/><br/>My Fascination with this series not withstanding, I am Tempted to say that you shouldn't Hesitate to enjoy the Revelations of this movie."

"Mrjake09","10","9","26","17 November 2011"," what's wrong with the critics ? they can't write one post without insulting the actors and the film !
","It was GREAT!! Probably the greatest after Twilight! 1. Bill's direction was the best, if not second best after Catherine's. 2. The script was definitely the best of them all. 3. Kristen gives the best performance of the four movies. From being nervous to get married, to being completely in bliss, to trying to keep her baby. She was phenomenal. 4. The sex scene were very very sensual but didn't go all the way to sexual. It was really good, I wasn't disappointed but I wanted more. I hope we get to see more on the DVD. I think the scene where they start to have sex for the second time was hotter than the actual sex scene. 5. I loved the scene with her in the black nightie! Rob was so funny. 6. I thought the wedding was going to be a big extravaganza, but it was actually somehow discreet, and very very sweet, especially in the vows and when they kiss after that it was amazing, and with the song playing! 7. A good surprise was the nightmare Bella's having before the wedding where she is dressed as a bride and everyone is wearing white. To be honest I liked the way she looked in the dream wedding more than the actual one. 8. The scene where they hear the baby for the first time and then they cuddle on the couch was the cutest scene ever!! Ever!!! And I loved the fact that they made it just about Bella and Edward and not with Rosalie and Jacob too, like it was in the book. It was an amazing moment! 9. I know we have all been waiting for the sex scene, but I think the birth scene eventually stole the show. It was really powerful and I found myself actually terrified and worried about what would happen even if I knew! Kristen looked completely terrifying and they had a lot of close ups at the scene where she is dead. Rob gave his best Twilight performance ever in that scene, where Bella dies. He was just desperate!! And you could see how desperate he was! He was mesmerizing!! And I loved it when he called her ""baby""! I thought it would sound wrong for Edward if he ever called her baby, but it sounded so right at that moment saying ""come to me baby please"" so desperately! 10. I loved the fact that they did not try to stick to the lines of the book. They did that in Eclipse. Months after seeing Eclipse I realized that it had a bad script, because they tried to bring the exact lines of the book to the movie. Fortunately that didn't happen in this one, so it gave more room to the actors to act better, all of them. I think we should congratulate Bill Condon not only for the direction but also for contributing and making a better script. 11. The toasts: funniest scene in the movie. Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick were hilarious!! And I loved how they showed that scene. One toast after the other. 12. The one scene I hated was the wolves talking to each other in their wolf form. Wasn't that weird? It was like robots trying to have a conversation.<br/><br/>Overall it's the most mature Twilight, and probably competes with the first one to be the best. To be honest I wasn't very satisfied with New Moon and Eclipse, they just never exactly did it for me. But with Breaking Dawn I was 100% satisfied and well done Mr. Condon! Very nice job!"
"IheartCali5882","7","5","12","27 November 2011"," The most grown up of the bunch.
","Even for those of you who flat out just don't like the Twilight franchise, this will be your highest rated of all 4 films. I've read the books which are vastly superior to the films, but so far I've enjoyed this one the most. You can tell the direction is much more sophisticated than in prior films. The original was my favorite until I saw BD, but I always thought they leaned towards teenage cheese fest. Breaking Dawn breaks away from the pack in what would still be a pretty decent film on it's own. Mind you it will never win any awards, but it's noticeably improved in direction, pacing, and yes acting. <br/><br/>Taylor Lautner is still as bad as ever, and the other 90% of the cast have minimal lines and opportunities to show off their abilities. And while Kristen Stewart is a decent actress in her other films, she's always been dreadfully bad in the Twilight franchise. But alas she was not altogether terrible in this one. I've had the chance to see Robert Pattinson in two other films, and he's a much better actor than the Twilight franchise gives him credit for. Given the chance he can come up with some pretty powerful stuff.<br/><br/>Aside from all that, the writers and director have really brought the film up to a higher level, relatively speaking. The pacing is a thousand times better than previous films. It just seems more organic than all the others. I can't say I enjoyed New Moon, Eclipse was just OK, and I did enjoy Twilight. BD surpasses all of them by far.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you're not a fan you're not going to enjoy this just like you didn't enjoy any of the others. However it's clear that this is the superior of the 4.<br/><br/>My rating: 6.5/10"

","I saw the midnight showing last night, and I will return to the theaters tonight to see the film again. From start to finish the film was surprising, funny, and warm. My husband was not into twilight but couldn't help but know about it, because of me. He didn't enjoy the first 2 films, but eclipse became his favorite. After watching Breaking Dawn last night, he best described it as a ""tender"" film. He felt the emotions, the comedy, and the display of Edward and Bella's relationship was ""warm and tender."" In his opinion it is his favorite film and now he can't wait until next year for part 2. I appreciate Bill Condon's respect for the series, you can't help but notice the passion and dedication he and the actors put into this film. I know part 2 will not disappoint. Not one actor fell short in presence on the screen. Taylor Launter and Robert Pattinson brought their A game, I could feel their emotions rolling off the screen, it was an intense experience watching them in action. Some characters that were 2d in other films of the series, got their moment in this film, Leah Clearwater was one that brought me to the brink of tears. When she said how lonely and unwanted she felt by everyone, paired with her expressions, my mind went back to eclipse after Jacob got hurt and everyone was huddled around Billy Black's house listening to Carlisle re-break his bones. Leah was on the outside of the circle, holding herself, looking in. It crushed me, lol I almost felt like I had abandoned her for not really noticing the character before. This film is worth seeing and it redeems itself from all the critiques of the past. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets at least an Oscar Nomination.

"damir_prebeg","5","3","6","3 February 2012"," All in all it's not that bad as some people say but...
","Again, I'm not so demanding viewer because if I like some idea behind the story, I tend to ignore bad things in the movie it self.<br/><br/>But one thing I can't ignore is that they have created two movies instead of one. And they have done that by stretching and creating too long and too boring scenes. Of course, they want to milk more money from real Twilight fans when part two hits theaters, but come on...<br/><br/>Although people are tending to blame acting, I think problem lies more in bad directing. For instance, Bella's wedding walk was one of the worst directed scenes in the whole movie. For a whole two minutes they made her look like she will throw up any moment.<br/><br/>And after a ""good night"" in Brazil... - Edward: ""I'm sorry, I've hurt you, I hate my self"". - Bella: ""No you didn't, I'm OK. I'm truly happy"". - Edward: ""No, I hate my self, you are lying"". - Bella: ""No I'm really OK."". - Edward: ""No, you are not"". - Bella : ""Edie, I am OK...?"". - Edward: ""UR lying..."" - Bella: ""...? Tell you what, let's play some chess until you stop wining, OK?"" - Edward: ""No, you are ly... uhm... sorry. I like chess""<br/><br/>But to cut the... you know what. I don't recommend this movie to be watched in the theater since you don't have ability to fast forward when needed. In the end, with working remote, I rate this movie with full 5 stars. Without it, I would say 2-3 stars tops."

","When I read Breaking Dawn for the first time I loved it. It was shocking and chaotic and I couldn't believe the author could take it in such a bizarrely perverse direction. But in no way did I think any of the novel's real gruesomeness would make it to the screen in the squeaky clean series. Well i'm happy to say that I was so off my game and happily so. Breaking Dawn pt. one is everything you have been hoping for in these adaptations. The characters are fully drawn finally with solid performances to match. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are at their best and Taylor Lautner is finally really good. The film is directed wonderfully by Oscar winner Bill Condon of Dreamgirls and Of Gods and Monsters. The film is always engaging, interesting, funny, clever and even a little terrifying. How this film escaped without an R rating I just don't know the sex scenes are pretty impressive but is nothing compared to the grotesque birthing sequence only briefly outlined in the book but much more effective here. The film is powered by potent melodrama as usual but it's much more effective this time around creating an atmosphere of utter suspense. Now there will no doubt be haters as usual, and maybe even more so because this is such a bizarrely perverse and darkly wonderful film. But it is without a doubt the best of the series and one of the best films I've ever seen. I'd also like to say that Kristen Stewart be commended for her utter dedication to the role. She looks sickly and completely immerses herself in it. It's quite striking with a film too match. Brilliant!"

","Breaking Dawn, Part 1 was MUCH better than Eclipse. I'm reading a lot of bad reviews, everybody is entitled to their own opinion and maybe the movie wasn't for them. I'm not a teenager and at first refused to have anything to do with a ""stupid movie about a stupid vampire that pretends to be a teenager."" Then one day out of sheer boredom rented Twilight on PPV was of course was hooked. And yes, females will enjoy this movie more as they are more in-tuned with the idea of falling in love and romance.<br/><br/>Most reviews complained about the amount of romance, hugging, kiss, etc. This movie is about the romance of a newly married couple. Most newlyweds do these activities, constantly. Sure, they are far from your average newlyweds. It was amazing to see Bella walking down the aisle looking like she was going to pass out at any second but whenever she saw Edward it was if she forgot to be nervous. There were cheesy moments and funny moments. Charlie's wedding speech was hilarious.<br/><br/>What amazed me was that they actually filmed the birth scene just like it was in the book. Being that the Twilight Saga has a pretty young fan base I wasn't sure how they would approach the issue of sex and childbirth. Especially a birth as abnormal as the one Bella had. I thought Bill Condon did a great job. You get romance, love, happiness, illness, horror and death all in under 2 hours.<br/><br/>It was kind of sad seeing Bella cleaned, dressed and fixed up just as though she were being laid out for a funeral. But the most amazing part of the whole movie was watching her body regenerate as the venom went through her veins. And when her eyes opened at the end, I knew then that I wouldn't be able to wait a year for the next one! Again, this movie may not be for everyone but most fans will appreciate it."
"kaidy330","10","7","20","21 November 2011"," I just like it
","I guess that most of the reviewers giving criticisms never read the book. Although this movie dropped a lot of stuffs in the book, at least it shows the most important parts of it. I can't think a better way to film the book. It contains a lot of thoughts and feelings which are very hard to present in a movie. But they have done their best. If you are looking for an action movie, just don't see this one. You can't blame the movie because there is no violence or actions in it, otherwise it is not twilight. I also like the soundtrack in this one, they adopted the original music from the first twilight movie, which is also my favourite in the series of twilight movies. Overall, I am glad the movie is going back to the romantic way and closer to the original book."
"somethingjenny","8","7","20","19 November 2011"," Forgive me...I actually really enjoyed this!
","I'm what you could call half-twihard. I loved the first two books, barely remember reading Eclipse and when it came to Breaking Dawn that book was one that (to quote Dorothy Parker), ""Should not be tossed aside lightly but thrown with great force"". I never even finished the 4th book it disgusted me so much.<br/><br/>At about 9:45 last night I bit the bullet and bought a ticket to the latest in this saga. I was half-expecting to walkout on this film as I had HATED the film Eclipse.<br/><br/>My first surprise was when I was in the sold-out theater and there were A LOT of women (and men) my age and older in the seats. I was expecting teen pandemonium but nope, I got thirtysomethings having a girl's (Moms?) night out. Whoops were kept to a minimum. I think some parents might be trying to protect their wee ones from this last movie. <br/><br/>Of course we had to watch 25 mins worth of previews beforehand, but I digress.<br/><br/>All that I had been dreading...actually kept me glued to the screen. The humor was present, whether intentional or not. Thank god for Billy Burke (Charlie Swan) to still be the comic relief in this film and keep it grounded in reality when there was time.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart has finally grown some confidence in her character, Bella, and for once, she didn't totally suck. She actually acted. How sad is that that I didn't like the lead until 4 movies into the saga?<br/><br/>There was implied rough sex, violence, and gore but NOT as gory as the birthing scene in the book. That I still haven't forgiven Stephanie Meyer for. Her way of writing of the birthing process would have scared me senseless if I was 12. In the movie, it worked.<br/><br/>The other thing I was dreading...how the heck are they going to pull off Jacob imprinting on Renesmee? I was shocked to see that was actually done well and it knocked all the previous pedophilia jokes out.<br/><br/>This movie is really only for the fans though. I can't imagine what a newbie would make of this series.<br/><br/>I won't be buying the soundtrack though. The score was fine and all but the artists they used did so not fit into my usual twilight playlist. It was jarring at times what they picked and just plain bad. New Moon still wins for best soundtrack, in my opinion, in capturing the mood of one of those films. That and there is no new Muse song out for this latest soundtrack (blasphemy!). Then again Neutron Star Collision was quite awful."

Well the first part of the book doesn't have a whole lot of fighting and the fight scenes that are in the movie didn't happen but I give the director credit for trying to reach out to the male fan bass. Over all they did an amazing job from getting the wedding to look exactly how it was described to making Bella look like a walking skeleton. Looking forward to watching part two :)"

","On November 21, 2008, we were introduced to a whole new world of the supernatural – vampires and the occasional love between a vampire and a mortal. Then the real battle began on November 20, 2009, when the were-wolves came out of the bag, literally and the ever-so-much killing spree of a notorious vampire who was determined to kill the mortal for beheading her mate. Then on June 30, 2010, that same vampire – Victoria, created an army to wipe the Cullen clan off the face of the earth and the supernatural world, but in the end death would meet her in the afterlife as she herself becomes ash and dust. Now we come to November 18, 2011, where the epic battle between what is right and what will be will come to an epic end in Part 1 of the 2-part phenomenal and mesmerizing conclusion to the story of a love that will last into eternity. It all started with a longing, and it will end in happiness. To the creator – Stephanie Meyer, thank you so much for an incredible journey of love, passion and heart – you have given us something that we can cherish for the rest of our lives."

","Anyone who doesn't think this film was a home run, either isn't a fan of the series or just doesn't have an ounce of romance in their body. This absolutely was the second best yet (Twilight being the first). Bella and Edward's journey couldn't have been shown any different and Bill Condon went right to the heart of it and did a brilliant job of bringing it to fruition. This movie will be seen by this fan at least a half dozen times or more. The emotion and sacrifice and love they brought to Bella and Edward were what had me reading Breaking Dawn over and over. I have always loved seeing and reading about epic love stories and this one, by far, has exceeded all expectations. Bravo!"

","I thought this was an amazing movie. :') I laughed, cried, laughed some more, looked away, cried some more, my best friend and I were terrified at times, knowing full well what was coming....oh, it was perfect! It played out on screen exactly as it looked in my head while I was reading it and re-reading it. Been a Twihard since 2009 and I must admit, my passion for this romance couldn't be stronger.<br/><br/>**LIL SPOILER** The music/soundtrack is what hit home for me. Thank you so much for bringing us back to the original ""Twilight"" movie. :') What an amazing touch. You could have introduced something newer, more hip, more mind-blowing, etc...but instead.... it all just came full circle for me. Cannot wait to own this movie and see Part 2."
"swolfcg","8","5","13","18 November 2011"," Breaking Dawn Steps it Up
","So, I went to see the new Twilight movie this afternoon, and I have to say it has to be the best of the bunch. I'm truly not a Twittard or whatever you call those sad moms who wear Edward tees and scream Robert Pattinson's name whenever they catch the fancy, but I thought it was overall one of the best productions in this franchise thus far.<br/><br/>The acting was much better by Kristen Stewart, who I'd previously judged to be a good child actor and a sub-par to bad adult actor. Direction, editing, and comic relief was also a step-up as well. I was pleasantly surprised with the lightheartedness and obvious demonstration that they truly don't take themselves too seriously, especially with the more ridiculous parts that most book fans rejected. Case in point, Bella's questionable baby name choices.<br/><br/>I was a bit shocked by what they did end up showing their mostly pre- teen audience, but I think they did stay true to the book as much as possible. The true test on whether this was entertainment gold for me is the amount of times I caught myself glancing at my watch or being distracted by the odd passerby. Test passed, and was I was actually kinda PO'd that it ended when it did, even though I already knew they were splitting the last book up into two movies. The worst part of this movie, as you can imagine, is that we now have to wait another year to watch the rest. Oy' vey, but I'm sure it will be well worth the wait, or as Roger Ebert so elegantly puts it, if it isn't, Charlie Swan has a gun and he knows how to use it."
"hassan_kulsoom","10","6","17","24 November 2011"," Best Twilight Movie Yet!
","For people that are not Twi-Hards this movie would seem really bad and dull. But for those that are Twi-Hards, like me, they would LOVE this movie! It was almost exactly the same as the book, though there were some scenes added and replaced/removed. I'm glad that there were some scenes(such as Bella getting 2 cars from Edward) that they didn't show. Some scenes from the book just seemed so pointless.<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVED what they did with the wedding! It was really heart touching and it was so much better than the book's wedding scene. I loved how Bill Condon added the wedding speeches (especially Charlie's and Jessica's). The speeches brought a lighthearted humor towards the scene.<br/><br/>The honeymoon was a bit graphic, but was pretty close to how the book described everything.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the transition from a lighthearted movie, to an extremely dark and somewhat horror like film. I think that Kristen Stewart did an amazing job acting in this movie, so much better than in the other three. The make-up they did on her and the special effects put on her were really good and she seemed really fragile, like she could break and die at any minute, as it was meant to be. Very effective!<br/><br/>The wolf scene where Jacob confronted Sam was a bit of a stretch, I have to say, but the CGI on the wolves was pretty awesome, they seemed pretty real. I absolutely LOVE Seth's character, he's such a cutie! The birth scene was so intense, and, even though I have read the book and knew what was going to happen, I still cried seeing how hard Edward and Jacob were trying to save Bella. Jacob crying was absolutely intolerable, I could not stop crying, since I absolutely love the character and Taylor Lautner's acting in the films.<br/><br/>I have got to say, the effects that they did on Renesmee were a bit off, but she was such a cute baby! The whole future that they showed with Jacob and Renesmee was pretty awesome, I loved how they showed their future and who Renesmee would become afterwards, and how Jacob would do anything for her.<br/><br/>The fight between the wolves and the Cullens was not in the book and was not meant to happen, so I thought it was kind of unnecessary, but it was nice how Jacob stopped the wolves from attacking Renesmee. It was also nice how Edward seemed so unsurprised/angry when he found out and told the others of how Jacob had imprinted on Renesmee and that it was the worst thing to do if you killed a pack members imprintee. Cullens about the law the wolves have that they can't kill another wolves imprintee. I thought he would be a bit more furious that he imprinted on his daughter, but I liked this part of Edward.<br/><br/>The ending (not going to reveal what it was) was a good shock, but that was also the same way that I had imagined it would end, that kind of cliffhanger worked really well for those people that read the books and for those who hadn't.<br/><br/>OK, for those of you who haven't watched it yet, DO NOT leave right when the credits start rolling. There is a special little scene after a few minutes of the credits. I regret not staying and I had to watch it on YouTube later that day."

","Words can not describe how great the movie is. <br/><br/>I didn't have highest expectations, But I can definitely say that the directer did an amazing job and the acting is so much better. Of course the first film is always best.. But now after seeing breaking dawn, New Moon And Eclipse were very disappointing. The thing I liked the most is how little things from Twilight (first movie) was also used in breaking dawn, like the music and a little montage it kind of gives closure to the story. <br/><br/>I'm not a hardcore fan but the twilight sage will always have a special place in my heart. Even though you think the book is stupid, don't be so harsh. Give it a chance you never know you might like it."

","Okay so yes there are plenty of haters out there and what I would like to ask them is why are you going to see this movie if you hate the franchise so much??? No one is being forced from where I am standing.<br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised I thought the wedding was tastefully done and the romance just right. The honeymoon was much more than I expected after hearing how the wedding night scene was cut to meet pg13 standards.<br/><br/>The three leads were the best in the series so far, strong performances all round with clear evidence of a good director and someone who actually took time to understand the story and know what the audience wanted. Well done Bill Condon.<br/><br/>For almost two hours I was swept away into a fantasy world where the vampires sparkle and the werewolves talk. The easiness of one Mr Pattinson on the eye helps but I still think the film was well worth the wait and did justice to what could have been a very awkward version of a book being translated to film."
"codboy333","10","18","69","12 November 2011"," epic !!
","I don't usually review twilight titles although I'm one of the biggest fans Like many others, I'm a twilight fan and i've loved every single movie released. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn part 1 is the most unforgettable, remarkable, and amazing movie out of the four , Breaking Dawn beats twilight , new moon and eclipse together , in my opinion its the greatest Twilight film . I would never complain about how the movie did not have enough 'details' because that it just something impossible to do without exceeding the runtime and also losing many audience who haven't read the book. By far, this is the greatest movie based on the Twilight series and after seeing this, one feels proud to have stuck with Twilight till the end. Watch it over and over again. It deserves nothing less. Bill Condon did an amazing job in this movie. rate +A"
"TheReviewPerson","7","4","10","26 November 2011"," With no doubt, the best of the series so far! It was seemingly impossible to pull off, but they've done it! (NOT WITHOUT FLAWS, THOUGH!)
","I must admit: I am a little bit of a Twilight fan, but I'm reviewing this on both accounts. Firstly: The actors have obviously had a kick up the backside and told to just get better at acting! One of the things that really irritated me about the rest of the series was the acting (especially Kristen's), but, I am extraordinarily happy to say that everyone has improved a lot! Although, I did think that Edward could have been a little more 'guilty' and Jacob a little less content with Bella's situation. The wedding scene was fantastic, and although I'd heard many people say that it's a sweet scene, I never expected it to be THAT good! It was believable, and the humour was funny NOT because it was cheesy, but because it generally related to the characters, and their actions. (I must congratulate Billy Burke on his fantastic performance!) I thought that Taylor Lautner did very well when he thought Bella was dead, and to those who didn't know that Bella DOES survive, probably found that quite moving. In fact, I did, too. I also thought that Kristen did a good performance with the 'on-the- verge-of-hyperventilating-so-must-calm-down' scene in the honeymoon. Secondly: I loved the little details that were included, such as, having Stephanie Meyer as a cameo, and the fact that Edward and Bella played chess in the honeymoon. It was the little things like that made me smile! Thirdly: The sets, the scenery, and the effects were better than ever! Most of the film was exactly how I'd imagined it, and my friends agreed! Fourthly: I thought that the wolf-mind-thought-talking thing was funny. And not in a good way. I did wonder how they would pull that off without making it comical, and they didn't! I got 'sshhh!'ed quite a lot from laughing so much! However, the growling scene effects were undoubtedly very, very good! Fifthly: The soundtrack was the best so far, and obviously had a lot of thought put into it. I'm definitely buying that off iTunes! Lastly: Stay behind at the end because there is a 2-minute short after the credits! -----BUT----- Non-Twilight fans will be bored out of their socks, I am sorry to say."
"robertpattinson6453","9","4","10","25 November 2011"," I loved every bit of Breaking Dawn
","I think Bill Condon did a terrific job. It's also the bloodiest, most gruesome, squirm-inducing entry in the series thus far. And Kristen Stewart portrayed the perfect Bella. Breaking Dawn is about Bella and Edward's love story and their intense passion for each other. Ones who think that the movie wasn't good. Well.uh, one advise. Please read the books first. The beginning of the end ultimately delivers a wow factor. And I loved Rob and Kristen's acting. And yes I was in tears at the end of birth scene. yeah about lesson twilight gives. Yeah it shows love, passion and dedication for your partner. The support your family gives you. Bella's intense love for the child who was killing her. Friendship... Its just that now this world is full of hatred that you guys have developed. yeah what does hating TWILIGHT could possibly give you?"
"rudowskia","7","4","10","22 November 2011"," Good enough, to make me want to see it again.
","I noticed that the rating for this movie is less then 5 stars. I was very surprised because I thought it was very good. Of course there was some bad parts in it, like having her constant nightmare in the beginning of the movie instead of the honeymoon like in the book and the dream was different, I didn't really like that. Also I thought the first 45mins of the movie were poorly done, I didn't like the acting or the lines, I was very disappointed. But it wasn't THAT BAD, I really enjoyed the birthing scene because it was exactly the way I imaged it while reading the book. Also I really loved the way they incorporated Jacob breaking away from the pack."
"belbe_dj","8","4","10","22 November 2011"," finally another close approach to the book
","OK, I know many people for some reason didn't like this movie but i don't see how. i was thrilled to finally see almost exactly what i had imagined. perhaps they just imagined differently? Aside from the first movie, this one was the closest to the books they've done so far. Only thing I would've changed would be the wolf mind chatter a bit less unrealistic (those synthesized voices are sooooo 3rd category dumb movie), and the part where Bella is in agony and can't move because of the drugs could've been emphasized as much as it was in the book. All in all, the core of the first half of this book was romance, drama and horror. They did OK with the romance (Rob and K are so comfortable with each other that some of the tension that made them stand out wore off), perfect with the drama (gotta take my hat off to Kris and the guy who plays her father, they were Awesome!) but were a little sloppy on the horror, perhaps due top the damned PG13 rules.<br/><br/>oh and dialogues! they should've allowed for more improvisation. Some sentences clearly were forced on the actors and don't suit them at all.<br/><br/>but despite all I loved the movie, it was exactly what I expected ;)"
"her_majesty_mirela","5","4","10","21 November 2011"," A visual companion to the book...maybe?
","If you are a Twi-hard fan who has been satisfied with the movies so far, you will love it. However if you are someone like me who is a fan of the books but struggles to enjoy the movies, you will definitely still have those same issues. This movie sticks closest to the book. Most scenes follow the book very closely both script wise and visually. With the other movies certain things weren't always the way the book would describe them to be, but with ""Breaking Dawn 1"" they've definitely done well with sticking to the story. Bill Condon has done an excellent job directing and the score has finally gone back into Carter Burwell capable hands. So if you loved the score from the first movie, you'll get those tingles all over again as Bella's lullaby plays in the background of some of the best scenes. The soundtrack is OK, no songs by Muse this time around though which I found to be a shame since they're a great band and have contributed to the previous soundtracks. However, one of the favorites from the first movie makes a comeback to accompany a beautiful, if not the most beautiful scene in the entire movie. The wolves also look good, though I found them to look a little ""obviously fake"" in a couple of scenes, but it is definitely not something that will take away from the quality of the film. I expected better action scenes considering how much money these movies make. All the action scenes are night scenes so the shots are really dark and hard to make out. It's not like they needed to ""watch the budget"".<br/><br/>On that note, I will now share what I didn't like about the movie. My biggest issue is still the same one that I've had since I saw the first movie: Kristen Stewarts performance as Bella. I have always had a problem with the way she portrays this character but I had hoped that with this movie she would get better because it is full of some serious emotional stuff. She not only under delivers in this movie but she really takes the magic out of it. Her performance is stiff, wooden, emotionless and annoyingly bland. It's basically Kristen playing herself instead of the beautiful character of Bella Swan. The script has given her some fantastic lines and emotionally gut wrenching material which she simply didn't deliver. The only scenes that worked in her favor are in the second half of the movie and that's because of the fact that they did a great make up job and she lost enough weight to look convincingly sick throughout the pregnancy. I have seen Kristen Stewart in other movies too and I just think that this girl is a very weak actress. It's a real shame because Bella is a great character in the books. Pattinsons performance is extremely disappointing in this movie. I think that he is a good actor but his best performance was probably in the first movie. It's since gotten weaker and weaker. Although he's performance is not the strongest, he is still believable as Edward. The actor who has improved the most and gotten better in every installment is Taylor Lautner and that's pretty hard for me to admit because I thought that he wasn't a good choice for Jacob at the start. Out of the three main characters Taylor is the most convincing. So I have to give props to Taylor as he is the strongest link in this movie with Kristen being the weakest. I also do not understand why they keep changing certain Cullens members hair styles and hair colors from bad to worse in these movies. OK Alice's hair is definitely spot on in this installment and the closest to the way it's described in the book. Emmet's and Esme's is too. Carlisle's and Jasper's however is awful. They have orange hair and really bad hair dos. Edwards hair is terrible. I will never understand why they changed his look so drastically from the first movie. He looked the way Edward is described in the book in the first movie. The hair was perfect and they also plucked and tamed Roberts eyebrows in the first film giving him that ""out worldly beauty"" that Edward is supposed to have. In this movie he's eyebrows are about three inches thick and his hair style is not even close to the way Edwards hair is described. The worst hair award definitely goes to poor Nikki Reid who plays the most stunning girl in the Cullen family, the irresistibly beautiful blonde, Rosalie. OK, her hair is not even blonde in this part!!! Seriously? It's a disgusting shade of dark gray and that is really confusing because her hair looked great in the last film, Eclipse. She also got robbed material wise. She barely has two lines in the movie even though she's one of if not the most predominant supporting characters in the book. Real shame too because Nikki's a good actress and there is some great interaction between Rosalie and Jacob in the book that they've sadly left out of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought that the birth scene was well done considering that they had to take it down to PG13 standards. The last 10 minutes of the movie are amazing and set the bar very high for ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"". I have to give Bill Condon props for doing a great job directing. Definitely did the best job out of the directors, shame he wasn't on board from the beginning. <br/><br/>I trust him to wrap up this story beautifully."
"pilotom","9","4","10","21 November 2011"," Perfect for Twiligters
","OK - this movie is NOT going to get an Oscar. It is not going to go on any official list of best movies ever made. However, if you loved the books, this film will likely hit the spot for you. The Twilight novels are largely cerebral. There is some action and adventure but the meat of the story is what's going on in the characters' heads - their emotions, their relationships, their senses. This is all hard to translate into film and I think this movie does a great job of doing that. There are scenes that could come across as corny or too maudlin. The film makers do a terrific job of re-interpreting those scenes (the honeymoon for one) with just the right touch of humor. This isn't the movie to see if you want to see some potential Academy award film but if you enjoyed the books and want to see the story come to life, pack up your sense of humor, leave the mighty expectations at home and just have some fun watching Bella finally get her vampire!"

","I was half looking forward and half not looking forward to seeing this film. After New Moon I was skeptical. But Breaking Dawn was the best book out of the saga. So I went with an open mind. Honestly I wouldn't have gone to see it only my friend is a total ""Twi-hard"". Its starts off with Jacob receiving an invitation to Bella and Edward's wedding,this angers him and he runs off into the forest. The wedding itself,I have to admit, was beautiful.Then the happily married couple set off for the honeymoon and they have a lovely,romantic time.Then it all goes pear-shaped. The good points of this film were as follows: The soundtrack was very good and suited the atmosphere totally.The scenery was breathtaking. Now for the bad points:I don't care what anyone says neither Kristen Stewart nor Robert Pattinson can act.Not many of the cast can.Also it was cheesy in parts.Many parts.<br/><br/>Still overall it certainly was not the worst of the saga and it is not the best. If you're not an absolute fan of it then you're not going to enjoy it."

","To be honest, I am a twihard. I've read every book and seen every movie so far. I can memorize pieces of the book by heart and the cast as well. However, this movie just didn't cut it even for somebody like me. After watching Harry Potter's thrilling finale, I expected something similar from this. But I guess I set my standards to high. From the opening scene with Bella's voice in voice-over I knew it was not going to meet the standards I have set for it. It is true that my standards are a bit high but it was not even close. The acting needed a lot of improvement. From Kristen Stewarts' lifeless voice and Robert Pattinson's emotionless face everything was just off. And don't even get me started on Taylor Lautner. Of course he is still as attractive as he always was but that whinny obnoxious personality can get a bit annoying. For the rest of the vampire covens, most of their performances were just standing as still as a statue, eyes wide open and having the same 'i might kill you' look on their faces. Of course this is what they're supposed to look like but having that as your only appearance? Let's get real here people. And for people who have never read the books? Well you'll be in for something more confusing the Inception. My mom, sitting next to me in the movie had to lean over and whisper to me every other scene ""what's going on?"". Their lack of sequencing was confusing at some times even for me. This movie didn't meet my expectation and really, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
"dianmond","10","6","18","20 November 2011"," Exactly as I've seen it between the lines...
","I always thought I am among the fans of Meyer's book rather then the Saga movies. I have been thinking this way till today... My opinion has been changed by the director that made a huge job to vitalize the final book of the Saga. Of course, the movie doesn't reflect it in details, but there is no need in it. More precise conformity with the author would kill the film. Actually, the movie is a more reality-like version of the book then I could imagine. I was smiling while reading in previous reviews: ""Bella looked terrible"" and ""the scene of Renesme's delivery was horrible"" ... Only innocent or very young people that have never gave a birth or seen the act of delivery could write those words. Bella was lucky because it was horrible and very quick. Not many woman can consider themselves lucky cause in reality it IS horrible and VERY VERY long...and you have no fashion-magazine-cover-look at that moment.))"

I am a major Twilight fan, and I have read all the books, so I was blown away with what they managed to do with this movie. It obviously had to be rated PG-13, and I truly believe that they couldn't have done any better with the rating that they had to work with. It was perfect. The acting did seem way better than it has before, especially with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. Their chemistry is HOT! They are definitely believable as a married couple in love. I think this is the best performance that Kristen has ever done in the series. Her deteriorating state during Bella's pregnancy, and the love she has for her unborn baby, as well as for Edward is so strong. I have never seen her better. She shined in this movie. Rob's acting was phenomenal, also the best I've seen in the series. He shows how broken Edward is about Bella's health during her pregnancy, and how it is torturing him. He shows Edward as finally giving emotions, from happy, to sad and broken, the emotion was clearly there. The birthing scene was EPIC!!! Totally amazing! And the way that it ended, I called it!

"brchthethird","6","3","7","13 November 2014"," Mildly enjoyable in a ""so bad it's good"" way
","At this point it is futile to quibble about the lack of character development, wooden acting and cliché dialogue. This doesn't make me some ""Twi-hard"", but I did find some enjoyment in this installment due to the utter ludicrousness of the plot and some truly hilarious moments. The first 30 minutes concerns itself with Edward and Bella's nuptials, and this was probably the worst part of the whole movie due to some extremely cringe-inducing, cliché-ridden dialogue. However, after that we get treated to the honeymoon which explores (in a chaste, PG-13 way) what it would be like for a vampire to have sex with a human. They don't just bang the headboard, they break the entire bed (technically, Edward does but whatever). Then, what follows is one of the most inexplicable pregnancies since the Virgin Birth, and seems to making a case against abortion. Admirable, but misguided. Anyway, the conflict that ensues over this vampire baby makes for some of the more melodramatic moments in the film. Obviously not competently handled, but interesting enough to watch unfold. However, the way in which it is resolved is head-scratchingly bizarre, yet completely expected if you've been paying attention before. I think that the only creepier thing than Edward grooming Bella for vampire-dom is Jacob imprinting on Renesmee, who is literally a baby. It couldn't get any more pedophilic than that, in my opinion. And somehow, because of the immutable werewolf law this solves the problem. Ridiculous, but kind of funny still. There's also a cheeky, yet ominous mid-credits scene which sets up the inevitable finale to come (but didn't Bella's eyes opening again already do that?). Anyway, the filmmaking quality here is the best yet in the series, with excellent cinematography and visual style to spare. Overall it's less awkward and overly ""teenage"" than its predecessors, probably due to the maturing of the subject matter. Flawed, but enjoyable enough for fans of the series."

Next year's counterpart will close out the teen-vampire love story based on the popular books by Stephenie Meyer.<br/><br/>The series centers around high school girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) who falls in love with Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a 108 year old vampire teen. He lives with his own vampire family, which doesn't prey on humans. They're the good guys. <br/><br/>Naturally, any human-vampire romance isn't without complications, especially if you're an angsty teen. There's Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), who is part of clan of shape-shifting werewolves: sworn enemies to vampires with extreme prejudice against the Cullens. <br/><br/>Complicating matters is Jacob's love for Bella and his intense hatred of Edward. What girl wouldn't want a love triangle between herself, a walking undead teen who sparkles in the sunlight and an uppity canine shapeshifter who spends much of his time sulking around shirtless? ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" opens with the marriage of Bella and Edward. Jacob is heartbroken and upset. He's deeply concerned for Bella's safety in both a physical sense (as a wedding night with a vampire could be dangerous) and for her eternal soul, should she become a vampire which would be inevitable in this kind of union.<br/><br/>Bella and Edward's Rio de Janeiro honeymoon is probably everything a teen girl's fantasy could be: luxurious location, a secluded tropical getaway and a beautiful full moon over the ocean as our young lovers finally consummate their relationship. I really admired the photography of the South American country and the attention to art direction for this part of the movie. It's a nice representation of complete wish-fulfillment in a ""happily ever after"" kind of way.<br/><br/>Then things take a turn. Against all odds, Bella is now pregnant with a human-vampire hybrid. In a daring move, she decides to keep the baby and refuses to consider the adverse effects on her health and life. What's interesting to note in ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" is the fact Bella is carrying a baby whose very existence is the crux of the story. Sure, Bella's life is at great risk, but it's about the consequences of having the baby or not. I'm reminded of movies like ""Alien"" where an unknown creature gestates inside a human host and bursts through their chest upon coming to term. Another scene that has potential horror flick connotations is when a local Rio de Janeiro demon expert puts her hands on Bella's tum-tum to determine the length of the pregnancy. At that moment, I'm channeling John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) where the guy defibrillating the other guy has his hands bitten off at the wrists by ""The Thing"" when the other guy's ribcage opens.<br/><br/>Those horror movie clichés are inconceivable in the Twilight world. As far as everyone is concerned, it's only a matter of whether Bella's going to have this baby or not. That's the big dilemma: not only for the Cullens, but also for Jacob's werewolf clan which is hell-bent for war over the whole affair. Why they even care, I'm not quite sure. Something about protecting humans and abominations coming to life, I gather. <br/><br/>What I've never understood about these movies is why everyone makes a big deal out of everything. Bella's decided to have the baby. She's in dire straits with a complicated pregnancy while everyone fights and yells around her over it. But hey, that's the Twilight universe for you. Everyone has to get huffy and puffy over matters which others would handle with more maturity. Can someone explain to me how Edward, who's more than 100 years old, has the cognitive reasoning of an adolescent with his knee-jerk reaction to Bella's pregnancy? So much for marital support.<br/><br/>Interesting to note: the film, where Bella carries a child of great significance like a vampirical Virgin Mary, is drawing heat for her wanting to keep her baby. Natalie Wilson of the ""Ms."" magazine blog criticized the film for a ""latent anti-abortion message."" Sandie Angulo Chen of ""Moviefone"" saw the film as ""one long pro-life debate. In contrast, John Mulderig of the ""Catholic News Service"" praised the ""strongly pro-life message being conveyed via Bella's unusual plight,"" saying it ""presents a welcome counterpoint to the all-too-frequent motif in popular entertainment whereby pregnancy is presented as a form of disease or an almost unbearable curse.""<br/><br/>Well, think what you will of ""Breaking Dawn Part 1."" I know I did, though I'm not the film's intended audience. I appreciated the film's craft, yet, like its predecessors, the dialog is utterly hokey and the character interaction is preposterous. I guess these observations are things best left alone here. The ""Team Edward"" and ""Team Jacob"" minions would not have it any other way. I'm sure this film will be heralded by their legions. That's fine. It's their call to make. I have mine too: Netflix and ""Team Sookie!"" (""True Blood"")."
"kingcassady","Null","5","15","18 November 2011"," Chilling, Beautiful, Intense, and repulsive...This Film is GENIUS.
","I had a lot of hope in this movie and last week when the reviews started to come out my enthusiasm went down loads as it was being trashed. In no way was Breaking Dawn my favorite book, that was definitely Twilight or Eclipse, but Bill Condon gave me hope and when I saw the reviews I lost a lot of faith in him. Now let me tell you I went into the theater extremely worried...IT WAS AMAZING. <br/><br/>Now I still think Eclipse was the best one. But everything I loved about Twilight was in this. The awkward but cute Edward and Bella moments, the cinematography, and the whole entire set was great. The movie starts with Bella getting ready for her wedding and soon enough the time has come and she's speeding her way down the isle for Edward. The movie takes off to Isle Esme, which by the way was absolutely beautiful, and they repeatedly make out and have sex. <br/><br/>Now this was what I considered the first half, and the worst half, of the movie. Not that it was bad but it could have been edited very much so. Although, I did enjoy that flashback scene of Edward at the movies...that was interesting. Now part 2 of the film is where I finally saw some awesome things. The acting was top-notch, never had I ever felt Bella that much. <br/><br/>Edward was in-pain, but the scene where he hears Reneseme's thoughts was soo cute. And I loved all the wolf-pack stuff which I thought I'd hate, but some of the stuff was actually pretty neat. I LOVED the wolf pack scene where Jacob leaves the pack. It's really, really amazingly directed although the voices were kind of annoying. <br/><br/>But it was the birth scene that had my stomach curling and it was when I officially realized how brilliant the movie really was. The way it made you feel, repulsive and sick, it was just perfect. And then the ending when Bella was transforming there may or may not of have been tears in my eyes. SO WONDERFUL. <br/><br/>Overall, there were some flaws like the lack of Leah and Seth who were key parts to the novel. And I do think some of the wedding could have been cut out. I never liked Ashley Greene as Alice, but she did a terrible job in this film. Could not get myself to like her as Alice at all in this one. <br/><br/>The movie was funny especially the cute toast scene, all the honey moon scenes were beautiful, the pregnant stuff was super intense, the wolf pack was finally just how I pictured it to be like, and finally the birth scene was just pure brilliance. <br/><br/>Thank you Bill Condon. 8.5/10"

","the movie is pretty entertaining!!

"Crstlx69","9","4","11","26 November 2011"," As a twilight fan I love it!
","I say love because I really want to see it again and again. <br/><br/>I felt like Jacob and Edwards acting was awesome. I was moved to tears a few times. <br/><br/>Aside the fact that the wolves talking to each other sounded like something out of power rangers, it was amazing. The way Jacobs imprinting was portrayed, the Birth scene, how the memories of all of the other movies and even Bella's child hood was showed, how they included songs from the first movie for example how they danced together at their wedding and the song that played when they were at the prom dancing together for the first time. Jacob breaking down when Bella was dead drew a tear to my eye that actually rolled down my cheek. And the fight between the Cullen's and the wolves was crazy! <br/><br/>Any twilight fan would know exactly what this movie would be like. I was expecting a slow start with a long honeymoon. I wasn't expecting the male leads to carry Kristen Stewart, who isn't that great an actress in my opinion, so effortlessly through the movie. It's been awhile since I read breaking dawn so I forgot about the drama between the wolves and vampires. But I enjoyed breaking dawn for jogging my memory. <br/><br/>I agree that they should have made the whole book one movie. I don't want to wait another year to see the last movie! <br/><br/>By the way HARRY POTTER IS ITS OWN MOVIE. I am a Fan of the Harry potter movies also. You just can't compare the 2! I'm tired of people acting like they are all the same. Twilight is about vampires Harry potter is about wizards. Get over it!"
"fallyhag","5","4","11","19 November 2011"," Entertaining and well directed
","This movie appears to be the victim of the ""hate Twilight mob"", which is a similar mob to the anti-X-Factor bunch (to which I belong) who will do and saying anything as long as it throws a negative view over it. The current IMDb of 4.0 (dated 19/11/11) is laughable and once again makes you question the credibility of the IMDb rating system. Anyway...<br/><br/>I can understand why the Twihards like this but to be honest I thought the films leading up to this one were quite poor. Not very well made at all. OK to watch but not great examples of films as they should be. I have just watched Breaking Dawn Part 1 and I am happy to say that it is so much better. I am not a Twihard but I found this film well made, entertaining, enjoyable, pleasant on the eye and imaginative. OK OK, I don't want to exaggerate it, it is not Oscar material (apart from Bella's makeup), but it is a good film. I have rated it at 7.0 because I honestly believe that is what it truly deserves.<br/><br/>Yes the story is nonsense, but come on, it is about vampires and werewolves. What do you honestly expect? But the director has done a very good job of translating the book to film (in my wires opinion). <br/><br/>So let me break down my thoughts on it as I remember them....<br/><br/>The film starts very fast. Slightly too fast. But I suppose there is a lot to cram in and before you know it we are into the wedding scene. The wedding is a good mixture of looking good, humour and drama. This flows into the honeymoon section where we were shown some lovely scenes. The romantic section was done very well and with taste. I personally thought the balance was just right here. Not too loaded with skin or uncomfortable holds etc..<br/><br/>The honeymoon scene is where the main storyline is created. Everyone must know what happens here but I will not mention it. But the way it was introduced was good and the pace was just about right. This sections effectively puts Bella's makeup artist on the Oscar nominee list. Her gradual transformation is incredible. I assume it is all just makeup and lights...I couldn't see any clunky CGI. If it was CGI then they will no doubt get awards too. But the closing scenes with Bella have you seeing her in an amazing transformed state that simply makes the scenes what they are. Very impressed.<br/><br/>The werewolves are considered the Marmite with this series of films. You either love or loathe the CGI. I have always accepted the CGI and bought into it and this film was no different. What I found better was the better direction and introduction of better mood music. The section on the log beach should have been stupid but I found it very powerful. More credit to the director. <br/><br/>So what stood out that I didn't like? The lack of continuity in the whiteness of the faces kept grabbing my attention. Very minor though. The thing that I really didn't like was the CGI on the baby's face. It just appeared to be a little clumsy and obvious. But this was only for a nano-second so I may be judging harshly. But it could have been better.<br/><br/>Rather than waffle on, I hate long reviews, I will sum it up. The film starts fast. The story represents the book very well. The direction is good and the makeup is excellent. The build up to the climax is well balanced and the film went very fast (despite its long running time). The way this film ends is spot on and does leave you wanting to know what happens next. I enjoy watching good films and I know what is rubbish when I see it. But I can safely recommend this film to you with the only caveat of ""remember what you are going to see"" before you rush in and judge it harshly. I recall all the rubbish that has been pumped out this year and this is not part of that. This film entertains..as simple as that!<br/><br/>ps: Don't leave when the scene closes at the end...there is more after the credits!!! So many walked out thinking it was finished...Doh!!!<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy the film folks :)"
"taylorjustice27","Null","4","11","18 November 2011"," Amazing. This is coming from someone who is now a die-hard Twilight fan.
","Everything about this movie is amazing. That is all you need to know about this movie. I HIGHLY recommend it. I read the book and was expecting it to be a let compared to Twilight: Eclipse. Boy was I wrong. The effects were great, the make-up, the setting, everything was great. I was so sucked in to the movie that I did not even realize it was almost 2 hours long. It had a good way of keeping you interested and then left you wanting more at the end. Also, I have no idea what all this commotion about Kristen Stewart's acting is about anyways. I think she portrays the character of Bella just as I saw her when I was reading the books. Now I cannot wait for Twilight: Breaking Dawn part 2!"
"eleanorharrietfreeman","10","2","4","6 July 2016"," Amazing!
","This film is my favourite out of all the films. Somehow, I found it strangely gripping which kept me intrigued as to what happens next. Especially the birth scene, which is definitely the best scene in the whole film, which I will review below.<br/><br/>I was never really a Twilight fan until I accidentally came across the first film (Twilight) on TV. I decided to watch the film to see what the all the fuss was about, and even though there are some noticeable production mistakes, I loved the film, making me crave to watch the rest of the films in the series.<br/><br/>As said before, this was my favourite film out of the series as I found the birth scene strangely intriguing! The whole scene is terrifying (in a good way) and very dramatic! During the scene, the film suddenly increases in speed as everyone is rushing around, making the audience feel apart of the action. It is extremely realistic and in my opinion, and they filmed it in the best way possible! <br/><br/>*VERY SMALL SPOILER* At one point in the scene, Bella stops breathing causing Jacob to give her CPR *END OF SPOILER*, which is extremely gripping as it made me, as a viewer, not want to take my eyes off the screen in case I missed any part of the action occurring on screen.<br/><br/>Especially as the birth isn't a normal birth that people would experience, it is very creative and really makes it feel real to the audience. It is fairly violent and gory, but this adds to the creativity and effect that this has on the audience.<br/><br/>Referring back to the film as a whole, the audience experience a roller-coaster of emotions in the film; from weddings, to a new life being brought into the world, and a close on death experience. This film sure isn't short on hooking you, the audience, and will send you on a journey with some inspirational characters, travelling through their life and sharing their life experiences."

","Maybe the worst of the franchise. Without too many technically poorly done scenes, but at the same time, with too many scenes where nothings happens.<br/><br/>Of the little plot there actually is, its development is tv cable television quality level. Melodramatic and with superficial writing, only relevant and with tension for the ultra fans. The rest of us only see characters worried, annoyed, angry or sad, but without doing anything.<br/><br/>When there is tension, is absolutely forced by script conveniences, with sudden needs from characters out of nowhere, and wasting opportunities for real tension (that would've required attentive and smarter writing).<br/><br/>To end this, the CGI was atrocious, the worst in the saga, and the score was good for the first time in the franchise.

"specialfoxie","1","0","0","5 May 2020"," Awful, boring, nonsense
","I never normally write reviews, but this film was so terrible that I need it brought to justice.<br/><br/>I have wanted to watch the Twilight Saga for a while, but never been able to bring myself to do it in fear of the embarrassment that would come with discussing it amongst friends.<br/><br/>I'm obviously not the target demographic for these films and never went into this challenge expecting them to be good. However, this film might unironically be the worst movie I have ever seen. The pacing is horrendous, acting more like a filler episode of a T.V series. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is unrealistic, over the top and shallow given how the main relationship falls flat.<br/><br/>The movie also had some strange subtext that felt very pro-life / anti-abortion. I cannot prove this is what the writer intended, but they use telepathy to 'communicate' with the fetus and intentionally show how it has feelings and emotion. Very creepy, strange writing decision.<br/><br/>The only potentially good scene in the whole film is when the wolf pack are meeting and it is ruined by catastrophically implemented ADR which just makes the whole thing confusing to watch.<br/><br/>The character building in this franchise is poor, but this film takes the cake for inconsistencies. One character seems to have a completely different mindset from the previous film and decides to stick with Bella even though he wanted to kill her a few scenes before? They explain it away with a gimmic called imprinting, which is also another creepy aspect of this film.<br/><br/>I have just watched the film and I already cannot recall how they managed to fill two hours. What a waste of an evening."

","I didn't think it was funny in an unintentional way (which I usually do with Twilight Saga movies). It has its problems. The way Bella handles her pregnancy bothers me. The way Bella is so willing to marry Edward without meaningful consideration (which is horrid for someone at her age) bothers me. The dialogue is lacking in some parts too. The action is badly handled, at least when compared to the books. There is no tension or excitement really. However, I must say, all of the main actors's acting skills greatly improved. Visually well done."

"sherryfundin-14147","10","0","0","15 January 2020"," I am addicted to Twilight....
","This review is for the entire saga.<br/><br/>From first glance, I fell in love with Twilight.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's eyes are so expressive, it was like she was mesmerized, in a trance, and lost to Edward...forever. I am amazed at the quality of her acting though, at times, I thought the dialogue was laughable. In the beginning she does come across as a whiny, selfish brat, but because I know the ending, the whole triangle thing was explained in a mind blowing way. Her lip sucking and soft snorting could be annoying, but, like anything I fall in love with, I am easily able to get past it. For her age, she comes across as brave, intuitive, and able to handle whatever comes her way, never wavering.<br/><br/>The music is amazing and emotional.I laughed and I cried. I would get lost in it and it invoked so many emotions I would be overcome with...a warmth that is all encompassing, a sit up and pay attention moment when the danger rises to a fever pitch, or a clash between Edward and Jake is on the horizon. Like Calgon, I just wanted to close my eyes and let it take me away...deeper into the fantasy.<br/><br/>They did an amazing job with the special effects. The more I watch it, the more I marvel at them. We do have the cheesy moments and I do cringe, but they are few and brief.<br/><br/>Twilight has made everything vampire so much better for me. It allows me to visualize the action, such as fighting, death, turning...<br/><br/>Three outstanding peripheral characters stand out and I feel deserve a special mention. Blondie, for being there, Bella's savior til the end. Seth, what a sweet boy, that believes in doing the right thing, loyal and trustworthy. AND a very special shout out to Leah. When she makes that move in front of the Cullin's house...doesn't get much better than that.<br/><br/>To vamp or not to vamp, that is the question. I first got into vamps with Angel reruns, then Charmed and Supernatural reruns. I caught a few Buffy episodes, but missed out on most of it.<br/><br/>I do love my vamps mean and ugly, but, now, I also love them soft and vegetarian. Cheesy and hot. It's so bad I can't look away. I watch whatever pops up on cable over and over. binging on Hulu. Poor constipated Edward and lip sucking, soft snorting Bella. a whiny selfish brat...and a hottie, Jacob. Sometimes Edward's facial expressions are so very creepy. To pick my favorite character is really hard, because as I learn more about each one, they all have their special touch added to the whole.<br/><br/>Two other cringe worthy moments are when Riley is standing over Charlie...I can feel his breath on my face, and when Bella's knees hit the floor. I cringe every single time!<br/><br/>My favorite quote:<br/><br/>""So the lion fell in love with the lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a stupid lamb.""<br/><br/>""What a sick masochistic lion.""<br/><br/>Everything about Twilight has made my enjoyment of the supernatural world of werewolves and vampires so much more enjoyable. I am able to visualize the action and know more of the history of the fabulous fictional characters.<br/><br/>BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I rarely buy books or DVDs, but this was a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..and I bought the set of books too, so be on the lookout for those reviews."

","I think that everybody will agree with me here when i say that the Bella & Edward romance in Twilight is one of the worst, wooden & totally unconvincing romances ever filmed in the history of world cinema. But unfortunately not the writers or the director seems to understand this and thus what we have here is a film that probably uses up about 60% of its time with a ridiculous and often times unintentionally hilarious romance.<br/><br/>Eclipse was still pretty bad, but it was a step in the right direction for the franchise, as the focus seemed to be a bit more off of their worthless romance story and more on the actually interesting story about the newborns. Unfortunately, Breaking Dawn basically manages to fall into the same depths the first two fell in. We have a long drawn out half hour long wedding scene as if they thought they could pull off a 'The Godfather' or a 'The Deer Hunter' scene ( I apologise for naming these two actually GOOD movies in the same sentence as Twilight ). At the start you can see Kristen Stewart actively trying to pull off a happy face and you can frequently see her smiling ( Don't worry, her sighing, head shaking and eye contact evasing is still there ) which was already an extreme surprise to me, even though it was mostly just her lips moving and not much else. However, this was only limited to the start since after that her infamous legendary wooden facial expressions return. Ofcourse it doesn't help during the wedding scene that none of the characters there, or in the whole universe of Twilight for that matter are even slightly interesting.<br/><br/>The honeymoon sequence consists of wholly Bella & Edward romance scenes and these 20-30 minutes have to be some of the worst ever filmed. We know their romance is terrible, unconvincing and ridiculous due to the fact that both of them are unable to act and unable to express sincere human emotions ( Especially Bella obviously ). Bella can be heard saying, and i quote: 'Why can't you see how perfectly happy i am???' Gee, Bella, i wonder why, could it be because you are just totally unable of conveying emotions in every way when you come onto the screen? The cinematography in these scenes was alright though, i'll give it that, but if you cannot combine cinematography with a story or great characters you might as well be watching an environmental documentary instead of a film.<br/><br/>The final hour of the film might have been interesting, if we as the audience were actually given a single reason to care about what happens to any of the characters in this film. And why oh why would Jacob and Edward seriously fight over a wooden plank who is unable to comfortly gesture even the simplest human emotions. We are never given a single reason as to why the men in this film are attracted to Bella, other than dumb statements such as Edward saying during the wedding that she is 'someone you can bare your soul to, and who accepts you as you are', yeah right. Name me one person who couldn't come up with this blatantly obvious cliché nonsensical reason and color me surprised. <br/><br/>I should also mention that there is a scene in which a bunch of CGI wolves start talking amongst themselves, since that scene is so ridiculous it deserves a little rant of its own. At first i thought the Quilletes could only talk in human form, but it seems as though i was wrong, and what a mistake this turned out to be. Their mouths don't move, so where is the sound even coming from? It is even supposed to be an important scene about standing up for yourself, but it is disguised in so much ridiculous CGI that it is actually just comic gold. I have no qualms with certain things being CGI ( Even though the CGI wolves were terrible ), but such a ridiculous attempt of conveying emotion in a scene cannot be told in such a complete CGI fest where not even one actual human being is visible.<br/><br/>It seems as though the writers and the director didn't learn from their mistakes, and kept the focus on Bella & Edward's terrible romance for far too long. The second half of the film might be slightly more interesting, but it is still as terrible cinema can get. It does have some certain good musical scores and cinematography, but in context of this film this cannot possibly even slightly save the failure it has become."

","I knew I had to see this movie sometime especially after the lengthy review that Doug Walker gave it and how much he hated it. This is a guy who loved the other movies because of how bad they were. I specifically downloaded the Rifftrax file for this movie as a free sample and I was devastated to find out that the website has apparently changed and all my history was deleted so I had to buy the file for this movie. It was money well spent because I would have gone nuts if not for the file. This movie is amazingly boring and stupid in nearly every sense of the word.<br/><br/>I actually looked up critical reviews and I think even people who were fans of the other movies hated this one. I guess I will give those other movies credit for being better. This movie features Edward and Bella getting married. Bella gets pregnant and most of this movie is just them talking about whether she should have an abortion. Okay they don't use the word ""abortion"" but it's what they're talking about. This is just a nasty unpleasant movie for me because everyone in this film is just so mean. Everybody is telling Bella to get rid of her fetus because it's killing her. This is just an uncomfortable movie with how they show Bella slowly get sicker because this vampire fetus is sucking the life out of her.<br/><br/>Everybody just wants this fetus dead. I mean they really do use words like ""that thing"", ""bloodsucker"" and ""demon"" when describing a fetus. I don't see how anyone can defend such a mean spirited message. They call the fetus ""it"" over and over. This film is just depressing with how bitter everyone is. It just gets worse as time goes on. I am so glad this is the last ""Twilight"" movie I'll ever watch in my life. Apparently, there has somehow never been a vampire that's gotten a human pregnant before. During sex, Edward is literally destroying the beds and giving Bella bruises, which she's mostly okay with.<br/><br/>The Rifftrax had tons of great stuff and I especially like, ""Oh honey, everyone's gone! Our unholy marriage must have triggered the rapture!"". I also loved when they referred to Jacob and said, ""Hi, runner up!"". I got a chuckle out of, ""I drink your bloodshake!"" too. Okay, did they really have to make a joke about bronies? I mean, I'm glad they acknowledge them, but don't say anything bad about us. I think this is the first time I've heard them riff through the credits, although they do stop at some point. Anywho, this is a trashy movie no one should watch. *"

","Omg - that movie absolutely does the book justice. I was disappointed in Eclipse as it glossed over my favorite chapter from the book on the bed scene, portraying it as a trivial event and not the heart stopping scene I had pictured in my head. Breaking Dawn by comparison had brilliant effects, especially with Bellas pregnancy scenes, it had beautiful love scenes and the wedding scene was spectacular. The ending left me begging for more. I can not wait 12 months. I went to see Breaking Dawn with my girlfriend who had only seen the movie about 12 hours before at the midnight session. She was ready for a third sitting.... I too expect to see it at the movies again."
"jadeybabey07","10","6","20","18 November 2011"," A must see!
","I thought the movie was excellent! I'm not just saying that because i'm a girl and i'm crazy over the saga, i really did enjoy the movie from start to finish. I think if you haven't read the books and you go to watch the movies then you are really missing out. You need to understand the love and connections between each character to really enjoy the film, i thought the acting was much better and the overall atmosphere of the film improved greatly.<br/><br/>One thing i would say to the males (since that's who the majority of the votes give 1/10) is that Twilight is like a teenage girls fantasy, just like you have superhero's like batman and iron man. Girls generally have a fantasy of romance rather than action and i think twilight is one of the few films out there for teenage girls which really delivers that. <br/><br/>Also I've got to disagree with those who say that the movie was stretched out far more than necessary. Twilight fans WANT every scene from the book in the movie and although everything wasn't in, i think the film catered to its fans superbly. If they rushed through the scenes then that would be catering to the people who don't really like twilight not the fans.<br/><br/>I would say the movie definitely did the first half of the book justice and most of the important scenes that twihards love are in there (although i did want to see the rivalry between Jacob and Rosalie). Overall an excellent film and i highly recommend everyone that likes twilight to go and see it, and everyone who doesn't or are in two minds about twilight, go read the books then watch it and you'll understand how great it really is!"

","perfect perfect perfect that's all i can say , this is really Unexpected loved this movie 10000x more than the others twilight films combined , Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson deserves an Oscar for their amazing performance , their performances were outstanding and Bill Condon saved twilight's *** you know the others ones wasn't half great as Breaking Dawn my rating for Breaking Dawn is 10/10 for the Twi-hards , 8/10 for NON fans , 4.5/10 for the twilight haters , 0/10 for the potter-fans because they will never love twilight . Bill Condon makes Breaking Dawn part 1 almost better than the book , even thought some critics say its sucks but i read some of them actually they have NO idea about the whole story except the pregnancy , they are paid to hate on twilight they just read the Wiki of Breaking Dawn and then they criticized the movie without mention anything about the great acting and the amazing directing so the critics are lame don't take them too seriously"
"PiperGrissom1","10","5","16","19 November 2011"," Still beaming over ""Breaking Dawn Part 1""
","Loving the entire saga like I do, I tend to like all the films no matter what. I loved the first three, but honestly, New Moon wasn't that great. I still watch it often and enjoy it, but as always, some films are better than others.<br/><br/>*****Spoilers Ahead***** I have read ""Breaking Dawn"" many times. It is my favorite book in the saga. I'm not a young adult, so when they finally make love on their honeymoon, I was overjoyed, yet frustrated due to the lack of a 'sex scene' in the book. The film does not disappoint. We get a gorgeous wedding, a hot wedding night, including a headboard getting busted (I screamed ""YES""), and feathers. After all the romance, we get an unplanned, pregnancy that no one ever thought was possible. That is when the drama really kicks in.<br/><br/>Now, knowing that this is a big book where tons of things happen, there are scenes, conversations and events that have to be left out. I did miss Rosalie etching ""Fido"" on a silver dish that she fashioned into a doggy bowl for Jacob, I missed the eggs that Bella was eating my the dozen on the honeymoon, I missed the Alice saying ""She's going to be dazzling."" All in all, I'm a very happy Twi-hard.<br/><br/>This is the best film of the saga and if you have read the books, you will love it too.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to Part 2!"

Taylor Lautner was pretty good in the beginning but he failed almost in the whole movie , Kristen did an amazing job in this movie she was so emotional and very very good even the haters should admit it . especially at the birth although this movie got some critics from some clueless reviewers like the potter-fans that have no idea about the movie . this is why i hated Harry Potter because the critics are so fair with Harry potter but when its came to twilight this gave the movies 0/10 like always , this proves that they got paid to hate on every twilight movie actually i read the reviews in RT and then i went to see the movie with a bad idea about it because of them but this time they failed i really enjoyed the movie and i give it A+ and i'm a guy , this is the best twilight despite the critics .. congratulation for Bill and the twilight fans and the cast"

But Breaking Dawn P1 has really turned out tons better than those two. It is a MUST see for all fans and I cannot wait to see P2!<br/><br/>It contained not just the juicy love stuff that we fans like to see but it had some great hostility and tension in it which was natural and expected. It followed the book as best as possible. I just wish that it had left scenes in it to actually follow the book more. Unfortunately there are too many teenie boppers out there so they felt that they had to keep it as clean as possible which SUCKED. That was probably the worst thing about the movie.<br/><br/>I loved how it ended..it ended just where I thought it would and it all came together, flowed nicely and it was down right awesome!"
"kez0","9","4","12","19 November 2011"," Great Movie for Twilight Fans
","I went to see Breaking Dawn Part 1 today, and I was not disappointed. I'm a Twihard, and I'm the kind of person who will grab one of the books in the Twilight Saga, open to a random page, and start reading. Breaking Dawn was the first movie in the series that seemed like a ""real"" movie- not just an illustration of the books (although I really liked Eclipse). I think all the actors gradually improved through out the movies, and they all had their best performances in Breaking Dawn (major improvement in Kristen Stewart's acting, Rob Pattinson and Taylor Lautner showed more emotion in this film ).I even found the CGI wolves to look very real.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn the movie followed the story line of the book fairly well, some details from the books were included and some quotes were taken directly from the book. However, a few fight scenes between werewolves and vampires that were not in the book were added, most likely to make the movie appeal to a larger audience. Members of the Cullen family, like Esme and Alice, are given more parts in this movie. The beginning of the movie is very happy , but the movie drastically changes to a drama/part horror towards the middle and end. The last half hour/45 minutes is very intense. I had to turn away from the screen a couple of times. <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 15/16 see this movie. Also, don't leave at the credits. I found out after I left the theater that there is a scene that helps lead up to Breaking Dawn Part 2 shown following the credits. <br/><br/>If you like the Twilight Saga, you will like this movie. If you haven't read the books, you will most likely be confused with what is happening."

","I knew what to expect from this movie before i watched it because i read the whole book series. i thought it would really suck from beginning to end but I gotta say, i was surprised i enjoyed the first part of the wedding. I felt like crying cause it was just really beautiful :) it was funny and interesting in the beginning, but towards the end, i felt like it was lacking. I wish there was more action to it or more characters if i were to redo the whole twilight series. As always, Kristen Stewart's acting isn't very good but i loved the part where she gave birth. It was really convincing for me. All in all the movie was ""just okay."" It's nothing to be excited about."

","Better than expected. The acting has improved and so has the intensity and the storyline. Was much expecting more action but it was fine. It was also great to see wolf telepathy and more dialogue and screening time from the wolf-pack and other cullens. the directing and pacing was alright, but it got a little bit boring and slow during the first half of the movie. There could've been much more execution from Jacob but all in all, it was a good try. Condon did a great work, much better than previous directions. I didn't expect much - but the movie did exceed my expectations - so 7/10. Will be expecting the 2nd installment. This is coming from a 13 year old."

Breaking Dawn is like a Romance Novel. Edward and Bella get married and go on their honeymoon. Then a problem arises! The movie has it all. Conflict, babies, two guys interested in one girl etc. The movie picked up in the second half when the conflict began. The usual Edward/Jacob feud continues. Well, acted, and directed movie. There was no inconsistencies or bad acting with Breaking Dawn. I would give the movie a 6 out of 10, but my wife would give it a 10. She is upset that she has to wait a full year for part 2 especially since it is already filmed. The movie company and actors are just trying to make more bucks off of the series just like Harry Potter."

From the director's who direct to the acting. PHENOMENAL! I luv how in this one, you get so much details in it that were in the book. the dream sequences and the flashbacks are wonderful and visually appealing. The birth scene was epic! From the make-up that Kristen Stewart was wearing,(and by the way the make up they did for her was on point), to the acting. The scene was shown through Bella's point of view which means we saw glimpses and heard the screams. Well done! only thing I might not have liked that much is the music. the music to me didn't really do it, but the score was excellent! I though ""A Thousand Years"" should have been the song they walked down the aisle with. But, all as well.

"preppy-3","1","3","8","26 November 2011"," WAY too slow
","The continuing ""Twilight"" saga. Bella (Kristen Stewart) marries vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) against the objections of werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lauter). They go on a honeymoon and Bella gets pregnant. However this seems to be a vampire baby and is growing quickly and killing her....and it seems no one can help her. Jacob vows vengeance against Edward.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is that it moves too damn SLOW! I read the book (which is terrible) so I know how this ends...and there is NO reason to drag this out to two movies. It could have easily been done in 2 and a half or three hours. This is just a studio squeezing the audience for as much money as it can. There are at least EIGHT music montages which add nothing to the movie. One has Stewart staring blankly at the camera (which is her only expression anyways) the whole time! To make it worse the dialogue is terrible and boring. Also Lautner and Stewart seem to be in a competition over who can be a worse actor. Lautner wins by a very small margin. Those two are TERRIBLE! Their faces never change expression at all! On the plus side it is well-directed and the wedding sequence is great. All the actors and actresses who play the Cullens or the werewolves are good and Booboo Stewart is especially good as Seth. The special effects are OK but the talking wolves looked pretty silly and the big fight between vampires and werewolves is shot in darkness and with TONS of quick cutting so you can barely see what is happening! All in all this is a pretty bad movie-way too slow and filled with bad acting and dialogue. Even Twilight fans hate this one. A 1."
"lizwilder_1234","6","3","8","23 November 2011"," An OK film.
","I was looking forward to this movie after i was incredibly disappointed with New Moon and Eclipse, but this one didn't really live up to my expectations. Yes, they followed the book, but it dragged and dragged and I seriously felt like sleeping. The book is much better, and what made this film quite bad compared to the others was that the acting has suddenly got SO MUCH worse. It's like they can't be bothered anymore. I wouldn't bother seeing it if you have high expectations of it, but if you read the books and watch the films and you're not crazy and obsessive, then you may want to watch it (if you don't mind bad acting too). The best actors were probably the minor ones - Billy Burke, Kellan Lutz and Nikki Reed. That's just my opinion. A lot of it is just kissing, hugging, sex, talking, more talking and a lot more boring bits that you feel as though you have to sit through out of the desire to see Bella have a half vamp baby and the bit we've all been waiting for and knew would happen from the start. The special effects are OK, but this film was a bit bland for all it's hyped up to be. I do love the books, but if you hate the films, this one will make you want to scream."

","Cast: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Nikki Reed, Billy Burke, Sarah Clarke, Kellan Lutz, Anna Kendrick.<br/><br/>Parents' guide: Implied sex, violence, bloody birth.<br/><br/>MONTREAL - After what seemed like an eternity spent in adolescent limbo, the Twilight series grows up, sort of, in Breaking Dawn Part 1.<br/><br/>The fourth film in the series – the first in the two-part final chapter, the second of which will be released a year from now – ties up a lot of loose ends that had been lingering over the three earlier instalments. And it offers some major plot developments while leaving room for more.<br/><br/>Not a lot happens in the film, but what does is major. It can be summed up in three words: marriage, sex, pregnancy. You know, typical vampire movie fare.<br/><br/>Yes, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally tie the knot. And in true Twilight fashion, their union is treated with plenty of romantic clichés and drawn-out melodrama.<br/><br/>It begins with an invitation. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) receives his and is not amused. The buildup to the big day is shown with ample attention to detail – breaking in heels, hair and makeup, heirlooms passed down, all to a sweeping classical soundtrack.<br/><br/>But not everything is perfect. Previously certain of her feelings, Bella begins to have doubts – and bad dreams – about tying the knot with the undead. Needless to say, she forges ahead.<br/><br/>The wedding is treated with swoon-inducing sensitivity. As Bella prepares to be escorted down the aisle by her father, Charlie (Billy Burke), the camera pauses on her nervous face, her hair clip, her neck, her veil and the intricate design of her dress plunging down her back. Don't get me started on the kiss.<br/><br/>There are amusing speeches (mercifully edited into a snappy montage), dancing and just enough dramatic tension (cue Jacob) to let us know that this is not going to be all fun and games. But there is a little fun and games.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the honeymoon. Edward goes all out, sweeping his bride off to Rio, Brazil, then a quiet island where they can be alone.<br/><br/>All is picture-perfect, right down to the nuptial bed that awaits them, beckoning. After three films of foreplay, Bella and Edward are ready to consummate their love. The results, while far from raunchy, are surprisingly suggestive; let's just say the Earth shakes.<br/><br/>The blissful tone takes a turn in the second half, as director Bill Condon gets a chance to show his dark side. Pregnant with what, no one's sure, exactly, Bella turns a ghastly shade of pale. The rest of the film is devoted to keeping her alive as the beast within grows, and gets thirsty.<br/><br/>A dutiful action sequence breaks the adult vibe with some cartoonishly animated battles with wolves. But when all is said and done, Twilight makes a necessary quantum leap forward, while managing to end on a suspenseful note that neatly sets us up for one more round. Speaking of which, fans are advised to stay in their seats for a mid-credit teaser of what's in store for next time.<br/><br/>tdunlevy@montrealgazette.com"

","I found an interesting take on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 here:<br/><br/>http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/<br/><br/>Once upon a time, Hollywood made movies intended to be seen in one sitting usually lasting 90 minutes or so.<br/><br/>You told a story with a beginning, a middle and an end—voilà, there's your movie.<br/><br/>But toward the end of the 20th century when executives decided to establish the sequel as the preferred business model in the American film industry—and theoretically ensure a stream of income lasting years if not decades—brevity no longer equaled bankroll and all bets were off.<br/><br/>So it comes as no surprise that the fourth release from the Twilight machine, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1, should once again prove to be a huge maybe even record-breaking commercial success.<br/><br/>By some estimates, the Twilight film franchise has already earned nearly $2 billion to date—equal to the entire GDP of some foreign countries.<br/><br/>But just why do films like The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 reap huge box office receipts over and over again?"

","I wasn't a fan of the first 2 films, as I thought the acting was poor in them, however I also thought the books weren't great. Book 3 and film 3 stepped it up a gear, but book 4 has steadily become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't go to the cinema with high expectations, due to the previous films and expected to be disappointed that a lot of the content of the books might be missed. I was so so so happy after watching this film. <br/><br/>The director has stayed true to the book and kept the sweet, beautiful relationship Bella has with Edward, allowing Kristen Stewart to act for once! The soundtrack that accompanies the film is just so beautiful and at times, particularly when walked down the aisle, I felt very emotional! I thought the scenes where they have sex, are tamed down and suitable for the age certificate. My main problem with the Twilight Saga films is that I feel there would be so much more action/passion if the age certificate was higher, however I do see they want to maximize the audience number. <br/><br/>I came out of this film desperate to watch it again. Having such a love for the book I felt like it had done it justice and cannot wait to see part 2, where all the 'action' is. People who are slating this film, calling it cheesy, and that nothing much happens....haven't read the book! The 'cheesy' lines are in the book and in the characters like Stephanie Meyer wants, and in all fairness I didn't deem anything to be cheesy!! My bf came out saying 'nothing happened', which it didn't if your wanting action, but if you want to continue on the story of Bella and Edwards love for each other and watch it grow and develop I'm sure you will love this film. Roll on Part 2!!!<br/><br/>p.s. stay and watch the scene after the credits...its the volturi :)"

Also visually beautiful found it to be the best installment of the Twilight Saga. This is a love story not an action film.

","Due to the complexities of the book this film contained not only action sequences with the usual dose of teenage angst, but also contained a fair amount of humour. It was believable, enjoyable and a true interpretation of the first half of the book. The only criticism I would make is that there was not enough explanation in some parts for those who had not read the book, particularly with regard to imprinting. My husband, who has seen the other films but not read the books, had to ask me to clarify the plot on this point. The cinematography was good and in general it was all very enjoyable although the scene with the wolves talking at once did not work for me. I can see what the director was going for, but it did not come off well with the result that the scene was a bit confusing. It ended at a good point and did not leave me feeling frustrated that it had come to a premature finish. Perhaps my favourite of all of the Twilight films so far and enjoyed by the family and friends, who had mostly not read the book, that joined me. Recommended."

I thought the dialoge was really entertaining. Everyone in the theater was laughing and even clapped at the end. If you love the books you should watch it.

","I have followed this saga for years now and i have read the book multiple time thoroughly. So i know what I'm talking about when i say that this movie lived up to the book. The movie although didn't contain many quotes loved by all of us. The idea that Edward was the one that hurt Bella and he was taking her to explore the island to tire her out so she wouldn't want to be intimate was not explained properly like in the book.<br/><br/>When it came to the werewolf transformations is was mesmerizing the way the wolf just changed mid- air and landed as a wolf amazed the whole cinema. It was very believable and thats what made the movie real for me. But it was a bit over the top the fact that Jacob had his shirt off 4 seconds into the movie!!!! The birth was a bit gruesome for a M/PG-13 movie that anyone can go and see. I think that maybe it should have been an M15+ at least. The vampire transformation of Bella was amazing it was very clever the way that the movie portrayed her blood freezing and her hair repairing itself which made it believable and creepy in itself.<br/><br/>It was truly and amazing movie over all there are not many floors it is is a great movie to watch with a group of friends I personally really enjoyed it but you can judge for yourself."
"faithhopeamour","10","4","13","20 November 2011"," What you REALLY WANT TO KNOW about Breaking Dawn part 1
","****Before you read my review, note that I WILL TELL a lot (DISCRIPTIVE)about this movie. Know that with all critic reviews and 'word of mouth' reviews, you'll need to see the movie YOURSELF to make your own opinion.<br/><br/>That said, the first thing I want to mention is that the director really did a phenomenal job at sticking to the book. There are some things (from the book) that are left out, but you won't miss it.<br/><br/>There are 5 parts of this movie: The Wedding The Honeymoon Jacob The Pregnancy/Birth Bella's Transformation<br/><br/>The Wedding: The first 25 minutes are solely based on this theme. Its a gorgeous wedding (as seen in the trailer. Bella's dress is breathtaking, etc...) The greatest part of the wedding is when individual family members/friends take the Mic to give their personal 'toasts' to the bride and groom. LOVED IT! And, of course right before the wedding ends, Jake shows up for his dance. He leaves angry as he now knows the honeymoon will be TRADITIONAL, IE: Love-making!<br/><br/>The Honeymoon: What can I say about this that you don't already know? The Isle of Esme is gorgeous. Bella daunts a white bikini that looks fabulous on her! There's games of chess played almost daily, exploring in the jungles, cliff diving, etc, etc... Oh and yes... They make love. (To call it sex is unjustified) This scene was moving. It demonstrated Edward & Bella's unfailing love for one another and Kirsten Stewart (as Bella) did an exceptional job at conveying (the morning after) her experience of this intimate act for the first time by simply looking at herself in the mirror, saying no words at all, but those of us that have 'been there, done that' can definitely relate. In any event the honeymoon is cut short due to the sudden sickness and movement in Bella's tummy! <br/><br/>Jacob: There is much more in the book regarding Jake than in the movie, but there is enough in the movie that Twi-hard fans will be placated. Bottom line, Jacob gets news Bella is 'sick' and goes to the Cullen's to demand answers (or to see if she is still human) and his question is answered as she stands up with her swollen and bruised belly. Of course we deal with the anguish that Jake endures, although I wasn't as moved through his demonstration of this as much as was with some of the other actors. (IE: Billy Burke (Charlie) his acting is enough to make you want to cry!) There is one scene in particular that gave me chills though, and that is when Jake's alpha kicks in and he leaves the pack. LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT! I'm not going to tell you how the director made that happen, but trust me.... IT WAS LIBERATING! Again.... LOVED IT! Anyway, Jake now is on the Cullen's side and la-de-dah.<br/><br/>The Pregnancy/Birth: I'm shaking my head at all the things I read about this. Supposedly there's been talk of weak stomachs resulting in vomit...Give me a break! Are you serious?! Look, Bella obviously has a baby growing inside her that is not compatible with her tiny body. She begins to look emaciated, pale, ghostly and all her loved ones are stressing as she and bodyguard Rosealie are determined to have this baby regardless of the circumstances! There is one scene that is quite moving... when Edward hears the baby and its at that point that he, Bella and the baby are in unison and a bit of hope and happily ever after just starts to tug at you when SUDDENLY AND AT A FAST PACE Bella's little baby is ready to come out! Look, I'm going to keep it as real as I can: This scene is great, NOT GROSS! If anything, you feel for Bella because you can't begin to imagine the pain she must be in. Afterall, she's just had a C-Section performed via vampire fangs and no epidural! In all honesty, I wanted to see more! But this is a PG-13 movie so there are limits. In any event, we do get to hear bella's last words, which is after seeing Reneesmee: ""Beaufiful""......... flatline_________________<br/><br/>Bella's Transformation: ________________ Now Bella being flatlined and cold, Edward injects his venom into Bella's heart, all the while the wolves are en route to kill the infant that Jake has imprinted on! Edward is doing all that he can by biting into major arteries and getting his venom into Bella.... It was pretty awesome how that was portrayed. We got to see the venom move through Bella's veins and surround/saturate her heart. IT WAS COOL! Sadly, Edward has to stop because his home is about to be invaded by wolves! There's a bit of a combat, but it all stops when Edward announces that Jake has imprinted on the precious Reneesmee (and SHE IS GORGEOUS!)and that it is the #1 rule to NEVER destroy an IMPRINTED BEING! :-) Yay! Finally Jake is set free! OMGosh.... Back to Bella.... Let me just say this: She was meant to be a Vampire! IMO, probably one of the most beautiful vampires I've EVER SEEN! <---- on TV that is! <br/><br/>I gave this movie 10 out of 10. See for yourself. My review is MY opinion. What's yours?"
"catherineearnshaw12","Null","4","13","18 November 2011"," Best movie of the season!
","My fiancé and I absolutely loved this movie! The actors, director and crew did an amazing job! I especially enjoyed the way the camera seemed to capture the palpable, raw emotion in each epic scene. We loved the way the film adhered to the book perfectly and the wonderful portrayal of the wedding, honeymoon, and pregnancy scenes. The one part of the film that really got to me was, of course, the wedding scene. Kristen Stewart as Bella made for a breathtakingly beautiful bride! As you hear the sweet and endearing vows proclaimed by Edward and Bella you start to almost feel the truly heart-stopping feeling of true love. We also adored the wolf scenes which were strikingly realistic and the use of the ""wolf-telepathy"" in the film. Overall, this film was an exhilarating instant-classic that keeps you on the edge of your seat and yearning for more!! Can't wait for part two!"

","Okay, so after quite a while between the movies I once again tentatively stepped into the world of Twilight, an unnervingly fake world, haunted by the soulless eyes of the damned... Nah, they're really not all that bad! I mean they're definitely far from good, but not absolutely awful and in my opinion not quite the apocalyptic motion picture triumphs of arrogance and self-absorption they're made out to be. I think a lot of people hate these so much because much like(totally unwarranted!) Howard the Duck, they're popular to hate. They're indeed freaking beyond pretentious and shallow, but they're also harmless and stupid, and a lot of fun to rag on. I rather enjoy their lousiness, they are very amusing! Like let's talk about the main heroine for a second, a major character whom I have not grown to like or give a crap about in four movies and counting.. There's nothing wrong with Bella, but what's right with her!? She's just constantly creating conflict with her mere presence and keeps playing the two guys off against each other, and why does she have to look so sad and disturbed all the time, even after she's just gotten married to the one she's supposed to love and they're driving away? She's so ridiculous, I do get that the character's meant to be awkward and a little strange, like perhaps she already has a little something supernatural in her somewhere, and I've heard one idiotic theory that she's supposed to be a sort of blank so that girls can imagine themselves in her shoes or something and that's cool, but I've seen other performances from actors who were playing it distant, cold and/or aloof who still managed to instill a little of their own personality into the role that made you care for them in some small way, or at least understand why they are how they are or do what they do, but I guess Kristen Stewart was too cool to bother with anything like that.. Gah, the bitch was wrong for the part! A damn piece of lumber would have made a better lead! I think it's her that really hurts this franchise the most. And Taylor Lautner is such an unremitting tool of a pathetic actor..and ugly, got a weird full-scale dwarf thing going on there.. He no good, no good at all! only thing that gets him by is that six-pack! I hope his career died with these films. And then there was that Edward, he was the same as always, so devoted, so bloated with misery and pathos, always holding himself with such ceaseless funereal leadenness. I like Ed, I think it's a good performance and he created a pretty interesting character. I really enjoyed the early flashback sequence that reveals some of his past, I always find that kind of stuff to be fairly cool in these films. And I liked when the wolves who I guess were the antagonists this time around, pull an Otis and Milo and talk to each other psychically, regarding what's to be done about a certain impending birth, quite a rousing scene. They never do quite get the CGI to look right on those things.. I also loved when they made Bella look all miserable and skinny like a crack addict, the visual effects of her deterioration were astonishing. I appreciated how they handled Bella becoming a vampire, I found it less disturbing there being no other choice to save her life, rather than it being him biting her neck in yet another romantic scene with the annoying music playing which wouldn't have felt right to me, as she was now 'technically' no longer alive and was a bloodless she-thing of the night. But hey, how was she all that different or worse-off than she was before? I enjoyed this one about the same as all the others, I have actually grown to somewhat like this universe and care a little about how it's all gonna turn out, but they never really change or evolve at all, it's just the same thing over and over, it always boils down to vampires against werewolves and the boring girl in the middle, whoever wins I'm vacuously thrilled and entertained. The biggest problem of this one for me was that although it had a plot, there was no story, and what little there was felt noticeably stretched-out to a crazy degree! They get married and have their honeymoon for a good forty+ minutes, she somehow gets pregnant and the magic accelerated birth causes her to slowly die, there's a lot of werewolf politics as the fuzzy-wuzzies for some reason fear the unnatural child and want to kill it even if they have to kill Bella in the process, there's oodles of the usual mundane talking with the three semi-developed characters, the lycanthropes and bloodsuckers have a little skirmish, the baby is born, but to save her life Edward has to transform Bella into a vampire, she awakens, pointless but awesome cameo of the evil vampire elders - that's it! That was quite the cliffhanger of an image to go out on, and a very nice change to the typical flowery scene of nauseating beautified bliss. So all in all, although to me like the rest it fails deliver satisfactorily in the end, the process getting there is a genuinely entertaining one. Bring on the Dawn...I look forward to it."
"DICK STEEL","Null","3","9","22 November 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Breaking Dawn Part 1
","One cannot deny that Twilight smells of serious money, and following the Harry Potter film franchise had its final book split into two for that extra injection into the coffers. But I had to admit that Breaking Dawn Part 1 isn't as dreadful as the other two films that followed the first film, since they were essentially rehashing a lot of the same themes with Bella (Kristen Stewart) still being indecisive about whether she prefers the vampire or thw wolf, and finally made up her mind here in marrying one of them right from the start.<br/><br/>And oh the fuss about what Bella is wearing for her wedding, and how a vampire can consummate a wedding is all but answered in this installment, I think. Inviting friends and family and plenty of other support characters appearing over the course of the three films so far whom you probably care less about, a union between a man and a woman spelt a heartbreak for werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who disappeared for the most part, but not before tearing off his shirt to offer Team Jacob fans a glimpse of his rock hard abs before a half a movie absence. So Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella journey to Brazil and to its offshore island to make love, and Stephanie Meyer's imagination with award winning director Bill Condon's vision explains how powerful a vampire's orgasm can be.<br/><br/>In which case Edward decides to stay celibate thereafter knowing his pleasure equates to Bella's physical pain, until they found out that they had never thought to use contraceptives. After all, an undead producing seeds for offspring? One has to get past that plot point, with nary an explanation, in order for Breaking Dawn to work. As a teen movie, at least it got it right to have its main characters abstain from sex until marriage, but seriously family planning was never part of any serious discussion between Edward and Bella, adopting very common attitudes such as ""it'll never happen to us"". Well, guess what?<br/><br/>Reality quickly sinks in post-honeymoon stage especially when the couple faces a huge problem, in this case the disbelief that Bella can get pregnant (Wolf boy is still a virgin, so no hanky panky here...) and the decision whether or not to keep the baby since it's growing at an accelerated pace, and could be a half human half vampire monster, eating his mom from the inside out. Research shows the baby will be born through the breaking of all critical bones in the human body, so therein lies the existential dilemma - keep the baby and the mom dies, or kill the baby so that mom lives. Plenty of excellent soul searching stuff here by humans, vampires and wolves with the latter determined not to let something unknown threaten their very survival and existence.<br/><br/>Compared to the other earlier films, I grudgingly admit this one boasted better makeup, especially in making Kristen Stewart look really ghastly and unappealing, and kudos to the actress to have had that bit of makeup and prosthetics assist her in dealing with the emotions and mood swings that come with pregnancy. This book was a little bit more mature in its dealing with heavier themes, and Condon found the right balance in introducing those themes without being overbearing or preachy about. For that, credit has to go where credit is deserved, and as an emotional journey, well this one was quite the relief given what audiences had to endure from the earlier films, but that still doesn't make this a romantic masterpiece, lacking in genuine emotion and feeling.<br/><br/>For the fans of Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner split into two different camps, well unfortunately your pretty boys didn't fare as well as the lass this time, turning from friends to foes to friends and back again so very often, you'd start to wonder just exactly who was being wishy-washy. Robert Pattinson seemed to have the least to do here, and became rather pedestrian, while Taylor Lautner's pedigree wolf bloodline sees him relegated to being just a guard dog outside of the Cullins family home in the forest and being told to get out when he snuck into the house without invitation, and who is to know he had actually held the key to short-changing the audience from one big finale battle between the wolf clan and the Cullens.<br/><br/>For completeness sake I will be watching the next concluding episode of the film so as to achieve closure. The dialogue in this one's pretty horrendous, the acting rather bland and has a soundtrack full of pop music and ballads that nobody's actively listening to. The most gruesome scene involves a makeshift operating table and the much talked about child birth, but trust me it was quite aesthetically and tastefully (pardon the pun) done without over- reliance on shock tactics. Adopting the expected, logical cliffhanger knowing what's next in store for Bella, the concluding film won't open until a year from now, and it's a tall order, but I'm really hoping for a fruitful conclusion."
"nflores342","Null","3","9","22 November 2011"," Just Okay, Nothing more
","The reason these reviews are read is to gather information on whether or not the reader should spend their money on this movie, with that in mind i'm reviewing the movie as a movie, not just as a movie based on a book.<br/><br/>So with that lets begin, The acting is as you expect it to be, just plain and nothing special, although some very small credit should be given to K-stew, she did slightly better. The hype for this movie was on a level with Harry Potter, only HP conquered all in literary and cinematic form.<br/><br/>The Locations of the movie were worth the plain storyline, they were a character of themselves, but what made the movie truly worth it was the prosthetics that Kristen donned to play a Pregnant deformed human, bravo special effects you hit it spot on.<br/><br/>Costumes, same as prior films, Music, consistent and wonderfully put together, the only problematic portion of the film is when the CGI wolves are having mental monologues, no one in the theater could keep a straight face. On top of that the storyline was inconsistent in pacing, it took a bit for the movie to get interesting.<br/><br/>With that Breaking Dawn as a film, lets be honest, its not great, the series as films, well its no bueno too, but as stated as books where our imagination has no budget the films are somewhat decent, and with that I give this film a 7/10 not for the books transformation to film but because the movie entertained me for the two hours that I watched it, and that is what films are supposed to do."
"gareth-91","Null","3","9","21 November 2011"," really enjoyed this
","I wish this film had been longer to include more of the sense of time passing, as in the book the pregnancy takes a long time - there is also the relationship with Seth & Leah. There weren't any wolf fights in the book, but I guess films feel the need to do visual stuff. A friend disliked the leg shaving scene, but I liked that was left in as Bella was feeling nervous & it was in the book. I liked the time on the island, that gave a sense of how long the honeymoon was. The whole film was under 2 hours, so it's a shame they didn't add a bit more time and settle down more into the being in the house part. I love these books, and it's not for the action - I would be quite happy to not have any action, just see how the people relate to each other. When the wolves turned back to people again they really should have been naked (that would have been quite nice, & more authentic) - but they managed to have loads of clothes on. Oh well, you don't get everything. It would have been nice to see more of the Jacob/Rose hate thing, which was quite funny too. I'm looking forward to part 2 with the beautiful Renesmee - interesting when she's very little. I would really like to see more of the relationships in the house. The book was perfect, so it's a shame to change things about for the film, but I guess they just don't have time to cram so much information in. I'm going to see it again, as I'm sure there are loads of details I missed. I was a bit worried about Kirsten; is she actually that slender? Or was that emaciated look done by computer to show the ravages of the pregnancy?"
"uniotofan22","Null","3","9","20 November 2011"," this movies was really good and I'm a guy saying this..surprising right?
","OK first off i went to see this with my girlfriend and 4 of my friends which 3 of my friends was a guy and 1 was a girl and then there was my girlfriend, but anyways on with the movie OK surprisingly i though well maybe this wont be good since all the reviews are saying that but actually it was an excellent movie i loved it,OK but its not like twilight-which was cheesy,romantically corny and kinda interesting but tireding,or new moon-which was full of action,laughs but still the romance level was still in away a bit corny but not as bad,then we have eclipse-which is kinda funny,interesting intensely action-packed,full of shocking moments<br/><br/>Now ill review breaking dawn part 1,OK first of all the wedding was funny,romantic and interesting,then after the wedding we go into the honeymoon and that was flat out awkward/funny,but also as I've heard some people use sexy,now i wouldn't use that because well I'm 16 and it was awkwardly funny for me especially when the bed broke haha,but my opinion would be that how did this film not get an R rating with all the sex/nudity and disturbing images in it,OK it says partial nudity but that's wrong OK because when they were in the lake you could see parts of nudity for instance the side view of Kristen Stewart,but anyways OK so the honeymoon starts int he water then goes to the Bed,and then goes to all these random kissing/making out/sexual scenes i swear there whole honeymoon Bella wanted based off sex! LOL,she kept basically begging for more but Edward didn't want to keep hurting her since he left bruises all over her body,which was kinda disturbing,but lets go after the honeymoon-or during OK so Bella asks Edward how long its been since the wedding he says 14 days and says why? she says I've missed my period? so yeah she find out shes pregnant then we go and findout shes sick/being basically eaten from the inside out because she looks really old but then Jacob comes up with a joking solution that actually works he says it wants something to sink its teeth into aka blood SO its pretty disturbing watching Bella drink cups full of blood and what makes it worse she says yum! and actaulyl gets into drinking it she doesn't think ti tastes bad so of course i yelled you bloodsucker because you can tell she wants to be a vampire because shes a human and she enjoys drinking blood,OK but anyways then we go into all the wolf- conflict,Jacob,Leah,Seth and going against there pack and blah blah blah,the reason is aid blah blah isn't because I'm bored its because there's a lot of those parts i cant spoil but i will-say an interesting/weird/funny scene that ruined the film a little but is till liked was when Jacob in wolf form was talking with his pack and arguing and they sounded like Robots loll and they growled while talking it was hard to take it seriously what i loved most about this movie is its a drama/romance and a fantasy and horror,there were some disturbing,creepy,intense and emotional scenes the wolf pack and the culelnt fight was intense/bizarre,it made me feel sorry for the Cullen's because of a huge msiunderstanding,the birth and Bella's transformation was very intense/disturbing and creepy,beautiful and mysterious but the blood level and intensity in that scene was i bet at least somewhat of an r-rating because I've never seen anything like that in a pg13 then again I've never seen so many prolonged sex scenes in a pg13 either so yeah,jacobs imprinting on renesme was beyond cool,fantasy like and romantic to an extent,it was so cool same with Bella's transformation because it showed images from all 4 movies so that was cool,oh by the way if you go to watch this stay after the credits because there's a scene with the volturi that gets you pumped up/but makes you feel the intensity coming our way for Breaking Dawn part 2,this ones more mature,dark,and creepy/disturbing then all 3 combined but creepy/disturbing wasn't in the previous 3 until this one so yeah and there was more blood then the previous 3 combined also i loved how it showed Edwards story toward the beginning it shows us a kinda dark/creepy side to Edward that we've never known before and Bella's dream sequence was horrific/creepy/disturbing/shocking and bizarrely weird but interesting OVERAll i give it 10/10 and there were plenty of great scenes I ill admit though some parts do tend to drag on a bit/slow down the pace of the film but the last 30minutes was non stop intensity/action/disturbing bloody images especially the last 10minutes"
"fmc3","9","5","19","18 November 2011"," Possibly the BEST movie for fans. NOT so great for non-fans.
","Non-fans will find this movie slow, and even boring. However, for the fans of the series, this is definitely one of the best.

Non-fans will wonder why nothing is happening, and why it is important. So everyone should expect that there will be a very great dichotomy of opinion about this movie, depending on which group is evaluating it.<br/><br/>I'm a guy, who read the books and enjoyed them, despite their obvious (though unimportant) flaws, but I wouldn't be at such an early showing if it weren't for my wife. Yet, because of my understanding of the books, I can see the beauty of how this was done.<br/><br/>If you liked the books, or like the movies, then go see this. You will enjoy it and find that it moves you. But don't be surprised that many many people won't 'get it' because EVERY bit of the ""real"" (non-emotional) action is being saved for the final movie in the series."
"imdelvian2","10","4","14","22 November 2011"," The best of the series
","I'm a twilight fan. No apologies. I've read the books, seen all the movies and discussed them many times. Breaking Dawn gave me exactly what I wanted. Which was the romance, the funny moments, the wedding, Isle Esme, the honeymoon, the pregnancy, the birth and the transformation. It toned down what I didn't want, namely the laughable wolf-pack and way too much Jacob's pov. It's all win for me. The one thing the other movies consistently lacked were the small scenes, the little interactions that made me fall in love with the books. They just hit the highlights and kept going. Here, it's slowed down and you're able to enjoy the most faithful to the book movie yet.<br/><br/>I loved that we really got to feel Bella's nervous trepidation walking down the aisle..until she saw Edward that is. Her and Edward's first time was so beautiful and the music was just perfect. The end with the birth, while not as bloody and graphic as the book was still horrifying and when Bella was transformed it left me wanting the next movie, NOW.<br/><br/>People argue constantly about bad role models, and being slow paced or it has too much of this person or that, the acting sucks yada yada. Whatever. I think it's simple. At its core it's a tale of one imperfect woman's journey and her handsome vamp boyfriend who will love her till the day he dies. I also think the actors all nailed it. Yes, including Taylor. If you love the books and Bella and Edward's love story, then this movie is for you."

","I'll start out by saying I'm a fairly decent fan of the books, and I've read Breaking Dawn about half a dozen times. The first three movies left me utterly disappointed. Kristen Stewart's acting was never very tolerable and Robert Pattinson, while I've always thought to be a decent actor, just sucks as Edward. Though maybe that's because I cannot stand the character. But Breaking Dawn Pt One caught be by surprise. Stewart's acting in this film surpasses the other three immensely. Bella and Edward's relationship has much more emotion in this one, as well. The wedding and reception scenes were sweet but light-hearted and had their funny moments. From the honeymoon on, though, we see a dark twist and the movie gets good. Bella's transformation from normal teenage girl to sickly mother of a vampire spawn is pretty intense. They do a great job of making her look like she's at the end of her life. The birth scene was a little disappointing, but what happens after Edward pulls his daughter out of his new wife is what really shocked some people. Bella's death was the most intense scene out of all four movies. This scene is what pushed me to give this movie a decent rating. She truly does look disturbing.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie. And I was surprisingly satisfied with it."

Simply just move on and leave this fan base alone to give it its comments good or bad. My review of how well this movie did to represent the book was superb against all the other movies. By breaking it up into two parts they in fact stayed with the books story completely. The actors did their job perfectly in their roles. Graphics were amazing, very detailed and time well spent. As an actor/actress they are assigned a role if they keep to their role and give the same affect as it is portrayed they did their job. Its all about the completeness of the movie different factors can turn down the move or rave it up. To me this was a hole-in-one. Can't wait to see the next one."

","Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are getting married being aware of the fact that she's a human being and he's a vampire. But love is said to conquer it all. <br/><br/>The vampire flock however is discontent with the alliance and is planning an attack. When the couple is in Brazil on their honeymoon, Bella discovers she is pregnant. Their first worry is whether the child will be a killing monster or a human baby. Bella might not survive the birth and she also dies, even if the child seems normal. But Bella comes back to life, as a vampire.<br/><br/>The film is the fourth sequence of the Twilight story by the author Stephanie Meyer telling us about Bella's and Edward's impossible love story. The film is seductive. Beautiful young people that exist only for their pleasures are exposing themselves through the film. The threat is there, otherwise there will be no adventure, but the danger is magic and with supernatural powers and therefore attractive.<br/><br/>The good and evil is not clear in the film as in the fairytale world. The vampires have got their rules and the wolf pack is constant struggling about leadership and how to punish the traitors. There are certainly parallels to the real world, but that's not of interest. The film itself has no message to its audience. It just wants to adore and scare us a bit and also manage to do so. There are some nasty scenes, but not worse that the computer games packed with murders and torture.<br/><br/>The film is well made. The costumes and settings are perfect, as taken from exclusive fashion and interior design journals. The casting is also perfect for its context. The actors look right for their rather flat film characters and play their parts as good as they can be done. <br/><br/>The graphics are however a bit edgy. The movements and expressions of the wolf vampires seem artificial, which surprises me. The graphic technology shows in the recent film an impressive development, very convincing and well added to the pictures.<br/><br/>The Twilight story is a worldwide success in books, on film and in on TV, exciting for its crossing-border issues. But this drama is too slow and boring, despite all the visual efforts. Probably because the filmmakers actually having nothing special to tell."
"samratrc1417","Null","6","26","16 November 2011"," The most sober vampire movie ever made!!
","Breaking Dawn was the best novel in the Twilight series penned by Stephanie Mayer and as I found out a little while ago Twilight Sage - Breaking Dawn Part-I might be the best movie of the lot till date. The hallmark of Twilight series is the simplicity of the plot with a great emphasis on romance, and with generous bits of vampires and werewolves thrown in together. As a Harry Potter aficionado I at first didn't like the overtly simple tone of the novels (I still think Twilight would have turned into a work of art had a writer of J.K Rowling's caliber worked on it)but the intrigues of the Bella, Edward and Jacob trinity finally roped me in. <br/><br/>As any reader would know the movie starts with Bella and Edward getting married. I have seen a lot of movie weddings but I think this one would take the cake. The wedding scenes were simply spectacular and so was the locales selected for shooting. I could see the ladies in the theater practically drooling as the sight of such magnificence. Its a girl's dream come true - marrying the man of their dreams in a fantasy wedding and honeymoon and getting an awesome family too - At 18??. Which girl doesn't dream of it (or so my wife says).<br/><br/>Then the drama started. The kids did some acting for a change. I am not saying that I saw Brando,Pacino and Hepburn in action here but given the storyline and tween premise of the movie I would say they did well. Lets give them credit. They have been playing these characters for a while now. Anyway, I wouldn't give away the story as I am sure a lot of non-readers would be watching the movie so I ask them to go and find out for themselves. Anybody can sense that part two will be a lot more action packed as I think the book envisages a Deathly Hallows and The Return of the King kind of finale. Its not in the 'Godfather' category but I'm sure even non-fans will not begrudge some praise for this one. Its a couple of hours of solid entertainment(even in the mid-east with heavy editing). So go and watch it."

","I personally think this was a major step up from the other movies, It was beautifully done. If you're looking for something ""better"" well then I'm sorry but that's impossible. This movie was Gross, Romantic, Action packed,funny, etc.I missed the cast, I missed getting excited about Twilight and this just brought every emotion back. This was very impressive. The characters all matured, it was very convincing and frankly Twilight was never meant to be a normal vampire film, its different. Its risky, I'm glad Steph decided on Vampire/demon kids, ""sparkling"" vamps because its unique not dumb. Maybe people nowadays still aren't into change."

","OK, so I am writing my review around the fact that I am a Twilight fan. If I were not a Twilight fan to begin with, however, I would still give it a 7 out of 10. I am not going to lie, I got teary-eyed during the wedding and the climactic ending had me on the edge of my seat. For the most part, the movie followed the book pretty well. They didn't add too much or take anything to vital to the plot away. It was pretty much a ""cliff notes"" adaptation of the book. After I read some of the reviews on here, I couldn't get a good, honest idea about what the film was like based on what was written. After seeing the film, I can give an honest opinion that the film is not Gone With the Wind or anything, but it was a more than decent film. The make up was fantastic, the acting was a huge improvement from the previous films, and the film had many breathtaking moments, from the wedding, to the honeymoon, to the last scene. It was by far the best film in the series thus far. If you like Twilight, go see this film and I promise you won't be disappointed!"

","If you haven't seen this movie yet then you should!!! It follows the book so much. The wedding dress is amazing, it looks exactly like how Stephanie Myers described it. The whole honeymoon scene was awesome although I would've liked a little more headboard breaking and feathers flying. I also wish it could have made the birthing scene a little better but you have to keep it pg-13. The graphics were really cool especially with the wolves. There's tons of funny lines so everyone will enjoy. Ladies, if your taking your boyfriends/husbands, they may be bored at first but once the wolves come out they'll love it. All in all this movie is awesome and I can't wait till part 2 comes out!!!"

","If you are not a Twihard or adore the books you probably will not get it. The movie is exactly what the fans wanted and the screenplay is true to the book. Bill Condon did a fabulous job. Only negative, music for the first 30 minutes is a bit cheesy-but does represent the romance. The make up was much better this movie but it was hard to watch Bella so skinny. Loved the movie, best yet. The acting has improved with each film. There were very difficult scenes to adapt but Melissa Rosenberg did it wonderfully. Even fans of the book miss a couple of details. Who actually changes Bella? Hint, its not Edward. The scene where Jacob imprints was done with such sincerity and sensitivity that it fit. The birth scene was difficult to see but the scene where Edward watches Bella get in to the bathtub was more difficult for me to watch."

","I watched this again when I stumbled across it on my TV and couldn't turn it off. This is just such a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Pretty much only fans of the series will like this as here we finally get the wedding in all its glory, including (unnecessary) close ups of the dress, jewelry and even Stephanie Meyer as a guest. And then finally Bella and Edward get down to business, with the much anticipated feathers and even a broken headboard. -More than I was expecting from the love scenes actually.<br/><br/>Of course then things go rapidly downhill for our couple and I have to say the special effect are pretty mind blowing. I mean it becomes a true horror movie as we watch Bella transform, losing a good 40 lbs (via CGI) as her fetus (sorry baby) destroys her from the inside out. And that birth scene, jeez, talk about gory.<br/><br/>They also dealt with the (creepy) imprinting issue well too, using a visions of the future aspect for Jacob. Nov21/12"

This movie did an excellent job on making you feel/understand how much Edward and Bella are in love. When you read the books that is one thing that you completely understand. This movie finally gets the point across. i think the honey moon was great...great love scenes. The special effects with Bella being sick. they did an excellent job. I have already gone to the movie twice. and i am going to see it again tonight. I love twilight. and these people are saying ""it took too long"" and ""it shows Bella and Edward kissing too much"" well than don't go see it. that is what the books are about so there for that is what the movie is about. if you love the books you will love the movie. i could have sat there longer. i think they should remake all the other ones like this one. i cant wait to own this one. i am not sure why the reviews are so bad. i just hope they don't let this effect the next movie. i hope they make it just like this one. i am happy sitting there for 3 hours for the movie.

","All of the haters just take a seat. We all get it, you hate Twilight and everything it stands (or doesn't stand) for. Whatever.<br/><br/>Take out the story line. The effects were amazing. Bella looked really sick. The wolves looked and acted better. Even the way the vampires ran fast and fought with the wolves was better. Bill Condon did an amazing job directing a movie that had THREE previous installments.<br/><br/>Shove the story back in. Was it cheesy in some moments? Definitely. Like when the wolves were yelling at each other...I felt their voices sounded like MegaTron from Transformers. Or when Jacob imprints. But when anyone takes any series and shoves it from unlimited pages in a book to a two hour time spot, things are going to get left out, mushed together and have the potential to be slightly cheesy. However, as far as the cheese factor goes, this is the LEAST cheesy. Did anyone watch the very first Twilight?<br/><br/>Will straight, single, ""manly"" men go and watch this alone? No. It's a CHICK flick. It's a GREAT chick flick. It's the best out of the saga so far. It looks great, kept all of us laughing and even though we knew there was a cliffhanger, the movie kept me satisfied until the final one comes out.<br/><br/>The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part One, may have a unreasonably long name, but it was a great movie that I will pay to see again."
"acmur","8","4","16","18 November 2011"," A lovely visualisation of the book.
","Breaking Dawn is my favorite of the four books. This is a good film of the book, delightfully capturing the essence of the first half with little detour from the source. I was pleased enough to see it in two consecutive sessions today. There's a generous sprinkling of humor amid the drama and the story sprinted to make the two hours seems very short. I could have happily sat longer for a more detailed exploration of the characters and their relationships, especially amongst the wolves. I can't imagine what people will experience without knowing the saga fairly well beforehand. I've read some negative reviews and find it amusing that anyone not caring for the previous films would see this... more fool them. My thanks to the cast and crew for bringing the book to life on the screen. I wish part 2 wasn't so far away."

","Some people can seriously over react when it comes to twilight..There are far more worse things than Twilight(Cowboys&aliens,Shark night,Piranha,The Wolf man etc). Putting someone in the love/hate category is disliked by a lot of people,but being realistic,many people belong to that category. Rating the movie 1,only because it's Twilight,or rating it 10 only because it's Twilight. If you really don't like a movie,i can respect that,but with most reviews i think that people are blinded by some kind of hate,only trying to out hate each other and to see who can screw Kristen,Robert,the producers or whatever the hardest. Lighten up man. I'm not a silly little teen girl who gets watery eyes every time she sees Robert or Taylor,i'm just a guy who read the books and has seen the movies. Overall i liked the movies,except for some off the romantic stuff,that was just a bit to much sometimes(i my eyes).And that Robert's acting looked silly in some of those scenes is kind of obvious,i don't think there is an actor who can put that perfect on screen,i think what he showed was good. Kristen's acting improved seriously i think,i was impressed at some parts in Breaking Dawn.I like it if someone can produce tears all by itself. There wasn't much dialog in the first part of the movie,but it didn't needed to and that is the strength of the movie i think. That it might is unnecessary to split it up in two parts is one thing,but you can't blame them,it's a new trendy thing in Hollywood. Don't let the reviews from other people influence you to much and just go see it,you like it or you don't,but don't get your're judgment on before you have seen it,that's not fair for your yourself and the creators. Just be reasonable,don't be like the dumb ass in a other review that said to leave your're girlfriend when she asks you to go see twilight."
"mollidew","10","3","11","22 November 2011"," Funny, paranormal romance
","I wonder if anyone realizes these books that spawned the movies are labeled for ""children,' and not adults. The books have received many awards under the child category. If adults cannot get into them that may be the reason. I think the films are great and I am neither a child nor one of the young adults constantly complaining about something with these films. I am a senior and I thoroughly enjoyed all the films. As for the books, well Meyer is a good story teller and a beginning writer. Books cannot fully translate to the screen and after all they are made to make money. My daughter works in management in a movie theater and the film is popular, so much so in a theater that doesn't generally have a lot of attendance it has been packed for days to view this film and more people keep streaming in. I believe they toned down the film for the sake of younger people who have read the books and would like to see the movies. Even Meyer was made to tone down the books by editors. It has always been geared generally for a younger audience but when put into film it really should have been reconciled and gone for the adult audience is my only criticism.<br/><br/>I laughed through the wedding in various parts not because it was silly but it was cute the way they did the speakers part. I knew what was coming and I think they did a good job. This is a romance movie that has vampires and shape shifters in it. This type of genre is generally labeled paranormal romance. The last part should be more to the taste of die hard vampire movie fans but let me tell you, all vampire stories are fiction and made up. So people should get over ridiculing these stories. What they show is very clever and entertaining.<br/><br/>You have to take the films on their own merit and not judge them by the books at all. I found Stewart and Pattinson to be good at carrying over the way they portrayed their characters. I think this movie shows the vampire in a more humanistic manner which throws off many people but that is what I like about them...to me it makes sense. <br/><br/>I also liked the fact they brought in other vampires as an extension of their family and how they mixed everyone together getting along for the sake of the two who just got married. I didn't feel the movie dragged on at all and liked the detour to the island off of Brazil to be very tender in nature with each main character dealing with their insecurities and Bella being a virgin with no prior idea of what to expect and especially with a vampire that didn't want to hurt her. The dynamic is unusual and makes for the entertainment value of the movie. Over all I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and await the second half. Try to keep in mind the story is an extension of a vampire clan that has made their choice not to kill humans but it is a side issue to the romance between Bella and Edward so therefore if you don't like romance movies with a paranormal twist, you won't like this movie. I think it was excellent."
"wild-yennifer","9","3","11","22 November 2011"," The crew performed on the highest level
","I am a fan of Twilight books, for I admire Stephenie's writing style, and as for the movies, I used to consider them a nice addition to the books, since none of them really reflected the book plot and details - that is, until Breaking Dawn.<br/><br/>Ms Rosenberg must be praised first of all for sticking to the book and finding a perfect balance between an exact reproduction of the book and creating a story which would be amusing to look at. Can't but add a point my friend expressed - if this is your first Twilight movie, you will hardly get the point - although why one would watch BD without the previous movies I can't imagine.<br/><br/>The cast performs on the highest level. Kristen Stewart portrays all confused emotions Bella experiences in a very believable way, and the scenes in which she has to cry are so touching you may also get upset. Robert Pattinson also does a great job - with his face all happy and amused in the first half of the movie, and then when he learns about the baby, it turns into a mask till he hears the baby's thoughts. Some consider it lack of acting, but I believe that's the way Stephenie imagined a vampire ""in shock"". Taylor Lautner with his brand-new stubble looks more mature which is very suitable for the situation. The supporting cast, not to mention every single person, can also be commended.<br/><br/>As for the characters, I must mention this movie changed my opinion on Jacob. I know it's not how he was designed, but he used to irritate me a lot with all his first-do-then-think pranks. Here, however, we get a much closer look at his personality. He still makes mistakes, but he also arrives at right conclusions, makes important decisions and in general tries to behave very wisely. The character of Leah is developed extremely well. We see her struggle as she tries to fight her inherent hatred for the Cullens for the sake of Seth, and eventually we see her overcome it during the fight between the Cullens and the werewolves - she pushes another wolf off Alice.<br/><br/>The most memorable scenes for me were: ""toasts"" at the wedding; Bella preparing for the first night with Edward (Kristen illustrated the nervousness in such a humorous and touching way, and the soundtrack was incredible); then of course the lovemaking (Pattinson said it was little for him, but well, if they showed more, the movie would be NC-17, definitely); Jake ""overpowering"" Sam and refusing to obey his orders - it was done in such a simple and yet genius way; the fight between the Cullens and the werewolves; Jake imprinting on Renesmee (nicely done, with flashbacks, flash-forwards and amazing editing) and Bella turning into a vampire - it was fascinating how her body was being healed by the venom, and the last thing we get to see on the screen is her pale face with crimson eyes opening. <br/><br/>Tip 1: don't miss a chance to watch it on the big screen - some scenes were just meant for that. Tip 2: if you aren't a native-speaker of English but your English is good enough, watch the original. I've already watched two translated versions and there was a number of ridiculous mistakes in the translation."
"amcanrer","9","3","11","21 November 2011"," Saga Saved with Return of Original Twilight Charm
","I didn't anticipate BD1 with much interest. I didn't buy my tickets early, didn't plan to attend the midnight opening, didn't watch the first three movies last week in preparation. In fact, I just saw BD1 this afternoon, five days into the run, in a nearly empty theater, and only because I had to out of respect for the books. <br/><br/>I'm a champion of the books. If you read more than the first installment of Twilight, then you understand the fascination of the story - the situational and moral complications, the historic development of the characters, the ""how the heck is this going to be resolved?"" hook. The movies naturally suffer from the problem of bringing a novel to the screen.<br/><br/>The first Twilight movie seemed a fluke. Its low budget, independent director, unknown ensemble of actors and lots of influence from the author, Stephenie Meyer, and thousands of passionate book fans came together and miraculously created an artful, quirky, and very cool film with an awesome soundtrack.<br/><br/>But the franchise was born and big bucks created two terrible sequels, New Moon and Eclipse. They had none of the magic that was Twilight.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn 1 brings back the magic! The great musical score and soundtrack are back, the costumes and art direction are gorgeous, and the actors are an ensemble once again. My only complaint is that it is over-edited. I'm all for cutting movies to the essentials, but BD1 could have lingered a bit more on many scenes. For instance, Edward's back story (involving a scene from The Bride of Frankenstein) is so briefly told that I doubt it makes sense to anyone who doesn't know the book. Bella's deterioration during pregnancy is amazing (how did they do that?), but the director wimped out on showing the audience how Edward got the baby out (and why he had to it that way). Rather than explaining imprinting through the story, Jacob's imprinting is pretty much communicated to us, insufficiently, through Edward. It just seemed too rushed. And why? The film is only 108 minutes. If its audience is committed fans, why not give us more? <br/><br/>Overall, I not only enjoyed the movie, I was impressed with it. Bella's transformations, the excellent cast, the flashbacks, the soundtrack and score were all on the mark. Then I saw that it was produced by Stephenie Meyer herself. She must be the charm that was lacking in 2 and 3. So congratulations to Ms Meyer for producing a movie that gives us what we loved about the first film.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the midnight opening of BD2!"

This movie was really good, and a lot of people are saying that they added to much stuff to the movie and could have made it shorter, you guys have no idea what you are talking about; this shows that most of you people have obviously not read the books! I absolutely loved the book, and was kinda of disappointed with the amount of scenes that they CUT OUT and/ or SHORTENED!!! There were scenes that I was actually looking forward to watching. I understand that this movie can't be extremely long, but some of the other movies were like 2 and a half hours, and this movie wasn't even 2 hours. I really did enjoy this film, but I really wish that they would have added some of those additional scenes. Also, most people, for some reason, just don't really want to read the books, (they are really good and you should read them) and if you haven't, then you probably didn't understand some of it because without those additional scenes or additional parts of scenes, they didn't really do a good job of explaining some stuff. Even though I am saying all of this, I still really did enjoy the movie, it's just that a lot of reviews are saying that they should have shortened it, which really makes me mad because they have no idea what they are talking about, and should really read the books! If you haven't seen it you totally should, and if you haven't read the books, please do!!! They are so good, and the movies can't tell someone that the books aren't amazing, because they are!!

","Alright, I've read the books and seen the movies. I have never been a ""Twi-hard"" fan, but I definitely enjoy the books and the films that follow.<br/><br/>This franchise is simply created to bring in the money. After seeing the first three movies, I had no high expectations on this fourth installment. I'm well aware that the dialogue is ridiculously cheesy (especially on Taylor Lautner's end). I've seen a majority of these actors in other films and they are, in fact, pretty damn good. However, with the cheesy dialogue in the Twilight series, not even Robert de Niro can deliver those lines and make them sound good. But, let's face it...the storyline is what draws the fans in, not the poor script. Throw in some hot actors and you got yourself a box office hit.<br/><br/>I found Kristen Stewart to be SO much more tolerable in this film than in any other. As goes for Taylor Lautner. That dude usually can't act to save his life, but even HE was better in this film. Robert Pattinson has pretty much stayed the same throughout the 4 films and held his own. Can't say the same for ANYONE in the wolf pack.<br/><br/>Out of the entire film, there was only one scene that was incredibly awful and I was laughing the whole time because it was just uncomfortable. That was the wolf scene with all the telepathy. My god, they could have done that SO much differently and made bearable. If that's how the wolf telepathy is, then I'm glad that they left that out of the films this whole time. There was supposed to be much more of that according to the book and I am happy to say that they only kept that one scene.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, I enjoyed it. The wedding was stunning (as was the back of Bella's dress) and the birth was gruesome but in the best way. And I think anyone will agree that watching Bella turn into a vampire was pretty awesome with the CGI. Overall, I think this movie depicted the book far better than the previous three. If you've read the book, go see the film."

I might not belong to the target market (being over 30, married and with a child, though, maybe I actually am the target :-)), but I must say I could 100 % connect with Bella and her protective attitude as well as I could understand Edwards anger over his incapability to do anything and I even understood and believed Jacob's pain. I liked the way Edward was capable of being angry at all (different from book). What I didn't like, was the length of the first ""romantic"" hour, this could and should have been shortened to 30 minutes and the remaining 30 minutes could have been filled with more wolf - talk (which could have been done much better, too) and/or more insight into Bella's and Edward's inner world.

","While I agree with some people's opinions that this movie was by far the best in the series; I don't agree that there is no reason to see the Part 2 of this last book. If you have read the books, you will understand the reason for the second part. If you read the books you should also know that the second part has more excitement than the first. I don't know that I would watch Part 1 again because the movie cut a lot out of the movie that was in the book, particularly scenes and information with the Quileute Wolves. Part 1 did have some touching scenes but some scenes were poorly executed; again this deals with the Wolves. The voice over sounded like cartoon voices. I think it would have been better if they would have used the actors' real voices instead of altering them."

It was of course still a romantic movie whose strongest and main message is one of selfless love and sacrifice, but having read the books I knew what to expect and I was fine with that. What I am not fine with, is the fact that some people, can tolerate a romantic novel but seem hell-bent on stepping all over a romantic movie. It's very simple to me; you know what you like, go watch that. This isn't a movie for everyone, but those who appreciate it's message, will surely enjoy it and find fewer faults in it. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this one better than all the previous ones; it went smoother, it didn't bore me more than it I could take and even the actors seemed to have taken a few acting classes since the last one. I almost believed K. Stewart as Bella this time around. Well, almost; I still think she was a poor choice of casting along with Taylor Lautner. I especially enjoyed the fact that the soundtrack from the first movie made a comeback in this one. I liked the original music. <br/><br/>I'm more excited to be looking forward to seeing the finale after watching this one now; I know there's more to enjoy as this story comes to an end. <br/><br/>A 9/10 from me just to wind up some people:-)"

","I don't know why i'm making myself suffer like this.
This movie is the worst Twilight movie to ever be created.<br/><br/>PACING
The pacing is so slow.
They drag this movie out for so long to reach that near 2 hour mark for some reason.
This movie could have been an hour long but they dragged it out.
The plot is that Bella is pregnant and that he want's to keep the baby but it will kill her, that's it and it's not something that you need to make a 2 hour movie about.<br/><br/>TONE
The tone is inconsistent.
In the beginning it looked to be a positive love story between Edward and Bella. I wasn't looking forward to it cause i can't stand them being together, but then after being a positive love story between them two they make a complete 180 and it becomes this dark drama instead.
It wasn't executed properly in my opinion cause it went light to dark really quick it didn't build up to be something dark.
Stuff can get light to dark quick but those should just be dark moments not a second half of a movie.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Bella is the most annoying and manipulative user i have ever seen.
For the first she pushes Edward to have sex even though he dosen't want to and that is enough to prove how sickening she is.
Jacob has gotten worse cause he is always mad and grumpy and it gets annoying.
I mean he changed as a character giving him a character arc but he just got more annoying.
And Edward is just being Edward doing Edward stuff and is all over the manipulator named Bella.<br/><br/>VERDICT
I could just quit now it would be easier for me but i will watch this last movie and review it, i heard that it was bad but fun so i wont die of the bad pacing hopefully."

Ultimately, I find that it does what I want it to do â€“ give an on-screen representation of what I envisioned in the books and allow me to experience the story visually. Like the somewhat obsessive nature the books depict, I confess to an inexplicable, somewhat addictive relationship with the novels. And ultimately, the movie does what I want it toÂ… it gives a good visual ""hit"" to my addiction. I'm not ecstatic, but I am satisfied. <br/><br/>What I loved: 1. The stunningly beautiful wedding 2. The wedding-prep scenes 3. Bella's exquisite dress. Undeniable. I was hoping that they wouldn't put her in some sorry excuse for a designer gown that actually looks horrible. They didn't and I'm SO glad! She looked stunning - undeniably alluring while maintaining an essence of purity. The more I looked at it, the more I loved it. 4. Charlie and Rene's spot-on performances. 5. The honeymoon awkwardness. 6. Edward was entirely believable throughout. One of my favorite moments in the film happens when Edward calls Bella to task for making a unilateral decision when, in fact, marriage is supposed to be about compromise and two people working together. I found the comment and its delivery profound and insightful. 7. Bella's beautiful lullaby theme from movie #1 was brought back and served to weave continuity between all three films. I also LOVED the flashbacks to the other films. They remind us of the characters' history and our history with them. This was one of my most favorite aspects of the movie. 8. Finally, I liked the initial images and sounds when Jacob phases into his wolf form after discovering that Bella's pregnant. <br/><br/>What I didn't love: The script was SERIOUSLY lacking in the 2nd half of the film. It didn't support or provide an explanation for why Jacob continues to return to Bella even after he's said he isn't sticking around to witness her slow death. This could have been easily managed via conversation with either Seth's character or with Leah's character, but it's left out completely and as a viewer, we're left to ""fill in"" Jacob's motivations on our own. <br/><br/>The conversation between Jacob and Leigh when she is explaining that she's willing to help him through his upcoming grief is entirely omitted in favor of Leah's explanation that she would prefer to be unwanted in Jacob's pack rather than be unwanted in Sam's pack. This interaction was entirely underwhelming. I found Leah's performance, something that had the potential to be gritty, painful and pack some serious punch wasÂ… lacking. Bland. I didn't grow into compassion for Leah's character and this was the opportunity to do so. Rather, I am left seeing her as a cardboard cut-out of a person, stuck on the screen because she's a partially relevant piece of the novel. I say this, feeling somewhat guilty for the criticism because I like the actress, she seems sweetÂ… but her performance in this case left me wishing for a lot more. <br/><br/>The script did not support Jacob! Having grown to care about this character, I felt that the script really let him down. I had a difficult time understanding his feelings. So much was left to facial expression and while that's great much of the time, in this case because Jacob has so much distance to cover as he shifts from his love of Bella to his utter devotion to Renesme, the script really needed to be there to support him and it just wasn't. <br/><br/>The wolf pack. CGI â€“ what happened?!?! The CGI pulled me right out of the movie! I could not maintain the illusion in the face of its awfulness. Given the money these films make, couldn't Summit have put a bitÂ… OK, a LOT more effort into making the wolves look realistic? They did a thousand times better in Eclipse! We're regressing? Really? Unbelievable. The wolves looked horrible. I just couldn't get over it. Adding to my dislike of the wolves was the funky ""Darth Vader"" rumble-y scratch-i-tude that they used to modify the voices of each member of the wolf pack. I am left shaking my head in amazement. Anything would have been better than this! Might I suggest this simple solution: Silence firstÂ… much in the way the book depicts. It would have been easy to achieve by keeping the pounding foot beats, add heart beats, add a clamber of voices and cut to sudden silence. <br/><br/>For the argument scene following,in an effort to represent the plurality of the pack mind, make each character shout his/her lines, and then play with the sound in order to pull one voice to the forefront while moving the others to the background at a much lower volume. This seems like such a straightforward option and so much better than ruining the actors voices with really, really, bad tech-modifications."
"evan_harvey","Null","3","12","18 November 2011"," Not too bad
","I read some reviews of this that panned it, and at the time of writing this review, it's got a score of 3.8 on IMDb. It's not actually that bad.<br/><br/>Synopsis (spoilers ahoy!): Edward and Bella get married. Bella gets preggers. There's a werewolf & vampire fight. Bella becomes a vampire.<br/><br/>Overall, the story was reasonably handled. The start of the film is a bit dull - it's the wedding part, and the dialogue is very weak. It's also not too interesting, and I wondered if the screenwriter couldn't have livened it up a bit. There's at least some attempt at humour, but it's a bit forced (Kellan Lutz gets the best line in this part).<br/><br/>The honeymoon scenes are a bit dull too. I felt that the director really missed some nuances here that would have elevated the film. Such as where Edward and Bella play chess (presumably if she wins he'll have sex with her again), but it's a tad emotionless. When the audience realises what is at stake in the chess games, it's already too late, and the opportunity for real impact has been lost.<br/><br/>This part of the film also seems to focus on Edward and Bella, and if that doesn't interest you, it'll feel long and dull. I did hope we'd see a bit of Kristen Stewart nude, but alas, it's all well-placed arms and just-out-of-camera shots. Apparently they had to tone it down for the coveted PG-13 rating, so maybe there'll be some spicy extended scenes on DVD.<br/><br/>But it gets better! Once Bella is knocked up, it actually adds some more tension to the film. Will she die? Will she live? Who knows? Well, if you've read the book, you know. This part was handled pretty well, although I felt that the film lost the impact of the book at the crucial scene. Maybe it'll be picked up in the next part.<br/><br/>The wolves are back, but one of the main plot scenes is them communicating in wolf-thought, and it doesn't quite work.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I felt that the screenwriter missed some vital points that, while not really altering the direction of the film, would have helped. For instance, after learning that Bella is up the duff, Edward comments that they'll get the ""thing"" out of her. Bella repeats this to herself. Whist the intent (to me at least) was clear - Bella sees it as a child, not a ""thing"" - the scene could have benefited from a simple line like ""It's my/our child"" or some such. Whether director or screenwriter, it's another of those simple nuanced moments that would have produced a more satisfying film (as long as you can get past the whole Twihard/sappiness bit, that is).<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I thought it was going to suck harder than a vacuum, but I was pleasantly surprised. You know what it is. It's not like it's going to ultimately be any better than the other films in the series. It's more Twilight. But, for what it's worth, it wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>7 out of 10.<br/><br/>On a final note, I still think the that the first film was the best. Not that the story was any better than the others, but it had a really good style and look/colour palette to it that the others have eschewed for a more mainstream/brighter feel. The director of the first one should have kept going, and I'd like to have seen how they'd have turned out."
"daddysbabygirl1294","7","2","7","4 March 2012"," Best one
","I actually enjoyed this one! My expectations were super low. I saw Twilight and thought it was good, New Moon was not good but was not terrible. When I watched Eclipse I was like ""What on earth just happened?!"" I took my younger sister to see this on her 15th birthday, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It was much better than the first three. There were some awkward moments, for example, the talking wolves scene everyone keeps talking about.The ""sex scene"" was awkward as well just because they were trying to keep it PG-13. Other than that it was good and the last 20min kept me at the edge of my seat. I do have to say I'm actually looking forward to part 2."
"phd_travel","7","2","7","24 November 2011"," Beautifully filmed - but
","I am a huge Twilight fan and I enjoyed it. They did some things really well. There are a couple of faults.<br/><br/>Good points: The wedding is lovely. The natural setting in the woods was magical. Liked how they used music from the first Twilight movie. The back of her wedding dress was nice but the front was a bit severe and matronly. Overall photography is quite pretty throughout. The beach house in Brazil is stunning and the beach and waterfall are quite magical. For those who want to see the two kissing you sure get a lot of it. The love making scenes are not over the top quite chaste in fact. <br/><br/>The humor when there is some is quite unexpected like what happened to the bed.<br/><br/>The makeup and effects used for making Bella gaunt and sick were very convincing. <br/><br/>The wolves move quite naturally and don't look too gigantic or CGI.<br/><br/>Faults: Didn't like the wolves vs vampires over the baby issue. Felt unnecessary melodramatic and contrived. It feels like much ado about nothing and the wolves were taking themselves too seriously. But I suspect that is a story fault not a fault with the movie making. <br/><br/>The Cullen house keeps changing in appearance - I know they switched houses but it just looks too different. <br/><br/>The whole birth was kind of gross and gory with all the blood and stuff. Bella's suffering was too drawn out. The romance was kind of nullified after that. Left a down feeling in the end. <br/><br/>After waiting a year I wish they had just had one movie instead of 2 parts - there isn't enough story to break into 2 parts. Felt a bit draggy at times and it wouldn't have been if it had moved faster. But everyone knows why it had to be split up $$$.<br/><br/>Not much vampire action - got to wait for part 2 for that. <br/><br/>K Stew looks a bit too worried for too much of the first part that is supposed to be happy and romantic. She should have looked more excited and really happy for some scenes. <br/><br/>Taylor's scowling is a bit repetitive. Another story fault though.<br/><br/>Overall of course if you are a fan you have to see it. Beautiful filming but not enough story for a whole movie. On the downside there is some heaviness and a depressive vibe in the second half. I still liked the first Twilight movie the most because it was fun and exciting and romantic. This one gives a bit of a bitter aftertaste but hopefully taken with the second part it will seem better as a whole. Is it as good as it should be? Probably - not much better or worse given the restrictions of the story."
"forgotmypassword2009","8","3","13","20 November 2011"," 50/50
","To be honest, I can't see someone who wasn't obsessive over the series for at least two years enjoying this film. I think that the director did a brilliant job considering the specifications he was given. However, I don't think that the essence of this book was properly captured because of the difficult subject of childbirth, sex, and all of the problems that really occurred. This film should definitely been rated a 15 and that would have allowed more leeway for the storyline. I'm 14 and when I went to watch this film I felt a bit awkward that there were eight year olds all around me, watching the fairly explicit sex scenes. Pg-13 was the wrong choice for this film, and the saga was never meant for anyone under about 13, and that should have been made clearer earlier on.<br/><br/>However, after being completely immersed in the saga since the release of the first film, I thought that this was a great delivery of it in the motion picture. I DO BELIEVE that this did actually live up to it's name, and no-one can be blamed for some of he issues. The actors were as good as always, and the fans were I was at LOVED it. It was beautiful, and that is why it's worth a ten. The film was mostly criticised for the moral side of it, and not for the film itself."

","If you have read the book you know what to expect , And bill condo gave more than what was expected , and a lot was expected , trust me I had ask fan and they said that the movie was perfect , the end was excellent , because even thought they were not expecting it to be like that it was really good , Because it was set up for the next movie , when Bella open her eyes and the movie sort of ended they went off wanting more , wish was exactly what bill was hopping for (or at lest that's what I think ) . So if you a fan you will love it , but if your a hater , hater got to hate .<br/><br/>Also I thinking is a 10/ 10 because if you had read the book Breaking Dawn , you will See how Mr. Condon feet almost everything in, from the the wedding , the honeymoon, the separation of the pack , the pregnancy , the birth of Renesmee aka Nissie , to the most expected transformation ... Bella's . Also let not for get the little fight that set the wolf pack vs the Cullens . :) <br/><br/>from my point of view the movie is wroth watching"
"neighborlee","10","2","8","1 March 2012"," Unfolding story of learning about our place in the world
","For many movies we see a lot of negative/positive comments, and that is to be expected in life, where few are the same, and uniqueness is rampant. When the plot involves love, something private for most of us , then it shouldn't be surprising to see often negative comments, about a otherwise wonderfully crafted movie both in terms of writing and acting , and everything in between.<br/><br/>I fell in love with the entire series from the beginning, not because its sappy teen love or contains amazing special effects/makeup art, but because of the story it conveys to the reader/movie goer. It's not a story about superficial love and having sex, its about the journey of getting somewhere fulfilling and non superficial; of self discovery In this fast paced world, sometimes we forget there is more to love than just the act itself, that it embraces the better part of ourselves, that has no relation to hot lights & pornography , that instead its a story unfolding of interpersonal relationships and the growing as human beings in the process.<br/><br/>I suspect like you, we am drawn to the charisma, the hope and the expectation that its going to have the proverbial 'happy ending'. Isn't that what most of us watch movies for honestly, to see some variation on that theme, and if we don't acquire it, hope that the movie contains some message about why ; because after all the happy ending isn't set in stone, and at least discovery, not always from ourselves can be a blessing in disguise as we all set out to discover who we are, and where we fit in in this sometimes fragile existence we call life.<br/><br/>That's in part what entertainment is all about, and this latest offering in the series, does not let down."
"rapagliaro","10","2","8","24 February 2012"," I loved the movie, a must see!
","I have read a lot of bad reviews about this movie, just like the other twilight movies, but I found this movie to be much better than I expected. The wedding at the beginning was very sweet and touching, and the honeymoon phase..well Bella(Kristen Stewart) did seem kinda desperate for Edward, but still wasn't that bad. You also see Jacob's feelings for Bella, and Bella shows how much she cares for him as well. The birthing scene was a little more graphic than I thought, but it kept me on my seat. I thought when reading the book that Jacob imprinting on a baby was disgusting and questioned why she wrote that, however, the movie shows how he sees her in the future and how much he will love her, and that is why he is imprinted to Renesme. I loved the movie overall and it was very sweet and touching. I just wonder, pretty much most of the 4th book was in the 1st part, i don't know what they are going to put in the 2nd part, but i will have to wait and see :)"
"haterofcrap","10","2","8","8 February 2012"," Great addition to the spectacular Twilight franchise
","This movie was beautiful and moving. It was an excellent addition to the spectacular Twilight franchise.<br/><br/>I had all the good element from the previous Twilight films, and it seems like the beginning for a epic, dramatic conclusion of the Twilight saga, which is one of the best franchises in the history of modern cinema. No, I'm not kidding, or being sarcastic: Just like many terrible action flicks are way over-hyped, the ""Twilight"" films are underrated and under-appreciated. (And personally I think that the books were underrated too, specially on the Internet)<br/><br/>This was one of the best romantic films ever made, and it was one of the best films that I've seen in the recent years. I cannot wait to see the sequel. This movie was just magnificent.<br/><br/>By the way: I am the only one who noticed the little ""Avatar"" homage made at the end of the movie (Notice the close-up at the eyes of Bella in the last frame of the movie and compare it with the ending of Avatar) Anyway, it was a nice reference.<br/><br/>""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" was a well directed and enjoyable film. Honestly, I don't see why it receive so much hate and bad reviews."
"Malka770","8","2","8","10 December 2011"," Twilighter at heart but disappointed
","The only reason why I gave this movie a 8 is because Im a Twilight fan. <br/><br/>I've seen all the previous movies from the series and nothing compares to the first film hands down; it was haunting, it lured you in, the music was spot on. Breaking Dawn was a disappointment cause I was expecting more even though it stayed true to the book. <br/><br/>Pros: Follows the book almost perfectly, its all about Bella and Edward,lots of romance,The fabulous house and location in the first bit OMG unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Cons: The score(music) was mediocre compares to the last 3. They have to stop putting so much white makeup on Edward!<br/><br/>Bill Codon is satisfactory but what they should have done was bring back the director from the first film Catherine Hardwicke... her vision was way cooler<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend this movie if you are Twilight fan or a sucker for romance and adventure :)"
"chrissielioness","6","2","8","27 November 2011"," I liked Breaking Dawn, so what?
","OK so the Twilight Saga has had the Marmite effect: you either love it or you hate it, and I have to confess I like the books and the films. Of course there are some elements that are predictable when it comes to theme and plot, but sometimes it's great to love the cheese and the trashy romance; its easy to like and to follow. So all the films have their own charm, and Breaking Dawn Part 1 has the satisfying charm the fans have all craved since the films began. Also it is very different from the others in the sense that it has entered another phase: not only going deeper into the relationship but it also goes to a darker place than the rest. Bella and Edward finally get married and take their love into the next phase: physical intimacy. But after three films they finally face death up close and this encounter is taken a lot more seriously this time round. The other charming detail about the film is that Bill Condon has left in the little things that girls, who enjoy the story or in general, can relate to. For example a small part from the book has been kept in the film where Bella has a 'human moment' to herself to ""prepare"" for what is about to happen. These are the details, I believe, are great to include and are the kind of things that make us smile. The second half of the film, I felt, was the first time Robert Pattinson displayed Edward's absolute devotion and unconditional love for Bella, especially his reaction at the possibility of facing forever without her. <br/><br/>So yes, as you can tell, The Twilight saga is a guilty pleasure of mine and I will say it proudly. It may not be a masterpiece in everybody's eyes but it's a lovely read, a good watch and supplies people with a visual of the fantasies they may already have. I personally praise anyone who has a guilty pleasure whether it may be vampires, werewolves or trashy romances!"
"kuklenkoa","8","2","8","27 November 2011"," Twilight Breaking Dawn
","Having never read any of the Twilight books and having only seen the last three films because I was encouraged to do so, I have to admit that this is one of the better films of the year.<br/><br/>Having seen the earlier Twilight films before this one I believe that Kristen Stewart for one, has come along greatly as an actress and was able to adapt very well to the character of Bella. She is able to demonstrate the upset, worry, emotional struggle and silent strength of the character very well, and I believed this made her a more believable character than ever before.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Taylor Launtner seems to have come on leaps and bounds (no pun intended) in terms of getting the aggressive and yet caring Jacob out, without becoming too much of an eye candy. Further to this, Robert Pattinson, who I felt was a little tame in Eclipse especially, seemed to really change and improve, much like Stewart, and prove that there is a greater interest for the cinematic audience within his character. He proved that Edward does not simply jump from tree to tree and shout at people, but that he has a deeper side to him built upon his emotions for Bella.<br/><br/>The story itself has greatly improved as well. Whilst the last films seemed to be all about who Bella should love and the ongoing frustration/emotional misunderstanding between Jacob and Edward, the latest instalment in the Twilight Saga has a far great plot within it, based upon the changes and fears of going from human to vampire, the unity of more than one 'unhuman' species and the difference that life brings as one grows greater with their knowledge.<br/><br/>If we look past the common accusation that this is just another teen flick, or one 'for the girls' then we see that this is a film that has a strong story line, far more grown up and developed characters, and a 'part one' that manages to leave us wanting to see part two immediately, as opposed to other fictional series (Harry Potter). Breaking Dawn Part 1 was a very enjoyable film for myself, and it does not bother me that I was one of the only men in the cinema watching it, because it holds a story that reflects issue of real life, intertwined with that of the fantasy realm, and because of this, and the character development, I am eagerly anticipating Part two in the cinema, and I have, since watching the film, read the majority of the last book."
"Leeway-C-95","6","2","8","26 November 2011"," Breaking Dawn Part 1: Well-Made, Melodrammatic but Mature...
","THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN PART 1 (EXTENDED EDITION) Movie Review: ""After the successful third edition into the series, Eclipse; which has been received with better to positive reviews from major critics and appraisal from an estimated 83,693,746 fans, much expectation was directed towards Academy Award winning Bill Condon. This new director succeeds almost certainly but this soap-operatic film falls in some ways that made Eclipse such a guilty pleasure to watch."" The story continues with Bella Swan finally making the decision to marry and live eternally with her beloved Edward Cullen, with the disapproval of Jacob Black the buff childhood sweet heart, a werewolf as well, whom she dumps for because her love for Edward is unending even though he left her heart broken in New Moon, the second movie/book, causing her to become suicidal such as risking her life to see a faint image of Edward. Bella marries Edward, consumes a half-human, half-vampire child during their honeymoon, deteriorates slowly due to the rapid growth of the baby in which is tearing her apart inside, and the whole Cullen family has to worry about their shaky treaty with the werewolves, the Quileute tribe. All in all, the story sounds a bit more mature than the three previous films because more is at stake and the conflict is more grave than the decision between Bella's love over her two suitors. However, sadly, Breaking Dawn-Part 1 seems to be more in the same veins as New Moon. The film is directed better, the story is grim, the production designs are well made and the actors are marginally better than before, but why does it sometimes feel like a lackluster? The Actors: 1.0 credit They have been swooning and moody for the past three films, especially the central character Bella Swan. I like her character because she represents the average neighborhood girl. Her yearning in Twilight is understandable and relates to many. Her pain in New Moon is sometimes a bore but relatable. She gradually matures in Eclipse. Finally, in Breaking Dawn Part 1, she gets to play a deteriorated mother of an unknown child that could represent danger and the end to her life. The credit goes to Kristen Stewart. This is her better role so far as Bella Swan. We are able to feel her sense of determination and yet see her outward appearance which might shock some viewers. Her high cheek bones, her bony structure, her darken eyes, and her raspy-low voice. Thanks to the designers and visual effects. Edward and Jacob, both, act the usual with Edward moping voice and Jacob's cracked voice. The Visual Effects and Production Values: 1.0 credit Bella's body is something of a disgusting fascination, her performance also adds to the finishing touch; make up and computer detailing. The Wedding Scene in the beginning is well staged and beautifully mossy yet rich, over the top looking. The fight that ensues in the end is watchable but only shortly. Overall, this seems like an expensive soap opera movie. The Ending: 1.0 credit Gruesome Birth scene of a screaming Bella Swan only adds to the horror of what is happening below the stomach. In fact, Rosalie does a risky C-Section while Edward shoots morphine up her arms and legs. Blood is everywhere, which is a difficult situation especially delivering a half-vampire, half human baby in the company of vampires, and the audience can cringe to the sounds of bones crushing, heavy breathing and saliva spitting everywhere from Bella's mouth. We then see a dying Bella lying lifeless on the bed. The camera work and lighting are things that add up to the horror and terrifying 10 minutes experience of Bella giving birth and Edward trying to revive her. This is one of the better scenes I have ever seen in any movie so far about a female character trying to deliver a baby (besides Rosemary's Baby). The ending keeps you at the edge of your seat. Overall. 3/5 Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a better film; in the design, the visual effects, a bravura performance from Kristen Stewart and an engaging first and last 20 minutes. However, it still feels like a complete letdown from Eclipse; the performances from the other characters, the pacing is slow, and the dialogue still remains indifferent. Yet, I hope that the last part of this series will shoot me out with a bang"
"melihoku09","9","2","8","26 November 2011"," It's not THAT terrible..
","I have read all the books and seen all the movies. Twilight: was okay, not terrible and not great. New Moon: Horrific mess. Terrible acting and dialogue. Eclipse: Better but still nothing special. Breaking Dawn Part 1: The best of the series so far.<br/><br/>Now before people start going ""Oh, she has no taste"" or ""She has no clue what she is talking about"" let me explain.<br/><br/>First, lets starting with the acting and dialogue in general. It was 1000 times better than any of the other movies. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have finally shown us that they are not the stiff cardboard's they appeared to be in the first 3 movies. You can tell that Bill Condon was able to break them of their horribly awkward style. The dialogue was still corny in some parts, but for those of us that have read the books we ALL know that is how the books are too!! You can't escape the basic overall story-line. If they had deviated from the story people would be complaining about that too.<br/><br/>Second, for those of you who are saying ""Oh my god all they did was get married and have a baby. Why did they need a whole Part 1 for that"". THAT'S WHAT THE FIRST HALF OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT! I mean c'mon people, yes it's annoying but really? Of all the things you could complain about this is the first thing you can think of. Read the book, understand the story and just get over it.<br/><br/>Third, for the ""twi-hards"" yes some stuff was left out. The terrible blonde jokes that Jacob tells Rosalie, Rosalie making a dog food bowl for Jacob, the more in depth part of the pack life. We need to remember that it is a movie and not everything can be included.<br/><br/>My opinion, the movie as a whole was good. Yes there were those corny moments as well as the awkward ones. I appreciated that a lot of the dialogue from the book made it to the movie. Some things could have been included and some left out. Every one of the actors had some decent lines in the movie but the stand outs in my opinion were Kellan Lutz, Jackson Rathbone, Elizabeth Reaser and Boo-Boo Stewart. They could have been utilized way more."
"raychelltheangel","7","2","8","26 November 2011"," What did you expect?
","The first time I watched Twilight I hated it. I couldn't relate to the story of a moody, dull girl who somehow becomes irresistible to a glittering, tree climbing vampire. When I made this gripe to my friend she said to me, ""It's a fantasy film what did you expect?"" When she said that I instantly realized I was taking the film way too seriously and should just take it for what it is. Sorry, but if you've seen the other films in the series you should know you're not going to be watching Academy Award worthy performances. Breaking Dawn is a bit different from the previous films. The storyline has moved passed the love triangle. Bella has decided her fate in choosing to become a vampire and this movie is about that transformation. The first half of the movie did seem to drag a bit. I have not read any of the books so I can't understand why there are five novels in the series and probably 5 pages of dialogue in the films! This has made it hard for me to connect with the characters when I don't know what the reasoning behind their motivations are. So, in that sense Breaking Dawn was a bit disappointing. The best scenes in the movie for me was the wedding. The actor who plays Charlie Swan is endearing. The end of the movie when Bella gives birth was probably the ensembles best performance of all the movies so far. Of all the movies in the series, my favorite would be New Moon. The part I loved about New Moon was when we first discover Jacob is a werewolf as he leaps into the air transforming right in front of Bella. I would've liked to see more scenes with Jacob and the werewolves rather than a long drawn out honeymoon. And I really didn't like the scene when Jacob leaves the pack. They could have shot that scene in human form and transformed into werewolves. It just came across as a corny scene when it should have been Jacob's moment to shine. The editing was a problem in this movie too. It may seem silly to complain about Bella walking down the aisle in heels and then dancing with Edward wearing sneakers, or the Cullen's having styrofoam cups and straws in their house, but when you're distracted by these things it takes you away from the story. These films have the same problem as Interview With A Vampire did. How do you make a credible vampire movie that has a PG-13 rating? So, I would say it's not the best or worst film in the series and is worth seeing if you really enjoy the Twilight saga."
"T-B-Heath","8","2","8","25 November 2011"," An Emotional Accumulation
","I had spent almost an entire year waiting for Breaking Dawn Part 1. Ever since viewing Eclipse I'd anticipated the next film in the series, frequently browsing google for any updates on the film, on what new information, stills had been released about it. So when the film was finally released, I was shocked at the mass negative reception it received. Only a few days later did I myself get to make my own judgement - I loved it! It's been almost a week now since having seen the film for myself - it is still with me. You know a film is great, or at least entertaining, engaging, because it sticks with you psychologically. The emotions you feel, the senses you feel whilst watching the film stay with you afterwards. This was definitely the case with Breaking Dawn Part 1.<br/><br/>The Twilight Series are not a set of perfectly made films - though I would certainly proclaim them to be worthy adaptations of the literature that preceded them (I haven't read any of Meyer's novels, save for a few extracts here and there - I still stick firmly to this opinion). None of them are perfect - there's a number of things wrong with New Moon, with Eclipse, and yes, with Breaking Dawn Part 1. However, the things that are wrong, misguided about Breaking Dawn - with any of the Twilight films for that matter - are so unimportant and outweighed by the successes of the films that they are really not worth devoting any words of this review to - at least not any more to. What I really want to do is share what I loved about Breaking Dawn in particular. First, the wedding. Brilliantly was the event captured by Condon and the crew. The build-up - Bella's moment with her parents before the ceremony, her talking with Edward the night before, her walking down the aisle with Charlie. Having watched Bella's history, her relationships with all these characters in the preceding films, especially her father, I was able to appreciate these moments Bella has, just before, during and just after the wedding. I would say that Breaking Dawn is a film which, whilst not absolutely requiring the viewer to have seen the previous film entries to enjoy it, will certainly be more, much more enjoyable and immersing for those who have grown with Bella, with her life up to this film.<br/><br/>And that is what is most great about this film - it is an emotional accumulation. For Edward and Bella, as a now married couple. For Jacob, who now finally has to let go of Bella, and come to terms with her pregnancy, and then her subsequent ill health. Kristen Stewart plays Bella with such an authority - she's earned it, having portrayed her for a number of films now. I will make this key point - the Twilight Series is about Bella, it's her story. It is her emotional accumulation that matters most - the ending is a great demonstration of this, a heart penetrating reflection on her life - her human life, all her significant moments, her happiest, saddest memories - I won't give it away, but the very last moment of her human life shown in the flashes, one that no viewer has seen, was a beautiful artistic choice.<br/><br/>All this serves the great contrast we are about to witness, the vampire Bella. All the Twilight films have great, emotionally climactic endings - Breaking Dawn Part 1 continues that tradition. Again, I won't give away what the actual ending is, but it is satisfying.<br/><br/>The film is full of emotion, its packed with it. From the wedding, to the honeymoon, to the stages of Bella's pregnancy, to the chaos of her delivery - true chaos is depicted, a true sense of urgency, of danger and panic - the performances needed were provided, by all. The confusion, doubt, angst, volatility, hatred, desperation - the film convinces us of these emotional states that the characters go through, all throughout. The moment Bella supposedly dies, it is heartbreaking, the way it is shot, the way her face is seen smiling at her baby daughter the moment it has just been delivered, just before she goes blank, and becomes completely non-responsive. This is one of the film's, the entire series, most saddening moments.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a tough film to watch at moments. It is exciting, funny, shocking, gory, immersing, and touching. I came out of the cinema excited by everything I had seen. The film was a real treat to have seen, and was most definitely worth the wait. Part 2 next. Thanks for reading - hope you enjoyed, or will enjoy, the film too!!"

","On first watch I wasn't too sure about this film, but now I've accepted that it's not supposed to be looked at as a film like many others are. It's full of beautiful shots that some fans will love, and possibly some will hate - you can't please everyone though.<br/><br/>There are moments of the film where I just want to bury my head in my hands and shout ""whhhyyy"" but like I said before - you can't please everyone and there are certainly parts of this I can't stand.<br/><br/>Still, for those who say you could have put part 2 in with this are only going to be met with a barrage of fans who would have been happy to have seen a solid 3 hours just of the honeymoon scene let alone anything else in part 1.<br/><br/>I thought that 2 of the 3 main leads of this film were at their best whilst sadly one (Taylor) wasn't really given much of a chance and whilst he should (in my eyes) have felt desperate and in love just came across as annoying and petty.<br/><br/>The best scene was the birth scene and even for a 12a it was a little gory but i'd have loved a higher classification just to see something a litter harder hitting like described in the book. There was lots that did fit the book, lots that didn't but even the book was hardly the best and not to mention having to film/edit for the younger market. Don't forget, apparently this is a film for kids not really for adults. (Even if a huge proportion of fans are indeed actually over 30, or so I've read somewhere.) I've seen this film more than two times now, for research purposes only of course, but I can honestly say when I let myself get carried away with the cheesiness of a lot of it, I actually really really liked it!"
"tmac84","7","2","8","22 November 2011"," Review From A Male Perspective
","I rated this movie as a seven and feel that it is watchable for most men. The movie starts off very slowly, with lame jokes and a less than romantic wedding scene, but what else can you expect from a film that has a largely teenaged fan base? It does manage to pick up once the story shifts locations and has a decent amount of drama that will at least keep most men awake to follow the storyline. More importantly, the story ends with a great buildup to the final movie.<br/><br/>For more on why I rated this a 7, you can see and hear my comments (which include spoilers) in the link below: http://www.spreecast.com/events/easymactwilight"
"EmmaDinkins","Null","2","8","21 November 2011"," Chix Chat on Film review: The honeymoon is over.
","I was immediately impressed by the look of this film, all the location shots were simply beautiful to behold from the wedding to the aerial view of Rio de Janeiro to Isle Esme. The special effects were so believable that I shuddered at the ferocity of the wolves and the rapidly diminishing health of Bella (Kristen Stewart), she really looked a hot mess. I had an expectation from the trailer that the film would be more action driven, but it was primarily a love story at least until the honeymoon was over with a wedding night pregnancy. At that point of course everything was all about protecting Bella, oh wait that's been the constant theme in the entire series. I have really grown tired of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) pining away for her. Dude get over it, it's never gonna happen! I know the stories correlate very closely to the books so there's nothing he can do about it, but I'm just saying. Maybe someone should show him the end of New Moon when she tells him it's Edward (Robert Pattinson), it's always been Edward, it's always gonna be Edward. The whole story with Jacob standing up to the pack was worthwhile, it showed that being in love with Bella hasn't completely emasculated him, although he pretty much did that for her too. I'm tickled each time I watch these films that Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) typically has one word dialogue, and basically just maintains that odd look of despair. I still don't understand how Charlie (Billy Burke) could live in Forks all this time and not figure out that there are Vampires and Werewolves and Bella figured it out within months of moving there. I actually did like this film, but I don't feel as if I would have missed very much had I just waited until Part Two when everything all comes together with the Volturi confrontation. I know from my family members who read all the books and are ultimately and completely infatuated with the stories that they left from seeing the movie satisfied. I left wanting more which I am sure was the whole point of breaking the final story into two parts. For anyone unfamiliar with the series and the books, this is not a must see film, because none of it would make sense if you just went to see a movie and checked this one out, but if you are familiar it was entertaining enough for me to give it an amber light."

","This was a film for fans of the series. If you are a fan, you will LOVE this film. The cinematography is without equal. Just watching the film will make you ""ooh and aah"" even if you are not crazy about the story.<br/><br/>You can understand and appreciate the actions of the characters and their motivations for those actions. It is a film with true feeling as anyone who has ever been in love will tell you.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and was quite pleasantly surprised by it. I especially loved the end scene.

","I am anything but a fan of the chick-flick,but I have been seduced by the entire twilight series. More questions than answers have been created by part 1. I believe that was the intention of the writers/directors. It left me wanting the answers and I suspect part two will break the all time top 5 movie opening night sales. Great movie I say spend the money for the big screen effect you will not be disappointed. Can't wait for the follow up. <br/><br/>I was floored by the extremely low rating but am sure it will come up dramatically as the number of reviews increases. I believe that most of the ratings reflect the feeling of being left in the dark about so many questions in the plot however the release of part two will unveil part one as a true classic in my opinion."
"lady-libre","Null","2","8","20 November 2011"," Loved, loved, loved this movie!
","Starting at the beginning, the movie omits that Edward sent Jacob a personal note along with the wedding invitation. That detail would have made the invite less like a slap in the face, I think. Maybe.<br/><br/>Beautiful wedding, from Bella's stunning dress to the toasts, which were unexpected but hilarious, Charlie's especially! I think RobPat/KStew's awkwardness at times was a brilliant choice the actors made because of the wedding's subtext: Edward loves Bella but wants her to stay human. Bella loves Edward/wants to be a vamp but fears she'll never see her family again and hates hurting Jacob. <br/><br/>The honeymoon ... my favorite part was Bella in the mirror the next morning, remembering their night. That was exquisite and sweet, and far more telling than how much furniture they destroyed. When Edward first appeared in the bedroom across from Bella, the way he looked at her was so tender. Then they met at the foot of the bed, realizing what was supposed to come next, and their nerves popped up, LOL. So realistic! <br/><br/>From Jacob's POV, I wish the beach scene had more explicitly explained imprinting, especially on little children. I liked how Condon handled the imprinting scene – watching Renesmee grow up through Jacob's eyes – but the voice-over/imagery wasn't strong enough to overcome the incorrect notion (held by some people) that we just watched a teenage boy fall in love with a baby. Either that or showing Jacob's feeble attempts to imprint on random girls he met (when he drove away in the book after Edward betrayed him) might have been helpful.<br/><br/>Jacob's emotions were quite simplified in the movie. When Edward and Bella reconcile about the baby, Jacob felt Edward betrayed him because he never believed Edward would support Bella's decision to keep the baby. But in the movie, Carlisle calls Jacob downstairs before he reacts. I don't know why Jacob's feelings were so minimized, but his angst would have added a needed layer of conflict. <br/><br/>Edward's role after Bella gets home was also reduced, and I wanted more of his anguish, beyond facial expressions and posturing. That would have explained part of Jacob's softening, perhaps.<br/><br/>More interaction between Bella & Rose and Jacob & Rose would have been great; those scenes in the book were hilarious. Edward's ""talk"" with Jacob was also sanitized, perhaps in keeping with Jacob's overall simplification. <br/><br/>Rose helping Bella bathe was a telling little scene about their relationship, and Rose closing the bathroom door in Edward's face also spoke volumes. <br/><br/>Leah, Leah, Leah ... she and Jacob uniquely understand each other's pain. ""... just to break the connection,"" great line. Seth was adorable.<br/><br/>KStew was amazing from start to finish, but especially after the honeymoon. I read BD twice, but I started wondering if she were really dead! She didn't blink, flinch, or move on that table, Wow. Edward's desperation and heartache were palpable while she was lying on that table. <br/><br/>I missed the other Cullens as they were relegated to the background based on the story. I liked watching how happy Esme and Carlisle were during the wedding. More Alice and Emmett are always welcome, and I cannot wait for him in part two.<br/><br/>The birth scene was graphic, hard-to-watch, and dead on with the gore in the novel. Bella's transformation was handled perfectly. Even though I saw the end coming – Bella opening her eyes to end the movie – I was still shocked and excited. She was stunning!<br/><br/>Aro was a wicked delight as always. <br/><br/>Flaws and all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and could watch it a third time. If you loved the books or the other movies, you will also love this. Great job, Bill - Bring on part two!!!"

"smklavergne","6","2","9","6 December 2011"," Mixed Emotions
","I jumped on the Twi-wagon much later than the rest of the world. I actually started reading the series when Eclipse was in the theaters last year. I read the book, then watched the movie for the corresponding book and since I didn't get to see Eclipse until it was on DVD, I finished up the books. All I can say is that they were amazing, and kudos to Stephanie Meyer for writing a heck of a story! I was disappointed in the movies only because I felt there were important details left out that probably would have made for great cinema. I digress - fast forwarding to this past weekend I finally forced myself to see Breaking Dawn pt. 1. I was completely obsessed with it's release initially, but after reading the reviews I waited until it had been out for a couple of weeks before seeing it. Overall, the movie wasn't bad. The last 40 minutes were really the most exciting for me, and Condon did a decent job in stirring emotions that were felt so strongly from reading the books. I'm going to see it again before it's out of theaters. One thing I did enjoy was seeing Stewart and Pattinson grow as actors.<br/><br/>I had to constantly remind myself that the movie will NEVER be as good as the book. Period. I think if you haven't read the books, the movies are acceptable, because you don't truly know what all is missing. The books evoked so many different emotions in me, and I was hoping to get that feeling back from seeing the movies.<br/><br/>I will say that Breaking Dawn has the strongest adult themes of all of the movies/books and if you look past the vampire v. human aspect, you can equate the character's lives with issues that we deal with daily.<br/><br/>Overall, I left the movie feeling satisfied but wanting more - not really for the 2nd installment (simply because I know what's going to happen) but because I felt only the surface of the very intense book was scratched. I'm hoping that the second installment will bring back those intense feelings in response to the Cullen's experiences after Bella's change and Renesmee's birth."
"jellybean_16-1","7","2","9","2 December 2011"," Misunderstood
","The Twilight Saga seems to have left people in completely confusion about films; not only genre and direction, but plot and acting talent too. Yes, I happen to be a girl just come out of her teen years, who likes fiction and occasionally likes a good love story too, but I would never stretch to say that I have been a fan of Twilight films. I read the books when I was 15 years old and, I must admit, got pretty hooked on them However, I grew up (as some girls obviously haven't) and, with the release of the first, second and third film, I became disappointed with the portrayal of something that, in my mind, was nothing but a harmless fairy-tale with a bit of back-bone to it. I was certainly disappointed and almost angered at the casting of Bella with a talentless and frankly unbelievably dull Kristen Stewart in her role.<br/><br/>Anyway, to the film. I saw Breaking Dawn the day after its release and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and, after reading these reviews, I realise that I am probably in a large minority in having any positive experience of this film. Whether it's the hype or the somewhat deserving mockery that this saga has received, I feel that a huge amount of people have failed to realise that this is the first film in the saga which has had 1) a fairly good quality of acting - mainly not on Bella's part though, 2) an actually thought-provoking and in depth plot and 3) some very impressive Directing talent. This 'harmless fairy tale' which I described it as earlier, in my eyes, had become something of a dark reality twisted around what we believe to be fiction. In no way am I saying that perhaps vampires do exist, however this film dealt with far more than vampires and seemed to have left all that jargon to the other films this time. What we dealt with this time was passionate sexual desire, the quick (and painful) maturing of an 18 year old girl with a situation which definitely fits with real life problems in this day and age and consequently moral debates as to how to deal with it. Rosalie's almost hatred for Bella becomes care and understanding at the appearance of this baby (or 'foetus' as they call it), Edward's love becomes fear of loss, and as does Jacob's friendship.<br/><br/>Although I do appreciate that they left a great deal out of the book, that's just what films do. They're appealing to a different audience than those who read books - people who read books want to know everything about the characters they're reading about, all about their lives, their thoughts, feelings, and every little detail about a wedding dress. Those film buffs out there (or those un-willing to sit and read a book) want to start where the action begins, and carry on from there. They have the visual and auditory aids to be able to work out for themselves how the character is feeling or thinking, and what is going on, so they need no fanciful metaphors, descriptions or details. Besides, I think we'd all be complaining a hell of a lot more if the film was filled with unnecessary details. <br/><br/>Over-all, I think this was the best in the saga, as it dealt with real things, with none of the stupid vampire rivalry, jealousy, or trying to find out whether everyone is actually a fictional creature or not, with a small but perfect amount of humour, still establishing in itself the ludicrousness of the subject."

"email-the-rose","10","2","9","28 November 2011"," yes, i really am giving it 10 stars!
","This review contains SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I'm probably one of the very few ppl who will give this movie 10 stars. I respect that many don't like it, but am saddened that hating on this particular series has become somewhat of a trend.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the entire Twilight series, the movies as well as the books, even though I can understand why it is considered immature and boring by some. I just think that not everything has to be taken so very seriously and some kitsch and romance can be nice once in a while. I honestly believe there are far worse movies/books out there that haven't been as brutally trashed as Twilight.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Pt 1 is, as all the Twilight movies, very well adapted from the book. One thing I'v always liked about the Twilight movies is that they keep so closely to the books, which only rarely happens. The cinematography is pretty and often dream-like which I think fits the mood of the books, especially considering Bella's strange dreams throughout the series. (I loved the dream sequence with the white dress and the blood, which I think was a nice way of introducing the darker mood of the second part of the movie.)<br/><br/>Personally, I liked the slow pace and the contrast between the beautiful wedding/idyllic honeymoon and the dramatic turn where Bella finds out she's pregnant. I know that many ppl comment that a pregnancy is not something to be depicted in such a dramatic light, but we should keep in mind here that it's not a normal pregnancy and that the emotional strain for everyone involved is great and painful. In my opinion this is shown very well by seeing Bella get worse in every shot and the general tension inside the family mirroring the tension growing in the wolf pack. Once again the somewhat slow pace represented Bella's inability to do anything and was cleverly interspersed by the action going on outside, especially with Jacob and the pack (as was the intention in the book, where we don't even see Bella most the time during her pregnancy and get to see everything through Jacob's eyes.)<br/><br/>I also liked that for the first time the telepathic link of the pack was depicted as we so often read about it in the books instead of just mentioned on the side. I think it's important to show the pressure Jacob is under, torn between his family and the love he has for Bella.<br/><br/>Moreover, I disagree that there is no valuable message or meaning in this movie. In my eyes the point is not, as so many like to mock, to practise safe sex and not get pregnant. The point isn't even the pregnancy. For me it's all about the struggle of loving something that has the potential to destroy you. It's about giving everything to your child because you want it to live and in trying to make other people understand that. It's also about Edward: he is depicted as someone who isn't ever satisfied with himself, who thinks he's a monster and therefore every part of him, including his child, must be a monster too. One of my favourite scenes is when Edward finally hears the baby and tells Bella that 'I always thought it was like me, but it's like you' where he finally accepts that there is no monster, simply a part of them both that loves them and wants to be loved.<br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to touch on the subject of imprinting that so many ppl seem to find distasteful but has always been one of my favourite things in the Twilight series, especially Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee. Maybe it's because I'm a hopeless romantic, but I think the way imprinting is explained for me is just another way of saying that wolves mate for life. I don't think that it can be compared to brainwashing and especially love the fact that Jacob himself doesn't agree with it at all until it happens to him with Renesmee. It's basically like falling in love, ppl can't choose who it happens with in real life either, after all. And I also find the concept that the bond adapts according to the needs of the ppl involved very sweet and once again not so very different from relationships in real life as they tend to change over the years as well. So I don't really understand the problem. It's not like wolves that have imprinted lose the ability to feel affection for anyone else - it's not like Jacob will suddenly love Bella any less, just differently. Also imprinting is not about being controlled and losing one's will, it's simply about caring for another person and wanting to make them happy. And considering the plot, I think Jacob imprinting on Renesmee was the perfect way of ensuring that he gets a happy ending as well while also including him in the family - i would have absolutely hated for him to be unhappy till the end.<br/><br/>To conclude, I just want to say that I enjoyed the movie a lot and am very much looking forward to the second part which I'm convinced will be even better."

I know that I'm not alone, because I sat in a theater for the midnight show in November 18th full of people who also loved it, in fact, gave it a standing O. I agree that if you're not into the series, you won't get much out of it, but for those of us who are, it covered all the bases. The way that it's raking in money worldwide, we're not alone, so chill out, if you hate it that much why did you bother and see it?

Taylor Lautner and the others were also very good.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the movie was the struggle within the wolf pack.

"jazzyjosephine","8","2","9","24 November 2011"," We definitely need a part two
","I disagree with only part one is needed. We need to see the fight scene. Having an understanding of Bella's power and why she changes in that manner is a critical part of knowing and understanding her shield from Edward, We need to see Bella as a vampire. These things are essential. Heck , we need to see ReneEsme! We need to understand how important ReneEsme is to the vampire and human world. So, although I agree with your assessment of the movie for the most part, having only one part would be a mistake. I think two movies were needed (not1 year apart-I mean, that's extreme), but two parts definitely for such an expansive book."
"myzipcodeis","8","2","9","23 November 2011"," It is what it is
","SPOILER ALERT!!! Books are meant to explain, images to illustrate. Each is understood in their own way, and often the two have only a moderate compatibility. Breaking Dawn Part 1 attempts to illustrate the book to us, and by the nature of illustration's limitations, much is changed, or just left out.<br/><br/>We don't see Jacob trying to imprint on total strangers at a Seattle park. The conversations between Jacob and Leah (and other Leah actions) about her contempt for the Cullens is illustrated in a brief scene that also covers Esme's consideration of the wolves. In the book, Bella mentions that as she and Edward are driving away from the reception, she sees Renee with an arm around Phil, at the same time holding Charlie's hand. In the movie we see Renee singing to Bella, cut to the look of anguish and nostalgia on Charlie's face. Some things confused me, like the Charlie storyline.<br/><br/>Some things are expected: Jacob shirtless; Alice in full-blown fashion frenzy mode; Carlisle's wisdom; Charlie's gruffness.<br/><br/>Some things are needed: the occasional tweaking of a scene to add drama lest the movie become a snooze fest.<br/><br/>Yes, Taylor Lautner's (Jacob) acting is uneven at times, Kristen Stewart (Bella) is as closed off as ever, and Robert Pattinson (Edward) is about as exciting as a bowl of pudding. But in the hands of director Bill Condon (Kinsey, Gods and Monsters), with supporting cast members like Billy Burke (Charlie), Ashley Greene (Alice), and Nikki Reed (Rosalie), and with writer Melissa Rosenberg obviously having a lot of respect for Stephenie Meyer's work, the movie coalesces into something worth watching.<br/><br/>For me, the special effects were not overdone. I've read and heard complaints about the ""cheeziness"" of the wolves; while I wish the CGI had been better, for those who complain I remind them of the original Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>I appreciated Condon's subtlety, the best example being the bed-breaking scene (and the view of the bedroom the morning after). It was both funny and frightening, and had it been just mere mortals together, they probably would have just said ""Oops!"" Charlie's interest in the graduation hats is not only a good lead-in to his wedding speech, but also possibly a portent.<br/><br/>It is what it is. Each person must decide for themselves. I've decided I like it, and hopefully have adequately explained why. If you've read the book, approach the movie with an open mind. Even if you haven't read the book, watch the movie carefully. Better yet, watch it twice."
"fliprarity","8","2","9","23 November 2011"," Watch if you're a twilight fan
","I went to the premiere and I've read all of the books. First off, if you've hated the movies from the beginning then you're not going to like Breaking Dawn. I must admit, even if I am a fan of the books, I also disliked the first three movies. But this movie blew me away! The acting improved with Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner is exceptional. Bill Condon directed this perfectly, and took the series to the next level. And again, for all of the ""bad"" messages people take from this move, you have to read the books! All the stuff that happens in Breaking Dawn makes a lot more sense, and you won't think you wasted two hours. So basically, Breaking Dawn is a dream come true for Twilight fans and it won't disappoint."
"TMC836","10","2","9","22 November 2011"," Not horrible, but not great. Entertaining for the right crowd.
","Bottom line is Twilight fans will love it, non-twilight fans won't. <br/><br/>With that being said, Breaking Dawn takes on more adult themes and has a whole new feeling from the previous three movies. No doubt the acting by the 3 leads has been questionable up to this point and there are still moments that will make you cringe, but overall they've gotten much more believable. Perhaps this is due to the more simple and realistic plot. A marriage, honeymoon and difficult pregnancy aren't exactly unknown concepts and they bring it to new levels for this series. Where we've been subject to long pauses and awkward drama for the last 3, there is equal parts of that mixed with some real emotion. It's refreshing to see Edward and Bella laughing and having care free fun for a change. For this latest installment they step outside their comfort zones and embrace a new world. <br/><br/>Bella reluctantly embraces marriage, Edward reluctantly embraces sex with a still human Bella, Jacob embraces his birthright as alpha, Jacob also must come to terms with his new role in Bella's life, Charlie must embrace his now adult daughter, Bella embraces her unknown unborn offspring that will certainly result in her death, and as the movie ends we're left waiting to embrace these two new characters that emerge from by far the most gory and disturbing scene of the series. <br/><br/>If you're an action fan or have no patience for romance, then the first hour will bore you. The first 1/2 hour is the wedding, the second is the honeymoon, the third is the pregnancy and the last 20 minutes is the birth, aftermath and setup for part 2. If you don't care about these characters then you won't care about the wedding, it's done to play to those who have been waiting for years to see these two exchange vows. Not everyone will identify with or understand the emotions here and therefore will only see it as drawn out talking and nothing happening. Others will find it emotional to watch a young woman say goodbye to everything she knows to marry the man of her dreams.<br/><br/>The honeymoon is refreshing in an otherwise drama filled series. Edward and Bella laugh, play and have sex. Be warned there is A LOT of making out. Once again there is an audience for this and not. Some will love it, some will be bored. The sex scene is done very classy and not obscene or raunchy at all. Yet use caution with very young children. Men might actually enjoy watching Bella for this half hour as she's more half naked than dressed. It's their reward for having to endure a shirtless Jacob for 3 movies, which btw he's only shirtless in this one for the first 5 seconds of the film then never again. A blissful honeymoon ends when Bella discovers she's pregnant, but with what is the mystery. Edward vows to get the 'thing' out of her, yet Bella like most woman has already bonded and fallen in love with her offspring. <br/><br/>The pregnancy proves to be harder than Bella thought. The Cullen's and the wolves alike are sure Bella is not carrying an adorable baby, but a demon monster. The wolves plot to kill Bella, the spawn and all who try to stop them. Jacob determined to protect Bella finally takes his role as alpha and stands with the Cullens against the pack. Although this particular scene is true to the book, it just doesn't play well on screen. It came off very laughable and embarrassing. As the fetus quickly starves Bella to death while crushing her bones, it's actually disturbing to watch. Mr. Condon did a great job with that CGI. The stress and strain between Bella and Edward could be real even with a normal couple. This again could be interesting to the person and boring to others. Like the previous movies and most movies made from books, there is a lot left out. I personally think they have done a horrible job explaining the story details and setting up this series. Unless you've read the books you won't get a lot of whats going or why. And if you missed little comments or statements in this and other movies you'll be completely lost. You never really feel how questionable the 'baby' is. And despite the dramatic music, the wolf scene is so bad it overshadows Jacob's moment. Not to mention non-readers have no clue about Jacob's 'alpha drama' as it's never been made clear in the movies. There is certainly a lot more blood in this one and one scene during pregnancy will make you cringe in disgust. <br/><br/>The birth is one of the most anticipated scenes of the series. Both for readers and not. It doesn't disappoint. Readers might miss that it's not as graphic as the book, but for a pg- 13 film it doesn't leave anything out. It's gory, bloody and disturbing. It's great. After that is when things crazy. For actions fans, they'll love the last 20 minutes, lots of blood, fighting and yelling. Readers will wonder why they changed things, but it's really not unplausiable. The ending is predictable for everybody, yet it still leaves you wanting more. Don't leave when it's over cause it's not over. <br/><br/>Overall, if you care about these characters it'll entertain you. If you don't, you'll be bored. If you love the series, you'll love the movie. It's not exactly like the book, but close enough to not disappoint too much. It's worth a shot, but if you've always been a twilight hater or bias of the series, this one will not change your mind."
"sweetsmiles24","Null","2","9","21 November 2011"," Finally nailed it!
","***May Contain Spoilers***<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn Part I has finally captured what was missing in the other films - feeling and believing the passionate love Edward and Bella have for each other. Bill Condon should have directed all of the films. Finally I felt the story line was cohesive and smooth (not choppy like New Moon, for example). The Twilight Saga readers know that the books are very cohesive, but for whatever reason, the previous films were too choppy and did not make the viewer feel passionate about the entire point - Edward and Bella's love and sealing themselves to forever with each other. <br/><br/>And let's not leave Carter Burwell out of the picture. He should have done the music in all of the films. In Twilight, through music he was able to engulf the viewer into this world of fantasy by touching piano pieces, dynamic drums, and the haunting cello / violin sounds that match the storyline perfectly. I was so happy he was back for Breaking Dawn, as the music made just as much a difference as the acting and cinematography."

","C'mon guys, after Twilight and New Moon, everyone should admit the fact that the movies are made for fans; and fans around the globe will watch it no matter how suck it is! We, fans, want to see it on big screen, our own imagination is never enough, so we want the movie to include every tiny teeny weeny details, which others might think boring.<br/><br/>OK, I don't like the first one, but am able to see that the followings were getting better, and this time, seriously, I give it a 7.5 out of 10. The director should get most of the credit because he is capable of adding elements that weren't in the book, but felt natural while watching. Kristen did an outstanding job while Rob and Taylor's acting skills are improved. (spoiler alert) I like the scene where Edward challenged Bella that they were supposed to be partners but Bella made the decision on her own, nice work ~<br/><br/>Soundtrack is fine, nevertheless, the first album is so far the best in comparison. No offense, CW's The Vampire Diaries applied better music, Twilight needs to work harder on this aspect.<br/><br/>Looking forward to seeing Part II, gosh, another year?"

","What we've all been waiting for...<br/><br/>I don't think anybody was expecting that, even the readers who knew about the blood and gore which was in the book. This movie is a definable paranormal romance, as some would say, and if you ask me, I believe there was no other way as to take what was in the book and portray it in a movie. I believe Condon did a good job (in terms of portraying the elements in the book), but I also know he's going to get so much sh*t, and kind of feel sorry for the bloke. I do wish it was more like the third movie, in my opinion that was probably one of the best movies I've seen; It had love and romance, but not too much of it. It showed all the elements in such an amazing way, using different technological film effects and the themes were just astonishing.<br/><br/>Obviously, we all know that this was not the best of the series, but just like Harry Potter, the second half will definitely make up for it. The bad thing though, we're going to have to wait another year."
"vamoids","Null","2","9","19 November 2011"," This is definitely an acceptable adaption to the book
","Excited, Yes! Satisfied, absolutely! Breaking Dawn, Part 1, is as faithful as can be to such an extensive text. The elements, grace and beauty are there; In the wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy and gory birth. We see the love that Edward and Bella share. We see the hurt that Jacob feels. We witness a life changing event in this fantasy world of vampires and werewolves. Very faithful to the emotional context of the book.<br/><br/>As I watched yesterday, I did notice a considerable amount of the Jacob, Seth and Leah missing, but I do understand that what's in writing can't always be translated to the screen, otherwise you would have a 5 hour movie, and nobody wants that. What is important is that all the essential elements were there; Werewolf telepathy, her parents and friends, a short sex scene.<br/><br/>This is a ""chick flick"" no doubt. If you are not into weddings and kissing and cuddling, this is not for you. This is a movie for ""Twi-hards"", guys that want to make their girls happy, and young women that could only wish that someone would love them like that!! I believe if you have not read the books and have just watched the previous 3 films you will get more of the same,(meaning pacing). I know some people will be disappointed with some of the missing scenes from the book, but overall, I was very happy when I left the theater. I will definitely see it again another 2 or 3 times."

","Edward (Pattinson) and Bella (Stewart) marry and deal with the consequences of a marriage between Vampire and human. The Werewolves want to kill Bella's baby because they believe it is a demon.<br/><br/>The first story in this Vampire series was, perhaps, the best. The sequels just made a lot money and didn't progress as we had anticipated. Hey, we had high hopes. Didn't happen.<br/><br/>What kept this series alive were the questions: Will Bella marry Edward, or Werewolf Jacob (Lautner)? If she marries Edward, will he turn her into a Vampire? If they have a baby what will it be: Vampire or human? If she marries Jacob, then what? And, will Bella's family ever find out what is really going on? Will we?<br/><br/>Anyone who watches this Part 1 will immediately see that the story was stretched out waiting for Part 2 when we suspect many things will happen to conclude this saga. Witness the wedding, which went on for too long and where the dialogues were stilted and slow as lines were mouthed as though the characters were rehearsing them. And, the honeymoon also went on for too long and anyone could tell Bella was not a happy camper. <br/><br/>The wedding and the honeymoon took up about half of the movie and both could be termed ""awkward."" As we watched, we kept asking: what is going on here?<br/><br/>A spark of life comes on the scene when Jacob appears and the movie picks up some. When the Werewolves make their appearance, we could see the CGI wasn't as good as in previous episodes. We were not amused.<br/><br/>This Part 1 is just a setup for Part 2 when everything will come full circle, hopefully. Also the acting performances were disappointing all around. Not good. We expected better after all this time.<br/><br/>However, the very last scene in here tells us that Part 2 will be a real EYE-OPENER. Let's hope. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, but this too was awkward and nothing is seen. Nudity: Partial. No frontal. Language: No.<br/><br/>Rating: C (5/10)"
"JimmyCollins","9","2","10","30 November 2011"," An overload of swoony, cheesy romance, but that doesn't make it not good.
","The twilight films are always going to be the easiest film franchise for people to make fun of, but honestly I don't think they are that bad, well New Moon was pretty bad, But Twilight, Eclipse and this are all rather good. People have complained that the story is split in to two parts but I think for a book as long as Breaking Dawn there's no other way it could be done.<br/><br/>Being split in two parts allows the first film to concentrate on the very melodramatic but still nice romance between Bella and Edward, the wedding and honeymoon scenes are quite lovely to watch. I'm guessing that all the action is being saved for Part 2, which is wise I think, putting it in this film would have been too much I think.<br/><br/>This is easily the darkest and most adult of the franchise, it has some truly awesome scenes, in particular the dream sequence at the beginning and the birthing scene, they are both pretty messed up. The only thing I can say is bad is the acting by most of the cast, Kristen Stewart is the only one with any type of acting ability,this may sound silly but I think if this weren't a twilight film people would be wowed by her performance, she's exceptional and the heart and soul of the film. The same can't be said about Ashley Greene though, she is a terrible actress *ahem Summers Moon ahem*, she's kinda laughable as with the rest of them.<br/><br/>The sex scene is a bit of a cop out, but we can always hope and pray for a directors cut DVD. Hooray."

","Thank you, RiffTrax. Without you, I couldn't have made it through The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1. This movie is awful, plain and simple. The acting and dialogue are terrible, as I've come to expect with this franchise, and it's an incredibly boring movie. You can practically hear the filmmakers stretching scenes out so the razor-thin plot could be spread over two movies. The only redeeming quality of Breaking Dawn - Part 1 is the visual effects that were used to make Kristen Stewart look terrible. This isn't a good movie - if you think it is, you're lying to yourself."

","I was really looking forward this movie and I thought that it was okay. But sometimes really gross and awkward, especially since I watched it with my mum. I thought the first half (before we got pregnant) was good. I liked their honeymoon bit. Then when she got pregnant I found it just a little bit awkward. Especially since I was only 11 when the movie came out. I think that the actors did a really good job especially Rob and Kristen. I hate the part where she breaks her back ad then gives birth because I really can't keeps era open during that scene as it is gross, disturbing and cringy. The fight between the wolves and the Cullens was good an i loved how some of the wolves defended them. I really hate how Jacob imprinted on Renesmee. I mean you don't love someone and then when thy get married you imprint on their daughter, that's wrong. Then when Bella was shantung into a vampire and she opened her eyes I was like no!

"joshuadrake-91275","10","1","6","23 September 2015"," I still love BREAKING DAWN - PART 1!
","--WARNING! This review contains spoilers, if you haven't seen this film, you may want to before reading this review!-- Well, I have reviewed the first three films in the five-film TWILIGHT franchise, now it's time to continue with THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN. Before you read this review, I recommend you watch the first part of BREAKING DAWN before you read this review.<br/><br/>Now, let's get started.<br/><br/>PLOT THEATRICAL VERSION The first part follows the first half of the last book nicely: It follows Bella and Edward as they get married, have their honeymoon, until they learn that Bella has became pregnant. They return back to Forks and this causes conflict between Jacob Black and Edward Cullen, but they eventually work together to protect her because the wolf pack leader Sam, is against the baby and fearing that every human will be in danger, they try to destroy it.<br/><br/>Bella soon has the baby and names it Renesmee, but she dies soon after. Jacob gets all emotional and attempts to kill the baby, but he imprints on the child instead and tells Edward that he won't kill him.<br/><br/>This leads into a big and intense fight between the Cullens, Jacob and the other werewolves, in which Jacob responds to Sam, ""Stop! It's over! If you kill her, you kill me!"".<br/><br/>Edward waits until she dies to change Bella into a vampire, in which she turns into a vampire the next day before the film ends.<br/><br/>In a post-credits scene, The Volturi and their leader Aro receives a letter from Carlisle saying that Bella and Renesmee has joined their family, in which replies, ""They have something that I want"".<br/><br/>The extended version opens a little different than it does in the original theatrical version of the film. It opens with an invitation being sent by Carlisle to Aro and the Volturi about Bella and Edward's wedding, in which he kills a girl in his crew. The rest of the film follows the plot as the original version, but with a few new things.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna say I hate ""BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE"", but I will say the theatrical version was too short, but the extended version feels like it's 124 minutes long and that's a good thing because I thought that the original version was way too short and it did not focus on the story a lot more.<br/><br/>The extended cut really does give you more story, more character development and an alternate opening that was cut out in fear of an R rating.<br/><br/>One thing that was really cool to see that me and my sister LeeAnn did not see in NEW MOON and ECLIPSE was hearing the werewolves including Leah, Seth, Sam and Jacob talk and when Sam and Jacob argue, he says ""I will not kill Bella! I AM THE GRANDSON OF EPHRAIM BLACK! I AM THE GRANDSON OF A CHEAP! I WAS NOT BORN TO FOLLOW YOU OR ANYONE ELSE!"".<br/><br/>On top of that, we get to the one thing that almost threw me off and this was the birthing scene. Eventually, the birthing scene had a lot of controversy over because this was the most graphic thing in the book and this is why a lot of fans worried that the film was going to get an R rating, instead of the PG-13 rating, but they managed to show the whole pregnancy scene in the film from Bella's point-of-view. The film did actually get it's PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.<br/><br/>Now, I get to the story. Out of all of the Twilight movies, BREAKING DAWN's two-part story is the most easiest to follow, but it is also the most emotional and darkest one in the series because the book is so dark and mature. I don't blame this story, but I think it's a very good thing to follow the story because if BREAKING DAWN was not into two parts and was released as a four to five hour long movie, me and my sister LeeAnn, who is a big Twilight and Vampire Diaries fan, would have fallen asleep because the film would have been too long, but as a movie presented in 2 parts, it is interesting and fantastic.<br/><br/>The musical score composed by Carter Burwell is emotionally powerful and memorable and the songs in the movie are really cool to listen to. The only two songs in this film that I like is ""A Thousand Years"" by Christina Perri and ""It Will Rain"" by Bruno Mars and I did saw the video. It is fantastic.<br/><br/>Like I said in the first three reviews of TWILIGHT, the main cast is really phenomenal. The only new introduction in this film was Mackenzie Foy as Renesmee, who would later play in the 2014 film directed by Christopher Nolan, INTERSTELLAR.<br/><br/>Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1 does get a little out-of-hand in some areas in the original version, the extended version gets a lot of stuff right and improves on everything from ECLIPSE and the first film.<br/><br/>THEATRICAL / EXTENDED VERSION RATINGS: Because of the short run time and some of the good parts cut out, I'm giving the original version of BREAKING DAWN - PART 1 a 3.9 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The extended cut was a lot more great in terms of story, character development, music and pacing, so I will give the extended version of BREAKING DAWN - PART 1 a perfect score of 10 out of 10 stars."
"g-bodyl","8","1","6","22 May 2013"," Possibly the Best in the Series Yet!
","I know the Twilight films have been vilified since the first film was released in 2008. These films are actually not as bad as I feared and the fourth addition, Breaking Dawn Part 1 continues that trend for me. Yes, there are some cheesy romance scenes, but as a whole the movie works for me. Also what works is how this movie happens to portray one of the best childbirth scenes ever filmed and the director, Bill Condon did a great job delivering suspenseful and emotional moments leading up to that memorable scene.<br/><br/>Bill Condon's film takes the adventure of Bella, Edward, and Jacob to the next level. The governing vampire body is growing a bit too close onto the Cullen clan and the relationship between the vampires and the wolves are growing worse thanks to the baby growing rapidly in Bella's stomach.<br/><br/>The acting is really not that bad. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are comfortable with their roles despite participating in some cheesy romance scenes and delivering some head-shaking lines. The rest of the cast works pretty well. When the first film came out, I always thought Billy Burke was the best part of the film. Three films later, I still hold that opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a darker, more brooding Twilight film. There is not much action sequences because Part 1 is simply setting up for Part 2. I actually have high hopes that Part 2 can deliver a fitting finale. I rate this film 8/10."

","The rating of 4.9. is ridiculously low and most definitely unfounded. Give me a break people! (yes I was born in the 70's). I LOVED the music, I LOVED the emotion, I LOVED the nostalgia. I was very much affected by this movie. I think it was very well done, from a regular person's point of view (who else really counts as far as the box office is concerned). The wedding made me cry (because of the music), the honeymoon locale and ambiance was unforgettable (I would do anything for a moonlit night on an exotic beach with the man of my dreams), the rest of the story and particularity the music was moving and I felt, well acted and convincing. The low IMDb ratings for the Twilight movies, despite the exorbitant profits is a little annoying. I LOVE watching them as do obviously a gazillion other people! Be sure to view this with the lights low, a glass of wine (if you are of age) and an open heart and you will be transported into the feelings of love and life and the emotion of it will be an absolutely unforgettable experience. Heartless cynics, get lost and find another place to reside, you don't belong here."

They got better and better and better. I can not wait until breaking Dawn 2 comes out 11-16-2012. Yes, I am following it that much. I was in such anticipation for the wedding that I almost could not contain myself. It was amazing how they made it work, it was all very breath taking. I think that they made the sex scene very tasteful and what it should be between two people that have waited. Then, when it came to Bella being pregnant and looking the way that she did, they did an amazing job at making her like like pure heck! When Jacob imprinted on Rennesme I cried so much.

","Out of the series so far, this one is the worst. The 3D version I am glad I did not see. By all accounts it was horribly done. My fiancée loved it and wanted more, For me it was lacking on many levels.<br/><br/>The movie starts well enough. The plot is there, but they spent far too much time on the birthing scenes and seem to draw it out just for the second part. Bloody, gory, and focused far too much attention on the pregnancy. This movie needed a lot more balance.<br/><br/>If you have a weak stomach, do not eat before seeing this movie. We were shocked to actually see people protesting this movie outside saying we were all going to hell for watching it.<br/><br/>This movie could have been excellent. If you take away most of the pregnancy and added a touch more to the rest of the movie, it would have been better.<br/><br/>This is not one I would recommend to others. It left many in the theater even on the 2 d feeling a little off kilter on the stomachs.<br/><br/>This is not one to bring small children to see. It was by far the darkest of the series and by far the weakest and bloodiest. I would struggle to recommend this for the teenage audience on the bloody pregnancy scenes. <br/><br/>We loved the first ones of the series but this one was a disappointment. I hope they learn from their mistakes in the second part.<br/><br/>Fiancée 8/10 stars me: 3 at best."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","6","31 December 2011"," Kristen Stewart's show
","To anyone paying attention to the word-of-mouth publicity, this movie's complete immersion in melodrama is all but predictable. There is the sappiest of wedding and honeymoon, pregnancy, maternity love and all the other stuff. There is also a bit of ""Rosemary's Baby"".<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart deserves all the credit, not just in the generally acknowledged maturing of her acting ability. She is no beauty in the conventional sense, but Bella does not need to look beautiful - one is enough and two may be redundant. Class and character is what becomes Stewart. The credit however goes to allowing herself to look so positively ghastly when she is being eaten alive, almost in a literal sense, by the baby inside her.<br/><br/>Very much in the same vein of Harry Potter 7.1, this Twilight 4.1 is a preparation of the grand finale. The entire two hours is about two things – the marriage and the pregnancy and childbirth. Stewart dominates as Robert Pattinson is little more than a big support. Taylor Lautner carried on winning more and more sympathy form the audience. The familiar faces and character are all there, talking and walking props. Most disappointing is the blink-and-you-miss-her appearance of Anna Kendrick.<br/><br/>After the birth of the baby girl which Jacob takes under his wings or, shall I say, claws, the one last bit of drama and tension remaining is the fate of Bella. This is handled quite cleverly. After a long struggle on the brink of death (longer than many in the audience might expect) Bella is shown in a close-up of her face which had been expressionless in a good last 15 minutes (not continuously, thank heavens). In the very last shot, we see Bella's eye, finally, open abruptly – and the iris is red. See you in November 2012..if the world is still around."
"Faizel-R","5","1","6","2 December 2011"," Fairly average adaptation
","This movie will appeal to die hard fans of the series. It is a reasonable adaption of the first part of the book. The graphical presentation is impressive. You do get a sense for the environment and breathtaking locations. However the acting is weak all-round. None of key moments are portrayed with any sense of conviction and this leads to an average presentation. The story telling is also a weak point, since film fails to convey the inner turmoil experienced by the main protagonists.<br/><br/>Considering the target audience, I think this movie will perform reasonably well at the box-office in anticipation of the finale'."

","This is actually my least favorite movie out of the twilight films, and I love these books and films. I'm really sad and disappointed. They split the final book into two movies so they had more time to develop the storylineat least that's what I thought (aside from making more money), and this is what they end up with? This movie rubbed me the wrong way from the first few minutes with the dream sequence. The true dream was about immortal children. It's the whole foundation of the entire book and to change it to newborn fears was wrong. The wedding was drawn out too long, I was actually boredand those stupid toast just added insult to injury. Then the honeymoonKristen's acting was completely one dimensional, it was like trying to watch some who's overly Botox friendly make a facial expression. She's great w/pain and stress, but we already knew that from her diabetic scene in Panic Room. They excluded one of the best dichotomies, which is the combative relationship between Rosalie and Jacob; it's great and funny. They underdeveloped Seth's (and Leah's) presences, Edwards agony, and the draw between Jacob and Reneesme in the womb. The director took too many liberties with creative interpretation. The only saving grace is the amazing special effects with Bella's pregnancy, the birth, and the transformation!!!"
"RichardGeres","Null","1","6","20 November 2011"," Part I
","I found several scenes worthwhile after all. The problem with TWILIGHT is the basic premise: Girl is torn between a vampire and a werewolf. Filmmakers have trod this familiar path before, most popularly with the Kate Beckinsale-starred, UNDERWORLD, as well as on cable TV's THE VAMPIRE DIARIES. And a cornucopia of wannabe authors have cropped up after Stephenie Meyer's meteoric rise and TWILIGHT's phenomenal success. In the hands of Catherine Hardwicke, the first two films delved deep into Bella Swann's musings and quandaries, while bombarding us with innumerable scenes straight out of a Vogue pictorial with beauteous vampires dressed to the nines and pouting angstily. This third film (broken into two parts, bringing in more dollars for the people involved) is handily directed by Bill Condon, who gave us the wonderfully crafted GODS AND MONSTERS."

","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1, reviewed by our 13-year-old critic, Daniel Menegaz is the first half of the final installment of the Twilight saga movies based on the novel by Stephanie Meyer that has gripped the nation since Twilight first came out on print. Here are Daniel's comments: It is about the tortured love story between Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) the vampire. In this first part, Bella gets married, and then gets pregnant on her honeymoon. Having read Breaking Dawn, I thought it was fairly accurate to the story. Although, the book doesn't have quite enough information to stretch into two movies, I found the movie a little boring. The movie has some heavy drama; in fact, that is something I didn't like. All the characters seemed to be depressed at what should have been a happy moment. Other than that, the movie was fairly good. I really enjoyed the soundtrack and particularly the scenes. The movie has some very stunning nature shots. I think this movie is for ages 13 and up because of very inappropriate subject matter regarding the sex and Bella's pregnancy. Overall, I would give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars. If you are looking for a movie filled with drama, vampires, and werewolves, this is your movie.

","--WARNING! This review contains spoilers, if you haven't seen this film, you may want to before reading this review!--<br/><br/>Well, I have reviewed the first three films in the five-film TWILIGHT franchise, now it's time to continue with THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN. Before you read this review, I recommend you watch the first part of BREAKING DAWN before you read this review. <br/><br/>Now, let's get started.<br/><br/>PLOT<br/><br/>THEATRICAL VERSION<br/><br/>The first part follows the first half of the last book nicely: It follows Bella and Edward as they get married, have their honeymoon, until they learn that Bella has became pregnant. They return back to Forks and this causes conflict between Jacob Black and Edward Cullen, but they eventually work together to protect her because the wolf pack leader Sam, is against the baby and fearing that every human will be in danger, they try to destroy it.<br/><br/>Bella soon has the baby and names it Renesmee, but she dies soon after. Jacob gets all emotional and attempts to kill the baby, but he imprints on the child instead and tells Edward that he won't kill him. <br/><br/>This leads into a big and intense fight between the Cullens, Jacob and the other werewolves, in which Jacob responds to Sam, ""Stop! It's over! If you kill her, you kill me!"". <br/><br/>Edward waits until she dies to change Bella into a vampire, in which she turns into a vampire the next day before the film ends.<br/><br/>In a post-credits scene, The Volturi and their leader Aro receives a letter from Carlisle saying that Bella and Renesmee has joined their family, in which replies, ""They have something that I want"". <br/><br/>The extended version opens a little different than it does in the original theatrical version of the film. It opens with an invitation being sent by Carlisle to Aro and the Volturi about Bella and Edward's wedding, in which he kills a girl in his crew. The rest of the film follows the plot as the original version, but with a few new things.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna say I hate ""BREAKING DAWN - PART ONE"", but I will say the theatrical version was too short, but the extended version feels like it's 124 minutes long and that's a good thing because I thought that the original version was way too short and it did not focus on the story a lot more.<br/><br/>The extended cut really does give you more story, more character development and an alternate opening that was cut out in fear of an R rating.<br/><br/>One thing that was really cool to see that me and my sister LeeAnn did not see in NEW MOON and ECLIPSE was hearing the werewolves including Leah, Seth, Sam and Jacob talk and when Sam and Jacob argue, he says ""I will not kill Bella! I AM THE GRANDSON OF EPHRAIM BLACK! I AM THE GRANDSON OF A CHEAP! I WAS NOT BORN TO FOLLOW YOU OR ANYONE ELSE!"". <br/><br/>On top of that, we get to the one thing that almost threw me off and this was the birthing scene. Eventually, the birthing scene had a lot of controversy over because this was the most graphic thing in the book and this is why a lot of fans worried that the film was going to get an R rating, instead of the PG-13 rating, but they managed to show the whole pregnancy scene in the film from Bella's point-of-view. The film did actually get it's PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.<br/><br/>Now, I get to the story. Out of all of the Twilight movies, BREAKING DAWN's two-part story is the most easiest to follow, but it is also the most emotional and darkest one in the series because the book is so dark and mature. I don't blame this story, but I think it's a very good thing to follow the story because if BREAKING DAWN was not into two parts and was released as a four to five hour long movie, me and my sister LeeAnn, who is a big Twilight and Vampire Diaries fan, would have fallen asleep because the film would have been too long, but as a movie presented in 2 parts, it is interesting and fantastic. <br/><br/>The musical score composed by Carter Burwell is emotionally powerful and memorable and the songs in the movie are really cool to listen to. The only two songs in this film that I like is ""A Thousand Years"" by Christina Perri and ""It Will Rain"" by Bruno Mars and I did saw the video. It is fantastic.<br/><br/>Like I said in the first three reviews of TWILIGHT, the main cast is really phenomenal. The only new introduction in this film was Mackenzie Foy as Renesmee, who would later play in the 2014 film directed by Christopher Nolan, INTERSTELLAR.<br/><br/>Overall, THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN - PART 1 does get a little out-of-hand in some areas in the original version, the extended version gets a lot of stuff right and improves on everything from ECLIPSE and the first film.<br/><br/>THEATRICAL / EXTENDED VERSION RATINGS:<br/><br/>Because of the short run time and some of the good parts cut out, I'm giving the original version of BREAKING DAWN - PART 1 a 3.9 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The extended cut was a lot more great in terms of story, character development, music and pacing, so I will give the extended version of BREAKING DAWN - PART 1 a perfect score of 10 out of 10 stars."

","I loved the Twilight movies, and I hope that there will be more sequels to come, especially with original cast members. The settings where filmed were beautiful, the music captured my heart.<br/><br/>It has been a very heartfelt series and I pray that the series will go on and certain cast will let go of past and forgive you all did a wonderful job with the movies and it was nice to see a family really stand by one another. I have watched the series several times now and have bought all the DVD's and am planning on getting the whole complete set . I so felt drawn in by the main characters of the series and if more are made I pray that they all will return, we only live once and need to be able to forgive and caring to all ..

","this was a wonderful movie, for us who are twilight fans, we waited for breaking dawn part 1, and wow it was worth the wait. we are looking forward to breaking dawn part 2. so let us twilight/hard fans enjoy,keep your negative opinions to yourself. the movie was very watchable, and i would watch it again as a lot others have. if there's a six film production, (hoping with the same cast and crew), we will wait for it also- hope it would be about (leah) she needs to be happy, either way, we are sure whatever they decide to do in the future the story lines only would be better and better. as long as our happy Cullen family couples remains together, love the closeness of the that family. whatever they decide to do we are sure it will be excellent to us twilight fans. so Stephanie Meyers please keep up the good explosive work-thanks for the cast and crew, they are the best combination. i have purchased all the books, movies, and soundtracks all outstanding. waiting patiently for more. Edward and Bella with baby and so much love between them and the entire family, just breathtaking. thanks"

","Okay, I have to let you know I have a wife and three daughters, which is why I am even aware The Twilight Saga exists. To my chagrin, I have seen all the movies, and on a scale of one to ten, I give them a six at the most. These are not the vampires and werewolves we grew up with, but the Gothic romance style of the stories appears to be appealing to many people, or else why make the movies in the first place. The special effects are probably the most appealing aspect of the film. The transformation of the tribal members to wolves is interesting and very smooth. The scenery is beautiful, and the photography is exceptional. As to the acting, well, I doubt if anyone at the academy is looking to give any Oscars away, but the actors are sufficient in a melodramatic way. I personally thought I was watching a soap opera, and not feature length film. All that being said, I think, much like the Harry Potter series, the purpose of extending this final film in the series to two episodes is more financial than artistic, and the action suffers for it. Little more than a wedding, a honeymoon, a pregnancy, and  well, that would be telling. Rated PG-13, so the little ones will best be in bed, but the teenage girls will eat it up."
"lalitdevraj","5","1","7","9 February 2012"," Not a Twilight fan, but I didn't hate it.
","As I am not an aficionado of this series, I feel there would be lesser bias in terms of judging this movie. I feel that this movie was rather interesting due to the twist and turns expressed in decent fashion on screen. The effects were above par, and make up for particular scenes above expectations. Screenplay was fine and the casting has pretty much remained stable due to the same characters being portrayed within a series.<br/><br/>The beginning was ridiculous. No offense Twilight fans but indeed the initial 30 minute wedding scene + sex scene did not need to be so extended in detail, bland chatter, and overall boredom. The reason this cinema still achieves a 5 out of 10 is because the action sequences and flow were good such that by the end, with the build up and all, it felt as if I wanted to watch the second half as opposed to merely blowing off the idea of watching it. The casting since it is fixed and cannot be altered is a point to bear with as honestly two of the leads do not appear to fit the character profile other than the physical rendition. Taylor Lautner is an actor who, physically, achieved success for the role and as per the acting part, he is better than the other two, but unfortunately does not have much screen time, comparatively.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie did not strike me as one that is a must to be watched, but yes, the Twilight fans out there would not bypass this opportunity hence it is almost redundant to say this as most either hate/like/don't care/are too old to consider watching this movie."
"jjnoahjames","8","1","7","26 November 2011"," Light the candles!!!!!!!!!! Time to make love !!!!!!!
","Synopsis; Wedding stuff, baby stuff. Jake get's mad. Basic love tri. <br/><br/>The Good; Great movie length. Fresh soundtrack. Teaches morals.<br/><br/>Neutral; The acting is neither bad nor good. <br/><br/>The Bad; No Volturi. Horrible CGI scene. One scene skips over some important info, and was rusdhed(left me confused).<br/><br/>Opinion; 100% made for females. Wedding, Baby, Love Triangle = Perfect Formula. The action scenes, and moral reasoning for fights are left out here. Like a Lifetime Channel movie, despite one or two really great scenes. A really watered down Darren Alonofsky film. A Mormon undertone disturbed me on a religious level and on a basic level. Not sure if it was intentional or not. <br/><br/>Funny; The dialog really bothered me because Jacobs tribe uses a word ""imprint"" which makes me think of having sex or peeing on a tree every time it's used. <br/><br/>Expectations; For the 3rd installment of a huge franchise I thought this would be a little bit more epic, but I can see why they split it in to two parts. They kind of made a cool little story out of this one, but not epic at all. Overall this was a decent film."
"khfan250","3","1","7","23 November 2011"," We're halfway there...
","The Twilight movies are the opposing force to good movies, but with every new release, they've been getting better and better. This one is probably the best of the Saga, but does that make it a good movie?<br/><br/>The story is just as romanticized as the other movies, but what was a good change of pace was is that this one is dark. I know that the other movies had well shot, Gothic cinematography, but the silliness constantly got in the way of making them epic. This movie takes itself seriously. Much like the Planet of the Apes or The Exorcist movies, if you can buy the absurdity, they are good movies. This installment is grisly, bloody, and is the first of these movies that seems more like a fantasy as opposed to a romance.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie has improved, but none of them are good. Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson are still emotionless, boring characters who constantly have me wondering why they house the affecting of so many teenage girls. But, to Kristen Stewart's credit, this is the first movie where she actually seems to care. She's finally acting! She's finally showing real, authentic human emotion (how ironic, because, at the end of the movie, she becomes a vampire)! The rest of the cast is slow, empty, and boring. That's pretty bad when Kristen Stewart is the best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>The CGI is pure crap, simple as that. There is no thought or passion put into it. I guess the idea was that the filmmakers cared more about the story than the special effects in order to please it's intended audience of teenage girls. Here's a little hint for the filmmakers of these movies: you are a movie first, and a worldwide phenomenon second. Focus on making the film work before you take your fans advice into account.<br/><br/>One more thing before I give this movie a final verdict. A lot of people are saying that this movie has a pro-life theme and is in fact ENCOURAGING abortions. I've seen several reviewers saying stuff like, ""How dare they influence the choices of teenagers like that!"" or ""Twilight isn't talented enough to make such a statement!"" Here's the reality of the situation, internet trolls: IT'S FRIGGIN' TWILIGHT. They are dumb movies made for the sole purpose of pleasing their fan base. It isn't some elaborate scheme to recommend abortions. It is pure, stupid entertainment.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I'll admit that I have read the books and, even though they aren't masterpieces of literature, they kept my interest. If you're a Twi-Hard, you'll probably like this movie, though, as I said before, the ending is very gritty and could upset some viewers. If you hate the Twilight Saga, this brings nothing new to the table and you probably won't like it."
"stutterjunkie","Null","1","7","20 November 2011"," Now this is what they call the beginning of the end
","Okay. This fourth movie of the Twilight Saga has totally been underrated. The movie will exceed most, if not all, people's expectation. It exceeded mine and I'm not at all a fan of this movie series. I watched it because it's my job to watch movies. The first three series are not that bad but they are all as frustrating as the other and one thing's for sure about that, it's because of the power the movie holds - romance, thrill, pain, the impossibles - everything about it makes you want to watch it more during the actual showing. You may judge it beforehand, you may despise it after but you'll surely shut your prejudicial mouth during the show because Twilight Saga is simply stunning!"

Then on June 30, 2010, that same vampire – Victoria, created an army to wipe the Cullen clan off the face of the earth and the supernatural world, but in the end death would meet her in the afterlife as she herself becomes ash and dust.

","Yes! 10 out 10 because I SO love everything about this movie. I'm not sure why the overall rating here in IMDb is so low but for all Twilight fanatics like me, this is so far the best flick in the Twilight Movie Series.<br/><br/>All the ignorant critics can say what ever crap they want to throw, but they can't take away how Twilight has been absorbed and has been interpreted by its millions of fans worldwide.<br/><br/>This is not just about a teenager wanting to marry the guy she wants but this is all about the colliding of two different worlds - that of a HUMAN and that of a VAMPIRE (plus there's a werewolf too).<br/><br/>Twilight is a very entertaining story that doesn't only appeal to teenagers but to middle-aged people as well. Twilight is like a porn, an obsession, a fantasy that is overwhelming - the very reason why there are a lots of people who go GAGA over it.<br/><br/>Breaking Dawn is the last book of the Twilight Series and it sure has all the elements that make all the characters more lovable - so adorable.<br/><br/>For all Twilight fans out there who haven't watched Breaking Dawn Part 1 yet, then you SHOULD watch it. <br/><br/>Can't wait for part 2.

","I normally don't care for Twilight, but since I've been watching them all since they came out, I HAD to watch this one as well. I can say that this movie is almost flawless. This was by far not only my favorite Twilight film, but I can honestly say this is on my Top 10 already. From the beginning the flawless love and the wedding and the beauty in it all. It was SO believable, the acting, the visually stunning. I am very impressed. It had my heart and gut wrenching all the way until the end credits. The music was perfect with this film too.

"smokescreen79","10","1","8","2 February 2012"," Haters gonna hate
","Now now. Before you assume the position to actually be for or against, I'm just going to humbly share what began with thinking of the twilight saga something for retarded teenagers, induced by hormonal spiking before a regression of awkwardness would subside by age and matured tastes would flourish. But soon I found myself watching, which by many critics hating as the worst one, as the most intriguing one . After all. It is what I sincerely felt was a really good movie! Something which I hadn't had the fortune to have seen for a while. For some reason many are hellbent on hating this movie for reasons that are either beyond my ability to register, and despite that I am regarded as a bright individual. The acting, even how critical I could muster myself to be, moves forward without any reflections due to annoyances, expect for the scene where the wolfs voices felt embarrassing. <br/><br/>Im disappointed that IMDb has shown to be prone to people who intellectualize their inability to asses emotional depth. Some critic amused me with calling this a misogynistic movie, for an example. How in hell could anyon think of Bellas relationship with Edward and Jacob in any way sexist ? That is just quasi-intellectually absurd.<br/><br/>I was led to think of the twilight series as nothing else than a waste of my time, before I even had seen it. Breaking dawn a couple of months away from premier, I was encouraged to see the previous movies, and I have to say that the series dwells in more realistic action of the everyday life and the assertiveness that conflicts would arise, is in breaking dawn much more down to earth than in the previous movies.<br/><br/>What Meyers has done with the twilight saga, has led me to think that she certainly had had to come up with the story with a psychological mindset that ensued the development of her fictional characters, which deal with the uncertainties and fears of love and nature. I at least find the thought of grim death no way near as terrifying as the thought that I myself could be responsible for, as well the worries that arise from what can happen due to the love between couples turns more complicated when the love between to people prematurely in mind and spirit goes from simpe to complicated. For no mere thought of optimism, can be overshadowed by the realistic thinking of the prelude of love can onset a myriad of troubles that can't be undone, is very responsible and one of lives hardest facts to be deat with. There are very mature thoughts embedded in the story that grasp the neurotic fears of inexperience and uncertainty that I can relate to.<br/><br/>The acting is good because there are no exaggerated feelings that are tried to be conveyed by facial expressions, tone, tempo, gestures or mannerism that could arouse any awareness if you are not nitpicking. Than you would find faults in your own doctrine of narrowness. Being any more of an actor in this movie, I think had led it to have felt overly reactive and made the characters embarrassing . Its just there to the degree that the viewer has to actually put themselves in the characters position. There is no need for more, but saying that was its intent, is going to far. It works and its power lies far from being impotent. Its the viewer who has to put themselves in their position. So there is no reason, as far as I personally can tell, to argue that the acting is unsatisfactory. If it had been, the shared experience had to have been much more consistently plaque-ing the viewer. It just doesn't to appeal to some intellectually satisfactory. Which there is little grounds for. I enjoyed it."
"dlwooden","10","1","8","1 February 2012"," Best Twilight Yet
","For someone who has read the books, I am more critical than most people and I believe it was the best one yet. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 is almost completely based off the book. I loved it. The actors have really advanced in their acting since the very first one and a lot since the previous one, The Twilight Saga Eclipse. Especially, Kristin Stewart. She has had a lot of trouble showing emotions in the other movies, but in Breaking Dawn Part 1 she has really expanded her talents and made Bella a very round character. I couldn't have been more pleased with the movie. Only one cuss word and no nudity, but there is definitely innuendo."

","I really had bad hopes ,going into watching this movie. when I watched Eclipse , I promised myself Never again. But under new circumstance, had to watch this. So lets get to the point. I really don't understand why everyone is saying that this was worse part out of the series. Eclipse was much much worse.<br/><br/>The starting is slow , as usual. they spend too much time on the wedding and honeymoon , which makes sense because the book is split into 2 parts , therefore there is not much materiel to work with. This was the biggest mistake. Producers decided they wanted to make more money and risked screwing the movie which they almost accomplished.<br/><br/>another thing was the acting , awful and cliché as ever. Kristen Stewart seems to have only one expression and looks like she is in pain all the time.<br/><br/>BUT one thing that saved it or me was the pregnancy period which really worked well , and they were able to show Bella changing and dying to a fantastic level.<br/><br/>also the bloody birth scene , which lots of people say that it was similar to the scene in pulp fiction.<br/><br/>and the last weak point was the time between Bella ""dying"" and then coming back as a vampire which was way to long and stretched. just to fill up the minutes."

"pricedominic","6","1","9","6 December 2011"," The best so far? Well, thats not hard!
","I am a person who will go into any film with an open mind, wide eyed and eager in anticipation. When most blokes here about Twilight films, they automatically have the typical bloke response 'I'm not watching that rubbish, too girlie for me.' When i heard about the original Twilight film, i ignored the sceptics, and also ignored the crazy obsessed people who love every movement of R-Patz or Taylor, and i judged it as just another film.<br/><br/>The first film was pretty decent. Not a lot happened, but the characters were intriguing, and although Kirsten Stewart was insanely annoying as Bella, it was a watchable film. The series in my opinion has kind of tailed off ever since, with not enough description of what is going on, and not enough action to make it a film worthy of my very demanding viewing time. But, i have persevered, and when someone asked me if i wanted to go see Breaking Dawn part 1, i was interested to see how it ended, or at least how it began to end.<br/><br/>I have not read any of the books, i am not a big reader. I am all about the cinematic medium. Like most films that have been copied from books, the story usually does not fit in to a 90-120 minute time frame that it needs to do be a successful film. There are parts in the 2nd and 3rd film, as with this one, where peoples actions aren't really explained to you fully. You only realise it after someone who has read the books tells you the missing parts of the story. But back to this film, i thought it was a step up from the previous two. Although quite jumpy in places, leaping from one plot point to the next far too quickly, i think it had more of a kick to it than others. The scene where she collapses, and the pregnancy scenes are quite gruesome, and stick in the mind vividly. The make up team did a terrific job making her look ill, to the point where it was actually quite disgusting to even look at her (maybe that was just her though, and the make up team didn't do anything! - a joke for all those K-Stew hating girls filled with jealousy.) K-Stew has also found her acting talent in this film.... playing dead. I have never been so convinced that someone is dead, terrific performance of being dead.<br/><br/>All jokes aside, if you have seen any of the twilight films or read the books (as everyone in the world seems to have done) then you know what to expect. Lots of tension, moody looks, Vampire and Werewolf fun, and Jacob taking his top off. I am quite surprised at the low rating that this film is receiving here on IMDb, as this film has all the same elements it always has had. In my opinion, some of the scenes are much more memorable, and the acting seems to be getting better with each film that goes by. Maybe Twilight fans are finally starting to realise that it always was a pretty average film, and are expecting too much from its sequels. Either way, i would recommend watching this film, whether you are male or female, or whether you are vampire or werewolf!"

I was excited to see Breaking Dawn Part One because I knew it was going to be very difficult for Condon to portray the sex scene and the birth. I gave it a 5 because I thought it was a solid effort. The beginning was spectacular - exactly like the book with great scenery and music as well. Even the sex scene wasn't spoiled for older viewers with a PG rating. It all went downhill when they tried to demonstrate how the wolves can talk to one another - this was by far the cheesiest part of the entire movie. I winced the entire time it was so bad. They could have got the same message across without the over-amplified booming wolfy voices. The scene with the birth - I knew it was going to be incredibly difficult, but the way they chose to do it was not effective. I know it doesn't sound pretty in the book, but the shots were very choppy and confusing for anyone who hadn't read the books, and Edward had blood on his face the entire time. I swear the rest of the movie he walks around with blood dried around his mouth. Maybe I was the only one bothered by this... who knows. It was a solid effort and I knew this one was going to be the most difficult. I appreciate Condon's dedication to the book, but some things are better left on paper."

","The Twilight Saga film adaptations have all previously left something to be desired and it was for this reason that I initially didn't want to go and be disappointed with Breaking Dawn. However, after going and seeing it, I was thoroughly surprised by the movie.<br/><br/>Let me first say that while I am a fan of the Twilight Saga books I have, up until now, not been a very large fan of the movies. Breaking Dawn Part 1 has served to alter this slightly.<br/><br/>Of the two hours that I sat in the cinema, I was only annoyed three times by deviations from the book. I won't list these (they'd spoil things), but as far as book-to-film adaptations go, making only three proper – but not unnecessary – changes is quite a feat.<br/><br/>The splitting of the book into two films was, in my opinion, an excellent idea. It made it possible to have all of the details in the movie, all of the plot points and little nuances that help to fully develop a story. The movie could have been shortened though, as it began to drag a little bit in places.<br/><br/>As far as the acting went, I was also pleasantly surprised. Kristen Stewart is not known for her large range of emotions, but I was glad to see a few smiles, laughter, fear, surprise, anger and even adoration. Her acting has stepped up a notch (perhaps not a very big one though) and the rest of the cast were just as commendable, if not more so.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good; there were some beautiful island scenes, a sun over the mountains, a beautiful wedding scene – in fact, there was only one instance when the camera work annoyed me, when it constantly shifted between two faces during a conversation, quickly becoming repetitive and a little dizzying.<br/><br/>The music was well chosen too, and I particularly liked the use of Bella's Lullaby by Carter Burwell in one of the final scenes of the movie. I never felt like the music was taking anything away from the scene, or that it was overdone.<br/><br/>Overall, I give the movie an 8 out of 10 because as far as Young Adult book adaptations go, this one was the best I've seen so far; the acting was better than I expected it to be, the ending was perfect, the camera work was well-done, the music was endearing and I left the cinema wishing that I could turn right around and watch it again. However, it could have been shorter or faster-paced, and looking neutrally, certain scenes were slightly awkward, long-winded or unnecessary.<br/><br/>As a semi-Twilight fan I liked the movie, but I have to add that unless you go into the cinema looking for the good, you won't find anything to like about Breaking Dawn Part 1."

","Superior sequels develop the plot of their predecessors rather than simply imitate them. ""Gods and Monsters"" director Bill Condon and ""Twilight"" scenarist Melissa Rosenberg have taken producer Stephenie Meyer's fourth novel ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn"" and raised the stakes as well as the rivalry. The rivalry here is not confined to just Edward and Jacob, but rather Jacob and his tribe. Mind you, if you've read the novels, you're in better shape to understand the storyline. Anybody walking into ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part One,"" however, may find themselves overwhelmed by a surplus of plot which is only comprehensible if they've seen the previous three outings. This holds true particularly for people who find vampire movies irresistible. Ostensibly, Meyers has rewritten the rules that govern conventional vampire conduct to the point that the ""Twilight"" movies emerge as vampire epics in name only. In ""Breaking Dawn, Part One,"" vampires swim in streams as well as oceans. They can procreate like humans and sire offspring. They can cavort about in the daylight without any deleterious effects to their dermatology. They can admire their immortal beauty in a mirror. They even keep a cross in their house! Although their mortal enemies the werewolves can shape-shift from Native Americans to wolves, Meyer's vampires cannot convert themselves into either bats or wolves like Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula and his kind. Meyer's vampires can read minds, foresee the future, and race hither and yon in a flash, but they remain pretty much grounded. At one point in ""Breaking Dawn,"" the vampires must run a gauntlet of werewolves so that they can feed, and the fleet-footed wolves make it nip and tuck the whole way. You'd think Edward and the Cullen clan would scale the trees and hurdle from one to the next, but then the werewolves wouldn't pose much of a problem? All nitpicking aside, ""Breaking Dawn"" is just as entertaining as ""Twilight,"" ""New Moon,"" and ""Eclipse."" Indeed, the characters continue to grow. Personally, I still prefer ""Eclipse,"" because the villainous Victoria finally bit the dust. Mind you, ""Breaking Dawn"" is still splendid stuff with surprises galore for anybody who has enjoyed the franchise.<br/><br/>""Breaking Dawn, Part One"" is just what ""Twilight"" fans have been dying for from the start. Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson of ""Water for Elephants"") and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart of ""Adventureland"") finally tie the knot. They exchange vows in the woods surrounded by their friends and family. Unlike some franchises which whittle down the number of characters reprising their roles, the ""Twilight"" sagas keep bringing the principals as well as the peripherals back. Unfortunately, the lesser Cullens, who had scenes in ""Eclipse,"" merge with the background. The same is true for Bella's high school peers who are around for a glimpse or two. Happily, the character of Jane who is a member of the Volturi, played by the obnoxious Dakota Fanning, is AWOL in this entry. Sadly, she will be back in the finale. The action unfolds with an angry and obviously jealous Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner of ""Abduction"") charging off into the wilderness to change into a werewolf when he receives his wedding invitation. Remember, the werewolves here look like overgrown wolves, not the genuinely nasty critters in the ""Underworld"" franchise. Meanwhile, Bella struggles to maintain her equilibrium in high heels as Alice (Ashley Greene of ""Skateland"") chides her about getting enough beauty sleep. No sooner have they wed than our couple caper off to Brazil and then take a boat ride to a gorgeous private island paradise to be all to themselves. Talk about wish fulfillment! Edward's fangs are so pointy by this time that he literally tears the bed apart on their wedding night. Afterward, they play a lot of chess until Bella gets the hang of it and defeats him. Sure, Edward isn't proud of himself. Bella bears the bruises of his love tussling, but she isn't complaining. While Edward is away on the mainland assuaging his appetite for animal blood, our heroine finds it difficult to keep down her chicken. Oh, no, not morning sickness! This improbable turn of events surprises even Edward. Bella gets sick and Edward flies back Bella back to Forks so Dr. Carlisle Cullen (Peter Facinelli of ""Can't Hardly Wait"") can come up with a solution. As it turns out, Carlisle has no solution, and the fetus grows at such an alarming pace that it drains the life out of Bella.<br/><br/>Clocking in at 117 minutes, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part One"" spends the first hour getting the action underway with the wedding and then the comic honeymoon antics before director Bill Condon and scribe Melissa Rosenberg take things to the dark side. The special effects that shrink poor Bella until she resembles a Nazi death camp inmate are groundbreaking. Nothing about the way that she deteriorates looks spurious. Since the ""Twilight"" saga is rated PG-13, the honeymoon and the battle with the werewolves isn't as horrific as it might have been as an R-rated opus. The werewolves look a little more believable, and they even get to drool saliva. Keep in mind, the ""Twilight"" franchise is a romantic fantasy so gravity rarely interferes with these shenanigans. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart still qualify as a sympathetic Romeo and Juliet couple, but the real surprise of ""Breaking Dawn"" is Taylor Lautner who brings more gravitas to his role than in previous ""Twilights"" or the abysmal ""Abduction"" that he starred in earlier this year. Of course, Jacob came to Bella's aid in ""Eclipse"" when he wasn't competing with Edward for her affection. Jacob's character assumes greater significance in ""Breaking Dawn."" The fourth entry in the ""Twilight"" franchise packs a wallop, particularly near the end. True ""Twilight"" fans shouldn't bolt when the end credits roll because more comes after the end credits with the evil Volturi savoring the final moments."

"filipemanuelneto","4","0","1","26 March 2020"," The sweetest movie in the saga.
","This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to), but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic, something didn't work. Despite this, this film was, like its predecessors, a box office champion, teenagers consumed it well and the studio rubbed its hands with satisfaction.<br/><br/>The plot boils down to this: after defeating Victoria and her army, Edward and Bella decide to get married, much to Jacob's sadness. But something goes wrong on the honeymoon in Brazil and Bella reveals symptoms of pregnancy, which makes no sense since vampires shouldn't be able to have children. The speed of development of the fetus and the aggressive way it is sucking the energies and nutrients from Bella's body makes everyone fear for her life, and for the nature of the being she carries.<br/><br/>The new director is Bill Condon, who to me is a stranger. Unlike its direct predecessor, it replaces the action and the fight scenes with a certain cinematic sense and a growing tension that helps to mitigate the excessive sweetness of the story and make the film tolerable. In fact, I think this is the most sweet and sugary film in the saga, which was a negative point. The action reaches its climax in the delivery scene, one of the best in the saga, and the ending was very well achieved. The pace of the film is also much more balanced than its direct predecessor, although it is still slow.<br/><br/>Despite everything, the film still has problems inherited from previous films. Each film accentuates the feeling that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were casting errors. With a few exceptions (the wedding scene, the sex scene, the birth scene) there is almost no chemistry between them. There is, in fact, a general improvement in their performance, but Stewart still has to work on her lack of facial expression. Pattinson has also improved a lot and helped to give strength and passion to Edward and Bella's romance (finally!). Taylor Lautner, who started the saga well and grew, eclipses itself throughout this film, perhaps the result of the loss of relevance of his character. The actor is not to blame, he proved to be better than he is here, but he cannot do better when the material given to him by the screenwriter sucks, and that was a constant problem in the saga films. If there was anyone who, throughout the entire saga, signed a certificate of incompetence and imbecility, it was Melissa Rosenberg. The secondary cast maintains the positive level of previous films. Billy Burke and Ashley Greene are very good, as are Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Nikki Reed, Maggie Grace and Booboo Stewart.<br/><br/>Technically, the film maintains the good CGI, visible in the work of the wolves but is more discreet in its visual and computational resources than the previous film. The soundtrack this time is signed by Carter Burwell and is very good. Good scenarios, props, and very good images of large-scale landscapes complete the technical work. I particularly liked the cinematography of scenes with the wedding or the sex scene, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen in cinema, without excessive nudity, proving that it is not necessary to show ""the thing happening"" to make a good sex scene in cinema.<br/><br/>This film is the most romantic in the franchise, and the initial half is just honey, making us sick to the point of almost giving up on seeing the rest. It greatly improves the medium to the end, with the introduction of elements of tension and increasing danger to temper the excessive sweetness and to mask the failures of the main actors."

Why is Jacob always hanging around and warming her? Can't they stop this triangle hiccup? They are married now. Awful. Especially because the whole movie was made only because Bella couldn't keep her legs together. Everything that happened is because she wanted to smash.
She even listened to Rosalie to keep the baby although 3 movies were enough to make clear she wanted her dead anyway.

"SquigglyCrunch","3","0","1","25 August 2016"," Some Good Ideas, but Still Awful
","Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 follows Bella and Edward as they get married and embark on their honeymoon, only to find new trouble has occurred. <br/><br/>There were a handful of parts of this movie that I liked. When characters became unhealthy, they looked unhealthy. They actually looked really good in this particular instance. Otherwise there were a couple ideas that I thought were, although poorly explained at times, pretty cool and unpredictable. <br/><br/>Other than that, this movie suffers in almost every way the previous ones did. As per usual, we get some terrible performances from our three main leads. I don't know if I'm getting used to them or what, but I don't mind their acting as much anymore. Except Taylor Lautner, he still sucks big-time. Kristen Stewart was alright though. I think. She wasn't as annoyingly bad at acting as she was in the previous movies at least. Robert Pattinson is still better, but not by much. There was one performance that really stood out to me, however, and that was the one committed by Booboo Stewart. This was seriously one of the worst performances I've ever seen. He reminded me of Kristen Stewart's worst moments from the first movie, but it was all the time. He delivered these extremely cliché and overused lines with as much personality as a dying boulder. Try to imagine that. <br/><br/>I can't tell if the writing still sucks or if I'm used to it, but I think it's gotten better. Not much better, as proved by the lines written for Booboo Stewart's character, but it wasn't so unbearably or hilariously awful as it was previous. <br/><br/>The special effects still suck. The wolves themselves look like garbage. And then there was a baby made with CGI for some reason. I remembered hearing about that, but I could not have prepared myself for that. It looked hilariously fake. I loved it. It was probably the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>One thing in particular that really confuses me is the fact that everyone keeps saying that if a vampire were to engage in sexual intercourse with a human that it'd be dangerous, and yet I don't recall anyone ever stating why or how, or even stating that until someone just started saying it like everyone already knew it. A handful of other things were poorly or never explained at all, but this was the biggest thing. <br/><br/>And the make-up. Normally I wouldn't look at this, but the Cullens were super pale in all the previous movies and now they aren't. They're still pale, but not nearly as pale as before. They actually look human. In the previous movies it was hard to care for these characters because they didn't look real, and in turn they fit the exaggerated character stereotypes that they embodied. Now they look human, yet still maintain these personalities, which makes it hard to take them seriously as characters in a serious movie. They fit better in a Japanese anime than a live-action supposedly serious American movie like this one. Furthermore, the first three movies spent time developing characters that didn't feel or look like people, so in my mind that's exactly what they weren't. And now they're being treated like well-developed characters and it just doesn't work. The sudden shift doesn't make any real sense within the story, but I guess that's what you get with a new director for every movie. <br/><br/>Overall Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 has some good ideas, but it fails on every level the ones before it did. It's like a turd with ice cream on the other side of it. There's some good stuff, but you have to push through the crap to get to it. It's good for a Twilight movie, but that doesn't mean that it's actually good. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie."

","(Credit IMDb) The Quileutes close in on expecting parents Edward and Bella, whose unborn child poses a threat to the Wolf Pack and the towns people of Forks.<br/><br/>I saw this over a year ago, so my review may not be up to standard. I don't hate Twilight as many people do. I think most of them are watchable and mildly enjoyable (Aside from Breaking Dawn Part II) I can either take them or leave them. I like Kristen Stewart a lot, despite her bad reputation. I have to give this movie credit for exploring mature and controversial themes. There are quite a few scenes where it is quite unpleasant. Considering the cookie-cutter nature of this series, I was impressed by the mature subject matter. The honeymoon scenes with Stewart & Pattinson are corny, but admittedly enjoyable if you can get into the stuff. I'll always stand by my opinion that Bella has more chemistry with Jacob. It's just the way I see it. The birth scene is fitfully disturbing. I wasn't repulsed, but I did feel slightly uncomfortable. Kristen Stewart steps up her game as Bella, while Pattinson & Lautner do their thing. It does get a bit draggy at times with some pacing issues, but overall, I didn't mind it at all.

A little melodrama is fine, but it goes on for most of the movie, and when there is little hook of a story, it just becomes a drag. Even people who are fans to the series will admit that dialogue has never been its strong suit. Bill Condon attempts to make the sex scene and honeymoon to be tender, but it came off more sappy and overbearing.<br/><br/>""Part 1's"" strength is that it is the best-acted of the series. Stewart certainly gives it a good go and Lautner gives what is a half-way decent performance. Pattinson was slumming it, but with some of the cheesy dialogue he has to say, even someone like Laurence Olivier would have struggled.<br/><br/>Condon does have a few moments of visual darkness, including the dream sequence in the beginning with its juxtaposition of bright white clothing and blood and Bella and Edward standing on top of a load of corpses. The birth scene was actually intense and gory. But these are counter-balanced with goofy moments, one of the most infamous being a psychic werewolf argument.<br/><br/>The whole wedding sequence and honeymoon plays like a young girl's fantasy, sort of idealistic. This is fine, but hardly dramatic and not likely to have wide appeal.<br/><br/>Previous ""Twilight"" movies have had some interesting side issues that could and should have been explored. This is not the case with ""Part 1."" There are no issues of a man resisting his urges and dark side, a young teen forced into being a vampire, an army of powerful new vampires being formed and the idea of there being a vampire council. There is nothing like that. The few themes there are include a look into Edward's past, a brief debate about abortion and the idea of imprinting, which is basically brainwashing. A better idea could be looking at somebody forcing someone else to love them. That would be a dark story.<br/><br/>""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" is the weakest movie in the series so far and I speak as someone who is neutral to the overall experience."

","Finally Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart play their characters almost perfectly, and they're not the only ones. Billy Burke who has always been good has some great moments with Kristen. They seem to know their characters so well by now and it's wonderful to finally see. The much talked about sex scene was very sweet and romantic, the birthing scene was not as gruesome as I'd have liked it to be, but Kristen's performance in it was great.I felt her pain. Robert is also great in that scene. Vampires can't cry, but you can feel his loss. Taylor doesn't really bring anything to the movie. He pretty much walks around sulking throughout the movie. The only part I have a problem with is when Jacob separates himself from the pack. I felt like I entered a cartoon movie with their booming voices. It worked in the book, but in the movie they probably should have been human for that scene. The movie was definitely not rushed, and I can understand how someone who doesn't like twilight that much would find it boring and too long, but for hardcore twihards this is a pretty perfect adaptation of the first part of the novel."

For Edward and Bella to get married and it turned out alright but Jacob was mad at Edward because when they have a baby its going to hurt Bella. And it was amazing than any other Twilight movie I have seen so far. And then Edward and Bella has the baby but it's not just 1 its two babies. And its a great Romance movie if people like the Twilight Sega and Romance movies this movie is for you. I say buy it, its worth the money. But rent it first to see if you like it or not. Thank you this has been my review on this movie. Mostly this is a romance movie this movie has more romance in this movie than any. Its rated PG-13 it has parts in here that is not for little kids to see but its a heart warming movie and great special effects and I love movies like that. This movie is better than Harry Potter and Lord of the rings put together."
"EdwardNashtonReeves","4","0","1","8 February 2012"," Review as neither hater nor a fan
","I heard how many people are mad about Twilight and I heard how many people say it's the worst movie of the year. Then I decided to watch it myself and this is my totally unbiased review: <br/><br/>THE GOOD <br/><br/>Kristen Stewart actually did good as calm, yet romantic, emo-esque, mature and immature at the same time, Bella Swan. I also loved the way she acted when sick from pregnancy and especially loved the make-up/effects they put on her to look sick. It really did worked. Taylor Lautner was surprisingly OK as Jacob, his actions made sense and he acted like he really cares for Bella. Alice was cute as always. Billy Burke did a great role as Bella's father Charlie, maybe most convincingly human character in the story. Scenery was good, photographer did some really amazing shots, especially exterior, you can actually feel the warmth/coldness when needed in the woods and the rivers. Production design was cool too and costumes were fine, I mean it was obviously more costume supervising than designing, but it was just like it should be. The whole concept of concentrating on a relationship between a human and a vampire seems fun, and only thing I liked script-wise is that they decided to concentrate on one main storyline, cause in this case in particular, any side-story would be too distracting.<br/><br/>THE MEDIOCRE <br/><br/>Acting was just OK, but nothing special for most other actors. Interesting to see actors like Anna Kendrick, Michael Welch and Mia Maestro, otherwise great, to just be there to fulfill couple of badly written phrases. There was more of Nikki Reed this time, and I still cannot decide weather she did good or not. She wasn't terrible, but maybe bland, which is good for Stewart's character, but not everyone. CGI wolves and running was done adequately, but still unpleasantly surprised since Twilight is supposed to be earning millions and we all know how effects can be good these days. And background songs' lyrics were sometimes just too cheesy.<br/><br/>THE BAD <br/><br/>First of all, the whole movie is about weather Bella will survive pregnancy? Couldn't she abort as soon as she got pregnant? Why did she got pregnant anyway if she's human? Stephanie Meyer better have some good explanation on that one. And couldn't he make her a vampire when they got the news? Why is sex so violent? Didn't Meyer study Brahm Stocker and other vampire authors? Vampires drink human blood, but can do intercourse just like humans. I don't want to spoil the further plot, but it has some holes. And it's boring at times, same thing over and over again. Also, I must add that Edward Cullen is the most miserable character in modern literature that gets so much attention. Why? He is sexist, boring, obviously has diarrhea just to start with. Why on Earth would any girl go through all that just to be with him? So immature. And yeah, imprinting, sounds a lot like pedophilia. I mean, she was just born! Barely a newborn! I mean, it did save her life, but in that case, wouldn't it be better to present it as Jacob's sacrifice and sort of arranged, but never official and never consumed marriage, just for convenience. She's just a baby, and when she grows-up, wouldn't it be normal for her to pick who she'll really be with? It totally grossed me out! And Jacob had good chemistry with Leah, why not go with that? Much more appropriate! <br/><br/>THE VERDICT <br/><br/>Well, all given and taken, this movie could've been so much better! I give it 5 starts out of 10, but actually it's more like 4.5. It's still better than Spy Kids 4D, but it's too cheesy to be taken seriously."
"ashley-hinshaw10","9","0","6","7 February 2012"," Pleasantly Surprised
","I really liked this movie. Which shouldn't be taken lightly because after seeing the first movie, I almost set fire to the movie theater!! I was SO disappointed with the first movie, and found myself having to justify my feelings for the books over and over, while simultaneously trying to explain the real story to my friends and family who had never had the pleasure of reading the books. I do think though, since changing directors, that the movies have only improved. <br/><br/>While it can definitely be said that Stephanie Meyers isn't the best writer as far as grammar goes, and even her with her wording, she is a good story teller. So, to me, having the books made into movies is ideal. And since the stories are being told without her well-intended, but redundant and flawed writing getting in the way, they have the opportunity to be a true representation. <br/><br/>The fourth book was my favorite one and so I was very nervous and ready to be let down by this movie, but to my very pleasant surprise, I was quite impressed at how good it was! My biggest fear was that they would deviate from the story line, which they did do but not to the point where it ruined it. I do think that the movie could have been more subtle with the sex scenes, since the book had been quite graceful about them, and since their is a younger audience to be aware of. Other than that though, I was pleasantly surprised with Kristen's decision to express her emotions in such a strong way. In some parts of the movie, I genuinely felt and believed she was Bella. It's sad that it has taken her four movies to decide to be incredible, but better late than never I suppose.<br/><br/>And that's my review! Thanks for reading and God bless! ~Ashley"
"meganpreston99","7","0","5","5 February 2012"," The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1
","I was shocked when i read how many people slated this film in the reviews, this is the forth film in the saga so people who watch it should really know what to expect. It a love story and to me it was a good one if you enjoyed the other films and care about the characters you will enjoy this. Although there is not much fighting or action pact it is a good story and worth watching. As for slating the acting ability of the lead actress all i can say is, as she is not short of film roles, she must be doing something right. Other reviewers are not giving this film Any credit only highlighting the negatives being there's not much action and a little cheesy. I really enjoyed it and look forward to part 2."
"katiepink11-1","8","0","6","18 January 2012"," Best of the series
","I can't understand why people have rated this so low, as it is actually the best out of the whole series. The first one was boring and cheesy, the second one was just boring and I can't really complain much about the third. This one was slightly less of a teen film. I only have two bad things about this film. First, the way they've filmed the wolves conversations is like a bad sci-fi movie. There are much better ways to do it! Second, Kristen Stewart still only had one facial expression. Other than these problems I would recommend this film to anybody. It can get slightly gory in places, for example when she drinks the blood, but thats parents decision if they are OK with the kids watching it."
"tinamarie515","10","0","10","15 January 2012"," Cheese or not to Cheese? :p
","Best film of all the series. I have no idea why people insist on hating the Twilight Saga. I guess people just need to pick on something. I personally couldn't of enjoyed this movie more. Right from the beginning it had you on the edge of your seat wondering what would happen next. It had my full attention. I'm anxiously waiting for it to come out of DVD so I can purchase it and watch it over and over again of course :). One of the best modern day movie romances. Girls love it because the world lacks such romance and they yearn for their own Twilight love Saga. The guys hate it because they don't want to deal with the expectations this movie may bring upon them. Romance what? Romance Who? lol. Some find this film cheesy, but what's wrong with a little Cheese? Right? Cheese please! :D I hope you enjoy because I sure did!"

","DO you think this film is worth paying money to go to it? I think not because i loved all the twilight movies but not this one.<br/><br/>This movie is too cheesy and it has too much sex scenes also some scenes contain well.....weirdness! Let me give you a example there was a scene were Bella had to drink blood and she liked it! And let me give you another example when Bella wakes up (after the sex scene)she has a bruise on her arm and the top of the bed is broken how did that happen?<br/><br/>i think this film might be suitable for teens because i don't think children will like to see any of the sex's or birth scene and there's too much blood like when Bella dreamed that Edward killed all the guests at the wedding which happened because Edward warned Bella that he killed lots of people in the past and Bella got a bit frightened.<br/><br/>I think this film is forth seeing only for people who like blood,sex and weirdness.And i don't think you should go to the film alone you should go with your boyfriend or a friend if your a teen if your a child go with your parents! And thats my review so i think you should pay a cheaper price for this movie."
"skatamizz","8","0","8","8 January 2012"," A Great Film
","Carries on from the previous films as Bella goes through an emotional journey. Recommended by the legal badge-12A. Most twilight fans will enjoy the exiting drama and suspense. Otherwise, the birth scene may be found disturbing for some. There is a lot of blood, so not recommended to those who are squeamish. According to reports the birthing scene in the movie has caused in-theatre seizures known as photosensitive epilepsy. It's believed that the bright flashing of red and black colours is causing the incidents. Personally, I enjoyed this film, due to intense plot and dramatic scenes. But this may not be everyone's cup of tea."
"odconsultantspk","10","0","11","31 December 2011"," Interesting Suspense
","I watched this movie in theater. I am giving 10 points to this movie. This movie has everything. Drama, Suspense, Thrill, horror and sex. You will never bore to watch this movie. A story starts with the news of wedding ceremony which is going to happen between Vampire boy and normal human girl. <br/><br/>Friends and others knows very well that this union will danger for the life of girl. Especially this couple can not intercourse with each other. Otherwise the girl will be died. Any how couple made a successful intercourse and she became pregnant. Watch this movie with your wife only."
"ana_carolas","6","0","6","29 December 2011"," Not bad at all!
","First of all let me say that I'm a fan of the books. I enjoyed the theme and the story itself. So, when I saw the movies I was already prepared for the lame dialogues, specially between Bella and Edward. Even with these lame moments I must say I enjoyed this last movie. It portrays really well what happens in the book and it didn't disappoint me. Regarding the acting, I thought Kristen Stewart finally delivered a convincing performance. I think this is a movie that only fans will like and only they will appreciate the time that was given to portray the evolution in the relationship between the characters. When the movie ended it left me with the desire to see the last one soon which, in my opinion, means that it was not a bad movie at all!"
"jmrdolgner","7","0","6","28 December 2011"," It's Twilight. You already know if you like it.
","Here's the good, the bad, and I don't know what.<br/><br/>|GOOD|: As with any book-to-movie adaptation, things will get left out, changed, or even added in. I have no complaints about how this was done in Breaking Dawn - Part 1. All the major points were there and it all still made sense. The music worked well throughout the movie, particularly during the wedding scene. Their reuse of ""Flightless Bird, American Mouth"" didn't feel cheap. It felt appropriate for the scene.<br/><br/>Kudos to the makeup artist for when Bella was pregnant. She looked truly skeletal, which made for good contrast during her vampire transformation. Bella's transformation sequence was interesting to watch. The baby looked better than I had expected, and the glimpses into what she will look like later were nice. It made Jacob's imprinting less creepy than some people make it sound.<br/><br/>The overlapping chaotic voices of the wolf pack was great. We know that the pack can hear all of each other's thoughts and you can't exactly turn your brain off, so everyone's voice overlapping made sense.<br/><br/>There were some memorable funny moments that kept the movie from being completely cancerous. The best of which was arguably the toasts during the reception. It was nice for them to be awkward on purpose (Emmet's sleeping line) rather than the unintentional awkward prominent in the films.<br/><br/>|BAD|: I have given up the hope that certain actors will open their mouths to speak and stop mumbling their lines. When I first heard that Breaking Dawn was being split into two movies, I must admit that the first thing I said was ""Well of course. How else will they fit in the horrible pauses between each line?"". This is the fourth movie however and I suppose I should be used to it. <br/><br/>At the other end of the spectrum, Some of the wolf voices were so over the top I had to laugh at them. It was mostly Sam, a bit of Jacob and a few other nameless wolves who thought they were in a Disney movie. Hopefully they'll be able to re-record that scene for the DVD. The scene also felt compacted. Jacob and Seth being made to bow down and Jacob becoming Alpha could have been dragged out longer. It would have been nice to have a scene before that with the wolves talking just to get the audience used to it. Perhaps there will be some of that in the next movie. <br/><br/>I also hope some of the sound effects will be taken out in the DVD. The squelchy chompy noises when Edward was biting Bella were so weird it was humorous.<br/><br/>|UP IN THE AIR|: I'm not sure about the pre-wedding dream sequence. I don't think it was necessary and looking back to the book There was a different dream there that I would much rather have seen. But that would have required that they talk about immortal children at some point before then which I don't think would have fit in well with the dialogue. <br/><br/>The wedding night was just as I'd expected. I was more interested in Bella's preparations and freak out than the actual sex in both the book and the movie, but that may be just me. <br/><br/>When it showed the venom spreading through Bella's system my first thought was ""House?"" but after I got over that it was okay. the transformation sequence could have been made to look more organic. It was not immediately apparent that this was more of a transition over a three day period.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that most of the wolf fights they added in most of the movies were just for the guys who were dragged to the theatre against their will.<br/><br/>|Final Thoughts|: If you liked the other Twilight movies, you will like this one. If you're reading this review before you see the movie, There's a clip in the middle of the credits. stick around for that. It's cool. If you don't like the Twilight movies, this isn't going to change your mind. (rant)and while I'm thinking about it. This is movie four! You should know whether or not you like it by now. If you don't like it, why did you see it? More importantly, why are you trolling the forums about it. Just ignore it.(end-rant) In my opinion, these movies have been getting better with each one and Breaking Dawn - Part 1 did not deviate from that pattern."
"livvychambers","8","0","7","28 December 2011"," Brilliant!
","This film is fantastic, if you liked the other movies you'll love this! It's very cleverly done and leaves you wanting more at the end, stays very true to the book. I think any twilight fan would love this movie regardless of other reviews on here. It's a fantastic film and I will be buying the DVD when it's released. I will not give anything away, but if you have read the book, it is not as disturbing as you may expect during certain parts. However, it is a 12 for a reason and although my younger sister who is 9 watches the Harry potter saga where some are 12's, she will not be watching the twilight saga! It's the perfect length for a movie,not too long but long enough. It's definitely a good idea to split the final book into two films so you can achieve the write amount f detail. Overall, brilliant."

","Breaking Dawn Part 1 is the best movie ever. It is love, fantasy, action and suspense all tied into one. I am a huge Twilighter so I enjoyed this movie very much. My sister and I went to the midnight premiere! I was crying and laughing during the movie, it's soooo good! All the Twilight Saga movies are amazing, but this one is my favorite. It kept me on the edge of my seat! I didn't want it to end! Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner are such extraordinary actors it's crazy! So are all the other actors;) Now if you don't believe me from this^^ Let me tell you. The theaters were packed! The lines were ridiculously long...... And everybody at my school was talking about how fantastic it was! Except the haters. But.... HATERS GON' HATE. :DD This movie is the bessst. Even if you aren't a Twilighter you will still loooovve this movie(: TEAM EDWARD<33"
"PoisonKeyblade","10","0","9","11 December 2011"," A fun film that's oodles better than the book
","As flawless as anything from Stephenie Meyer is going to get. The makeup and special effects- work in this film were absolutely stunning, and Bella's transformation into a weak, powerless shell carrying a child inside her was magnificent. Once again, Taylor Lautner shows off his acting chops (he even has an intense crying scene this time!). Shockingly, the haircuts and costumes were the best out of all the films in this movie. Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) who normally looks absolutely ridiculous, manages to actually have decent hair for once. There are a few things that seem just as dumb on screen as they did on the page (Jacob imprints on Renesmee? The name Renesmee?), but for the most part, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg works with Stephenie to craft something much better than was actually in the book. The birthing scene alone has a lot of power to it. The cinematography was great and, as always, I totally loved the soundtrack (which was kind of a mix of indie and pop/rock). I honestly don't feel there's any proper way they can make Part 2 cinematically pleasing, because the last half of Meyer's novel was an absolute trainwreck. Here's hoping that it's even halfway as good as this one."

I am very proud of the outcome of the movie and can not wait until part two come out. The movie was great and I just can not wait for the second part to come out. I don't think it will be as popular yet I think it's going to get a lot of praise like Harry Potter.

","OK Im biased as a Twilight fan I've been awaiting this film forever, but even so it was brilliant, I was most anxious about when Jacob would see and imprint on Renesmee, but it turned out for me the highlight of the film, the only downside i'm sorry to say is that it now seems there's a whole year till part 2 so how many times can i see part 1 again till then yippee seriously though I don't just recommend this film for twi-hards, any fans of vampire films should take a look, its a really deep romance and the action is great too, and admit it guys I've seen quite a few males reading the books now, so obviously vampires hold appeal for both sexes. Highly recommended If you don't like Twilight fine, but I recommend you at least give the film a go"
"jboothmillard","5","0","7","28 November 2011"," The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1
","From director Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters, Dreamgirls), the final instalment was going to be a big deal for the fans of the Twilight series, based on the books by Stephanie Meyer, but it would be the same story as the final Harry Potter, split into two parts, this is the first part. Basically Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is getting ready to marry her true love, vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), much to the dismay of Bella's one off werewolf love interest Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). The happy day comes along, and though she was noticeably nervous Bella and Edward do get married, and Jacob shows up in time to show his happiness for her at the reception, but also he anger at the fact that they may consummate the marriage. The newly joined couple spend their honeymoon in the tropical paradise of a private island villa in Brazil, and both of them, although hesitant, do have sex together for the first time. He spots that she is bruised and says he will never have sex with her again, but after doing nothing but some games of chess, running about through the forests, and jumping of cliffs into waterfall pools, he does eventually give in to temptation. Two weeks later however Bella wakes up feeling unwell and like something is inside her, it may be impossible but she already pregnant with a foetus growing at an extraordinarily fast rate, and they have no choice but to rush back to Forks. She refuses, even with the pleading of the Cullens, to have an abortion and wants to keep the child, and she gets Rosalie Hale (Nikki Reed) to help her take care of the coming baby's every need. Sam Uley (Chaske Spencer) of the werewolf clan wants Bella and the child to be killed, Jacob refuses to help and he leaves the pack to protect and help his former lover in any way he can. The pregnancy continues and Bella grows increasingly sick and her health deteriorates, she may die, and the group decide that the most likely thing to help is to feed the baby blood, so the mother to be starts drinking it, and it does work. Eventually Bella goes into a highly painful labour, she gives birth to a daughter that they give the unusual name Renesmee, but she is still dying of the complications, and the only way to help is Edward injecting with his curse and turning her into a vampire. She seems to die before the effects of the vampire curse can take over and make her immortal, and angered Jacob changes his mind about the baby, trying to kill it, but there is something about the baby that stumps him, an ""imprinting"". The other werewolves find out that Bella has apparently died, and they also try to kill the baby, but they are stopped by this imprinting too, this is a law in the pact between vampires and werewolves. The final moments see baby Renesmee safe and sound, and the vampire venom did in fact course through the body of Bella, and her eyes open to reveal her pupils red, and we also see Aro Volturi (Michael Sheen) learning she is now a vampire, and he says that his dispute with her and the Cullens in not over. Also starring Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, Peter Facinelli as Dr. Carlisle Cullen, Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Hale, Anna Kendrick as Jessica Stanley, Maggie Grace as Irina Denali, Jamie Campbell Bower as Caius, MÃ­a Maestro as Carmen Denali and MyAnna Buring as Tanya Denali. The three leads as with the other three films are likable enough, the screen time between Stewart and Pattinson is good, the story is much more simple compared to the previous instalments, and there are many moments to keep you interested, e.g. Bella and Edward having sex for the first time, Bella pregnant and starting to drink blood, and the slow transformation. I personally do not understand why the critics only give this first part in the final of the series two stars out of five, I thought it was actually quite cool and the most interesting of the whole series, if I really had to pick (I'm not a Twihard LOL), a good romantic horror fantasy. Worth watching!"
"icegini","9","0","8","27 November 2011"," Trying to get as much money out of the final without enough in return
","I was surprised when I watched the first Twillight movie that I liked it. Vampire movies are not the kind of movies I normally like and all the hype around it wasn't attracting me either. But I surprisingly enjoyed the first movie. A day later I watched the second and third one. The second movie was a bit disappointing but the third one made up first it again and felt at the same level like the first.<br/><br/>Yesterday I went to watch the first part of the fourth movie to spend some times with friends. Already not being really a fan of the movies but having enjoyed the first ones, this kind of movies must be pretty good for me to like them. I was okay with the beginning because it had potential, it changed fast in a let's put as much as possible into the movie but all fast and short just so that you know it happened and you've seen it. The hardest job after a movie has sequels which score well with the public is managing to make a good last movie I think. Unfortunately hey didn't manage for the Twillight saga.<br/><br/>I am curious about how the second part will be but as the first part gave me a bit an uninterested feeling and the end kind of makes you already know how the second part might go, it won't be a movie I will be watching in the movie theatre."
"tugce-tunalilar","5","0","8","20 November 2011"," what is expected
","I watched it yesterday. Now there is this, I don't want to call it boring, but rather lacking in action. Especially in the first half, they dealt with wedding and honeymoon scenes. Therefore, as a result, people who want action are bored of these scenes, including myself as well. However, at least they were loyal to the book and the wedding and honeymoon scenes were handled in a detailed way. I think this is something positive for the people who think that movies should be loyal to their books - but then again of course not every detail could be screened.<br/><br/>There was more action in the second half, especially with the birth scene. It was actually one of the few scenes that i was awaiting in the film. In addition, I think they were really successful at making Bella look much slimmer, because while watching the movie I did not understand that it was a computer effect. The computer effects were in general successful, especially in the wolf scenes, just like the other films of the series.<br/><br/>And there is also another point that from such a book, such a move would be expected. I did not have high expectations considering it was the ""first part"", so I was not disappointed. Was it a really good movie? No, but I think it was successful considering the book. I think what should be focused on is how the book is translated onto the film, since the topic of the book is what was handled in the movie."
