","""Atonement"" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. <br/><br/>Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. <br/><br/>In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.<br/><br/>After ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""Becoming Jane"", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in ""The Last King"" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in ""Becoming Jane"" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after ""Pride and Prejudice"". Although she was good in the comedy ""Bend it like Beckham"", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. <br/><br/>This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a good film, but ""Atonement"" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. <br/><br/>If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. ""Atonement"" joins that list of films (""Far from Heaven"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing ""Dear Lord and Father of Mankind"". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, ""Forgive Our Foolish Ways""- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.<br/><br/>Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10"
"b_morelos","10","84","107","5 March 2008"," Best adaptation of a novel ever!
","I usually don't like watching novels turned into movies (specially when I liked the novel as much as I liked McEwan's ""Atonement"") but this was a really pleasant surprise. The plot is extraordinarily well adapted, leaving out what cannot possibly be included in a two-hour film, changing very few details to translate literary language to cinematographic language but sticking to the essence and the spirit of the novel.<br/><br/>I really believe that if you enjoyed McEwan's novel, you will fall for this beautiful film. If you have never read McEwan, you will fall for the intriguing and thrilling story written by this wonderful English novelist.<br/><br/>Please, don't miss this one!"
"PizzicatoFishCrouch","9","156","207","26 August 2007"," Beautiful, sad, and McAvoy excels as usual.
","13-year-old Briony Tallis is a girl with a huge imagination who loves to write. The film starts at her completion of a play, ""The Trials of Arabella"", a morality tale on love and the dangers of being too hasty with one's emotions. From her opening line in the prologue, various multisyllabic words that I didn't understand were employed, and the audience giggles at her pretension: evidently, this is a girl whose world is shaped with words, regardless of whether or not she understands them. Witnessing her sister Cecilia dive into a pool as their housekeeper's son Robbie watches after her, Briony pictures as scene she has no understanding of, and, by the end of the day, she will have changed lives for the worse, and she will spend the rest of her life regretting and trying to atone this mistake.<br/><br/>The first act of the film, set in the picturesque country house, effectively conveys the sweltering heat of the British Summer and the mental unrest that comes with it. The camera never stays still, and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey even used Christian Dior stockings over the lenses to portray the heat and its effects on the residents. As Briony starts thinking about what she doesn't understand, trying to write a play of it, Dario Marianelli's haunting score, which features the rhythmic tapping of typewriter keys, reverberates in the background, to continually remind the audience that something bad is about to happen. The dramatic quality of the film is heightened with different events are replayed from different perspectives to show what something has the appearance of being, and what it really is. This device, though not new, works excellently for Atonement.<br/><br/>The second act of the film, set 4 years later, is much grittier and less pretty to watch. Robbie is now a soldier in France, and pines to get back to Cecelia. The horrors of war are not underplayed, and in one excellently-filmed tracking shot, the camera meanders through a chaotic mess of soldiers. Robbie, who had turned out so well before, has not lost practically all of his beauty, and retains only his accent. Similarly, back at home, soldiers with all sorts of disturbing injuries are shown. It is refreshing to see a film that, rather than portraying the war as some sort of patriotic honour, instead shows the horror and suffering that it causes.<br/><br/>In what could only be a nod to David Lean with his country houses, upper middle classes and epic romances, Joe Wright chose for his actors to give performances of the pre-Lee Strasburg era. And the cast rise up to the challenge admirably. As the young Briony, Saoirse Ronan is pitch-perfect, conveying her youthful innocence as well as whiny nosiness. Her sense of knowing about things she clearly doesn't is infuriating, but Ronan prevents us from denouncing her entirely, reminding us that she is, after all, just a child. Keira Knightley, who will be keen to forget her ""performance"" in her other 2007 venture, Pirates of the Caribbean III, doesn't do anything majorly wrong here, and at times even earns the audience's respect and sympathies as the loyal lover. Romola Garai plays the older, more wise Briony with conviction and a touch of sadness.<br/><br/>But the star of the show is the one, the only, James McAvoy. In the Q&A that followed the screening of the film, director Joe Wright described Robbie as the highest form of a human being, and he is. Even after he is put in the war to avoid staying in prison for longer, he does not whinge about it, but instead, gets through the day with the hope of seeing Cecelia guiding him through. James McAvoy plays this special individual with compassion and understanding. He has the accent and physicality of Robbie down to a T, but, more importantly, conveys his goodness, without ever having to resort to histrionics. McAvoy's performance is a masterclass in subtle acting. In some pivotal scenes, it is actually his beautiful blue eyes that do the acting more than anything, and they speak more words than Briony's ostentatious prose ever could.<br/><br/>There is more than a little similarity between Atonement and The Go-Between. Both tell of love between different classes, and an intruding message carrier between the two. Furthermore, Sarah Greenwood's sensuous set design (in the first act) and accurate war holes (in the second), along with the sound design, which features buzzing bees, works cleverly on a subconscious level to add to the tension. Indeed, Atonement is a technically and visually stunning film. The hues in the first act are almost overly saturated with richness, and this contrasts starkly to the second act, where cold hospital wards and mucky brown war dugouts fill the screen. The costumes are all realistic and accurate, though I personally favour the glamorous designs of the first half, which include a mesmerizing green dress that Cecelia wears. The cinematography, which encompasses long takes, tracking shots, lingering pans all attribute to the visual flair of the movie. But the key stylistic element that stood out for me, was the score. The piano theme is elegiac and melancholy, and the cello and violins also add to the sadness of the romance. Also, the use of a typewriter as an instrument, though started oddly, soon becomes infectious and it even forces its way into viewer's minds, making Robbie's note (and the consequences) unforgettable.<br/><br/>Joe Wright and Working Title have made a film to be proud of. Amidst some incredible scenes (such as an extremely erotic library non-reading session between Robbie and Cecelia). The quality and calibre of films that Working Title have turned out recently have been brilliant (Pride & Prejudice, Hot Fuzz, etc) and Atonement ranks up there along with my personal favourites Dead Man Walking and The Hudsucker Proxy. It is a wonderfully crafted, beautifully lush and immensely moving film that shows, above all, how storytelling can both destroy and heal."
"chelseachelsea","8","336","464","20 August 2007"," Great interpretation of a wonderful novel
","I saw a preview of this film yesterday and felt privileged to be one of the first people to see the film. It was also a pleasure to see a film before reading any other critical review or opinion. I am a great fan of Ian Mcewan and was concerned that it would not be possible to capture the subtleties and nuances of Mcewan's writing but I needn't have had any worries. The director, Joe Wright and screenplay writer Christopher Hampton have done a superb job and the complexities of the novel are superbly captured with real imagination. The story is set in three main areas, an English country house in 1935, war torn France 1940 and London 1940. The atmosphere in of all three are wonderfully captured by the director, cinematographer, costume design and score and I am sure that there are going to be some Oscar nominations for these. James McAvoy as lead man gives a tremendous performance of a restrained but passionate man. I was not as convinced by Keira Knightley's performance and am not sure that her acting has the mature edge to capture the social nuances of the times that McAvoy did so successfully. Do not see this film if you like fast paced films and rapid plot development! This is not a film for the pop video generation. If however you like character development and a plot that unravels at a pace that allows you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the film then I can highly recommend Atonement as one of the best films that I have seen this year."
"CubsandCulture","10","8","8","9 February 2020"," I am not sure why Dunkirk got made when this film exists
","I deeply appreciate Atonement for other reasons and while the films are about 10 years apart I am utterly perplexed by how Nolan's Dunkirk became the critical darling it is, especially since this film exists. This film isn't about the evacuation of Dunkirk or WWII (those elements form the background for a fully realized troubled romance and family drama) and YET this film spends about 20 minutes on Dunkirk and it conveys the horror, defeat and dread of it it far sharper and more resonant than Nolan's film does for its entire run time. There is a one very long shot of soldiers on the beach that even manages to capture the whole what is time when facing your death thing better than Nolan's film.<br/><br/>With that being said I most appreciate the soft, luminous cinematography and the very atypical score in this film. Indeed atypical flourishes-the split perspective, the inserted fiction within the narrative, what's being atoned for etc.-greatly elevate a sweeping romance that might have been too conventional if the film played it straight up. It is really the details-sometimes as small as word choice-that really make this film a ravishing epic.<br/><br/>Doomed romances rest on their casting and I can say that both Knightley and McAvoy don't disappoint. McAvoy especially is really sexy, beautiful and emotional in this in that perfectly restrained British way. It may be his career best performance. Good film. It is much better than No Country for Old Men."
"evanston_dad","7","254","353","17 December 2007"," One Third of ""Atonement"" Is Brilliant
","The first third of ""Atonement"" is superb. We are introduced to a group of affluent English aristocrats whiling away their summer hours at a massive estate. One of them, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is nursing a raging case of sexual attraction to her childhood friend and now family gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), while another, Cecilia's young sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), spends her day writing a play which she plans to perform for a family gathering later that evening. Everyone is bored and listless in the summer heat. Briony, prey to an overactive imagination, keeps witnessing a series of increasingly serious moments of intimacy between Cecilia and Robbie that she isn't old enough to fully understand, and finally a false accusation by her is responsible for sending Robbie away from the estate in handcuffs. Everything about this part of the film is brilliant. The director Joe Wright ratchets the sexual tension to an almost unbearable pitch, and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen.<br/><br/>But then the story and movie switched gears, and it lost some of that narrative momentum it had been so wonderfully building. The second and third acts of the film, while accomplished, do not deliver on the promise set up in the film's first part, and the movie never really succeeded in sucking me back in. When we next see Robbie, he's wandering through the desolate battlefields of WWII France, pining for Cecilia and nursing a chest wound. Wright shows off mightily in this part of the film; there's an astounding ten-minute tracking shot that depicts the allied forces on the beach of Dunkirk that will have cineastes slobbering. But like Robbie's mind, this part of the film starts to wander aimlessly, and even while I was admiring the sheer planning that went into this amazing shot, I couldn't help but wish that Wright would just get on with it already.<br/><br/>Finally, the film circles back to Briony, four years older and working as a nurse tending to the wounded. She's suffering a tremendous amount of guilt for the wrongs she's only now beginning to understand and wants to reach out to Cecilia (from whom she's now estranged) and Robbie to offer her apologies. I've not read the Iam McEwan novel on which this film is based, but even I could tell that this is where the screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, had the most trouble adapting the novel to the screen. Much of what ""Atonement"" is about becomes clear in this last act, as Briony ages into Vanessa Redgrave, a successful novelist who has finally written a novel that works as an outlet for her devastating feelings of guilt. We begin to realize here that ""Atonement"" isn't as much about the love affair between Cecilia and Robbie as it is about the act of writing and the power of words. Briony learns as a little girl how difficult words are to take back once they've been said; as an adult, she learns the ability of words to help us deal with regret. One particular scene that takes place between Cecilia, Robbie and Briony is a fiction inserted into their story by Briony the novelist; it's the story as she wishes it had been rather than as it actually was. Briony the woman can't change the past, but Briony the novelist can.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful idea, but unfortunately the screenplay doesn't quite know how to communicate this in cinematic terms, so it's told directly to the audience by Redgrave in a monologue at the film's conclusion. Redgrave is a luminous actress, but her soliloquy feels awkwardly inserted into the film. As for the other actors, they all do fine work. The young actress Saoirse Ronan is especially good, and James McAvoy proves further that he's becoming one of the finest young actors working today. But the screenplay sort of abandons him and Knightley after its first half hour or so to a warmed over version of ""The English Patient,"" and the strong impact they both make early on dissipates gradually.<br/><br/>I admired ""Atonement"" for how it looked and the ideas it had to express, but I think it's an uneven film that doesn't entirely work.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"jayceetees","10","381","542","16 September 2007"," Atonement - a feast for the eyes.
","My wife and I went to see the movie last night and were totally blown away by the whole experience. So brilliantly directed and acted. The movie time just flew by and we were drawn in and captivated by each dramatic moment. Never having read the book or been an expert on WW2, I had a truly open mind on what to expect and I'm not one of those who count every rivet or go looking for technical inaccuracies however small. This was truly a masterpiece of cinematography. We were treated to wonderful performances, lavish sets, shocking and thought-provoking moments and haunting themes. I had the privilege of being an extra in the Redcar, Dunkirk scene and once seen in its full glory and effect on the big screen I was simply in awe and glad to have been a part of it. Walking along Redcar beach from now on will never quite be the same again. I am quite sure that the movie will win a number of awards within the next 12 months, but that is not what really matters. Movies are there to entertain, tell a story and affect you emotionally and by God this did it in spades! If you have not seen it yet, you must!"
"seawalker","9","336","478","10 September 2007"," Pure poetry on film
","My brain tends to turn to mush in the presence of greatness. This makes it difficult when I want to write about something that I thought was truly great. It is so much easier to write about something that is rubbish.<br/><br/>Oh, well. Here goes.<br/><br/>I thought that ""Atonement"" was terrific. It is a really great movie. Obviously it is early days yet, and there are a lot of contenders still to appear, but ""Atonement"" might just be the winner-in-waiting of the Best Film Oscar in 2008. Put your money on it now.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" is pure poetry on film. From the hazy, dreamy, hopeful days of 1935, a destructive act of spite, the horrors of Dunkirk (with one of the most fantastic long takes I have seen in a cinema for a very long), to the aftermath and a devastating ""happy"" ending, it is a magnificent and moving film, beautifully directed by Joe Wright.<br/><br/>I have never really rated Keira Knightley or understood her popularity. Except for her role in ""Pride & Prejudice"" (for which she was perfectly cast) I have tended to refer to her as Girl-Who-Would-Be-Winslet, as I thought that she had not played a single role that Kate Winslet could not have done better. Maybe I won't say that anymore. ""Atonement"" is easily the best thing Keira Knightley has done.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley has had a lot of the press over here, but we should not forget to mention the pitch perfect performances from James McAvoy and Romola Garai. They share as much screen time as La Knightley and are as impressive.<br/><br/>Wonderful film.<br/><br/>Gushing over."
"simonparker1990","10","592","876","10 September 2007"," If this doesn't win Best Picture next year it will have been robbed!
","Its very rare that a movie like Atonement comes along and leaves me completely speechless and in complete and utter awe for hours after I have seen it. You see Atonement isn't just the best movie I have seen all year, its one of the best movies I have seen in a very, very long time. And by that I include Pan's Labyrinth, yes this movie is better than my favourite movie of 2006, and I never imagined Atonement would ever come close to that level of greatness until fifteen minutes into the movie last night. Atonement is an unusual movie, in fact its fair to say that I have never seen anything quite like it. Its a rare movie that actually I adored so much that I am going to hunt down a copy of the book tomorrow just to see the comparisons. Its not an easy movie I'll be honest, if you go in expecting something light hearted and easy to digest then you will leave the cinema feeling very cheated. This is a movie that deals with very dark things at times. No matter how much I desire to write in depth about every aspect of the movie I just can't, the movies greatest triumph is the fact that its plot is so intricately woven that if you ruin one part of the storyline to anyone then the movies impact is slightly lessened. The storyline is just brilliant, but its the climax that leaves you in store for the biggest shocker, and its this shocker that leaves you reeling long after you have left the cinema. The performances here are all spectacular, I think its fair to say that the two leads, James McAvoy and Keira Knightly shall be receiving at the very least nominations for Best Actor/Best Actress. The score is beautiful, whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves to be praised heavily. Its rare a score leaves me feeling moved, the score in this movie did that for me. That's yet another Oscar that this movie deserves to win. All in all Atonement is just perfection, I doubt you'll find a better movie this year or even for the next three years. In a time when Blockbusters get all the attention it is nice to see a small, but intelligent movie leave me in awe.<br/><br/>As I previously mentioned the performances in this movie is simply amazing. Keira Knightly is an odd actress, while she proved herself in Pride and Prejudice, yes I have unfortunately seen that movie, she comes across as a wooden actress in films like Pirates of the Caribbean. Atonement really sees her at her best yet. Her character is different from what we've seen Knightly play before. Usually she goes for the spunky females, this time she seems more like a proper lady, albeit one that smokes constantly and is a bit stuck up for her own good. Keira Knightly excels in the earlier, more laid back sequences, but its in the later stuff, the more powerful stuff that we see just how talented an actress she truly is. Despite all my praise for Knightly she still plays second fiddle to James McAvoy. The former actor of Shameless and Narnia is on a roll lately. His excellent, although sadly overlooked performance in The Last King of Scotland still sticks firmly in memory. But his performance here is simple breathtaking. One sequence in particular where we see his acting talent come to light has to be the sequence in Dunkirk (more on that later), no words but the performance says everything. Knightly might not be certain to win an Oscar, but McAvoy surely is! Its also refreshing to see a young actress, Saoirse Ronan, not be eye gougingly irritating, but rather a superb actress. Her character, Briony, is a vital character in the movie, and for such a young actress she delivers her performance so chillingly brilliant. Unfortunately next to this brilliant performance, Romola Garai who plays an older Briony pales in comparison. Her performance is still brilliant, but not as effective nor as memorable as the younger actress. <br/><br/>The storyline of Atonement is where the film holds most of its impact. Essentialy the film is about a lie that Briony tells, and how it affects the lives of her, Cecilia, and most importantly of all, Robbie. That's pretty much all I can and will say of the storyline. A lot more happens over the course of the movie, and a lot of stuff that you think will happen doesn't, and things you think won't happen will. The ending is a prime example of this and to be honest I didn't see it coming. The way the movie is directed is also something note. The beautiful colours of the summer house are amazing, but the way the camera moves around the house makes it even better. But the direction will be remembered for one scene in this movie, and its in Dunkirk. I mentioned this previously for the performance in that scene, what I failed to mention is that the shot is a continuous shot that lasts five minutes as we see the chaos of Dunkirk. From horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel, the sequence is shown in all its glory. It really is a powerful moment, and probably the one scene that got me closest to tears, purely because of the singing in the background, it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly is.<br/><br/>Overall Atonement is a perfect movie, in actual fact its a movie with pretty much no flaws whatsoever. Superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline to die for. It is unlikely any film will top this for a very long time, this is something that will go down in cinema history as being a classic, and it highly deserves it inevitable status."
"mysterious_boy_92","10","109","155","7 February 2008"," Amazing!!! Favourite Romantic Movie.
","I was completely stunned when I watched Atonement yesterday. From the funny lines to the sad moments, this movie does not fail to amaze me. James McAvoy is by far the shining star in this movie, endowed with unfailing charisma and absolutely adoring accent. The score was impeccable, especially the sound of the typewriter. I loved the scenes from Dunkirk, the hospital, and ,of course, the mansion. It's truly an amazing movie that I consider to be the best of 2007's. The ending was rather sad, but it fits perfectly. Keira Knightley was ineffably wonderful with her charming beauty and brilliant performance. One should really go and watch it because it's a fulfilling experience. I personally give it 10/10."
"MissMovieLuver88","10","148","225","16 September 2007"," Stunning, absolutely stunning
","Based on Ian McEwan's award wining novel of the same name, Atonement tells the story of A British romance that spans several decades. Fledgling writer Briony Tallis, as a 13-year-old, irrevocably changes the course of several lives when she accuses her older sister's lover of a crime he did not commit.<br/><br/>I've waited several months to see Joe Wright's second feature film ""Atonement"" and it did not disappoint. For an only second feature film by 35 old Joe Wright, it's absolutely astonishing. Directed superbly on all levels. From the stunning Dunkirk visuals, to several Point of view shots empathising each character's need and feelings at that point, you can't help but feel intertwined in the story and with the characters. I haven't seen such an epic of a film since The English Patient, I hope it continues to do well at the box office and worldwide, as it deserved to. I haven't read the novel, so I will do soon.<br/><br/>There are many sensational tracking shots in this, which I loved. For instance, in the Dunkirk scene, we walk with Robbie and see the devastation through his eyes, just amazing. At the beginning, Briony's view of Robbie and Celia is done through two perspectives. One being what Briony believe has happened and two the real truth, this creates a dilemma for the audience as you don't really know who to believe at that point. One shot I loved was of Briony's eye, an extreme close-up almost giving a clue to the viewer. As I mentioned before, I can not believe that Wright has produced such a masterpiece of a film, in only his second feature.<br/><br/>The Dunkirk, scene is something to be remembered. Watching it at the cinema, I was so taken aback by the extraordinary beauty of the scene. The cinematography is sensational. It captures the mood of that time, so well that you can put yourself in there. What works is that you think what you're seeing is real, and everything in every frame of that scene. I can't really describe the words, as it won't really doesn't do justice to what I thought of the scene but let's just say I'm still thinking about it now and will always. Subsequently that scene has to be up there with some of the best war scenes ever created for the silver screen, and I don't often say that unless it's seriously something that has left me speechless beyond any recognition- that hasn't happened. Some other scenes to mention are; Celia and Briony's estate like house and the scenery and the wartime London are also sensational. Plus, there done in such a way you wouldn't expect a 21st century film to make.<br/><br/>As for the acting, that was wonderful from every actor in the picture. Keira Knightly does brilliantly, as she did in Pride and Prejudice, which she deservedly got an Oscar nomination for that. However doing crap films like The Pirates Franchise doesn't do her acting talents any justice. These are the films she should be making as she has the ability to become one of the best British actresses of recent years; she just needs to keep well away from blockbusters. I'm sure she'll gain her 2nd nomination at next years Oscars. However the REAL sensation n this film is James MacAvoy. For me he outshone Knightly on all levels, playing Robbie Turner so, so well that you believed in the character more that Knightly's. I don't quite know how to explain but I'm sure you'll know what I mean when you see it. MacAvoy's performance was so exquisitely done that I almost cried for the first time in a cinema. I'm hopeful MacAvoy will gain his first nomination at the Academy awards. I hope he is in chance of winning one this year, I will jump for joy if he does as he deserves it more than anyone in this film. I must not forget the incredibly supporting cast, from young Saoirse Ronan who brilliantly played Briony aged 13 ,Romola Garai who played Briony aged 18 and the great Vanessa Redgrave(older Briony) who moved me to tears with her final speech at the end. I hope the Academy recognises at least one of those actresses, because they all deserve some recognition.<br/><br/>That soundtrack is stunning beyond words. It brilliantly blends in the mood of that period with every scene that you understand what's going on and the scene becomes visually engaging. I'm sure this score will be Oscar nominated! Finally, I'm sure Antonement will be nominated in several category's at the 2008 Academy awards as it should and deserved to. I haven't seen such an outstanding British film as his for a while now. Although The Queen came close last year, Atonement is the one for me. This is a modern masterpiece and will become an instant classic, as did The English Patient did back in 1996. I hope you will all go out and see it when it reaches your local cinema, as you all should. The best film I've seen this year!"

Four years later, all three characters try to find their own personal sense of peace or redemption during WWII.<br/><br/>This brief synopsis does nothing to explain the intricate complexities of the plot and actions that take place. Although Keira Knightley's performance is slightly off-putting due to the fact she appears like she just escaped from a concentration camp (surely young British socialites did not look like this in the 1930's), the stunning cast shows full range here racing through curious emotions: spite, lust, recklessness, and selfish wanton abandon. The facial expressions, especially from the children in the early scenes on the estate, are priceless. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic as they are often vain, self-absorbed, and quite silly in their drama, but they are fascinating to watch. The first third of the film is played like a ""Masterpiece Theater"" production of ""The Great Gatsby"" as seen through the eyes of Nancy Drew.<br/><br/>However, what makes ""Atonement"" soar is the impeccable direction of Joe Wright. He makes the most audacious coming-of-age as an auteur since Anthony Minghella delivered ""The English Patient"" back in 1996. Wright displays a near Kubrickian mastery of sound effects (notice the strikes of the typewriter keys) that transition from scene to scene and often bleed into the amazing score from Dario Marianelli. Wright also crafts a finely textured mise-en-scene that visually translates McEwan's richly composed story onto the screen with near note perfect fashion. Nothing can really prepare you for how well directed this film is until you see it, and the scene of the three soldiers arriving on the beach at the Dunkirk evacuation is one of the greatest stand alone unedited panning long shots ever captured on film. It left me gasping.<br/><br/>That scene leads to the heart of the film. The often clichéd romance at the core is trumped by Wright's depiction of Robbie, a single man forlorn and obsessed, his dizzying inner turmoil reflected against the grand canvas of a chaotic world at war. Likewise, Briony's redemption comes not in the too-clever conclusion at the end of the film, but in the intimate and symbolic confessional at the bedside of a dying French soldier. These moments leave lasting impressions, and left me imagining that if Joe Wright were to ever adapt Irene Nemiorovsky's ""Suite Francaise"" onto the silver screen, he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave ""Gone With Wind"" spinning in its gilded Hollywood grave."

","The superb Ian McEwan book translated into cold beautiful images by the startling Joe Wright and scriptwriter Christopher Hampton. The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book. By the time the ""injustice"" takes place I was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by Knightley and McAvoy's liaison. Their love story is left to its own devices. The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, ""Pride and Prejudice"" keeps you going. The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see ""Atonement"" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations."

","Well, from the trailers I could tell this would be an epic film before I was even able to see it. I managed to attend a gala screening of the film last night and I thought it was amazing. Despite my constant dislike to Keira Knightly, I was unable to disapprove of her acting in this film. She has improved massively since the first pirates film. The film itself has an intriguing plot line which keeps you hooked throughout. The film includes humour at the start and fascination by the end. I loved watching this film and I enjoyed the smartness of the story. The film is cleverly done with jumps in time and different perspectives of events throughout which will leave you understanding the motives of each character more. The music is composed beautifully, the orchestral tunes accompanied with the clatter that a typewriter makes creates a beautiful piece of music that fits perfectly with the film itself. I have since begun to read the book, the only thing that the film lacks is the character depth that a book can write about but a film simply can't explain. I feel that the film shows what happened but the book is able to explain a little more as to why the events occurred. Overall the film was beautiful, brilliant and emotional."

","I finished filming as an extra in the blockbuster movie Atonement on August 22nd 2006. I didn't realise I'd have to wait a full 12 months and 1 day to see the end result on screen.<br/><br/>Well was it worth the wait? The answer is yes. The movie has the meticulous detail you would expect from a director of Joe Wright's calibre.<br/><br/>Richard Brooks (writing in the Sunday Times) said he would be amazed if the jury finds a better film than Atonement to take first place at the Venice film festival on August 29th.<br/><br/>He said, ""I cannot think of a better British movie in years. Unlike most of our home-grown efforts, it is big scale, yet intimate when it needs to be."" I would agree. The story unfolds and the audience is drawn into the plot from the start. It begins in pre-war England in a large country house with James McAvoy's character (Robbie Turner) being wrongly accused of rape and being imprisoned and thus separated from Keira Knightley. He is released from prison on condition he joins the army.<br/><br/>This is a love story and more, with the back drop of the Second World War. Although it is not a war film as such, the scenes of the Dunkirk evacuation are some of the best of their type ever executed in cinema history.<br/><br/>The scene that I was waiting to see was towards the end of the film. Joe Wright shot the Dunkirk scene in Redcar in one complete take, with no edits. It looks amazing, maybe being part of it made me slightly biased, but the human tableau that McAvoy's character walks through engulfs your senses and I can't wait to see it again. My only regret is that it wasn't longer.<br/><br/>Apart from this, Atonement doesn't disappoint in any department, the acting is first class and the story is engaging and I certainly didn't guess the ending. I will definitely see it again, this time at the Regent Cinema in Redcar, where the building is one of the cornerstones of the great set.<br/><br/>And finally did I see myself? Well possibly, the jury's still out, until I get my hands on the DVD next year. Enjoy it."

","When I watched this movie I never expected it to be that good, the movie has everything for you if you love romantic drama. Great acting by the actors , and the most amazing part is it's direction and cinematography, you will fall in love with the scenes. The plot is nostalgic set during the world war II, it's an exceptionally well drama. It's a must watch movie. James Macvoy has acted extremely good, all others actors are also fabulous and give justice to the novel. It's now my favourite melanchonic movie."

","I had been so excited to see Atonement since the first time I saw it advertised. Now that tonight I have finally been able to see it I have been left stunned, and now it is all I can think about. The romance between Cecelia and Robbie..is amazing, the chemistry that the two actors have together is captivating and every time they were together I felt pangs in my heart. The two younger actresses who play as Briony are amazing. As I live in Grimsby and I knew that one of the scenes is played in Grimsby I wanted to look out for it, but I was so captivated by the film that I completely forgot to look out for Grimsby. Though I would be glad to see it again, and this time I will try to tear my eyes away from the beauty of the scenery, and acting, and look out for Grimsby. Though this film is a 15 certificate, I begged my mum to buy me tickets, as I am only 14. All I can say is this film is beautiful, and will have you crying, I'm sure of it."
"Theo Robertson","6","32","52","27 December 2012"," The Language Of Cinema Can't Disguise A Problamatic Story
","When ATONEMENT was released in 2007 I made a point not seeing it due to the hype . Critics were falling over themselves to judge the film a "" masterpiece "" and it's interesting that all these critics were British . When it comes to harmless shallow jingoism the British film critics are unique . While some countries have an obscene tradition of murdering people because "" they're not one of us "" the British lovers of art fawn sycophantically over the slightest piece of mediocrity if there's some Anglo-Saxon Celtic connection and since ATONEMENT is set in a pre war 1930s Britain with posh folk we have the archetypal class driven British movie that appeals to jealous egalitarian Americans . It was interesting that the film didn't do very well at the American box office and that despite receiving an avalanche of prestigious nominations it had a very small award from nomination ratio . This tells you something <br/><br/>After seeing it after the hype has been dead for several years my impression of it is that on a technical level it is a very impressive film . From the opening scene which involves both sound editing and imaginative camera work there's a lot to impress cinephiles . Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the cinematography by Seamus McGarvey . The way the colours contrast and seduce the audience with an on screen beauty is worthy of the best works of the great Roger Deakins . There's also a scene set on the beaches of Dunkirk where the camera floats around for ten minutes never cutting once which has entered in to legend . One wonders why director Joe Wright wasn't Oscar nominated for this scene alone . Perhaps he was trying too hard to impress ?<br/><br/>Unfortunately perhaps it was down to some very clumsy errors on the part of the director that he didn't receive more . As was pointed out at the time the story takes place in 1935 then jumps forward with a caption saying "" Four Years Later "" with the evacuation of Dunkirk which in fact took place in May -June 1940 which every schoolboy of the 1970s would know . This caption can't be defended down to the early segment taking place at the end of 1935 because it's obvious the way people are dressed that it's Summer 1935 . Other irritants involve a Lancaster bomber flying around the skies of 1935 England and a black cockney corporal in the BEF . It's not impossible to have a black cockney in the British army of that time , just unlikely . What would be impossible would be Corporal Mace to be overweight as seen here . Rationing had been introduced and there was little fat in the British diet in those days . Hands up anyone who has seen a photo of a fat person circa 1940 ? Thought not <br/><br/>These irritants might be forgivable but one thing that is fundamentally flawed comes from Ian McEwans source novel . Robbie is found guilty of child rape and sentenced to several years in prison . When he is in Northern France he states that he was given a choice to either serve in the army or complete his sentence . In reality this wouldn't have happened in real life since conscription didn't extend to prisoners serving sentences . This becames even more unlikely when we're shown a segment set "" Six Months Earlier "" which would place that event round about Nov/Dec 1939 when Robbie has completed basic training . The truth is for Robbie to have completed basic training he'd have needed to join the army before conscription was introduced in the Autumn of 1939 . Before that the British army was an all voluntarily professional army . This fact makes it doubly implausible for a convicted child rapist to be given a choice between serving a sentence and serving in the military <br/><br/>As the title suggests ATONEMENT is a redemption plot but seems poorly translated to screen . The film ends with Briony Tallis on contemporary TV plugging her latest book called Atonement ( Oh Meta-fiction . How wonderfully clever - not ) and stating that the scenes she wrote where she finds a reconcilation between herself on one side and Robbie and Cecillia on the other is total fiction since Robbie died on the beaches of France and Cecillia died in an air raid a few months later . This might have worked on the printed page but comes across as problematic on screen. Put it like this if Robbie was having a death dream that wouldn't be as confusing as what is seen here and you feel somewhat cheated by the way events happen . It's not helped by the fact Briony is a compulsive liar who ruined someone's life . The fact she grew up to be a major successful novelist who will die of old age is another factor that will alienate. Some people are beyond redemption and atonement in its literal ecclesiastical meaning is nonsense to any humanist <br/><br/>In all you can understand to a large degree the number of plaudits and prestigious nominations this film received on its release . It is a visual delight for those of us who understand the language of cinema . Conversely you're also to understand why it wasn't able to convert the acclaim in to actual awards . It is very problematic from a narrative point of view and for a film to achieve true greatness you must find some empathy for the protagonists and empathy is in short supply for this film with its clumsy storytelling and characters"
"RockStrongo","1","88","158","6 September 2009"," The Most Overrated Film Of The Last Decade.
","I cannot adequately sum up into words the disappointment I felt after watching this film.<br/><br/>England 1935, and 13 year old Briony Tallis thinks there's something funny going on between her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightly) and their strapping gardener Robbie (James McAvoy). She totally misinterprets several events that take place over the course of a day, and as a result Robbie is sent to prison. Five years later, With Britain at war, Robbie is in the army fighting at Dunkirk. Will he return to Cecelia? Will Briony put things right? Unfortunately, at this point I was past caring. <br/><br/>So what was wrong? For a start, the performances were awful - the idea seems to have been 'why act when you can overact?'. The direction was slow and ponderous. The characters were vacuous and two-dimensional.<br/><br/>I counted half-a-dozen or so scenes that could (and should) have been left on the cutting room floor, they seemed to have no point at all, weren't explained properly, nor did they lead anywhere. I suspect they were only left in to bring the film up to a two-hour running time<br/><br/>Then there were the continuity errors: A Lancaster bomber flying in 1935, six years before they were invented; Robbie losing his boots in one scene, only to be wearing them again in the next; Briony seeing Robbie and Cecilia through the open library door when they clearly closed it behind them when they went in; Briony saying that these events happened when she was 10 or 11, then later in the film saying they happened when she was 13; Robbie's letters, appearing and disappearing on his desk depending on the camera angle...And how deep was the water supposed to be in that garden fountain????? <br/><br/>Worst of all though, was the clumsy and contrived way the 'misunderstandings' were set up. I'm no dramatist, but I could see every one of them coming a mile off.<br/><br/>I'm sure the film-makers would say their film was poetic in its nature, not meant to be taken literally, but that is no excuse; Ed Wood and David Winters said the same about their movies. It also makes no sense for Briony to state at the end that she was telling 'whole truth, without embellishment' when the story is filled with embellishment from the very first scene.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I'd like to hear Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy do a riff on this movie. Perhaps I'll e-mail them...."
"LeFreak-5","1","64","112","21 March 2008"," I just didn't care!
","The tragedy and poignancy of this wartime love story should've torn my sentimental heart out. But I found I was checking my watch repeatedly during the last hour since I figured out by then that nothing much of great cinematic significance was going to happen.<br/><br/>A privileged and obnoxious precocious rich girl makes a false allegation regarding a decent and mildly likable working class man, and she is believed by virtue of her station in life, effectively ruining his life. This may make some deep statement about the entrenched class system in Britain, but this interesting point is never developed in favour of shallow Harlequin romance sappiness.<br/><br/>I just didn't given a damn about anyone in this movie. Keira Knightley, despite her striking physical beauty, remains just as aloof and unlikeable here as in her incarnations of Elizabeth Swan and Elizabeth Bennett. And I expected I would identify more with McAvoy's character, as many if not most men hugely fear being misunderstood in relationships and thus vulnerable to vexatious allegations of sexual impropriety. But I found so little endearing in him--he by no means impressed me as the quintessential romantic hero who I wanted to get the girl despite ostensibly insurmountable obstacles.<br/><br/>The Vanessa-Redgrave-as-Briony revelation at the end of the film was a mildly entertaining ""twist"", but still the fact that Robbie and Cecilia were casualties of the war before they could be reunited did not move me much at all.<br/><br/>In short, it ain't Casablanca. The star-crossed-lovers-in-wartime thing has been done before Atonement. And it has been done better.<br/><br/>Despite the invective of another review, I am very attentive to film music and I really liked the score. The incorporation of an old typewriter as a percussion instrument at points was striking and original and I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The film really deserves a 6 (mildly entertaining and not a complete waste of time), but I give it a 1 in my attempts to offset the abundance of pathetically misguided reviews that are claiming to find cinematic genius here."
"ewan-59","1","108","197","22 February 2008"," Talk about overrated
","With so many people raving about how incredible this film was I went to see it with high expectations. I wish I had not bothered. To call it over rated would be an understatement.<br/><br/>To start with why are we so obsessed with class war in this country. NOT every single person from the aristocracy was a bigoted upper class twit. We won two World War with a military led by people from those classes so they could not all have been bad. (And NO they were not all poetry writing closet homosexuals either - see most First World War offerings). Yes there were some snotty idiots but to brand everyone as such would be like labelling every working class person as a foul mouthed yob/football hooligan. This whole subject is getting so utterly boring.<br/><br/>From a historical perspective 'Atonement' leaves a lot to be desired. About halfway through the film we see a Lancaster fly overhead. The prototype of this aircraft did not fly until 1941, NOT the mid 1930s.<br/><br/>Next we move to Dunkirk, where they got the date wrong. Dunkirk was 1940. At one point during the retreat to Dunkirk James McAvoy and some fellow soldiers are seen spending the night in an abandoned building. (This is over a lit candle on a dry wooden floor covered with combustible material......nice one guys). These men are alarmed by the arrival of some French civilians bringing food as they initially thought they were Germans. If James McAvoy and friends were that worried about Germans why did they not post a sentry and blanket out the windows??? As a soldier let alone an infantryman one of the first things you are taught in training is the importance of posting sentries and basic noise and light discipline!!! <br/><br/>The scenes of Dunkirk beach were for me the final straw. Whoever designed the set not only tried to cram far too much in, but has clearly never served in the armed forces. Amongst the biggest howlers were the anti aircraft guns that were too close together with no attempt made to protect them or their crews. This is at a time when the Dunkirk beaches were being hammered daily by German aircraft, especially the dreaded Stuka dive bomber. Secondly the soldier siting the Vickers machine gun has not only made no attempt to conceal his position, (why not use one of the buildings) but if he had ever fired the weapon from that position he would have only hit his own men.<br/><br/>Finally, where on earth did the black guy come from? People may argue symbolism, (which can go quite well with accuracy) but in reality there were no British African Regiments at Dunkirk. The Kings African Rifles, the Nigeria Regiment and other African units did fight with distinction in WWII but this was later on and in Africa the Middle East and Burma NOT Dunkirk in 1940.<br/><br/>If there was an award for most overrated film of the year 'Atonement' would be a clear winner. If you like historically inaccurate drippy yarns about injustice and class war you will love it. If you do know something about history or have served in the military you will be biting a large hole in your lip. How this film won the BAFTA's best film of the year over other films such as 'The Lives of Others' is a mystery."

Oh, please.....The whole war footage was utterly confusing, and especially in the part of the cockney soldier, which is oddly funny. (Was that on purpose? If so, how very strange, if not, how very unfortunate). The ending, which just sort of suddenly lurches forward into present day, (lord, why did that poor Briony NEVER change her hairstyle?) is a huge bait & switch which cannot help but make you think that you've wasted two hours, essentially by being lied to.

"Fred-S","1","87","161","25 April 2008"," I will tell you exactly why this movie is painfully bad...
","I will not say that this is a really bad movie because a lot of people think it is really good and, unlike some others, I am not arrogant enough to think that my taste should set the standard for everyone else. There is no accounting for taste, even bad taste.<br/><br/>However, I thought it was a painfully bad movie and I will tell you very specifically why.<br/><br/>First, some specific things that prevented a knowledgeable viewer from sympathizing with the characters.<br/><br/>1. In the promo they say that a young girl sees something she doesn't understand and mistakenly tells a story that that has tragic consequences. That entire sentence isn't a quote, but ""something she doesn't understand"" is. In fact, she sees several things and she does understand enough to know what is going on. The specific event that tops off the sequence of events that ruin lives is one she knowingly lies about whether or not she fully understands it, and she clearly has set out to destroy a man's life (apparently motivated by jealousy). Even before the ""main event,"" she says that he should be put away where he can hurt no one. <br/><br/>2. It is said in one of the promo trailers (no spoiler here) that Robbie had the choice between prison and going to war. Well, this was a part of WWII that most Americans don't know about because America hadn't entered it at that time, but all able-bodied men in the UK went to war. <br/><br/>3. The scene in the library was absurd. To disrespect one's family by doing something like that in a library with a horde of people wandering around would have been the height of disrespect and stupidity. <br/><br/>4. In the 1930's in Britain (or America for that matter), if a father caught his daughter engaged in (or learned of) the acts that actually did occur the boy would find going to prison to be one of the nicer things that might happen to him.<br/><br/>Now, about the structure of the movie:<br/><br/>The story has a beginning and an end. Most of the story should have taken place in a middle that does not exist in the movie. There are events with major consequences for all involved: the girl (Briony), Cecelia, Robbie, the Tallis, Quincy, and Turner families, as well as others. These events take place in the beginning of the story: And the consequences? We learn nothing of what happened except a little of Briony, that Robbie chose war, and that Cecelia stayed around, possibly waiting for Robbie  or possibly not, as we learn near the end of the film. The middle of the story is related in a few sentences.<br/><br/>The end of the film is supposed to show the ""atonement"". Presumably, this is Briony's atonement for ruining a few lives  we don't know how many because that would have occurred in the middle of the story. Atonement is ""satisfaction given for wrongdoing."" Unless one includes satisfaction obtained by the wrongdoer, which I don't think counts, there is no atonement.<br/><br/>So, what does one have? Some very unlikable characters, some of whom have bad things happen to them because of bad things done by other unlikable characters. The few likable characters disappear during the non-existent middle of the story.<br/><br/>If you choose to see this movie you may very well find something to like, but I don't think it will be anything that is a part of the story."
"oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx","6","89","168","11 October 2007"," Patchy and probably underdeveloped
","I went to see this film last night. I had high expectations because it has received an extremely high vote average on the IMDb. Coupled to that I have read a couple of Ian McEwan novels, The Cement Garden, and The Comfort of Strangers. Both novels are exquisite, and McEwan is a total master of fiction. The Comfort of Strangers was a bruising read and The Cement Garden was incredibly trenchant and reminded me of my own upbringing. <br/><br/>So I had some doubts about whether his intensity could be brought to screen (although the film of Cement Garden is rather good). I did actually groan when I saw in the first credits that the film was a Working Title production, because although I know they have a good reputation, generally speaking I hate their stuff. Far too glossy and bland.<br/><br/>The first shot was very promising, a dolls house trompe a l'oeil and exquisitely arranged toys. The Camera pans from the house to the troupe of toy soldiers and plastic bestiary, which taper towards a desk where we see the precocious stripling Briony typing out the last words of her first play. The uncanny organisation of the toys is a powerful indication of the girl's state of mind: both fanciful and controlling. A coup de maitre worthy of McEwan. Then there is a soundtrack where the main instrument is a typewriter. A very bold strategem indeed as in my opinion cinema needs to distance itself from literature, but entirely successful.<br/><br/>From there the level of directorial virtuosity declines rather rapidly, we see that a vat of money is used to substitute for creativity, and the audience is meant to be wowed by painstaking and yet quite beside-the-point recreations of scenes from the war. We've had all this with Gangs of New York, Saving Private Ryan, and other tepid 'masterpieces' ad infinitum. <br/><br/>Having said that there is actually a continuous shot of Dunkirk in this film which lasts five minutes that I know will have even the most cynical of film watchers drooling. It is as a character says like a scene from the Bible, I have seen a similar looking Breughel print. <br/><br/>However the film is meant to be a love story, and by God, it does not convince me as one. The love between Cecilia and Robbie is not properly established, and most of the other characters are cardboard cut-outs. I felt the film could have been a lot longer to enable some character development. The only fully fledged character is Briony. How I long for the days of Billy Wilder who established the journalistic character of Chuck Tatum in Ace in the Hole simply by having him strike a match on a typewriter in a very practised manner.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes in France during the fighting I am sure would work better in the novel, in the film they are really a bit devoid of context. Finally the end of the film is a conceit that really failed to impress me, and I won't give it away but the atonement strikes me as very hollow. <br/><br/>I think this movie tries very hard to be an epic after the fashion of The English Patient, unfortunately it becomes rather tired and generic. Having said that the source material is of such a quality and the amount of money spent seemingly so vast that the film is very enjoyable. But nowhere near a masterpiece."
"clivy","5","35","62","8 September 2007"," admirable attempt at filming a novel about writing but ultimately disappointing
","I taught Ian McEwan's novel as part of university courses in contemporary British fiction, so I felt differently about the film than my husband did -- my husband saw the movie without having read the book. I think ""Atonement"" is a valid and admirable attempt at filming a novel about writing. The use of the sounds of typewriter keys strongly conveyed Briony's development as a writer and the power of her testimony to destroy, the power of Robbie's passion to move Cecilia and shock Briony and her family's world, and the power of the mature Briony to enable Robbie and Cecilia to have in fiction the happiness that they could not have in life. My husband debated with me whether Briony's fiction can really give her sister and friend the life that her testimony took away from them, or whether the atonement is only in Briony's mind. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is superb: until I saw the credits I believed the 18 year old Briony was played by the same actress as the 13 year old Briony. However, the ending and the mature Briony's admission that she invented scenes in her supposed true account are unconvincing. Briony's interior life and her realization that other people are as alive and important as herself are not shown on screen. The shifts in time may be confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the novel. Both my husband and I found the movie slow and some of the scenes overlong, especially the scenes of Dunkirk. I wondered if the director lingered on them to show off the expensive shots of the thousands of extras. Ultimately it may be impossible to portray in a film many of the aspects of McEwan's novel, especially Briony's stories suggesting not only her own moral and professional growth but the growth of fiction throughout the last century. ""Atonement"" keeps most of the spirit of McEwan's novel until the closing scenes. Aside from the hurried coda, we both thought it was too sentimental and clichéd not only to close with a sequence of Robbie and Cecilia frolicking on the beach in front of the cottage they never shared in true life, but to set the cottage in front of the white cliffs of Dover."

","This movie was an incredible waste of time, money, and gas. I went in expecting a beautiful, profound movie and left angry and disappointed. The film began with great potential but after about 45 minutes it plummets into an unbelievable, superficial and contrived story. How could Briony think that writing a happy ending for Cecilia and Robbie is any kind of Atonement? I would have liked the film better if Briony finally killed herself. It was so much like Titanic, technically amazing with an awfully cliché story.<br/><br/>I'm shocked and annoyed that it was nominated for anything and that it won a Golden Globe. If it wins the Oscar, I will never trust the Academy again."

","At a gathering in a country house a jealous little girl meddles in her sister's love life, and things will never be the same ...<br/><br/>From an interesting novel that had an engrossing first half but, for me, trailed off in the second. So I had a different experience with the film adaptation, where the country house scenes are not quite satisfying but the following war story is brilliantly told. The narrator is a fascinating little character, but looking back I think her motivation needed to be colder and her atonement more problematic. In the end the story is wrapped up with a talking head, which I guess was unavoidable but not the mark of a great movie.<br/><br/>The long tracking shot on the beach at Dunkirk is amazing - not only a technical marvel (the amount of ground covered, the multiple interactions) but it creates a great sense of chaos and despair.<br/><br/>Performances are good, and it's no wonder people raved about Ronan. The music is excellent and plays about with the rhythm of a tapping type writer. Photography too, although I didn't get the sense of oppressive heat in the first act.<br/><br/>Overall: interesting and impressive, but some big flaws."

","In answer to the question as to whether Atonement could be adapted successfully for the screen; the answer has to be...almost, but not quite. McEwan's brilliant novel with its themes of redemption and morality could never transfer perfectly but writer Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright, give it a damn good try.<br/><br/>Starting in 1935 the film follows a doomed romance and how an over-imaginative girl's actions affect the lives of those around her. The film is stylish and intriguing, but, ultimately the novel's emotional gut-punch can't be delivered as successfully on film and its up to an uneasy coda to clarify everything for those who haven't read the novel.<br/><br/>Despite its limitations this is a very enjoyable film with some remarkable set-pieces and an intelligence that raises it above the run-of the-mill period romance film."

","Answer: Able-bodied Robbie would doubtless have found himself in the army anyway, and at the front even sooner. And that is what makes this contrived story ring so false-- that, and even worse stupidity:<br/><br/>The fact is, far from causing Robbie's death, the false testimony of young Briony would actually have saved his life if he'd opted to stay safely in prison, where he could have fought his conviction, perhaps even persuading her to recant after she had apparently matured into an empathic adult (she's a war nurse). Instead, he enlists in the army, only to croak at Dunkirk exactly one (one!) day before the evacuation, because god forbid this over-reaching melodrama leaves any tears unjerked.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, since Briony's sister Cecilia dies in the Blitz, it isn't as if sis and Robbie were going to be reunited anyway.<br/><br/>And another thing (I loathed this movie, are you getting that?): Maybe I missed it, but at any point does Briony attempt to clear Robbie's name? Her book doesn't--it's fiction, not memoir. To her way of thinking, of course, it's probably a question of, why bother since Robbie is so conveniently dead, and I'd be the only one who suffers.<br/><br/>Selfish and vain as a child, Briony is guilty of causing Robbie's imprisonment. But as bad as that misdeed was, it was the act of a juvenile and the tragedies that ensue have more to do with poor adult responses and a little thing called World War II than with a self-centered little girl. Her real sins-- the chronic faults she takes into adulthood-- are egocentricity and opportunism: She capitalizes on her juvenile lie by exploiting the story as a novel, yet again falsifying facts, this time to give the lovers a happy ending. It's SO much easier, after all, to apologize in fiction rather than in reality. She manages to keep the spotlight on herself throughout, of course, and eventually turns into Vanessa Redgrave on a book tour. The end. Thank god.<br/><br/>""Atonement""?

However my main gripe with the film is something else. When the one character that goes through the greatest amount of change remains off screen for most of the movie it doesn't leave room for engaging character development. In addition to this, to have the only actions on the part of that character turn out to be false results in us feeling that no change occurred whatsoever. ""But that is the point  she never had the courage"" I don't buy that and am certainly not impressed by the fact that I was told a lie. I felt cheated and let down as a viewer.

"imdb-5032","4","15","26","20 January 2008"," A beautifully rendered crocodile tear
","Despite excellent casting and powerful acting by lead actors Knightly and McAvoy, this movie is held back by bad direction and screenplay.<br/><br/>Many scenes drag on, seemingly without purpose, at the expense of detail and backstory. We get too little of the dreadful confectionery king Marshall (the perfect villain if ever there was one). We get nothing of Robbie's time in prison. We get almost nothing of Robbie's background and the class struggle.<br/><br/>The musical score, with the exception of a few golden moments (like the grandfather clock ticking in the background during the library scene), is overbearing and poorly directed, and after a while becomes frankly annoying.<br/><br/>The film's critical flaw however is that Briony is profoundly uninteresting. Her feelings are ersatz and officious, making her gestures meaningless. During Briony's confrontation with Cecile and Bobbie the film almost redeems itself by exposing Briony's childishness and the inadequacy of her remorse. Which could have been followed by an unadventurous but serviceable fade to black and drinks for the weary audience - many, many drinks.<br/><br/>Sadly that is not what happens. Instead, in a final outrageous act of betrayal, after what feels like hours and hours of agonizingly smeared out long shots, the viewer is summarily informed that the precious few scenes of dramatic interest were in fact figments of Briony's guilty imagination.<br/><br/>Then the movie wraps up with an embarrassing scene showing Robbie and Cecilia at the beach. This is Briony's fanciful way of saying sorry: a beautifully rendered crocodile tear."
"Turfseer","3","14","24","20 October 2008"," A Tale of Two Stories
","Atonement reminds me of Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" in that the director felt compelled to insert a 'second story' into the main narrative. In 'Gangs', there's a whole sequence about the New York Draft Riots which is completely superfluous, tacked on at the end simply because the director was enamored with a particular interesting piece of history. Similarly, in 'Atonement', we're treated to a glimpse of the British Army retreat at Dunkirk which is brilliantly photographed and reminds one of a scene from hell in a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Despite the Dunkirk scene's artfulness, it's all padding and it needs to be there because without it, 'Atonement' would be little more than a specious melodrama about the evils of the British aristocracy. <br/><br/>The first hour of Atonement is interminably long. The viewer soon discovers there's very little intellectual substance to this tawdry tale. In a nutshell, Briony, a 13 year old girl in an upper class family becomes jealous of her sister who has suddenly become intimate with Robbie, the housekeeper's son, who lives on their estate. Briony is the Brit version of the 'Bad Seed' but we never really find out what motivates her except for a schoolgirl crush and some unexplained revulsion toward adult sexuality (oh my, upper crust 13 year old snob is just so incredibly repulsed by witnessing her older sister and the housekeeper's son having sex in the library!!!). Speaking of that library scene, do you really believe that Cecilia and Robbie would have sex in the library where anyone could just walk in on them? And what about the crude note Robbie gives to Briony to give to her sister? If he loved her so much, why did he even think of writing that note in the first place and why would he entrust it to Briony (who he could have easily guessed would have looked at it?).<br/><br/>Worse than these plot contrivances, is the accusation of rape that lands Robbie in jail. Notice how Cecilia hardly sticks up for Robbie at all as he's hauled away by the police. Wouldn't she have put up a bigger fight or was the whole point that she was cowed by her snobby family? The 'investigation' into the rape lasts about 3 minutes on screen. In real life, many people would have been questioned and various suspects and angles would have been pursued. There's none of that here since 'Atonement' must fit the classic melodramatic mold--an innocent lover (victim Robbie) is broken by Bad Seed victimizer (Briony). At least there is an antagonist--for awhile--but Briony then disappears until the end of the movie, only to reappear (in the imagination) of a now elderly Briony who is working on her ""21st"" and ""last"" novel. The now reinvented Briony is a nurse (who opts not to go to Cambridge) and attempts to atone for her sins by throwing herself into the War effort. And the elderly Briony somehow 'atones' for her indiscretion by creating a fictional denouement: the 18 year old Briony apologizes to Robbie and allows the star-crossed lovers to live out their lives in a picture postcard world at the seashore (this clashes with the not so surprising true ending revealed to us by Briony the novelist that Robbie died at Dunkirk and her sister was killed during the Blitz).<br/><br/>Atonement gets high marks for atmosphere and mood. It has some very nifty cinematography and the music enhances the dramatic encounters. The characters here are one-dimensional in that the upper-class Brits are petty despots (the children reflect the parents' hostility) and the working class are hapless victims (exemplified by Robbie and his mother). Atonement becomes another movie in the second half and overall sports two antagonists. The Bad Seed is replaced by the horrors of war. 'Atonement' is an empty vessel. Don't be fooled by all the 'bells and whistles.'"

"bob the moo","Null","11","18","5 May 2008"," Professional and classy drama whose only significant weakness is the inability to deliver the emotional gutting that it should have been (MAJOR SPOILERS)
","As a thirteen year old girl, Briony Tallis has a passion and creativity that sees her channel her energy into writing novels and plays. Her upper class family live is happy and privileged. However a late night search for two of her young cousins who have gone off by themselves sees Briony stumble across her other young cousin being raped. Briony identifies the attacker as Robbie Turner, the young working class man taken in by her family who is also the new lover of elder sister Cecilia. In one night this accusation rips the family apart, shattering lives perhaps irreparably.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect from Atonement, never having read the book or really knowing much about the story. As a result I found the film to be a rather sumptuous and engaging watch but yet at the same time to be quite unsatisfying in regards the emotional content which I imagine the book must do much better. I imagine this for the simple reason that the film alludes to it and that the book has significantly more time to deliver in this regard. The thing for me is, and I'll jump right into the spoilers here, the film didn't develop and engage me enough for the story to hurt and the ending to crush. I didn't long for Robbie and Cecilia as much as I should have done and as a result I found myself watching the story rather than feeling it. The emotional impact of the ending is undercut by this as well. Without the hurt or anger in the viewer at the news that any happiness in their lives was a complete fantasy comes as a twist more than a punch. The presentation of this twist is also not perfect because for me it came over like it was giving Briony a way of finding her own forgiveness. It is a false atonement though and one given to her by herself to the benefit of nobody else. This sense of pointlessness and loss is not followed through on though and instead we get another ""false"" scene of happiness that seems to be suggesting that Briony has ultimately done the right thing; whereas I felt that she could never have atonement for what she did, whether I wanted her to or not.<br/><br/>I might be reading too much into it but that was what I thought and I didn't think that the film delivered that well enough. That said, the story is still engaging and solid. The jumping around within time structure worked surprisingly well and it did hold my interest easily. What makes the film though is the delivery, which is classy and professional in almost all regards. The sets and costumes hit you first because it is very well located and framed; you can feel the heat and relaxed air of the meadow, the stiffness of the dining room and so on. It looks and feels perfect for period and place; some will feel that that the typically English stiffness is a barrier to the film but I did not. The soundtrack is worth noting as well as it builds in the typewriter sound so well that it is present but yet unobtrusive. Wright's direction is excellent and the many touches he employs makes this stand out from being another English period piece. I liked the fades to black in the backgrounds and some other character framing shots that did keep the literary feel. Of course the money shot is the one-take around the crowded beach  an impressive shot from a technical point of view and a real pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The cast is the final area of delivery and of course the running time of the film and the requirements to hook the audience put a lot of pressure on them. I felt that McAvoy stood up to this pressure well and delivers a convincing and heartfelt performance throughout, making me care for his character. Knightley is not as good but she is not Pirates of the Caribbean either. I never felt for her or the pain she carries but yet at other times she is good  the love scene being the most convincing (and another really well delivered scene as well). Ronan is the best of the Briony actresses. I thought that Garai didn't give much away (partly because she is having to play a character as written by that character) and Redgrave, although a strong presence, was treated too well by the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall though this is a really well made film that has class dripping from the stylish direction, the score, the set and the performances to name a few. The emotional impact is surprisingly not what it should have been and I thought that the ending was disappointingly touched with hope and forgiveness that I thought was ill-fitting."
"ImCuredAlright","1","26","50","22 January 2008"," #1 on worst movies of all time
","I think if I hear one more comment about Atonement being an outstanding movie I might just hurl. Considering I saw comments before the movie saying things like ""One of the greatest love stories of all time"" and ""Heart-wrenching"" or ""A true master-piece"" I'll admit I was expecting something wonderful. My expectations were high, and I was very excited as I sat in the theater before the movie began. I had been told that it would be as good as The Notebook, and it would make me cry repeatedly. This just added to my anticipation. The movie started off slow. It was okay though, movies that I love have started off slow, so I was not going to be quick to judge. However, the movie continued for the next 45 minutes to be boring and quick frankly about nothing. As I looked around the theater I saw many people looking calmly at the screen or glancing around. A few even text messaging on their phones. It was an hour into the movie I decided I could not handle anymore and went to get a refill of popcorn. When I came back and asked what I had missed after being gone for about 10 minutes (I decided I needed to use the bathroom and make a phone call while I was out there) my friend stated ""uh well...nothing actually."" Wow I thought that is so surprising since so much has been happening this entire movie. When they movie finally and thankfully ended I sat there a little confused. I thought it was supposed to be a story about love. The love in Saw IV was greater. No looked sad as they walked out of the theater. No one looked thrilled after seeing such a marvelous movie. Everyone just walked out, and no one spoke. I finally reached my car and asked what everyone thought. The responses were all the same ""well it was okay I suppose...I mean it wasn't really about love or really about anything except war so..."". I would rather go and see Norbit 10 times in a row before I saw this movie again. If Atonement wins anymore awards or praise I am going to scream. I would recommend seeing anything but this movie if you have the choice."
"dfranzen70","2","34","68","11 January 2008"," Faceless, joyless, festival of dung
","Don't make the mistake of thinking that this movie is a twisty-curvy, tightly plotted suspense thriller on the order of Notes on a Scandal. Instead of a plot that takes plausible but largely unforeseeable left turns, Atonement's story is obvious, too blunt, and crackling with cliché. Everything, from the haphazard direction and editing to the numb acting, is a bit of an embarrassment to all involved.<br/><br/>Wildly overrated, Atonement is closer in style and scope to a Merchant-Ivory film, so if that's your cup of tea, you might like this one a little more than I did. But it's more like the dimwitted, held-back-in-school bastard child of such films, because although it contains all the proper hoity-toity attitude and pretty costumery, it has none of the subtlety or charm - in short, the characters are all largely unsympathetic, giving the audience no one to root for. This isn't always a deal breaker for me, but when the characters are dull, vapid, vacuous space takers, it does sort of put a damper on things.<br/><br/>At age 13, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) is a pretentious, self-possessed newbie writer. She's supposed to be a child prodigy of sorts, but she seems more perfunctory than imaginative (to be sure, we don't get much of a glimpse of her writing efforts at that age; it's merely implied how great she is). She harbors a crush on the handsome, strapping son (James McAvoy) of her wealthy family's housekeeper, who has long had eyes for Briony's older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). On a hot summer day, Briony illicitly reads a note from Robbie (McAvoy) intended for Cecilia (gasp) and then later sees something she shouldn't have. Subsequently the girl swears to seeing something she definitely didn't see, her perspective colored by her feelings for Robbie and her interception of the note. This irrevocably alters the lives of all three, of course.<br/><br/>The movie jumps around quite a bit, timewise, which at one point was an interesting approach to film-making but more often than not nowadays seems sort of played out and unnecessary; here it's done to confuse the audience a little bit, some trickery thrown in to distract from the fact that the plot itself is fairly bland and melodramatic. Because of Briony's misinterpretation, Robbie winds up in prison and later in the military, fighting in WW II. Much of the film describes his attempts to get back to London to be with Cecilia. Cecilia, meanwhile, works as a waitress - a job that's a bit lower than her family's station should allow. Briony forgoes attending an exclusive writing academy and becomes a nurse, all owing to her guilt (not to mention her obstinacy).<br/><br/>But what does it all mean? That one person's sworn testimony can screw up the lives of somewhat-innocent people? Oh, there's news. In the end, it all feels like much ado about nothing. Has Briony truly atoned for her sin? Of course not. She didn't have the guts to say anything when she had the power to do so; to make herself feel better, she writes a novel over the course of the rest of her life. So, no real atonement, just a general sense of comfort and insincere assuaging of guilt.<br/><br/>I think that's the crux of the issue here - the movie feels insincere. Are Robbie and Cecilia madly in love, or do they just want to have hot sex all the time? Little in the early half of the movie indicates the former, and plenty of evidence is shown for the latter. But even if they are in love well, here is where the issue of What the Movie Is crops up; this is not a psychological thriller, it's a dopey romance movie. It's a chick flick, even with some truly garish and probably unnecessary war scenes. (Do we really need to see burn victims? How does this further the plot?) The script is even based on a romance novel, by Ian McEwan. If pining for lost loves sounds like a grand old time to you, by all means dive into this murky, tortured movie.<br/><br/>As for the casting, it's not terrible. Knightley, who has said she wants to play more mature roles, continues to look like a tall, bug-eyed boy, with her shapeless, bony figure. She's not a bad actress, but she might have been a little in over her depth here; at no point did I feel sympathy toward Cecilia, although she's supposed to be a victim here. McAvoy (The Last King of Scotland) looks a little more girlish here than Knightley does, what with his impossibly red lips, even in the war scenes.<br/><br/>So. If you're expecting a thick-plotted, twisty thriller about what happens when a lie spirals out of control, this is not the movie for you; if you like costume dramas with actors rising to their material, this is also not the movie for you; if you like love stories with no apparent happy ending and actors sinking to melodramatic depths, this is a winner."

","The film is also technically superb. The cinematography is outstanding, with beautiful shot compositions on a hot summer's day to a war torn France. The most forefront achievement though is a scene that displays the English army's evacuation to Dunkirk. The scene (which lasts close to ten minutes) follows Robbie through an entire beach front filled with hundreds of soldiers, all of which is captured in a single shot. It is truly an achievement as the scene is both harrowing and mesmerizing. The musical score also deserves merits for its originality. Composed by Dario Marianelli, the music incorporates key sound effects (notably the type writer of Briony's) into musical themes. It really is rather clever works very well.<br/><br/>Even with all of its technical mastery (writing, music, editing, cinematography), the film's strongest assets are from its performers. The character of Briony, played by three actresses at different ages (Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave), is acted to near perfection. All three actresses (especially 13 year old Ronan) bring their A-game in represented a very complicated character. Keira Knightley though really finds a role to sink her teeth into as this is by far her best performance. Cecilia, who on paper may just seem like a supporting character, is taken to the level of leading lady by Miss Knightley. However, the film's strongest performance goes to James McAvoy as Robbie. Most film fans will recognize him as Mr. Tumnus from The Chronicles of Narnia, but here he gets to show how good he really is. His character of Robbie represents the best in human nature and will draw the strongest connection with audiences. McAvoy brings to him a sincerity that makes one of the strongest performances of the year. Mr. McAvoy is quickly on his way to stardom, and right so.<br/><br/>This is a film that really works on every level. The first act of the film is arguably the strongest. The scenes at the country house have a great sense of realism and honesty to them; you feel like you are there with the characters (very hard to do in a period piece). Joe Wright's masterful direction gives Atonement the sweep of an epic but the scope of a deep and personal character drama. It is a brilliant and moving story that will pull at your heart-strings and leave you shaken by its ending. Don't be surprised to hear its name a lot come Oscar time, it is the best of the year."

In the latter, one bit part actor after another was clearly waiting just off shot to do his bit.

I was sad during this film because it is a bad film. <br/><br/>so, if you liked ""Babel"" and ""Hard Candy"" then you should enjoy this film. If you don't like rubbish, then avoid this piece of trash with all of your powers."

","Crafted in Britain by director Joe Wright, Atonement tells the story of young author Briony Tallis who becomes jealous of her older sister's illicit love affair with a servant. And with this, she finds a love letter meant for Cecilia (her sister) written by the servant Robbie Turner and misconstrues it as a letter written with sadistic-perverted undertones when in reality it was a second draft that Robbie deemed to silly to use. Briony assumes that Robbie is a nymphomaniac and it is with this notion that she accuses Robbie with the rape of her younger sister. Upon hearing this, the Tallis family has him arrested and he ends up in World War II whilst Cecilia winds ups being a nurse. The rest of the movie revolves around Robbie trying to find his way back to Cecilia and also displays the cathartic process that Briony faces upon reaching adolescence and realizing the life-changing mistakes that she made. Atonement is sort of stuck in the middle in regards to whether it renders primarily on emotion or story. It is based on an Ian McEwen novel, so it does use some story elements in the latter segment of the film, such as when the story falls into the 'war-romance'-type category. The first half however feels highly eastern-oriented with well-placed shots around staircases and through windows that draw us into the secret love affair that Cecilia and Robbie have undertaken. The first part of the movie feels almost like a different film altogether. It feels quite artsy in spots and a lot of shots do not help to push the story forward. Having only seen two of Wright's films (Pride and Prejudice being the other) it's hard to lump his style into being specifically east or west. Pride and Prejudice had a lot of eastern elements in its use of detailed steady cam shots that follow its main characters around the sprawling English countryside. Atonement also has this, with an amazing 10-minute long steady cam shot that follows Robbie on a beach through the after effects of war. The shot is so magnificent that you forget about the lack of cutting and you start to feel as if you can taste the acrid flavor of rusted steel on a battleship or the stolid stench of soldiers' breath and spent bombs. The shot is very well choreographed as well as we see literally hundreds of extras that weave in and out of frame, each doing their own duty. Joe Wright uses background action nicely to tell different stories of different people without even giving them lines. Just watch the steady shot as it follows Robbie past a somber-looking band play a waltz or as he shoves into another soldier; a very well executed shot indeed. This shot does have an eastern-feel to it as it does not push the story forward but focuses on allowing the audience to see through the eyes of the main character. Editor Paul Tohill does a great job as well; his editing is never too fast paced but doesn't lag behind either. When he splices, he makes sure that we have enough time to fully incorporate ourselves within the basis of a shot. Again, his lack of editing in the steady camera scene helps to reinforce this. This can also be seen by assessing the scene that takes place near the end when Briony has come back to apologize to Cecilia and Robbie. His edits are now quick and slightly robust and help move the story along as we feel and see the tension-filled apartment room. The medium shot of Robbie when he almost decks Briony is tremendously powerful."

","""Atonement"" is a major achievement of the year, as it transforms the complex words of Ian McEwan's psychological novel into esthetic cinematic greatness, making us feel different feelings and ultimately creating three intriguing atmospheres, the first being an intricate portrait of the lives of a family, the second being an intense yet realistic look at war and the third showing us a flawed, selfish woman full of regret for the actions that she once committed and the causes that they committed in the lives of others. Whether these three atmospheres can differ in experimental styles, they are parallel to each other, allowing a certain rhythm to the story without being incoherent.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" begins with Briony Tallis writing ""The Trials of Arabella"" on her typing-machine. When she finishes writing it, she goes up and looks for her mom, while an intriguing score plays in the background (it is a mix of a haunting music with the sounds of her typing-machine marking the rhythm). This is how the tragic story begins. As this story advances, Briony witnesses the mysterious actions of Robbie Turner. She sees him making love with her confused and disorganized sister Cecilia. She then becomes witness of a horrible crime which she doesn't understand but she thinks she does, and falsely accuses Robbie Turner because of what he did earlier. Because of her interpretation of mature things, she separates Robbie and Cecilia. Robbie goes to war and Cecilia leaves the Tallis house and becomes a nurse, as she waits for her lover to be with her.<br/><br/>Christopher Hampton portrays a faithful adaptation of the picture's source material with his exquisite screenplay. The book has many segments of descriptions, mainly of the character's thoughts and feelings. It is a challenge to transform these thoughts and feelings into the cinematic language but Hampton managed to stay original by transforming them into images rather than going safe by making an omniscient narration. The book also shows the perspective of the three principal characters, and Hampton stayed true to this. He individually shows these perspectives instead of making an obvious omniscient view (some scenes are repeated so that the audience can observe the perception of every character).<br/><br/>Joe Wright, the director of the amusing though simple ""Pride & Prejudice"", outdoes himself with this motion picture. The directing is pretty much the most valuable aspect of this picture, as it conveys extraordinary executions of diverse feelings and of mood. There are many essential scenes were the directing is key, such as the smart sex scene. The shots are very detailed, showing the lips and body parts of the two principal characters and leaving us seduced. Another exhaustive scene is the long shot that follows Robbie Turner. This long shot creates a slow rhythm, as slow and tiresome as what Robbie is feeling. He is full of desperation, hunger and he is tired because of the war. This shot conveys these aspects without having to use dialogue to explain the situation of this character.<br/><br/>This picture also possesses some visually stunning images because of the complex cinematography and the detailed art direction. The set decoration of the aristocratic Tallis mansion is impeccable, as it is full of diverse colors and breathtaking British antiques which contrast with the pale colors of the French beach and the burned houses during the war. The cinematography is also impeccable. In the previously mentioned sex scene, the cinematography has to capture some very close shots of the different body parts of the characters and with very little light to maintain true to the mood that the scene must have. The scene is able to show us the impact that it was supposed to perceive.<br/><br/>The performances of the film are restrained but powerful. James McAvoy simply shines as Robbie Turner. He has a tough character development, as he has to bring a transformation to the screen, from being a seductive gardener who's finishing his studies to feeling physical pain because of war. He brings his character to life and his rage scenes portray the emotion that they were supposed to. Keira Knightley also plays a complex role. While some of her dialogue can be a little typical, such as the lines of ""I love you. I will wait for you"", she is still able to convey a confused character experiencing for the first time her sexuality and how this event becomes a true passion. Vanessa Redgrave was extraordinary in her final scene, playing the old and flawed Briony Tallis with remorse and full of demons, during her last days of life. She is the weight of the final scene and her revelation watered my eyes in the end.<br/><br/>While some persons usually complain because films aren't why they used to be, ""Atonement"" simply shows that true masterpieces with character development and extraordinary directing can still be made. It is a motion picture that touches many different aspects, from emotions to class, from passion to war. It shows literature with images and not with words and it conveys irresistible scenes with amazing execution."

","It isn't often that a film comes along and sweeps me away into a trance of beauty that lingers hours later like a delicate but potent perfume--that was the brilliant, epic film, Atonement.<br/><br/>We arrived at the theatre quite early as we usually do to claim our favorite seats, near the top and right on the aisle (I have to have an aisle seat because I have the bladder of a newborn baby). Being an independent movie I was somewhat surprised to see how full the place was filling up. I know that it has been critically acclaimed and has been nominated for a piles of awards but I still expected the theatre to be sparse do to the attraction of the National Treasure sequel. So I was surprised (and happy) to see so many people interested in an independent flick. But they kept piling in all the way until and into the previews. I haven't seen a theatre house that full since Titanic when we literally sat in the aisle to see it.<br/><br/>So, enough of my blathering--let's talk a bit about this visual masterpiece, shall we? Where to begin? Well, I've been thinking about what to say about a movie that blew my mind. It has taken me about 4 hours to put my brain back together again enough to write about this piece of art.<br/><br/>This film is really a like a three part play that grabs your attention in a shocking way and leads you down a tantalizing path of wonder, surprise, fear, anger, sadness and relief all the way to the credits. The dialog is minimal so much of the story is told through body language, cinematography and music. The cinematography is sweeping in capturing the grandeur of the scenes while maintaining focus on the main characters and important elements of the movie. The visuals were stunningly vivid and very memorable, even now as I'm typing I'm still going over these amazing images in my mind. The sets were meticulous in their authenticity and style. Yes, this movie was nothing less then poetry on film, watch for the Dunkirk scene in particular. It is no understatement to say that the visuals in this film swept you away and made you feel as if you were living the story with the characters. Each scene was a masterpiece in and of itself so that at the end of every one of them you feel the anticipation of reading the book and quickly turning the page to see what happens next. There were some very artsy long-shots in this film and they worked because of the detailed and awesome size of the sets.<br/><br/>The body language was intense, expressive and utterly human. Ascending star, James Mcavoy, who played Robbie was brilliant in his body language, you could really feel his restrained yet passionate nature. I didn't feel that Keira Kightley matched his energy but she gives a better performance here in this film then her dreadful performances in the Pirates franchise. This leads me to the young starlet, Saoirse Ronan who played a very complex, deeply dysfunctional character who felt more mature and intelligent then she actually was and learns a powerful lesson for it. Her facial expressions and intense eyes left an imprint on the memories of this movie that I'm recalling.<br/><br/>This brings us to the score, which stuck to a select few songs but it worked quite well as it kept with the films focused, intense mood. One song in particular acted like another character, a storyteller which arrived now and then to sweep us along to the next grandiose scene. It was subtle in its elegance but then not all that glitters is gold, sometimes the most beautiful thing is the one most over-looked by the majority--the cliché, ""diamond in the rough."" As you can tell I am wacko over this movie and give it a 10 out of 10. Seriously. If this one doesn't win the Oscar for Best Picture then it will be a tragedy. I can't recommend this one enough, unless you aren't into intense, subtle, artsy fartsy, complex love stories.<br/><br/>I think the thing that is sticking with me the most is that this movie reflects the strange reality that we as humans are fated to experience, and perhaps that is why I related to it so much. Unlike most movies, life is full of unexpected twists and turns and this movie captures that essence like no other that I've seen in a long, long time."

","After being one of the privileged few that got to see the movie at its gala performance last night (23rd Aug) & being an extra. I can recommend going to see this film when its out on general release. Both Keira Knightley & James McEvoy seem to bring the film to life both playing excellent roles. Well directed by Joe Wright as would be expected. Although the local scenes (redcar) are only a few minutes it really brought out the spirit of Dunkirk. It takes some following but if you've read the book by Ian McEwan it makes it much easier to follow. The 3 Briony's all play wonderful parts & the difference between the 2 younger actresses is difficult to spot. Vanessa Redgrave as usual finishes off the film wonderfully with a twist which isn't expected unless you've read the book. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did."

","What a disappointment - what was the point of it. All the characters were weak - and the choice of actors playing the parts did not help. Neither Keira Knightly nor James McEvoy had the stature to carry off their parts and neither could evoke any sympathy from the viewer. Briony came over as a spoilt brat - why did anyone believe her at all - and why was the aftermath of the accusation just glossed over. The gap between the incident and the next time you saw the ""heroes"" only served to confuse. One part of the film was a total farce - the scenes of the retreating soldiers in Dunkirt with the fair rides, singing soldiers in the bandstand, drunkenness and scenes of apparent total confusion are contrary to any historical fact - what point was the film trying to make here - was it some anti-war message - if so it was in bad taste."

","As Atonement opens with stunning images of the tranquil English countryside where everything is a picture of perfection and everyone appears content; you cannot help but feel the atmospheric foreboding as nothing perfect lasts forever in this tarnished world. Based on the bestselling novel by Ian McEwan, it is an unforgettable, beautifully haunting love story that slowly slips into a devastating flood of such raw, overwhelming tragedy that you can feel the emotional journey of the characters; and its' thought-provoking themes of forgiveness, atoning, betrayal, and love stay with you for days afterwards. <br/><br/>When Briony Tallis (played three different ages by by Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave) misinterprets an encounter between Robbie Turner (played by James McAvoy) and her sister Cecillia Tallis (played Keira Knightley), she tells a lie that carries such shocking consequences that it completely ruins their lives. Briony spends the rest of her life seeking forgiveness for her appalling act. The story is told against the backdrop of WWII from the three points of view, along with beautifully rendered and perfectly timed flashbacks and forwards. <br/><br/>Director Joe Wright does a splendid job contrasting the two worlds. The beginning is filled with whimsical, pastel colors of the exquisite English Countryside drenched in glowing sunshine where everything has the sense of a timeless perfection; only to be followed by the dark, ominous, gritty images of a war torn France. <br/><br/>The acting from the entire cast is top-notch. James McAvoy gives a strong emotion-filled performance of great depth; Keira Knightley effortless glides into her role as the high-class daughter, and as only she can do, speaks each line with such eloquence that it is a treat to just listen. Saoirse Ronan is truly one of the best child actresses of late as she acts with such a profound maturity and intensity; and Vanessa Redgrave is so perfect in her small role as Briony in her older years that she still manages to make an impression and is able to convey such emotion solely through her expressions. <br/><br/>Every level of production is so perfect, it is an absolute triumph. Notably the cinematography which was dazzling, containing one of the most epic and complex single-take in movie history (yes it even toped Children of Men); as well as Dario Marianelli's magnificent, sweeping score filled with an original theme of simple yet exquisite beauty. Atonement truly is the best film of 2007."

","Atonement (2007)<br/><br/>Top 10 - 2007 <br/><br/>Atonement has garnered considerable critical acclaim: 7 Academy Award nominations, 14 BAFTA nominations and won the Best Picture (Drama) at this years Golden Globes. The film will go on to win a number of accolades, some fully deserved, however, this is not the Best Picture of the year. Although this film had unlimited potential and it is beautifully translated onto the screen, I do not believe it extracted all the power and destructiveness of the love relationship present. Somehow at the end, I did not feel as sorry, as hurt and as saddened with the characters' ultimate fate as I could have been. However, heavily criticising this film, which is a remarkable achievement in storytelling, direction, editing, cinematography and even acting is highly unfair. <br/><br/>During the course of a few summer days at a mansion in the plush countryside of England, a tragic event occurs that causes irrevocable damage to the gardener of the estate (James McAvoy) and one of the daughters of the wealthy family who has fallen in love with him (Keira Knightley). After the rape of one of the little cousins during one night, Cecilia's little sister claims that it was Robbie (McAvoy) who had raped her cousins; her decisions having been fuelled by a coarse letter that Robbie accidentally sent to Cecilia and seeing her sister having sex with Robbie in the library. Of course it wasn't Robbie who raped Cecilia's little cousin, it was in fact her brother's wealthy friend (an owner of a chocolate factory). This event unsettles everything, when Robbie is sent to prison and later given the choice of entering the army to fight in France (at the beginning of WWII) and so the ultimately tragic course of the film begins.<br/><br/>Atonement is not a bad film. It deserves all its nominations and almost all its praise. However this beautiful, semi-melodramatic film is not this year's best film; not in a year with the Coens' 'No Country for Old Men' and Paul Thomas Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood'.<br/><br/>This film could have potentially been unsurpassed by any film this year, however, in my opinion the character relationships were not magnetic and compelling enough and at times I thought the film wondered slightly just to fill the time, for the expected (but still) powerful ending. <br/><br/>Some will undeniably feel more respect towards Joe Wright' fine film and some will definitely consider it this year's best film, all I have to say is that this is definitely a film that deserves to be watched, even if you are not fond of period epics, Atonement will not disappoint.<br/><br/>7/10"
"TheGOLDENWALRUS","9","5","7","30 January 2008"," That one shot
","That one shot seems to be the theme of the movie here as the young girl, Briony, accused Robbie of a crime he didn't commit. She had one shot to get it right but she was so jealous of her her sister Cecilia and Robbie as they had a secret relationship. Robbie was taken away from Cecilia and was off to the war.<br/><br/>The movie is shot from Briony's eyes as well as what really happened and it doesn't rely on twist to keep our attention even though the end did catch me off guard. It deserves its best picture nomination even though I can't believe James McAvoy didn't receive a best actor nomination (oscar) as he, Daniel Day Lewis and Viggo Mortensen were the ones that stand out to me so far this year. Of course Keira Knightly shined once again as so she did for Joe Wright's previous film, Pride and Prejudice. This film was absolutely beautiful with a rich score and very good direction by Wright who I will be following for now on.<br/><br/>Now for the most beautiful part of the film, the cinematography. Do you remember the incredible shots that Children of Men brought you? How they would stand out as four minute shots with no edits? This film has a five minute shot that I believe had no edits that just hurt with emotion. It was the most incredible shot I've seen this year and it completely caught me off guard. That one shot will haunt me. This film should win best cinematography and I will say it is easily one of my top three favorites so far of 2007. Don't miss this movie. It won't be forgotten! <br/><br/>Oh, and you'll only have one shot to see it in the theaters!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","7","26 December 2007"," McAvoy and Knightley are unlikely to win at Golden Globe because the real limelight is on one character played by three people, superbly
","With 7 Golden Globe nominations, ""Atonement"" is one of those movies for which the script is important. It is adapted from a novel by Ian McEwan, same as ""Enduring love"" (an impressive performance from Daniel Craig who, incidentally, was a relatively unknown at the time, at least on a global basis). Starting with an innovative use of the sound from a typewriter for percussion with a pulsating urgency, the movie plays out like a concerto with 3 movements.<br/><br/>The first part takes place in an ultra plush English country house set in the 1930s. While the backdrop is a typical upstairs-downstairs class-dominated environment, the mood is one of a dark psychological thriller. All the characters are presented here. While 13-year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) aspires to be a writer, her sister Cecilia (Kiera Knightley) and gardener's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) discover their deep mutual passion that had been bottled up in the last few years. The match is not as unlikely as it appears because Robbie, supported by Cecilia's generous father, is at least her academic, if not social, equal. Without getting into all the details of the other characters and plot, it suffices to say that Briony, driven by an adolescent passion for Robbie and a vicious jealousy that she is probably not fully aware of herself, accuses him falsely of a rape which she claims to have witnessed.<br/><br/>The middle movement sees a torturous journey of three English soldiers in France a few years later, winding up at Dunkirk. Robbie has been given a choice of staying in prison or going to the front. What we see is essentially his agonizing experience waiting for the Dunkirk retreat, with flashbacks of scenes with Cecilia as well as Briony.<br/><br/>The final movement is told from Briony's POV, when at 18 (Romola Garai), she has given up university to be a wartime nurse. This is the most intriguing part that is not unlike a coda on a theme of realty verses imagination brought out in the first movement. The last 10 minutes of the movie, with Vanessa Redgrave playing Briony in the final days, is a TV interview in which she appears mostly is a facial closeup.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully filmed, with an exquisite art-house flavour, from the dream-like elegance of the British country house to the brutal inferno of the Dunkirk beaches. Both James McAvoy and Keira Knightley got Golden Globe best acting nominations. But they are unlikely to win because the real limelight is on Briony  this is the story of her atonement. Saoirse Ronan got a Golden Globe best supporting nomination and is good enough to win. Romola Garai has taken her career one step forward from ""Scoop"", ""Amazing grace"" and ""Angel"". But it is Vanessa Redgrave's performance that takes the movie to a new height no one else today is able to. In those 10 minutes, we a privileged to a lifetime of excellence."
"bkoganbing","9","9","15","18 February 2008"," Telling A Vicious Tale
","Some of the best elements of Wuthering Heights and The Children's Hour are combined in Atonement to make a really fine romantic film. It's been nominated for several Oscars and is certain to take home something from this year's Academy Awards ceremony.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Keira Knightley are a pair of fateful lovers who novelist Ian McEwen no doubt was inspired by Charlotte Bronte. McAvoy is the son of the housekeeper and Knightley is to the manor born. They do so look like Heathcliff and Cathy as performed so many years ago by Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. <br/><br/>But they've got a young Mary Telford in their midst from The Children's Hour. Class distinction robbed Olivier and Oberon of earthly happiness, but in Atonement it's a terrible and vicious lie, told by a young girl with too vivid an imagination. <br/><br/>Saiorse Ronan plays Knightley's younger sister who tells the vicious tale. I can't recall another instance where a juvenile performer has been up for a Best Actress Award. Usually those are confined to the supporting categories. But young Ms. Ronan may just pull it off at this year's Oscar.<br/><br/>The main parts of the story take place in the United Kingdom from the late Stanley Baldwin years to the beginning years of World War II, of Dunkirk and the Blitz. Romola Garai does a fine job in portraying a slightly old version of Ronan's character. The sets and the cinematography showing the period have gotten deserved nominations.<br/><br/>The coda to the story is provided at the very end by Vanessa Redgrave in today's times. She's become a very successful novelist now and she brings the audience through a television interview the rest of the story. Her portrayal of a dying woman who now wants to make some amends is so moving I am mystified why the Academy voters overlooked her in the Supporting Actress category. There is no way anyone will leave the theater with a dry eye.<br/><br/>While it's still in theaters don't miss Atonement."

","I've just seen Atonement, and I'm still stunned. I cannot believe how fantastic that film was. I wanted it to go on and on, even though it was two hours long. When it got to the final scene, and the twist was revealed, I felt like I'd just got to know these characters, that I'd barely scratched the surface with them, and all too abruptly, the film had ended.<br/><br/>The story focuses on three inhabitants of an opulent 1930's home; the housekeeper's son (Robbie), his lover (Cecilia), and Cecilia's young sister Briony. When Briony reads a sexually explicit letter sent by Robbie to Cecilia (the words 'lick', 'wet' and the 'c' word are used) she labels Robbie a 'sex maniac', and when a young girl is raped on Briony's family estate, it is only too easy for Briony to convince herself that it was Robbie who forced himself upon her. The police believe her, and Robbie and Cecilia, who are deeply in love with one another, are torn apart, the course of their lives dramatically altering. Cecilia moves to London to become a nurse, vowing never to see Briony again, and Robbie is sent to fight in World War Two, with only the hope of seeing Cecilia again sustaining him. Briony, realising her mistake, must spend the rest of her life atoning for it.<br/><br/>Quite simply, if this film does not pick up the best film, director, actor, actress, supporting actress, editing, cinematography, soundtrack...the whole shebang, there's no justice in the world. I had such high hopes for this film, and they were all realised. It was so exquisitely beautiful but with an edge; shots of verdant French countryside overshadowed by planes, forests full of dead schoolgirls, blood-red poppies swaying in the wind as soldiers stride through them, and, in one of the most stunning pieces of film I've ever witnessed, a five minute tracking shot through Dunkirk, bypassing soldiers singing on a veranda, horses being killed so Germans may have no use of them, and fires springing from forlorn buildings, destroyed by relentless bombing. It's an incredible scene.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is stunning. His performance is so powerful and moving. He seems to convey everything through a glance, a movement of his hand, a tremble in his voice. There are so many standout scenes with him at its heart, but my personal favourite would be the one where tears slide silently down his face as the camera pans back, revealing children whose bodies bare the unmistakable marks of gunfire. He gives a tour de force, and while every actor delivers a near faultless performance, his weary face and tortured eyes are as powerfully moving as anything you will see this year.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is brilliant as the upper-class stiff whose devoted love for James McAvoy's Robbie makes her abandon her family. And Romola Garai and Saoirse Ronan, who play the same characters, are remarkable, especially 13 year old Ronan. She's a revelation as Briony, playing her with snotty, pretentious relish.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film enough to you. Every single frame is fantastic, and if I were to attempt to list my favourite scenes, I'd ended up writing the whole movie. As I can't do that, however, I will pick two: the scene towards the end where Robbie confronts Briony about what she'd done, his anger reverberating around the room as she cowers in the corner, terrified he will strike her, I loved. The emotions were superbly played, particularly by McAvoy. The death scene at the end was heartbreaking. My mother never cries. In fact, I've seen her cry just once in fifteen years, but even she was weeping. The cinema was absolutely packed and I couldn't express my grief, so I stuffed my fist into my mouth to stop myself from howling. My face was soaked with tears and I couldn't stop shaking with the weight of them. I never even cried that much at Titanic or Green Mile. In fact, the whole of my row (and the row behind and in front) were crying too, from what I could hear. There were loud sniffles and choking sounds from all over the theatre. The person next to me swore when the twist was revealed and then burst into tears. The way they did it was so moving. How the picture of the cottage that Robbie and Cecilia had promised to stay at when the war ended was clutched in Robbie's hand when he died. How Cecilia was seen floating beneath the underground, drowned when a bomb exploded the waterworks. When you realise that every scene post-Dunkirk including Robbie and Cecilia never happened, because they were both dead. There are huge pangs in my stomach, now, just thinking about it and the tears are rolling down my face! I knew Robbie was dead, anyway, or dying at least. There are hints dropped throughout the film, like when he opens his jacket and reveals an infected shrapnel wound; when he sees his mother in a hazy sequence that is clearly him becoming feverish; when his friend lies him down, tucks Cecilia's letters next to him, and hushes him because his shouting's waking everyone up  and how Robbie promises to be quiet. I'm remembering little bits now, like Cecilia's letters floating in the sea, and Robbie dying several hours before the British were rescued and evacuated out of Dunkirk. I also loved 13 year old Briony in the pool, asking Robbie if he would save her if she fell in, and then proceeding to do just that to see if he would, and the older Briony, comforting a delirious, dying French soldier at a hospital.<br/><br/>This film is absolutely brilliant. I loved everything about it, apart from the fact it's not longer. There's a wonderful dreamy quality to it but the performances are earth-shatteringly real. Joe Wright's served up another triumph, in only his second foray into film directing."

","I would Like to start of by saying that generally period dramas aren't my thing, i get very quickly bored with them and tend to switch of within the first minutes of watching. Much the same with Atonement i had low expectations from the start, luckily for me my brother convinced me to carry on watching. The film i saw then has changed the way i see such films, never again will i write off a film because it looks 'boring'.<br/><br/>It is hard to know where to start with a film such as this as nothing really stands out, instead it is all perfect. The logical way to start would be to describe the story line, yet it is also hard to do that as it is hard to know how without ruining the film or making it seem 'boring'. Instead i will say that it is something that needs to be seen.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent with Keira Knightley and James McAvoy giving what only can be described as the performances of their respective careers. In addition Saoirse Ronan (who plays the 13 year old Briony) is the most promising child actor since Dakota Fanning.<br/><br/>However it was not only Saoirse Ronan who showed true promise in this film. Atonement has also brought to my attention the promising talents of director David Wright who up until now was unknown to me, (having only made pride and prejudice) and undeservedly so. His direction was amazing, especially in the scenes in France which somehow managed to portray the true horror of war without showing the slightest of conflict.<br/><br/>Their is one problem with this film however and that is that their is nothing bad about it. This may sound a bit strange but i always like to have a rant about something that annoyed me about a film(such as plot holes or bad characterisation), but for Atonement their is nothing. I could say i feel cheated by the ending which does make you question the film slightly, but that would not be true because it is so well done that they could have all turned out to be aliens in the end and i would still have enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Finally i have only one thing to say to people who haven't seen this film yet.Watch it.

","A testament of the power of word, this movie has a poetic aura that makes it impressive.A kid, Briony, mistaking her older sister's love for a house servant for abuse against her makes a terrible revelation that will haunt the three people's lives forever.<br/><br/>What impressed me mostly about this picture was it's flow.Expanding over six years this movie has no gaps and the story proceeds nicely.I have not read the book but here everything is put in a magnificent order.The flash-backs that initially follow after Briony watches something disturbing work amazingly, we always believe that she has watched something bad only to be wronged when we observe the whole picture.There is no time-killing,either. Everything here has a reason and all the moments of the film contribute to it's climax, contrary to modern block-busters that tend to spend time over trivial scenes almost nothing can be omitted here. The passage from the Manor's scenes to Dunkerke and is set down nicely and the story maintains it's focus. The ending of the film is strong and ties the whole movie.It is after all a story praising the power of the expression and it begins as it ended with a tribute to the written word.<br/><br/>The actors are also phenomenal. Knightley shines in the role of Cecilia, a bold albeit rough woman. Saoirse Ronan, the 13 year old Talis is also stellar with a clear expression and attitude so rarely seen in kid's roles today. James McAvoy is also pretty good. Vanessa Redgrave's minor part also has a great significance to the story serving as the emotional climax.In all, this is an excellent film, maybe one of the greatest this decade has to offer."
"sobeit712","1","23","47","24 February 2008"," Meaningless, purposeless and utterly ridiculous
","The whole story evolves around a freakish petty little lie of a jealous, cowardly and spoiled 13 year old girl that costed 2 people's happiness. The end. I'm not sure if I'm watching the same movie that got everybody praising about. There's no bigger meaning, no redemption, no resolution, no moral high ground and certainly no atonement! Instead, it made me feel rather cheap and ridiculous. The character is rather spiteful and cowardly as she eventually admitted in the end.<br/><br/>I really don't mind watching a movie that reveals the ugly side of humanity, as long as it's done in a honest and proper way. The problem with this movie is that the story and character is so petty, but the music score and cinemaphotography makes you feel like you are watching an epic tale. It ended up rather strange and disconnected.<br/><br/>It is the epitome of English hypocrisy: Petty, dishonest, self indulgent and meaningless. The whole thing has nothing to do with the Second world war. It was thrown in there in a desperate attempt to rub a little bit meaningfulness off the war. But since the premise is so petty, ugly, meaningless and unnecessary, it appears rather awkward. Everything is cheapened, incuding the war. I would rather go to the extend that it perverted the sacrifice of those who died fighthing the war. Remember, the whole story centers around a jealous 13 year old girl who try to destroy the man she couldn't get because he loves her sister. It is eventually a rather perverted little drama that built off such petty intention. It never reached any moral high ground."

","I decided to see Atonement when I saw its trailer: nice shots, life in England just before WW2, an interesting human drama, etc. I began to worry a little bit when I heard a critic say that ""it is in The English Patient territory"" - a film I deeply disliked - and worried even more when I read comments saying that Atonement would be a strong candidate for an Oscar, since Oscars are awards given on the basis of the commercial success of films, instead of their artistic merits.<br/><br/>My worst fears were confirmed: Atonement is a pretentious but ultimately vacuous film. It reminded me of that famous line, ""he didn't say anything, but he said it so beautifully!"". It is very well shot, the actors are decent - if a little bit wooden - the locations magnificent and its basic plot is fine. But it never involves you. I found myself yawning, making shopping lists in my head and wondering what time it was.<br/><br/>The plot? Without giving away anything important (not that there is anything much to give away) the film turns around a13-year old girl who, through a mixture of naiveté and jealousy ruins the life of a young man and many years later tries to make amends for it. It takes place in the late 30s and the 13-year old girl is one of the daughters of an upper middle class, wealthy family: beautiful country house, gardens, servants, the whole British cliché. The boy whose life is ruined is the son of one of the caretakers, but he's been taken under the wing of the family, has gone to good schools and is planning to study medicine at Cambridge, which means he knows how to wear a dinner jacket (when he's not carrying suitcases for weekend visitors).<br/><br/>The problem is that the movie tries to be ""arty"" while having mass appeal. It uses quite a few fashionable tricks, such as an unorthodox sound track (lots of typing noises), high volume sound effects and long, ""artistic"" tracking shots. It never manages to involve spectators in the events that it describes and, ultimately, it's but a pretentious and shallow attempt to describe the way some people lived in England at the time. Uninteresting, boring and fake. Or, to quote the classics, ""much ado about nothing""."

","As a huge fan of Ian McEwan's novel, I was originally anxious as to how any film could accurately portray it, and not a little jealous as I had decided it my destiny to write the screenplay. However, Joe Wright exceeded my already reasonably high expectations (he did well on Pride and Prejudice) and delivered a masterpiece. Briony, a 13-year old girl, has an extremely fertile imagination, and has been writing stories from a very young age. At the beginning of the film, she has just completed her first play, and is learning the difficulties that follow this, i.e., actor trouble and worries about rehearsals. It is clear early on that Briony has slightly egocentric tendencies. For one, all her toy animals face her writing desk, where she is usually to be found. So when her older Cecelia and her friend Robbie finally start their long anticipated relationship, Briony has misinterpreted the signals that led to it, and believes Cecelia to be the victim of a predator. And so she tells a lie that will ruin the couple's chance of happiness. Years later, Robbie has been sent off to war, Cecelia is a nurse, and Briony a trainee nurse, trying to atone for what she did four years ago. We have star acting from all of the main cast, and to be honest, I really loved Robbie's army buddy, whose final line finally brought out my long held back tears. Keira Knightly looked lovely, and has finally moved on from coming-of-age roles to Woman, and may I say she does it beautifully! All three actresses who played Briony did so just right for her age, especially Vanessa Redgrave. James McAvoy, however, delivered a stunning performance- from quite comic humour as he realises a rather embarrassing letter mix-up to seething with anger as he shouts at a humbled Briony. Atonement has already been predicted as a huge Oscar winner, and I can definitely back that.I would definitely recommend this film and give it ten stars."

","The trailer for Atonement had me giddy with excitement I thought I was going to be in for a truly epic love story that spanned time, distance, war, betrayal, but what I got was this anemic, pretentious, non-epic slop!! The movie's final nail in the coffin comes from the incredibly bad ending where the Producers couldn't figure out if they wanted to give the audience a sad ending (not even bittersweet) or a happy one, so they decide to give us BOTH. I just simply hated this film! I place ""Atonement"" at the top of my ""Worst Films of 2007"" list! When the end credits rolled, I stood up & shouted ""That was crap""!! I still can't believe that this film got any award recognition??? I hated this film! The trailer showed one thing, then when you see the film, it goes into a whole different direction! This wasn't a love story by any means! This was a story about people who lie! That was it!! Norhting more, nothing less! I love when critics have been calling this a ""Romance"" film!! There wasn't any romance to be found!! I really really hated the main character of Briony Tallis! Come to think about it, none of the characters in ""Atonement"" were really memorable or had any redeeming qualities! I'm still trying to figure out how such great actors, like Christian Bale can be bypassed for a Golden Globe or any other type of recognition, but a piece of crap like ""Atonement"" gets wide spread acclaim!?!? None of the acting performances were ""WOW! I'm blown away by this""!! It was like Masterpiece Theater on really bad drugs!"

The war scene is totally staged and everyone seems to just stand around. The main male lead James McAvoy has one facial expression. It's like he's Keauna Reeves except British. Keira Knightley goes from hating him, to f*&@*^&ing in the library. The little girl is annoying. The war scene was supposed to be cool, yet it was just them walking. It ends with both leads dying.

","In 1935, in England, the upper class Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) is in love with Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the gentle son of the caretakers of their real state that will be sent to the medical school by the Tallis. After witnessing an incident between Cecilia and Robbie in the fountain of their property; snoop a letter that Robbie asked her to deliver to Cecilia; and see her sister making love with Robbie in the library, the thirteen year-old aspirant writer Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) misinterprets the events and believes that Robbie is a sex maniac. When her cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) is raped in a hot summer night in the garden of the Tallis real estate, Briony falsely accuses the innocent Robbie and he is sent to prison, affecting the lives of Robbie, Cecilia and their families.<br/><br/>The awesome ""Atonement"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen and a sad example of how unfair the Oscar is, since it is better and better than the awarded ""No Country for Old Men"". The wonderful screenplay, based on the British romance novel by Ian McEwan, discloses a magnificent story of atonement of a character that seeks redemption for her unthinkable attitude on the age of thirteen, and is supported by a stunning cast, fantastic cinematography, art direction, costume design and music score. The outstanding performance of the unknown Saoirse Ronan is impressive and her nomination to Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role is more than deserved. In my opinion, the performance of this young actress was superior to the winner and great actress Tilda Swinton in ""Michael Clayton"".

","I was deeply disappointed, having forced myself through the whole length of this movie (I should have left after the first boring-to-death 45 minutes). The bitter lesson to be learned for me: an excellent team (Joe Wright as director and Keira Knightley as leading actress in ""Pride and Prejudice"") gives you no guarantee that their next movie is anything alike in quality!<br/><br/>There was no chemistry between Keira Knightley and James McAvoy worth mentioning, like they were two strangers who are supposed to appear at the same scene (to achieve this: No Acting Required, as Robert Mitchum used to say). The narration of the whole story was erratic, and the motives of the figures remained nebulous. It is hard to find out what the whole story is about, what the meaning of the figures' action were (hopefully the novel is better, but I haven't read it yet, and in my opinion a movie shouldn't require the knowledge of the book in order to be understood).<br/><br/>Last but not least I found it extremely embarrassing how the movie failed to connect its narration with the cruelties of the World War. I couldn't help feeling that the war background was just abused as a picturesque stage to let James McAvoy stumble around."
"wisewebwoman","2","12","22","1 February 2008"," Pretentious Mess
","At the outset I will state that I did not like the novel on which this movie is based. It's not that I don't like the work of Ian MacEwan - I loved ""Saturday"" - but to my dread, the novel which I thought shallow to begin with was made into an even shallower movie.<br/><br/>I wasn't going to bother seeing it at all, but did on the recommendations of many friends who literally raved about it. Particularly the scenes of the war and old London.<br/><br/>There was literally no chemistry between the two leads and the direction of ""lunge and thrust"" in a key love scene repels rather than engages. I find Keira Knightly affected in the extreme, her pouty lips and chopped off sentences did not engage sympathy. She seemed alienated from everyone.<br/><br/>I was in a small mature audience at the screening and there was a lot of laughter at what should have been emotional scenes which again detracted from any investment in the film itself.<br/><br/>The story is cliché ridden and I thought, several times, it would have done better in more sensitive hands. I found the direction choppy and frantic. The timeline moves back and forth with no valid reasoning behind it apart from fooling the audience.<br/><br/>The war scenes are well done and would have worked better in another movie entirely. I found them ghostly and surreal, particularly the singing, the shooting of the horses, etc.<br/><br/>I beg the question: why are so many nominated movies so dismally awful this year? ""Atonement"" I found completely overrated, there was literally no sublety (in a movie that begged for it) and the characters were all distant, not one of them got my sympathy. Possibly it might have worked a lot better as a mini-series, the time frame of the film itself was too short to explore the back story of each key character and particularly the key feature of the love between Ce and Robbie. Was it simply lust? The basic story revolved around Briony (Saoirse Ronan) who is that beloved child of British movies, - a precocious, pretentious, self-absorbed writer. She reads a letter sent by the medical student son Robby, (James McAvoy) of the family housekeeper, to Briony's older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). Subsequently she witnesses scenes between them and a scene between a house-guest and a young girl and invents a story that puts the kybosh on the blossoming romance and sends our hero to jail and then off to war.<br/><br/>Some of the more mawkish scenes involve his attempts to re-unite with Cecilia. Cecilia, meanwhile, keeps her passion intact by abandoning her family to work as a waitress and waiting patiently for Robby.<br/><br/>There it is, I won't spoil the rest. Suffice to say it is a melodrama of a type of movie that were best done in the 1920's but best left alone in the twenty first century.<br/><br/>2 out of 10."

","Its not often that you can go to the cinema and use the word ""beautiful"" to describe a film, but in this case the word ""beautiful"" does not do Atonement justice.<br/><br/>The story follows a young teen named Briony played very well by Saoise Ronan, who witnesses her older sister Cecilia (Kiera Knightly) and gardener Robbie, whom she has a crush on (James McAvoy as close as he will ever get to an Oscar) making love in the library. After this she sees her cousin Lola being attacked in the garden and as a childish act of revenge, not fully realising the seriousness of her actions lies to the police and frames Robbie.<br/><br/>The story jumps on a few years and we see Robbie conscripted to the army and Cecilia, who has now left her family working as a nurse in London and a now grown up Briony training as a nurse trying to atone for the damage that she has caused.<br/><br/>I had not read the book before going to see the film and for the first time ever I am glad that I did not. There is an unexpected twist at the end of the movie that is absolutely devastating as we do not get the ending that we are accustomed to and if you become as engrossed as I was there will in all likelihood be tears.<br/><br/>The film is shot to perfection by Joe Wright, who now will be officially known as the director that made Kiera Knightly grow up and shake of the awful Pirates movies.<br/><br/>Every shot is just gorgeous to look at.<br/><br/>There is one long scene showing the evacuation at Dunkirk which on its own deserves an Oscar. It was not like usual war time scenes, all patriotic and noisy. I was very quiet apart from a group of soldiers singing in an old band stand. It is a very poignant scene and will be remembered for a long time to come.<br/><br/>This film is a shoe in for at least a couple of Oscars, and for once a film in the Oscar hunt has managed to quietly show its worth without any desperate Will Smith ""give me a Oscar please"" performances. James McAvoy and especially the young Saoise Ronan deserve at least a nomination.<br/><br/>I would honestly give this film a 10/10. It is hard to pick a fault in one of the best films of the year."

","What is wrong with Hollywood, the Oscars, and the film festivals these days? I'll tell you. Politics. Atonement won an Oscar -- for what? It's a film whose story leaves you angry and dissatisfied. Briony did in no way atone for her crime (lie). In fact, she was rewarded by having her novels published and no doubt getting rich. Her punishment should have been abject poverty the rest of her life, to be followed by death.<br/><br/>Anyone who liked this film has rocks in his/her head. Period.<br/><br/>You know, I came out to LA (like so many other hopefuls) to look for my chance in Hollywood with my stories and scripts. Why bother?! This town is mostly blind to quality and good stories. Sure, there are exceptions. Magnolia (corny but very, very well executed story). American Beauty (amazing - Kevin Spacey, what a performer!). Legends Of The Fall (beautifully shot, acted, story - everything). About Schmidt. Look people, these are films with powerful messages, that give us hope, that are entertaining and not boring (Atonement), that shed light on our difficult human condition.<br/><br/>I wouldn't waste my precious spittle on Atonement.

","The movie portrayed far too much evil without so much as a hint of redemption. It was hard enough to watch from the beginning, but the ending left me feeling as if I had been crapped on. The story line was monstrously sick and completely devoid of moral value. Giving it the title ""Atonement"" was deceptive, a horrible attempt to pretend that evil can be given some other face that what it has. There was nothing atoning about it, and the viewer is violated almost as much as the characters in the movie. I am appalled at the actors who agreed to do this, and shocked that people think it worthy of awards. It may well be the worst experience I have ever had in a theater. No one should see this unless doing research on how stories can distort the meaning of important concepts."

","I have to admit that it was hype and hype alone which encouraged me to go and see this movie. For weeks, every newspaper and TV show had reports and clips of how ""great"" the movie was. Also, it was directed by the same man who did ""Charles ii the Power and the Passion"" for BBC television and that is one of the best period dramas to be made in the last twenty years. So off I went to the cinema with high expectations. Then reality set in. There are three distinct parts to this movie. The beginning, which is too long. The middle, which is too abstract and the end, which is too predictable and makes huge sections of the middle obsolete. Yes, there is some fabulous cinematography and the performances are mannered and well directed. But the story gets lost somewhere. Perhaps it just got buried beneath the mounds of pretentious camera work and over-the-top attempts to create upper class British characters from the 1930s. I've not read the novel so I can't comment on how good or bad an adaptation it is. But as a piece of cinema, it disappoints."

","Unnecessarily confusing and poorly structured even though it had to have flashbacks for its Rashomon-like storytelling; this decade's 'trend' away from the chronological seems designed to hide flaws. The film's plot is really fairly simple, so the director and editor had to give far too much screen-time to certain scenes in an attempt to gloss over this fact (cinematography over substance). For example, the scene when McAvoy's character is struggling to find the right words while typing his apology, which is interspersed with Knightley's endless smoking, is excruciatingly slow. Instead of spending so much time with this point, how about letting us in on how his character received the wound to his chest? Also, while the Dunkirk sequence is an impressive technical accomplishment, it drags on almost dizzyingly and seems as if it were designed to lend a more serious subtext to the otherwise flimsy story. Along these lines, the filmmakers felt it necessary to add gratuitous hospital shots of the war wounded (and, earlier, used that ""most horrible word in the world""). Of course, you have to credit them for using Vanessa Redgrave in the Titanic-like Gloria Stuart denouement, which wraps the whole thing in a prettier package than its contents."

It was an okay book, even intriguing at times, with a nice use of language and description. But I felt it was a rather bloated, overlong way to make what is essentially a simple point: Don't lie.<br/><br/>That's probably why I didn't rush out to see the movie. But with all the Oscar buzz it was getting, I figured, why not? What works well as slow in a novel doesn't necessarily translate well to screen at the same slow pacing. A movie needs to have pacing, character development, something to hold attention. This just didn't do it. I thought the performances were just humdrum, even Keira Knightley, who has the ability to be so much better. The actresses playing Briony didn't accomplish much other than looking vaguely alike. And we never really get an opportunity to understand the romance between Cee and Robbie; it begins with a crude letter, peaks with one hasty sexual encounter, and then drops off into oblivion.<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography and musical score are all excellent, and I could spend all day watching the beautiful costumes and scenery. But I really found this movie merely mediocre overall. I can usually tell after exiting a movie theatre whether a movie will be one that I'll want to re-watch again and again.

And yes, I can even tolerate a bit of shallowness if the listed-above compensates in sufficient amounts. But what really annoys me (in any genre) is blatant pretentiousness. <br/><br/>This film oozes egomania. The direction is snobbish in a way that the director seems to be more interested in proving his ""ingenuity"" than in telling the story. And truth be told, there's not much story to tell. After the interesting, yet not less annoying first 45 minutes comes the stupidest waste of money I have seen in a long while. The complicated 5 minute shot that everybody's heard about even before the movie came out - huge disappointment. And you know what - Hitchcock's been there. Spielberg's been there. De Palma's been there. Now, if you have nothing new or interesting to say about it - get out or you can surely expect to be humiliated by your incompetence compared to the masters. But no! This director (known only for the single stupider period piece than this one - the lousiest adaptation of Pride and Prejudice ever) had huge appetites to satisfy. And hence - we are served with a boring, pretentious, overly stylized shot of what a coast in WWII France never looked like and the disillusioning effect created by McAavoy leaving the shot from time to time that should never happen if you expect your audience to be drawn in the movie and sympathize with the hero. <br/><br/>McCavoy is a great actor and we can surely expect great things from him in the future. But, hello, will the industry get over Keira Knightly already?! That woman is no actress. All she can do is pout her lips and strike a pose. The supporting cast is better than the leads, the photography is great, music is just fine, but, at the end of the day, who cares?

The ending, I felt, was satisfying, even beautiful in its own way. What bothered me was the beginning. I don't hate slow movies, but I often felt this movie needed to have a little nudge and an ""okay, get on with it."" Besides the first hour being slow, it left a horrible distaste in my mouth. All it delivered was a typical smut story wrapped up in an elegant package; a story that replaces love with lust and hopes it tricks the audience into believing it's amore. When I saw the vulgar letter I was shocked, surely a man would not write such things about a woman he loved. I saw her reaction and was absolutely disgusted. (I hate the word, and believe me, I don't hold back on expletives). I'm no prude, love scenes can be beautiful if the love story makes sense, but this love scene was intensely awkward and unemotional. Sure they say ""I Love You"" right before they start, but that did little to appease the situation. Then it lasted for about thirty seconds too long, making me want to return the popcorn I'd eaten back into the bag. It's not that it was grotesque; They didn't show nudity, or thrusting for that matter. It was the situation that kept this from working. While this was clearly supposed to be more, it came off as a mere 'hook-up' in a fashion many porno movies have taken: rich girl gets gardener/pool boy after gardener says something dirty. Love? I think not. You can't just have it in the script ""They are deeply in love."" This has to be shown. And the movie does show it, it just comes later on. But the first instance of their relationship looks so loveless and trite that it's hard to accept it after the fact.<br/><br/>The second half had some redeeming qualities, and the cinematography was spectacular, though Keira Knightley needs to put on about fifteen pounds lest her bones break through her skin. If one forgets the first half and just starts the story where two young lovers are separated and neglects their the awkward beginning, it helps, but that's hard to do. The story of Brioney, the aspiring author who sees the dangerous mistakes she made, is a nice one, and her attempt at redeeming herself is admirable and moving. But it all gets to the root of the love story, which didn't convince me of love at all, turning what could have been a good movie into an overrated lust story that tried to make up for itself a little too late."
"frendli","3","13","25","17 December 2007"," Fails to tell a compelling story
","Atonement fails to deliver a compelling story. It is plodding, lacks direction, and when it gathers momentum and manages to build tension, it fritters it away. The style gets in the way of storytelling. There's no real antagonist, and it's not even a romance. The romantic link between the Robbie & Cecilia is tenuous, and their supposed attachment and subsequent angst feels, since it's left to the imagination, contrived.<br/><br/>It drags at the outset, but eventually the characters become interesting and the relationships between them show promise, though it's still unclear what the movie is about. The film's jumping around in time and re-playing of a scene from a second perspective largely feels like an imposition of style at the expense of story. Despite this, through the first act of the movie, there was enough potential that I still thought it might deliver a compelling drama.<br/><br/>After the first big turning point, all the characters save the main three disappear. Cecilia is essentially abandoned as well, as her experiences in the intervening four years are barely given lip service. Robbie's story hints that he suffered in prison but we are never sure why, since all we get is the last few days of his attempt to return home. Why do they want each other so badly? How much have they been in touch? Why is Robbie in such a hurry, and what happens if he is late? We are not told. Instead, we are treated to an interminable montage on the beach at Dunkirque, pointlessly piling on the ambiance just in time for that storyline to end.<br/><br/>When the film finally rejoins the protagonist, Briany, it is the most potentially poignant part of the film. She has abandoned her personal ambitions and immersed herself in a life of service to try to atone for her lie and the damage it caused. At least this is interesting, since she is the least sympathetic of the three and even though we want her to earn redemption, she only makes it part way. But even this feels belabored and without direction: she is remorseful and feels she can't ever suffer enough to atone, yet there is no further interplay of the characters or deepening of their conflict. The final chance for this is squandered when the three characters finally come together near the end, and instead the story abruptly jumps 65 years into the future and the movie ends.<br/><br/>This movie fails to convey what the characters lost as a result of Briany's betrayal, never gives us enough to understand how their three lives were ruined, and hints at but never develops the potential for conflict between the three and tension surrounding Briany's possible redemption. Of the three, only Briany's suffering is really captured. I wanted to like it, but ultimately it fails to tell the story in a compelling way, and so it fails as a film."
"rajdoctor","5","13","25","15 December 2007"," Atonement
","The trailers were interesting. The star cast was stunning. The reviews were fantastic. The photography seemed perfect. This all lead me to see the movie  despite the fact that my boss  when asked how is Atonement  after a 5 second pause  said, um.meaning  not so good.<br/><br/>The story is set around the decade of world war II. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), jealous of her sister Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) love affair with Robbie Turner (James McAvoy); accuses Robbie of being a sexual perverse and raping her friend. Robbie is sent to prison and after 5 years, sent to serve the army in WWII. Grown up Briony (Romola Garai), serving as a nurse, despairs her lies and as part of atonement apologies to Robbie and sister Cecilia, but it is too late for Cecilia and Robbie to unite.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the popular novel written by Ian McEwan by the same name. The adaptation is synched in four parts  the first part of summer where Briony falsely accuses Robbie, the second part of WWII - Robbie serving the army, the third part of nursing  and atonement of Briony; and the fourth and final part of Briony's interview of the autobiographical novel.<br/><br/>The first part winds up slowly  as slowly as the British rural summers. It is wonderfully shot and as audience, one gets the feel of the real summer. This part is the most interesting because of the romance between Robbie and Cecilia. The army part of heavily funded and created, but is loose and does not build up the interest. While the nursing part is slowly un-winding of the mind of Briony, who recognizes and waits for her atonement.<br/><br/>I liked the first part the most. James McAvoy is the best thing in the movie, he brings to himself  so easily the boyish charm, and the vulnerability of an accused man, that his performance is worth noticing. One more cap after The Last King of Scotland. Keira Knightley has acted very well, but what on earth she has become? Like a walking stick  just bone and sticking flesh? Uh..what the world has come to be, defining her as the most sexiest and beautiful women. People must be really mad, and out of their minds.<br/><br/>The role of Briony was the strongest and is the 13 year old Saoirse Ronan renders with great punch and epoch, while the grown up role by Romola Garai  even though having depth, does not touch you or does not even leave an impression. A lot remained in the part three of the movie.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie were the cinematography by Seamus Greenwood and the musical score by Dario Marianelli, which was near to brilliant  especially the type writers strokes and that turning into music, with a slight synch with the character's tap of fingers or crossing of door. Brilliant! But overall movie experience, it leaves a lot more to be desired. Director Jeo Wright could have made it a much better movie, with the amount of talent and money available to him. Jeo was too detailed in dwelling into the era of three parts and missed out on the gripping narration.<br/><br/>A chance of good movie lost, but not that bad.<br/><br/>(Stars 5.5 out of 10)"

The performers, bless them, acted their socks off and did as much justice as was possible to a truly dreadful script, whilst the cinematography and locations were impressive enough, sympathetically chosen and splendid in their period feel but what really let the whole thing down was the disjointed direction and the constant leaping back and forth along the time-line. The whole Dunkirk scene was overly long and was vastly exaggerated than in the original book. It was almost as if it had been left in there because they had already spent the money so it would have been a shame to leave it on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, it was such a let down after having had all the ingredients to make it into yet another fantastic Brit Flick. A cast to die for (how wasteful to only include Brenda Blethyn for 2/3 very short scenes) a magnificent story and stunning locations - Working Title you wasted a glorious opportunity."

"AlanSKaufman","10","8","14","31 January 2008"," Atonement: All In The Mind
","Unrequited love: how torturous. Your feelings for another are never returned. At best, they simply ignore you. At worst, they mercilessly take advantage of you by accepting your gifts and attention, then brandishing their new partner(s). Slowly, your love painfully dies, and you only wish they would atone for their behavior.<br/><br/>The movie Atonement grasps this process. But your impression of its subject matter differs if you've seen previews luring you into witnessing a couple's passionate affair ruined by a jealous lover. You may also have heard about the ""Hitchcockian"" ending turning everything upside down.<br/><br/>Precisely the point: the plot is all in the mind. And this critical element, hinted at the film's opening, is missed both by those walking in late, and by the seated ones prejudiced from the trailers. You see, it immediately becomes clear that the entire movie will be the product of the central character, Briony, who initially is 13 years old. A different actress plays her at age 18, then she's portrayed at 77 by the superb Vanessa Redgrave. Briony writes fiction and thus is acutely aware how reality and fantasy sometimes merge. One must watch events through her eyes to properly understand the motives and consequences of the sexual gratification between older sister Cecilia and the housekeeper's son, Robbie, for whom Briony has a crush.<br/><br/>Though having called Briony his pal, Robbie bluntly uses her to deliver a letter to Cecilia. When C & R get around to doing it, it's in the house library, and they know full well that Briony could enter at any second as in fact occurs. C'mon, this liaison is pure lust in front of a minor, and at that moment, I absolved Briony for whatever she subsequently did, including erroneously testifying that Robbie later raped her cousin, also a minor. The atonement Briony endures for having Robbie convicted of the wrong crime is belied by the film concentrating half its length on Robbie suffering in World War II combat. Indeed, he is the one who needed to atone for his sin.<br/><br/>Leaving for duty, Robbie has a brief meeting with Cecilia as she awaits a bus on a London street. Acknowledging his discomfort with their library encounter, he's uncertain what he felt with her or if a loving relationship could ever develop. During the war, when he becomes very ill, his soldier buddy tenderly strokes his forehead. Ironically, from this man, Robbie receives the heartfelt love totally absent from his making love with Cecilia.<br/><br/>In several places we observe a scene performed twice with different interpretations. That's because of Briony's alternate takes. After all, don't you sometimes think you were crazy for loving someone who treated you as worthless, or imagine they rejected you as a lovesick fool and expected your atonement for wasting their time? Of course, all along they actually did whatever they pleased, and as they continue to prosper, you are left alone with your abject thoughts.<br/><br/>The Bible tells us that God does not forgive the unrepentant. We're trying to be more than Divine if we attempt to do so. Instead, identify with a young girl, Briony, who spends the rest of her life creatively dealing with the callousness of others. Perhaps, all in your mind, you will find from those having hurt you, atonement in Atonement.<br/><br/>Peace."

","I have been looking forward to seeing Atonement for a while, I like a lot of different period pieces and this looked like a great one. Then the awards have been coming to it, unfortunately, it didn't come to my town for a while, until recently and my mom and I finally saw Atonement today and we both loved it. It has such a beautiful love story, lovely costumes, incredible scenery, and wonderful actors. Keira Knightly has just come such a long way these past few years and she's becoming a wonderful actress, she was the perfect choice for Cecille. James McAvoy, this is the first film I have seen him in, I know he's a rising star and from this movie I can see why, he has the perfect charm that lights up a screen. These two actors clicked so well together and were lovely. Romola Garai as the older Briony was the perfect choice as well, she brought almost a sense of sympathy for her character, an understanding. The entire cast brought this wonderful story to life.<br/><br/>Briony is a thirteen year old girl in the 1930's, she has quite the imagination, she writes plays and stories. She also has an older sister, Cecille, who is more loved in some ways, especially by Briony's crush, Robbie. Robbie and Cecille fall in love, but when Robbie gives Briony the wrong letter to give to Cecille that has explicit sexual language, Cecille becomes more angry when she catches Robbie and Cecille together making love. Later that night, Briony sees her cousin being raped by a man and accuses Robbie of it, Robbie goes to prison and eventually fights in WWII. Robbie and Cecille to find each other again years later and promise each other to live happily ever after. But Robbie must fight in the war once again. Briony is now a WWII nurse and is living with the guilty conscience of accusing an innocent man of a hideous crime, she riped the love of her sister's life right out of her hands and now she must tell the truth, even if it is too late.<br/><br/>Atonement is one of the best films of 2007. It was very interestingly made, it has a strange time sequence. But I think from what I know, is that Atonement is a long book, so they probably had to chop a lot of the story up into two hours. But don't worry, the story is easy to follow throughout the film. My mom and I couldn't get over the sets and the costumes, they were absolutely stunning and we're hoping the awards go to Atonement for best costume. Atonement is a beautiful story of love, sisterhood, friendship, betrayal, and imagination, it's a terrific film. It's a film not to be missed, I'm in a big bind now where I'm not sure what film to root for best picture, because Atonement is going to be a good classic in a few years.<br/><br/>9/10"

My friends weren't extremely bothered about it, but I loved this movie  in my opinion it was one of the best period dramas ever. We all agreed that the best bit was how amazing the three actresses who played Briony were  in the looks department and with their mannerisms. I absolutely loved the typewriter music, and how everything seemed to slot together much like a typewriter - fitting in with the theme of how storytelling can have both a destructive and redemptive power. I also loved the fact that the scenery in the first part of the movie took me to a child-like place of fantasy stories. As for the storyline  I thought it was magnificent  and I didn't expect the ending at all. I would recommend it if you appreciate excellent casting, countryside, and above all, a fantastic story."

","When I went to the cinema I expected one solid drama with Keira Knightley in a leading role. But instead I walked out of the cinema with that feeling when you know that you just watched one hell of movie. Ian McEwan's novel is brought to life in this great movie about love, actually about love story of Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis. Cecilia's younger sister Briony wrongfully accuses Robbie for raping her cousin Lola. Briony's strong imagination pulls many events in the future as Robbie ends up in prison and Cecilia losses her love of life. Briony's misunderstanding leads to a terrible crime whose consequences follow them through World War II.<br/><br/>After ""Pride & Prejudice"", director Joe Wright decided to make another movie that is based on a book and this one is a winner and quite possibly the winner of Oscar for Best Picture in the next year. ""Atonement"" gives us few strong performances but James McAvoy steals the show. That scene in the house when Briony visits Cecilia and Robbie is great. Saoirse Ronan shows great potential, Keira Knightley isn't long in this movie but she's good as usual and Vanessa Redgrave is excellent as older Briony. But what really amazed me is how Wright tells us this story in beautiful simplicity, with returning in the past but never leaves the viewer with questions cause he presents all the answers. One scene is amazing and that is when Robbie comes to the beach with his fellow soldiers. Really breathtaking and spectacular scene, cause ""Atonement"" is one beautiful but sad story and it is really shame to miss it, so go and watch one of top 10 movies in this year."
"hthbrr2","1","13","26","24 December 2011"," Horrible pointless movie.
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>The movie takes place just before WWII breaks out. WWII was HORRIBLE; Hitler, The Holocaust, lots of innocent people died. MY GOD! We can ALL agree that it was a really bad thing. So y in the HELL would these idiots write ANOTHER sad story ON TOP of all the HORRIBLENESS going on around them. IF Cecilia & Robbie had a HAPPY (as happy as u can get during this time) ending the movie would have been ACTUALLY good. But when they both die it just makes THE WHOLE THING POINTLESS!<br/><br/>The movie starts in a confusing way. We r following a little girl. We have no set up. Who is she? Why should I care? I hate movies that keep facts from us 2 ""build mystery."" It's only a mystery if u already told us all the facts and WE have not figured it out.<br/><br/>This little girl misinterprets events as sinister. Her sister, Cecelia, was having an argument with this Robbie guy. She jumped in a fountain & Robbie stared at her. Okay? How can this b sinister? The ""lovemaking"" scene in the library. How can this girl think this was rape? Cecelia was not fighting him, screaming, NOTHING! These non-sense making scenes r shown 2 ways in order 2 ""explain"" y this little girl thinks something bad happened. I wish Ricky Ricardo was present 2 say, ""U've got some 'splaning 2 do!""<br/><br/>Also, the library scene drove me crazy! This house is shown 2 us at the start of the movie with Briony running though it. From this we know that it has MANY ROOMS. ROOMS with beds in them! ROOMS with LOCKS ON THE DOORS! But what room do they choose!?; THE LIBRARY! A place where ppl converge frequently! & THEY LEFT THE DOOR AJAR! What the %#@$!? These 2 ppl KNOW that there r small children in this house. So u'd think they would think; ""What if they walked in?"" No, no. They just seem 2 b complete idiots! When watching this particular scene I thought ""Y did they not choose another room?"" When u have wild crazy b00m b00m time & leave the door open someone will c u! Duh!<br/><br/>So then this little girl thinks she saw Robbie r@pe the other little girl & Robbie gets shipped off 2 war. Cecelia does LITTLE 2 save him. OK, this is supposed 2 b a romance movie. Hmm, Cecelia does not seem 2 care much when ALL she says in defense of Robbie is ""I would not put much stock in what she says; she has a wild imagination."" Something like that. Not even hysterically. She says it not even HALF-heartedly. But with indifference! INDIFFERENCE! sarcasm-Wow it MUST b love!-sarcasm Cecelia seems 2 half BELIEVE what Briony is saying! How can u <3 someone & even THINK that they r capable of SUCH evil!? Or how little do u know them?<br/><br/>I believe what the other reviewers said that this was not a romance movie but just an excuse 2 get certain shots. The backdrop was pretty. The outfits were very beautiful especially Cecelia's green dress! The point is; is that it's an empty movie.<br/><br/>It's so pointless cuz it's just senseless. There is no lesson 2 b learned. & most importantly NO atonement. U ruined 2 people's lives & u became a BEST SELLING author. THAT'S atonement!? Writing a FICTIONAL happy ending!? WTF!? It's like saying, ""I shot a bunch of innocent people but I made a painting of them all happy & smiling that should make it alright."" WOW! Just wow! I did not know that u could cram this much ignorance in2 1 movie!<br/><br/>Anyway u slice it; it's just pointless. What if Briony had not been ""jealous"" (cuz how can Briony even <3 Robbie if she is OK with him suffering?) & did not say Robbie raped that little girl? War would have still broken out. Would Robbie b in medical school? Would that have saved him from fighting? Not sure on British law at the time. But if there was a draft then he would have been screwed either way. What about Cecelia? Would she not have bcome a nurse 2 help out & b evacuated 2 the place where she drowned? What's the point of it all? At the end Briony said that she gave them the time they so desperately wanted. How much time was that? Cecelia & Robbie BOTH admit that THEY wasted a lot of time 2! So what they could of had a COUPLE of years of ""good times"" & then die horrible deaths? Is that all; time? That's all these 2 could have AT BEST? Wow how depressing."

","Wright shows us a beautiful, intriguing and dark painting called 'Atonement'. Based on Ian McEwan's novel, is based on three principal characters and how a lie told by one of them changes all three of their lives forever. The character Briony is one of the most interesting characters in recent cinema. While the story is impactful, 'Atonement' is also marvelous to look at. The frames, the amazing cinematography (especially long shots e.g. set in Dunkirk, closeups and underwater shots), the music and the sets and locations are more than impressive and highly add to the poetry of the story.<br/><br/>The complex characters in demand strong performances. Sadly, Keira Knightley does not impress. I've never thought of her as a great actress. Here, she just lacks the nuances of a woman of that time (the film is set in the 30s) and she seriously needs to eat. James McAvoy is great. Child actress Saoirse Ronan is brilliant (certainly not the irritating child performances we so often see in films). She underplays her part with a certain dignity. Romola Garai is phenomenal in a briefer role. Supporting cast, that includes Gina McKee, Brenda Blethyn and Vanessa Redgrave, is good (as the aforementioned actresses have hardly ever disappointed).<br/><br/>'Atonement' is cleverly told from two different perspectives, that of what really happened and what Briony thinks/imagined. At times, it the film's sudden shift of gear (e.g. switching to the war scenes) feels odd but it comes to an almost full circle towards the end. I found the smoking habit of the characters (which was sort of in your face) annoying. Also, at times, the pacing was very slow. The ending is quite profound and it is left for the viewers to interpret and to seek an answer to a question that will definitely stay in mind long after the film's ended. In one word, I'd describe this film as a brilliant piece of work."
"filmfan92","10","7","12","1 March 2008"," Nothing to ""Atone"" For
","""Atonement"" is a rarity; the prestige-slathered Oscar treat that, far from being driven by look-at-me desperation, is both watchable and commendable. The story is epic, but Joe Wright moves along Ian McEwan's epic of childish lies (the child being the radiant Saoirse Ronan) and adult war (waged, both socially and on the frontlines, by soldier James McAvoy and nurses Keira Knightley and, playing an adult version of Ronan, Romola Garai) with the precision and clarity of a diamond cutter. The acting is all around top-notch; with the performances being that of McAvoy and Vanessa Redgrave (playing an even older version of Garai). Both have a moment or two where there character turns the film around, and they both manage to do it not only without looking ridiculous, but with a simple, clipped poignancy that lends the film an edge of raw emotion. This movie, however, is driven by behind the scenes workers. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (robbed come Oscar time!) has created an incomparable visual feast of the kind not seen since the hey-day of David Lean or Stanley Kubrick, and Dario Marinelli creates a brilliant, moving score. Sure, occasionally the movies reach exceeds its grasp-the war scenes never do cut deep enough- but who cares when the grasp is so bold and ingeniously constructed? Atonement is a flawed but impeccable gem in the crown of a great, great year for movies."

"Monotreme02","9","7","12","25 December 2007"," So close to utter and absolute cinematic perfection
","I must admit that I haven't read the novel this film is based on but got a pretty good impression as to its quality judging by the film alone. Simply put, the film tells an absolutely fantastic story that keeps us engaged, enthralled and entranced from the first clicks of Briony's typewriter. Ian McEwan's ambitious tale begins with a whirlwind, joyous and beautiful depiction of young romance, which is so unbelievably dreadfully thrust into a continuous downward spiral of tragedy and disaster. And if this hurricane of tragedy, unrequited emotions and heavy guilt isn't enough, the story is topped off with quite possibly the most tragic, heart wrenching plot point in recent years, as the old version of the Briony character, played by Vanessa Redgrave, comes clean with a shocking revelation. In all, the storytelling structure of the film is fascinating and absolutely thrilling to witness. The same events are shown from multiple reverse angles; mid-way through the story relentlessly jumps forward to a time after what we know were years of pain and agony for our protagonists; and finally, the footnote at the end of the film, the gut-wrenching revelation which throws everything into question and shines a stark, illuminating light on the true nature of the film's emotional tragedy.<br/><br/>Wright, this being his second directorial work after Pride and Prejudice, manages to most exceptionally capture the very balance of the work: the balance between broad themes of love, betrayal, tragedy and atonement and between the fine simplicities and nuances such as how his characters talk, act and interact. The film features a stunning balance on Wright's part between sequences of a thrilling, epic nature and scenes of beautiful nuance and subtlety. The entire film has a kind of driving energy behind it propelling the scenes forward in a relentless pace; Wright manages to turn Briony's pressing, triumphant dash through the long hallways of her home in order to show off her newly finished play into a fantastically thrilling scene of excitement and urgency, utilizing all of the cinematic tools available to him. Utilizing all these elements, Wright displays an uncanny technical and cinematic virtuosity, incarnated in all of the cinematic elements the film has to offer.<br/><br/>Wright further guarantees his status as a directorial force to be reckoned with in the star-making performances by his young cast. Kiera Knightley had already proved her acting talent in her Oscar-nominated performance in Pride and Prejudice, incidentally also directed by Joe Wright, but it is in Atonement that she delivers her most wonderful, mature and best performance of her career so far. She carries with her an air of maturity, elegance and grace and of course perpetual beauty and snaps out her high class lines with such incredible crass and rapidity, one can simply see the young, adventurous lust just waiting to burst out from underneath. James McAvoy, whose star has been on the constant rise since his starring role in last year's The Last King of Scotland, is sure to get a well-deserved kick into leading man recognition, and his incredibly intense and wonderfully romantic turn in this film is also a career best. Both these actors essentially deliver two roles: the first half depicts their beautiful adolescent, blooming romance and they play the characters so charmingly, we can't help but feel that nobody in the world deserves more to be together than they to. But in the second half of the film, after the tragedy, both portray different versions of their younger selves: Obviously older and more mature, but also skeptic, heartbroken, and desperately, obsessively holding on to the smallest thread of hope they both have of reuniting. The real stunner in the show, though, is young Saoirse Ronan, who plays the 13-year-old version of Briony with such precise, calculated intelligence that the girl is truly frightful. Her prepubescent impatience, immaturity, anger and jealousy seem dangerously harmless at first, but we soon learn that she carries within her an immense destructive power, the reciprocations of which show on both the 18-year-old version and the older version of herself.<br/><br/>Impressive as it is, it is nothing new for a director's sophomore cinematic venture to be so skillful. Pulp Fiction, Rushmore, Boogie Nights, and Requiem for a Dream are merely a few examples of director's sophomore frames. But what makes Atonement truly extraordinary as a director's second feature is that it is not the work of a very talented and devoted film geek; but rather, a seminal, beautiful piece of work striking in its resonant thematic prominence, its maturity and also its wondrous display of cinematic aptitude. Joe Wright has directed not one but two period works (Atonement and Pride and Prejudice) one would come to expect from an older generation of filmmakers such as James Ivory, Michael Apted, or Shekhar Kapur  and Wright is only 35 years old. He is without a doubt the youngest director who has managed to capture the precise restraint and calculated technical proficiency to create a good period picture, and with Atonement manages to create much more than that. Suffice it to say that Wright is a director to watch, and if Pride and Prejudice had me interested in his upcoming projects, after Atonement I now eagerly anticipate them. I hope for more of the best from him, and from all of the film's cast and crew, who should all get well-deserved career boosts due to the film's critical success."

","A cracking piece of film-making this.<br/><br/>Beautifully filmed, acted and realised, this has to be the movie of the year.

There is an ominous feel to the opening scenes, as a precursor to the later scenes, but many funny moments. This is aided by an excellent soundtrack; compare the witty use of typing in the score and how it is echoed in gunfire later on.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley and James McAvoy really earn their acting stripes here - these are subtle and deeply emotional, but also wonderfully repressed, performances.<br/><br/>Hats off to Joe Wright!"
"Quinoa1984","7","10","19","24 December 2007"," half the time great drama of a crisis in ego, and the other half...
","Atonement is being acclaimed now as one of the best films of the year, a surefire contender for the best picture prize at the Oscars (at least, apparently, as a ""proper"" film as opposed to the crime classic No Country for Old Men). It's not hard to understand it, for a good lot of the running time; Joe Wright, the director, has taken what is an apparently beautiful book (unread by me) and transformed it into the stuff of true existential crises. It's about a young girl, Briony, who witnesses what she thought she saw as a crime. This might seem unclear at first, but it isn't, it's a clear move on the part of immediate revenge for a tryst she witnessed between her sister and a worker (Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy). He's sent to prison, then to war, where unforeseen circumstances may change everyone's lives.<br/><br/>Doesn't sound like a bad premise, with a good dosage of romance in the mix. And for the first half hour, forty minutes it IS great film-making of a tense nature, focusing on the young girl who just wants to be the center of attention with her first play and is cut-off by family and other matters that flock away. All of this is filmed by Wright, and acted by the case, quite absorbingly, and by the end you really care what will happen to poor Robbie... But then the story takes a turn that only slightly recovers in the last ten or so minutes. Suddenly the point of view changes- which, I suppose, is also true to the book, albeit from what I've heard lopping off some bits and pieces that would have made it a longer but richer film- to Robbie fighting in the war, though not exactly 'fighting'. He walks around a lot, comes across a beach-front of soldiers (in a startling 5 minute long take no less, indulgent but effective), and yet this coupled later with the emergence of the Briony as a nurse doesn't really click for me.<br/><br/>Yes, it should be compelling cinema to see Robbie suffering along with all the other British in the midst of the early, rough days of WW2, but what Wright shows us isn't much more compelling (or, for that matter, as well done) as any given number of war pictures of the period done in the present; even a harsh hospital scene with wounded only works so much until it's overkill. When the point of view changes it suffers, and when it finally returns to Brialy it takes some time to get adjusted back in it all (not helped by a nearly too restrained performance by Romola Garai, particularly in dramatic scenes where, whether or not they actually happened, should be believable). I may be in the minority here from the masses who are praising Atonement to the sky, but only when Vanessa Redgrave appears does the film finally offer a satisfying catharsis.<br/><br/>It's a sad thing too, because when Atonement is at its best it's what many dramas, particularly those of this kind of period setting, seem to lack in dealing the old love-and-war story. This time real danger, caused by complete human error in youth and judgment, is in the mix, and it provides a level of interest in what will happen to the characters. That Knightly and McAvoy work so well speaks to the director's gifts. I just wished that Wright either made the film longer to make it even more of an epic feat, or knew how to deal with the change in perspective of narrative for a FILM, as opposed to in a novel."
"sioenroux","2","14","29","24 December 2007"," Pretty pictures and a director that ruined the story
","I bet this was a great novel. Sadly, though, it didn't translate. The director wastes a lot of time on plot that has nothing to do with anything (the play that Briony writes? what a waste) and as a result doesn't have the time to give us the character development and blossoming love that make the actual underpinnings of a love story.<br/><br/>I still have no idea why the two characters loved each other. We weren't even given a montage to let us know they had spent time together in ways that would show their love.<br/><br/>Similarly, we never get to understand Briony's growth. By the end, I don't know why she sought atonement.<br/><br/>For all the romance-novel weepies out there, I'm sure they can just take all that as writ and have themselves a good heart-tugging cry. I myself expect a director to reveal characters to me and engender emotion in me, rather than just expect me to make it up out of nothing.<br/><br/>On the level of craft, though, this movie was splendid. Beautiful shots, gorgeous scenery, nice-looking stars and crisp sound (and a nicely understated soundtrack that didn't insist on telling you how to feel ever moment). The two leads probably are quite talented, but here, they had almost nothing to do except mug a bit.<br/><br/>It's too bad all of that was wasted, because if the director didn't force us to assume so much of the important events in the story (I seem to recall that love stories should actually have scenes that show you the people falling and being in love), this could have been powerful and moving.<br/><br/>As it was, I was yelling at the screen and feeling nothing toward any of them. I was cheated."

","I knew from the first few moments of ""Pride and Prejudice"" that we were in the hands of someone who understood literature cinematically. Austen is virtually impossible to film because typical of many books, it requires some ambiguity about internal ruminations and the observed events. He mapped this into shifting layers and inside-outside in the very first scene. I moved forward in my seat.<br/><br/>Here he is much, much better because he is filming a book written with cinematic values. I cannot say if it is a well-written book. The basic story itself is ordinary, sort of a reverse Lolita with the young girl as the writer and untrusted narrator. (There is one key shot. Everything else up until the ""visit"" is witnessed by others except the corpses of schoolgirls. This is the only scene that is staged in a stylistically unrealistic way, and it should be a tipoff that Briony's story is folded into the outer wrapper as well as the events we see.)<br/><br/>The most notable trick he does is use the typewriter in a pervasive way, in the story, in the writing of the story, in the score and even in the eye toward the end.<br/><br/>He uses camera movement in wonderful ways. For instance, he has Briony move on the upper corridor and stairs of her home in precisely the same movement the older Brony does through the hospital beds, except this time we know it is her eye we are using and her memory we are plumbing. There's the amazing one-take sequence at Dunkirk. Its not like the P T Anderson ripoff of Urusevsky where he just touches characters; instead it is derived from ""Soy Cuba"" and ""Touch of Evil"" in the sense that both deep and contextual narrative is conveyed. Again, we learn that this is coherently constructed by the writer and not witnessed.<br/><br/>The business of our hero being folded into ""Port of Shadows,"" (about a deserter  we never learn why Robbie was separated from his company) isn't unique, but its apt and deep. Movies, books, pictures, stories about stories about lies.<br/><br/>I don't know Juno Temple from elsewhere  though I know she was in ""Notes on a Scandal"" which I saw, but she is the real villain here and she pulls it off well, as does her counterpart the young Briony.<br/><br/>In preparation for this, I saw ""Soy Cuba"" because I knew this would have the Soviet eye, and the 75 ""Great Gatsby,"" with which this shares quite a few values, including some of the story. I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>It works. Its intelligent. Its cinematic and literary. Keira is tolerable. There's a great speech about letting the Germans have France. You should see it.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Atonement beautifully and lovingly reconstructs the high life of the British aristocracy between the wars and the early, dark days of World War II. Unfortunately, there is much less to it than meets the eye. While the filmmaker clearly wishes us to feel a profound sense of horror and injustice at the false accusation laid against an innocent man which rests at the heart of the film, I couldn't help but feel that somehow the real horror was that this charge was laid against someone who was model handsome and well-educated, and that the punishment he suffered was relatively light by contemporary American standards. Nor could I feel anything at all for the girl whose efforts to atone for these accusation give the film its name, in large part because her initially interesting and lively character is replaced mid film by a zombie-like creature whose sole expression is a vacant stare. The film is redeemed from near triviality by a rather ingenious deus ex machina. Still, for me at least, it worked only as lavishly illustrated historical fiction, and not as drama."

","What is up with all these 1, and 2 star reviews!? Even if the film differs from the novel by Ian McEwan (which, I would not know as I have not read the book yet) at least take this film for what it is - a beautiful & haunting story of a love torn apart by a child's mistake, and stop making comparison's of how bad this film is compared to the book because it deserves to be judged on it's own right too. The story is gorgeous - James McAvoy and Keria Knightley play the lovers Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis, who, upon finally admitting their feelings for each other are torn apart as Robbie is sent to prison for allegedly raping the Tallis' cousin Lola Quincey. However, Robbie was not guilty, and was only thought so because Cecilia's younger sister, Briony Tallis, jumped to the wrong conclusion. The remainder of the film tells of what happens to Robbie, Cecilia, and Tallis years after this event, and ultimately, whether the lovers ever managed to be together and have the happy ending they deserved.<br/><br/>This film is achingly sad - all about lost opportunities, what may have been contrasted to what was, and how a single mistake can rip apart a person's entire life. 3 people suffered greatly at the hands of the lie, and the film is about Briony's attempts to repair the wound she created, because, as she grew up, she realised how devastatingly wrong her actions were. The acting in this film is superb. I have always been a fan of James McAvoy and this is probably my favourite performance by him - McAvoy acts with such subtlety and intensity, in every scene you can feel his emotions, exactly what the character of Robbie is feeling, even when he doesn't say a single word. I've never been the biggest fan of Keira Knightley (actually, I believe her acting in the POTC films is quite simply, dreadful), but she blew me away as Cecilia Tallis - I don't know whether she felt more at home with this type of character, or whether her movie experiences since have improved her acting skills drastically, but she embodied the character of Cecilia perfectly, playing the party, very, very well. But, my favourite performance by far has to be from Saoirse Ronan (very unusual name) as the 13 year old Briony Tallis - it is one of those instances where you don't even realise this is an actor playing a part - she was entirely believable and more than faultless in her performance.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film that I believe will be remembered in many years to come. It thoroughly deserves every one of those 5 stars I have given it, and probably more. It is a subtle, intense, hauntingly beautiful film with brilliant acting, phenomenal direction, a very good script (though how much of that came straight out of the novel I do not know) and even a perfect soundtrack. Faultless. And beautiful. Watch it now."

"jzappa","10","5","8","20 May 2008"," A Magically Crafted Film
","As a lifelong admirer of movies, I have come to believe that everyone has a cinematic sense, the way they would envision of a film of their own. Atonement beautifies my own cinematic sense, thus I relate so intensely to director Joe Wright's techniques. Though he admits to his beautiful, emotional, near logistically impossible tracking shot that entirely composes the powerful Dunkirk evacuation sequence as showing off, that doesn't matter, because the impression with which it furnishes us is that of an uninterrupted perspective, not James McAvoy's but ours as we behold the juxtaposition of what he is ceaselessly seeing and his reaction to it. Each scene is its own self-contained short film, almost as if Kurosawa had directed this film. Kurosawa was never as hyperkinetic or confronting as Wright, the visual language of Atonement has the same tautness and precision serving as genesis of an emotional response as Sanjuro, Seven Samurai, or One Wonderful Sunday.<br/><br/>Wright's meticulous stylization is thorough and consistent, as it isn't simply lathered on top of the story but is essentially the storyteller, enhancing and driving the story, segregating itself as its own version of Ian McEwan's novel, rather than simply a novel told on film. Each scene flows seamlessly into the next, a tremendous credit that goes to the editing as well as the already honored cinematography, creating an amalgam of each character's point of view of the same events, their different reactions, our own reactions, the achingly longed-for fantasies the characters attempt to will into reality, and of course reality itself.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley and McAvoy are airtight within the feelings and personal interpretations of an upper-English student and the son of her parents' housekeeper sharing an obstructed and undying love and animal attraction, however it is Saoirse Ronan, the young girl who plays the 13-year-old version of Knightley's avidly creative younger sister, portraying a stage in the younger sister's life that has yet to realize the overwhelming regret she will endure. It's Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of her in the final stage of her life that almost magically reflects Ronan, something you cannot just plan.<br/><br/>Despite recent achievements in American film that have shattered standards and transcended the capabilities of each aspect of the medium, Atonement outdoes in both departments. It's hard to bring to mind the last time I saw a movie so alive in all departments. I was even fascinated with the way people smoked in the film. Even the music goes beyond the expectations of even masterfully done films, as it takes the form of the uniform sounds recognized in the characters' lives, masking itself as the many-sensed rhythm of the story.<br/><br/>2007 is a tremendous year for American movies, one of the best in its history. It would only be right for Atonement to receive the praise, recognition, and accolades with which other masterpieces of 2007 are awash."
"blanbrn","7","5","8","21 January 2008"," An epic tale of lust, love, war, and guilt with remorse.
","""Atonement"" is clearly a fine work of art on screen that's greatly influenced by literature. It has all the classic elements of literature and classic prose from lust, love, war, and in the end the central character writer Briony Tallis feeling guilt and remorse for a false accusation. The film will clearly bring out emotions especially if your genre of choice is romance and passionate love, yet you will have wished for more proved truth and justice to have happened earlier in the film even though it's revealed in the end.<br/><br/>Set in the mid 1930's in England the film has a classy and elegant setting like all British films you feel the grace of the family. You quickly become swept up by the beginning and desire for dreams as little young darling Briony Tallis(Saoirse Ronan)is caught up in a world of plays, imagination and stories she wants to happen ranging from joy to love. Her older sister is looked upon from her as an inspiration Cecilia Tallis(Keira Knightley)a young lady who's eager for love and romance escape by desire and pleasure. Only young Briony sees an unpleasant and uneasy sight from Cecilia's new love interest as dashing Robbie Turner's ambition for lust will soon send him on an unpleasant and long journey that will make him struggle for love and happiness.<br/><br/>As ""Atonement"" spans thru time into war of the gruesome blood and death that Robbie sees while fighting as a solider, Briony's story unfolds as the time changes with her sister growing up and moving on to nurse school and Briony herself with take the same job path. All along the flashbacks of love and joy are presented so well only like a classic work of literature it reveals the painful truth of justice and honesty in the end as we see an old and aging Briony who has it all wrapped up in her last and greatest and most soul truth searching novel piece. You the viewer should finally feel the truth and justice.<br/><br/>Overall ""Atonement"" is a good film I will not call it great because the war and romance genre isn't my favorite, yet it still has enough classic literary elements like lust, love, and the search for truthful justice to make it interesting and enjoyable to watch."

","Briony (Saoirse Ronan), a precocious thirteen year old, and young adult Cecelia (Keira Knightley) are the daughters of a wealthy, landowning family of Britain. An aspiring writer, Briony is highly observant of any and all activity surrounding her small world. One day, she happens upon her sister, not once, but twice, in a romantic encounter with Robbie (James McAvoy). Robbie is the son of a household staff member (Brenda Blethyn) and has worked on the gardens of the estate but he has also been educated by the family's patriarch. He is an intelligent and handsome man, with a good heart. However, Briony also has a crush on Robbie and her jealousy sets off a tragic state of affairs. When two young male cousins of the girls, dropped off at the mansion by divorcing parents, decide to ""run away"", the entire household searches for them in the dark of night. When Briony, flashlight in hand, stumbles across a man assaulting the young cousins' sister, she decides to tell the police that Robbie is the rapist. It is categorically untrue but, alas, Robbie is sent to jail. Five years later, Robbie is let out of prison to become a soldier for Britian in World War I and Cecelia, too, runs away from her family to work as a military nurse. The couple, still greatly in love, meet briefly but make plans to be together forever, when the war is over. Briony, too, enlists as a nurse and tries to contact her sister to ask for forgiveness and to make amends. But, can anything atone for the ruination of two lives? This is a movie of astonishing, tragic beauty. The principal actors, Knightley, Ronan, Blethyn, McAvoy, Vanessa Redgrave, and others are all superlative, giving it their all as the doomed, complex characters. Equally beautiful are the costumes, the settings, and the cinematography, for it would hard to find a more breathtakingly sumptuous film. Yet, even then, it is the story and the direction that should receive the most applause. This is a tale of woe on an epic scale, very intricate and very unsettling. More importantly, the direction is amazing, with happenings often told twice, from different perspectives, with seamless and subtle integration. The result is a work of art of the highest degree, deserving of infinite praise. In short, do not miss Atonement. It can send any serious film viewer into a rapturous state of mind."

A person can find the film funny, gross, touching and of course sad. The ending of the movie was both happy and sad. Certain people will find upsetting and awful and others will find it happy and good.

"jdkraus","10","5","8","29 December 2007"," Like reading a book; you need to decide on it for yourself
","I waited several months to see this movie. After finally seeing it, it was hard for me to decide whether I really enjoyed it or not. My expectations, as the advertisement built it up as if it were the next English Patient. To a degree, it has some similarities with the flashbacks and romance but instead of the story being told by the lovers, it is told by a third party. <br/><br/>In 1935, 13-year-old apprentice writer Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) and her family live a life of wealth and luxury in their enormous mansion. Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the family's grounds keeper, has feelings for Briony's older sister Cecilia (Ms. Knightley). He hopes she has similar feelings towards him. All it will take is one spark for this relationship to illuminate. When it does, Briony who has a crush on Robbie is compelled to interfere, going so far as accusing Robbie of a crime he did not commit. Cecilia and Robbie declare their love for each other, but he is arrested. By Briony's false witness, the course of three lives is changed forever. Later on in life, Briony comes to her senses and realizes what she had done and seeks for atonement.<br/><br/>An interesting aspect to the film was how well it showed different perspectives. For instance, there is a scene where Robbie and Cecelia stand and talk near a fountain. It first shows a 13 year old Briony looking at them through a window, wondering what they're talking about. Right after that, the film shows the same scene through Robbie's and Cecelia's viewpoint of what they actually said and did. <br/><br/>The editing was unpredictable at times and made me somewhat confused, but the more I thought about it, the more interested and engrossed I felt about the movie. It was like reading the original novel, leaving the audience to ponder on what'll happen next and how everything would be tied together. The 130 minute film was not set at quick pace, but the character's different stories and viewpoints made it an enjoyable and deep thought movie. <br/><br/>The direction was absolutely breathtaking. One of the most amazing scenes in the movie was when Robbie entered Dunkirk. The camera has one aerial shot, and then pulls to his viewpoint of the chaos and tragedy. The cinematography was beautiful and suited the tone for the time period. The score by Dario Marianelli really set the mood for the film. When something sad happened in the film, the music was sad. When something suspenseful happened, it was uplifting. However, I felt sometimes that the music may have been overdone in a few scenes. <br/><br/>The performances were wonderful. Keira Knightley is brilliant as Cecilia. There's no doubt that she'll get a second nomination for Best Actress. James McAvoy, whom I felt was perfect in The Last King of Scotland, was astonishing. Of the many scenes he was in the movie, the one scene that moved me most was when he comes upon a group of dead school children. It was a very emotional scene, but the tears in his eyes were even more moving. He should definitely get the Best Actor. <br/><br/>I can't forget to mention the supporting cast either. The three actresses who played Briony from Saoirse Ronan at 13, Romola Garai at 18, and Vanessa Redgrave at old age were all amazing. Of the three, I feel that Saorise Ronan did the best job. Unlike many child thespians, she was not rehearsed. I could easily understand her feelings and motives. <br/><br/>Overall, this was an excellent movie. This has not been the best year for movies like the last few years, but this is the best I have seen for this year. I can see at least ten Oscar nominations coming its way, including Best Picture. 10/10"
"jaredmobarak","10","5","8","28 December 2007"," No rhymes and no embellishmentsAtonement
","Ladies and gentlemen, a hand for director Joe Wright; he has crafted a masterpiece. With resemblances to films like Cold Mountain and A Very Long Engagement, Atonement is just so much more. Visually stunning, intellectually stimulating, and forever heartbreaking, Wright has made a movie like no other this year. Sure I have seen ""perfect"" films this year, for lack of a better word, but even Gone Baby Gone winds up far down the list when compared to all 10/10 films I've seen and given that mark to. This is the first film all year that I can truly say is something I will buy and share with everyone I know. I can only imagine how much greater Ian McEwan's novel upon which this is based can be. From the start right on until the end, we are shown a glimpse into the lives of the Tallis family and those surrounding them. It is a time of social status and proper manners, an era led along by its rules and prejudices. For a young girltoo naïve and innocent to fully grasp what it is she seesthat world is a very dangerous playground.<br/><br/>The backbone of the tale lies in the fact that everyone sees events and history through their own eyes. What is the truth anyway? Unless you are privy to every second of an occurrence, from its cause to its effect, you can never really comprehend if that which you saw was real, and even then it is a very fine line to walk. Atonement is at all times playing with this notion, showing us sequences from the eyes of the viewer and than again through those of the participants. Whereas the two lovers are afraid to let slip their social faux-pas of a relationship outside of classes, the accuser is so set in the warped truth she believes that to think about the situation objectively is not at the front of her mind.<br/><br/>It is amazing how one moment in time can so utterly devastate the lives of all involved. The consequences of which can never be imagined until years later after they have already occurred. Between Robbie having to go to jail and than join the army in WWII for a crime he did not commit, (it is tough to watch his return to the house with the two young twins that he had been out trying to find, totally oblivious to the crime that transpired while he was gone), and his love Cecilia Tallis losing the one thing she didn't know she even had until a couple hours before, it is tough to believe the orchestrator of all that sorrow would have it even worse. Cecilia's sister Briony did what she thought was right, led into a lie by the victim herself, and she would have to live with that regret and guilt for the rest of her life, without any means to vindicate herself or make amends. I don't even know if what she did could honestly ever be forgiven; her sheltered aristocratic upbringing and wild storytelling imagination can be held accountable. The times are at fault too for holding the weak words of a 13-year-old as fact against an inferior servant boy, no matter how much a part of the family he had become or how educated he was.<br/><br/>Despite all the support it is the lead characters that carry this film. Keira Knightley is amazing as Cecilia, growing out of her groomed lifestyle to be with the man she knows she has always loved. The pain she must express and the hurt her love causes herself is believable at every turn. I will admit to never seeing all the hype with her as an actress, but that opinion has totally been wiped away. As for Robbie, the man at the heart of it all, James McAvoy has really come into his own. Sure he has been great in previous work, even stealing scenes from Oscar winner Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland, but it is his portrayal here that shows his true worth. Knowing his place in society, he accepts his fate. Only when he finds out a few years later that his love was not a tenuous one is he allowed to breakdown and fight to survive. The scene where he meets Briony again many years after that fateful night is powerful to experience as emotions run high and wild. All three actors in that scene deliver.<br/><br/>Not to be overshadowed, director Joe Wright deserves a lot of praise and credit too. His handling of the material is impeccable and the end result glorious to behold. From the editing style, showing us all viewpoints of every situation, to the sweeping crane shots following characters, to the brilliant performances he gets out of all involved, Wright has a steady hand and complete control. The film would be a top ten candidate as a result of just two sequences, even if the rest were trash. When the war hits Briony's hospital, the montage of carnage, grief, and compassion is overwhelming, however, it is the arrival of Robbie and his two friends at Dunkirk that takes the prize. This elaborate long take is absolutely astonishing. It begins with their arguing to a superior about getting back home, going on to the slaughter of horses and automobiles, a group of men singing, some men on an amusement park ride, losing the three men to eventually join up with them again as they rejoin each other at the bar across the way, ending on an all encompassing view of the chaos on the beach. Stunning to behold, that scene sums up the whole film with its artistry and attention to detail. Complete with a startling revelation at its conclusion, I can't think of a better word than perfect for when I am ever asked what I thought of the film."
"Litnfilm","10","5","8","16 December 2007"," They Did It!!
","For anyone interested in seeing Atonement on the screen, you must start with reading the book. It is so beautifully written and the author, Ian McEwan, lays out for the reader what it is like to have the attention of an audience and the responsibility that entails. However, if you don't have time to read it, you will get a very close adaptation. Under the clever direction of Joe Wright and with an intricate score by Dario Marianelli, the book is fully realized on the screen and as a viewer you will be rewarded. Wonderful performances were given by all actors involved. The chemistry between Knightly and McAvoy is a character unto itself. Even the small role of Brenda Blethyn as housekeeper is a powerful performance that deserves much praise. What a struggle to see such wonderfully written novels not given the credit they are due on the big screen. It is very apparent with Atonement that everyone involved with the film understood the sentiment of the book and has done it justice. Hardly a stuffy period piece, Atonement is a house filled with intrigue and harsh realities. Enjoy!"
"mariadepool","10","5","8","16 December 2007"," Great film!!!!
","It is poetry and beauty made film, it should be enjoyed in a movie theater, not at home. Just sit down, relax and let yourself go with this great experience of intelligent and excellent film making. This is what this business should be all about, great movies with a wonderful script, characters well described, and impossible-to-improve acting. This young director has a clear mind of how to make good movies, every little detail is taken care of, every set it better than the previous one. Is just amazing how a well written story does not have to tell you the day, the year, the exact location... this is all superfluous to what the characters are going through. James McAvoy is the soul and the center of it all, he is the ultimately perfect leading man. May be a little slow for those impatient, helicopter-exploding movie fans, it suits better with a mature audience."
"pratikshathanki","9","5","8","4 December 2007"," Atonement shows a bleak but beautiful side of life
","When we say something is full of life, we generally take it in a very lively, happy sense. I want to use the same term for Atonement. But in a different way. Yes, Atonement is full of life. But not just with in a usual positivity. It has life throbbing through every moment with all passion melting in bitterness, confusion, guilt, rage and repentance. A story set in suffocating British aristocracy has a romance brewing with Cecilia, the elder daughter of an aristocrat and extra-ordinarily talented Robbie, son of his servant. But the confusion and misunderstanding of the younger daughter Briony messes up all their lives by accusing Robbie of the crime he never committed. As the world is on the brink of the world war and as a prisoner Robbie chooses to fight in the war. On the other hand, Cecilia still carries her emotions for Robbie intact in her heart. Life is tough for these two, but not as much as Briony who realizes the consequences of her mistakes and tries to repent by giving up normal comforts. But what is undone remains so. Cecilia and Robbie have a hope that if the war ends soon, they will be able to reunite. Briony wishes that too as she has been the reason behind creating the mayhem. However, the wishes never materialize as Robbie and Cecilia lose their lives in the war, leaving Briony to find the only possible way to bring them together, the fictional way. As she grows old, towards the end of her life, she writes a semi-autobiographical novel where in the end, Cecilia and Robbie get to live happily ever after... The first and the most marvelous aspect of the movie is the way it is shot. The way water sinks into sand at the Redcar beach freezes that frame into your cinematic memories...The English country side and the life in contrast to the war tapestry in the second half simply exhibits remarkable film-making skills. The acting complements the technicalities. The screenplay and the flow of story telling in this medium is flawless to an extent that I wonder Ian McEwan's book could have made Robbie's suffering and hallucinations of the night before his death more poignant. Being a movie buff in Europe has advantages, I could at least watch a just released English film even before it released in the US..... Just like most of the world that has seen Atonement, I'm also waiting for how many Oscar nominations it gets."
"Superunknovvn","8","5","8","3 December 2007"," The Oscar movie of 2008
","This is Oscar material. Best Picture material to be exact. That's not necessarily saying that ""Atonement"" is something special. It is a beautiful film based on a very sad novel. Direction and stage design are solid, as are the performances. And that's about the most that can be said about this movie. It's just a classic Oscar contender in the vein of ""The Cider House Rules"", but doesn't really have many new things to offer conceptually or visually. There's one really masterful long tracking shot in the movie, but actually I thought it was kind of unnecessary, as if it had just been there for the director of photography to show off a bit.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound too negative, though, as this movie is actually very good and totally worthwhile seeing. Still, if you're looking for more original films that came out this year, you'd be better off seeing ""Across The Universe"" or ""Into The Wild""."
"cathgoof","9","5","8","22 September 2007"," Beautiful film
","This film has stayed with me since I saw it last week and I think it will for a long time. It is visually and emotionally beautiful, and demands your attention from the very start. I have read other books by Ian McEwan but not Atonement - and I am now apprehensive of reading it for fear it will not live up to the film (and as someone who 1. is usually unimpressed by Keira Knightley and 2. really rates Ian McEwan's other novels, that is high praise indeed)! Keira does well, all actors involved are well cast, but James McAvoy utterly steals the show. A stunning performance, and one that should warrant an Oscar nomination. You cannot help but fall in love with his character, and although understated he will, in turn, make you smile, swoon, laugh out loud, and weep. The cinematography backs up his performance wonderfully, the Dunkirk scene lives up to the hype, and the music is great. Extremely impressive film."

""Well son, let's go watch 'Atonement' and you can see for yourself.""<br/><br/>Coming into ""Atonement,"" I was expecting a sort of Jane Austin wartime romance with a slight twinge of sadness; not what is widely considered to be the dirtiest word in the English language typed in eight-foot letters across the screen followed by Chester Molester in all his creeptacular glory.<br/><br/>To briefly flesh out why ""Atonement"" is so dissatisfying, imagine if ""Titanic"" had some sort of malnourished lovechild with ""Romeo and Juliet."" He would be the tragic kid no one understands, receiving pity-laughs aplenty due to his darkly-awkward socially faux-pas behaviour while constantly make everyone uncomfortable and confused; his name would be ""Atonement."" All this being said, upon leaving the theatre I caught myself wondering if it would be morally wrong to ask the manager for a refund, or if he could possibly compensate me for the portion of my life I lost amidst awkwardly laughing and searching through the quagmire that had played out before me for a plot. I decided against this, seeing as no one coerced me into paying for the film, coupled with the fact that I didn't want to waste anymore time that evening.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see eight foot profanities flashed repeatedly across the screen dashed with a hefty dose of molestation and misunderstanding while leaving feeling confused and vacuous, or if you really don't value your money and time then ""Atonement"" is the movie for you!"

"MaxBorg89","9","8","15","9 December 2007"," Cruel, touching and utterly brilliant
","Teenage angst, war, love, regret, redemption and the power of words: all these themes are beautifully tied together in Atonement, which is quite simply one of the best literary adaptations of all time. It is so good, in fact, that I feel compelled to discourage viewers from reading the book before they see the movie, as Ian McEwan's striking, audacious prose is impossible to resist, but will also lessen the impact of the most shocking film epilogue I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Much more adult than director Joe Wright's previous pairing with Keira Knightley (Pride & Prejudice), Atonement is quite similar to Capote in its analysis of the writing process and the sacrifices the author has to make. The author in question is Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year old who is going to have her cousins perform a play she has written, the occasion being a dinner party at the family estate in the British countryside (the year is 1935). During the preparations, she notices the sexual tension between her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) and gardener Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) and misinterprets certain signals, leading to a pretty big lie that ruins the evening and destroys the young lovers' future.<br/><br/>The film then cuts to World War II, deftly moving from a Merchant-Ivory England to a ravaged France, where Robbie is stationed and forced to witness atrocities every day, his only consolation being the hope that he will meet Cecilia again some day. Back in London, instead, both of the Tallis sisters work as nurses, albeit completely isolated from one another, leaving Briony (Romola Garai) with plenty of time to think about her mistake and plan what to say, should all three ever happen to be in the same room one last time.<br/><br/>Although I said this is primarily a movie about writing, another key theme that never leaves the picture is a painful reflection on lost youth, evident in the casting choices: almost all the roles are played by twenty-somethings (the more adult parts, like Brenda Blethyn's cameo, are so brief they barely matter), and every single scene focuses on either Briony, Cecilia or Robbie, emphasizing how one little event altered three lives radically. Such attention to character requires good acting, and the performances are all equally superb: McAvoy, sad and angry, carries the film's second half with no fatigue at all, Knightley is dark, complex and very sensual in her first adult role, and the Ronan/Garai duo embody the young scribbler's ambition and ingenuousness with impressive sincerity.<br/><br/>Every bit as seductive are the visuals, further proof of the great eye Wright had displayed on Pride and Prejudice. None of the beautiful sequences, however, are there merely for their own sake, each and every one of them, even when evoking the director's previous work (the fog and rain look very familiar), having the purpose of setting a specific mood, a task in which they succeed at all times. One sequence in particular blends Wright's unique visual style with the impenetrable sadness he intends to convey: a five-minute tracking shot that follows Roobie's walk on a French beach amongst mutilations, deaths and overall suffering. Not since Scorsese followed Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco through the Copacabana's rear entrance has a long take stuck in my memory with the same intensity. Also notable is the movie's only sex scene which, no matter how tender, leaves an omen of tragedy in the air, making the tormented love story even more excruciating to watch.<br/><br/>And yet, for all the great thesping, editing and lensing, Atonement is, fundamentally, a story about the impact of the written word. The best writers are those who manage to trigger contrasting feelings in the reader, often simultaneously, which is why the bold, relentlessly cruel epilogue (featuring a priceless Vanessa Redgrave as the aged Briony) is so moving and infuriating in its controlled manipulation of what has just been seen. A masterpiece."
"kari_d","8","3","4","6 November 2008"," Enjoyed it more than the book!
","I was actually very surprised I liked this movie so much. I didn't think the book was that fantastic (not very memorable). I thought the acting was great and the filming superb. The whole time my husband and I were thinking ""That stupid girl"" (and I kind of hate that feeling). I enjoyed it more than he did. I agree with another poster that this is Keira's best performance. I'm not a huge fan, but she did great and didn't annoy me (thrown back shoulders and turned out arms aside). This was her best role. I really liked McAvoy. He is simply a fantastic actor in just about everything I've seen him in. It was a little long, but I'm glad it went into the depth it did in the beginning to give a sense of history and background. A great film."
"Niv-1","9","3","4","26 August 2008"," One of the strongest movies of 07

Seriously you didn't even need her tremendous speech because it's all in her body language. Garai is great during and after her encounter with the french soldier as well as the apartment scene. The praise for Ronan doesn't capture how good and natural she is. Knightley was fine but doesn't rate with any of the Briony's or McAvoy.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the movie is remarkable. Not only for the stunning tracking shot but for when Briony goes into the library. The way the light comes off that hair thing and then the lamp.<br/><br/>The script was a very good adaptation of the book and the direction of Wright couldn't be better."

","I am not a fan of love stories; in fact, this movie was not my first choice to see this year. I fully admit that my girlfriend dragged me to this movie, and I dug my heels in since I had no desire to see it. In the end, I'm glad I relented because it is one of the better movies that I have seen in a long time. After watching it my first thought was, ""Finally, a realistic love story."" I have two pet peeves when it comes to movies: happy endings and love always triumphing over all. In small doses these are okay, but put together, as they are in 99 times out of 100, it is a bit sickening. This movie was the one in a hundred to have the tenacity to be realistic and is worth every minute for it. While some would argue that movies should be designed to escape reality for some time, most love stories take this too far, and the lovers end up together regardless of the situation. That is not the case with this movie, and it is refreshing to escape the sappiness that most movies offer for the harshness of the movie. The abrupt and sudden change of pace that the movie offers shocks you at the core, and reminds you that movies can be a form of art. Yes, the movie is a bit slow at certain points, however, this is easy enough to overlook once it comes together in the end. I walked away from this movie not thinking about the slow points, but rather focusing on the intense feelings I experienced and the fulfillment of my wish of a realistic ending. While this will be called a ""Chick Flick"" by most men, and dismissed by many for this reason, it should not be in any way. Take a chance and watch this movie gentlemen, you will not be disappointed. Well, unless you insist on the unrealistic happy endings with love always triumphing over all."

You would like to think that it's complete, but after what has happened it can never be. There is humor. There is mystery. There is romance. There are twists and turns, and there is heartbreak.<br/><br/>It is not everyday that you come across something as powerful as ""Atonement"", and when you do it's something that carries you out of your seat and blows you away, leaving you awestruck at the sheer beauty of it all as the credits roll..."

","""Atonement"" tells a story of a young girl (Saoirse Ronan) who witnesses a terrible thing which changes many lives dramatically. What is real and what is the truth? ""Atonement"" plays with these subjects.<br/><br/>Joe Wright has directed a brilliant drama where beautiful scenery and great story play the biggest part. The brilliant novel by Ian McEwan is fitted to the silver screen fantastically. The suspense is holding you tight in its grip. The music supports the movie and gives a delightful touch to the storytelling. The cast especially James McAvoy as Robbie and young and talented Saoirse Ronan as Briony deliver their roles with such a presence. The appearance of Vanessa Redgrave is great also. The episodic scene technique was imaginative and very mind-teasing which was a very essential ingredient to the plot.<br/><br/>It was very surprising that director Wright didn't get a Oscar nomination for his achievement. The screenplay of Christopher Hampton also lost in the Academy Awards. Both Wright and Hampton did a superb job. But this was clearly a year of the Coen brothers, very well earned of course. Gladly Dario Marianelli won the Golden Statue for best achievement in music.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" is a clever, beautiful, emotional and touching experience. Definitely a worth watching!"
"CountZero313","10","3","4","26 April 2008"," he sleeps so deeply
","My generation grew up on the novels of Ian McEwan. As undergraduates, we ate up the illicit thrills of First Love, Last Rites and The Cement Garden. We reveled in the delicious viciousness of The Comfort of Strangers. It crescendo-ed with the cathartic joy of life, death and re-birth in The Child in Time. Nothing lasts, of course, and Black Dogs, Amsterdam, and Enduring Love all failed to scale previous heights. We smiled indulgently at the dabble with children's literature. This list isn't comprehensive, but you get the point - there was a distinct cooling off between McEwan and his public.<br/><br/>And then along came Atonement. An incredible, startling return to form that ripped your heart out.<br/><br/>Film adaptations of McEwan have hardly set the heather on fire. I approached Atonement the movie aware of all the plaudits, but expecting, at best, a decent-ish bastardization of the novel. Instead, the film achieves the cathartic heights of its source material. McAvoy is outstanding, the weight of injustice chiselled on his every expression. The technical aspects of the film are superb, the Dunkirk extended steadicam shot both outrageous and aesthetically appropriate. The score is playful but serious, in perfect harmony with McEwan's devastating conceit.<br/><br/>McEwan fans will appreciate the elliptical structure, rewinding of time, flash backs and flash forwards. Having said that, my Japanese viewing partner had not read the novel but appreciated the film immensely.<br/><br/>For some odd reason, The Child in Time, McEwan's best novel, remains unfilmed. I sincerely hope the people responsible for Atonement will one day turn their attention to that masterpiece."

That's the only minus i can think of in this movie. I think a few scenes could be left out and the movie wont lose anything at all. But if you know the history of great love stories on film, you know that the most of them are long flicks: Titanic, English patient etc. Which is understandable considering the fact that the viewers will get to know more of the main characters so it would be easier to feel the things the characters feel.<br/><br/>You'll feel sad but satisfied at the end of this movie.

"TxMike","Null","3","4","4 April 2008"," Epic period piece spanning 65 years, starting in the 1930s England.
","Atonement: compensation for a wrong.<br/><br/>The story is not always linear, but in total spans from around 1934 when Briony Tallis, future author, is around 11, to around 2000 when she is 77, dying, and announces that she has written her last of 21 novels. She says, in a real sense, it is her first since she began thinking of it since she was a young girl. <br/><br/>The movie is made mostly from Briony's perspective. Saoirse Ronan is Briony Tallis at age 13, living in a mansion in rural England in 1935. Her older sister is Keira Knightley as Cecilia Tallis. The third member of the ""love triangle"" is James McAvoy as Robbie Turner, son of the Tallis household's maid. He is treated much like a family member and even his schooling is financed by them. His mother is Brenda Blethyn as Grace Turner.<br/><br/>Briony is smart and demanding, and fashions herself as an author, writing her first play at 13. But she also is secretly in love with Robbie who just treats her as a younger sister. We see a flashback to when Briony was 11 or 12 (her words) and she jumps into a pond to have him ""save"" her.<br/><br/>But Robbie and Cecilia are the ones who really are falling in love with each other. Something happens at a fountain, Briony sees it from afar, doesn't understand what happened, and comes away with a bad feeling against Robbie, partly because in her young mind feels cheated by him. So, when something else comes up later that evening, she takes it out on Robbie and it has a lasting affect.<br/><br/>So the rest of the movie is about Briony eventually learning the truth, and doing what she can for atonement, trying to make right her wrong. Good movie, even touching on the conflicts in France in the early 1940s part of WW II. <br/><br/>August 2013 update: I just watched it again, it is better than I had remembered it, very good on repeat viewing.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Briony's wrong was naming Robbie as the man she saw that night apparently raping a teenage house guest in the field. As a result Robbie was imprisoned, and after 3 1/2 years got out only because he agreed to enlist in the Army and fight. So his and Cecilia's romance was effectively ended. But later Briony found that the ""rapist"" and the teenager got married, meaning it probably wasn't a rape at all. Unfortunately both Robbie and Cecilia, now a nurse, both died as a result of the war, but in ""atonement"" Briony gave them happiness and a life together in her final book, ""Atonement"", that was the only gift she could give to them, after their deaths."

","For these of my friends who I showed these others reviews I ever wrote, this may come off as an odd one only because this time it's nothing that I want to laugh about or point out necessarily in a review. Those previous ones have been written as a result of a sporadic burst of thought, which I would sometimes experience after watching a good film that would excite me. With ""Atonement"" its such a different case.<br/><br/>To my dear friend Alon Rosenblum, I wrote : <br/><br/>""I watched ""Atonement"" yesterday, just before the Oscars. When I reach back into that experience, while writing this, i get tears rolling in my eyes......I cried at the end....I cried on my way out of the theater....I cried in the car on my way back. And then I yelled, much later, because the movie didn't get its BEST FILM award.<br/><br/>I had 2 favorites last year that stood out, PAN'S LABYRINTH and THE LIVES OF OTHERS.<br/><br/>This year' its ""Atonement"", and there is no movie standing close to this amazing vision and pain that has been transferred thru images and sound directly into my soul. "" And that couldn't even touch the tip of the iceberg of what and how I felt. <br/><br/>""Atonement"" could not fit into my regular burst of desire to write because that movie took my hand and walked a path with me to remember. I couldn't lock onto one particular moment and devour it with words. Over 2 weeks later, at 12:30am of Saturday I felt like I should make an attempt to write a review I longed to write since watching the film itself. <br/><br/>It is a sad reality in the film world these days how rare truly good films come about. Either because of the abundance of available technology that sprung out in the last years which allowed too many painters too unpolished and yet ready to paint on the canvas...or be that the ones who forgot what movies are about, lost in their accounting and fame. However it is not of a surprise to me that this gem came out of England, the land of pristine acting and humble actors, the land of Harry Potter and tea at 5. A movie so human, real and touching to the core of everyone on all levels alike.<br/><br/>If you, dear reader, look at other reviews people wrote on IMDb, you may notice one similarity. People who hate it and people who love it, alike, will not stop talking about it for numerous paragraphs. <br/><br/>""Atonement"" is a story of many things and people. I think, from human standpoint, its a story about a person, Briony Tallis, who never knew how to stop creating worlds for herself in her writing as well as life. It amazed me, personally, how she never EVER changed throughout her entire life until the very end. How she had to replace and justify the false ending of her book, an action of which devoured her alive even after the book has been complete. A girl and woman alike, so trapped in their own world that the gravity of truth never applies. Briony turns into a study whereas she is a human being or a character in a book she needs to keep writing in order to live and therefore has the freedom to write her own reality. <br/><br/>It may not be for Cecilia and Robbie who were in love and wanted to be together, not the atrocities of war, not the death. It's nothing else to me, but the power of one's imagination and the fruit it bears. <br/><br/>Lost in her writing/life, the older Briony still voices out her concerns about the decisions she made for her sister and Robbie and their lives, writing them into a picture perfect home on the beach and shaving Robbie's facial hair as well as wrinkles and age off. One can't really say if she is in denial. Its only the shocking revelation of her secrets she kept and choices she made since young age, that make your hair stand still. And its even scarier when you see her old and same.<br/><br/>I cried and cried and didn't know why, at the end of the film. Was it because of the spectacular poetic acting by the entire cast without an exception. Was it because of the masterful hand of the director who created a movie so beautiful and strong. The music? Or the sadness, for Briony Tallis and her miserable life of a character-turned-ghost only because the real Briony never let herself exist outside of her own writing.<br/><br/>I would love to praise everyone involved, above to below the line, The Working Title and Focus Features, Joe Wright, the absolutely phenomenal performances by James McAvoy and Keira Knightley who maybe taught us what having a relationship with a character on screen is really about.<br/><br/>Personally, this year's Academy Awards lost their clout of being a judge of good and bad. It seemed like the traditional academy voters were replaced at the last moment by people who only like the cocktails, but not watching the nominated films. <br/><br/>""Atonement"" is the only film who can claim its title as ""BEST FILM OF THE YEAR"" and it remains to be, only because there was not a single day passing by when its name or plot did not come to my mind. <br/><br/>Exhilarating, Exceptional, Powerful and Unforgettable.<br/><br/>""Atonement"""

","One of my favourite films of 2007, this made a great impact on me when I saw it in the cinema, and watching clips screened on TV since only reminds me of the many highlights that it features. The storyline of the film is well-structured - based around a young girl's confused and spiteful reactions to her older sister's romance. Joe Wright as director subtly shifts styles, leading from the clipped and mannered 1930s through the upheavals of WW2, and on to the dramatic revelations in the sterile TV studio at the conclusion (delivered by the excellent Vanessa Redgrave). This is one of those films that makes terrific use of the wide screen, nowhere more so than in the excellent recreation of the soldiers' views of the long wait for evacuation from Dunkirk. Performances from the whole cast are very good, with James McAvoy in particular delivering what will hopefully be just one of many memorable roles to come. Highly recommended!"

It's a shoe-in for Best Original Score.<br/><br/>In the end, though, it's the heart-wrenching story that makes the film a masterpiece. As much mystery as it is romance 'Atonement' is never boring, but always changing and moving. And as far as endings go- this one is perfect, unlike anything I've ever seen. Whatever you do, don't spoil it for yourself! If 'No Country for Old Men' doesn't sweep the Oscars, it will probably be because 'Atonement' was right at its heels. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen while you still can! 8/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"barrys82","8","3","4","21 February 2008"," An epic movie, a real Oscar Contender
","Good movie, with lots of drama. Its the typical romantic film with betrayal, passion and tears. It also has some moments of mystery. The story is set around a forbidden romance, and how one lie from a young girl who misunderstands a series of situations not meant for her perception result in incomprehensible tragedy for three lives. The first hour of the movie is quite interesting, with a good rhythm, the next half hour turns to be a little slow almost to tiresome for my taste until the last half hour when all the issues begin to resolve. The movie set is amazingly recreated in its first part in the England of the late 30's and then in the early 40's on WWII. The cast is wonderful, Keira Knightley with an outstanding performance as Cecilia Tallis, James McAvoy also with a great acting job and Saoirse Ronan on an excellent role that deserve her a Oscar nomination. Definitely a good and interesting movie worth to see."
"jmbenishek","9","3","4","19 February 2008"," An almost flawless, visually arresting film (my review)
","When I read Ian McEwan's masterful novel, Atonement, upon its release, a film adaptation seemed unfathomable. McEwan's metafictional, multifaceted novel is a tour de force of (what I believed to be) inimitable depth. Here, screenwriter Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright turn McEwan's novel into an epic beauty with powerful acting, visual complexity and a story that is gracefully paced until rewarding its audience with an ending of moral consequence that many films often fail to deliver. <br/><br/>The film opens with young Briony Tallis, typing away at her typewriter a play named, The Trials of Arabella. At age 13, Briony has the mind, perseverance and imagination to become a successful writer. The film does not convey her peculiarities about writing in the same, playfully elegant way the novel does, but it still conveys her obsession and willpower. However, as her superficial play endeavors fall apart, the plot takes a turn. Briony is a witness to four key events that change the life of the story. <br/><br/>As Briony is in distress about her unsuccessful play, she looks out the window and catches her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) stripping down to her undergarments. Staring at her is Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the son of Briony's family's housekeeper. Briony is baffled and looks away for a second. This is the first of four reasons for Briony's imagination to run wild and believe that Robbie Turner is a sexual fanatic. <br/><br/>The second event is a mistake on Robbie's behalf: a note, written out of frustration for expressing his feelings about Cecilia is giving to Briony to give to Cecilia. It is too late when Robbie realizes that he handed Briony the frustration note, not the final draft. Third: a scene in the study convinces Briony that Robbie is a sex maniac. The final event is one of the crucial events of the story, and it is crucial to the theme of ""Atonement."" <br/><br/>While Wright shows both Briony's perspective and Robbie and Cecilia's to show the audience the different perspectives, it is easy to empathize with the young, imaginative Briony. Briony believes she is witnessing inappropriate sexuality, while Robbie and Cecilia are simple exploring their sexual curiosities. At first, it seems easy to assume that Briony is an evil girl, but she is simply an adolescent full of curiosity and a bit of frustration. Although Briony is the cause of dreadful things, she is not a despicable character by any means. <br/><br/>""Atonement"" is the type of film that could have easily been an overdone love story, but Wright turns Hampton's strong script into a story of love, war and loss. This film works on many levels, including: great acting, a great score by Dario Marianelli and flawless directing with one of the most unforgettable tracking shots in recent film history. <br/><br/>In the final sequence of the film, we meet Briony again, now much older, and promoting what is said to be her final novel, entitled Atonement. The audience learns what happened (or what could have happened) to Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis from the mind of the atoning novelist, Briony Tallis. The story told through Briony's character is a heartbreaking saga of the only thing she felt she could do to give herself the atonement and piece of mind she desperately needed."
"fdcraig","8","3","4","18 February 2008"," Stunning
","Beautifully shot, with stunning colours and exquisite tension at every crucial moment. I'm not a huge fan of Keira Knightley but she served well for this film. James McAvoy was a perfect as the wronged, restrained, but passionate lover (a travesty that he was robbed of an Oscar nomination). The double-backs to certain scenes and a brilliant score ensured that we were absorbed in this poignant masterpiece from beginning to end where we are met with a final heartbreaking twist.<br/><br/>Perhaps not a film with an abundance of underlying messages (immortalising the lovers in a book? That's not atonement. Call me a hopeless tragic but what she did could only generate a lifetime of suffering and regret, never atoned for.) Nevertheless, it is a beautiful work of art. Highly recommended."
"mjsinclair","8","3","4","18 February 2008"," Watery wartime soup
","Just as food was rationed in World War II, the watery-thin story line of this film is strung out and made to last for 130 minutes. There is simply not enough meat here, not enough to get your teeth into and I left the cinematic table still feeling hungry. <br/><br/>But setting the story aside, there is much to appreciate. The casting is perfect. Although good in the role, Keira Kightley's character doesn't have enough to do, and not enough to merit her Bafta nomination. James McAvoy is excellent, and a worthy contender for his nomination. But he has no chance against the towering performance of Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"" this time around  his time will surely come. Vanessa Redgrave makes an appearance at the very end of the film, and spends 10 minutes or so in close up. Using every nuance of her facial expression, she is wonderfully moving. <br/><br/>Wartime England is fastidiously recreated, with meticulous attention to detail, and with remarkable authenticity. I really felt like I was there. The cinematography and art direction are exquisite, as are the costumes, and easily merit their Oscar nominations. <br/><br/>It seemed to me as though 90% of the budget was spent on one scene; on the beaches of Dunkerque, an enormous sprawling set with thousands of extras, where the camera wanders around and through the activities of the soldiers (not sure why?). it goes on forever. Perhaps they had some cash left in the budget and so decided to splash out on a ""big"" scene. Big it is, and painstakingly created, but it is to my mind also superfluous; visual padding to compensate for the inadequate storyline. <br/><br/>There was a wartime joke in England: ""If this is chicken soup, then the chicken must have walked through it on stilts"". That just about sums it up. <br/><br/>This is watery soup served in an exquisite hand-painted porcelain bowl"
"gelman@attglobal.net","9","3","4","17 February 2008"," Movie captures spirit of McEwan's Great Novel
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS Ian McEwan's ""Atonement"" blew me out of the water when I read it shortly after publication. It was better than any other novel I've read in the past 25 years. Although it changes certain details, the movie captures the essence of the novel: the tragedy caused by a 13-year-old girl with a vivid imagination, wrecking the lives of her older sister and her young lover. With Saoirse Ronan as Brioni, the 13 year old, Keira Knightley as Cecilia, the older sister, and James MacAvoy as Robby, the young man sent to prison as a result of Brioni's misidentification of him as a rapist, the movie gets off to a swift start and hurls along with the outbreak of World War II, the British retreat at Dunkirk and the bombing of London where both Cecilia and Brioni (now played at 18 by Ramola Garai) are both working as nurses. The shock at the end of the novel is also delivered by the film. Keira Knightley, James MacAvoy and Saoirse Ronan capture their characters perfectly in the early part of the movie when the beginning of the tragedy unfolds. The second part of the film is a bit less satisfactory, partly because McEwan's description of the retreat to Dunkirk was considerably more vivid than what the film is able to show -- possibly because it would have taken greater resources to capture the sweep of McEwan's narrative. The London scenes also suffer because the novel concentrated on the Cecilia-Robby story line whereas the film focuses to a greater extent on the older Brioni (and Garai is a much less compelling actress than Ronan). Still, considering the eventual outcome, the choices made by Joe Wright, the director, and by the screen writer are defensible. The story, after all, is Brioni's in the end. However, whereas ""Atonement"" was a great novel, in my opinion the film version -- despite superior cinematography and excellent acting --is merely very good."
"3xHCCH","9","3","4","17 February 2008"," The Classic Epic of 2007!
","This is the fourth of the Oscar Best Picture nominees I watched. Compared to the other three, this movie is the one where I come out feeling that Oscar is written all over it. This is the one with the elegant epic feel, reminiscent of past Oscar winner ""The English Patient"".<br/><br/>This is where cinematography (by Seamus Mc Garvey) is a key star element. All the scenes were meticulously composed shot like a special painting on a moving canvas. So many breathtaking and sweeping landscapes. Even the scenes depicting the horrors of war were imbued with artistic insight. So many vivid portraits as well with penetrating pain and anguish.<br/><br/>This is where the musical score (by Dario Marianelli) harks back to bygone grandiosity, like many past Oscar winners. Yet the tension in the music is uniquely heightened by the sound of typewriters typing. This ties in neatly with the story as the central character is a writer.<br/><br/>The story begins with Briony Tallis (an Oscar nominated Saoirse Ronan), a fanciful 13 year old girl who loves to write. She had just read a lustfully-worded love letter by the son of their household help Robbie (James McAvoy) to her sister Cee (Keira Knightley) and actually caught them in a compromising situation in the library. That night, as an assault is perpetrated on a guest in their opulent household. Briony accuses Robbie as the culprit and thus he is brought to jail. This part of the movie felt like ""Gosford Park."" <br/><br/>The second part of the movie traces how the love story of Cee and Robbie progressed through the war years four years after the arrest. Robbie was released from jail when he decided to join the army. Cee becomes a nurse. However, Robbie gets sent to France and they continue to communicate their love through letters. This part of the movie felt like ""Cold Mountain"" and ""A Very Long Engagement."" <br/><br/>I felt the third and last part of this story is the one that gives it its defining characteristic and twist. The story goes back to Briony, now 18 (Romola Garai). She is now fully cognizant of her erroneous accusation and its tragic effects. She gives up her slot at Cambridge and becomes a nurse as well. She seeks out Robbie and her sister in order to atone for her past sins. And just when you thought it is all over, Briony comes back again, this time in the present (Vanessa Redgrave) in an epilogue with more to tell us.<br/><br/>I am not surprised that this film had already won the Golden Globe and the British Academy Awards for Best Picture. I feel that its chance for the Oscar for Best Picture may be compromised by the fact that its Director Joe Wright was not nominated. I am not surprised why its lead stars McAvoy and Knightley were not nominated. While they maybe the bigger stars, in the story, they play support to the main story of the Briony character. While this film had its flaws, particularly its derivative feel in a greater part of the story as I have already indicated. But so far in its totality, among all the nominees I have watched, this is my favored one for Best Picture of 2008."
"ssteele86","9","3","4","13 February 2008"," Beautiful
","I found this to be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen! Although ultimately tragic, this film drew me in from the beginning and held my attention throughout. The amazing chemistry of the actors made this a believable film and truly brought these characters to life. I am generally not a great fan of Knightly however, in this film she shines. I also found that the plot was unanticipated but convincing and captured most of the audience through the film. Although not what I expected from the advertisements, I found this film to be both thought-provoking and beautiful. A must see for anyone who enjoys absolutely beautiful films that are not a cookie-cutter image of today's Hollywood."
"jpschapira","9","3","4","11 February 2008"," ""Our story will resume...""
","I always recall Roger Ebert's comment on Anna Paquin's character in ""The Piano"". He says she plays a little girl who is intentionally mischievous; who sees things and uses them to hurt others. Well, there's a little girl in ""Atonement"", called Briony (the intense 14-year-old Saoirse Ronan), who's exactly the opposite: she reads something, she witnesses something and makes a mistake that will chase her for the rest of her life. <br/><br/>It's England in the 30's; formality and distance between one person and another are the basis of Ian McEwan's famous novel; what Briony witnesses are two young people bursting in love and passion as you didn't see every day during those times, but how could she understand? And she drives Robbie (James McAvoy) and her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) away. He ends up in a war, she whispers ""come back to me"", he writes ""the story can resume, our story can resume""; we wait. <br/><br/>However, this is not the ""Cold Mountain"" storyline in which the blue knight has to face impossible obstacles to get to his princess, no. These are two lives that have fallen apart and before they did they sat together in a family table full of unspoken secrets, sexual tension and disappearances, all in one single day. And the little girl experienced too much in such a short period of time: too much to take for a joyful soul, writer of plays full of fantasies. ""Atonement"" is also the little girl's story, we come to realize; and in a way, the story of every individual present that night when everything collapsed. <br/><br/>Joe Wright teams up with Keira Knightley again after ""Pride & Prejudice"" and I can't help comparing both pieces. I was expecting at least something better, but ""Atonement"" makes Wright's screen debut seem like a piece of broken glass in the floor you don't want to step on. The appropriate, correct direction it's gone; characters don't seem like puppets with final destinations anymore. <br/><br/>There's a creative turn this time around, with the British director worried about the camera work (Seamus McGarvey brilliantly inspiring cinematography); a work of immense proportions that shows affection for the characters it's shooting. When you watch ""Pride & Prejudice"" you say: ""how beautiful this looks"", and it stops there; when watching ""Atonement"" you say: ""how beautiful it looks and how powerful it is"". I think Wright has done something more powerful than what he imagines. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley may not live up to her work as Elizabeth Bennett, but she is perfect and looks beautiful in a completely different character with more strength. And James McAvoy takes another huge step; you may want to watch ""The last King of Scotland"" and then thisWhat a leading man! I'll say no more. Maybe it's the novel: how different it is from Jane Austen's beloved tale and how well Christopher Hampton adapted it, covering the time changes and the different stages of life it goes through. <br/><br/>Dario Marianelli's score, unnoticeable in 'Prejudice', is definitely present here; loud, clear and meaningful although a little repetitive if you pay attention. Now that I mention repetition, if you think the film abuses of flashbacks, you are right; but it has a purpose. You see, every flashback is from 'that day' and 'that night' and, in different moments, each of the main characters relive the events in their own way.<br/><br/>Take the little girl as an example. I mentioned above that she makes a mistake that haunts her lifeBut she thought she was doing the right thing! Then she grows up, and when we see her as an old lady, portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave in a heartbreaking final speech, we wonder: How long does it take for someone to realize the wrong they have done? And everything that question means."
"brenttraft","9","3","4","1 February 2008"," Daring and Challenging for a Mainstream Film
","I had put off seeing ""Atonement"" because it looked like so many epic romance films that came before it.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised. This is a film that takes a lot of chances. First and foremost is the narrative structure. Some of the scenes are shown out of sequence. Some of the scenes are shown twice and from different points of view. And some scenes, we later find out, never really happened.<br/><br/>For the most part, we are not told any of this, so you really have to pay attention and think about what is going on. Unlike most films these day, you cannot passively watch this film.<br/><br/>In addition, the film is carried by young Saoirse Ronan who dominates the screen whenever she is on. The other actors are good, but Miss Ronan's performance is really special.<br/><br/>The directing also takes a lot of chances with lots of close ups and camera angles. The music is memorable and incorporates a typewriter as a musical instrument. It reminds me a lot of the film music of Phillip Glass.<br/><br/>If you have been avoiding ""Atonement"" because you thought you had seen it all before, think again. This is one of the most daring and experimental mainstream films to come out in a long time."
"bertseymour7","8","3","4","31 January 2008"," Great Movie... with a few problems
","The first 45-50 minutes of this film were absolutely beautiful. Had the film just been released as that I would have perhaps loved it more. The director Wright is certainly coming into his own and I am anticipating all of his upcoming films. Saoirse Ronan was wonderful as the young Briony, her performance really impressed me, especially considering she is so young, her academy award nomination was very much deserved and not at all one of those nominations that is just tagged onto an epic film to make it look better. I think I can almost even say that once her part in the film is over nothing quite holds up as well.<br/><br/>I guess this is mainly why I feel the film is disjointed, we spend the first 45 minutes of the movie exploring ONE single day, then we breeze through the final hour or so of the film and cover a span of several decades. So we go from the minute exploration of the details of a day to the cliffs notes of the rest of everyone else's life.<br/><br/>This film was around 2 hours and really should have been right at 3 hours, I felt so much was left unsaid and unexplored, the pace for the first hour indicated that you were in for an English Patient type of film and yet at some point the filmmakers decided not to be so bold with this project.<br/><br/>Speaking of the English Patient, I am a film scholar and the director of the English Patient shows up near the end of this film in a small role and that completely took me out of this film. All I could think of was why did they put Anthony Minghella in this film? I mean I know I shouldn't have been so distracted but I was.<br/><br/>This films marketing came in completely wrong, it seemed arrogant, all of the magazine interviews only focused on how it was believed that this film would rack up 14 Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>But all said and done I still believe this film is worthy of its Best Picture Nomination, and of the nominees I might almost consider it the best, although There Will Be Blood was quite interesting.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: See it."

"jazzcorporation","3","12","25","24 October 2007"," Great book shame about the film.
","There are so many glaring flaws in this film it is hard to know where to begin. It is disjointed and lacks any sense of organic development. It fails because it tries to cram an expansive novel into a two-hour film. The romantic connection between the lead characters seems to be based on little more than a tacky and frankly uncomfortable looking shag against a bookcase. There is not enough time to flesh out their relationship and we are left with James McEvoy's cheeky but lovable Scottish lad shtick and Keira Knightley's flawless skin and Merchant Ivory method acting routine.<br/><br/>The action lurches to France for an inexplicably drawn out scene showing that war really isn't very nice. Laughably, Robbie ruefully explains that he couldn't be an officer because he has been in prison. So let me get this right; war is horrible, but only so far as it imperils a cheeky but lovable Scottish lad who deserves better than those hundreds of thousands of unwashed grunts dying in the service of their country! <br/><br/>For the pièce de résistance, they wheel out the trusty Vanessa Redgrave for another dial-a-cameo performance. Sorry, but even the great VR needs more time to create suspension of disbelief. Before you can say, ""look it's what's 'er name Vanessa Redgrave"" she's blasted her way through the clip-on denouement and we're into the credits. And not before time."

I can become again the man who once crossed the surrey park at dusk, in my best suit, swaggering on the promise of life. The man who, with the clarity of passion, made love to you in the library. The story can resume. I will return. Find you, love you, marry you and live without shame."" <br/><br/>Joe Wright's Atonement is a beautiful and imaginative film that deftly succeeds at being a perfect adaptation of Ian McEwan's psychologically involving book of the same name. Using every ounce of engaging story available, Wright tackles the film's themes with a confidence considerably rare for such a relatively new director.<br/><br/>Towards the beginning of the film, Briony Tallis, an imaginative, yet foolish 13-year-old girl, bares witness to Robbie Turner making love with her older sister and then misinterprets a horrible crime she thinks she understands. Due to her naivety, she falsely accuses Robbie of the crime because of his earlier actions. Through her misguided convictions of the truth, she separates Robbie from Cecelia. The tale continues as Cecelia becomes a nurse and waits for Robbie to return from the war.<br/><br/>Christopher Hampton, the screenwriter, quite skillfully adapts the novel into a poignant screenplay. His ability to transform the pages into moving art and transitioning perspectives without sacrificing the pace or emotion of the source material is stunning.<br/><br/>Joe Wright excels even further after directing his first film, the spirited, yet simpler ""Pride and Prejudice"". His direction in Atonement is absolutely phenomenal, from the insanely brilliant single-take tracking shot through Dunkirk (perhaps one of the most beautiful and impeccably detailed scenes in film history) to the incredibly erotic and smart sex scene. His ability to deftly and brilliantly portray the most thorough and complex of emotions without the slightest of words being spoken is incredible.<br/><br/>Assisting the direction suitably is the seamless cinematography. The decoration and meticulous attention to detail throughout the entirety of the film wonderfully captures the feel and look of each location. The visuals constantly heighten the mood and perception of the story to the point where it feels as though the characters and circumstances of the tale were anything but endearingly human and complex creations of a clever mind.<br/><br/>The acting complements the visual prowess of the film perfectly. Saoirse Ronan and James McAvoy are particular standouts in an already top-notch cast. McAvoy instills in his character all the underlying emotions and exhaustion flawlessly. Ronan's talent shines through as she plays a character so complex and naive, the frustration and anger she makes the viewer feel towards her character defines extraordinary acting.<br/><br/>On top of everything else, the score is hauntingly breathtaking, from the melodic strikes of the typewriter keys to the melancholic piano and the mournful violin. The music enriches the scenes with an infectious beauty and sadness.<br/><br/>Joe Wright is a master storyteller and Atonement is an unforgettably brilliant, incredibly emotional film that deserves any sort of accolades it receives. It is one of only a very few films I have ever seen that I am proud to say is thoroughly without fault throughout its entirety."
"martin-ortiz","10","4","6","9 December 2008"," Human nature at its best
","Atonement tells a story, not a typical world war story. The war is there, no case trying to ignore it, but it is only the frame for this masterpiece, watching it makes us remember there were times in which upper social classes determined the destiny of those less lucky.<br/><br/>This movie portraits our innate tendency to gain control, our human impulse to impose our will regardless the effects it may have on others.<br/><br/>Briony is still a girl about to begin its journey through puberty, her inner perverse thoughts seem to come out after the sleeping period which is childhood. Young Briony is no fool, and finds a way to maintain her desires dormant. Robbie the object of her desire is unreachable, and not only that but he is also naive in believing Briony's purity and rightfulness.<br/><br/>The conflict begins when it becomes noticeable that Robbie loves (and lusts)Cecilia, Briony's older sister. And as you may predict, feelings are intense and unbearable for the younger sister. Just like in real life, control is set by the Machiavelical thinkers, not by the innocent and well intended.<br/><br/>Atonement is nothing short from being a Greek tragedy in which defying destiny brings terrible consequences. Cecilia and Robbie should have known that a Love that intense would only destroyed them, Society warned them it was not for them to decide, that the rules were pretty clear, they would not be together.<br/><br/>Great performances transmit exactly what is meant to be transmitted, Love is not enough, not in this world; on the contrary the world conspires against those who show that which most of us do not have, mutual unconditional love.<br/><br/>During the last couple of years the film industry has not been as appealing as before, at least that is the word on the street. What is the case of having 200 mediocre movies when you only get a handful of movies that are really worth reflecting on. I honestly think that Atonement is part of this select group."
"m_shankar20","8","4","6","23 June 2008"," A Labor of Love
","Atonement is a labor of love. Each frame of this film is crafted with patience and diligence. You can almost see the storyboard sketches that went into creating what you see on screen. There are some amazing shots which, in fact, the film could have done without while still retaining the quality that it has. But that the makers chose to work hard even on those scenes tells about their attention to detail. For instance, the scene where the Robbie (James McAvoy) is walking with his two fellow soldiers and there is a reflection of the fighter plane on the water canal.<br/><br/>The sequence of the army base/camp at the sea shore is amazing. It is the most elaborately designed and executed shot I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Besides the technical brilliance, the film rides on a very strong script and good performances. Briony Tallis' guilt is the center along which the story revolves. The love between Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie is complex. The duration that their love is latent is longer than it is actually expressed. Even more longer is the period where it survives only in their memories and thoughts, with the war and the distance separating them. I guess it was the cruelties and the distress of the war, and the times, that makes them hold on to their love. Otherwise, possibly they would have moved on.<br/><br/>The film adopts a non-linear narration style. It repeats may sequences and events, looked at each time from a different character's perspective. This acts like a dissection of the events, making the story look complex and yet opening it up threadbare.<br/><br/>The ending, I felt, did not live up to the rest of the film. Briony opening up to an interviewer to tell the actual truth seemed unlike her. I wonder, if I take that ending out, what would have Briony made of her life. Would she have been consumed by her guilt completely? Would she have moved on? With this ending, I guess she did move on.<br/><br/>A brilliant film. One of the best I have seen this decade."

","I have to say, this film may not be for everyone. The reason is because the film jumps in time a lot, and the film has to be seen cautiously. This film presents a lot of characters in a lot of different perspectives. Occurrences happen a lot from different points of view. The story starts in the year of 1935, from the eyes of a young girl named Briony Tallis(played by Saoirse Ronan). Briony ends up changes her sister and her sister's lover's lives forever. She sees them in a close embrace that she misunderstands. Because of her sights, she accuses the lover, Robbie Turner(played by James McAvoy), and he is sent away. The story is then set to 5 years later, where we see Robbie Turner in the war, his forgotten lover, Cecilia Tallis(played by Kiera Knightley), as a retired nurse that lives alone after five years, and the mysterious and misguided Briony Tallis at 18 years old(played by Romola Garai), who has struck away from the family and is trying to atone for her past mistakes as a nurse. Eventually, Briony Tallis has to overcome what she had to face through all her life, ending the film in the close of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>This film is spectacular because it tells about how a person's sins might change their lives forever. The film also shows how a relationship, one that was never really thought of, one that happened so fast, how it can grow stronger and stronger. The acting in this film is simply very strong. There is not much talking in a lot of scenes between the lovers, but both Knightley and McAvoy command the screen. I thought that James McAvoy deserved an Oscar nomination, and Knightley also did very well enough to get one. The breakthrough performance comes from Saoirse Ronan, who plays Briony at 13 years old. The reason her performance was under Supporting in the Academy Awards is because, even though Briony is really the main character, there are only about the first 45 minutes that she comes out in. Her performance, as a child actor, is really strong, and I am glad she got the buzz. The performance of Briony at 18 years old, played by Romola Garai, is also effective, and she really makes the film to go into the direction that Briony is now sorry for her sins and her lies that she made 5 years ago. The performance that was probably the most effective as a whole, was Vanessa Redgrave playing Briony Tallis at 77 years old. Even though she only has about 5 minutes of screen time at the end of the film, her revelations, her forgiveness, her honesty and her bravery that she conveys with emotions is just amazing. Some say the performance was too short to get recognized, but it did get recognized. Vanessa Redgrave was nominated for a Critic's Choice Award and other awards. Trust me, her acting will make you deeply emotional. <br/><br/>Along with the acting, of course, the screenplay is also very strong. Very dialogue-less, it is able to capture a lot of magic, also because of the director Joe Wright, Joe Wright does a lot of tricks in this film. He is able to capture a 7 minute long shot that is one of the best of the century, and is said to be remembered along with others. The film definitely deserved a Best Director nomination. The cinematography is amazing, The sets are fantastic and realistic, the costumes only help the film more. The original music score, which was done by Dario Marinelli, is probably the most original piece of music I have ever heard. It is a score that is haunting, without being very melodramatic. It's Oscar win was very well deserved.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a pure 10/10 film. It is superb, and it will emotionally shock you, because it has one of the most clever and revealing endings in cinema history. It is a film to endure, and one that I will definitely remember in 10 years, and one that should be classified, maybe as much as other classics like Citizen Kane. yes, it is that good, and it does revolve around one character, Briony Tallis, maybe more than you think..."
"MonroeSmile","10","4","6","19 May 2008"," Outstanding!
","Atonement is the best romantic film that cinema has seen in a long time. It contains everything needed for a romance to tug at our heartstrings.<br/><br/>The British press gave Keira Knightley a lot of credit and were outraged when she didn't receive an Oscar-nomination or a Bafta Award. She is a brilliant actress, stunning in that classical look and I believe the biggest acting sensation since Meryl Streep. However, her performance as Cecilia in Atonement isn't a very large one and therefore I agree and think that the awards went to better performances. The star of the film is without a doubt James McAvoy. His performance reduces you to tears as he is sent to fight in the war. Critics should have made a fuss about him not receiving an Oscar-nomination. He's definitely the best British acting sensation so far and is seriously underrated. His performance is breathtaking.<br/><br/>The music is beautiful and goes perfectly with the story. It is original and one of the best.<br/><br/>Overall, Atonement is a must see! The cast are brilliant, the music is wonderful-and the story is heartbreaking."

","You will forget Pride and Prejudice when you see Joe Wright and Keira Knightley in this movie. This would have to be one of the most beautiful adaptations of a book ever made. It kept to the storyline really well but not so much that the director was terrified of making even the slightest change. The cinematography and the music score in this are beautiful and clever. The flashbacks are great and less confusing than they were in the novel by Ian McEwan and the acting was great. I cannot stand Keira Knightley but she was amazing in this movie and so was James Macavoy who shows he doesn't always have to be remembered as a faun. However the three actors that really steel the show are the three Brionys. Saoirse Ronan was fantastic as the confused child who believes what she tells herself. Then Romola Garai who I think was the best really shoving emotion into her lines. Then Vannessa Redgrave who is on for about five seconds but still nearly brought me to tears in the way she executed her dialogue. If you see this movie I promise you, you will never forget it. This should have won Best Picture!"

","An excellent film. Spectacular cinematography. . Excellent cast, great acting; really takes you on a journey and gets you involved in the film. The story unfolds with the unexpected use of flashbacks. It works very well. Suspenseful, nerve-wracking tension. The scenes of Dunkirk may or may not have been historically accurate, but it conveyed a realism that few attempts at recreating scenes from WWII could match. The film is subtle and has just the right touch to make you work at it and keep you involved - nothing heavy-handed here, as is the case with many other period pieces. My only criticism would be that Ms. Knightley, while a fine actress, needs to eat something. A few more pounds would do her good. She's starting to resemble an exhumed corpse."

The friends who hadn't read the novel were utterly confused throughout most of it, especially at the beginning, because there really isn't a lot of character development. To honestly appreciate this film, make sure you read the book. It opens up so many doors to understanding it. Overall, a brilliant adaptation, however.

"EUyeshima","8","4","6","21 March 2008"," Epic Sweep and Complex Character Arcs Bring Ian McEwan's Masterful Novel to Cinematic Life
","Cineastes will recognize the shadowy figure interviewing the elderly Briony at the end of this sumptuously produced 2007 film as director Anthony Minghella, who tragically passed away earlier this week. One can surmise that director Joe Wright's use of the estimable filmmaker for a well-placed cameo is something of a tribute to Minghella's work on similarly grandiose epics like ""The English Patient"". Minghella would have been an ideal director for Ian McEwan's emotionally complex 2002 novel, as would have been David Lean since the film concurrently evokes the sweep of ""Doctor Zhivago"" and the intimacy of ""Brief Encounter"" (especially in the wartime tearoom scene). Regardless, Wright does an admirable job in translating what is essentially an interior story into something quite cinematic. Much of the film's measured success has to do with his and screenwriter Christopher Hampton's abiding fidelity to McEwan's time-juggling story structure.<br/><br/>The story is actually divided into two discrete parts. The first takes place on an inauspicious summer day at a rolling English estate in 1935 as precocious 13-year-old Briony Tallis writes a play for the children to perform at a dinner party that evening. She idolizes her beautiful older sister Cecilia and harbors a crush on the housekeeper's impassioned son Robbie Turner. When she sees the two together at the garden fountain, she presumes a situation more provocative than what really occurred. Later that evening, Briony makes a false accusation, and Robbie ends up wrongly accused of a crime and sent off to prison. The second part takes place five years later as Europe is engulfed in WWII. Robbie has moved from prisoner to foot soldier in France, aching over Cecilia while trying to get to Dunkirk in order to return to England. Cecilia has become a nurse, as has a now-grown Briony regretfully estranged from her sister. Where the story goes from there is startling and moving in ways that are quite unexpected.<br/><br/>I'm rather divided on the performances. As the headstrong Cecilia, Keira Knightley evokes old-school glamour with her coltish beauty in an impactful manner reminiscent of a young Katharine Hepburn, but her character dissipates somewhat as the story progresses. James McAvoy captures the boyish magnetism of Robbie while gaining gravitas as his idealized character faces the fatalistic horror of war head on. Together though, Knightley and McAvoy somehow just miss creating the image of enduring passion necessary to carry the core story. On the other hand, Briony allows three superb actresses to seamlessly show the character's evolving fate. As the adolescent, Saoirse Ronan dominates the first third of the film with searing self-possession. She makes us care about Briony despite her repugnant act of self-interest. Romola Garai takes over as a young, uncertain nurse caring for badly maimed soldiers in a London hospital. Finally, Vanessa Redgrave carries the last scene by providing the denouement with her characteristic authority and giving the title its true meaning.<br/><br/>All the production values are stunning  Sarah Greenwood's meticulous production design, especially in the Dunkirk scenes; Jacqueline Durran's simply designed period costumes; Dario Marianelli's stirring music score (with an effective if somewhat excessive use of typewriter keys to punctuate key scenes) and Seamus McGarvey's rich cinematography. Pay particular attention to the uninterrupted five-minute tracking shot at Dunkirk done with a Steadicam, a bravura set piece along the lines of the opening scene in Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"". The 2008 DVD has a fairly standard set of extras for such an elaborate production - an informative commentary track from Wright; a comprehensive, half-hour making-of documentary, ""Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of 'Atonement'""; a five-minute short, ""From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic"", in which Wright, Hampton and McEwan discuss the transition on a cursory level; and seven deleted scenes, about eight minutes in total with optional commentary from Wright."
"DesbUK","9","4","6","17 March 2008"," The Best British Film of 2007
","Winner of the 2007 BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Film, 'Atonement' has an opening 45 minutes which recalls the 'The Go-Between' - a hot English summer and lust between the lower and upper classes. Robbie (James McAvoy) is the gardener and Cecilia (Kiera Knightley) is the daughter of the household. A grabbed moment of lust in the library is witnessed by Cecilia's 13-year old sister Briony (Saorise Ronan) and, when another young girl is molested, Briony falsely accuses Robbie. At this point the film becomes an essay on the beastliness of the English upper classes - particularly Benedict Cumberbatch's total cad - and there is a sadness that prevails throughout the story of Robbie and Cecilia's ruined lives. <br/><br/>Robbie goes to prison and is released in 1940 to fight with the British Expeditory Force in France. He and Cecilia have one more meeting over tea.<br/><br/>In lesser hands, the story could have been clunky and dated - but Joe Wright has a young, cinematic eye and he's helped by one of the best adaptors of difficult material in the business (Christopher Hampton). There's a terrific sequence set on the beach at Dunkirk, with the stranded British army waiting for evacuation that's a triumph of Steadicam operation, music score and Sarah Greenwood's production design, which suggests an army defeated and disorganised - there's everything from an abandoned boat to a funfair on the beach. The sequence - all a single tracking shot following Robbie - is astonishingly moving.<br/><br/>Back in London, Briony (now 18 and played by Romola Garari) becomes a nurse and is haunted by her dishonesty. And herein is the film's only flaw: the penultimate scene of Briony visiting Robbie and Cecilia and seeking a chance to make amends for what she's done. It turns out to be the invention of the adult Briony (Vanessa Redgrave), a chapter in her final novel. The real Robbie and Cecilia had died in 1940 and this is the only way she could she could gain atonement for what she's done. But it's an implausible ending that sabotages the finale - like a ""It was all dream"" revelation or a false flashback.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a sterling film, impeccably acted by every member of the cast and one that demands and rewards more than one viewing."
"stuartdr","10","4","6","2 March 2008"," ""I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.""
","Atonement is an original drama that is both tragic and beautiful. This being my 3rd Best Picture nominee to watch, my thoughts were ""Can it beat Juno?"" Amazingly, it did (Although barely). The storyline is superb and strays away from many clichés in the dramas. <br/><br/>The movie is another one of those ""star crossed lover"" type stories. The man is accused of a crime that he did not commit and is sent off to fight in the war. The main actors, James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, drive the film in a very effective way. These two actors create a story that is truly believable and proves to be very immersive. <br/><br/>You will notice the unique cinematography almost as soon as the film starts. Every source of light is blurry and has a sort of bloom effect. This makes the film look whited out. Also it makes the film looks dreamy as if it is a part of a memory. Character progression is on the slow side but you get to know many of the character very well. The score, which the film won the Oscar for, is interesting and enjoyable. The film incorporates the tapping of the typewriter with the orchestral background music.<br/><br/>The one problem is quite obvious: the plot progression is rather confusing. It jumps from one point to another and goes back and forth. This is most annoying especially when it goes ""2 weeks prior"" in a scene where you're already confused as to where in the time of the film the current scene is taking place in. Although it wasn't that big of a problem for me, it might be a little aggravating for some viewers. Also some of the wounded soldier shots are quite gruesome and gritty. They are very graphic although majority of these shots are concentrated into clump of scenes and it is not something that comes back often.<br/><br/>The ending concludes all of the main three characters' stories up very well. It is a very emotional ending and is very well done. It is probably something you're not expecting and I thought it was a solid ending. Atonement is ultimately an extremely personal film. Each character has a unique quality to them and story that drives the film become very personal. As long as you can put up with the jumping plot and long-ish run time, you should find this film a treat. It uses emotions effectively, characters are developed well and you will care for them (Well maybe not that little girl. Personally I hated her guts). I thought this film was one of the best I saw this year and it is definitely a one you don't want to miss out on."
"bartholomewrichards","9","4","6","23 February 2008"," To Successfully Have A Cake And Eat It Too
","Judging by the trailer for Atonement, as well as its reviews, I had this film pegged as one of those stuffy British period pieces in the Merchant/Ivory vein. Those films don't usually get awards coverage, but this one had something to do with World War II, and as we all know, awards people love World War II. Upon finally seeing the film, I was greatly surprised, not only is it captivating, but it has all sorts of narrative tricks up it's sleeve to keep the proceedings moving.<br/><br/>The movie begins on a bourgeois estate in England. On it live the sisters, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) and Cecilia (Keira Knightley). Robbie works on the farm as a hired hand. He does the work while the owner of the estate pays for his education. Between Cecilia and Robbie, there is a romance occurring unbeknownst to the other residents of the estate. When Briony sees something occur between them outside the window, she assumes that something occurred which did not.<br/><br/>This section of the film carries within it a lot of tension. Director Joe Wright fleshes out characters efficiently and makes us feel for Robbie when the police take him away. There are two events in particular that are shown separately from the perspectives of the different characters involved. Instead of crosscutting as most directors would, Wright shows these scenes one after another, building the level of suspense in each of them.<br/><br/>When certain further events occur, it leads to Briony to tell a lie which results in Robbie being sent to prison. The second portion of the film follows Robbie in France as he attempts to cross the English Isle to get back to Cecilia. He is given a choice between serving in France or serving his prison sentence. Upon reaching the coast of France, there is a magnificent long take which follows Robbie walk along the beach before focusing on the chaos of the moment and returning to Robbie. It lasts a few minutes and is destined to be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed about this film is that most of the reviews I have read seem to snub the involvement of Joe Wright as the Director. This is most recently seen in the Oscar nominations, Atonement was nominated for Best Picture, but Wright was not nominated for Best Director. What happens in this act of the film is very director driven, as are certain decisions in the first and third acts of the film regarding how the narrative develops. I was not expecting this level of maturity and style going into the film, considering Wright's only other film was the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice that I never saw (srsly, I have to read Jane Austen's Persuasion in English this year and I am not looking forward to it). If anything, this film owes more of a debt to its director than the script or any of the actors, all of which are fine, but would have failed with with a less sure hand at the helm.<br/><br/>The third act of the film follows Briony (now played by Romola Garai), as she faces her guilt and realizes that she was wrong. The film follows her as she tries to right about her experience and she tries to contact her sister, who estranged herself from the family after Robbie was arrested. Following this, Vanessa Redgrave makes a heartbreaking cameo as the elderly Briony, now a celebrated author.<br/><br/>This portion of the film also features a narrative format that is unconventional. I would be guilty of spoiling the surprise if I told you what it was now. For now, all I will say is that the film manages to have its cake, and then proceed to eat it as well. I would never have thought that an ending like this would work, but somehow, it does. I highly recommend this movie, even for people with penises. It is much better than the coverage would let you know."
"EijnarAmadeus","8","4","6","10 February 2008"," Beautiful, gripping, passionate.
","There is so much to say about 2007's Atonement; this is a beautiful, absolutely astonishing movie directed by a SO-incredibly talented Joe Wright. He unravels the war/history/romance/drama genre with an enormous depth, he breathes new fire into a worn genre - he speaks to today's teenagers and young lovers, a generation who needs a motion picture's magnificence to describe their longings for their loved ones when separated by war. The vision of the movie is drenched in its totally unique cinematic beauty, the cinematography and production design can't be described in one word; it's utterly breathtaking, so powerfully attached to the movie's center-core that Atonement will find love just as much as audiences loves it.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Keira Knightley do electrifying performances; McAvoy's Robbie Turner can't find words to describe his feelings for the beautiful Cecilia Tallis. The tension between the two boils, and throughout the movie the cinematography leads on the dance of longing and lost love. It's definitely one of the strongest Oscar-contenders to the 2007 awards; astonishing from the hot-summer opening to the surprising climax."
"doctorsmoothlove","8","4","6","6 February 2008"," Very worthy of its praise.
","Even if I wanted to spoil the plot of ""Atonement"" I couldn't. It's very similar to ""Perfect Blue"" in that regard. However, the plot itself is very complicated. We are presented with events from a third person's perspective then we view them from the participant's perspective. This gives the film the same mystic appeal that Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being had. We are able to know Briony, Robbie, and Cecelia so much better because of this. The only area with regards to the plot that I found the film did not portray was Briony's crush on Robbie (I read a summary of the book). Even though, as an adult, Briony does reveal that she had a crush on Robbie, this is not evident when she was a child (other than the flashback). However, where this film succeeds is that it portrays all of its characters tragically while still allowing us to know them.<br/><br/>The acting was also memorable in the film. Kiera Knightly acted very dignified and responsive to her surroundings. It must be because Wright asked her to watch films that were released during the era the film portrays. Kiera is becoming my favorite actress after Helena Bonham Carter. What was also evident even from the other actors was the humanly way they acted. Nothing they did could be perceived as unnatural. Seeing Briony read in the forested area was like seeing footage from a home movie because of how natural it looked. If you recall from my ""Lady in the Water"" review, I mentioned how unrealistic the film was (even by fantasy standards). Those actors conformed to stereotypes and expectations, but these actors did not. Also, James McAvoy actually looked as if he wanted to have sex with Kiera Knightly's character during the library scene. I must also say that the costume designer did a good job in dressing the three actresses that played Briony throughout her life. Each of them had the mole on her face, and I could imagine that each of them was Briony. However, when Briony was in her 20s, the film didn't do a good job of portraying Cecilia's character as having aged. She looked exactly the same as she did as she did in the manor. However, I don't fault the film much for that mistake. It didn't affect the plot too much.<br/><br/>While this film isn't the most impacting that I've seen this year, I would heartily recommend seeing it. It is a realistic portrayal of someone attempting to sympathize with the crime she committed in her life. The acting is good enough to convince you that the character's struggle is worthy of your attention. It isn't a film that I would necessarily own, but I have enough respect for it to read the book (which I'm doing now)."
"simon-gangl","9","4","6","29 January 2008"," Beauty and perfection
","To say it straight away ...<br/><br/>I can't remember a movie before Atonement to picture such a broad spectrum of the human soul in one single movie, and yet is every aspect portrayed with such detail and beauty.<br/><br/>In this movie everything seems explained; guilt, love, sorrow, hate, hope ... crime, war, peace ...<br/><br/>The direction was really impressive, the cinematography just beautiful, the soundtrack was perfect, the sound editing thrilling. I don't want to give everything away, but if you see this movie, is hard to look at the movie itself, because there are all those perfect details in direction ...<br/><br/>As for the ending ... I guess some will love it as the whole movie, some (including me) will find it ""inapropiate"" to the movie, stealing a bit of its beauty!"

","Wow, you completely summed up the feelings I had for Atonement. I completely agree with you. The first third, with the sweltering chemistry between Robbie and Cecilia, along with the imaginative Briony, is pure cinematic brilliance. The second part, with the Dunkirk scene, is abruptly less powerfully emotional than the beginning. The third act, with an older Briony, is even less emotional, and to me it was confusing and almost out of place. I think you were right in stating that the screenwriter had the most difficulty adapting the book somewhere in the middle of the movie. I am glad that someone besides me was somewhat disappointed with the second half of the movie."
"colonel_green","10","4","6","28 January 2008"," An excellent turn from all involved.
","Like so many of the best films of 2007, ""Atonement"" does not see wide distribution until 2008, owing to the practise of holding back the so-called Oscar-bait movies until limited release in December, to meet the Academy's deadlines while keeping the movies in the minds of voters. And so, at January's end, I finally got to see the new film adaptation of Graham McEwan's novel ""Atonement"" (I have not read the novel).<br/><br/>The story follows Cecilia and Briony Tallis, two sisters from an upper class family in interwar England, and Robbie, their groundskeeper who has also been patronized by their father, and gone on to some education. The opening segment (covering perhaps the first hour) is set in 1935, and shows how Cecilia and Robbie's burgeoning relationship becomes the victim of a lie told by Briony, who does not understand what she sees, and how her own feelings cause her to act. The next segment, set in 1940 on the eve of the 'miracle of Dunkirk', depicts the fallout of this lie, as Briony, now a young woman, tries to make up for what she has done. Finally, there is an epilogue set in the present day, where the question of Briony's atonement is examined at the end of her life.<br/><br/>Briony, the central character, is played by three different actresses in the course of the film: first, Saoirse Ronan as a 13-year-old girl; by Romola Garai as an 18-year-old; and by acting legend Vanessa Redgrave as an old woman. All three actresses are fantastic; most of the critical acclaim, including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, has accrued to Ronan as the young Briony, and she would be a worthy recipient of the award. Keira Knightley, the big name in the cast (re-teaming with Joe Wright, her director on ""Pride & Prejudice"", one of my favourite recent films), is impressive, and develops good chemistry with James McAvoy as Robbie. Also present in a minor role is the great Brenda Blethyn (also of ""Pride & Prejudice"").<br/><br/>The most talked-about scene in the film is the depiction of the beaches of Dunkirk in the days of the evacuation. The five-minute continuous tracking shot of soldiers walking through the chaos has already become famous; there is tremendous poetry in Wright's visuals, as the music of singing soldiers swells, abandoned Ferris wheels absently turn, and horses are shot for lack of food and transport.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the film is remarkably powerful, aborting the expectations of a traditional Hollywood period drama; sins, it seems, cannot always be made up for like in the movies. There is also the question raised of whether fiction can/should be used in the way Briony ends up using it, and whether she is simply continuing to deceive herself at the end of her life. This is by no means a happy film, and some unaware viewers expecting a companion piece to Knightley and Wright's ""Pride & Prejudice"" should look elsewhere; but for an adult tragedy, this production has few compeers this year."
"lucasaq-1","9","4","6","26 January 2008"," Beautifully Sad
","Joe Wright has master eye for the camera. He seems to like to tell the story by having characters in the most beautiful settings he can imagine or create. Atonement is no different and, in fact, I might say a trifle more beautiful and much sadder than his previous work in Pride & Prejudice. While not among my top tier film masterpieces of the year this comes quite close with its great story design and strong performances. And in a year full of sad films it does not quite the punch of the films with the message, but rather just sticks to the tale and tells is exquisitely. This is a tale of misunderstanding and of course, atonement.<br/><br/>The tale begins of a little girl, Briony, played fantastically by Saoirse Ronan, who is typing a play up and is quite excited about it. Things do not go so well though when she wants to see the play done. Circumstances are bad for the visiting children and she has to make sacrifices, but then she gets a doozy of an idea when she misconstrues a situation from a far of her sister and the gardener. More errors are made on both sides further along as she jumps to conclusions with a creative mind, the gardener writes and sends the wrong letter, and of course, Briony can resist a read when she is entrusted with it. The sins and misinterpretations of one day and one night have devastating repercussions with jail being the least of worries when war comes.<br/><br/>I will point out one of my few quirks about the situation here. I do not get why the pair did not just talk over the situation with Briony when she saw them in the library. It just made it that much more muddled. Sure Briony did the telling and jumped to the conclusion, but they offered her no explanation and she was young impressionable and the other cousin agreed to the lie.<br/><br/>Well anyways, besides my reservations about how the situation arose and where the blame was cast, I became enthralled in how Wright broached the war and the incredible makeup that was used in the hospital scenes. That was quite a spectacle and made one shudder a bit without being harsh. He did much the same with the Dunkirk sequence, which was disgusting in the horror of the situation and beautiful with how the camera moved across it all. For a guy who I heard does not like period pieces, Wright is a natural nay a master at it."
"isabelle1955","Null","4","6","21 January 2008"," Lots of Acting
","""There was an awful lot of acting in that movie,"" said my husband as we left the theatre. I know what he meant. Atonement's the kind of movie that wins awards because the relatively simple story line and lack of explosions and car chases, gives the actors a chance to string coherent words together, more than 2 or 3 at a time, and deliver them without simultaneously drawing a gun or jumping over roof tops. Not that I don't like action movies. I do. It's just nice occasionally to watch something more cerebral. <br/><br/>There are many things I loved about Atonement, yet still, at the end I was surprised it didn't move me more or have a bigger emotional impact on me. With such a tragic storyline, I was fully prepared for a good weep, but somehow it never fully engaged me emotionally. I'm still trying to decide quite why. <br/><br/>The cast was certainly excellent. Keira Knightley (Cecilia) is not only gorgeous to look at for extended periods of time on screen, but she's very effective portraying Cecilia, the eldest daughter of an upper crust family, whiling away a long, hot, sultry summer in a country house just before World War 2, when Britain was still in the grasp of an enervating class system. Women of her class were still required to do little at that time beyond marry well, and Cecilia is clearly bored to tears and frustrated on every level. Her clipped tones and delivery are perfect. Contrast this with Knightley's 2002 performances in Pure, or Bend it Like Beckham, and you will see just how far she has come as an actor. Four years have taken her from gangly kid to sultry sex symbol with no pit stops for rehab, and I adore her for it. James McAvoy (Robbie) seems to have come from nowhere to become a major male star in very short order, although I know in actuality he's been around a while. I've thought him excellent in every movie I've seen him in, especially The Last King of Scotland. All three actresses who play Cecilia's little sister Briony as she ages, are equally good, and all the supporting cast are very proficient. <br/><br/>Director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice) creates a languid and vaguely erotic, sexually charged atmosphere between Cecilia and Robbie, a couple who are wildly attracted to each other but separated by the artificial barrier of class. He contrasts Robbie - bright, well educated and stifled by his humble origins - with the crass, upper class twitishness of Cecilia's brother Leon and his unpleasant friend Paul. Cecilia and Robbie cross paths repeatedly, trying to ignore their obvious mutual attraction. This is a classic example of how to create sexual energy and tension on screen with very little actual physical contact, before the fateful library scene. But when they do finally come together they sizzle, positively setting the screen on fire for a few brief moments before fate, in the shape of nosey Briony, intervenes. It's hard to define chemistry in a couple on screen, you just know it when you see it. These two have it in bucket loads.<br/><br/>Wrongly accused of a sexual assault, Robbie is dragged off to prison, and the summer idyll comes to an abrupt end, not just for the protagonists but for the whole country, as WW2 looms ahead. Four years later Robbie is in the army, stranded at Dunkirk and Cecilia has become the efficient ward sister of a London hospital. Briony, also a nurse, wants to make amends for the terrible accusations she made which put Robbie in jail. But the past can never be undone. <br/><br/>Much has been written about the Dunkirk beach scene, so I won't repeat it except to say that it is cleverly filmed but looked a little too much like a graphic novel storyboard at times. The cinematography of the whole movie is beautiful, as it was in Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice in 2005. He has a real feel for the beauty of old British country estates, and he certainly showcases Knightley at her very best. Yes, that dress is stunning. <br/><br/>Yet I felt the movie lost emotional impact by showing us the various real and fictional endings (fictional as imagined by an adult Briony, now a novelist.) In that respect it reminded me of The French Lieutenant's Woman. This is almost an attempt to be too cerebral, and it comes at the expense of emotional involvement. Which is a pity. There is still a place in cinema for the unabashed representation of love, whether thwarted as this is, or fulfilled. Somehow this is just too detached. I haven't read the book so I'm willing to believe it is an accurate interpretation, but personally, I'd have simply shown the tragic ending, rather than Briony's fictional option, and left the audience to work out the 'what ifs' for themselves. It would have left at least this audience member sad but more satisfied."
"cultfilmfan","10","4","6","19 January 2008"," Atonement
","Atonement is based upon the novel of the same name by Ian McEwan. The film takes place in 1930's England where a young girl named Briony Tallis witnesses several incidents all in the course of one day and one of them involving her older sister Cecilia and the house's servant Robbie Turner. Not knowing what to make of the events, Briony lies to the authorities in a move that will affect Cecilia and Robbie for the rest of their lives and will also haunt her for the rest of hers as well. This film really is a perfect showcase for the different characters in the story and their emotions, thoughts, feelings and decisions. Going to the authorities and ruining the lives of the people around her are brought on by Briony most likely because as we can see she is brought up into royalty in a very strict, classy and conservative environment and probably has no insight or ideas of what she is later to learn on the night when everything changes. Because she has had such a carefree and in a sense isolated life she has been hidden from these sort of situations and also because of an underlying issue that we learn later in the film is the cause for her harsh and life changing decision she makes by going to the authorities. The film brilliantly captures the different characters at several stages of their life and how the events of the past have hurt them and how they will never be the same because of it. The emotions whether let out or bottled in are really shown by the very talented actors who portray these characters in the film and the film's script gives us a lot to think about and shows us a side of human nature that may seem cruel or ugly, but in most cases is probably more likely than we would like to admit. The story is at times moving, haunting, thought provoking and is paced well especially in the second half and is a film that leaves the viewer with a lot to think about after the initial viewing. Not because the film is in any way particularly confusing, but because of the different social studies of these characters and because of the decisions they make out of ignorance, or for other reasons. The film is set to a beautiful backdrop of wonderful looking cinematography, great sets and costumes that really capture the place and time and a beautiful musical score as well. The real gift of this film besides the very talented people in front of and behind the camera is the script and the book it is based on because it delves into these characters so deeply and shows us their raw and real emotions, flaws and what makes them do the things they do. I personally am one who likes a movie that makes me think and stays with me after I have seen it and this one did that for me. This was a wonderful theatrical version of a great script and novel that is brought to such life and beauty by the great cast and crew behind it. A beautiful, thought provoking and in ways a haunting film that stayed with me and made me want to analyze the film more and more because of these rich characters. This is certainly one of the best films of 2007."

No, there is not any action scenes, there is a few scenes that depict a great deal of graphic war images, but they don't depict any war fighting. The movie is more a crime/drama that involves romance.<br/><br/>The movie also has a bit of a twist for an end.<br/><br/>This years Oscars ought to be quite interesting between this, Sweeney Todd, There will be Blood, American Gangster, No Country for Old Men and IMHO Gone Baby Gone.

"poojucu","9","4","6","4 January 2008"," Essential Movie Viewing
","I saw Attonement sitting at the very front of the cinema, in the row where even when you slouch you cannot see the whole of the screen. This horrible disadvantage when seeing a movie did not lessen or do anything to impede my enjoyment of Attonement, this testifies just how good this film really is.<br/><br/>Attonement is set in the early 1900s and begins in an idyllic English house with a handful of characters. We first meet Briany (Saoirse Ronan)a young imaginative girl who then proceeds to lead us too the other characters in a series of quick scenes. She greets Robbie the (James Mcavoy) very briefly before we also get the first meeting with the other main character Cecilia (Keira Knightly).<br/><br/>Through a series of misconceptions and assumptions on Brianys behalf, she convinces herself that Robbie is a sex maniac and not too be trusted. As of such when an assault takes place near the house, she tells the police that Robbie is the culprit, she testifies against him, and he is sent too prison (chossing later to go too war instead) It's good to finally see a movie that does not treat the audience as six year old, instead it leaves the audience too notice the small, subtle details that are pivotal too the plot. By making this assumption, it makes the viewing experience more enjoyable as you begin too have to pick up and Analise peoples reactions, eyes and overall their characters to figure who is too be trusted and who is hiding under a phisade. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed this movie because of it's ability too make the whole thing seem so realistic. A mid way tracking shot of Dunkirk Beach is particularly effective in making it all seem so very real and haunting. The performances are top quality, James Mcavoy in particular juggles a complex role and breaks out with some truly mesmerizing acting moments. Attonement is ultimately a story of love, and really does not stray from this main plot. It's about a couple deeply in love, whom are separated, then against all odds they must get back too each other, very sentimental I know, but still it never seemed that way. The way it was filmed, written and acted did not let it become sentimental either, almost like a Shakespearian tragedy. <br/><br/>The Writing in Attonement is of absolute quality, it is convincing, believable and the end monologue left me stunned. This is a deep movie, that is deserving all off the credit it gets."
"intelearts","9","4","6","2 January 2008"," Excellent production values to top a very good adaptation
","Atonement has awards written all over it.<br/><br/>The story of two lovers betrayed by a younger sister then parted by the second world war is beautifully shot and conceived by a wonderful team. The settings are perfectly realised, and McAvoy et al do a good job. For my money, the ending is the best of any major film this year.<br/><br/>Credit must go to Working Title and the legacy of George Harrison, Merchant Ivory, and even, Greenaway for laying the tracks that kept the British Film industry alive. It may not produce anything like the amount of the US or India but the quality is outstanding.<br/><br/>The score by Dario Marianelli is certainly a highlight. Not the typewriter, but towards the end the score definitely captures strains of Elgar and Tippett. For my money better even that his score for Pride and Prejudice which was Oscar nominated last year. In addition, Seamus McGarvey and Paul Tothill both deserve mention for the cinematography and editing respectively.<br/><br/>Will it win an Oscar? Perhaps not best film - but one thing is clear it will clean up at the BAFTAs for sure.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the viewing- for my money better than the English Patient - more human and detailed emotionally - a must for all who like their films to be something to linger."
"hollywoodgirl-1","8","4","6","30 December 2007"," Absolutely Stunning
","I have been waiting to see this movie for a very long time and today I finally got to see it. I had been trying not to get too excited in case it didn't live up to my expectations, but I needn't have worried. The movie absolutely blew me away.<br/><br/>First off, it was filmed beautifully. Joe Wright really has a talent for using the natural surroundings to his advantage, I also loved that in Pride and Prejudice. The now-famous Dunkirk scene was just stunning. I was really excited to see that after all I had heard and it was just amazing. Wright really captured the anti-glory of the war when WWI is often characterized by the initial euphoria of all parties involved that war had come, then the steep disillusionment that followed. I was so glad that he did the shot as one long continuous take, it was excellent.<br/><br/>Now, the performances. Starting with the most attention-getting, Keira Knightley did a fabulous job as Cecilia. I've read the novel and I felt that she really embodied the character. Saoirse Ronan was the most perfect young Briony. She's gotten a lot of attention as well and she fully deserves it, she was fantastic as the self-centered, ignorant, spoiled little rich girl. I felt, however, that the movie truly belonged to James McAvoy. He was so heartrending and incredible as Robbie. True, he and Keira Knightley didn't have a ton of crackling chemistry, but his earnestness and her eagerness make you really believe and feel for them.<br/><br/>The writers did a great job adapting Ian McEwan's sprawling novel, and they did an excellent job showing the introspectiveness that the novel conveys. Of course it's hard to get so deeply inside of each character's head the way the novel does, but the movie does an excellent job without feeling rushed or choppy. As with Pride and Prejudice, they clipped the unnecessary but kept the heart of the story.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an excellent, amazing movie, my definite favorite of the year and very worth seeing."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Teaming up again after ""Pride and Prejudice"" are director Joe Wright and the finally maturing Keira Knightley. This time they tackle Ian McEwan's monster novel and for the most part deliver a tense, emotional ride.<br/><br/>Knightley and James McAvoy (""The Last King of Scotland"") are very good and very believable together, but the ""star"" of the film is Knightley's wicked lil sis played by three actresses - Saoirse Ronan (age 13), the weak link of Ramola Garai (age 18) and a perfectly cast Vanessa Redgrave as the elder Briony wrapping the story up for the viewer in a TV interview for her final novel. By the way, the interviewer in that scene is ""The English Patient"" director Anthony Minghella.<br/><br/>Not to give anything away, but normally the story is what makes a film enjoyable for me. Here, I actually admired the film's structure and delivery of the story ... definitely not dumbed down the way so many book-to-movie projects are. Certainly the middle of the film drags a bit as McAvoy wanders through the countryside and 18 yr old Briony pays her penance as a war nurse, but the first 45 minutes of the film are truly outstanding.<br/><br/>Just a warning, this is not the feel good, sappy Hollywood garbage that many think it is. Many scenes are extremely uncomfortable to watch and I heard more than a few sniffles coming from the crowd. The score is outstanding and expertly conveys depth to many scenes ... especially the remarkable long cut as McAvoy walks through the beach camp for soldiers.<br/><br/>Excellent support work from Brenda Blethyn and Benedict Cumberbatch (""Amazing Grace""), and again the elegant Ms. Redgrave perfectly captures Briony's struggle for the truth and redemption and ""atonement""."

","A brief, misplaced note, an epic novel meant to cleanse scarred souls, the knowledge that what is written and what is said can both kill and heal - and it all begins with the sound of typewriter keys clacking against white paper, preparing the viewer for the cataclysmic events to unfold.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright has created the most breathtaking and tragic film of the last decade, an event that is magnificent and intimate at the same time, one that marries sweeping cinematic visuals with the most personal and nuanced acting performances of the year.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy are astounding as the doomed lovers, their mature performances defying their youth. Saoirse Ronan is nothing short of spectacular as precocious Briony Tallis, the child with the vivid imagination who sets the film's events in motion. As 18-year old Briony, Romola Garai carries a lifetime of anguish on her face. And although Vanessa Redgrave has less than five minutes of total screen time, her heartbreaking soliloquy is like a punch to the gut that will have even the most hardened souls choking back the tears and leaving no one doubting that Redgrave is among the finest actresses alive today.<br/><br/>The brilliant cinematography of Seamus McGarvey, the tense musical score of Dario Marianelli (who ingeniously integrates clacking typewriter keys into his compositions), and the beautifully detailed vintage costuming by Jacqueline Durran form a ""perfect cinematic storm,"" enveloping the viewer both visually and emotionally.<br/><br/>When the screen fades to black and the credits begin to roll, but the audience remains seated and silent, you know you've got a winner, and that's exactly what happens with ""Atonement,"" a near perfect achievement."

","As a longtime movie buff, but a novice IMDb comment writer, I approach this with a little perspective and a little intimidation. I also went to see this movie not having read the novel and deliberately avoiding any detailed reviews of its plot. The result: I found the movie overall to tell its story absolutely amazingly well, especially its outstanding beginning! The portrayal of the early events that form the basis of this movie accomplish what only happens rarely - immerse one completely into the story and into its characters. Awards to all involved but most especially the director, screenwriter, and editor. High artistic risks were taken by very talented folks acting on both their muse and the full potential of their talents to produce something rarely seen these day - mirabile visu - a film well worth seeing!"

","Overall, this is a great movie, solid story, good acting, amazing cinematography, but oh, how it drags. For once, Kiera Knightly is in a role she can play, but again, she needs some food. James McAvoy is absolutely brilliant, the girl who plays the young Bryione is top notch, and with the supporting roles, an excellent well-rounded cast. The cinematography is excellent, especially the Dunkirk beach scenes. The music is a refreshing look at contemporary music. But not all movies are perfect. This is no exception. I found some parts, especially in the middle and end, dragged a little too much. When the end came, it was half an hour too long. Also, the plot is slightly confusing with flashbacks and whatnot. But, if you are a melodrama fan, this is your movie."
"cdelacroix1","9","4","6","22 December 2007"," Beautiful, Moving, Utterly Captivating Story of the Greatest Generation
","I saw this movie today the day after it opened here in general release. And I think this is the best movie I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The visuals captured me from the first frame. What an amazing series of scenes: a beautiful late 1930s English country estate; wartime France; Dunkirk; wartime London. Every scene appeared perfectly composed, perfectly filmed, with perfect colors and sights and sounds. Authenticity and beauty were captured on every single frame of this movie. The attention to detail was exquisite without becoming at any point distracting. If there's such a thing as perfect cinematography and perfect lighting and perfect editing, this movie must come about as close to achieving these ideals as I for one can imagine. In fact, if this movie had had no dialog at all, I think I would have sat enthralled by the absolutely amazing visuals, from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The story, though, was captivating in a special way. Special because of course we all know from the trailer what the basic plot is, and although there are important twists as things proceed, on the whole, we're watching a movie the storyline of which we already know. There's a special pleasure to watching something unfold like this, and I love the way the story was conveyed almost as much as I love the story itself. Deft flashbacks, with changes of point of view, convey so much of the richness of the story.<br/><br/>To me, the interaction between the characters and their context is what made the whole story so fascinating. Here we have really very narrow parameters laid down and our characters must make their choices within those parameters with consequences of personal enormity for each of them. The film conveys the Character--Context interaction in an especially fine way by showing & repeating again and again. Sometimes the repetition comes through flashback: for example, in the fountain scene. Sometimes it comes through interleaving points of view: for example, near the beginning, when Cecilia and Robbie are thinking about each other. Most fascinating to me is when the repetition comes through a sort of deft camera's wheeling slowly and deliberately through a scene, following characters moving this way and that: for example, the amazing Dunkirk sequence.<br/><br/>A key theme of the movie, as we all know from the trailer, is What's Real and What's Not. And this is played upon in so many wonderfully delightful ways. There are so many scenes through windows, and sights in mirrors, and POV shots up and down hallways and through fields; typewritten pages retyped and retyped and retyped. What we see, what we think we see, and what we do about what we see, or think we see, are all so intimately bound up with who we are: and this is expressed from beginning to end with a sense of authenticity and beauty that was for me just extraordinary.<br/><br/>The characterizations and performances were just wonderful throughout this movie. James McAvoy's Robbie Turner was excellent. Keira Knightly's Cecilia Tallis was solid and convincing. Saorise Ronan as the young, 13 year old Briony Tallis was just extraordinary for her age I hope that we see more of this young talent. All of the supporting actors and actresses were first rate. Special props should go to Vanessa Redgrave for her affecting and very convincing cameo as the elderly Briony.<br/><br/>Now I do have two criticisms that (to be honest) may or may not be reasonably laid at the doorstep of this movie.<br/><br/>One is that to me, the build up to the arrest felt like it *may* have been somewhat long. Maybe a little shorter would be better. Maybe.<br/><br/>Also, from time to time, I plain old had problems making out what was being said. I don't know if this is because I was simply so overwhelmed by the visual imagery that I wasn't paying as much attention to the dialog as I usually would. Or maybe the audio in my theater may have been a little off.<br/><br/>But these are really minor drawbacks to the movie, if they are drawbacks to the movie at all. Again, I'm just not sure. To me this is simply a splendid, wonderful, and captivating movie no less.<br/><br/>Before I close, I have something to say on a personal note.<br/><br/>My father & mother were both members of ""The Greatest Generation"" - the WWII generation which is depicted with such extraordinary clarity in this movie. My father was a soldier in WWII. My mother waited on the Home Front as she waited for him to come home. I take away from this movie a very strong sense that this is a true and authentic representation of what that period of time was like for this generation. I come away from this movie with a deep, deep, deep feeling of sheer gratitude for this generation. For the last half of the movie, I simply could hardly stop crying; and left the theater crying as well: tears of joy and gratitude and of sadness at the passing of this amazing generation.<br/><br/>All in all, then, if you want to see an amazing period piece about the extraordinary and ordinary people of the Greatest Generation, set in the late 1930s  1940s: please, see this movie. It is absolutely one of the most delightful and authentic human tales of the World War II generation that I've ever had the privilege of experiencing. And the movie conveys its story with the most lovely, most beautiful, most affecting images that I have seen in years, perhaps decades.<br/><br/>As I feel deep gratitude for this generation, I feel deep gratitude to Director Joe Wright and everyone who brought this movie to us. It seems so little to say, but I'll say it anyway: Thanks."

","From Joe Wright, the acclaimed director Pride and Prejudice comes his sophomore effort, Atonement based on the best selling novel by Ian McEwan. The film tells the story of Robbie and Cecilia, two young lovers torn apart by a false accusation of young Briony, Cecilia's sister. Robbie is sent to prison and in exchange for his incarceration, he must serve in World War II for his freedom.<br/><br/>This is technically and visually the best film of the year. The stunning cinematography by Seamus McGarvey which acts like a photographer capturing the glimpses at the doors of heaven are absolutely breathtaking. The scenery and images are all but believable as we are thrown into a time of passion, betrayal, corruption, and torment.<br/><br/>Now, I've never been a fan of British Cinema like the next avid Oscar watcher. Never cared for Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice wasn't terrible but nothing great, Howard's End and The Remains of the Day are mediocre to me. The reason I say this is that I was feeling the way I felt about those films with Atonement for the first half. I thought was melodrama to the extreme and overly emotional and presented that it disengaged the viewer from the picture. As the film continued I felt myself being closely drawn to the performance of James McAvoy very reminiscent of Jude Law's performance in Cold Mountain but with more depth, more life, more response.<br/><br/>The melodrama continued and all of a sudden, comes this powerful last third of Atonement. Romola Garai who plays the Briony at 18 who's performance is very responsive and spacious heats up the screen with poise and control. Garai who hasn't had success in with mediocre performances and films like Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and Vanity Fair finally is given some scenery to chew. Inhabiting the guilt and despondency of Briony was quite a task and sincere effort to bring her to the viewer with aggression yet subtlety was great.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley who has teamed up with Joe Wright before in his directorial debut is beautiful in elegance but nothing extroverted that makes you take her with you after the film ends. Her Romeo & Juliet story with McAvoy is the most tender parts of the movie however, disappointment is the only feeling I can describe to you, the reader, with her work here. With expectations so high maybe that was her downfall with myself.<br/><br/>Saoirse Ronan who has been reaping all the buzz is a talent to watch in the future but alas, I can't wallow in the glory of Ronan without feeling Garai is missing out on the glory. It is the best child performance of the year by far and her curiosity and crush on Robbie is special to the film; Ronan holds her own against the other talents in the film.<br/><br/>In the end, it's the wonderful veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave that steals the show and inhabits Older Briony which singled handedly saves the film in its entirety. All the melodrama and over zealous antics of the film were summed up in the finale and because of Redgrave it all made me swallow it a whole lot better. Redgrave holds all the tragedy of the film in her brief and final moments that encourage all of us to share in the love for all humanity. Thinking about all the things that you regret and wish you could change is the solution to the film Atonement. Atonement in the sense of the word, is needed in all our lives as the one thing that is a necessity but everyone hesitates to take. The film is a work of art.<br/><br/>Grade: ***½/****"

"Sweet_Ophelia","7","4","6","14 October 2007"," Impressive artistic endeavor
","'Atonement' tells the story of a series of unfortunate events, misinterpretations and consequences as 13 year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) accuses her childhood friend, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) of a terrible crime he did not commit. Opening in 1935, the story moves forward five years to show the repercussions of Briony's mistake on both Robbie and Briony's sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley), who abandons her family to stick by Robbie and wait for him, first to return from prison and then from war. 'Atonement' is an adaptation of Ian McEwan's hugely successful 2001 novel of the same name. Adapted by Christopher Hampton ('The Quiet American') and directed by Joe Wright ('Pride and Prejudice'), it is a sweeping saga of love and war, class consciousness, guilt and redemption. <br/><br/>Having read and thoroughly enjoyed McEwan's novel, I had high-hopes for this film  further fueled by my reading only the most glowing reviews after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year. But after watching the film, I've got to say I don't really see what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>The buzz is that Keira Knightley will receive another Oscar nod for her performance as the loyal lady in waiting, Cecilia Tallis as will James McAvoy for his role as the wrongly-accused Robbie Turner. I am a big fan of both Knightley and McAvoy. Knightley for her kudos-earning role as Elizabeth Bennett and McAvoy because he is just lovely, Scottish and has been on my radar since the British TV show 'Shameless'. However, both actors deliver fairly stoic performances by my reckoning. It's not entirely their fault, they are playing very class- conscious British characters who have to remember their social standing. And it is hard to play character's who have to say a lot without saying anything at all with regards to burgeoning romantic feelings. Neither are bad, but I wouldn't have said 'Oscar-worthy'. <br/><br/>The rumor-mill is also predicting a Best Director gong for Joe Wright and Best Picture for the film. Well, I can't really wrong the pre-emptive Best Director for Wright. Perhaps its because 'Atonement' sees him coupled with his muse, Ms. Knightley  but it's more likely that Wright is just a very talented director with an eye for atmosphere and understated beauty. A particularly breath-taking scene shows a panoramic view of desolate Dunkirk, over-run by soldiers waiting to go home, it is grandiose, detailed and absolutely magnificent. <br/><br/>The film as a whole however, will be a love/hate affair for many. I personally enjoyed the film, partly because it was a worthy adaptation of a beloved book  but I can admit that it was a little slow. True, outer turmoil is portrayed quite clearly by the war that Wright impressively recreates in London in 1940 and Dunkirk (not through battle scenes however), but so much of the story has to do with internal turmoil that it is sometimes hard to hold interest. However, Wright has to be applauded again for his managing to create suspense in certain scenes I thought would be very tricky to communicate to the audience  in particular, a certain letter writing scene. <br/><br/>The fall-backs of the film may lie in the fact that McEwan's novel is not adaptation friendly. That's not to say it isn't a good book  it is, brilliant even. However, the novel is narrated by an omniscient third person who is able to explain the inner-workings of each character, their motivations and interpretations of events. The narration is an important element to the book since the entire plot revolves around young Briony misinterpreting moments between Robbie and Cecilia. In the film however, Wright tries to position the audience in different frames of mind by showing the same scenes twice. One particular scene is first shown from Briony's perspective  through a window, silently seeing the tail-end of a seemingly heated exchange between her sister and childhood friend, Robbie which she perceives as malicious on Robbie's part. We then see the same scene more intimately and in its entirety, between Cecilia and Robbie and realize the sexual undertones and frustration of feelings unspoken between the characters. <br/><br/>I think my slight disappointment in the film comes from the fact that I did get my hopes up. It is a good film, Oscar-worthy? Only time will tell. I think it will be appreciated more as an artistic endeavor than a drama or love story, and will no doubt earn Joe Wright more critical acclaim and cachets as a director to watch, and rightly so."
"teh_mode","7","4","6","3 October 2007"," Weighty, ambitious and visually arresting, Atonement almost makes amends for its lack of dramatic weight
","Atonement is a film exploring the consequences of love, and the guilt one carries when attempting to destroy it. Starting in the hot British summer 1935, we join a courtship between Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis, told through the eyes of Cecilia's 13-year-old sister Briony. Peeking from inside a house window she views her sister stripping off in front of Robbie and then plunging herself into the fountain in the garden of their country house. By the end of the day their lives will have changed forever, as the scheming imagination of Briony will have run its rage over the lives of the two lovers.<br/><br/>Cecilia (Keira Knightley) has travelled down from Cambridge; Robbie (James McAvoy), her university contemporary and son of her parents' housekeeper is dabbling with landscape gardening; and her brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) is coming to dinner with a friend, the arrogant industrialist Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch). The performances are enjoyable and spot-on: Cecilia's brittle beauty; Robbie's educated but tempered confidence; the wily camaraderie between Leon and Marshall.<br/><br/>Cecilia clearly harbours an attraction to her university contemporary, but her inherent snobbishness towards his attachment to the more servile classes stilt her feelings somewhat. The class divide is tested even further, when her younger sibling Briony (a fantastic turn from Saoirse Ronan), who herself is dabbling in the arts of playwriting and novels, envelops her own imagination with a warped perception of their relationship. Robbie is branded a ""sex maniac"" and accused of raping Briony's friend and cousin Lola (Juno Temple). The accusations and stigma will haunt Briony, Cecilia and Robbie for the rest of their lives, the next chapter of which follows them through World War II. Briony, staring at her deathbed in the contemporary era, attempts to atone for her guilt by writing what she really saw, and what really happened during the summer of 1935.<br/><br/>Joe Wright, at the age of 35, clearly has a interesting future ahead of him There are times during Atonement when the style and flourish of the film's movement is elevated through its direction. He sees his films intricately and along with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey paints them vastly and beautifully. When he made Pride & Prejudice, the popular call was that he had made Jane Austen ""muddy"", despite the fact it was as pastorally arresting as any of Austen's novel's should be. Atonement is the same. It switches from the beauty of the Tallis country home to the grotty urbanism of wartime London with equal aplomb. He is clearly a director with an interesting style of film-making, but it is questionable whether he is utilises his gifts appropriately during the film. One sequence, a breathtaking long-take following Robbie's worn-out soldier walking along one of the French beaches, is both visually arresting and technically marvellous. But all it accumulates to is visual swaggery on Wright's part. What Atonement lacks in buckets is the kind of emotional attachment any loves story desperately relies. Wright attempting to make up for the general lack of involvement in these latter sequences resorts to showing off his technical hands, maybe hoping we haven't noticed how engaging the story is getting. It is a darn shame, far too much of one unfortunately, since the ambition and weight of Atonement make a movie you will want to love. Some people do, and it leads me to question my own interpretation of the film that they something out of it to treasure. But in my opinion there are far too many problems that match the movie's huge ambition. Keira Knightly, for all her hard work, doesn't possess the dramatic weight to make us feel for her character. Far too often is the pain lacking, when it is clear we are meant to be heartbroken at both her's and her lover's fate. I wanted to feel the sorrow of her character, and the closest you come to that is through the guilt and anguish displayed through Romola Garai's performance as the wartime Briony.<br/><br/>When the end reveals itself, it is genuinely moving, but a part of me felt as though the film had not earned the right to take me to that place. I still feel there is a great movie to be made on this subject, one that overcomes the literary trappings of the novel, and doesn't give distance to the audience through its more dramatic scenes. I still think people should see it, there is enough worth discussing and much to be admired. It is a beautiful, ambitious and weighty failure. One that will stay with you after you've seen it."

","I was so excited to go and see Atonement. Friends told me to bring a box of Kleenex, that it was a tragic love story, that it was just fantastic! So I went, and found here wasn't any love in this story, no reasons for crying, and no real atonement. What on earth makes people think that lust and love are the same thing, and even lust was sparse in this film. The sets and costumes were lush and nice, but the method of presenting the story was so jumbled it was pathetic. I couldn't get to know, or care about anyone, except for the really mentally sick little girl who needed treatment. <br/><br/>What a disappointment! I wanted to love it. I hated it. The director went overboard trying to be artsy fartsy so people who didn't know better, thought it was real art. Where have all the wonderful types of movies that were made in the late 30's, 40's and 50's? Movies that make you feel something about the characters, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you understand what the heck they are all about? There are just two movies nominated that are worthy of an Oscar, this certainly isn't one of them."

In fact, I was mortified. Some people left the audience after this and the library scene.<br/><br/>While the cinematography was beautiful in parts, there remain aspects of the movie I have yet to understand: The French soldier speaking to Briony in the hospital, the beach scene with the soldiers, and others. I just don't understand how they contributed to the movie except to add to its length. It was gory in the hospital scenes, too.<br/><br/>Overall, I wish I hadn't wasted my time seeing this movie.

"wheeler_charles","3","7","13","27 May 2008"," Unbelievable!
","Unfortunately, this film is unbelievable in the less charitable sense of the word.<br/><br/>It is holed below the waterline by the same deficiencies that, for me, sank the novel. Ian McEwan seems to lead a charmed life as a Booker banker, but the reasons remain puzzling. He can certainly write well, if unexceptionally, but his plot lines are full of the kind of incredible conceits that are difficult to take seriously. As a result their professed moral import turns to dust on the slightest scrutiny.<br/><br/>In this case the mistakenly sent letter and, more outrageously still, the false accusation, serve as McGuffins to generate the narrative, but undermine any kind of moral consistency. Is it possible that a precocious and impressionable young girl could deliberately accuse another of such a crime out of a fit of jealous pique? Well, conceivably. Is it possible that a family that had taken the accused under its wing, educated him at great expense and sought to secure his future, take that accusation without any real investigation (in the book or the film)? Not conceivably. As a result of the ineptitude with which this situation is portrayed, the rest of the film loses any sense of tension or interest.<br/><br/>The final section, with the fictionalised fiction(!), which comes off much better in the book, worked less well in the film, while the stilted and contrived 'interview' simply came across as a rather desperate bit of exposition. And ultimately, the idea that Briony could 'atone' for her behaviour by writing a happy ending to the tale of two destroyed lives bears little examination - rendering the whole novel/film otiose.<br/><br/>I can't fault the direction, which is what one would expect of a traditional approach to a traditional novel. The acting, of what was a pretty undemanding script, was fine, but hardly Oscar material. Which leaves one pondering as to how it has garnered so many accolades."
"AgedInWood","4","7","13","13 April 2008"," I must read the book.... because the movie made no sense
","The first 45 minutes of this movie were quite good and after that it went downhill fast. I loved the premise of a young girl's lie bringing people to ruin. So our movie starts with a young, precocious girl named Briony Tallis spying on and envying her sister, Cecelia. When Cecelia takes up with the housekeeper's son, Robbie, Briony catches them in the act which fuels her jealousy and sets the scene for Briony to later accuse Robbie of raping a young house guest. What a web is spun driving these two lovers apart! But you could see the cracks early on. I did not altogether buy that these two love each other. The only testimony to it was their speaking the words as they copulate against a bookcase. Not exactly the stuff of love. No mention was ever made about the young girl who was raped until much later in the film. She was an interesting character, wise beyond her years but still just a girl. I found her rape disturbing and it was completely swept under the rug. Our hero, Robbie, is quickly carted off to jail and from there, the story turns into a mess.<br/><br/>Once Robbie trades jail for war and the sisters Tallis become nurses, the whole plot is fantastical. The Dunkirk scene for me was a token war scene that allowed the director to paint a surreal portrait of war that makes no sense. I couldn't decide what the hell I was watching...was it the director's love for his way-too-long money shot or was it Robbie's hallucinations from his septicemia? Shooting horses, soldiers riding a ferris wheel, singing in a gazebo - utter nonsense. And where on earth did the black British soldier come from? <br/><br/>At the end we learn through an elderly Briony, who has finished writing her novel Atonement, that she has put her own spin on events because her sister and Robbie both died during the war. I realized the last hour and a half was a complete waste of time save the performance of Vanessa Redgrave, which was superb.<br/><br/>Did Robbie and Cecilia really meet at the café after he was released from jail? Who knows? Was there a house by the sea? Who knows? Did the lovers really keep in touch? Who knows? Did Robbie wander the war torn French countryside with a cockney and a black man? Who knows? How much of it was Briony's version of events and how much of it happened? Who knows? The pseudo-artsy plot hopping was distracting and the lack of character development made it impossible to care what happened to any of these people. The director opted for gruesome imagery to symbolize the potential outcome of lying - murdered school girls, burned bodies, shell shocked soldiers, missing limbs and most interesting of all, a two room flat next to a pig sty (the ultimate depiction of how far an upper middle class girl has fallen).<br/><br/>The director spends a good deal of time on the war when it would have been far more interesting to see how Briony's lie changed her through the years. Did she testify against Robbie at trial? What were the parting words between her and her sister? What did she do before she became a nurse? How did she learn of her sister's death? Did she ever confront Lola and Paul? The finest scene in the movie was Briony sitting with the dying French soldier and this alone is why we should have seen more of Briony's personal atonement. I hope the book is better."

","There are no words that can describe my anger over this film's win at the Golden Globes for best picture.

I also give credit to the screenwriter and director for the first 15 minutes of the movie. Everything after that, amounts to one of the biggest piles of rubbish I have ever seen celebrated on screen.<br/><br/>The problem is the story itself- it's obvious that neither the writer, director, or James MacAvoy, have any CLUE what it's like to go to war or be in love. The film is entirely self-absorbed and completely unaware of the catastrophic historical events that surround it. James McAvoy also cries in every scene of the movie that he's in, including the fountain scene and the scene where they make love--this is just horrific acting and directing. It's also disrespectful to make a movie that unrealistic and soppy on issues that are real and dark.<br/><br/>I wanted to vomit after leaving the theater.

It's a beautiful story and the casting and sets and staging are wonderful, almost to the point of distraction.<br/><br/>My only complaints were a ""Hallmark card"" type of scene at the end of Cecelia and Robbie happily cavorting on a beach (very NOT Ian McEwan's style)and the decision NOT to include the final scene of the book, where Briony's very young cousins finally stage her play, ""The Trials of Arabella"" which started the story going 60+ years earlier.

Characters move in and out of the story so quickly, it is difficult to keep everyone straight. On the positive side, the costumes were lovely and the setting of the movie was gorgeous. The aging of the 13 year old writer to the older author was also well done. On the whole, however, I was very disappointed by this movie and would not recommend seeing it."

This movie is a post-modern fantasy devoid, like the art movement itself, of any critical moment! It ransacks history for the most vivid backdrop it can find. Need a war, well let's just throw in Dunkirk and stitch the whole thing together with a five and a half minute pretentious tracking shot in which the whining love lost lead character stumbles around in a petty-bourgeois tantrum.

"Doylenf","8","6","11","9 April 2008"," Magnificent love story given the Ivory-Merchant kind of treatment...
","ATONEMENT ranks as one of the classiest love stories told in recent years, boosted by some brilliant color photography, a lyrical background score, a well crafted script, and some fine ensemble performances. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY sometimes falters with her too clipped way of speaking and throwing away important lines, but otherwise the cast is impeccable.<br/><br/>Basically it's a dreamy looking tale of a wealthy family enjoying the summer days in the English countryside and there are hints of a gentle romance going on between a rather snobbish young woman (Knightley) and a handyman at her father's estate (JAMES McAVOY). Their obvious infatuation with each other only incites jealousy in her younger sister Briony (amazing performance from SAOIRSE RONAN), who happens to spy on them from an upper window. She's a girl who once threw herself at the young man by pretending to drown so that he would jump in and rescue her. He does, but is annoyed when he realizes she purposely pretended to drown.<br/><br/>From that point on, the plot moves forward and backward in a structure that never becomes clumsy even though it moves between past events and present to tell the tale of how a single lie changes the course of three lives. In director Joe Wright's hands, the tale never becomes maudlin or too complicated to follow and we see the development of strong characters and are satisfied, by the conclusion, that the tale has been told in a very effective way.<br/><br/>VANESSA REDGRAVE comes in toward the end, as the older version of the young woman who told a lie, and she has some surprising comments to make that wind up the tale in an oddly affecting way.<br/><br/>The standout performances are given by SAOIRSE RONAN as young Briony and JAMES McAVOY. McAvoy is impressive throughout, totally in command of a difficult role, almost emotionally draining in the film's detailed war scenes that have him wandering around in an almost shell-shocked manner. His confrontational moments with the eighteen year-old Briony (RAMOLA GARAI) are brilliantly played by both performers.<br/><br/>Many stories have been told where a lie at the very center plays a part in extending the whole tale. This one is very powerful and yet, at the core, remains a tender love story of tremendous emotional depth.<br/><br/>The background score by Dario Marianelli , distinguished by lots of piano music, is highly effective in creating the many changing moods of the multi-layered story."

","At this point, I have seen too many great films to be enchanted by long and beautiful shots accompanied by moving music. And I agree, Atonement was visually beautiful. But many scenes dragged on long after it conveyed both the plot and emotions. The final scene was a painfully abrupt change of tone. The acting of both the Bryony's was excellent. And McAvoy was great as expected (but Last King of Scotland topped). The manipulation of time with young Bryony was well done in that it conveyed the childhood innocence and juvenile misinterpretations. A movie I would recommend with similar setting is ""A Very Long Engagement."" Overall: Entertaining, very emotional, and well acted."

Every hackneyed film-school trick is employed in this ""English Patient""-meets-""Roshamon""-meets-""Jacob's Ladder""-meets-""Manon des Sources"" bore.

","The bits I liked first. Both the leads were better than I'd anticipated, particularly Kiera, who I've not had much time for as her previous attempts have been stilted and wooden in some cases. She's matured into a nice actress and her part came across as very believable. James McAvoy likewise did a great job although his accent was quite variable. Vanessa Redgrave was simply stunning. Her role was made difficult because it was so small and so important. Every moment had to be convincing and it was perfectly judged. I hadn't read the book which I'm glad about and I shall now go out and buy it. The story was fabulous with a stunning ending which I think would have been spoiled if you'd already read the book. This needs to be a shock and I'd imagine its anticipation would only water its effects down. What wasn't so good was the directors inconsistent handling of the script. There were some nice scenes when the two leads played together but there were also too many scenes that were heavy handed and a few quite laughable. The most expensive scene in the film on the Dunquerk beach was horrendously camp and self aware which was a shame. You could almost see the AD's q'ing the cast, horse and dog handlers and viz effects guys. There was also some dodgy casting and the guy who married Lola needed a quick word in his ear about his woodeness. It's probably not in the book but I would have liked a few more scenes of the two leads together to show their attraction to one another. We needed a little more detail of their depth of feeling so their separation is more poignant. Overall the film was a little frustrating because with a better director it could have been a great film but his heavy handedness got in the way too many times."
"JediMoonShyne2","5","7","14","2 October 2007"," A well-packaged semi-failure
","'Atonement' Joe Wright, 2007<br/><br/>To begin with, I should start by mentioning that I'm firmly situated in the minority - being that I haven't read Ian McEwan's bestselling novel upon which this film is based. Now that this seemingly relevant piece of information has been divulged, I can commence properly.<br/><br/>The idea of the 'love story' is as old as time itself. Indeed, peril-fraught romances have had theater-dwellers wiping their eyes for as long as cinema has existed. Romantical films that attempt to pull an audience member into a given tale of quivering bosoms and parted lips, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. History dictates that most of these pictures focus upon a central relationship, and Joe Wright's 'Atonement' upholds this standard. We follow the trials of Cecilia and Robbie - one a wealthy yet bored young heiress to a mansion in England's thirties, the other a son of this mansion's paid servant-family. Their fate is somehow determined by 13-year-old Briony Tallis. Younger sister to Cecilia and as fantastical as you they come. Although this character is key to the plot, the film itself focuses on the young couple, hoping to encourage empathy for their plight - for the ultimate injustice of their lives. It is however clear to me that when attempting to inspire some kind of feeling within your audience, you should start at the very root of the passion - at the grass-green shoots of love. 'Atonement' does anything but this, mentioning the central relationship offhandedly before hurling itself into a tale more lustful than love-full. And one that seems to have very little foundation. I simply cannot comprehend the decision to base a film upon a relationship to which you are going to spend no time rearing - or even detailing why it exists. Leaving this quite critical preamble up to viewer perception, before throwing said relationship to the wolves and expecting your entire audience to dive in after it.<br/><br/>So begins a tale of envy, jealousy, bravery, lust, and pride. We are introduced to and released from 'Atonement' through the eyes of younger sister Briony. Who sets the wheels in motion so spectacularly with her unfounded yet life-changing accusations. Much of the events that occur in the film seem unpredictable, making it even more surprising then that the plot itself comes off as rather linear. An inadequacy that director Wright attempts to distract from by altering the film's timeline, often unnecessarily. The acting on show is altogether unremarkable and unabsorbing, with Miss Knightley's well-practiced pout as metallic as it ever was. James McAvoy who shares the lead does well enough with what he's given, but neither actress nor actor are aided by a plot that is somewhat transparent in places. This lack of plot-strength is stunningly covered up however by some quite beautiful cinematography. The entire film is confidently shot with a graceful style, and without giving too much away there is a certain singular long take focusing on Dunkirk beach that will make the eyes water (in a good way). That said, it had no bearing on the story itself - neither did it convince me that the oft-glaring plot holes could be ignored for more than a few pretty and technically wonderful minutes. 'Atonement' is a well-packaged semi-failure. It flaunts romance that has very little foundation or means to deserve empathy, yet it does so while trying to breath new life into a genre it has so utterly forgotten the fundamentals of.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Galina_movie_fan","9","5","9","9 April 2008"," One of the best films of 2007
","I've seen four films from last year that were nominated for Best Picture, and I liked ""Atonement"" (2007) the most. I read the book when it was first published back in 2001, liked it but did not think of it much before the movie was released. I did not rush to the theater to see ""Atonement"" - mostly because it was universally compared to ""The English Patient"". I sat through ""The English Patient"" once and decided that I would not want to see it again. Well, to make the long story short, I rented ""Atonement"" when it was released on DVD, and to my utter delight, it turned to be the Best movie of last year. Its first part, 45 minutes in the Tallis's family estate that depict one long hot summer day in 1935, the day that had dramatically and tragically changed the future of the film's many characters, is simply cinematic triumph. The atmosphere of sexual tension, of longing, of discovering love and immediate losing it forever has been recreated masterfully. The first third of the film depends a lot on the inner monologues, body languages, on the differences in ability to see something and to interpret it. I found director's choice in showing the same events from different points of view very creative and appropriate for this kind of cinematic story telling. I was very impressed by Dario Marianelli's Oscar winning score that used the sound of typewriter as a leitmotif. I found it very fitting for the film which is about a devastating power of word that could be the deadliest weapon of all. Shrapnel and bombs just finished the deed that three simple words had started on the evening of one hot summer in 1935. I found the middle part of the film somewhat weaker, not as intense with the emotional impact as the first part until one mournful tragic scene of the war's horror as seen through Robbie's eyes. Once again I was fascinated by the director's and young actor's art of saying much without a word.<br/><br/>In the movie with no single bad performance, we are rewarded in the final with short but memorable appearance of Vanessa Redgrave who as one of my friends commented, has ""only her face, eyes, and voice to work with."" But this is an actress whom Katharine Hepburn favored over all actresses and remarked that she was ""A thrill to look at and to listen to."" The short epilogue with Redgrave brings the movie to the same high level as its amazingly artful opening part. After I finished watching ""Atonement"", the first thing I did  I placed the hold for ""The English Patient"". Ten years is a long time. Maybe I'll see it differently now. Or maybe the fact that Anthony Minghella who had interviewed Redgrave's character in the last scene of ""Atonement"", suddenly and untimely passed away last March had added to my decision to re-visit his film."
"hannah8700-1","10","5","9","6 April 2008"," A Love That Endures All!
","There are not enough words to describe how truly amazing this movie is! It was exceptional and most definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Every scene is breathtaking. The director really brought McEwan's words alive and stayed true to his story. You are taken into the mind of young Briony Tallis whose innocence, imagination and childhood fantasies changes the lives of everyone around her. With one simple lie, one small accusation, she destroys the lives of the two people she cares for the most. James McAvoy and Keira Knightley were in a league entirely of their own. Their performances as Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis were phenomenal. They had that spark and that chemistry that really make the movie what it is. But I must say that James McAvoy was both the lead role and star of the film. I love him in every movie he's ever been a part of! As an actor he possesses the talent and ability to invoke emotion in you from every scene. He can make you laugh one minute and cry the next. He is truly talented. Some of the most powerful scenes are when he is in the war just trying to make it back to the woman he loves and thinking about her every step of his journey. The scene where he comes across a field of dead school children and begins to cry was very moving. And then there's the scene where's he's just lying there at night looking at the picture of the cottage until the match goes out, wanting so much to be home there with her. That was another tear jerker! One of my favorite scenes too was right after Cecilia comes up from the water and grabs the broken vase out of his hand and he just watches her walk away and then he goes over to the fountain and lays his hand on top of the water, just to be close to her. That was another really beautiful scene. But what I loved the most was how much they both loved each other and all he wanted to do was just get back to her so that they could be together and I hate that they never got that chance. The ending truly shocked me. I really thought that everything was going to turn out the way it was supposed to and that Briony would change her testimony and he would finally be cleared of any shame or reproach that he suffered because of her. And I really thought they were going to get married and live happily ever after because they so rightly deserved a happy ending. Then come to find out that Briony never had the courage or the decency to go and see her sister that day to try and make things right. Her character irritated me so much, not just because she lied but because she was a coward and she ruined two people's lives without cause or reason. She could have fixed what she'd done but she chose not to. She only wrote that last book at the end because of her guilty conscience but even then what she did all those years ago was still unforgivable. Still, I'm glad that despite all the odds that were against them they got a chance to see each other that one time in the café, and despite it all they still loved each other all the same- maybe more even. However, even as evil as it sounds, I am glad that they both died in the end so that one didn't have to suffer all the pain and heartache alone and go through life without the other. I did like the very last scene too. It gave you a sense of closure and was exactly how it should really have been. All in all, ""Atonement"" is a love story and one that stands the test of time and endures a lie, the horrors of war and even death. It was heartbreaking, but then again most great love stories usually are."

"DonFishies","7","5","9","3 February 2008"," A visually exquisite film that could have been so much better
","Atonement tells the story of Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year-old fledging writer and member to a family of wealthy British socialites in the 1930's. She has a crush on the hired help in the much older Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), but she notices that her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) seems to have similar feelings. But after reading a letter by chance and witnessing some rather disturbing events, Briony changes the course of life for more than just a few people.<br/><br/>I was not quite sure what I was expecting going into Atonement, but the movie I saw was not it. I do not necessarily think this is a bad thing, but I do think it helps to know very little about it. Yes, it is very romantic in a handful of scenes, but it so much more darkly mysterious than the ad material lets on. Just the sheer notion of the course of events that leads up to Briony's irrevocable change is quite disturbing all in itself.<br/><br/>Atonement has a rather enigmatic method of sequencing. Falling quite distinctly beside the likes of Akira Kurosawa's Rashômon and Zhang Yimou's obvious homage Hero, Atonement tells its story from a few points of view, showcasing a few events through multiple angles. What is great is that we actually get to see these angles from the very point-of-view of the character, almost to the point of being a voyeur (much like Briony herself). It makes for an intriguing of watching the film, and it leads to a greater of understanding of the motivations of each of the main characters. It may not be easy for casual filmmakers to understand the use of seeing these angles used more than few times early on, but it does truly make sense as the film goes on, and is not simply a British upper class nod to those Asian filmmakers.<br/><br/>The story itself, while being heavily convoluted (in part thanks to the really well done multiple angles), is a bit off. I liked where it went, and I like how it explored what happened to the characters (since the first half is almost entirely comprised of the day of Briony's big moment), but its focus seemed a bit wonky. I realize and understand what screenwriter Ian McEwan (and in turn, novelist Christopher Hampton) was trying to capture and achieve in the writing, but it works half of the time. I found myself more baffled at the lengths some of these scenes rather ridiculous, and just disliked how it was so careless with its moments of exploration and development. The characters do develop over the course of the film, but just not to the point that the film lends itself to thinking they do.<br/><br/>What I also did not like was the length. The first half goes by fairly quickly, but the second half just drags endlessly. A lot of the strongest scenes in the film, and the ones I liked the most, are in the second half, but the filmmakers just seem to have less of a idea as to what they wanted to do with them. They know how to make them look great, but making them play off just as good seems to be a bit of a problem. It is disappointing to think so much effort was put into the early moments, but not enough was given to the later ones. It does not help that the first half does not jump around nearly as much as the second, but the film does not seem balanced. Once the ending hits, the film practically flies, but getting there is almost a test of endurance in itself.<br/><br/>The beautiful imagery stays consistent throughout the film, even at its darkest (both literally and figuratively) moments. Director Joe Wright and company have composed a gorgeous looking film, with minute details at every corner and just the right amount of authenticity. Some of the scenes they compose are simply breathtaking as well. One long take late in the film in war torn France is simply fantastic, and speaks volumes of the level of effort put into making the film. It reminded me a lot of the amazingly captured scenes in Children of Men, and I think it qualifies as some of the best sequencing of the year. I was very impressed with the visuals, and I think they helped keep my eyes peeled to the screen and not faltering into the boredom that sets in because of the story. The typewriter infused score is also very well done, and quite riveting at times.<br/><br/>The acting from the cast is uniformly good, with some standouts. After being disappointed with his work in The Last King of Scotland, McAvoy really knocked my socks off here. His wounded character is very well conveyed, and truly proves his worth as an up and coming actor. No, it is nowhere near as good as the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Viggo Mortensen, Johnny Depp or even Denzel Washington, but it is great all in its own. I can only hope he continues on this streak. Knightley on the other hand, is not all that great. She does fairly well for herself, but she does not seem to be giving it her all. I am not going to say that her acting is bad here, it just does not seem to be up to the calibre the film is trying to project.<br/><br/>Ronan is the true marvel here (and miles ahead of Briony's older forms in Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave), and outshines everyone in the cast. Her naivety and amazing style speaks of being a more seasoned veteran, and I hope she can continue on this wave length for The Lovely Bones and beyond.<br/><br/>In the end, Atonement is a good film that could have been a whole lot better. If for anything, see it for the astonishing visuals and the even better Ronan.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

","On Boxing Day me and my family went to the movies to watch Atonement. I didn't think of it much as I do now but it really made me feel saddened deep inside. This was the best Drama flick i had seen since American Beauty.<br/><br/>The movie had wonderful performances by the unknown and known actors and actresses. At some scenes you feel confused with the time that the current part is set in. This movie has changed my view completely on Drama Movies. The way that the film was directed it is visible that the performers were into the storyline. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley showed excellence in acting along with James McAvoy. Though the film is an R, what would a good emotional film be rated? PG? This has got to be right up in the best movies of all time... near Titanic"
"eastbergholt2002","10","5","9","15 December 2007"," Great Movie
","Movies don't get much better than Atonement. It was nice to watch a critically acclaimed film that left you surprised by its power and intelligence, usually it's the other way around. Atonement is a beautifully told love story that is both gripping and tragic. <br/><br/>Without going into too much detail, the story shares some common elements with the English Patient. Both are based on acclaimed novels and include a pair of star-crossed lovers. Both stories are set before and during the Second World War and feature military hospitals, aristocratic men in tuxedos and a British army in retreat from the Germans. Another key similarity is a beautiful upper class English woman who falls in love with an outsider and finds herself punished by events beyond her control. <br/><br/>Joe Wright is a wonderful director and the cinematography and look of the film are impressive. Keira Knightley and James McAvoy are both excellent. The period dialog by Ian McEwan and Christopher Hampton was smart and refreshing. Highly recommend."
"the_Poppuns","10","5","9","14 December 2007"," I didn't know until the very end
","how much I loved this movie. And I have to say it forced tears out of me quite violently. What a beautiful film.<br/><br/>As you can tell from the trailers this story is about the consequences of a misunderstanding. I don't know if people realize how much damage something like this can do. In the movies, it almost never happens. People say and do the right things all the time unless it's funny then wackiness ensues. But in real life it happens all the time. I almost wonder if some people will think that these things don't really happen and that it makes the movie unrealistic just because they're not used to seeing it.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film itself is beautiful and there is an incredibly amazing sequence when they get to a beach. It goes on for a few minutes and I really thought that was breathtaking. I don't think I'm familiar with the director but he did some great work. He and the cinematographer, because to look at it, it's just sumptuous. The cast was also amazing. A few different actresses played the young girl at different stages and I don't know if they really look that much alike or if I just bought into it because the movie was so absorbing, but they all did fantastic work. James McAvoy has one of those faces, it's so clear. You can't stop looking at him, kinda the same way you can't stop looking at Al Pacino. He was under-appreciated in 'The Last King of Scotland' so I'm glad to see he's getting some attention for another great role. And Keira Knightley continues to surprise me. Beautiful as she is she could just kick back and do a lot of vanity projects and collect Pirates royalties, but she continues to prove herself as an actress.<br/><br/>This movie will be loved by people who love a film like 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'The English Patient'. It's not as long as those but it fits into that epic love story genre. And Zhivago is on my very short list of favorites so I wouldn't say that lightly. There are some graphic scenes but of war wounds. Not the kind of graphic I was expecting. And there is one very bad word in it that becomes somewhat of a focal point. But if you're a mature individual who doesn't mind those things and who enjoys classic film with war and romance then this is most likely for you."

NOT THIS TIME. I was completely affected by this movie from beginning to end. Most critics in New York have been very good, and careful, about not revealing too much of this epic story.

From the lush country-side mansion to a gorgeous Knightley and a handsome James McAvoy, it's just visual poetry. These two create such chemistry between their characters, that it seems obvious why they would wait for each other.<br/><br/>The story is nuanced, beautifully translated from Ian McEwan's novel and Joe Wright MUST get a best director nod and win. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley has come a long way from her ""Bend it like Beckham"" days. She was outstanding in ""Pride and Prejudice"", but THIS is the defining role for her, she is superb and absolutely nails it. She plays Cecilia as a conflicted young woman and her accent is right on the money. This is her best performance to date and deserves a Golden Globe and Oscar nod. She will be robbed if she doesn't get both!<br/><br/>Similarly, James McAvoy is wonderful in this movie. What this man can say with one look is incredible.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","5","9","16 September 2007"," A decent adaptation (spoilers throughout)
","My main problem with the film adaptation of Atonement, like the novel, is the ending. Here we have a character, Briony Tallis, who as a thirteen-year-old girl splits up a young couple and sends a young man, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), to jail by falsifying evidence. Years later she realises what she did was wrong and tries to atone for her mistakes. But the way that she tries to do it seems wrong to me.<br/><br/>You see, Briony is a writer, and as a precocious thirteen-year-old girl she attempts to put on a play called The Trials of Arabella. Full of self-importance it promises to be a ridiculous piece. But then as a successful writer, and diagnosed with a terminal disease, she writes a novel about her experiences  about the way she destroyed a burgeoning love affair. She claims it's entirely autobiographical. And before this we have a powerful scene where an eighteen-year-old Briony, now a nurse in the Second World War, confronts the couple she attempted to split up (the woman in the relationship, played by Keira Knightley, is her sister). Full of anger and regret, it shows how Briony is trying to make things up. She wants to right the wrongs she made.<br/><br/>But then as the older Briony talks at the end, we find out, even though she said the entire book was autobiographical, that this scene is a fiction. Briony never really met her sister during the war. She never met Robbie. Indeed, Robbie never even made it back from Dunkirk. He died of septicaemia. And Cecilia (Knightley) died in an Underground station during the Blitz. What kind of atonement is this? It's meant to be some kind of offering to the world, to show how glorious their love could be. And it's also meant to be a way of immortalising their love, to allow them to live on. But personally, I think it suggests that Briony hasn't learnt a single thing. She's still the silly little girl living in her dream world. She still can't accept reality. In fact, the old Briony explains her reasons for not including the actual events by saying it wouldn't be satisfactory for her readers. Well, maybe it wouldn't, but at least, for once, it would be the truth  a novel concept for the rather wretched Briony Tallis.<br/><br/>Aside from this, though, I enjoyed the film. And I even have to say that the ending moved me somewhat. But it didn't move me because of Briony's 'atonement'. It moved me because Robbie and Cecilia's love was never fulfilled. There's something touching about the banality of Robbie's death, that such a strong will to survive and that such a determined desire to return home can be extinguished so easily.<br/><br/>Another moving scene is the one where an eighteen-year-old Briony has to comfort a dying French soldier. I can remember it being the most powerful scene in the novel, and it's equally powerful here. I think it's the first time that Briony ever realises what love really is, that it isn't a selfish need to possess another human being (her betrayal of Robbie is entirely motivated by feelings of rejection) but a simple desire to make another person happy. Therefore, when she talks to this dying soldier, a man who's delirious and who seems to think that he knows her from the past, you get a proper sense that she's atoning for her mistakes. I really think it's near impossible for her to untangle the mess she made with Robbie and Cecilia, but the simple way she says 'Yes' when the young soldier asks her whether she loves him is so sweet and kind and unselfish that you feel that she's finally beginning to act selflessly.<br/><br/>However, my favourite scene in the film occurs when Robbie enters Dunkirk. There's a wonderfully cinematic sequence where the camera floats through the beach and into the town. Around you soldiers lie down to sleep, others fight and some even congregate to sing. And then in the background you have drunk soldiers staggering about and others destroying machinery and vehicles so that the Germans can't use them. It's done in such a simple, elegant way. Plus it economically communicates the despair and desperation of the situation. These men can almost see home  they can almost see it on the horizon  but it still seems so far away.<br/><br/>It's curious, though, that while, in the novel, I wasn't particularly inspired by the Dunkirk sequence, I loved the opening. But in the film I feel it's the weakest section. For me it just didn't have the claustrophobia, the passion and the intensity it has in the book. But maybe the film was always going to struggle with this section  in writing you can kind of tolerate the young Briony, but brought to life she's rather wretched and annoying. Plus Keira Knightley is never totally convincing. She doesn't embarrass herself, but she does lack charm and sex appeal. And she also has a habit of trying too hard  just look at her mouth when she says ""come back to me"" to Robbie; her lips look almost disfigured, she's trying so hard to impress. But when she relaxes, she actually fairly capable. There's a lovely little moment when she holds Robbie's hand. There's no pouting, no exaggeration  just a nice bit of warmth and feeling.<br/><br/>But these problems aside, Atonement is a decent adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel. I certainly don't think it should be involved in the upcoming Oscar race, but it deserves to be kindly remembered."

I hated this movie and I came to a conclusion that that the movie got over rating just because we like to follow.

"mr_whole_wheat","2","6","12","20 April 2008"," Awful
","This movie fails because of 1. Slow pacing. There were many unnecessary shots, and some of the more beautiful shots that were meant to give objective correlatives to the emotion the actors and audience are supposed to feel were overlong by seconds (the slow zoom from inside a door frame to James McAvoy outside) to to minutes (the painfully long Dunkirk beach scene). 2. Weak narrative structure. Almost every scene we see given to us en media res, in the middle of things, forcing the audience to patiently wait for explanation of circumstance, and without such explanation these circumstances hold no apparent significance. If these explanations were not so slow in coming, and if every scene didn't feel so excruciatingly overshot and protracted, then perhaps the narrative structure would have given me a sense of movement. Instead I often felt like the story was going nowhere, holding me down in a tepid bath of inconsequential detail. 3. The replacement of story with objects, scenes, vistas. While slow coming, the beginning of the movie does have a story to tell--there is both action and consequence and characters we start to care about. After Robbie is arrested and sent to fight in the war, the story is incredibly insipid: The English are retreating and Robbie misses his lover. In order to pad this--the worst part of the film--we are given utterly unnecessary scenes of Robbie's fellow soldiers delaying the story with inconsequential dialog. These are meant to give the story character, color and realism, but they fail ultimately because we could care less about these other soldiers--they are flat; in fact, everything in the film from arrest to imaginary return to England is flat in terms of the story--it is all visuals. These images instead of being a succession of pictures each worth a thousand words become a tedious one note melodrama: War is ugly and boy does it suck that Robbie and Cee were unjustly separated. Ugh, boring!<br/><br/>With some judicious editing and the inclusion of an engaging subplot in France, this could have been a much better film."

","I'm a huge James McAvoy fan and on discovering that he was making this (through IMDb no less), I decided to read the book before the film came out. I really liked the book and thought it would make an excellent film as certain chapters were too long and unnecessary. What a fine film it has indeed made.<br/><br/>McAvoy is particularly powerful as Robbie Turner a character who completely transforms during the film and who you root for constantly. Saoirse Ronan too is amazing (both Ronan and McAvoy pull off perfect upper class English accents)as is Romola Garai. The only weak link is Keira Knightly who I really dislike as an actress as she is stiff and limited but the film is really about Briony and Robbie's journeys and so her performance isn't particularly crucial.<br/><br/>The cinematography is spectacular (THE Dunkirk sequence is breathtaking), the chemistry between the leads is perfect (The scene where they meet over tea fizzles with tension and is one of my favourite scenes)and the score is completely right. The writing and direction fit the plot, setting and acting perfectly and Joe Wright is a director to watch for in the future.<br/><br/>So far my favourite film of the year by miles and I'm hoping both the film and McAvoy & Ronan receive the recognition they deserve at the Oscars next year.<br/><br/>Highly recommended A++"

","This movie was an odd experience. It is obviously a very expensive production, with thousands of extras, and for example Dunkirk being acted out in front of our eyes! And the same with the scenes from the London hospital and the air raid shelter in the London Underground: the costumes, settings, props, and everything are perfect. As a period piece this movie is excellent, and you can really learn something from it!<br/><br/>Another thing I liked a lot, was that the French were really speaking French (and not English, which is so common in war movies - even the Germans usually speak English...). This added to the feeling of reality. There is also some wonderful music in the movie, that gets your pulses going.<br/><br/>BUT... the problem is that the story in itself does not come up to the expectations you get from all the above. One believes that one is watching a movie that shall turn out to be GREAT... but that does never happen. And as one gets to expect so much, the disappointment is bigger. The story is after all the most important thing in a movie - it cannot live only on perfect settings. <br/><br/>At the same time, the subject matter is not THAT uninteresting. It made me remember when I was about the same age, and something similar happened to two girls I knew. They both had an infatuation for a riding master, and in a diary they wrote down their sexual fantasies about him. This diary was found by the mother of one of the girls, who phoned the police. The girls were so embarrassed about the sexual fantasies, that they rather let on that it had all happened in reality. The poor riding master went through Hell for several months, before he was acquitted - and he could not work at the riding school anymore, because some parents were still thinking ""no smoke without fire"". So - I found Brianna's actions psychologically correct.<br/><br/>I think that the plot in ""Atonement"" might have been ""enough"", if it had been done in another way. Something is lacking, but I cannot really put my finger on what it is. <br/><br/>But for one thing, it was very confusing that the scenes did not come in chronological order. There were too many flashbacks, and sometimes one got to see the same scene twice at various stages in the movie, but from different people's perspectives. Also, in the beginning of the movie I had difficulties keeping two - or even three - of the younger men apart, because the actors were too alike. That is very confusing indeed. And then in the end, the plot became even more confusing, when it turned out that some of the events had not happened at all, but were taken out of a novel about the whole thing... (???)"

Add in some confusing jumbling of the time sequence - presumably an attempt at 'originality' - and dreary, portentous music that a) drowns out dialogue, b) tries, but fails, to inject some emotion into the events being portrayed on the screen. Sprinkle with historical inaccuracies, a pretentious conclusion (are we supposed to buy the idea that the novelist can literally 'write off' his or her appalling actions by making up happy endings?) and clunking references to scenes far better done elsewhere (murky goings on in ponds - 'Don't Look Now'; beach warfare tableaux -'Saving Private Ryan'; in front of the black-and-white cinema screen -'Brief Encounter; etc)- and the result is a terrible mess! Joe Wright's acknowledged admiration of Celia Johnson and 'Brief Encounter' seems to have encouraged him to believe he can be the new David Lean. On this showing he isn't, no more than Ian McEwan is today's Noel Coward. Liked the colour photography though!"

","Atonement (2007) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play lovers who's lives are ruined when her younger sister sees them making love but not being able to understand what's going on, the girl tells a lie, which leads to the downfall of all three. I went into this film not knowing a single thing about the story so it took me quite a while to understand what was going on but from that point on the movie had me hooked unlike any love story in recent times. This is a very depressing and at times brutal story that unfolds in a very poetic way and in the end the film works wonders and contains some of the greatest moments I've seen in a movie in quite sometime. One of these scenes is an incredible beautiful shot set on a beach were thousands of soldiers are waiting to be picked up. I'm not sure how long this scene lasts but it plays out as if there are no edits and the epic scale of this scene is quite incredible. The other great scene is the sex/love scene that the little girl mistakes as something else. This is certainly one of the greatest love scenes I've witness from any movie as the true beauty of love comes pouring out in this scene making it very erotic, mystic and emotional. The performances are all wonderful and that includes Knightley who captures the mood and heartbreak of her character. McAvoy steals the film with his tremendous performance. The emotion he brings to the role is something truly great to watch. I think the film will work even better for me on a second viewing since it took me a while to figure out what was going on but leaving the theater I certainly felt as if I had seen something special."

OK lets start with the performances by the actors. Keria knightly's performance is OK, its not great, i think she performs better in the first half of the movie. She is not a great actor, i think she overacts and sometimes its not believable. James mcavoy does the most consistent acting and he has talent, especially in the scene were he confronts the girl who send him to war in which he breaks down.<br/><br/>I think the movie is very original in the first half of the movie, were there is like a flashback style which i really liked and also the background score was good with the typewriter music. The plot and story are good in the first half it goes at a nice pace and you get to know the characters. I kind of lost interest after the macvoy character is sent to war because it was very predictable in a sense that hes either gonna find his love or hes gonna die in war. It has been done better before and the keira knightly character was not really convincing.<br/><br/>All in all i though this movie was strong in the first half and did some original things good but then it lost it in the second half as if they lost the passion they had in the first half of the movie.

"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","4","7","16 January 2008"," ""Mr. Minghella, your time is over"" - Joe Wright.
","So it seems Anthony Minghella has a successor. Two years after his feature debut, a pleasant adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel ""Pride & Prejudice"", Joe Wright makes another good feature - ""Atonement"", a movie that shamelessly screams Oscar. Both Minghella and Wright have proved their undeniable visual talent and taste for megalomania. The biggest compliment I can give ""Atonement"" is that it's better than Minghella's ""The English Patient"", although it's been almost equally overrated.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but it's not particularly memorable. What really bothers me is the old formula that is so finely used here: a gorgeous-looking couple of protagonists (James McAvoy and pouting queen Keira Knightley), stunning cinematography (by Seamus McGarvey, ""The Hours""), classy music score (by Dario Marianelli), pretty costumes (by Jacqueline Durran), to tell a tragic story of love and war based, of course, on a best-seller (by Ian McEwan). The cast is precise: McAvoy, officially the ""new Jude Law"", gives a good performance, although not half as impressive as his turn opposite Forest Whitaker in ""The Last King of Scotland""; Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave are all good as the anti-heroine Briony Tallis, but no one really gives THAT performance. Keira doesn't ruin the movie because she didn't have much to do except looking pretty (which she's great at) and sad all the time, but she still needs some acting lessons - this girl is definitely one of the most overrated young actresses of our time.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, ""Atonement"" is a feast for the eyes, and has elements to please romantic audiences and critics alike. However, its emotional sterility shows that Wright can be Minghella's successor, but is still miles away from a master of beauty AND heart, like the great David Lean. 7/10."
"oneloveall","6","7","15","4 January 2008"," Noteworthy production definitely underachieves
","Certainly overrated as one of the highest reviewed films of the year, Atonement nonetheless provides viewers with the epic scope and cinematic grandeur that some of the best British period pieces have provided in the past. Cinematography, set design and direction seems to elevate this somewhat generic tale of ill-fated lovers into a stratosphere of high art-it is not.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film is being advertised inappropriately as an intense love story shared between two well known leads. Rather, Keira Knightley and James McAvoy's overworked chemistry take a back stage to a third party who, in fact revolves around the entire main story instead. Most romance between these two characters merely comes as an afterthought inside this troubled character's mind, leaving the movie with perhaps a bit more metaphysical appeal but taking away substantially from the emotional impact. The plot itself at times feels shamelessly light, often coming across like a classy soap opera instead of the powerful piece of fiction much hype has suggested.<br/><br/>Atonement is certainly worth the watch, if nothing more then for the scenery and a few exquisite shots (the beach war tracking shot in particular was stunning and one of the most impressive takes with massive amounts of extras seen recently)....Just try to enjoy the lightness of it all instead of ending up scratching your head wondering where all the bona-fide passion actually is."
"Bob-240","3","7","15","15 December 2007"," Deeply disappointing
","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie with as disappointing of an ending as this one. This movie does not deliver on the promises made in the advertisements. In fact, if you have seen the ads you already know everything in the movie. Just when it gets to the point where you expect the story to take off, it ends with a hollow thud. The makers of this movie either do not understand the meaning of the word ""atonement"" or they are purposely deceitful. The best things you can say about the movie are good acting and cinematography. The Dunkirk scene is amazing. However, in the end it is the story that is most important and it leaves you with a hollow feeling. Save yourself some disappointment and don't see it except on DVD."

","If you are looking for another review to tell you how Atonement is the best acted, best adapted, best costumed (and so on) movie of the year, please stop reading. I don't disagree with that. I simply feel duty-bound to tell you why it is still a bad movie.<br/><br/>Atonement is a period piece, set in 1935 and onwards. It follows the life of Briony Tallis (played by three actresses in the course of her life, including Vanessa Redgrave). We see how her error of judgement destroys the lives of at least two other people. She never does actually 'atone' for her wrong, although she ultimately finds a way of telling a second lie, more openly, to do the best she can in her own head. Excessively high production values, superlative acting, and a generally interesting story, blind to us the moral bankruptcy of our tale. A tale that has moral values as its focus. We come out of the cinema saying how interesting it was. But have accepted complicity in the same errors it purports to address.<br/><br/>Cecilia Tallis (Kiera Knightley) lives a life of wealth and privilege in her family's Gothic mansion. She is having a tempestuous affair with Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son. Cecilia's younger sister, Briony, is still a child. But Briony is at that cusp where hormones start to play havoc. She has been raised in a typical atmosphere of sexual hypocrisy. With an imagination informed more by her precocious skill as an author and playwright, than any understanding of humanity, she is only too ready to believe that most sex is evil. (Sex from a commoner is probably worse.) It is not long before some indiscretions on the part of Cecilia and Robbie allow Briony to form a wicked picture of the young man.<br/><br/>When Briony witnesses a genuinely horrific sexual act, she makes a false accusation against Robbie. The power structures of wealth and class soon close ranks with Briony. She spends the rest of her life not only screwed up by Victorian values, but by her own over-arching sense of guilt for what she has done. The real victim of the crime - and real perpetrator - are tidied up as mere plot loose ends.<br/><br/>I have not read the book and cannot comment on whether the original novel is as hypnotic, glossy - and essentially vacuous. But I am given to understand that Ian McEwan is happy with the screen version.<br/><br/>Like a modern Lady Macbeth (there is a rather overly obvious hand-scrubbing reference), Briony is unable to assuage her guilt. And like the very power-forces that gave her childish lie such strength, the wealth, skill and moral righteousness thrown into this movie con us into believing it is anything but superficial. The acting is faultless. I have been critical of Knightley in her Pride & Prejudice Oscar-nominated role, but here she does clipped, slightly stroppy Cecilia to perfection. Much of the lauded talent from that earlier film has been reassembled. And it is almost as if they are having another shot at the Oscars they narrowly missed before (acting, costume and art direction) and a few more. The middle section (focussing on Dunkirk) has many 'Oscar worthy' moments, such as when lovesick Robbie/McAvoy is silhouetted against a cinema screen kiss. Or the long panning shot of the desolate battlefield that mirrors his inner desolation. But they are done self-consciously: the screen silhouette, for instance, is repeated (in case we didn't get the significance the first time?) By the end of Act Two I was convinced that the filmmakers were not going to let a lack of anything constructive to say get in the way of a good Academy attempt. We are invited to marvel at the film's elegiac quality. Indeed, there is much to admire. But its self-conceit goes on for a rather long time. And at the end, blame has been placed in all the wrong places. It even hints that, as a last resort, stories are better than the truth."
"RKBlumenau","4","13","34","10 September 2007"," Over-hyped.
","With all its expensive production values, this film, like so many others, did not insist on clear diction, even in important scenes. Keira Knightley was a particularly bad offender; but there were many others.<br/><br/>The camera work was often arty but irritating and restless, and I am sorry to say that on the whole I thought it was a meretricious film. A blessed moment of clear diction and moving acting came nearly at the end, in the brief scene of Briony as an old woman (Vanessa Redgrave), and that was then promptly followed by the last few corny and sentimental shots on the sea shore."

I have seen Cleopatra, Showgirls, tons of Adam Sandler movies, and All About Steve which does come in a close second but with out doubt this is the worst movie of all time. It is pompous and awful. It is so bad that I don't know where to begin. There are so many people that herald this a good movie on IMDb, even the professional critics reviewed it positively. It was even nominated for an Oscar for best picture, ugh - just shows how irrelevant awards are. This is where great production and a grandiose story along with some misguided critics can lead to garbage being considered good and brainwashing viewers into agreeing - must conform. Basically, the movie has no plot which means there isn't a lot to discuss and also jumps through time awkwardly. Then when you learn what the main character did and how she tries to atone, it just feels false and falls flat considering what she initially did was quite unforgivable and still is. Then the end tries to be overly sentimental and instead is moronic. This movie is bad, bad, bad...."

","To put it bluntly, this film is a virulent mess. I mean, who would've thunk it? After Joe Wright's shimmering triumphs in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Charles II: The Power and the Passion""? And this cast? And this Ian McEwan storyline worthy of Graham Greene? And a Best Picture BAFTA? <br/><br/>It stinks, and here's how it apparently happened. Wright's florid cinematics worked well in his earlier two enterprises because of the strengths of the characters and the compelling story lines that held a great deal of interest via action and resulting character development. In this film, we find a context of greater introversion and subtlety, and the hope was that Wright would tone things down a little. Instead, he goes the opposite way, attempting to create a singular grafting of camera and musical themes (including typewriter key sounds) that defines rather than underpins the film.<br/><br/>Joe Wright is not Darren Aranovsky, however. And ultimately, the result is gratingly self-conscious and infuriatingly pretentious, consistently turning scenes into deflating ""look-at-this"" exercises. And if this isn't enough, Wright attempts to turn the story into an cinematic ""epic"", apparently wishing to rival ""The English Patient"" and ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" in scope and detail. McEwan's story doesn't lend itself well to this treatment, so the film collapses under massively detailed expositions of WWII and other events that contribute nothing to the story. The expositions themselves don't even ring true, and the plot's final twist almost seems anticlimactic under all of that weight.<br/><br/>Ultimately, my distaste for the enterprise led me into the fast-forward/laugh mode - fast-forwarding through the endless yawning pits of the superfluous landscape while laughing at the overall lost motivation of the film. I haven't done this with a major motion picture since ""Braveheart"", but with ""Braveheart"", I was laughing at the film's unintentionally hilarious content, not at its overall motivations. <br/><br/>2 Stars, and hopefully the nadir of a very talented director's career."

","This movie starts out with great promise, but is very disappointing. They seem to have put a lot of effort into setting up the story and the beginning draws you in. But some of the scenes in the middle are needlessly long and drawn out and do nothing to contribute to the telling of the story. Then suddenly realize that they have to end the thing because it is getting too long and quickly jump to an ending that is completely disjointed from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>If you must see it, wait for the DVD.

","Although not an entirely awful film, it was not the masterpiece people I know attested to it being. There are some picturesque scenes scattered here and there, however overall the pace of the film in anything but even. The first 40 min feel like nothing has happened. It's the build up to the act that defines the rest of the film, but did it necessarily need 40 min? Briony (Ronan) decides to accuse the wrong man of a heinous crime. Why? Because she is infuriated by the fact he doesn't reciprocate the affection she has towards him? Yeah, I think that's it.... Of course no one thinks to question the words of this privileged, assuming 13 year old. The next 40min are dedicated to the lovers of the film. I say ""lovers""; in fact they are separated due to the war and hardly ever meet up during this time span. Cecilia (Knightley) is the rich, spoiled and hardly likable young lady who has gone out of her way to shun the servant's son Robbie (McAvoy) until the fateful night of the crime. A sequence of event leads them to admit their feelings for one another, and a passionate moment between them ensues. A few hours later, Robbie is arrested. Cecilia leaves behind her family and their riches as a form of protest to the injustice done and in declaration of her undying love for Robb... hang on, what? Really? In the last part of the film Briony (Garai), reappears. 4-5 years older and (supposed) wiser, she is now punishing herself for her previous sin by refusing to go to Cambridge and becoming a nurse instead. It's a hard-knock life, scrubbing dirty bedpans and taking orders from the strict Orderly. I mean, oh how the mighty have fallen. Am I supposed to feel sorry for her? The thing is, I don't. Overly sentimental, it was hard to feel for anyone except, maybe, the victim Robbie. There is a sense of helplessness that lingers throughout the whole film. Knightley expands on her typical brand of ""acting""; in this film she no longer limits herself to just eyebrow dances and outward jaw thrusts. She now includes a staccato-type speech pattern, to synchronize, I guess, with that annoying, perpetual typewriter sound heard throughout the whole film. Garai is just ""meh"" is her performance. McAvoy and Ronan, however, shine. The story ends with a statement from an older Briony (played by Vanessa Redgrave), relating to her ""atonement"", the pomposity of which left me flabbergasted. In summary, I could not feel for almost any of the characters in the film and as such I spent most of the time looking at my wrist watch, waiting for it to be over."

","Plot:<br/><br/>1935, and 13 year-old Briony (Ronan) changes the course of several lives when she misreads the relationship between her sister Cecilia (Knightley) and housekeeper's son Robbie (McAvoy). Later, as World War II rages, she tries to atone for her mistake. <br/><br/>My Review: <br/><br/>This is Briony (Saoirse Ronan), forged by her family and aspiring to be an accomplished writer and playwright and pedantic know-it-all; who uses that same enthusiasm to run riot with her advocated mind full of plethora's that seem to lie down like a silver-platter full of misconstrued actions.<br/><br/>Her lucid creativity and lack of self-awareness; all too common with some kids these days, as she verges on the precipice of all too well known adolescence, adding a twisted sense of her judgement, in effect creating a series of shocking revelations.<br/><br/>Romola Garai plays the elder counterpart of Briony gets the more difficult less pungent role, a character that lives an almost entirely introvert life. Some screen mannerisms shows this gamut, she's overshadowed by Saoirse Ronan as her 13 year-old self, who seems more aware of herself and her surroundings.<br/><br/>Her sister on the other hand, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), with her sharp tones are exactly posh enough to fit Cecilia; lounges by the pool smoking with Brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) all the while keeping her distance from nonentity Robbie (James McAvoy), a scholarship boy with little to recommend him than himself. The elder cast actors barely get a look in or even a second look - near-cameos from Brenda Blethyn, and Vanessa Redgrave aside, the three are in the centre stage. McAvoy astoundingly impresses, while Knightley who finally stakes her claim in a grown-up part and does more without a pirate's rusty blade. <br/><br/>Fantasy refined with a pragmatist sense of underwater scenes make the stately home feel like a home, heat, tension, sexual and or otherwise, cracking from under the marble floors. All leading to an erotic sex scene audiences' will not expect, but be stunned despite the fact that both parties remain almost fully dressed. All seems too well; time seems to be against them.<br/><br/>1940, as World War II rages around them, we see the central three characters - Cecilia, Robbie and Briony (now played by Romola Garai) a few years later. Cecilia and Briony are working as nurses in London, Briony giving the indication of following her sisters' footsteps to atone, while Robbie is part of the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, trying desperately to reach the boat for home at Dunkirk in the last and darkest days of Britain's war effort. Innocence of youth has faded to something chilling, a world that's covered in veils and old faded photographs with impiety and an ever-present paucity of light. The second act sees Briony turn from self-righteous to stricken in the turn of a page. We have the chance to wallow in the mess she has left, and realise the full extent of the crime for which she must atone.<br/><br/>Some very neat and summer-tinged French countryside through which Robbie and his comrades tramp is already war-weary, provides some beautiful and some brutal detours that make the surroundings more of a shock than welcoming. Some have and have not seen clips and small sneak peeks about what's going to make Wright's reputation. In a gob-smacking (literally) five-minute tracking shot on the beach at Dunkirk, as Robbie's exhausted troopers stagger in to find not refuge but chaos. To incessantly babble of it would not give its full constructive meaning. This is as effective a World War II beach scene matching to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan's opening.<br/><br/>The quality of the production as a whole removes any indication in flaws in the narrative; which are almost immediately overshadowed by the next esteemed scene. When on some level you are left with a crescendo volleyed ending, you are left reeling and wanting more. The end plays as a shock, is there ever a happy ending? <br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Delicately handled, goes from pure heavenly fantasy to brutal war-time drama. Well contrasted with gorgeous cinematography, a picturesque score and unquestionable performances. 8/10."

This is a movie that simply...does not satisfy...one feels one has ate a huge meal..yet still feels empty. The two leads James McAvoy and Keira Knightly are very good. The direction is also well above average. It is one of those annoying ""stiff upper lip"" British flicks that doesn't cut the mustard. (Whats that old boy ??..!!) Yes OK life is full of personal tragedies, but the complexity of the mistake that a 13 year old child makes (in extreme circumstances) is sad...sure, but not a sin. Somehow it is she who i feel sorry for. She was a girl becoming sexually aware, who also had a crush on her big sisters lover. What she did had huge ramifications ...but i don't see how a girl of her age (in a 1935 English country setting) could know anything about adult emotions. And that is the problem...in the book it is all made very clear. Some novels should NOT be made into movies....this is one."

","NOTE: I am not being a troll, and bashing the movie. I am simply showing that I did not like the film, and would like to hear your opinions (not arguments, please). This is a review I had to write for a school paper, and I would welcome criticism on how it is written- not on my opinions. <br/><br/>Here Goes: <br/><br/>After all the hype about Joe Wright's recently released ""Atonement,"" new audiences undoubtedly suspect to see something amazing and forever life changing- a new epic that rewrites all the rules and yet falls into place with many of the old classic love stories. However, this movie is devastatingly disappointing- Kiera Knightly (Celia Tallis) and James McAvoy (Robbie Turner) star with a cast of nameless actors to create a poor representation of a classic British romance novel by Ian McEwan. <br/><br/>The movie starts in England, right before the outbreak of World War two. Soon-to-be lovers Cecilia Tallis and Robbie Turner are both back for the summer from Cambridge, and a family (a mother and three children- Perriot, Jackson, and Lola) are staying with the Tallis family while they undergo a divorce. Through a chain of unnecessarily complicated occurrences and events (all rooted in the foolishness and lies of Briney, Celia's 13-year-old sister), Robbie is wrongfully accused and convicted of Lola's rape, and the pair of lovers are separated. The plot drags on and on from there, involving excessive and long scenes that do nothing to further the audience's perception of the era or conflict.<br/><br/>To further the disappointment, the story line is butchered by a series of flashbacks and divisions used to explain the misconceptions behind opposing points of view, and makes grasping the reality nearly impossible for the average movie-goer. Although the acting was average, Knightly disappointed audiences with a lack of enthusiasm and failed to fit the role. In addition, the screenplay was very poor, and the actors talked incredibly too fast while failing to enunciate or put emphasis on any conversation. <br/><br/>The only refreshing part of the film is the fact that it differs from the average 'chick-flick' in that it does not have a 'fairy-tale ending.' The interestingly twisted plot and surprise ending do well to redeem the film, but also serves as a let down for a hopeful audience. In fact, if you manage to follow the situational maze of the film, you might actually enjoy the work. However, if you are an average person that does not want to feel like jumping off of a bridge at the end of a movie, I would strongly advise you against watching the fiasco."

Other than the character of Robbie, the characters were bored, boring, self-absorbed rich people, and I couldn't care less about any of them. The relationship between Cecelia and Robbie can hardly be described as a love story, let alone a great one. Poor Robbie to have fallen in love (or is that lust) with such a spoiled and vain girl. Her treatment of him is crass. She plays with his affections, then ignores him at university, makes it clear that he is beneath her, and then engages in a moment of passionate and lust in the library. This is not love. It is not even a good imitation of love.<br/><br/>The only compliment I can give to this film is the cinematography. The acting was fine, but not stupendous. And for God's sake, someone feed Keira Knightly. She is a poster child for anorexia."

Movies that touch you in some way, and in the end makes you wonder about what really happened in the movie. This movie will definitely make you wonder. Not what happened, but why you spent that much time watching it.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays her role as good as it can be played. Enough said. Rest of the acting is pretty good as well, but that simply is not enough to carry a movie. The plot simply isn't there. It's basically about a girl who tells a lie and puts her sister's boyfriend to prison. We see incoherent scenes from his years in prison, and then later on we follow him at war. Then he meets his old girl (knightley) again, and they get together. That's mainly the plot in this movie. There's nothing epic, nothing new in this movie.<br/><br/>The only reason I could think of makes people think is that it constantly jumps in time. It sees everything from two angles, which is pretty annoying if you ask me. First we see something through the eyes of one person, then the exact same scene through another person's eyes.

","""Atonement"" is an intelligent, scrupulously crafted film boasting lovely images and high production values. It is also cold, antiseptic, and artificial. <br/><br/>""Atonement""'s best feature is the chemistry between the aristocratic Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and her family's servant, Robbie (James McAvoy). McAvoy, especially, is a revelation. One hopes that he will be handed many more roles, and soon, in which he can do what he did here: play a dreamy-eyed, innocent and young, slave to passion.<br/><br/>WARNING: THIS REVIEW WILL REVEAL THE ""SURPRISE"" ENDING OF ""ATONEMENT."" If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this review.<br/><br/>""Atonement""'s opening scenes telegraph that its major focus is not love or even human beings; rather, ""Atonement""'s focus is the problems facing writers. ""Atonement"" is an intellectual exercise, an essay on the writer's life, and the role of fiction.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" opens with a shot of an English manor house. But, wait  it's not a manor house at all, but a doll house replica, in the bedroom of Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year-old upper class English girl and playwright. And, so, the frame, the point of view, and the theme of the movie is set. This won't be a story about its ostensible main characters  the lovers Cecilia and Robbie, at all  rather it is a story focused on Briony telling a story that suits her needs and desires.<br/><br/>Symbolism is portentous and beats the viewer on the head  almost literally. Since the movie is all about the job of the fiction writer, the sound of typewriter keys striking paper, a ball striking a wall, heels clicking down a hallway, all segue into the soundtrack's savage drumbeat percussion. There is plenty of water symbolism, including Briony  pronounced ""briney""'s  name. Also much is made of light. The opening daytime scenes, at the English manor house, are overexposed. Briony is lead to a fateful encounter thanks to a shiny pin. A desk lamp blinds her and distorts what she sees. With all this light and water, you may want to bring your sunscreen.<br/><br/>Briony is that most clichéd of characters  a straight-laced English female who superficially recoils from sex but secretly burns with passion and jealousy. Her self-control is stereotypically destructive. Briony's bedroom walls are covered with wallpaper depicting pullulating foliage. A bee, symbol of something sweet  honey  dangerous, and female  beats, loudly, percussively, against Briony's bedroom window. One thinks of ""High Wind to Jamaica"" and other English works in which a cosseted English girl wreaks havoc once her inner savage is let out.<br/><br/>Briony believes that Robbie is guilty of assaulting a child, Lola. Lola was assaulted, but she and Briony accuse the wrong man. In short, females are guilty when men violate them. On Briony's word alone, Robbie is parted from his love, Cecilia, and sent to prison. This is not presented convincingly. Robbie had an alibi  he had been rescuing two lost boys, as the boys can attest. Too, he is his master's prize; though the son of a scullery maid, his master is sending him to medical school. And, Cecilia loves him. Why the courts would take the word of a 13-year-old known fabulist against that of her better educated and older sister is never made clear.<br/><br/>A good movie could have explored how the courts were weighted against a working class man accused of assault, and on Cecilia's sticking by her working class lover in spite of everything, but ""Atonement"" simply cheats; it skips the work of its own plot, and jumps to the 1940 English retreat from the Nazis at Dunkirk. Exposition informs us that Robbie had gotten out of prison by joining the army. Film fans have made much of the five-and-a-half minute long, single-take tracking shot of the chaotic scene on the beach, with English forces shooting their horses and destroying equipment in order that they might not fall into Nazi hands.<br/><br/>While watching this scene, I thought to myself, ""Well, we've just left the movie."" Nothing in this Dunkirk tracking shot does anything to advance previous narrative or themes. It's as if the author ran out of ideas and said, ""Hey, wasn't there a very cinematic war going on nearby at this very time? Let's nip over to France for a while and exploit the wartime scenery."" Robbie dies of war wounds while waiting to be evacuated from Dunkirk. Cecilia dies when a tube station is flooded (more water symbolism).<br/><br/>Years later, Briony, now Vanessa Redgrave (would that we all morphed into Vanessa Redgrave as we aged) is a famous novelist and is telling the story on a TV talk show. With one change  in her fictionalized memoir of the events, Briony has provided a happy ending. She allows her characters, Robbie and Cecilia, to survive the war, and to retire to a lovely, sunny beach house (more light and water) where they spend their days gazing into each other's eyes and smooching. Briony, you see, has been eaten up with guilt for having accused Robbie of a crime he did not commit. To make up for that, to ""atone"" for ruining her sister and her sister's lover's lives, Briony writes a happy novel based on their experiences.<br/><br/>Which is all very clever. And, as evidenced by reviews here, for many viewers, it's very moving. I felt this movie's intellectual, manipulative hand against my chest  in the heavy handed symbolism, in the clichéd plot devices, and in the underdeveloped characters. The viewer learns nothing about Cecilia or Robbie, except that they are both young and good looking and hot for each other, and that they speak with those posh British accents we've come to associate with quality entertainment.<br/><br/>But his must be said again  James McAvoy is brilliant, and should be working, right now, on more and better films."

","This movie, although many will go against this declaration, is not for every type of viewer. Those who enjoy ampulous movies, watching the production details, or gasping against fabulous skies and fields for minutes, and enjoy a lenghty, slowly told story; will like it. Those (most likely men) who enjoy another type of movies; fast movies, with fulfilling characters, twists and sudden changes, will be disappointed by Atonement.<br/><br/>My partial disliking of the film, however, comes through another lane. The story, and semi-spoiler ahead, centers mainly and poses the eye on the couple of Robbie (McAvoy) and Cecilia (Knieghtly) and it's relationship. Yet their relationship is nothing more than a sexual attraction arising from years of close living together. Their is no inner travels to their feelings, but to their thoughts. It's a cold relationship, moved by some impacts and problems that do not really satisfy the romantic crave.<br/><br/>Later we realize the focus and most compromising story gathers around Briony (a beautiful and genius Saoirse Ronan) and her story of Atonement through a mistake she did. We will appreciate the closing, her development, and she will be the most endurable character.<br/><br/>Then why did the story hesitated in showing random scenes of Robbie at war, showing the despair of War that nothing has to do with the spine of the movie. The story of Lola doesn't bring much to the story, but a device to fuel the conflicts.

","This movie is nominated for so many awards mostly because it's a drama and that's what always gets nominated. It's not that great. If you have seen the trailer you've seen everything, there is nothing new in between. All the romance and all the war we expect from it is minimal. I don't mind how a movie ends, it can be happy or tragic or inconclusive as long as the middle section is good, but this movie you wait and wait for it to kick off and it never happens, its long, it drags, and it's a bit boring. I didn't get goosebumps from the romance (you know that sigh feeling you get like when watching the Notebook) and i didn't clench my butt cheeks from suspense during his time in war as there is none (the preview really over blew that part). Like i said, if you've seen the trailer, watch it twice and there's the whole movie. Not worth the 10 bucks. just rent it. PS: just because a movie has great actors doesn't mean it's going to be good. by the way Robbie the main character is more than a good actor, hes great! they could've used his talent so much more, so much potential there, what a waste."
"casey-99","6","5","11","2 January 2008"," Lovely to Look at
","I have mixed feeling about this movie. I tend to be a sentimental person so I enjoyed the love story very much. My husband (the logical one) did not. We both agreed that character development was a bit vague and there were a variety of story lines that never really seemed wrapped up. Joe Wright is brilliant, but he does not yet know how to tell a story clearly. He uses every trick in the movie directors book to dazzle just for the sake of it. Instead, it would be interesting to see him use his talent to really drive the story forward. I did have moments where I felt the director was saying ""Look at this gorgeous scene, aren't I brilliant!"". Yes, the 5 minute Dunkirk span is unbelievable, but why is it being done. Wright does it because he can. Branagh used this technique to show the actual battlefield sorrow and destruction in Henry V, thus he uses it with purpose. Anyhow, I digress. I give Mr. Wright huge credit for the performances he gets out of his actors. Keira Knightly has real acting chops and James MacAvoy keeps his momentum from Last King of Scotland going. Their scenes together are very strong and carry real tension. Ronan is very good as young Briony, but the real unsung hero of this film is Romola Garai who approaches a difficult portion of the material with real panache and emotion. She is a joy to watch. Even the supporting roles jump out at you. Of course Vanessa Redgrave takes a small part and makes it immensely emotional and powerful. I would see the movie just for the performances. All in all, it is worth seeing."
"ambimom","5","5","11","29 December 2007"," Great novel -- lackluster film
","I saw this movie about 24 hours after I finished reading the novel. To paraphrase someone else's metaphor, to compare the novel to this movie is like comparing a swiss army knife to a spork. The parts are all there, but somehow it never comes together. Much of the enjoyment derived from Ian McEwan's novel comes from his masterful and poetic use of the English language. Though his words are used in the movie dialog, the internal musings are absent. For instance, the scene in which Harriet Walters is shown languishing in her bedroom with a sleeping mask covering her eyes seems out of place unless you know that in the novel Mrs. Tallis suffers greatly from migraine. So much so in fact that she has ceded the running of the household to Cecilia. A third of the novel is devoted to Robbie's war experience and the retreat of troops to Dunkirk. It was hard to read because of the horrors depicted. The movie unfortunately reduces the utter senseless stupidity and violence of war to a series of expensive tracking shots. As for the cast, I think they were fine. James McAvoy and Keira Knightly fit their roles, but the movie never explains things that would have put their love story in believable context. The love story seems bizarre unless you understand that these two characters had been close childhood friends. They both attended Cambridge -- paid by her father and while there, grew apart. He graduated with distinction, she barely passed. Now that they've graduated, her father has agreed to pay for his medical studies. Mrs. Tallis does not share her husband's sentiments. She doesn't think it is a good idea, remarking prophetically,""Nothing good will come of it."" Cecilia seems to share her mother's beliefs because she snubbed him socially while they were at university together. It's a shame really because all the elements are there; it's just they sort of hang."

","there are many problems with this movie for me to recommend it. all i can say is it has a good intention to be a good movie but sometimes that's just not enough. it's almost trying too hard to be something but the director couldn't make his mind between making a stylish film or telling a compelling story and it turned out neither stylish nor compelling. it didn't engage me emotionally till the last 20 minutes but it was a little too late. the middle part of movie is BORING and it drags. the war segment probably the most expensive to produce but has the least to say about anything other than 'how awful the war is' cliché. there are a lot of time line jump around but it adds more confusion than suspension. the story is not that complicated and the jump around is unnecessary. Knightley's one dimension acting ability is getting tiresome to watch since her promising pride and prejudice. even the somewhat clever soundtrack (by incorporating the sound in the story line) is too obvious and showy. if this movie were up for Oscar race, 2007 would be a very poor year."
"Afzal-s2007","Null","5","11","3 October 2007"," A Disappointing And Dispiriting Adaptation, Only Worthwhile As A Brit Calling Card to Hollywood And Oscar
","Atonement seems more natural a subject for a novel, rather than a film, as it concerns writing and its momentous consequences, be it a note, a letter or a novel. Moreover, Atonement has a writer at its centre, and is therefore at an even greater disadvantage for film-making, as the craft of writing is laborious and involves little physical action. It is essentially a solitary, even obsessive, occupation, and so doesn't lend itself to the active demands of a film. But it may be argued that a clever, imaginative film would find some way round this. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Atonement is not a clever film. Instead, its makers seem to have been rather complacent and smugly thought that the film would sell on the back of the alluring parts of the novel, in other words a lavish country house in high summer where there is upstairs-downstairs class antagonism and illicit sex scandals, and later a shift to a harsh wartime romance. The filmmakers seem to have thought that this would suffice. However, stretched over two hours, the film seems rather thin, even threadbare. <br/><br/>The characters in the novel have unusual depth and subtlety. While this has been retained, to an extent, in this adaptation, on screen they seem unreal, lifeless. And with the exception of the three excellent actresses who play Briony at different ages, the (no more than) competent acting complements the competent, but still lacking, characterisation. <br/><br/>Christopher Hampton, who usually engages as a writer and director, has written a disappointing script which loses the charged, sweltering promise of its first act (which would actually have made a much better short film) and gives way to a staid middle act which relies on wartime sentimentality and tries far too hard to elicit pathos in the viewer.<br/><br/>Joe Wright seems content to direct Atonement as a calling card to Hollywood and Oscar, his highpoint being the long scene showing the Dunkirk evacuation, which is technically accomplished and stunning, but also wearying and approaching banality as this kind of thing has been done as well so many times before. The film's denouement seems tacked on to provide a smart-looking, post modern ending.<br/><br/>Atonement is a disappointing and dispiriting adaptation of a clever, intriguing novel."
"Det_McNulty","7","5","11","8 September 2007"," A Rare Cinematic Showcase, Offering A Vast Array Of Engaging Talent
","2007 has been a slow year up until now; at least, I have been unimpressed by practically every release of the year so far. Hence, my uncertainty of whether I should let my expectations rise for the opening of Atonement. Instead, I decided to go in without listening to the hype. I came out of the cinema exhausted, yet it was a good kind of exhaustion, the kind of exhaustion found after an emotionally draining experience which actually succeeded in moving the viewer. Atonement has Best Picture material written all over it, and at this current stage I sincerely doubt that I will find any 2007 film to surpass it.<br/><br/>Adapted from the novel of war veteran Ian McEwan, Atonement is directed by young British talent, Joe Wright. Weaving a convoluted, sometimes fascinatingly dreamlike story of unforgiving love in WW2 Britain, Atonement centres on a rich family torn apart by a terrible crime and a love that could never be. Centring itself on three key characters; the young Briony Tallis (played by Saoirse Ronan), her elder sister, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and their housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), from here on the film depicts the misinterpreted relationship drawn between Cecilia and Robbie. The film conducts a web of disillusionment and regret.<br/><br/>For me, the finest element of Atonement is the editing, which is some of the most subtly detailed of recent years. It is the type of fresh editing which enables the viewer to realise how even more alluringly intelligent the picture is. For example, the moment where it cuts from Keira Knightley diving, to James McAvoy bringing himself up from under the bathwater. There are numerous other moments to name, such as the ""cigarettes and opera"" sequence or the lavishly romantic sex scene. Everything fits together with a non-superficial ease, providing a sense of far more thoughtful film-making. Having the pressing typewriter beats playing against a person's hurried walk is another notable case of sound editing; it should be noted because it helps the atmosphere have an additional level of unavoidable allure. You just cannot refuse to ignore the adaptable use of stylistically-enhancing editing. Cinematography also plays a huge part in the picture, too. Rather than simply relying on a clean-cut narrative and some noteworthy performance, the film makes an effort to employ all the features which start to create real cinema. The five-minute long tracking-shot found when the troops enter Dunkirk left me in awe, conveying the destruction through its confrontational set-pieces.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the acting is yet another one of the film's triumphant endeavours. Being that the director's vision and the actor's insights are fused together with an undeniable awareness, meaning the film is at liberty to take a consistently smooth pace. The camera seems to pick up every detail the performers exert, e.g. the recurring use of hand/eye gestures to echo the feelings found within awkward or crucial moments. Evidently, a lot of time was spent rehearsing the magnificent screenplay, since all the actors deliver their lines with a secured knowledge, but without the viewer feeling as though anything was overly rehearsed. Even Keria Knightley left me stupefied, considering I have become exempt to seeing her provide wooden performances which offer nothing what-so-ever for a film. Yet, she is quite sublime in Atonement, exemplifying the features of an upperclass woman. Proving that she can tackle mature roles meant I felt pleased to see a genuinely positive performance from the ever-growing star. James McVoy is by far the film's overall star, though.<br/><br/>Not only is Atonement a romance, it is a war film and drama, too. I admit that I expected the film to be the generic sentimental tweaking on a period-piece/costume-drama premise. To my great surprise I was blown away, stunned by the dynamic personalities which were being portrayed on-screen and left in a daze over the luscious visuals. Essentially, Atonement is a romance, and I would be ignorant to deny it. Nonetheless, I found it to be much more than a ""romance"", but in fact a lyrical journey of culpability."

(R)<br/><br/>Respectable adaptation of Ian McEwan's same-named novel (by Christopher Hampton) set in England during the interwar period, depicting the consequences of a lie told by 13-year-old Briony (Ronan) that brings ruin to her sister (Knightley) and the young housekeeper she loves, Robbie (McAvoy). Although the foundation of the plot device that creates the evidentiary misunderstanding is straight out of a clumsy farce, the scenes set at the Tallis country estate are far and away the most involving (due in large part to Ronan's poised presence, as well as the promise of tension and scandal). Once the story moves ahead a few years to the Second World War, the storytelling becomes disjointed and Wright's decorous instincts are vanquished by preening showmanship, exemplified by the Dunkirk beach scene, a complicated and technically impressive long shot that exists as a grandiose monument to itself without the rationality or resonance it needs to really work. At one point, Robbie instructs Briony to provide ""just the truth...no embellishments""; pity the filmmakers didn't follow suit. Despite falling far short of greatness, the movie is too ably performed, richly photogenic, and aurally scintillating to dismiss--the implementation of clacking typewriter keys in Dario Marianelli's Oscar-winning score is one of the few bold experiments that succeeds.<br/><br/>63/100"
"divadrummer","8","2","3","20 January 2008"," An overblown rose
","War-torn romance is almost its own subgenre of drama. Though we feel we've seen it all, Atonement still has some fresh ideas to deliver. The film is a bouquet of imagery, and gathers three interesting stories into something of a twisted love triangle. Atonement's narrative may be too familiar, and often rushes past the point of empathy, but the movie is so beautiful that we can forgive some of these faults.<br/><br/>Briony (Saoirse Ronan) is a serious storyteller on the cusp of ladyhood. She lives with her uninhibited older sister Cecilia (Knightley) on a large estate in the English country. Cecilia is in academic competition with a servant's son, Robbie (McAvoy), as both are attending medical school with support from Cecilia's father. Briony's imagination runs wild when she thinks she sees Robbie commit a horrible crime. Her testimony condemns Robbie to prison, and leads to his involvement in WWII.<br/><br/>Atonement is most interesting when Briony's story is explored. She's a very smart girl, but not altogether perfect - a little too prim and prone to jealousy. But Briony is also fiercely loyal and protective of her friends. We can't completely love her, but we admire her complexity. Hers is a story of the confusion and dark dawn of adolescence, and her actions drive the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Cecilia is something of a rebel - proud and sharp-tongued. I'm not a Kiera fan, but I enjoy her feisty, nonchalant performance through most of the movie. Robbie is cocky but highly sentimental. They're practically made for each other, and as you can guess from the posters, they fall in love before Robbie is sent to jail and war. This is where the movie starts to lose us.<br/><br/>When the lovers are apart, we experience their generalized pain and longing, but it all feels like an outline instead of a heart-felt exploration. So much attention is given to the images of war and suffering, the costumes and despairing gazes, that we can't fully sympathize. This is complicated by how quickly their relationship develops, only to be torn and kept separate through most of the movie. We can't reminisce and sigh about the times they had together - there weren't many. We don't feel what they're going through, because it's mostly done in silence against highly glorified images of war. Their actions aren't especially telling. The misty looks to the horizon speak for themselves, but say little more than ""this sucks, I want to go home."" There are several parts of this film that lead me to believe that it's severely abridged from the novel. The secondary characters are nearly perfunctory, and one even pops on screen for a meaningful conversation with seemingly no context. Briony and Cecilia's parents are mostly absent. The lovers meet during the war, but how they found each other or why they're separated again isn't entirely clear. Five important years of Briony's life vanish. We don't have much trouble connecting the past to the present, but it's nowhere near as developed as it should be.<br/><br/>However, the art of the film is very well established. All of the pre-war scenes glow white and are rich with pastels and florals. Briony always appears in white and is backlit through the movie for an ethereal innocence. The shots are all highly composed and symmetrical, with careful attention to the beautiful architecture and room design. When passion is introduced, twilight falls, colors become richer and deeper, and images are blurred. Montage is so prevalent, it's almost overused. There's a tracking shot of Robbie on the French beach with thousands of English soldiers waiting for boats to retreat home - the chaos and comedy of war is explored in this lengthly, dense footage bathed in brown and gold. Beyond the costumes and colors, the sound plays a pleasantly important part in the film. Briony's scenes are accompanied by the calculated clacks of percussion and typewriters. Scenes across oceans are connected by a thread of melody. Montage music dissolves into sounds of the next scene. These techniques may be considered too overt, but the were a joy for me.<br/><br/>Atonement has its flaws, and I can see why some would spurn it completely. There are romantic clichés. There is not enough time given to building the romance. The ending is completely unsatisfying and gimmicky. But we're so cynical and well-versed as an audience that it's difficult to please, and nearly impossible to show us anything new without us assuming it's a trick to gain our favor. The primary focus of the film seems to be the art - I'm happy enough to hear a story that doesn't overshadow or detract from that stunning cinema."

Watching this move I was mesmerized by its beauty and captivated by the performances of the cast. James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, and Saoirse Ronan deserve every accolade. If this film has one weakness, it is in its pacing. Though it pains me to admit, it does drag in parts. If you are looking for a dramatic/action war film, this is not it. However, if you are looking for something that really does explore the human condition with all its strengths and flaws, then I cannot recommend a better film."
"wassduo","8","2","3","17 January 2008"," Great - Many Will Love It But I Never Will
","This was a well-wrought film. The actors, pacing, and dialog all worked to create believable and engrossing relationships and interpersonal dynamics. In relative terms, the film is faithful to the book.<br/><br/>** Warning Spoiler Coming ** I have two gripes. One is with the logic of the movie and the other is with its central point.<br/><br/>My first problem is the reasoning of the police and relatives that a man could rape a girl and then set out and find the two boys and hike back. There's absolutely no thought given to the fact that the protagonist is last seen marching off into the dark with a flashlight to find the two missing boys, Briony heads out in a different direction, stumbles upon what she thinks is a rape scene (with the protagonist walking away), and yet, somehow, the protagonist goes off to find the missing boys. The movie glosses right over this incongruity. Yet, I think in any court that was at all honest and mindful of the facts, a reconstruction of the time line would have called into question the protagonist's ability to have even been around to commit the crime he was accused of.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is that the title is unexpectedly ironic. There is very little atonement in the film. Sure, Briony becomes a nurse and tends to the wounded. But, the action she had to atone for didn't involve hospitals it involved stealing the chance of love away from her sister and she and her sister's mutual heart-throb. We, the audience, are supposed to just accept that by being a nurse and by writing a happy ending, Briony has made up for her sins. Maybe I am just too much of an old testament type, but she sent a man to jail and denied love between two people at a time - WWII - when there was little joy or hope to be had. Dunkirk was one of England's darkest hours. To atone for what she did, she need to make up for her specific misdeeds. If I mistakenly break my mother's favorite lamp, I buy her a new lamp and tell her I am sorry. I don't wait a decade and write an email admitting my sin then send it out on a listserv.<br/><br/>It was utterly unsatisfactory to have Briony say she gave them the happy ending in her novel that she denied them in life. She waited until she was on her deathbed to admit openly that she had erred. How incredibly cowardly; ""Well, now that the truth cannot harm me, I will come forward."" What balderdash. I love words. I am using them now, but I do not believe they can ever supplant our actions in their import.<br/><br/>Rarely has a movie ending filled me with such revulsion. How utterly remorseless of the filmmakers, to create a train crash and shine a light on it until the bitter end. What are we to learn from this? I certainly found nothing redeeming in Briony. She needed to go tell the authorities of her mistake, she needed to own up to what she did. Instead, we are supposed to accept that the few pages of fantasy in a book she wrote literally decades after the death of the affected parties is somehow a form of atonement. If it is, it is in gesture only. It is a one-calorie soda when you really need an energy drink.<br/><br/>I left depressed and unsatisfied. I could take no solace from the ending and it bothers me that this is so well liked. I appreciated the reviewer who said the power of the story is that it shows the power of words to hurt and their power to heal. But, while that sounds nice, that is not borne out. I would buy it if Briony had spoken truthfully to those in power. I would have even been okay if she fessed up and the authorities turned her away. But to do nothing is just contemptible. And, to me, her nursing of others almost smacks of conceit and condescension. It is a way for Briony to feel better about herself without ever having to do the really difficult part, which is to go to her parents and the police and admit her mistake.<br/><br/>The best things I learned from this movie were: 1) I am that most derided of film-goers, the one who always wants a happy ending, 2) never again let my wife pick the movie (at least without checking moviespoiler.com to see if I'll like it), and 3) I genuinely hate tragedies, which I have known since I read Macbeth in high school."

","I read Ian McEwan's Atonement novel a little over a year ago for class (it's not the type of book I'd read for myself). Naturally, I decided it would be interesting to see the critically acclaimed film adaptation. Atonement follows the novel faithfully, with the exception of a couple scenes. It tells the story of a imaginative child, Briony Tallis, who discovers a love relationship between her sister Cecilia and friend Robbie. She mistakes Robbie for a sexual maniac, and wrongly accuses him when another friend, Lola, is attacked in the night. The rest of the plot follows the consequences of this accusation and Briony's attempts at atonement.<br/><br/>The film is Oscar quality in many ways. The direction is excellent; the complex plot is difficult to clearly convey on screen, but Joe Wright is able to put it together with few flaws. In the first half hour or so, the pacing is a bit jumbled; this clears up as it develops. The camera-work is well done; a notable scene is the five minute single-shot recreation of the Dunkirk beaches. The acting is good from all parts and the character development is solid. The music score was also excellent; it really fit the mood of the whole movie and added a nice touch to the key scenes.<br/><br/>Atonement is an emotional film. It carries a sense of sadness that few films are capable of. The remarkable thing is that the sadness is not at all depressing, but more sympathetic. It is sad to realize the extent of such a small moment and how it could tear lives apart. That is the main thing that makes Atonement a film that I would highly recommend."
"johnnyboyz","8","2","3","11 January 2008"," A Contemporary twist film that uses romance as its drive before hitting us with the tragedy.
","Such a film like Atonement is one that sneaks up on you; it builds and builds seemingly going nowhere or not doing anything to suggest anything fantastic before hitting you with a contemporary twist. It's a film that makes you think; thus already elevating itself above a certain level of quality, there have been films that have used this little tactic in recent years that have spawned both great hate and admiration; films like: The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and even The Village. The films hit you with a series of scenes that although seem disjointed and random, all make sense when the apparent 'twist' makes itself known.<br/><br/>After the film had ended; it got me thinking, which is a good sign. 'What does Atonement actually mean?' I thought to myself and that's when the penny dropped. Such audacity to have a major clue in the films title hinting at the possible results that will happen following the events that occur in the film's first plot point. If that sounds complicated then good, because clever films are complicated. Following Atonement's finale, I think two thirds of what I was going to say about the film were rendered either incorrect or useless; such is its nature that it relies on twisty, bendy and fate driven incidences to get across both its story and tragedy. I was sceptical for the best part of this film, noticing a lot of frustrations and rather a few incidences of inconsistency.<br/><br/>Firstly, I did not buy how Briony (played by three different actresses) put two and two together regarding the incident at the fountain and how she would perceive it to be anything sexual; secondly, I find it amazing how even in the 1930s it would seem a thirteen year old girl would be able to identify the ""worst word of them all."" Granted, the third occurrence of a sexual nature that happens in the library Briony observes is the most blatant but I feel if she'd spied them kissing previously or whatever instead of the incident at the fountain that had nothing to do with anything sexual, it would've made for a better build up. To sum up; I fail to see how a thirteen year old girl can honestly 'see' sexual discrimination between two people who are standing at a fountain talking; before one of them has to take their top off so that they can get into the fountain to retrieve something. But these events lead to the bigger picture because when she finds them in the library, things really screw up her psyche.<br/><br/>This is where the film's reoccurring theme of luck/chance comes in; if their hadn't been a wasp in the room, Briony wouldn't have gone to the window; if Robbie (McAvoy) hadn't sent the wrong note like he so stupidly does, everything would've been fine; if Robbie and Cecilia (Knightley) had spoken to Briony after she caught them in the library perhaps explaining what was happening and how everything would be alright, Briony wouldn't have felt as bad as she did. Little inconsistencies like this do bug me in films where the logical thing to do is substituted for sake of a story. But the initial incident also has a lot of inconsistencies; such as the fact Briony sees another example of love and/or sexual relations in the form of forced said events; in such quick proximity to one another in a certain time frame. The attacker is also stupid enough to recognise the witness that is Briony and run off without confronting her. I remember feeling that the attacker must not have known Briony otherwise they would've hung around to explain their actions  turned out they did know Briony but ran off anyway  how could they assume she didn't see their face? <br/><br/>Following said events, Robbie finds himself in France just before the Nazi invasion and the event that was the Dunkirk evacuation which is brilliantly captured in one, long take. Running parallel with this is Briony's life as a nurse in London, treating the injured. Here, I wondered why we were following Briony and this where the film makes you think it's flailing and flailing but really it's playing you because it's doing everything right. True, Briony would have no idea what's happening to Robbie in France but we are shown it anyway; instead, Cecilia is ignored only until she is visited by Briony  an event that I was tearing my hair out over when questioning the character's sanity and ability to let it all go: Robbie gives her an earful because of her action. But where I thought Atonement was going through the numbers of trying to make its apparent hero make up for past mistakes; suffer an epiphany; yadder, yadder yadder.........but no, it was playing me.<br/><br/>It may sound like I am bashing Atonement but it does the business in the end. Getting there is a little messy but the story is very smart with a real feeling of: 'what if said event hadn't happened' and the closing montage of the fates of people is stirring because you don't see it coming; you have been led to believe one thing and then had what you thought turned on its head. There is enough authenticity and beauty to be had in the photography and costume with an air of tragedy and regret flowing throughout as the film switches perspectives in a confusing but rewarding manner."

","With multiple award nominations and plenty of news hype, I decided to check out ATONEMENT strictly to see what all the hubbub was about. Is it over-hyped or does it stand out as ""The Best Picture of 2007""? The answer is both yes and no.<br/><br/>Visually it a feast for the eyes. The routing of the English army into Dunkirk is nothing short of amazing. Let me clarify that, too. We don't see the battle leading to Dunkirk but do see the aftermath in all its horribleness. The crumpled structures and damaged soldiers are dark and forbidding, and hold the viewers eyes even though one wants to look away from the destruction and seeming madness plastered on the screen. This was the most intense sequence in the entire film. It was also shot in a most uncommon way, with the camera initially following James McAvoy's character and then the camera splits from him and goes off on its own, but returns to McAvoy later. An interesting way to shoot this series of events.<br/><br/>The costumes, sets, and props were perfect. There was not a single thing that took me out of the 1930s and 1940s. Specifically I enjoyed the woolen army uniforms, the streets of early London, and the nursing uniforms the young women wore (again, all perfect).<br/><br/>The acting was good. James McAvoy (THE LAST KING OF Scotland) steals most of the show as the good-natured but ultimately wronged Robbie Turner, an educated groundskeeper at a wealthy estate owned by the family of Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN). Knightley does a fair job as Cecilia, a young woman in love with Robbie, a man far beneath her station. When Robbie is wrongfully accused of a heinous crime, Cecilia has to decide between her family or her eventual life with Robbie.<br/><br/>But more powerful than Knightley was Romola Garai who plays her sister Briony. Briony is the one responsible for wrongfully turning Robbie over to the authorities after witnessing what she believed to be him performing a crime against a child. It is Briony who really rules the movie, giving us her fervent wish for ""atonement"" later in life after realizing what damage she's caused both Robbie and her sister.<br/><br/>The powerful Vanessa Redgrave (VENUS) plays the aged Briony as the film progresses to the modern day and we learn how futile Briony's wish for atonement are. Although Mrs. Redgrave gives an astounding few minutes on film, it is only a few minutes. There've been rumors that she'll garner some award for this performance, but I hope that these rumors are unfounded. Don't get me wrong; she did a fine job. But her brief performance doesn't warrant any kind of prize.<br/><br/>Listing the good above, I have to point out that the story is not an uncommon one. This is a war story, something we've seen time and again. Director Joe Wright does some interesting camera work and manipulations with time, but some might feel this as an attempt to force something new on a genre movie goers are all too familiar with.<br/><br/>That said, one needs to be prepared for an uncharacteristic ending. If you're looking for a feel-good, man-returns-home-and-marries-girl-and-they-have-fifty-grandkids kind of movie, this one isn't going to make your happy tears list.<br/><br/>This is a mixed bag as far as films go. An overused premise with some uniquely new ideas.<br/><br/>But is it ""The Best Film of 2007""? It does have some of the best cinematography and great acting thanks to Romola Garai. But it's not the best. That prize I'm reserving for NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN."

","ATONEMENT: FOCUS 2007 color 123 m Rom/Drama Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Vanessa Redgrave, Saoirse Ronan and Brenda Blethyn star. Written by Christopher Hampton Directed by Joe Wright Rated R for language, sexuality and adult themes.<br/><br/>I was privaleged enough to see the film ""Atonement"" tonight. A film that reminds me of all the reasons I go to the movies. I couldn't possibly even begin to praise this sensational film enough but here let me try. This second pairing of director Joe Wright and Keira Knightley is even more successful than there last go around with Pride and Prejudice. Although i throughly enjoyed that film I found spots in it to be a little long and the film ultimately offered up nothing more than witty adult entertainment. This time around the film centers on three central characters Cecilia (Knightley) Robbie (McAvoy) and Briony (portrayed by three actresses through the years). Cecilia and Robbie have spent their entire lives growing up next to one another until one hot, fateful summer evening they decide to finally embrace there emotions and tell each other how they truly feel. Briony witnesses some events through child's eyes and through a moment of jealousy lies, blaming the rape of her cousin on Robbie. He is torn away from his Cecilia that very evening and it isn't until almost five years later that she finally admits to making the whole thing up. Cecilia and Robbie are separated by the lie through jail time and than war but still remain very much in love. The film chronicles many things but the central theme is the consequences of telling a lie. And how it alters the fates of everyone around it. The film is very sad. One of the most effectively emotional films ever made. It's a sumptous feast for the senses from the picturesque cinematography. Which features some of the most beautiful shots ever found on film. Shots that radiate passion, wonder, creativity and enthrallment. It also features a wildly creative score enfused with the sounds of typing reminding us of the written word and how powerful it is throughout. The performances are all top notch. It's hard to put into words on how truly great these performances are. Keira Knightley is at the top of her game here and at such a young age. She manages to embody years of longing within a single glance. James McAvoy is wonderfully handsome and a fantastic treasure to behold as Robbie a gentleman to the end. Filled with such rage and such softness at the same time. He has a stirring intenstity throughout. His chemistry with Knightley is stellar and there scenes together are hauntingly romantic and will stay with you long after the film is over. This film will stay with you long after it's over. The direction from Joe Wright is monumentous. He is one of the most talented directors out there today. Althhough he showed a spark of professionalism in his previous film. Here he grabs this story head on and makes this films every moment completely enthralling and original. This may be the best film I've ever seen. I have emotions streaming out of my every pore and a headful of memories from the film that feel like my own. It's very rare to see such a spectacle. In the words of my friend it's just a privilege really. Atonement captures what the Notebook and Titanic aimed for but couldn't quite engulf. It's more than the best film of the year and one of the best films I've ever seen. It's one of the best experiences I've ever had.<br/><br/>*****/5"

"bernardodelcast","4","1","1","7 October 2019"," Some highs, many lows.
","I was very interested in watching this movie, I like the cast, and I had previously enjoyed the director's take on Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>Sadly this is one beautifully shot disappointment.<br/><br/>From the start, the conceits that make the events unfold seemed fancyful and contrived.
The ""wrong letter"" being sent, and then being surprisingly available as evidence, the perfunctory and almost non-existent character interactions, it all feels detached, ficticious and staged.<br/><br/>Adding to that, the poetic, dreamlike camerawork, furthers this disconnection, who are these characters? We never know their real conflicts or motivations, we just see events. So as viewers, we are forced to ponder but expected to empathize with almost no reason to.
Even the main titular romance that we are supposed to care about is underdeveloped (if it is developed at all), was it the class struggle? Why had they grown seemingly cold to each other? Were they just lustful or actually in love?
We are never told.<br/><br/>Maybe this is intentional, as by the end we learn all the narrative is possibly just Briony's version of the events, and she is an unreliable narrator that doesn't want to adorn the narrative with fancyful embellishments. But this fails in two levels: firstly, as a novel and as a movie, theres a cold shallowness to it, It would be a very bland novel. And secondly it feels disingenuous because the movie is FILLED with flights of fancy and embellishments.
So we move down a list of very unsubtle scenes that barely functionally connect the narrative threads without really ever saying anything purposeful (the scene where the rapist marries his victim and Briony refuses to speak up comes across as a blunt and nearly ridiculous allegory for the movie itself).<br/><br/>Some moments however did connect with me. Scenes such as the french soldier dying, or even when briony slips away in the middle of the night to write, paint a little more characterization and actual textures to this world and characters. But these are few and far between.<br/><br/>And finally there is the epilogue, or the twist.
In some ways this is a clever turn that makes a lot of the movie's more poetic aspirations more significant. If this really is Briony's perspective, it makes sense that shes focused on specific moments that are meaningful to her even if they dont give the audience the answers.
However it also is a slap in the face, as it basically is a twist on the old cliche of ""it was all a dream"".
Moreover it is hard to swallow that she fails to include any significant moments of conflict or characterization, which would most likely be pivotal and crucial if she was to tell the story earnestly.
It comes as a weak, arrogant excuse to call it attonement, and to justify her silence as saying honesty would have helped no one. Because then why does she feel the need to be honest now?
And lets not forget, she's even lying in her absolution, to give them the life they should have had? Who? They died for her actions and she still shys away of accepting the full responsibility.<br/><br/>Even more offensively to me, the movie presents her as some sort of tragic figure, trying to do something nice for the people she hurt now that she's dying. But it all rings fake, egotistical and hollow.<br/><br/>Attonement there is none."

Atonement is, in its simplest form, one of the best acts of storytelling in cinema history. This film is much more than a story, it's a view changer!

"kitellis-98121","9","1","1","15 August 2018"," Exquistite filmmaking. An epic masterpiece.
","I have, in the past, been somewhat harsh in my criticisms of Joe Wright's films. After my first viewing of Atonement, I found myself rather badly ""triggered"" by its ending (which I still hate), and that certainly affected my appraisal of the film overall, leaving me with the lingering impression that I'd hated the whole thing. After seeing Hanna, which I found almost unwatchable, I may have allowed my thought's about Wright's directorial style to become unfairly negative. (I'd also seen Pride and Prejudice, and found it aesthetically pleasing but otherwise somewhat limp).<br/><br/>So when I recently watched Darkest Hour, and found myself breathless and giddy with enthusiasm, and loudly proclaiming it a cinematic masterpiece, it dawned on me that I should perhaps give Wright's films another chance. So, with gritted teeth I sat down to revisit Atonement. And was blown away!<br/><br/>From the very first moment I was captivated. The cinematography was stunning. Literally every shot was lit and composed in such a way that you could take any random frame from the movie, print it, and hang it in an art gallery! The early scenes perfectly evoked the bucolic charms of an English country estate in the 1930s, with all the elegance, opulence, and sexual undercurrents that form the set-up for a darkly troubling story. Every aspect of the period detail was beautifully done, with gorgeous wardrobe, immaculate art-direction, and a jarringly bold and original music score. The writing was sublime, as were every one of the performances; filled with depth, nuance, and truthfulness. The spellbinding, icily assured performance from Saoirse Ronan, deftly directed by Wright, holds the whole first act together, portraying a complex miasma of innocence, jealousy, and repressed sexuality, which forms the foundation upon which the rest of the film is built.<br/><br/>The second act lurches jarringly out of the picturesque countryside into epic scenes of World War II, depicted with bombastic realism and cinematic flair, including the famous and much celebrated 5-minute tracking shot on the Dunkirk beach. Again the art-direction and cinematography are sensational. Here, Wright shows his skill at going LARGE. Every scene, be it in France or in London, is filled with thousands of milling extras, period vehicles, and superbly choreographed activity, all captured with sweeping camera moves and lit entirely for artistic effect rather than mere illumination. It is a visual feast. Every shot resembles a painting.<br/><br/>The third act is also very well made. But it is here that the film falls down - at least for me. And it is ENTIRELY the fault of the novel upon which the film is based. I just hate where the story goes. I can stick with it right up to the point that Vanessa Redgrave appears. The shocking reveal in her interview ruins everything. It pulls the rug out from under me. As a viewer, it is like a slap in the face. It cruelly mocks me for being gullible and romantic....<br/><br/>--------------------SPOILER WARNING--------------------<br/><br/>If it had just shown the deaths when they actually occurred, it would have been a tragic film, but a beautiful one, and I could have lived with that. But to give them a fake happy ending, and then say ""Ha, Ha, only kidding. They died really!"" was cruel and unkind to the audience. And then, to suggest that by making up a fake happy ending it served as ""atonement"" because it ""gave them their happiness"" (to paraphrase) really added insult to injury. It served only to make the wrongdoer feel better. The people whose lives she ruined died without ever finding their happiness. And now the audience must suffer the same fate! Thanks a bunch! (Ooops, I may be getting triggered again!)<br/><br/>So, I hate the ending. But this time round, forearmed with the knowledge of what was going to happen, I was able to view the film more objectively, and endure the lousy ending without it eclipsing the preceding masterpiece. For which I am most grateful.<br/><br/>I am not one of those shallow, unsophisticated people who requires happy endings, or for things to be tied up neatly with pretty bows. I just strongly object to the very specific and particular way that Atonement went about its ending.<br/><br/>But I no longer blame Joe Wright. Which is nice, since I have fond memories of him from when we were kids. He is a master filmmaker, and despite still not loving ALL of his work, I hold him in the highest respect, and consider at least two of his films to be bona fide masterpieces."
"kathryn-org","9","1","1","26 April 2016"," People seem to be misunderstanding the scope of the word ""atonement.""
","I have never reviewed a movie but I had to put in my two cents to defend this film. I feel it needs to be said that the theme of atonement is so prolific that it is easy to almost miss most of the symbolism. The sister, Cecelia was placed in a physical cross position two times in the film. Once in the library and once floating in the water in the subway after she died. It isn't so far fetched to conclude that she was the one atoning for her sister's sins. Along with Robbie. (he was atoning for the sins of Mr. Sleezy chocolate factory.) France was frankly atoning for the sins of Germany- and so was Robbie as he was forced to fight in the war- and eventually die for the sins of Hitler. As did Celia. <br/><br/>There is no reason to assume that the atonement referred to by the title of the movie is in reference to Briony's attempt at righting a wrong. But that also fits neatly in with the theme. This film shows, in many ways, people paying the price for other people sins. And it also poses the question, can a person atone for their own sins? Is it even possible? Even Lola and her brothers were paying the price of their parents wrong decisions in a way. <br/><br/>I watched this film having no expectations. And I do agree with some of the other reviews. Did people even know ""that awful word"" in the 30's? And certainly the library scene was just too much too soon to be believable. But I loved the movie because of the questions it asks and the way it approaches the very many sides of ""atoning.""<br/><br/>When looked at from a traditional Christian perspective, a person most definitely can not atone for their own sins. It must be done by another. I wonder if Briony was a victim of someone else's sins as well? (Sleezy chocolate factory man.)<br/><br/>I gave the film a 9 because it was slow at times and because I can't remember the name of chocolate man."

","""I wouldn't necessarily believe everything Briony tells you. She's rather fanciful."" - Cecilia Tallis<br/><br/>Joe Wright directs ""Atonement"", a film based on a novel by Ian McEwan. The plot? In 1935, the thirteen year old daughter of a wealthy family, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), falsely accuses a servant's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), of sexually abusing a teenage girl. Turner is arrested and jailed for this alleged crime. This arrest tears Robbie away from Briony's older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), a woman whom he loves. <br/><br/>""Atonement's"" first half is mostly excellent. Stylishly directed, the film watches as Briony misreads the adult world around her. To her naive eyes, the sexual tension between Cecilia and Robbie thus constitutes a ""perversion"". A ""perversion"" which Briony decides makes Robbie a ""sex maniac"" and so ""rapist"". That adults readily believe Briony's story speaks to the inequities and injustices of Britain's firmly entrenched class system. <br/><br/>At the half-way mark, though, ""Atonement"" morphs into another film. Here Robbie joins the army, is sent to France, fights in World War 2, sees many horrors, assembles in Dunkirk with thousands of other soldiers and dies of septicaemia. All the while, Robbie and Cecilia pine for one another. Deeply in love, they're never reunited. Briony blames herself for this. The film closes with Briony, now an elderly woman, writing a fantastical novel in which Robbie and Cecilia live ""happily ever after"", a gesture which Briony hopes will exonerate Robbie and so atone for her lies. <br/><br/>""Atonement's"" second half is mostly kitsch. Tastelessly voluptuous, the film unfolds like a bad David Lean movie (""Brief Encounter"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Ryan's Daughter""), every moment straining for unwarranted grandeur. By the time Wright hits us with his virtuosic Dunkirk sequence – an elaborate long take that seems pulled from Jancso's ""The Red and the White"" - it's hard not to laugh. The film has stopped being about people and problems, and started being about expensively dressed clichés. Robbie and Cecilia aren't just a couple of lovers, but a monument to every tragically wronged couple. They aren't just torn apart, but torn apart by WAR, ruined by RAPE and separated by OCEANS! Because the elderly Briony is suffering from ""vascular dementia"", and because the younger Briony is a childish romantic, Wright assumes that his aesthetic, which is florid, fantastical and at times unreliable (the film's soundtrack contains a feverishly typing typewriter), is befitting. Wright's film, after-all, is the very hokey novel Briony is writing. But self-conscious kitsch is still kitsch. More importantly, though McEwan's prose was similarly overwrought, he was parodying readers who yearn for kitsch. Wright, in contrast, is dead serious; he genuinely loves kitsch.<br/><br/>Virtually all of McEwan's books find adults and children losing their innocence after encountering some traumatic event. Consider ""The Child in Time"", in which a missing child shatters a couple's domestic existence. Consider too ""Enduring Love"", in which a balloon accident torments a middle-aged couple, and ""The Cement Garden"", in which children cover up and deal with the deaths of their parents.<br/><br/>McEwan's lead characters also typically carry a corruptive secret which gradually expels them from their families or communities. Be it pregnancies, rapes, illicit romances or murders, his characters tortuously conceal this secret, only to cathartically release it during the novel's climax. We see this in ""Atonement"". But Briony's crime is not simply that she is a liar and bad novelist, but that she acts like a novelist at all. For McEwan, Briony is guilty of creating fiction. She is guilty of storytelling, which is seen to be inherently corrupt and corrupting. This resolutely postmodern theme – the unreliability of ""art"" and its inability to convey the ""whole truth"" – has long been McEwan's pet obsession. As such, McEwan's novel persecutes both Briony and his readers for their compulsive need to tidy up life's messiness with familiar plots and neat resolutions. Time and time again, McEwan condemns the limiting projections of artists, the trite desires of readers and demonstrates the implications of fictionality. The result is a novel, like Nabokov's ""Lolita"", which attempts to comment on its obvious falsity (its construction as fiction, and the dangers this masks), whilst at the same time trying to convey ""reality"". None of this is captured in Wright's ""Atonement"", which works primarily as an old-fashioned tale of love interuptus. <br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing. See any film by Atom Egoyan for this material done better."
"mboyd1986","4","1","1","20 April 2014"," Plagiarism or What?
","Has nobody else watched ""Somewhere In Time""? <br/><br/>In ""Atonement"", Cecilia must say the phrase ""Come back to me"" at least half a dozen times, and that is the key phrase that is spoken in ""Somewhere In Time"" by Elise to Richard. And that phrase is the trigger for the whole, brilliant, moving film.<br/><br/>So every time I hear Cecilia say it to Robbie, I am reminded of the much better, more romantic film (with a decent ending, too) called ""Somewhere In Time"", starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.<br/><br/>And for those who are looking for ""Similar movies"" - see the message board at the bottom of page 1 - the film ""Somewhere In Time"" beats this one hands down! And it has fantastic music."

What started out with the promise of a lush romantic tale eventually both did and did not fulfill that promise, in the most intriguing way. This movie was very well acted, emotionally resonant, and occasionally breathtaking in its cinematic techniques (e.g., a single panning shot against the backdrop of a massive set filled with a couple thousand people and animals, complex in its execution; a lighting change that achieved a powerful emotional effect). The costumes were gorgeous and effective, the settings were a perfect complement to the characters' emotions, and the character interactions were compelling. An experience you'll never forget!"

Basically everything that happens goes from bad to worse and ends with everyone's lives in shattered pieces and dead.

So caught up in her dramatic wants and angry, she lies, and that lie haunts her for her remaining days. This is a movie version of a wonderful book, the best I read that year. It captures the pain and the need to make true restitution. The truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. The characters come to realize that. It's a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost. Probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life, but carries around her guilt to her dying day. She is never allowed to truly enjoy things. This is a really fine movie and, except for some breaks in editing, does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","1 September 2008"," A fine romantic drama that doubles as an exploration of perception & storytelling
","Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" concerns a fledgling writer who accuses her older sister's lover of a crime that he didn't commit, thus changing their lives irrevocably. Eventually she seeks to atone for her actions and what on the surface seems to be merely romantic melodrama evolves subtly over the course of the film into something wholly unique.<br/><br/>The cast is well-assembled with fine performances all around, though perhaps none that are particularly outstanding. Saorise Ronan, as the young Briony Tallis, received an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category. She showed herself fully able, at a young age (13), to match the high standard put forth by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The story is an interesting one, though the chain of events leading up to the accusation somewhat stretches the limits of plausibility. These events are easier to accept in the end, though, as certain facts come to light which cast doubts on the entire story. I should note that the script garnered a not undeserved Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The direction by Joe Wright is excellent, so I am baffled by the fact that he didn't even receive a Best Director Oscar nomination. His debut, ""Pride and Prejudice"", showed promise and here he delivers on that promise. The art direction, costumes & cinematography all received Oscar nominations so it should be apparent that the film is easy on the eyes. The only Oscar win for the film was for the score, which is quite unique and memorable.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend the film though some may find the romantic aspect off-putting. Nevertheless, let it be known that this film is not merely throwaway romantic fluff; there is indeed plenty of substance here for the discerning viewer."
"yousoldmysoulforpogs","8","1","1","27 August 2008"," A thing or two left to be desired, but an excellent movie experience
","I think the film is great. It got me emotionally involved, and I successfully empathised with Robbie, Cecilia and Bryony. The plot, whilst the ending is not anywhere near as exciting as the beginning, is almost play-like in its vivid events and character interaction - something I admired.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't think it's perfect personally. Partly through the film, during the war scenes, the momentum of the film takes a step back. I believe that, after seeing the film, the celebrated five-minute Dunkirk beach scene that people have mentioned is positively over-rated, and didn't prove to be an interesting or integral part of the story. Other than this, the film is a certain thought-provoker, and a great demonstration of human sensibility.<br/><br/>What can I say about the acting by all those involved? Flawless. And the romance and passion and guilt portrayed in the film is simply brimming. It's worth a watch undoubtedly."
"shi612","9","1","1","3 August 2008"," Fullfiling movie time
","I had a fulfilling time with this movie. A fulfilling movie makes you think about many things even after seeing it.<br/><br/>A 13 years old girl Briony has wild imagination always. Even from a single word like ""castle"" she can imagine many things. This girl makes irrevocable sin through her imagination to her sister Cecilia and her lover Robbie. Finally, she atones for the sin through her further imagination work.<br/><br/>When and how Briony realized the sin of her wrong imagination is not explained well. How much Cecilia understood about the imagination of Briony was not explained well too. However, at the last scene, we know how seriously Briony thought about the atonement, and how carefully all scenes were put together to portray the story.<br/><br/>As for performance, Saoirse Ronan acting as younger Briony, and James McAvoy as Bobby are outstanding."
"bobsgrock","8","1","1","15 June 2008"," Good, but doesn't belong with the best.
","I must admit, after all I heard from the critics about Atonement not being one of the best films of 2007, I didn't watch it expecting to be one. Nevertheless, I felt it was better than given credit for all the way around. The look is very good, especially in the first third set in the gigantic house of the Tallis' in England. However, as the mood of the film transposes, so does the quality of it. The young daughter, Briony, falsely accuses her older sister's lover of attacking her sister. This leads to serious conflict as well as the separation of the star-crossed lovers, Robbie and Cecilia. As the years go on, Briony becomes more and more guilty of what she did and Robbie fights in the war, facing death at every corner. The ending and the build-up to it is very well executed, as is most of the film. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, the acting is solid, and the writing is clever in many regards. However, what keeps Atonement from No Country or There Will Be Blood greatness is the lack of depth to the characters, especially the central ones of Robbie and Cecilia. We never really get to know about their relationship and it doesn't make for a great payoff at the end. The film is still very well-made and doesn't falter too badly, but the lagging in the middle and lack of character depth keeps it from being Best Picture-worthy and one of the best films of a very strong 2007."
"futures-1","Null","1","1","11 May 2008"," Clarification at last
","""Atonement"" (2007): With hesitations: I need to see this one a second time. It may go up or down in my categories. There's no doubt the acting, lighting, and photography were great. The 1930's story has too much of what I've long been weary  Constipated English Gentry. There is a glossy, invisible division between the viewer and the characters, making them seem less real. The story jumps around and often morphs, which I didn't mind, but doubted its usefulness until the last 15 minutes, when it was finally clarified. It didn't take long to understand the idea of ""atonement"", but I WAS caught by surprise as to how it was all happening. This was interesting to me, and finally removed the ""glossiness"" with which I had trouble."
"dave-sturm","8","1","1","26 April 2008"," Writers lie to us
","I read the novel before seeing the movie so I knew what I was going to see. Ian MacEwan's book is about how writers always cheat. You really should know that going in because I think a lot of people expected ""Ryan's Daughter"" or some other sweeping historical romance that may end tragically, but movingly. The ending of ""Atonement"" is not tragic. It is absurd. <br/><br/>In a way, the movie ending copped out. The book ended with an internal monologue by Briony at her own crowded, happy birthday party. The book reveals her own pretensions to have given Robbie and Cecelie ""a life together"" when in fact she really just wrote a happy ending to alleviate her own guilt. It's pathetic and shows how Briony is still the selfish brat she always was. And there was no final scene on the beach in the book. The book is deeply, deeply bitter. It's wrong to slap on a fantasy-on-the-beach ending.<br/><br/>Still, most of the movie was captivating, what with the masterful tracking shot, the musical typewriter. The suburban American audience I saw it with gasped out loud when they saw Robbie's typewriter slam out the most taboo word in the English language. David Lean ""Atonement"" is not.<br/><br/>Ian MacEwan writes fairly transgressive fiction. Too bad the filmmakers weren't willing to go the distance."
"dawh1","8","1","1","19 April 2008"," Emotional but not realistic
","This film is highly moving, but if I understand it correctly, Briony gave evidence in good faith. Later on she came to realize that she was mistaken and she regretted what she did. But if Robbie had had a good lawyer, this lawyer could have shaken her testimony. She saw the rapist from behind, and he was one of three (four?) men dressed in identical formal wear and about the same height and age. That should not have been enough to convict him without some other evidence. It must be a terrible thing to be convicted of a crime you didn't commit, and I'm sure it happens all the time, but it's only in the way the writer has chosen to tell the story that everything is Briony's fault."
"shekhoosraja","8","1","1","5 April 2008"," Wonderfully crafted emotional adaptation
","The title, Atonement means to make up for what has been done. This film, thus portrays a mistake made in love, which must be repaid with sacrifice and pain. The emotional content for such a topic must be strong and the expression of the same should be clear and moving. This film stands up to this.<br/><br/>An adaption from Ian McEwan's Novel 'Atonement', the film is based in the countryside of Britain and then some surrounding areas later on. The background score, first of all is very unique and rhythmic. Its suits and enhances the feel conspiracy, thrill and suspense which this is the base of the movie. Its mostly, taps of the typewriter, wonderfully set with shots by clever editing. At a few places, the sync of music and cuts is amazing. The cinematography and art direction is good too. The colour variations throughout the film, are wisely used to create emotions. <br/><br/>The story basically is about Cecilia Tallis(Kiera Knightly) and Robbie Turner(James McAvoy). They live in a mansion of countryside Britain. Robbbie once mistakenly proposes to make love to Cecilia, who agrees. While they are doing it, Cecilia's little sister Briony Tallis sees them. Being a suspicious child she reacts aggressively and later on blames Robbie of a very serious crime. He is sent to jail on the basis on her testimony. War breaks out. Robbie as a prisoner is sent to war as a soldier. A pile of grief, in the form of this news falls on Cecilia, who had been eagerly waiting to be together with him again. She leaves her home and joins army as a nurse. The war goes on, both lovers eagerly wait to meet each other. And Briony, who had caused all this chaos, is left in deep guilt, waiting for a chance for atonement.<br/><br/>A very impressive story this is, drawn out really well with great performances by all actors and very sensible and clever work by the technical team. A must watch."
"rhinocerosfive-1","8","1","1","2 April 2008"," lovely, just lovely, for awhile
","A very pretty and engaging tale of redemption, whether we need it or not, rather wonderfully directed by Joe Wright, whose Austen I didn't think quite as much of. Christopher Hampton manages for the most part not to make too much noise clanking his quill against the ink bottle, leaving Ian McEwan's novel more or less alone.<br/><br/>The first half of this movie dances by like a whimsical reverie, sweetness and hope piling atop playful forebodings. It moans and runs a little out of breath at Dunkirk, but that's Dunkirk, isn't it? A fever dream of pure hot horror. Not the Mrs Miniver version at any rate. The remainder of the picture pants and starts, breathless and troubled, eventually waking to gasp in miserable regret at the nature of truth and the power of illusion. The story's early lightness is finally reconciled with its ultimately bleak ending, and all's miserable that ends miserably.<br/><br/>The women in this picture are uniformly superb. Keira Knightley is poised and fetching as ever, proof that God plays favorites - girls who look like this sometimes can have other gifts too. But the film relies most on three performances of immense depth and compassion: Saoirse Ronan, Vanessa Redgrave and in particular Romola Garai, all of whom portray the same woman at various stages of petulance and penitence."

The scenery and back ground shots were outstanding. The war scenes was outstanding. My kind of movie. I loved the ending. I'll watch it again, many times. This film should have won the Oscar. I loved Michael Clayton and thought No Country for Old Men was disgusting to be an Oscar winner. This movie should be considered one of the great war movies of all time.

"ajlara79","9","1","1","18 March 2008"," A masterpiece of recent cinema
","There is a historical discrepancy in this movie, for which I remove a star: the sailor in the Dunkirk Beaches relates that the Lancastria had floundered the day before, carrying with it 3,000 lives. The Lancastria did not really sink off Dunkirk but close to St. Nazaire and about two weeks later during Operation Ariel (try wikipedia.org) This event was a smaller -but still large- evacuation after General Weygand's plan, to counterattack the Germans northwards from the River Somme, failed and the British and French forces were pushed into the northwest coast of France. This was perhaps the biggest loss for the Brits during the War of France, because in comparison to the success of Dunkirk, an important number of troops was caught prisoners inside the city, the Germans having stormed in before they could embark. I highly recommend reading Churchill's War Memoirs if this chapter of history is of your interest. This remarkable and admirable leader won the Nobel price for his work, which is a way more valid and fair award than the highly criticized Oscar (which in my frank opinion under-rated such a delightful movie)."
"blackburnj-1","9","1","1","8 February 2008"," Breathtaking, heartbreaking, but flawed
","Ian McEwen's brilliant novel is one of the most popular of recent years. Ever since it was published in 2001 it seemed as if it was destined for the screen. However, there are undoubted problems with adapting it for cinema. The structure is anything but cinematic and there are so many perspectives that the novel is written from that adapting it successfully seemed impossible. This is nowhere near as detailed or as electric as the novel, but that would be impossible. This is a successful adaptation of a difficult novel that is filled with invention, quality and is genuinely beautiful.<br/><br/>The starting point with any film is the script and Christopher Hampton's script can only be described as tough. It does a very hard job quite well. It is interesting, genuinely well written but he fails to do justice to the novel. The latter part doesn't matter, as each adaptation deserves to be taken on its own merits, but it doesn't manage to be quick enough at points and the film chooses to centre on the romance more than the real central character, Briony. As such, she suffers a bit.<br/><br/>However, Joe Wright must be commended for his fine work on this film. He lifts the film from what the script is and introduces a lavish visual style to every frame, genuinely interesting directorial touches and, whilst this film is by no means perfect, he shows great potential. He evokes the heat of the English summer, the passion of the central relationship and the horror of the Second World War with apparent ease. The result is a film that is genuinely heartbreaking and breathtaking.<br/><br/>The film is assisted by a supremely good ensemble. James McAvoy is the standout. He is spectacular as Robbie Turner and takes the weight of this film on his shoulders and carries it off superbly. The lack of awards consideration he's received is scandalous. Keira Knightley delivers her best performance to date, but is still somewhat outshone here. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant, as is Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave, all in the role of Briony.<br/><br/>The visual style is near perfect. The cinematography is stunning, as is the costume, the production design and the make-up. However, the score is quite astounding. Dario Marianelli produces some ingenious music that incorporates the strangely lyrical sound of the typewriter with a superb orchestral score and emotive piano solos.<br/><br/>All of these elements contribute to an excellent film. It is also helped by some quite extraordinary sequences, most notably the four and a half minute long tracking shot of the beaches on Dunkirk that shows the horror of that retreat and is breathtaking, but there are four or five of these moments. It is a flawed film, but it is a fine one. A film that doesn't have to be seen, but should be seen. Wright shows himself to be a promising director and McAvoy appears to be a tremendous actor. But, ultimately, this film shows the visual power of cinema and its potential, even if this is not a perfect example of it."
"meeza","8","1","1","4 February 2008"," Positive film review tone for Atonement
","My original psyche of the period film ""Atonement"" was that it was going to be formulaic brit piece comprised of a bunch of socialites talking fancy, maids & butlers eavesdropping, protagonists trivializing major issues while defocusing on mundane matters, and all that ""mumbo jumbo"" talk that you get from the cinema Britannica. I must state that ""Atonement"" did encompass a few of the aforementioned elements, but the final product turned out to be a very enlightening film about atoning for one's immaturity. So ""Atonement"", I am truly sorry I did you like that. Because after ""I saw it with my own eyes"", I recognized that it did not merit my preconceived notion. I must atone myself now by writing a positive film review for ""Atonement"". The narrative stars James McAvoy and Keira Knightley portraying the romantic leads Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis. Robbie is the son of a Tallis' housekeeper and Cecilia is the eldest daughter of the wealthy Tallis family. So you see that Robbie does not have it ""made"" and Cecilia is constantly financially nurtured by those ""Benjamin tallies""; or whatever Prime Minister is printed in the British currency bill. Robbie and Cecilia romantically fall for each other and are on route for the eventual nuptial until the visual disaster occurs. That would come in the form of Briony Tallis (played by Saoirse Ronan), the youngest Tallis who has a massive crush on Robbie, and her ravaging jealousy causes her to falsely witness a crime which she accuses Robbie as being the perpetrator. Poor Robbie gets convicted of the crime and ends up fighting in a war in order not to get jail time. So you can say that Robbie and Cecilia are apart because of the brawny Briony syndrome. The developmental plot of ""Atonement"" focuses on Briony in various stages in her life trying to make amends on the hell she caused, and also on Robbie and Cecilia's emotional solitary grief. The performances from McAvoy, Knightley, and Ronan hit the right thespian tone of ""Atonement"". Admirable brawny supporting work was also contributed by Romola Garai (who played Briony at age 18) and the legendary Vanessa Redgrave (who played the geriatric Briony). Director Joe Wright, who also helmed ""Pride & Prejudice"", should be proud of his unprejudiced direction of ""Atonement"". The costume design, art direction, and cinematography of ""Atonement"" were of picturesque amazement. Christopher Hampton's scribe was adequate but not Oscar-worthy; even though I love the ""I saw him with my own eyes"" line; It was an eye-opener! So all in all, you will not be sorry if you check out ""Atonement"". **** Good"

","Focus Features has finally gotten it straight in this excellent movie; showing love between a man and a woman. A fine story it is, one of the few films of 2007 aimed at the adult (over 12) audience. Fresh and original, what more could we ask for? Keira Knightly is always a sight to behold. At 5'7"" with super slender model looks, I don't think she has a single fat cell in her body. Any man who's actually held a girl like this will never again settle for the Playboy centerfold stereotype. Her acting is also excellent.<br/><br/>During 2007, intelligent moviegoers had little to choose from. ""Eastern Promises"" was great, as was ""Juno."" But then there was ""No Country For Old Men"" -- a slasher flick for pseudo-intellectual empty-heads and the stupidest movie of 2007. ""No Country"" was pretty well rejected at the box office, but the mental midgets are still trying to peddle it via the Oscars. Don't fall for it!

Futures occurrences happen before the past, a flipping back and forth, sometimes with a difference of several years other times only several minutes. This gave the movie an interesting texture and made it more artistically enjoyable yet clear since flipping back and showing what lead up to the crucial occurrence clarified the plot.<br/><br/>Being a little slow, epic, and overly sentimental it may arouse romantics and annoy pragmatics The ending is heartfelt and sentimental as she does what she can (incorporating into her lifestyle) to atone for her past act of indiscretion"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","1","3 January 2008"," ""Atonement"" exemplifies cinematic mastery, only lacking in action
","If one were taking a course on how to appropriately adapt a novel for the big screen, ""Atonement' would certainly need to be among the required materials. Though I personally have never read McEwan's novel, the attention to detail that Joe Wright and his team bring to telling this story visually is superb.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" is the story of a young girl named Briony (played well by three actresses at different ages of her life) with a very incurable appetite and curiosity for plot and drama, enough so that she tells a lie that separates her sister Cecilia (Knightley) from her newly discovered love of Robbie (McAvoy), the son of their mansion's grounds keeper. The rest of the film is the consequences of Briony's actions and her struggle to forgive herself for what she did. <br/><br/>The acting is top notch, but not as deserving of accolades as the production crew and the minds behind the cinematic telling of this story. The art direction and Wright's choices are simple and beautiful and most notably is Dario Marianelli's original score that is both creative and effective, particularly in the beginning and end of the film.<br/><br/>The only thing holding ""Atonement"" back is the middle of the film, which lacks attention- grabbing substance. The symbolism is all over the place, but the plot lacks a distinct something during the point in which Robbie and Cecilia are separated to really grip the viewer as the film's wonderful ending reveals itself. I can't believe that I would be the only one who really needed more convincing of the love and passion between them.<br/><br/>That said, the story is still Briony's story at heart, hence the film's title, and her story is told with brilliance. Unfortunately, the aforementioned middle part keeps her out of the story for a significant amount of time. The film, therefore, requires patience and really keen eye for the the subtlety that makes a film more than just a story told with a camera."

","This was a very good movie, but for reasons not normally listed here. To me I focused on the moral aspect, and the devastation which can be caused by its aftermath. I believe the girl suffered regret from when the realization struck home as the police drove the accused away. But instead of going the full distance to put things right, she worked at a job her 'society' posing would have let her bypass, and perhaps tried to make things right with herself more so than with the others.<br/><br/>So the moral of the story? We all know that as we grow older a heartbeat can be enough time to take us from here to where death will take us. If we've done wrong, and it has and is hurting others, then the time to put things right is now. And the reason no better than it is simply the right thing to do. Forgiveness may be forthcoming, but it's got to be by-product of the process, not the reason.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, but I like mostly how it reminded me of what the wages of sin carries, and how that weight is sometimes careless upon whom it chooses to bear its burden.<br/><br/>i think the young couple suffered greatly"

I don't think I completely understood the film in the first place, but it still doesn't nearly live up to the hype. The film is very slow, as in there is a lot of waiting to see what would happen next. So, you wait, and then expect something big to happen, but it never does. The entire middle part of the film was a bore to me. Parts of the ending seemed good at first, but by then, I already had negative impressions on the film. Throughout the film there were shots that were beautifully shot and some good touching scenes, but the film doesn't do much for me. I am rather mad at all of you who claim this to be the best film of the year or whatnot. I obviously missed something, or you views are just into this type of ""artsy"" film. That's another thing too.....this film seemed to try to hard to be artsy and to touch on people's emotions. All it did was drag on and on. Once I lost interest, it never came back.<br/><br/>Having said all of this, I may just have to watch the film again on DVD. I'm curious what important info I happened to miss.......if all of you claim it to be so good.

","Atonement is a majestic and moving novel, one of my favourites by one of my favourite authors, so I approached the movie with optimism and trepidation in equal measure.<br/><br/>I need not have worried; it is executed with impeccable taste, brilliantly directed, acted, soundtracked and photographed. Surely it will do some damage at the Oscars. <br/><br/>It's essentially a caustic attack on the class society in England where the stiff upper lip leads to all sorts of under-the-radar cruelty.<br/><br/>James McAvoy (essentially a bit of a Lady Chatterley's lover being as he is the housemaid's son) falls for the toffee-nosed Cecilia Tallis, (Keira Knightley)and, in the process, drives her 13 year old sister into a fit of jealousy that has tragic consequences for McAvoy. <br/><br/>This is magnified when the young Brioney (brilliantly played by Saoirse Ronan) acts as go-between between the aforementioned James McAvoy (now certainly one of Britain's best actors) and Knightley (who carries the part off more than adequately).<br/><br/>The film is in three acts. The first set in Brideshead Revisited English opulence, the second in Northern France around the D Day landings and containing a 5 minute steadicam tracking shot that takes the breathe away, the third in the suburbs of war torn London.<br/><br/>Each is rendered differently and observed immaculately. In the snobbery of pre-war rural England the tension can be cut with a knife and the language and mannerisms of upper class torpor are fantastically realised.<br/><br/>The war scenes, aside from the amazing tracking shot, are less well executed (budget restrictions methinks) but the ending is deeply satisfying.<br/><br/>Special applause has to be reserved for Dario Mariavrelli's soundtrack which uses the sound of typewriter keystrokes as a hugely original percussion instrument that adds energy to the whole piece.<br/><br/>Brilliant.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I won't rehash the major plot points because enough reviewers have done so. The problem with this film: the motivation for the characters' behaviors is undeveloped (non-existent, really). What could Robbie and Cecilia possibly have in common other than sexual/physical attraction? That certainly isn't enough to warrant 4-5 years of pining for one another.<br/><br/>Why does Briony falsely accuse Robbie of her cousin's rape? Has she always been living in Cecilia's shadow and sees an opportunity to gain attention for herself? Is she jealous because, at this point in her life, she lacks the physical beauty of her older sister? As the son of a servant, Robbie would have known from birth that the daughters of the house were off limits. And why, in the name of God, does the poor rape victim marry her attacker years later?! Nauseating!<br/><br/>If Briony wanted to atone why didn't she seek out the authorities and recant her horrible lie? Writing a novel about Robbie & Cecilia with a happy ending instead of the tragic truth doesn't even begin to make things right.

If the evacuation had been as depicted, it is no wonder the BEF was in retreat. They would have needed to go home and learn military tactics. As for the black soldier, where did he come from? <br/><br/>For me the best scenes were in the hospital with Gina McKee as Sister Drummond, the true martinet of the times, running the hospital like a boot camp, but why did she not set the nursing trainees straight about floppy hair falling out of caps? At that time hair had to be firmly held in place and not a stray hair loose. The scenes of nurses mopping floors and being used as skivvies was certainly correct.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the sloppy continuity and cutting back and forth confusing, in addition to which they seem to have got the dates wrong. A little reference to the history books would not have hurt. I especially cringed when someone referred to a character being evacuated TO Dunkirk! And I had always thought it was FROM Dunkirk - well, well!"
"tompinter","3","4","9","28 May 2008"," A disappointing failure
","In watching this film, and other recent films, it occurs to me that film making is returning to the era of silent films. By this I mean that scenes with minimal dialog or no dialog are becoming more common. This is not bad in itself since this is film and not a novel; however, in silent films the scenes advance the plot--in this film they do not. The silent scenes are poses that neither advance the plot nor shed insight into the characters. Poses, no matter how well shot, do not comprise a scene.<br/><br/>For the film to hold together, character motivations are important. This is really what is missing in this film. There was no reason presented for Briony to behave as she did, envy comes to mind but clearly this is not her motive. The original setting was 1936 upper class England, so the dialog among the children did not fit the times, which makes the transparent motive, the child's overwrought imagination, suspect.<br/><br/>Since I have not read the novel I can not comment on whether the characters and motivations were more clearly defined. But the film is a failure in both plot and character development."

","With a title like ""atonement"" we expect something moral and uplifting. What we get instead is the self-gratifying maunderings of an aging authoress of bodice rippers: as a spoiled child she ruins three lives by lying (or letting her imagination go wild, which is the same thing); those with ruined lives are killed in WW2, but our ""heroine"" (the little snot) goes on to write 21 novels, the last of which is her confession. She writes her (dead) victims a happy ending. Is that atonement? No, it's yet another act of selfishness. The film is suitably atmospheric, and the morays and habits of the British upper class continues to mystify, but this is only an entertainment, wholly unworthy of the title.

"majic-5","4","4","9","4 January 2008"," Cliché-ridden and emotionally inauthentic
","I'm likely the worst person to write a review of this type of movie. Films about the upper class British set in the Victorian era, the pre-WWI period, or between WWI and WWII have always bored me to sleep. Emotions get reduced to clichéd glances and facial twitches. The same holds true for Atonement, but there's the cliché of young love interrupted laid on top of all that. Since the older sister's beau had been at Cambridge for four years, and she'd kept her distance until their last summer together, any love they had was largely a fantasy about the ideals of love. Knowing the low percentage of young love that survives, I didn't believe that a woman in her early 20's in the late 1930's would carry a torch for five years while separated from her similarly-aged lover. Conversely, I couldn't believe that she didn't beat her sister within an inch of her life to make her recant her false testimony.<br/><br/>Even if I had believed it, there wasn't enough character development to make me care. If the movie had covered the fracturing of the family as the result of the elder sister's estrangement, then death, or if it had covered the wrongly-convicted young man's time in prison, then there would be the basis for investing myself in the fate of the two young lovebirds. But just seeing them pine in their minds for each other, holding on to the ideal of their lover to sustain them thousands of miles apart, didn't move me.<br/><br/>The so-called ""atonement"" of the younger sister rang false, striking me as a selfish, public catharsis rather than a true repentance. In fact, in modern parlance, the younger sister displayed traits of a borderline personality, not caring about the impact her actions have on others. Nearly drowning herself at the edge of a waterfall to see if the object of her crush would rescue her, without considering his safety, is not the sign of a caring child. She was old enough and smart enough to realize that her false testimony would wrongly send a man to jail, but she didn't recant. Her storytelling couldn't possibly heal any wounds at the late date she wrote it, and her life as a writer did nothing to make up for her self-serving actions as a young girl. I doubt such a person could realize that there was anything she did that required atonement.<br/><br/>Further adding to the clichés is the score. I dislike movie music that overtly tries to tell me what to feel at any given moment, and the rat-a-tat-tat of the typewriter and surging strings at key moments were intrusively obvious."

","I have found Atonement somewhat disappointing. Even though I have not read Ian McEwan's novel, it is rather obvious that only a great novel could inspire such a good story and the story is by far the best what this movie has. Acting is distant second best and the rest is only fair. Apparently the main problem is that the director Joe Wright has little clue about how to make a psychological drama and with amazing persistence treats this genre as an action movie or a thriller. After the first 15 minutes I became so annoyed and tired with an endless stream of fast-pacing flash-and-go scenes that I was really looking forward to a commercial break. And -- surprise! -- the commercial break came up, although a little late. It happened when Cecilia (Keira Knightley) was leaving on a bus, with Robbie (James McAvoy) running after her. The back of the bus had a large slogan painted across: ""Have a Guinness when you are tired"". It looked just perfect beside beautiful Keira Knightley, indeed. To summarize, it would be unfair to say that the film has totally ruined the story; however, it leaves an impression that its creators perhaps needed a bit more Guinness."

"okrim37","7","4","9","23 September 2007"," The Go-Between meets The English Patient
","It's easy to imagine that many people at Working Title were very excited when they decided to put ATONEMENT in production, since they could be aware that with its mixture of love and death and with its setting during the second world war that could be the right occasion to achieve a sort of new English PATIENT. But since the movie is based upon Ian McEwan's masterpiece, the final result established itself as something different and, in some ways, more interesting, without being necessarily a better movie than Minghella's one. Directed by Joe Wright,in his sophomore effort after the critically acclaimed Pride & Prejudice (but actually in his resume you can find a lot of TV works),the movie is written by Christopher Hampton and it's quite faithful to its source material (as typical by Hampton). So everyone who read the Booker Prize finalist novel knows that the movie can be ideally distinguished in two parts (and a resolutive epilogue set many years after). The first part tells the chronicle of a special day of the summer 1935 during which the lives of the main protagonists are branded. Briony Tallis (played by the extraordinary newcomer Saoirse Ronan), the younger daughter of a rich family, is a child with a vivid imagination; she dreams to become a writer but she's having also her first crush. The ""object of her desire"" is Robbie Turner (the promising and charismatic James McAvoy), a young man, whose mother is one of the family servants. Tallis family paid the college for Robbie and he's also a good friend of Briony's older siblings. Actually Briony doesn't know that Robbie and her sister Cecilia (the always ravishing Keira Knightley, very convincing in her first adult role, it's hard to forget her, especially when she wears that green dress...) are in love therefore when she sees something from the window of her bedroom, she misunderstands and when Robbie ask her to deliver a letter (and besides a wrong one) to Cecilia, she can't stop from reading it and so...as you can see you can find reminiscences from THE GO-BETWEEN, even if Briony is more unreliable than the young boy in that film. But you can see the influence of Losey's classic (which was written by the future Nobel Prize winner Harold Pinter) even more in the atmosphere and in the choice to handle the time. Briony accuses Robbie of a crime he didn't commit, even without any proofs, everybody (except the loving Cecilia) believe her and Robbie finishes in prison. This part is the more particular even if at the beginning the description of the house and the dynamics of the characters could appear a little bit boring. But while the drama is erupting, the tension raises notably, thanks also to the music score by the talented Dario Marianelli (who received an Oscar nomination thanks to PRIDE & PREJUDICE and it won't be so shocking if he'll have another one for this new collaboration with Wright). The second part is set 4 years later, during the war. Cecilia is estranged by her family, she's a nurse now and she's still in love with Robbie who is a soldier and he's in mission in France, where he also witnesses the evacuation of Dunkerque. In the meantime Briony (now played by Romola Garai, whose perf is quite weaker than Ronan's and also than Vanessa Redgrave's who replaces her in the epilogue) has grown up, she still wants to become a writer but she also has understood her mistakes, so she is intentioned to atone them: just like her sister she's working as a nurse, she wants to meet Cecilia and Robbie to tell them she's sorry and that she is going to to exculpate the young man from the charge, even if it won't be so easy...in this part the material becomes more ebullient, but Wright is quite apt to manage it, even when he's tempted by the virtuosity (for example the Dunkerque sequence, shown in a long take). Briony accomplishes her atonement just at the end of her life, after to have become a writer, in a way it could be wrong to bring forward... Quite ambitious in its seemingly realistic system (in this context the first part is superior, because more surprising), the movie is rather satisfying even because the director didn't choose to direct his attention on the more agreeable components (the doom of the two lovers, Cecilia's devotion), showing he doesn't look for the simpler solutions. Let's hope that also in his future films Wright keep this will to risk, and maybe tomorrow we could see his filmography with astonished admiration."

","I did not like this film, nor did I dislike it. It simply vegetated in that uncomfortable state of triviality that is not caring.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that the acting in this film is quite good, and they really managed to pull off the different ages of the characters. The idea of using a typewriter as music really appealed to me.<br/><br/>On the negative side, however, I was appalled by the way this film reinforced stereotypes. Once again, the rape victim lies, the man is innocent, and the whole movie revolves around the fact that he did not rape the girl. Having said that, I was disappointed that the film did not go into any detail at all on the court case, as I for one feel it unlikely that any court would convict purely on the evidence of a teenage girl. Also, the movie did not really have too much of a story to tell, and I left the cinema with a distinct feeling of ""So what?"".<br/><br/>On the whole, this film is not very good, nor is it so abysmal that you can enjoy how terrible it is. It is merely unspectacular, and that, to me, is the most annoying kind of movie."

A quarter of the film is devoted to showing us Robbie on the front, alternating with souvenirs and flashbacks.<br/><br/>Then, comes the last part punctuated with an absurd twist that discredits the scenario, not to mention the incredibly useless last scene.<br/><br/>Atonement therefore clearly lacks coherence and the association of those three parts turns out to be extremely lopsided.

If that was the only affront to the viewer it wouldn't have been so bad but the film is full of episodes that were just simply unbelievable. To give one example dozens of casualties from the evacuation of Dunquerque suddenly turn up at a hospital in London without any warning: no telephones or radio in 1940?

","*Spoilers* This story begins in 1935 in a British manor house where we soon meet the three main characters: Briony, a precocious thirteen year old; Cecilia, Briony's elegant older sister; and Robbie, the handsome son of a housemaid. The main themes are set up early on. Cecilia and Robie become romantically involved and Briony's initial jealousy turns into vindictiveness based on some misinterpretations. Toward the end of the story in 1940 we have Robbie in France waiting to be evacuated from Dunkirk. In the interim between 1935 and 1940 Robbie has spent time in jail, due to a lie put forth by Briony--he had been released in order to fight in the war. In 1940 Briony is a nurse who is preoccupied with atoning for her lie and Cecilia, also a nurse, pines for Robbie's return.<br/><br/>The period details are well done. The London street scenes seem realistic (""Have a Guiness when you're tired"" poster on a London double-decker), the costumes are sumptuous, and the cinematography lavish. The original score by Dario Marianelli is effective and plays a significant role.<br/><br/>I could not stay involved since so many scenes did not ring true. I started to have troubles when Cecilia took off her dress and jumped into the fountain--would she have dared do that in plain view? And how would she explain her soaked dress? There is a major problem with Robbie's letter of apology mix-up. We see Robbie crumpling several false starts with his letter, then, rather than crumpling a highly volatile one, he folds it and places it on his desk. He leaves his final version fully exposed on his desk while putting the salacious one in the envelope. Are we really to believe that? If you were to commit such highly sensitive thoughts to paper (a doubtful endeavor in itself), would you not be damned careful that that paper never see the light of day? Robbie gives his letter to Briony for her to deliver; how convenient for the plot, but how hard to believe. Then there are the scenes with the search for the missing boys. Can we be expected to believe that a prosperous businessman would attempt rape while fully aware that a search party was at large in the area? Would Robbie and Cecilia have had sex in the library in such close proximity to the others in the house? They at least closed the door, but then Briony was able to simply push her way in to catch them. Would Cecilia and Robbie's brief attachment have been able to sustain their love for five years while apart? I think such love happens only in romantic movies and novels.<br/><br/>The recreation of the retreat from Dunkirk was clearly a considerable undertaking, but the main effect it had on me was to want to do some research as to what the actual historical situation was. This presentation with group sings, carnival rides, drunken bar scenes, and a large-screen cinema seemed too strange to be true. And, unless you have some knowledge of history, the Dunkirk scenes could be confusing. Why were soldiers killing horses and disabling vehicles?<br/><br/>Some scenes come out of nowhere without advancing the plot. For example, I could not see what the scene that had Briony tending a wounded French soldier had to do with anything. The horrors of the wounded had already been amply displayed, as well as Briony's empathetic reactions.<br/><br/>At the very end there is an interview with an old Briony, played by Vanessa Redgrave. I was able to appreciate Redgrave's outstanding performance, but I have problems with dramas that lead us down a certain path only to pull the rug out from under us at the end."

The screenplay was wonderful to start with, but the last part's narrative did lose its way a little, and despite the fact that I thought Briony's portrayal was fine on the most part, when she first finds that Lola is being hurt by who she suspects is Robbie, I didn't find her as comforting as she was in the book. The library scene I thought was more believable in the book, it just felt thrown in in the film. I will say, the performances were wonderful, with Kiera Knightly at her loveliest and James McAvoy very handsome and heroic as the two lovers who embark on a complex love relationship. Also worth of note are the performances of two great actresses, Vanessa Redgrave and Harriet Walter, who didn't disappoint here.

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS.<br/><br/>There is little I can add to the myriad critics and viewers who have seen this beautifully rendered work of art from the novel by Ian McEwan. But I want to point to the commanding performance by Vanessa Redgrave at the end in which she tells us what has happened. She absolutely commands the screen and engages us in such a direct way that we are enthralled and touched. From an artistic point of view it is interesting that the words she speaks need no embellishment or any acting out. There are so perfect and her delivery is beyond professional. It is lived, as is the case with all great acting.<br/><br/>I also was very much taken with the performance of Romola Garai who played Briony at 18. Her face conveyed more than words can tell. She felt so deeply not just her character's great sin, but the tragedy of the war and the dying she saw all around her and the sense that she could not be forgiven. Saoirse Ronan, who played Briony as a girl had a hard edge, almost an evil edge to her that was perfect for the part, a kind of ""bad seed"" depiction with her washed out face and small self-importance and her inability to not just understand what she saw and experienced, but her inability to understand herself and to love instead of desiring only to be loved.<br/><br/>The way the story is presented with scenes out of chronological order but in psychological and emotional order was most effective. I was especially impressed with the idea of showing us the scene where Briony pretends to drown and is saved by Robbie after the fact of the great lie she tells. As presented we immediately understand why she lied. His anger and failure to understand her childish love for him perhaps worked like the Achilles heel of his character. Had he been able to love her as one might love a child and help her to understand that he could not love her otherwise, everything might have been different. Or perhaps not. In a sense hers was an act of atonement, although not in a positive sense.<br/><br/>The epic scenes of the beginning of World War II with the British in retreat and all the bloodshed and waste of war magnified and accentuated, especially the scene with Briony and the dying French soldier Luc, made us understand the how precious life was for those who witnessed this while serving as a dramatic and psychological foil for the love and life that Cecilia and Robbie could not experience.<br/><br/>I also like the economy with which the essential details of the story were presented. We see the dramatic scenes and then we understand with just a few words or even a look what actually happened. For example when Briony as a nurse attends the wedding of Lola and Paul and as the bride and groom walk away we see the shame in their faces, the same shame that Briony feels, only they are not going to own up to it, we know. And then there is the quick flashback to the scene that Briony as a girl had witnessed and this time her mind allows her to see the man's face. And then a bit later on in the scene that the author inside the author (Briony) makes up, we understand that there will be no revelation of the truth because a spouse cannot testify against a spouse, or at least in this case would not.<br/><br/>And then there is the brilliant ending with Vanessa Redgrave summing it up and tying it all together--but more than that, showing us how Briony grew as she went from childhood to old age. In fact the emotional and human transformation that takes place in Briony's character is perhaps the central point of the story. I haven't read the novel by Ian McEwan but I am familiar with his work and know he must have been responsible for such a psychologically compelling development and ending--although it is obvious that the script by Christopher Hampton and the direction by Joe Wright are more than first rate."

God, I wanted to slap her! While the acting was good, the film was morose, gray, depressing and disjointed. The way they went back and forth into the past was very distracting.<br/><br/>The scene that sets up the story is when Briony jumps in the pond so Robbie will have to 'save' her and be her hero. When he berates her for being such a twit and endangering them both - I think that is when she decides to get even. Maybe not even consciously. But it is all her jealousy. As smart as this girl is, I don't think she was confused at all at what she saw and what she decided to do with the knowledge. The older Briony is still trying to use innocence as an excuse.<br/><br/>The Dunkirk withdrawal is another confusing part - war is a mess - but for the audience, we at least should be given a clue to what the objective is. All we see is men going to and fro - to what end. Maybe I missed the dialog, but I was using subtitles - so don't think I missed it if it was there.<br/><br/>Acting honors for me go to the older Briony. McAvoy and Knightly were okay but nothing out of the ordinary. Young Briony was too deadpan. No expression. Maybe that is what the director wanted, but it was not effective.

Recently I watched the first 20 minutes or so and was immediately put off by the atmosphere and the characters (""I've been going completely doolally up here!""), for exactly the same reason that I am generally put off by books like The Great Gatsby or Faulkner's The Sun Also Rises, which feature characters of such wealth that their biggest problem seems to be what to do with all their surplus money and leisure time. Such people are difficult for me to relate to. <br/><br/>For a couple weeks I put the movie aside and couldn't get up the interest to watch it, until finally I did and now I realize why it was one of the best pictures of 2007. Keira Knightly, a clearly talented actor who, for some reason, almost never impresses me, plays the daughter from a wealthy family living in the beautiful English countryside just before World War II, and James MacEvoy plays the daughter of a man working for her family. He is a promising and educated young man, but the son of a housekeeper nonetheless, so clearly a romantic relationship between the two would be highly taboo.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes or so of the movie depict a life devoid of trouble or worries, and yet still manages to create an atmosphere of slight tension about the war that we can almost feel approaching somewhere beyond the edge of the screen. Before long, Cecilia's (Knightly) 13- year-old sister sees a couple of things happening and makes some dangerous assumptions followed by some increasingly dangerous accusations, and radically alters the lives of her sister, Robbie (MacEvoy), and herself.<br/><br/>The three main characters, from this point on, have remarkably little control over their own lives, reminding me of the struggles of the main character in Kubrick's brilliant film Barry Lyndon. The unusually structure of the film allows us to explore the results of a few catastrophic days in the lives of these three people and how they affected the rest of their lives. <br/><br/>The film covers the course of many decades, tells a stunning and moving story, and never once comes off as pretentious or cheesy or preachy, even in the closing scene, which shows Briony, Cecilia's sister, as an aged novelist giving an interview about how that one decision during her childhood has affected her life. This is a story about life and how we affect those around us, particularly those closest to us, even when we think we're doing the best thing for them. One IMDb reviewer calls it ""pure poetry on film,"" and it's not easy to think of a more accurate description.<br/><br/>Note: There is a scene in the film where Robbie comes across a horribly grisly scene in the woods during his military service. The following close-up of his face is one of the best pieces of acting I have seen in many years..."

","Other than the lush scenery and ingenious photography, I see no specialness in this film. Set in pre-World War II England, the story is about a girl bearing false witness and how pettiness can ruin the lives of many. The plot is revealed in stages, showing sequences through the eyes of one character, then another, divulging important facts in the second viewing. At times, the vignettes play out of chronological order so that the audience is deliberately in the dark as to when the events are taking place. I enjoyed this technique and it does add ""punch"" to the overall piece. It seems that the movie is aimed at, and essentially about, the inner life of immature females and their writing and re-writing of scripts in their head. On every level this film feels like a chick film based on a romance novel. I should add at this point that the most shining example of great acting in the film is achieved by Juno Temple as a supporting, but pivotal character named Lola.<br/><br/>I did not feel a strong reason for the two main characters Cecilia (Kneightly) and Robbie (McEvoy) to love each other. Erotic thoughts are inadvertently revealed and suddenly, there is lasting love? It didn't work for me. The ending is supposed to be bittersweet, but I just thought it made the title seem silly. I'm avoiding spoilers here, but the actions taken by Briony offer none of the redemptive qualities of atonement. There are no scenes where she finally grows up and drops her infatuation with her own inner drama. Her attempts to orchestrate lives and feelings in real life as she can on the page, are never tamed. No, I'm afraid this film fell well below expectations for me both as a love story and as a film about Atonement."

","When I first heard about this movie I was kind of in between if I really wanted to watch it or not, and boy am I glad I did. Although I am usually open to watch any movie and give it a fighting chance. Especially a movie that is up for a picture of the year award, then it is almost always a given that I'll watch it. Atonement is honestly up there as my picture of the year (either this or Gone Baby Gone which was poorly misrepresented in the whole award ceremony).<br/><br/>Atonement provides the viewer a completely engaging experience, on multiple different levels. First it sweeps you up with an engaging romance that was completely misinterpreted and misunderstood. Then gives the viewer a look on both sides of the fence. Seeing the young man go off to war away from his love and how they both coped with being apart from one another. And more importantly the grown up little girl who separated the two young lovers and how she was dealing with the mistake that she had made. I like the presentation, I like the actors, and I just flat out like this movie. Most movies I watch (I do work at a Blockbuster) just seem to drag and I'm always watching the clock to when it will be over (Michael Clayton, No Country For Old Men, We Own the Night, and I could keep going) instead of watching the movie itself. But Atonement was a complete experience that I never lost interest in and was actually disappointed that it ended. It is a sad ending, I will warn the casual viewer, but don't let that draw you away, it's well worth it in the end.<br/><br/>So guys if you like good movies, watch this one with your girl. You won't be disappointed and you might actually like it."
"Ric-7","10","3","6","22 February 2008"," Glad I knew nothing about it in advance
","This is a romance set in England just prior to and during WW2. This was all I knew about the film before seeing it. I didn't read the novel. I had no real desire to see the film--it was more a matter of a convenient show time rather than being on my must-see list. If you do not know much about the film or novel, please do not read further.<br/><br/>The film begins in a generally conventional way for a British period piece, but then a few events are shown from two different points of view--one which is objective and one which is very subjective. Showing the different points of view have fractured the time line, so in the second half of the film, the shifts in time continue--but is it also a shift from objective to subjective POV's again? <br/><br/>The ending of this film was profoundly moving. I had no idea at all that Vanessa Redgrave was in this film. Her three or four minutes, in extreme close-up, are perfect. Absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>Note what happens to your hopes during this film. The first half of the film ends with Robbie being unjustly arrested and hauled off. In the next scene, several years later, we find Robbie in uniform in France, and so we assume that the injustice has been corrected, otherwise he would be in prison. Then we find that he signed up in order to be released from prison. We then find him meeting Cecelia again, but this was prior to the scene in France. Will the lovers eventually be reunited? The situation at Dunkirk becomes increasingly hopeless. After the rescue from Dunkirk, we are surprised and greatly relieved to find the lovers have been reunited--just what we hoped for.<br/><br/>And then there was the scene with Vanessa Redgrave, set in the present. The hoped-for conclusion was just fiction, and the truth was tragic. But the creation of the fiction, which granted the characters their hopes and wishes, was the only way to correct the injustice which had been done to them. <br/><br/>I saw this film a second time, after knowing its secrets, and I enjoyed it even more. The actors are uniformly excellent. James McAvoy is even better than excellent--notice the scene in the restaurant, when his shame is so great a burden that he does not even presume to look Cecelia in the eye. This is an outstanding film."
"aaronrourke","3","3","6","18 February 2008"," Routine Telemovie
","Why ATONEMENT is getting such a positive response is baffling. This is the kind of third-rate movie you'd see at midday on TV. Director Joe Wright telegraphs plot twists so early that all dramatic impact is crushed, using certain techniques that are heavy-handed and obvious. Keira Knightley offers yet again a one-note performance, leading the new generation of dull, no-personality actors who manage to create a black hole where there should be a character. James McAvoy fairs better, but his character becomes less interesting as you see clearly where he is going to end up. The ending is so predictable and anti-climatic that you feel the director assumes that the audience is stupid, and unless he hits you over the head with a sledgehammer, you will not understand what is trying to be said. This is the kind of film Merchant/Ivory could have done in their sleep, and even their lesser efforts tower over this half-baked, over-rated film that shows that film-making standards certainly have dropped in recent years."

","Wow, I'm not even sure I saw the same movie as most of you. I found it to be blandly directed and almost totally lifeless from beginning to end. Even the much-ballyhooed one-take, which I would normally be a huge fan of, didn't move me or excite me at all. I just followed it mindlessly. I suppose my problem is I didn't buy any of it: I didn't buy the romance, I didn't buy the tragedy, I didn't buy Briony's regret. I actually kinda liked the first third-ish, up until Robby was arrested. It set up the story in an interesting way; it craftily showed Briony's distorted perception, which culminated in her false accusation. But once the story shifts to Robby and the war it just dies. We should have stayed with Briony the whole time, seen her grow up, seen her regret worsen and deepen, seen her ultimate act of atonement as actually meaning something. But instead we're left with some shoddy war scenes, a choppy final act, and a completely unfair and unrealistic ending.<br/><br/>I mean, it's not terrible. I thought Ronan was terrific and the dialogue (at least in that first third) was sharp and witty and enjoyable. But after just having seen TWBB, it just doesn't even compare."

","ATONEMENT has received it's fair share of acclaim and awards over the last few months, but I am sadly not one of it's fans. Granted, the book is one of the most sought-after reads in recent years and was bound to become a contender for the big-screen, but the result doesn't quite pan out as well as it should.<br/><br/>Before I continue, I must stress that Keira Knightley, James McAvoy and Joe Wright are immensely talented individuals who deserve their success and should go onto more success and awards in time, but on this occasion, I have to be honest and say that ATONEMENT is not one of their best works.<br/><br/>Having not read the book, but reliably informed that it is not a straightforward read and plays out a lot of information in the minds of the characters (a think, not tell mentality), factors like this were always going to be a major concern. Irrespective of whether one reads a book or not, when it comes to adapting it for the big-screen, the audience and their impression have to be clear in the mind of the film-makers.<br/><br/>The problem is that there is not enough emotional involvement with the three main characters and I increasingly as the film progressed felt that the movie was stalling. Cecilia and Briony both come across as spoilt socialites and the actual crime is not sufficiently fleshed out to carry the story through. When James McAvoy's character goes off to Dunkirk (in an admittedly spectacular sequence that seems strangely out of place) there is no realisation amongst his fellow soldiers of the crime he has been accused of, bearing in mind that military folk are a bit more uncompromising than some.<br/><br/>Possibly the most galling thing for me was that just at the time when the film seems to get going, the climax of the film then says that the last 20 minutes on screen didn't happen. I felt robbed of it's emotional core and like other films that have done that (THE SIXTH SENSE) this is the biggest sin any film-maker can commit."
"gradyharp","10","3","6","26 January 2008"," Cinematic Splendor: ATONEMENT reaches the standard of the novel
","For those who have had the immense pleasure of reading Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT not once but several times, basking in not only the brilliant story/mystery but also in the inordinately beautiful language, rest assured that the film not only does the book justice in the transference to the screen, but in the hands of screenplay writer Christopher Hampton (we know that McEwan approved of the modifications as McEwan is one of the producers of the film) becomes even more clear in its realization of the complex plot and finds the visual beauty inherent in McEwan's prose. Joe Wright as director steers this story well, finding just the right amount of back and forth nonlinear development that formed the magic of McEwan's initial weaving.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly superb. From the initial self-centered liar Briony Tallis (an impressive Saoirse Ronan) to the years' later sorrowfully guilty young nurse Briony (Romola Garai) to the 'epilogue' Briony of Vanessa Redgrave, the entire story is adroitly centered on this perpetrator of tragedy. But without the power of James McAvoy's falsely accused Robby Turner and Keira Knightley's tragic Cecilia Tallis the triad would not work. Even the smaller yet important roles assigned to Gina McGee, Brenda Blethyn, Jérémie Renier and countless others are played to perfection.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey captures not only the misty tranquility of 1935 pre-war England complete with creative use of luminous light sources as well as the raw brutality of the battlefields as England enters WW II. Dario Marianelli's music score (much of it played by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet!) incorporates the superb Sir Thomas Beecham recording of 'La Boheme' with de los Angeles and Björling as incidental music to the typing of Robby's fateful note and then proceeds to incorporate the typewriter as if it were an instrument in his orchestrations.<br/><br/>Rarely has this viewer been so moved by a film (and perhaps that may have been related to just having heard a performance of Britten's WAR REQUIEM at the Los Angeles Philharmonic the previous night!): it is the perfect marriage of novel, cinematic realization and commitment on the part of all concerned in the creation of this superlative film. Highly Recommended on every level. Grady Harp"
"allezricht","4","3","6","21 January 2008"," dumbed down version of a potentially epic movie - no way an Oscar winner
","The fundamental problem with the film was the way it dumbed down the story. Eg, we are shown scenes twice to show that two different people have seen what happened, when there is no difference between the scenes. It is almost like the director does not trust the viewer to be intelligent enough to know what is going on and so has to spoon feed you each point.<br/><br/>Certain elements of the plot - in fact the key motif of the film, are massively over-laboured and repeated again and again, like some kind of advertising campaign. In fact parts of the film felt like a perfume ad.<br/><br/>Other large segments of the film are pointless and lend nothing to the plot, drama or tension. In effect, the story is a one-trick pony, but is elongated and complicated to make a longer film. But then to make up for this failure the director/editors have overly expanded dead scenes and repeated obvious dramatic points. To me this is a failed attempt to recreate the drama of The English Patient. But it does not work, unless perhaps the audience is so used to ads they like this kind of film-making."

"Buddy-51","10","3","6","14 January 2008"," a rave review from someone who DIDN'T like the novel
","""Atonement"" turns out to be a much better movie than it is a book. But before I explain what I mean by that, a little background on the story may be in order.<br/><br/>Ian McEwan's novel - which spans eight decades, from the 1930's to the present day - centers around Briony Tallis, a precocious 13-year-old who lives with her family on a country estate in England. Briony is an imaginative child who revels in a world of fantasy and make-believe, a writer of stories and plays who is actually less equipped to interpret the realities of the adult world than she gives herself credit for. One unusually hot summer day in 1935, Briony witnesses a series of events involving her older sister, Cecilia, and the caretaker's son, Robbie, that her child's mind misinterprets in a way that leads to tragic consequences for all involved. Her choosing to act on what she believes to be true winds up echoing down the corridors of time, through World War II and beyond. As time passes and Briony grows to adulthood, she comes to see the error of her ways and spends the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for what she has done. The coup de grace is that, due to circumstances beyond her control, Briony is forced to achieve her redemption in the only way she knows how - as a writer.<br/><br/>At the risk of offending devotees of the novel, I must confess to being somewhat less than enamored with a book that many seem to rank among their all-time favorites. For despite its sometimes impressive dreamlike quality, the novel is too contrived and self-conscious to make the reader anything more than a mere dispassionate observer of the events it is portraying. As a writer, McEwan has an undeniable flair for narrative voice and description, but it frequently comes at the expense of characterization and story. His plotting is often arbitrary and clumsy, and his dialogue, when indeed he deigns to use any, is almost always stilted and unconvincing (I have to admit to laughing and rolling my eyes when I was reading the crucial letter-swapping scene).<br/><br/>Yet, something has gone terribly right with the material in its journey from the printed page to the silver screen (suffice it to say, I didn't roll my eyes this time around). Since film is a largely visual medium, screenwriter Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright are able to convey through images what it takes McEwan endless reams of paper to get across. Here, an idea can be suggested through a simple shrug of the shoulders, a meaningful turn of the head, a barely noticeable gesture or wave of the hand. And, indeed, the movie is rich in beautiful and unforgettable images that evoke a feeling, a time, a place, sometimes even an entire theme, all on their own. Even though the screenplay remains faithful to the three-act structure of the piece, that structure comes across as less fragmented, less arbitrary and less self-conscious than it does in the novel. Thanks to the seamless fluidity of Seamus McGarvey's stunning cinematography and the unifying tones of Dario Marianelli's brilliant musical score, everything in the film version of ""Atonement"" feels perfectly integrated and all of a piece.<br/><br/>Of the performers, only Keira Knightley is in any way problematic. She looks positively gorgeous as the seductive Cecilia, and there are moments when she achieves the proper mixture of tenderness and haughtiness essential to the character. But she has a tendency to spit out her lines in a much too rapid fashion and her tight-lipped poutiness (a problem, too, in ""Pride and Prejudice"") eventually becomes annoying and distracting. As Robbie, James McAvoy proves again why he is one of his generation's most exciting screen talents, while young Saoirse Ronan is remarkably poignant and poised as the 13-year-old Briony. Ramola Garai and veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave do nicely as Briony in later stages of her life (although the ending, while moving, is a bit more reminiscent of ""Titanic"" than it needs to be).<br/><br/>Wright is often at his best when turning what could have been mere technical ""stunts"" into integral pieces of the drama: a beautifully realized, five-and-a-half-minute long tracking shot of the carnage at Dunkirk, the effortless incorporation of a clicking typewriter into the musical score, a row of nurses marching in time to the rhythmic clacking. Through sight and sound, Wright creates a surrealistic, dreamlike tone, perfectly appropriate to the material at hand. What's amazing is that, even with all these stylistic flourishes, Wright never loses sight of the human drama at the story's core. In his direction, he displays an astonishing economy of means, moving the story along at an almost breakneck speed yet never allowing the movie to feel telescoped or rushed. Not only does his pacing not sacrifice the emotional resonance of the piece; it greatly enhances it.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" ends on a lyrical note of melancholic uplift that leaves audiences wrung out and emotionally exhausted, as Briony engages in her final and greatest act of storytelling creativity. Watching the movie ""Atonement"" is nothing short of a rapturous experience."
"kystilla","10","3","6","11 January 2008"," Probably the best movie ever
","The title may sound a bit pretentious or exaggerating but I can say a definite 'yes' when I'm asked if ""Atonement"" was a good movie. It was a phenomenal one. <br/><br/>When I first read the book, I thought that it is impossible to convert the idea of the book into a film. In my opinion, there are certain books that are hard or impossible to adapt into a screenplay but I must say that Joe Wright has managed to do that in a very elegant matter. <br/><br/>Elegant is probably the best word to describe this movie. There is a kind of soft flow to the movie; it isn't too fast nor is it boringly slow. It is the tempo I have seen before with ""Virgin Suicides"" and it is the perfect tempo for ""Atonement"" as well. <br/><br/>This is the first movie where Keira Knightley (Cecilia Tallis) comes out of her usual role as a young beautiful girl who just ""is"" and becomes a young woman whose depiction of the character is brilliant. We see for the first time that Ms. Knightley is not just a pretty face but she has the potential of becoming a great drama actress. <br/><br/>James McAvoy (Robbie Turner) is of course charming as all the ladies will agree but he also goes deep into the character of Robbie Turner. He conveys Robbie's pain and anguish as if they were his own and makes us all believe that his love for Keira/Cecilia is real. <br/><br/>Saoirse Ronan is plausible as a the young Briony Tallis and Romola Garai's plea for forgiveness makes us want to forgive her but does not let us forget that her guilt runs deep. In my eyes, Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal as an old and weakening Briony is better than that of Ms. Ronan or Ms. Garai. Mrs. Redgrave knows what to say when and what emotions to reveal on her face. Briony's final act is what brings tears in my eyes. <br/><br/>Being an avid moviegoer, I must admit that ""Atonement"" is the first movie over years that has managed to maintain the essence of the book but still stays unique and is not simply an adaption. And I think it doesn't hurt to say once more that ""Atonement"" deserves an Oscar."

"dbogosian-1","5","3","6","7 January 2008"," Doesn't live up to the hype
","I was prepared to love ""Atonement,"" but I came away very disappointed. The film failed in two basic ways: 1) None of the characters were intrinsically likable or endearing. The only one I felt any sympathy for was the 18-year old Briony, because she was truly suffering and could find no way out. But neither of the two protagonists grabbed me in any way. Their love was never made credible or plausible, we never got to see any of the reasons why Keira's character would fall in love with that guy, aside perhaps from the hot weather and the dreariness of the other available men. But that's hardly enough to keep her love at white-hot pitch for years afterwards.<br/><br/>2) So many of the key incidents are so utterly improbable, that one cannot take the plot seriously at all. Take the incident with the flower vase: they live in this huge mansion, they're obviously filthy rich, and the girl is distraught over breaking one silly ceramic piece? And even if she was, wouldn't she just call a servant to go dredge up the broken piece, rather than diving into the water herself? Or sending a 13-year old out in the dark, alone, to search for the missing twins; who would ever do that? If this were more of a fantasy story, I'd be more accommodating, but this was clearly presented as gritty reality.<br/><br/>The film-making is good, but even that had some annoying qualities. It seemed like so many shots were close-ups, I felt nauseatingly oppressed by the sheer size of the images. The whole typewriter-as-percussion-instrument idea was cute the first time, but it lost its novelty after about the third instance. The first portion of the movie reminded me a lot of a Poirot episode, except without the grace and charm. The English are all snobs, upper crust with genteel manners but horrible people at the core, and there is no one of any value you can cling to. The Dunkirk scenes were quite impressive, and the reality of nursing life during the war was equally intense.<br/><br/>And I have to say, of all Keira's major roles thus far, this is easily her least likable. Maybe it's all that smoking, you almost feel like coughing by the end."
"cinemaniac2002","10","3","6","6 January 2008"," A stunning cinematic adaptation and achievement-Spoilers?
","Atonement was adapted from Ian McEwan's book, by screenwriter Christopher Hampton. Director Joe Wright's previous work includes Pride and Prejudice. In an article in Creative Screen writing magazine, it is explained why it is so evident that the film has been well-received: it was decided to stay as close to the original story as possible.<br/><br/>We've all heard the phrase ""The book was better,"" uttered by so many people, that it is pretty well expected to hear that in connection with film adaptation. However, it is rare that anyone dares to say that a film is actually better than the book version of the story.<br/><br/>With Keira Knightley and James McAvoy in the leads, including a near-surprise appearance by Vanessa Redgrave, it is difficult to find any fault with the cast. In particular, despite her physical frailty, Ms. Knightley remains an emotional force to reckon with.<br/><br/>The opening scenes of Atonement, are more than effective at setting the stage for controversy, even surprisingly so. It is doubtful that most of the audience members, unless they had read the book first, were prepared for the gravity of the in-your-face brashness of the first act.<br/><br/>Taking place in 1935, as the world is on the brink of war, the story begins with families who have managed to still enjoy the sort of serenity reserved by the wealthy, in the isolated remoteness of the English countryside. But all is not as it seems, as is usually the case. Every family has its own drama, and the Tallises are no different. As 13-year old Briony (Saoirse Ronan, later played by Romola Garai), a budding writer who has already penned a play, bears witness to older sister, Cecilia (Kiera Knightley)'s coming of age, she displays the inevitable combination of envy, mixed with a potent anxiety, over Cecilia's hot, quick and heady entanglement with servant, Robbie (James McAvoy).<br/><br/>While the film is a period piece, it is important that this doesn't dissuade anyone who is not usually partial to such types of films: it is simply unfair to relegate this movie to the unfortunate and derogatory ""chick flick"" status. It is truly so much more than that, romance aside. McEwan is most certainly, no Emily Bronte or Jane Austen. This film, marketed as a romance, is actually more about the importance of truth, and how the lack thereof can destroy lives, most importantly, the life of the liar, who must live the resultant life sentence of sadness and pity.<br/><br/>The film, just as the book does, possesses sharply distributed dialog and character interaction, which strongly emphasizes the gravity of the story. The story's urgency is paralleled and very much affected by the wartime depictions of Britain and Northern France.<br/><br/>The method that Wright embraces to enhance the cinematic nature of the story, includes shows events twice, from both Briony's eyes and a more neutral, honest perspective, which is effective at explaining how a young girl's impressions can mistakenly convince her to actually believe against what is really occurring.<br/><br/>While Keira Knightley does issue a fantastic performance, the star billing she receives does not match the importance of Briony, played by three actresses: Saorise Ronan as a 13-year old, Romola Garai as an 18-year old, and the amazing Vanessa Redgrave as an older woman.<br/><br/>Thematically, Atonement is tragic, whether its story is told in book or cinematic form. The film, augmented by its dramatic music score, by necessity, is far faster paced than the book. As Woody Allen uses the city of New York as a character in his stories, this film used a typewriter, which, as an instrument, manages to successfully remind one that there is a very serious story being told.<br/><br/>All in all, Atonement is as finely crafted and visually stunning as a film can get, and its pace is every bit as good as any thriller, including its emotional, gut-wrenching surprise ending.<br/><br/>© 2008 Susan S.

"MichaelMargetis","10","3","6","29 December 2007"," One of the Best Period Pieces I've Seen
","Cecilia Tallis: I love you. I'll wait for you. Come back. Come back to me. <br/><br/>Sweeping, Involving, Well-Acted, Masterfully Directed, Entertaining, Long and Extremely Dramatic. Exactly the way I like my epics. Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, but certainly not one about romance between two teenage lovers. Usually I'm not a big fan of the period piece genre, especially the ""romantic"" period piece genre. In 1996, a romantic period piece won best picture. Despite it's immense critical acclaim, one of the most boring films I've ever seen was 'The English Patient'. As I sat there on my couch watching I almost began crying because I thought this cruel form of punishment in the form of a DVD would never end. Of course, I could have taken the DVD out of the player, but I always complete a movie once I start it no matter how bad it is. However, I'm not reviewing 'The English Patient', I'm reviewing 'Atonement'. So walking into 'Atonement', I wasn't expecting something I'd be too excited to recommend to people. But, after those ending credits started to roll I was absolutely shocked at how brilliant the piece of film-making was I had just witnessed for the last two hours. 'Atonement' is perhaps the best romantic period piece ever made and without question one of 2007's very best films. <br/><br/>On the outside, 'Atonement' may seem like something Jane Austen would write. However, it is not. First of all it's too rough around the edges and secondly it's far better than anything she wrote. It's not a sappy, unrealistic, ""feel-good"" movie but a hard-hitting, painfully realistic and uncompromising masterpiece of a motion picture. The story takes place in 1935 England, when the country is just on the cusp of World War II. There's a rich family plantation owned by Tallis family. Cecilia Tallis (Keiria Knightley) is the good-looking and desirable late-teens rich girl who the not-so-simple clean-cut farm boy Robby (James MacAvoy) falls in love with. One day, Cecilia's younger sister Briony (Sairose Ronan) witnesses Cecilia and Robby physically expressing their love for each other what the twelve year old understandably mistakes for forced sexual violence upon her sister. When Robby mistakenly gives Briony a letter addressed to Cecilia explaining how Robby would like to taste Cecilia's nether regions and there is an ""incident"" in the house, Briony comes forward and indicates Robby as a sexual predator. Robby gets arrested and sent away never to see his love Cecilia again. The story then shifts a couple of years later in 1939 where Robby is a soldier in the war and Cecilia a nurse. That's about all I'll tell you about the plot. <br/><br/>The biggest achievement of 'Atonement' is perhaps while the film isn't always fast-paced, it's never boring. This is due partly because of the exquisite acting. James MacAvoy who has usually been upstaged by other actors in his previous films (cough, cough, Last King of Scotland, cough, cough), finally gets his moment shine and he's brilliant in his performance. Keira Knightley is great as well in a small part, but the best performances come from the three actresses who play Briony. Vanessa Redgrave is remarkable in her five minutes on screen and Romola Garai is extremely powerful as Briony at age 18. The best of these three is 12-year-old Saoirse Ronan as the 13-year-old Briony. She's absolutely incredible if not creepy in her role that will no doubt be remembered at Oscar time. Joe Wright's directing and the film's cinematography is without question some of the finest of 2007, and Christopher Hampton's screenplay is outstanding. <br/><br/>There's really nothing I have to complain about 'Atonement'. It may not take the #1 slot on my top 10 list of 2007, but it will be there around #2 or #3. 'Atonement' is not only one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of seeing this year, but it's also one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of seeing ever. Grade: A"
"findingmills","9","3","6","29 December 2007"," One of the best picture of this year!
","Since I have wathced ""Pride and Prejudice"",I fell in love with Keira Knightly. So, as long as her movie is on show, I will watched it without any doubt. ""Atonemnet"" is included,too. Sorry for my pool English, I can not find a exact word to describe such an amazing movie. Maybe ""fantastic"",or maybe ""marvelous"". I just wanna say that ""Atonement"" will be surly nominated by the Academy Award,because of its unforgettable storyline and the fabulous acting. I say from my heart that I have deeply touched by this story. It reminds me of the same category movie ""Coldmoutain"", which told us a story about love in the war. I think in some way that ""Atonemont"" is a little bit similar with ""Coldmoutain"". But it is more successful than that Anthony Minghella movie,which means that ""Atonement"" has that kind of power to make you cry, especially the sense that Cecilia and Robbie had a chance to gather again,and Briony could make everything right, and later the old Briony told your all of that was only in her book. As I previously mentioned, the performance in this movie is one of the most significant element to make it outstanding. It's nice to see that James McAvoy, a young Britain actor who has charming appearance and talent, gave us a perfect show. His put his passion into every expression of Robbie and every line he said, which made such a complicated role alive. I am pretty sure that James will get a nominee of Oscar. He deserved it. And attention must be paid to Keira Knightly,which the main reason why I watched this movie. She has proved that she is not only a young Britain girl with beauty, but a talented actress with wonderful skill. She gave us another perfect performance by the role ""Cecilia"". But it is still I can not say it definitely that she will get the nominee as a ""Best Actress"". Generally speaking, Cecilia cannot be called the heroic role in this movie. This role is too simple or too easy for Keira."
"Plugger04","6","3","6","28 December 2007"," The whole was less than the sum of the parts
","There is lots to like about this movie. The acting was generally very good, particularly the contained intensity of Brioney. Most of the scenes are well constructed, with the exception of the outdoor shots in wartime London  which are a little awkward have feel staged.<br/><br/>The five-minute one shot sequence at Dunkirk would have been a brilliant achievement in a different type of film where it served a purpose (as in Children of Men). In this one it's out of place, self conscience and makes the audience feel the same.<br/><br/>Overall its an enjoyable film that does draw you in and hold your attentions but it fails to leave any lasting impression. ""What exactly was the point of that"" was my question leaving the cinema."
"azeffer","10","3","6","23 December 2007"," Superb Triumph
","Gripping, heart wrenching, thoughtful, and pieced together brilliantly. Notice the subtle nuances of the filmmaker, how Cecilia's foot slips out of her shoe during the love scene in the library, or the piece of china sinking to the bottom of the fountain. The depiction of war is perhaps one of the most accurate in recent history, bringing the horror to full effect. <br/><br/>This provoking story gives everyone pause to reflect on the fanciful lies that children can tell, and the havoc they rake. <br/><br/>The acting is perfection. Sheer artistry. The chemistry between the two leads lends a great deal to the believability. The scene of their reunion in the tea shop, where Robby moves his hand is so telling.<br/><br/>Bravo to everyone involved."
"flipgirl38","Null","3","6","16 December 2007"," An Artistic, Technical, and Emotional Masterpiece
","Atonement opens on a young Briony Tallis jubilantly finishing a play to be performed that evening for her family. She stands and walks through her home, searching for her mother, and we follow her, ghostlike, looming above, as she searches. In a way, the themes of this film are summed up in this first shot: Briony, aimless, searching for truth in her imagination and fiction. And if this sounds like a contradiction, trust me when I say you will come to understand this by film's end.<br/><br/>I have not read the book, written by Ian McEwan, but after viewing this film, I am eager to pick it up and follow the thoughts of the characters more intimately than what is shown on film. What we have here is amazing work, both technically, artistically, and emotionally, yet on some level, it is unable to grasp the concept of writing fiction from Briony's point of view. There are no doubts about the talents of Joe Wright, who at 34 has now made two exceptional films (Pride and Prejudice being the other one) with his lead actress Keira Knightly, who herself grows in her abilities with each passing year.<br/><br/>James McAvoy cements his position as a leading man, creating a brilliant life in Robbie that glues your eyes to his predicaments and his thought on the world around him. He carries the weight of the film, and is the one who undergoes the most change. From his fresh faced boyishness in the opening scenes to the rugged, worn, and tired eyes in the latter, McAvoy is able to successfully convey the innocence of young love to the brutalities of war, and we love him for it.<br/><br/>Joe Wright has again, proved his talent as a film director, whose use of the tracking shot will be among the greatest, up there with Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Children of Men, and Magnolia. His use with a camera lens is so poetic at times, they could be freeze framed and placed on walls as pieces of art in themselves. My only qualm is sometimes these shots are too technical, and distracts from the film itself. Though that is more of a personal observation than a general one.<br/><br/>And let's not forget to mention the score, which only enhances the epic feel it brings, successfully weaving diegetic noise (the typewriter in particular) with the non-diegetic, Dario Marianelli, composer of Wright's previous work, Pride and Prejudice, creates moody, dramatic pieces that perfectly set the tone of the scenes they play in. It's one that will be recognized in years to come.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Atonement is one of the best films released this year, and certainly a must see for lovers of film in general, if only for its amazing tracking shot of a war torn beach in France. I, for one, look forward to viewing it a second time in the near future."
"hdtwalden68","10","3","6","15 December 2007"," Five Stars! ~ Best Picture~
","Simply put, ATONEMENT is equal in its technical beauty, vision and scope to ""Gone With The Wind"". Joe Wright's vision as the film's Director is the principle reason this movie will attain the greatness it richly deserves. The story and plot would be otherwise lifeless,and of no consequence, taken by itself. The acting, while superb is not extraordinary and is not the reason this film is a MUST SEE. Although Vanessa Redgrave's appearance is so persuasive; it would be easy to forget that she is a superb actress. The Director's vision sets this epic Romance apart. This movie is an extraordinary achievement in it's visual feel and beauty. Film is a visual and emotional experience, simply stated, this movie delivers, and how!"

","I saw Atonement in Seattle yesterday to a packed house. I felt, for two hours I literally could not move. I had been looking forward to the release after reluctantly falling complete in love with Joe Wright's previous movie Pride & Prejudice. He has proved to be an upcoming visionary director who pulls you into stories on a whole other level. But James McAvoy, amazing. His face on screen pulled my heart out and crushed it to the floor of the theater. I felt I needed air when the lights came up, and for a movie buff that is a good feeling. Atonement has the tragic feel of the English Patient with much more likable characters. I can't say enough. Incredible. I hope Oscar sends many well deserved nods its way this year."
"cvantooren","10","3","6","29 November 2007"," Mesmerising...
","I can't praise this film highly enough. Sufficient to say it is cinema at it's very best. Beautifully directed, filmed and acted, in my book it qualifies as a classic already. Keira Knightly, although stunningly beautiful...with the perfect delicate look for the era the film was set in, has failed to impress me with her acting in previous films, but here she captures the essence of Cecilia beautifully. As for James McAvoy - what a star this young Scot is going to turn out to be! His facial expressions alone spoke volumes - and with those beautiful eyes how could any woman fail to fall in love with the lovely Robbie? A subtle yet truly great performance from him - and the rest of the cast were excellent.<br/><br/>If this film doesn't get recognizxed as the Best Picture of the year when the awards ceremonies come around, then I for one will be sorely disappointed."
"Film_fan_angel","9","3","6","1 November 2007"," brilliant film certain to move you
","It is rare that a film in which nothing really happens, can have such a huge impact on the audience. I was really stunned by the cinematography, and the brilliant acting of all the actors.<br/><br/>I went into the film not sure what to expect but came out amazed (and a little depressed!) It's not just a love story, but one of personal reflection and facing up to the consequences of your actions, even if you have to atone for them your whole life.<br/><br/>I think the performance of 13 year old Briony really deserves a mention - it was essential that all 3 Brionys link together seamlessly, to make the film effective. However the young Briony's the first we see of this central character - if she'd been a whiny annoying brat the entire effect would have been lost but she played it so well and it was believable that she didn't simply lie; she was so appalled as to convince herself of Robbie's guilt. A great find.<br/><br/>Aside from that I still can't believe this epic work was only Joe Wright's second, and he's so young. A very talented director who stuck faithfully to the book - which I'm now going to read and compare. He captured the emotions and motives well, leaving no doubt in my mind about each characterisation. The slow tempo only allowed long still shots to emphasise this effect and that 4.5 Dunkirk scene was just breathtaking. Even though it wasn't like the opening in Private Ryan, which was gritty, this almost had a tranquil beauty, which nevertheless showed the realism of war in crystal clarity. The intertwining shots and objects through Robbie's eyes were also placed just right that there was always something to look at.<br/><br/>The uniqueness of this film is that it is not memorable throughout (though it's certainly memorable) but that there are certain scenes, such as the library scene, the Dunkirk scene and the scene where briony goes to see Cecilia, which are so vividly done that they'll always stay in your mind, a long time after the end. A very raw film that has plenty of feeling. Definitely worth seeing, with some patience."

","Being the jaded soul that I am I wanted to hate this film, mostly because everyone else was loving it (does that make me a bad critic?) but you see the thing is I just couldn't dislike it in anyway. It is told so well, edited so cleverly, the music is powerful, the story is multi-layered, there's that six minute tracking shot in the middle which is simply breathtaking (filmed on a set that cost £1 million pounds), all in all it is everything a movie should be. Based on the Ian McEwan novel it tells of how a simply misunderstanding can have disastrous effects and escalate a situation way out of control. With a backdrop of World War 2 the two star crossed lovers, knightly (still wooden) and McAvoy (always brilliant) communicate through letters and long to see each other again but the war and circumstance may have other plans. A real human story packed with emotion and depth it's like a British 'English Patient' and I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't in line for an Oscar or two. At last a film with a brain, enjoy because it will probably be a while before you see another film this good."

","There's a lovely irony at work here inasmuch as the bulk of the action takes place in the thirties/forties, an age when movies were made for the masses rather than a 'target' audience but even a target audience is no longer sufficient so that today movies like this are what I choose to call Festival Fodder, where the director has one eye on the viewfinder and the other on the Golden Palm, Silver Bear, Bronze Ego Massager or whatever and whilst these films are certainly good for one viewing and attract lots of puffery from 'Arts' programmes and Sunday supplements they seldom stand up to a second viewing a few years later (hands up anyone who can sit through The English Patient again). Joe Wright, current critical flavor of the month, has turned out a decent enough movie and some of the trendiest names in the business - Knightley, McAvoy - are on hand to lend gravitas to the project but significantly the best acting by a country mile is contributed by Vanessa Redgrave at the very end of the movie - in another irony the character she plays is very similar to the one played by her father, Michael, in The Go-Between, i.e. youth grown old and bitter and filled with remorse for lives damaged in earlier decades - and as virtually all of it is shot in close up she has only her face, eyes, and voice to work with. Can you stand more irony? You can, swell; in the Dunkirk segment there's a brief clip from the Marcel Carne/Jacques Prevert Quai des Brumes, featuring Michele Morgan and Jean Gabin (this is mistakenly referred to as Recif de Corail by IMDb; Quai des Brumes was released in 1938 whilst Jean Gremillon's Recif de Corail was interrupted by the war and had not been completed by the time of Dunkirk) a far, far superior film than Atonement and one that was made with both the director's eyes on entertaining the masses, come to think of it, Mr. Wright, THAT's how you make classics, by default rather than design."
"mick-137","3","3","7","6 August 2008"," The decadent fag-end of Briitish cinema
","Atonement is a sort of compilation of all the besetting sins of British cinema: the obsession with class and sexual repression, the endless retreat to the past, the fetishistic recreation of ""period"" detail.<br/><br/>The story, such as it is, is about an intense interaction between just three characters. But these lives all but disappear against the backgrounds of teeming London streets, country house vistas and the chaos of Dunkirk. This last scene is both the film's best and worst moment. A triumph in cinematic terms it adds little or nothing to the story and in retrospect is made to look even more of an overblown gesture. Every scene in this movie appears to be aimed at an awards jury--the ordinary viewer can't help feeling a little left out.<br/><br/>The initial conceit of the story--a confused adolescent misinterprets the actions of two adults and ruins their lives--isn't really worked through. Instead the action is driven by a chain of melodramatic and increasingly unlikely coincidences and chance discoveries. Bryony's ""atonement"", when it comes, is at first overdue and inadequate, and ultimately vastly overdue and incredibly inadequate. Her final reduction of everyone, including herself, to mere characters to be manipulated forms a heartless coda to a heartless film.<br/><br/>McAvoy is his usual superb self, but his foil is today's porcelain clothes horse of choice Kiera Knightley, a sort of stretch limo to Helena Bonham Carter's Mini Cooper. Here she who displays her complete acting range, which basically consists of narrow eyes (icy-but-indifferent) and wide eyes (loyal-and-loving). Ultimately Knightley is a metaphor for the whole film: lovely to look at, well put together but devoid of any meaning."
"gremma","5","3","7","6 February 2008"," I did not see what everyone else seemed to see.
","I found ""Atonement"" not to be the same movie everyone is ""ga-ga"" over. I must have missed something that they saw in this movie. Maybe those who read the book had a better understanding of its characters. I thought the beginning of the movie to about maybe half way through was very good. It was filmed so we could see what Broiny (Saoirse Ronan) saw, then what actually happened. The movie flip-flopped in time to accomplish this, it was a bit confusing at first. Once we realize that this is what's happening, you just follow along. Once the situation is out in the open, the movie then asks us to be concerned for its characters, but we don't know them. All we have seen is that the truth has been twisted. All I felt about it was I couldn't believe all the adults believed the child above everyone else. No one asked why she believed as she did, that most was taken out of context. Why wasn't Kiera Knightly's character more influential in stating the true character of ""Robbie"" than a teenager? I didn't know Ceceila (Kiera Knightly) or Robbie (James McAvoy) enough to truly feel anything. We had no idea what the relationship between Ceciela and Broiny was, did they battle each other for attention? Were they jealous of one another? or were they very close? Not enough to involve me. It struck me that Broiny's love for the written word did not propel her to seek to have the ones in the letter better explained to her, to ask if Ceceila was offended by them.<br/><br/>The actors seemed to know their characters even if we did not, and the acting was very good. The cinematography was beautiful, perfect lighting. The clothing looked especially well done, quite to the era. The score was brilliant, inserting the typewriter into the music was very well done. If I had known more about the characters, at least enough to care about them, maybe I would feel more about the movie. I am not a fan of soap opera maybe this is the key ingredient necessary to see the awe everyone else seems to see in this movie. Maybe I went to this movie with expectations.

It's not a film that takes a hold on you even for just a little while. The book pulls you in and includes one of the best descriptions of what it must've been like to work at a hospital during W.W.II that I've ever read. The film is beautiful to look at, and Joe Wright is a capable and gifted director. However there is a sense of detachment that permeates the whole film. James McAvoy, wonderful in ""The Last King of Scotland,"" is stymied by the painterly scenes that don't let their characters be real, breathing people. The music is pleasant but has the effect of just adding to the whole package. The music says ""Now, you must feel this way."" The only thing that is truly worth seeing in this film is Vanessa Redgrave at the end of the film. Sure, the film will get Oscars. It's the kind of film major award-givers love. It's a love story set in the inter-war years that segues into W.W.II. There is a long tracking shot of a battlefield. Who can resist these? But it's all glitter and not much substance. I like the fact that there are filmmakers willing to adapt complex novels into films, and they should continue to do so. However about this film I must say, read the book!!"
"sko_100","9","5","15","8 September 2007"," Another excellent turn from Joe Wright
","Mr Joe Wright, if this directing lark doesn't work out for you, you CLEARLY have a sparkling career as a landscape photographer waiting for you. In a manner similar to his previous British literary adaptation, the infamous 'remake' of Pride and Prejudice, every shot was of such beauty, that for, as has previously been said of Raging Bull, you could take any frame of the film and it would a make a more than sizable photograph, and for my part I'd certainly put it up on my wall. Even the mind-blowingly long tracking shot of war torn Dunkirk beach was simultaneously filled with despair and yet a certain picturesque quality, perhaps intentionally contrasting it between the chocolate box imagery of the seaside and the stark contrast with the current situation. And as ever the sets in this film are so clearly painstakingly set up, the beach shot the most sizable notice of this, which even the harshest of critics could not fail to be impressed by. The first act was, again echoing P&P, almost like a film AND a ode of love to the great English countrysides and stately homes, panning over the trees and charmingly uneven hilltops, even adding a dash of glamour to what appeared to be overgrown weeds.<br/><br/>In newspaper reviews, a couple of critics accused Joe Wright of being style over substance. The style is undeniably there. But I think in order for the film to have stood up as well as it did, there must have been a hefty great deal of substance also. I think the main problem was that the book, I'd imagine, with its to and fro narrative, didn't QUITE translate onto film. Although each section was beautifully crafted in its own way, it did seem to jump to time periods with no prior warning, such that you'd have to later realise what was going on. A minor niggle I know, and it may not annoy anyone else. As previously stated though, each part was expertly navigated by Joe Wright and of course this was also in great part thanks to the actors involved. The three actresses playing Briony were stubborn, numbly guilt-stricken and resigned respectively (the relative newcomer playing 13-year-old Briony is a standout find). James McAvoy again displays why he is so sought after with a sterling performance as a least flawed character in a film filled with imperfect people. Keira Knightley managed to avoid pouting her way through the movie and is again brilliant in her flawed English rose role, making the transition from aloof elitist to lovelorn with perhaps an over-swiftness, but that again may be what the script asked of her. The support cast provided a more than adequate frame, though not given much limelight to work with as the three main protagonists do such a brilliant job. As corny a prospect as it sounds, I think the sets and shooting locations should be credited as an invaluable cast member also, adding an additional emotional facet to every scene appropriately, taking your breath away without taking your eye away from the acting in the foreground.<br/><br/>In short, mature and sensitive directing form Joe Wright (surely a name to look out for); Robbie, Cecilia and Briony x 3 all ever so much more than adequately portrayed; an excellent story from award and kudos-garnering Ian McEwan smartly adapted for screen; mouthwatering cinematography and locations tied up with another star turn from Dario Marianelli, returning for his second Joe Wright collaboration with an flowing and swelling score punctuated, appropriately by typewriter sound effects. All the emotion and beauty of Titanic set on<br/><br/>land, sans boat and Celine Dion. A must-see."

","""Atonement"" is a movie evolving around a young girl who falsely accuses her sister's brother of rape and thus ruins and influences the life and relationship of both of them.<br/><br/>The production is of high value, delivers beautiful pictures and a very earnest and atmospheric set-up. Unfortunately, at times it is a bit hard to follow the story because at several points the flashbacks and time shifts include such great deals of time that the coherence is suffering. The ending, on the contrary, is pretty strong and achieves to weaken the negative impact of the questionable story-telling. I like how parts of the movie are proved wrong and how the audience is surprised by that. However, it would have been of benefit to tell one story consequently and not different stories of false accusations, war and love.<br/><br/>All in all it is a very well-produced and serious movie but in my eyes it is not superb. On the other hand I have to admit that I'm not a great fan of historical movies anyway, so I can guess that many people will like the film a lot better than I do and it is definitely worth a watch."
"winopaul","2","2","4","18 April 2017"," As rotten as its subject
","I guess probabilities exist that would see me taking out Aliens and Cowboys, Child 44, and this piece of crap from the library on the same day. All three suck, and often in the same way.<br/><br/>This movie is a Mean Girls with level-1 Tarantino, a schedule II Shyamalan, with an Altman tracking shot kicker. The Tarantino is because it jumps around in time, a very 1990s device and pretty bankrupt in this day and age. Worse yet, it plays the exact same scene over, just from a slightly different POV, so it wastes your time while it confused the story-line. Its a Shyamalan since it has a sociopath twist at the end. This allows the writers to hurt you the same way the creeptastic girl in the story hurts everyone around her.<br/><br/>The Altman kicker is the long tracking shot at Dunkirk, in a scene that was irrelevant to the story. Its as if these young directors have to brag at cocktail parties, ""Oh I shot a horse chase in the desert (Aliens and Cowboys), or in this case, ""Oh I shot a beach scene from WWII."" Because the technology of movie-making has advanced so much, the scene does look better, but these self-absorbed directors put it down solely to their genius.<br/><br/>The horror of this movie is that it made money and got acclaim, which will only encourage more of this self-indulgent crap. I guess if your brain is still infantile, and you like pretty colors and distracting sounds, yeah, this film is great for that. If you have moved past a noisy mobile dancing over your crib, to the point where things have to make at least a little sense, this movie is atrocious.<br/><br/>Acting is good, other than direction that has them all seem autistic, as they all pause for 12 seconds rather than respond to whatever manufactured senseless dramatic situation they are faced with. Direction is so inept he changes the actress playing the ""star"" and also starts referring to her by her last name instead of her first. What point in this crap, symbolism she is changing? Go back to film school, and stay there.<br/><br/>Robin Williams said ""Cocaine is God's way of telling you that you make too much money."" A deleted scene titled ""Walking through the fields"" is God's way of telling you that you have too much budget.<br/><br/>The movie is titled Atonement, but that is not what it is about. First off, there is no atonement. The creep girl does not recant until she is 79 years old. Robbie's mother, her parents, everyone she hurt is dead. Cumberbatch is dead, unable to reply to her new accusations. Some atonement. The movie seems to be a love story, until the Shyamalan happens and its all a lie, told by the lying sociopath narcissist girl who ruins everyone's life, including the people that watch this drek.<br/><br/>So just when you think are are watching a move about a young couple, its really about this despicable creepy crap brat. Great, I love to see scheming creep sociopaths, especially ones that maneuver their lies into a big life payoff.<br/><br/>You could toss out all the war scenes and the scenes with Anorexic Girl. Then it would be about Briony. You would have to expand her POV and linearize the story line. Thing is, who would want to watch this creepy little liar? A novelist might think the story is all about the little budding writer, but everyone else sees her as an ancillary little distraction to life. A dork.<br/><br/>There were implausibilities. Like why didn't the police re-trace Robbie's path to prove he couldn't have tried to rape the girl? And prison for attempted rape, pretty much a mild assault? No, hardly. Even if her daddy was Lord Truplewaite of Devon on Hardwicke.<br/><br/>The movie was like a promo reel for the director, showing off his scenes, the hiding from the Boche, the trudging in the field, the hospital scene. I guess that is why I hate this movie so much. The soldiers coming into the hospital moved me to tears, and rather than stick to a coherent logical story, he had to bounce off to his next self-indulgent show-off clip reel.<br/><br/>I agree with another commentator. That there is a privileged class in the world that never had to work at anything and always is guaranteed to have a happy ending. So a happy ending is boring to them, whereas to us its the rarest of occurrences. I am sorry that the Marie Antoinettes of the world like this movie, it shows we are in need of a colony collapse disorder."
"william_herbert","4","2","4","7 August 2014"," A great cast and some well-written characters are crippled by a weak script, a prolonged runtime, and an egotistical director
","I was thoroughly unimpressed with this movie. Full disclaimer: I have not read the book, so this review is based entirely on my experience with the film. My rating of this film may be a bit on the harsh side, as this film has many merits to it. I believe however, that it failed overall as a FILM. It did not entertain, it did not entice, it did not pull on my emotions, and it did not hold me in suspense. It did have me throwing my hands up in frustration at the constant Oscar-begging and pseudo-bohemian attempts to impress the viewer.<br/><br/>Firstly, the merits. The acting was superb. Kiera Knightly was impeccable as the melancholy, disinterested, and later downright morose older sister. A young Saoirse Ronan showed us all that she does indeed have acting chops despite later, less impressive performances in her career. Of course James McAvoy was wonderful as the victim, particularly in the sequence in which he writes and then hands ""the letter"" to Briony. The cinematography was also excellent. The use of color to convey the change in mood throughout the film was well done, and of course there was what may very well be one of the most expensive shots in cinema, which I will come back to later. <br/><br/>Despite these wonderful aspects, the film just had far too many problems to merit a positive, or even average, score. First off, the extraneous scenes. This movie had so many useless scenes. The aforementioned expensive shot, of the Dunkirk evacuation, was for the most part pointless. In fact a very large portion of the not-insignificant time spent on Robbie in the war was useless, as far as the story being told. It conveyed the horrors of war, yes, but why was it in this film? This was not a war movie. This was a story about a woman and her struggle with the guilt of a lie she told that reverberated throughout the subsequent decades. Robbie never even mentions the war during his albeit ultimately fictional rant against Briony. He does, however, mention his time in jail. Which we never see. Would his time in jail not have sufficed? Could he not have died in jail? Or could it not have taken five minutes instead of a half hour to show his death at war so we could get some more Briony character progression?<br/><br/>While I am on the topic of extraneous material, let's talk about the constant duplication of scenes. We see Briony's point of view, and then we see Robbie's. Aside from the vase breaking, what did we glean from these drawn out scenes? Particularly the scene in which we watch the film in reverse for a prolonged amount of time. I am all for unconventional or slow-moving film styles, as long as they have a POINT. As long as they contribute more to the film than another, more captivating style. I did not feel as though these scenes meshed with the plot, or the mood the film was going for. <br/><br/>All of these extraneous scenes are the cause of the largest problem this film suffers from. For the subject of the film, Briony's character gets a paltry amount of screen time. I wanted to see her development, her struggle with the tremendous guilt she felt. I did not get this, unfortunately. I got quick excerpts from her life, enough to see her current state, but not enough to relate to the character, and empathize with her. <br/><br/>The plot had some unfortunate hiccups as well. I cannot help but feel as though all of this could have been prevented if someone had just talked to Briony. Seriously there were so many opportunities. ""Sorry that I don't love you Briony but you're twelve, also this is totally consensual between your sister and I."" I couldn't help but feel as though the people in the story had to act out of character just so that the plot could move forward, which to me signals poor screen writing. Another note about the plot - if a man is in a movie that is even remotely linked to WWII, and he goes to war, and there is a girl waiting for him, he is almost certainly going to die. This is a frustrating trope. I know that WWII was horrendous and many lost their lives, but when you can see it a mile away it just takes something away from the emotional devastation that is intended. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Atonement"" suffered from a poor script and a director who spent too much time patting himself on the back and not enough time focusing on the subject - and the point - of the story he was tasked to recount."
"markfranh","5","2","4","3 March 2014"," A film in two parts; one excellent, one, well, best not to think about the second half
","Am I allowed to give two marks for the two halves of a film? If I could, it would have been 8 for the first hour and a 3 for the second hour.<br/><br/>The first half was wonderful. Wonderful plot with the directing of the excellent cast everything it should be and the scenery, cinematography etc there to SUPPORT what was going on, not just to be there to carry the film. <br/><br/>The awards this film won must have been given for this first hour as the second half didn't deserve them.<br/><br/>When the second half started, we couldn't believe what a let down it all was. The film just seemed to suddenly meander from scene to scene with no real purpose and even less plot. Joe Wright's usually astute direction of the story seemed to disappear and we wondered if he hadn't been replaced by somebody else when he lost interest in the project and that the new guy didn't have a clue what to do with the story he was left.<br/><br/>Scenes were included simply because they were visually dramatic, not because they added to the plot. For example, the lengthy scene done in one take of Jame McIvoy wandering around the beach with troops everywhere. It accomplished nothing in terms of adding to the plot with its extreme length but it certainly was visually stunning. Why film it? The term ""self-indulgence"" by the director came to mind. <br/><br/>And the scene with the older Briany and the French soldier in the hospital. What was the point? Was it supposed to make me feel differently about Briany? It didn't. Did it relate to something in the book that Wright had left out when deciding what to include in the movie? Possibly, but not having read the book I don't know. It just felt pointless.<br/><br/>Filming clichés soon appeared one after the other for lack of anything else to do. Lady MacBeth scrubbing her hands to get the blood out? Soldiers walking through a field of poppies? A character standing in front of a giant screen showing two lovers kissing? Lights being turned on one by one as another key character walks toward the camera? The underwater image towards the film's end? Come on! I mean, really? That's all you can come up with?<br/><br/>""Drifting aimlessly"" another phrase that came to mind when thinking about the second half of the movie. It just felt like Wright didn't know what to do with the material so thought he'd shoot some nice scenes and put them together and hope it all worked. It didn't.<br/><br/>Arguably, the point of most of the second half is only finally revealed in the closing 5 minutes with the dramatic narrative conclusion. I get that. But by then it was far too late. We were annoyed, we'd lost interest, we were bored and we no longer cared."
"hahnell","3","2","4","19 November 2011"," Please -- Read the Novel Instead
","Ian McEwan's novel Atonement was beautiful: spare and elegant, surprising, thoughtful. Excellent writing, in short, like many of his novels are. So I figured a movie of Atonement would have to be at least pretty good. Oh, how wrong I was. If not for the handsome James McAvoy, I would have bailed early on. The only thing that kept me from stopping the movie and finding something better to do was remembering how much I enjoyed the book. The movie is overlong and self-consciously gorgeous, with long, ponderous shots of scenery and the skeletal Keira Knightley that serve no real purpose except to make this movie seem Merchant-Ivory like. Or something.<br/><br/>Along with Mr. McAvoy, Vanessa Redgrave was the highlight, although she only gets a little bit at the end; she was far and away the best actor in the film. Really, Keira Knightley -- she can't act.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel like this is a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back again. Do yourself a favour and read the book instead."
"moviesleuth2","10","2","4","12 March 2009"," A marvelous, sweeping love story
","""Atonement"" is one of those movies that completely draws you in and never really lets you go, even after the credits start rolling. It is to the film's credit that it manages to be completely unforgettable, even after a year of having viewed it.<br/><br/>The film is divided into two parts: the first half is a mystery that is slowly unveiled, and told from two different viewpoints. The second half is more straightforward, but it has a number of flashbacks. This is a densely plotted film, and, especially during the first hour, it requires absolute attention from the viewer (don't worry. The film is so good that this will happen anyway). As such, I can't give much in way of the plot (just watch the trailer).<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding. Keira Knightly has never been one to ""sell out"" to Hollywood; she clearly only takes on projects that interest her and challenge her. Her performance as Cecilia Tallis is easily her best performance, and should have earned her a second Oscar nomination. She captures every emotion perfectly, and uses restraint to emphasize the effect of her emotions. Likewise, James McAvoy equals her, giving us a perfect romantic foil for Cecilia. McAvoy wisely avoids giving us a Harlequin romance lead; instead he creates a real person that has a powerful romantic connection with his co-star.<br/><br/>Saoirse Roman, despite being very young, holds her own against the up-and-coming A-listers. She's a natural, and perfectly captures the complexity of her character. Much of what she does and feels is presented without words, and only a truly talented actress like Roman can pull it off. Her Oscar nomination was well deserved. Her older counterpart, played by Romala Garai, is so good that it is hard to believe that these are two different actresses, and not one character that simply grew up. It's tough to pull off, but Roman and Garai are perfectly in synch.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" could have gone wrong in so many ways, but director Joe Wright manages to keep it all straight. He keeps things moving, including a 5-minute long, unbroken take across a soldier-filled beach. Additionally, the soft light he chose for the film enhances the experience, producing an almost dream-like quality to the film, and even in the war scenes, it works.<br/><br/>The best part of ""Atonement"" is that it's kept on a personal level. While all the characters are caught up in an extraordinary event, the story that connects them is purely personal. There is no ""national scandal,"" or flashing photographers wanting a scoop on this drama. There are only a few characters who knew about what happened, and novelist Ian McEwan and especially Wright wisely focus on them. Wright keeps the epic scale of the war intact, but he personalizes the drama.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" is a beautiful and harrowing film. It is not to be missed, and was easily one of the best, if not THE best, films of 2007."
"I_John_Barrymore_I","Null","2","4","5 March 2009"," Atonement
","A magnificent, visually splendid, powerful drama (I cried towards the end!) which I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it.<br/><br/>James MacAvoy plays one of those classic benighted, put-upon, noble, dignified, victim-of-fate characters that - unless Bjork's playing them in a Lars von Trier picture - are rarely more than rag dolls or punching bags for the writer to pile plot points on, but his character is so well-written, so likable, and his performance so good that every little blow he's struck resonates deeply.<br/><br/>The initial stages of the love story at the heart of the picture somehow don't feel rushed even though the two leads spend remarkably little time on screen together, and - dare I say it? - Kiera Knightley turns in a fantastic performance that has proved to me once and for all that she is indeed capable of great things.<br/><br/>Not only is there a powerful love story, there's also a fascinating moral question running throughout that isn't really wrapped up and is left to the viewer to decide.<br/><br/>Aside from the stunning, sledgehammer twist ending, the final moments are incredible in that they dissolve all the film's flaws. Issues I had with pacing in one scene that seemed interminable and my annoyance at the overly-choppy timeline just went away, all fully justified by the time the credits rolled.<br/><br/>It looks beautiful, has a great score, and the scene at Dunkirk, an endless tracking shot of huge scope and ambition, is as impressive as anything I've seen in a war picture."

I thought I was going to spend hours sitting and flowing through the infinity of boredom. I guess the elements sorted themselves during the movie and I was shocked - the movie I was watching was great!

","First of all, a comment on style. Atonement ticks all the boxes in Britishness. You cannot but love the mannerisms, the photography and the dialogue. A classy film only Brits can do.<br/><br/>Then, it's the acting. Although all performances are great, there are two performances that stand above the rest. James McAvoy and Saoirse Ronan. Sometimes characters define the actors, but these two actually redefined their characters. Keira is undoubtedly stunning and lovable and she did indeed great, but she's overshadowed by the sheer quality of the other two. From the other two Brionys, Vanessa Redgrave shows what an excellent actress she is by perfectly mimicking the posture, gestures and talk of little Saoirse, while Romola Garai unfortunately was not such a good fit (and it seems this is mainly a casting error).<br/><br/>Finally, the story is very well told and while the movie may leave a sad taste, it is actually a proof of its strength. This is what good movies do. They have the capability to imprint sentiments to the audience."
"bmcdannell","8","2","4","19 August 2008"," From a 50+ perspective: Thumbs Up
","This was one of those movies that we were sorely tempted to eject 30 minutes into the viewing - and are very glad we didn't. It turned out to be the rare film that made you think and seriously analyze what you have seen; so much so that my wife is now reading the book to see how faithful the movie was to the novel.<br/><br/>It was certainly not without flaws, so let's get the major of those out of the way right up front: 1. The setting that was chosen (England prior to and during WWII) to construct the central transgression and link the dual message was just too easy and convenient, and the screenwriters even played with the time frame a bit to make it just that much easier. We felt this was a bit lazy.<br/><br/>2. The inconsistency in the methods used to shift back and forth in time was disconcerting and smacked of self-satisfied gimmickry. Some time shifts were labeled as such, some were not, some reran a just viewed scene from a different perspective, most did not. It just became too clever and ultimately annoying.<br/><br/>Now down to the stuff that raised the movie above its flaws: The film asks - and answers - dual but closely related questions: (a) Can the artist atone for his/her transgressions through his/her artistry? and (b) Can society atone for the atrocity and horror of war by writing history to reflect on war's heroes and victories? The answer in both cases is clearly No, and the film does a very good job of illustrating why.<br/><br/>Briony destroys at least five lives (hers, her sister's, her cousin's, Robbie's, and his mother's) with a petulant, adolescent false witness - and spends most of the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for her transgression. Her narcissism prevents her from summoning the wherewithal to face and attempt to undo the wrong directly, and time and dreadful circumstance quickly rob her of any opportunity to do so. By the end of the movie we find that she has written a novel in which the people she destroyed are blessed with a happy-ever-after fictional existence - and she has even been able to come out of herself far enough to expose the fiction and face her responsibility.<br/><br/>As the events of the central characters' lives unfold, we see a reflection of the primary conflict in the circumstances of the war raging around them. We are shown the foul atrocity that is the reality of war, then at war's end we are presented not with the images of the dead, the maimed, the maddened or even the ravaged earth, but instead offered the weary but smiling, victorious heroes arriving home. This is the atonement for war. But it doesn't work for us, because we have been there with Robbie and we know what he was subject to was so horrible as to preclude atonement.<br/><br/>And so it is also for Briony. Her rewriting of her own history cannot atone for what she has done. We can also realize that her entire life has been an incarnation of Hamlet's ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy, wherein the only thing that has enabled her to continue living has been her fear - given her horrible transgression - of what may lay beyond.<br/><br/>Very special mention must be made of Vanessa Redgrave's short but incredible performance. While doing her brief monologue as the now aged Briony, she says with her eyes more than all the other characters in the film combined. While she calmly and quietly lays out the basis of her last novel - and the fact that it does not reflect reality - her eyes plead with us for forgiveness. She is facing death. She is afraid. She wants more than anything in the world to hear someone say, ""We forgive you."" But the desperation in her eyes lets us know that she is fully aware that the only people who could rightfully say that to her are long dead. It is an extremely powerful moment.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws and the fact that the movie's central questions have all too obvious answers, there is enough artistry and power in this film that we would highly recommend it."

","""You can only imagine the truth."" <br/><br/>It's got the worst tagline that I've ever read, but who cares. Just wink at the so-so romance of ""The Notebook"" and pan your eyes to this award-winning tear-jerker coming from director Joe Wright (director, Pride and Prejudice).<br/><br/>""Atonement"" is definitely the best movie I've seen in weeks. This romantic tale is something that I've never heard of, and by far, it is the best love story that I've ever pondered on (it even overshadows the love story of ""Amelie""). Just neglect the unremitting clamor of the film's critics (they criticize this movie heavily because Keira Knightley's in it and for the plot's ""shallowness""). Every facet of this movie is truly extraordinary: the story, the performances, the direction, the art direction, the score and the cinematography. I could go on praising this Hollywood gem for years.<br/><br/>It tells us about the tragic love affair between Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and their gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Their liaisons were later torn apart by a testimony coming from Cecilia's young jealous sister, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), falsely accusing Robbie as a ""sex maniac."" Robbie was arrested and was sent to the army, leaving Cecilia behind, crying over their love's ill fate. Their three-way tale kept on rolling over the years, until Briony on her late teens (Romola Garai) realized what mishap she has caused.<br/><br/>It's about a lie which severed multiple relationship ties. It speaks of how the mishandling of words can lead to chaos, and how tough it is to accept your wrongdoings and take those words back. I loved how the three Brionies (Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave) delivered those crucial few words of wisdom. I love Ian McEwan (author of the novel this film was based on) for shining the light on that maxim.<br/><br/>Saoirse Ronan undoubtedly has delivered the best performance among the acting ensemble, which rightfully earned her an Academy Award nomination. Meanwhile, Keira Knightley keeps on irritating me with her perfectly shaped jawline and that accent of hers, but thank God, her performance did not ruin the entire film (unlike what she did on all the three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" installments). James McAvoy was great in his role. I cannot imagine where would this movie go without him. It's a pity that he wasn't recognized that much.<br/><br/>Joe Wright's camera-work is reminiscent of Olivier Dahan's direction in La Vie En Rose, and I admire him for that. We owe the movie's big hit in the box office to him and his directing prowess. His long shot on the Dunkirk beach is something that every movie buff should see, also for its wonderful cinematography and the set design.<br/><br/>The original score of Dario Marianelli was too much like Philip Glass' score on ""The Hours."" But if we should compare the two, Marianelli's would come out as the better one, hands down. It was Marianelli's score which kept me awake throughout the course of the film (romance/war movies easily puts me to sleep) and it also glued my eyes to the screen. The tone's generally hyper, it grows even more tense whenever the plot arrives at one of its climaxes, and it practically enlivens any scene which lacks some vivacity.<br/><br/>With Joe Wright's direction, Saoirse Ronan's powerful execution of her role and Dario Marianelli's compelling score combined, ATONEMENT is a film that you seriously wouldn't want to miss."
"jaychou_21","9","2","4","22 February 2008"," The best British film I've ever seen!
","I finally had the chance to see this much talked-about film last week and what a fulfilling viewing experience it was! It lived up to my expectations and didn't fail to deliver in all the scrutinous aspects of film-making.<br/><br/>To begin with, Atonement is a crafty interpretation of Ian McEwan's best-selling novel of the same title. Christopher Hampton did a great job on the screenplay, though I wasn't very impressed with Joe Wright's work as the director. The (over)usage of juxtaposition between Briony's perspective and the 'real' event worked most of the time, but the recurring flashbacks would be too much for the ordinary moviegoer. I'm not certain if it is Wright's style or technique but he deviates to mislead the viewers at some points in the movie. There were also some unnecessary scenes that could have been deleted without affecting the story.<br/><br/>The film's art direction, set design, costume design and cinematography successfully captured the essence of the plot and the emotion of the characters, as well as the atmosphere of the film's setting. It takes us from the laid-back splendor of the Tallis estate on the summer of 1935 to the dreadful scenes of World War II. I particularly liked the long shot on the Dunkirk beach, where the singing soldiers' somber songs of valor and hope combined with Robbie's longing-turned-desperation to see Cecilia again touched a part of my heart. But my favorite part of the movie has to be the sequence starting from Cecilia composing herself in front of the mirror, with opera playing in the background, interspersed with the shots of Robbie typing his 'anatomical' letter of apology to Cee, leading up to the scene in the library. It was pure grandeur.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable things about the movie is the superb musical score by Dario Marianelli. It's the first time in recent memory that I've seen a movie where a typewriter is used as a device to present most of the film's musical score. The incorporation of the typewriter rouses the viewer's emotions and builds up tension, thus adding to the thrill. It was used masterfully in the scenes where Briony read Robbie's letter and during Paul Marshall's wedding - the ascending pace of the typewriter's sounds matching that of the simultaneously increasing volume as the scene drastically progresses makes up for a magnificent (and not to say dramatic) finish.<br/><br/>In the acting arena, Saoirse Ronan (pronounced ˈsɪrʃə ˈroʊnən though honestly, at first I thought her name sounds like seahorse lol) is a sensational discovery. She is the perfect choice for the role of the young Briony Tallis. Ronan understood the guileless profundity of her character. Her expressive eyes speak and convey a wide range of emotions that provoke our thoughts and challenge our capability to judge. She portrayed Briony very well and judging from her striking performance in the movie, Ronan is a very promising new talent and she'll definitely make it far. I'm pretty sure she'll give Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) and Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam) a run for their money.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone is the very talented but underrated James McAvoy as Robbie Turner. His strong and arresting performance in Atonement as the ill-fated housekeeper's son who fell in love with his master's daughter clearly shows why he received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor. You can see depth and derive profound understanding of his character just by looking in his eyes and observing his gestures. I felt that his work in this movie was overlooked by the Academy members. Maybe in the next couple of years he'll finally wow them and get his long-overdue Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>While Ronan and McAvoy breathed and lived their characters, Keira Knightley gave a satisfactory portrayal as Cecilia Tallis, Briony's elder sister and Robbie's dearly beloved. Her acting was 'OK' throughout the movie but she didn't exert the same amount of passion, fire and spirit as her co-actors did. I didn't see anguish or turmoil in both her facial expressions and body language that would convince me that she is in a war-torn time and place. She gave too much finesse that it seemed like she's not affected by the ongoing chaos at all. And finally, her unnaturally hasty line delivery just seemed very anticipated and rehearsed, that's why I didn't feel the intensity of her acting in this movie. Same goes with Romola Garai as the 18 year-old Briony Tallis. She was good, but I know she could have done better.<br/><br/>The one that gave body to the whole film was the 77 year-old Briony, played by the legendary Vanessa Redgrave, who did her meaningful part excellently, substantiating guilt, remorse and enlightenment. She may have appeared on screen for only a mere 5 minutes or so but her performance was pitch-perfect. The closure she gave - ""with no rhymes, no embellishments"" - brought tears to the eyes and tugged my heartstrings when I least expect it.<br/><br/>The ending was executed perfectly. It wasn't over the top nor exaggerated - just the right tone and mood to give the audience an emotional upheaval and a heartrending realization of the meaning of the word atonement.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Atonement is more than just an artsy film about two lovers separated by war and betrayed by the consequences of a child's naïve understanding of the world around her - it's a lesson about integrity, strength, endurance, hope and compassion, and how the absence of those can deprive us of happiness, change the course of our destiny and ever ruin people's lives.<br/><br/>This film just blew me away so it currently ranks 15th on the list of my most favorite movies of all time (14th had I not seen Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle the day after), securing its position as the best British film I've seen so far."
"raymond-massart","9","2","4","19 February 2008"," One of the best productions in recent years
","Should I have read the book before seeing this movie? Not necessarily of course but in the case of ""Atonement"" it was certainly an advantage as I asked myself how the richness of the vocabulary, the suggestive delicacy of the verbally painted pictures and the intricate pattern of the relationships between the various characters would be rendered on the screen. The answer to these intriguing questions is not difficult at all: the cinematographic version has come as close to the original literary work as one can possibly get. The author, Ian McEwan, always excels in depicting life as it was in England in the early 20th century with its restraining formalism, hypocrisy and a numbing form of awkwardness that often lead to a lasting form of tragedy. All these elements are constantly present throughout the movie and together with the excellent acting, the captivating images of landscapes and the camera's keen eye for detail, one cannot but acclaim ""Atonement"" as one of the best productions in recent years."
"barryrd","10","2","4","12 February 2008"," An act of malice leaves a bitter legacy
","Occasionally a movie comes along that leaves you with a great feeling of satisfaction. This movie has the layered effect of a modern novel, looking at life's events from the perspective of time and drawing them together In a way that gives some sort of closure. There is no way to change the past; we can look back with remorse but admitting the truth is the right way to deal with the human cost. <br/><br/>Let it be said that the first 30 minutes are slow-going but this background is necessary to understand the story that follows. Pay attention to the perspective of the young people whose lives will quickly unfold and unravel after the initial scenes take place.<br/><br/>The movie gives us images of great beauty, childhood fantasies, grotesque scenes of war, actual newsreel footage and a sad incident that haunts the main characters for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>British cinema and literature often deal with the underdog but not in the Frank Capra tradition of happy endings. This alternative tradition says that life can be mean and unfair, don't gloss it over with fairy tales cloaked in patriotism and heroism. This movie delivers that message in a fine piece of film-making by director Joe Wright."
"valadas","6","2","4","12 February 2008"," A simple unhappy story
","As we know impubescent children, mainly girls, tend to be mythomaniac in what concerns sexuality mainly when moved by scenes that they watch and whose meaning they don't understand or feel fully, considering his age and the absence yet of any sexual urge. This is aggravated when someone they love is involved. Then they can be led to lie and arrive to convince themselves they are telling the truth. In this movie a small girl accuses falsely a man she loves of raping a friend moved by this kind of feelings and with that she ruins her life and the lives of his elder sister and his lover, the man whom she accuses. The story is rather simple, very simply told and not original enough to deserve a high mark. However the movie is well made and worth to be seen mainly by the acting of all three main characters involved in that tragic story. The atonement suffered by the young girl develops itself through her whole life and ends in a remarkable and moving scene (the last one of the movie) in a very original way that one which makes us to wonder where reality ends and fiction begins."
"petsteph1","6","2","4","8 February 2008"," Hmm, Not Bad But Not Brilliant...
","A previous reviewer mentioned the shift between the first hour and the remainder and I agree. While beautifully shot, and after some excellent tension-building scenes, the rest of the movie seemed to be making earnest attempts at resolving the plot lines but never really did; perhaps because they weren't in the novel. I don't know because I haven't read the novel and probably won't. I can't gush at the performances of the two leads because they never did convince me, unlike Saoirse Ronan, who played the young Briony, and Romola Garai, as the 18 year old Briony. Although this character was the villain of the piece I found I had far more interest in her, and sympathy for her, than for James McAvoy and Keira Knightley. I think their difficulty was in building characterizations out of sparse script material, and the result was a pastiche of clichés lifted out of films like Gosford Park, and similar depicting the English upper-class pre-war period. Once James McEvoy was taken away by the police, the film lost cohesion and became a series of scenes, again beautifully photographed, but never coming together to provide a sense of unity.<br/><br/>The Dunkirk scene, as cinematically impressive as it is, left me thinking it was there to compensate for the lack of plot development. After I'd marveled at the continuous shot along the beach, the planning and choreography that had gone into it, the brilliant set design, I really had to ask for the sake of the story 'And...the point here is?"" Things pick up again back in war-torn London, with Romola Garai, as the 18 year old Briony atoning for her crime by becoming a nurse, but just when I was being pulled back into the story, which had always really been about this character, we get a rather confusing scene with Keira and James and and an even more confusing appearance by Vanessa Redgrave who portrays Briony as an old woman, the author of the novel that tells this whole story. She tries to explain that she fictionalized the lovers' reunion because, well, she could... but in fact they both died apart...and that's the movie.<br/><br/>Maybe this is the kind of movie that should have a crawler along the bottom of the screen saying ""This is a very, very sensitive film..."" just to remind us not to go expecting a larger and more satisfying experience."
"x-smurf-x","10","2","4","5 February 2008"," Fantastic and Captivating!
","I read McEwans book of Atonement before I saw the film, which I would definitely recommend. When I watched the film it was all I had expected it to be and more. I was captivated by the confusion of Briony's actions, Celcilia's and Robbies love and the brilliant ending. The entire cinematography were perfectly arranged around the story, and created a flawless atmosphere. The music and lighting was what really struck me, corresponding with the scenes fantastically. There was, I'll admit, a lack of dialogue - though the characters presented by McEwan had always seemed concealed with thought, thus allowing the audience to create their own reasoning; conveyed extremely well in the film.<br/><br/>The war scenes were perfectly effective and truthful of gore and emotion. The ending was surprising, even though I had read the book; I had not fully understood it. I felt it was a severe twist to the story, yet made sense of Briony's character. The last scene with elderly Briony quickly became one of my favourites, with the truth of reality rather than a fairytale ending where everyone has a chance to right their wrongs.<br/><br/>Atonement has become my favourite film, and for audiences who enjoy a similar genre, this is one of my first recommendations! Bravo!"
"kidge88","10","2","4","1 January 2008"," Atonement
","I wanted to single out Vanessa Redgrave for special acclaim, as she brought the whole movie together, I felt, in a very purposeful summary of the consequences of her actions as a very immature and spoiled 13-year old. She is an astonishingly powerful and convincing actor. That takes nothing away from the other key actors, who quite simply were brilliant.<br/><br/>A very thoughtless and selfish act, effectively created the plot for an astonishingly beautiful and well-crafted piece of cinematic genius. I saw this movie on my own, as my wife was away, and four young rowdy teenage girls walked into the theatre and sat beside me. Half way through the movie, I noticed that the girl immediately beside me was gasping and sobbing, which almost moved me to tears also. The whole four girls had the tissues out, well before the end of the movie. Atonement, I must say made me feel what it must have been like to live through the horrors of WW2 and it made me feel great compassion for the nurses, who gave so much of themselves at a time when there was very little that medicine could do and the best treatment was to 'just be there' and sit, talking with the wounded and dying.<br/><br/>I agree with all the other comments I have read and will certainly go back and see this beautiful movie again with my wife...and take some tissues. I was extremely impressed with the unexpected impact this movie had, on my feelings. It was never predictable and had a great 'grab-bag' of emotions, scattered at unpredictable interludes, so you were kept guessing all the way through. I now need to go and buy the novel!"
"moutonbear25","9","2","4","9 December 2007"," Nothing To Be Sorry About
","Tap tap tap goes the typewriter. The tapping is coming faster and hitting harder. The pace is set and the race has officially started. Director, Joe Wright's ATONEMENT bursts out of the gate from the moment it starts, as a pan away from a modeled replica of the Tallis manor reveals a parade of toy animals and ends aptly on the purported queen of this particular animal kingdom, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan). Briony is only thirteen years old but she is just about to finish her very first play. This precocious child is captivating. She is at once frightening while just as frightened. Her focus is eerily burning and her need for command of the situation and those involved motivate her every decision. On this particularly sweltering day, Briony believes her play to be her greatest accomplishment yet and sees her future more brightly boundless than even before. She has no idea that everything is about to crumble beneath her. Chance allows her to witness a few things she was not meant to and before long she makes a desperate play to regain control of her destiny. Who knew that one little girl could cause so much trouble for so many people and invite turmoil into her family for the rest of her days by telling one misguided lie?<br/><br/>When Briony falsely accuses Robbie (James McAvoy), her sister, Cecilia's (Keira Knightly) lover, of a horrible crime, he is arrested and sent to prison. It isn't clear whether Briony was aware of how serious her accusations were or how far Robbie would be taken from Cecilia and his future as a result but it is clear that she interrupted a love of immense proportion. ATONEMENT's first act goes back and forth between Briony's breakdown and the escalating sexual tension between Robbie and Cecilia. Cecilia is not your typical period drama maiden. She is provocative and sharp-tongued. For all her fierce self-awareness though, she has made a point to repress her longing for Robbie out of respect for status. Robbie too has been hiding how he feels to appease the rules that apply to status and boundaries, not so much out of respect though but rather for blind tradition. Society's restraints cannot hold back a love of this magnitude. The passion bustling between them is palpable and exacerbated by the heat; it is no wonder that it all comes to a head on this fated day and is halted no sooner than it is just begun. As they are only given the chance to wet their lips with each other's taste before being ripped apart, theirs is a relationship that will live in a suspended state of foreplay for a long time to come.<br/><br/>When Robbie is taken prisoner, ATONEMENT shifts into a new and noticeably different movement. The intensity carefully crafted in the first act dissipates as the characters enter their own individual limbos, left to meander aimlessly in search of repair. The build toward Briony's lie was punctuated by a sharp, concise score by Dario Marianelli and highlighted by Seamus McGarvey's bright and elegantly fluid cinematography. Both artists employ entirely new approaches toward the action that unfolds in the lie's aftermath. The score becomes dark, somber - less driven and more haunting. The visuals follow suit, feeling heavy and dense. The change halts the flow of the film and feels like a misstep momentarily. Once you catch the breath you were holding previously, the severity of the scenario sinks in and the fresh aesthetic takes on its own significance. It cannot help but feel longer or slower in comparison but how else are we or the characters expected to feel when they are living their new lives lost and haunted by a past they could not control? Besides being relevant to the tone of the story, the shift also gives birth to a four and a half minute shot depicting the 1940 evacuation at Dunkirk Beach that is mesmerizing in its grace and awesome in scope.<br/><br/>ATONEMENT is a fresh and surprising spectacle. Wright impressed with charm and poise last time out in 2005's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (also starring Knightly) but his latest grabs the period drama by its snotty superiority and turns it inside out, thanks in no small part to Ian McEwan's much loved novel of the same name. The gravity of how one bad decision can ruin many lives resonates loudly and the guilt that follows gives way to the need for forgiveness from those who were hurt and from the one that caused the pain. ATONEMENT does not judge Briony for what she's done; instead it allows her the chance to heal and make things right without ever presuming that her recovery is inevitable. For breaking convention and for demonstrating sincere respect for the story, the characters and the audience, Wright has absolutely nothing to be sorry for."

","I see a lot of people here saying they put off seeing this film because of its hype. Despite being a screenwriter/video editor, I am in this category. My rule of thumb is if critics love it, I will hate it. Well, this time the critics got it right. This is a great film. I can't give it a perfect ten because I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed and there were far too many twists for me to keep track of. I still have too many questions. (Maybe that's WHY some people would give it a perfect ten) it is a heartbreaking film but I feel also a misunderstood one. When you're my age (34) and a movie revolves around a 13 year old with an unreliable narrative, you know this Isn't going to go well but you also know SHE'S 13! Without spoiling the film, some events happen prior to Briony falsely accusing Robbie of rape that aren't exactly outside the realms of possibility of someone that WOULD commit rape. It's not impossible for a young impressionable child to deduce this from prior events. I had a lot of pre conceived notions before seeing this film. Every time this movie is mentioned, Briony is referred to as practically the worst villain in the cinematic universe. Having seen the film myself now, I think we need to go easier on her. She repents (atones, as the film IS called 'atonement') but it's too late in a twist I won't spoil for you. Your heart breaks for the fate of the characters yes, but your heart breaks for the young girl who (understandably) never had the courage to come forward with the real story until she was an old lady too. Or at least mine did.<br/><br/>My one gripe with the film is we never resolve once we do find out who did commit the crime and to whom, and in fact a little bit of logic would have told you who committed the crime based on who was missing that night, but I guess they weren't the point."

In the first act, many of the scenes are described from Briony's eye. The landscapes of England is really beautiful, but throughout the scene, there is always a feeling of tension. Especially after Briony happens to see a secret romance between Cecilia and Robbie, the situation gets accelerated. The background music, synchronized with sounds of typing prompts nervousness among audiences.
While Robbie is arrested and struggles to go back to Cecilia, we have to face severe conditions surrounding soldiers. Especially after watching ""Dunkirk"", I had to update my image of Operation Dynamo as a severer one. It is so heartbreaking, but James McAvoy's act is amazing. The last scene is a little bit unsatisfactory; since Briony seems always try to justify her action and the interview scene sounds rather explanatory than emotionally.

With the few exception of a few minor flaws or perhaps more correctly alternative approaches to a few scenes, this amazing movie depicts a fascinating romance, innocent youth, and bittersweet tragedy in a fantastic literally sweeping film presentation. There is a panoramic scene of Dunkirk that is Lost in Translation (2003) in its authentic experiential camera work. The few possible changes that might have enhanced the movie included taken more time to capture a smoothly realistic scene with the fly, allowing the audience to be as aware of the contents of a typed letter as the characters in the movie, a clearer presentation of the hunt for missing boys, a more detailed and emotional in depth examination of the arrest scene and the turn about of facing one's decision and reactions of the various parties involved, the evolution of the three soldiers later in the movie that suddenly become about two soldiers, and finally, a more reasonable presentation of a soldier who stumbles across a movie screen.

Not having had the chance to redeem herself with her sister, she rewrites her story, giving her back the lost happiness. One of the best finals I've ever seen."

Atonement is, in its simplest form, one of the best acts of storytelling in cinema history. This film is much more than a story, it's a view changer!

","In the 1930s English countryside, young Briony, an aspired writer with great imagination, just added the final touches to her first ever play. She waits for her cousins' arrival to stage it with them and show it to her family, including her older sister Cecilia, and house employees. However, she is mostly exited to show it to Robbie, the house gardener, for whom she has developed a crush on. Briony is unaware that Robbie's heart is already taken by Cecilia, who reciprocates the feelings. Their relationship successfully remains a secret to everyone until one day a particular incident crashes the peaceful days of the Tallis household and triggers a series of events that will leave consequent scars on the characters.<br/><br/>The movie is a two-hour long flashback seen at most times from the point of view of Briony, that we see growing from a young, naïve and selfish 13-year-old girl, to a more mature young women, and finally to a wise but regretful old lady. Everything within the plot revolves around the mistakes Briony has committed when she was younger and how she needs to understand them and to cope with their consequences as an adult, taking her on a journey towards personal development. The purity of Robbie and Cecilia's love is also very touching. Moreover, the way the movie is filmed is esthetically breathtaking, with a lot of beautiful and complex shots such as the Dunkirk beach one take scene. If the original soundtrack of Atonement won an Oscar it is also for a reason. Indeed, the music fits extremely well with each scenes of the movie and truly brings it to life. Some very well composed tracks include one of the first of the film which is made using the noises of Robbie's typing machine, and the long track which accompanies him during the Dunkirk scene and manages to this scene all its power. Finally, what also truly makes this movie worthwhile is the final twist, along with the very emotionally packed final scene. 
Atonement is therefore a very well executed movie whose beauty and uniqueness rests on its narration, its twist and turns, its complex characters and their development, its breathtaking cinematography and its original soundtrack. I highly recommend this movie to everyone but beware of some hard topics that are evoked in it."

","""Atonement"" is a rare beauty. A film that shatters hearts while bringing them peace at the same time.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The story plays out brilliantly and is of a certain brilliance that few films have ever achieved. Characters have such level of charisma that it is near impossible not to fall in love with each of them. Joe Wright showcases his genius in the way he tells this phenomenal and emotionally distressing film. The film touches one's heart in the deepest way, both with sadness and joy. *Cinematography/Editing: The work of Seamus McGarvey is incredible. The film begins with a dreamlike quality as we view the world through 13 year old Briony's eyes. As things start to become more mature and less childlike, the dreamlike quality fades. The color palette is of a simple beauty. The openness of certain shots and the closed in feeling of others serves to heighten the feeling of the characters throughout the film. Every frame is beautiful and authentic. The editing is beyond the level of many other films. The way the story is revealed to us is breathtaking. The transitions are seamless and the feeling of being inside of the characters becomes so natural due to the way in which the story is cut. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is wonderfully authentic and beautiful. Coupled with the incredible performances of the cast, it becomes an unforgettable film. James McAvoy and Keira Knightley deliver one of their best performances of their careers. Saoirse Ronan is incredible and talented beyond her years in this film. *Music/Sound Design: The film score is outstanding. Elements of a typewriter are sprinkled all throughout. The music plays wonderfully with the action taking place on screen. The whole film seems to work together wonderfully. The sound design is masterful. In the beginning it is especially strong. As we view the world through Briony's eyes, we hear the things she does with absolute clarity. Later, the sound brings forth a great deal of emotion, particularly when silence is used. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costumes, set pieces, and locations are of magnificent beauty and authenticity. One of the most impressive sequences is the long take at Dunkirk. Every chapter of the film feels real. There are not many special effects in the film, but the make-up and props are wonderfully within the realm of realism.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Atonement"" makes wonderful use of all the aspects of storytelling through film and is a masterpiece that will not soon be forgotten."
"ThomasDrufke","8","0","0","4 April 2018"," Perceptions
","Sometimes there are films that present a story in such a way that it makes you rethink the entire film after the first watch. Not that I didn't know what to expect with Atonement, considering I did read the synopsis before viewing, but there's something so incredibly impactful about the way Joe Wright adapts the acclaimed novel. You never exactly know the final direction until the last moments of pure devastation. And that's what I call an affective film.<br/><br/>It's not just Wright's direction however, as there's absolutely magnetic performances to dive deep into including one from the young Saoirse Ronan. Ronan plays Briony Tallis, who blames a serious crime on her sister's boyfriend because of her clouded judgement. It's an unfortunate tale of a person bringing their previous beliefs of a person into a judgement call that is far beyond their understanding, especially for someone who is only 13 years old. <br/><br/>The other notable thing about Atonement is the original score. The way Dario Marianelli factors in a typewriter to his already beautiful piano score is meticulously unique. It really adds an extra element to a deep film in its own right. It's also gorgeous film to look at, especially the long shots of the Dunkirk beach and the costume/production design throughout. And really, the film is a gorgeous tragedy, something that in order to be effective, has to be directed with extreme care and an original touch. Atonement is all of these things and more.<br/><br/>8.8/10"

","Bright sun bounces beautifully off Keira Knightley, convinced yet? As she chats to McCavoy sassily- not without delightful teasing- I say to myself, ""Okay, a love story"". This film has much more on its mind than the happy lives of two pretty lovers. 
One (innocent?) lie and Jame's wonderful romance and whole life deteriorates. Such strong emotion only cultivated with years of British plays! You are really rooting for a happy ending love story and it kills you they aren't together- which is most of the film. The story is refreshingly clean of cliches framed in a war era which cinematographer plays around with some impressive results. (a Dunkirk gritty continuous shot is done with great sympathy and care.) McCavoy climbs the biggest hurdles and we see more of him, reminiscing about Knightley and seemingly bringing her on screen. Lighting is great and a soundtrack that's heartbreaking, a tragic love story with twists and turns and turning my upset tummy thinking about all that can go wrong- just like my relationship with women."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","0","0","24 February 2018"," Atonement uses a creative narrative to detail a young romance during WWII.
","Sprawling across six decades, it chronicles a crime and the unfortunate consequences that follow. I have yet to see all of Joe Wright's filmography at the time of this review, but this is easily his most competent. Having not read the source material, I've heard that the book's structure makes it rather difficult to adapt. Seemingly Wright made it look easy. Embedding character perspectives, integrating flashbacks and utilising a clear three act structure. The journey we are taken on seems small in scale but draws in on the vast historical events of WWII to make an epic romance. It portrays how a child's vivid imagination and innocence of youth can cause damage to others in years to come. A false accusation that splits young love apart. There's something so ominous and vindictive about such a feeble mistake, that it packs one heck of a punch to the heart. The characters portrayed are all played out incredibly well and become fully developed by the heartbreaking end, which I'm sure will depress you all. It's a resonating tale, but one not without shock value. Some career best performances from Knightley, McAvoy and Ronan. They all captured the elegance and lavish lifestyle of the first act to then succumb to the emotional devastation of acts two and three. Wright's bold direction is what truly captivates, particularly the infamous one take scene of Dunkirk's evacuation. The props, the extras, the camera placement...it all came together to create an aria of desolation. It was sublime. The sound editing was notably fantastic also, especially the cacophony of typewriting sounds. Marianelli's score was beautifully haunting and deserved all the recognition it got. I do find the acts to be incredibly different and jarring, which consequently means I have to take a few minutes to adapt to the adjusted tempo of the narrative. Also, the gorgeous cinematography slowly fades as the running time gradually concludes. However, this is a solid piece of cinema that showcases excellent talent on and off screen."

"t-viktor212","10","0","0","12 July 2017"," Not a romance, not a class-conflict film, not a war movie.
","if it wasn't for the upcoming Dunkirk movie by Christopher Nolan, and if I didn't come the single-take shot, I probably would never see this film. I've never been interested in Pride and Prejudice, Anna Karenina or so-to-say pink novels adapted in film at all, although I did come across ""The Soloist"" by the same director, Joe Wright, which I liked but didn't have a lasting impact on me.<br/><br/>It is difficult to review this particular title. It is absolutely not a war movie, at least in my view, the sheer lenght of the sentimental relationship between McAvoy and Knightley's character prevents it from being a romance, the specific premise to which things are set in motion doesn't let it being a class-conflict centered story, although subthemes constantly pop up. It is to note that the class-conflict aspect of the film is mostly very subtle, particularly in relation to how that event which acts as premise to the plot is being dealt with by the aristocratic family of Knightley's character. Certain aspects reminded me of stage drama tragedies. <br/><br/>The title has much been criticized: how's the ending an Atonement at all? In my interpretation, it is a certain character's whole existence, with her being always thorn by the acts she did or omitted to do, that acts as a sort of ""atonement"", an attempt to somehow even out things between her and the other characters' relationships.<br/><br/>I would like to keep the plot as much as under wraps. I'd like to point out that, until the last 10 minutes, I kept trying to ignore as much as possible an aspect of the plot I found idiotic (why a certain character didn't simply just withdraw its statement?). It was those final minutes that provided an explanation which simply brought back things to be logical. <br/><br/>That said, the film is clever. Constant time-jumps and very subtle implications suggest some of the smartest portions of the plot. Don't expect Nolan-leveled complexity though. <br/><br/>Technically, again, the photography is outstanding, in nearly the entire film. Certainly, the peak is the 5+ minutes Dunkirk single take sequence, but really it is needless and too long to list every single outstanding shot the film had.<br/><br/>2008 was a year packed with too many good films that prevented Atonement from winning more Oscars. That said, Atonement deserves the acclaim it receives."

","You know the book. If you use public transport, you'll recognise it as the one everyone was reading circa 2004. There was that Booker Prize shortlisting, the reams of laudatory articles about its author, Ian McEwan. And then arrived the inevitable film adaptation, which should by rights be as stilted and anaemic an affair as most big-screen versions of 'serious' fiction, a (Merchant) ivory tower of self-important emoting from RSC heavyweights. Except that this quality-drenched effort is as stilted as a belly-dancer.<br/><br/>The movie's opening act is like a breathless celebration of pure heedless joy, a demonstration of the theory that the pinnacle of human happiness was reached by life in an English country house between the wars. Of course that was more true of those upstairs than downstairs. We meet Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley), the bold, older daughter of an old family, and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), their housekeeper's promising son, who is an Oxford graduate, thanks to the generosity of Cecilia's father. Despite their difference in social class, they are powerfully attracted to each other, and that leads to a charged erotic episode next to a fountain on the house lawn.<br/><br/>There's a careful contrast between the gilded youth of Cecilia and friends, literally glowing in Seamus McGarvey's burnished cinematography, Robbie's earthier colours and Briony's cold little face, pinched with self-importance, all setting up a conflict to come.But it's the tone that sets this apart from more traditional, ever-so-slightly-fusty inter-War dramas. Mature actors barely get a look in - near-cameos from Brenda Blethyn, Gina McKee and Vanessa Redgrave aside, no-one over the age of 30 even registers. <br/><br/>Magical-realist underwater scenes make the stately home seem an idyll, but the oppressive heat that radiates from the screen hints at tension, sexual and otherwise, bubbling under the surface. The most erotic sex scene in years - this despite the fact that both parties remain almost fully dressed - can't ease the growing dread. Even aside from the World War glowering on the horizon, it's clear that something is about to go horribly wrong.<br/><br/>To say much more about the details, however, would be to risk unbalancing a plot as delicately calibrated as clockwork. If you've read the book, you know what's coming. If you haven't, count yourself lucky, and watch with your heart in your mouth as events build to a climax barely halfway through."

","I loved this movie, and I'm not a 'romance' movie person (more drama and horror). The more I thought about it, the more I hated Briony the character. Atonement? Really? Wait until you are an old person, probably every person who could have benefited from the truth is dead,every single person, and now you write the truth? For what exactly? She waited so that anyone who could have cared is dead and gone and can't judge her anymore for lying. And her reason? To give them what they ultimately wanted? That's a pretty picture in her head to justify somehow waiting all those years to reveal the truth, when it really doesn't matter anymore. Briony knew she did wrong when you see her looking out the window as they took him away. To show them happy, 50 years later was it? On a beach? How romantic...and fake...something you conjure up in your mind to help you sleep at night. She basically killed both of those 2 characters within 4 years...nice. A jealous, nosy busy- body preteen whose actions killed 2 people and ruined more lives (the mothers/parents, brother, etc.), and is now confessing in her book as some sort of atonement, when she really is dying of cancer and needs to feel like it matters...well at this point it doesn't. The 'scene' she caught in the woods was consensual, but her cousin couldn't outright admit to having premarital rough sex, could she..so she also went along with the charade to look like a victim. But if Briony didn't accuse someone, no one would have gotten hurt, there just would have been a lot of hard questions as to what was happening out there when she should have been looking for her brothers instead of having fun with some guy she was attracted to. Good movie, hated how it ended,but I suppose it was appropriate. The only part of the ending that makes up for it is that I think Briony ended up alone all her life.."

","On the surface, this movie seems just like a normal tragic love story. But this story is actually well used in delivering a strong message. The painfulness of living with guilt, and unchanging love only causing hopeless yearning for each other is shown very well in this movie, through a heart-touching story, beautiful and desolate setting, and the great acting of the actors.<br/><br/>In this movie, the main character, Robbie is falsely charged and taken as a soldier to war, and Cecilia is left behind, longing for her lover, because of a single incident caused by her sister, Briony. Briony had the prejudice against Robbie that led to the problem. They do meet after a few years, but as difficult as it was to just meet again, it is not easy for them to start their relationship again. They promise to meet again, as Robbie leaves again for war, and they are separated for another several years, which becomes forever after all.<br/><br/>Even though Briony was the one who had falsely accused Robbie, she was just the spark that led to the tragedy. It wasn't wholly her fault that the two couldn't be together. It was the atrocious war, that destroyed love, families, and lives of people. All because of the greed of some people. The harsh conditions of the war, and the destruction of innocent lives is eloquently, and movingly shown. This gave me a strong impression, and made me rethink about the cruelty of war, and humans, ultimately.<br/><br/>The ""atonement"", after all, must not only be from Briony, who was late in her confession about her mistakes, but also for the victims of war. This powerful message, both about fallacy and war, that is delivered through this movie, makes it a must-watch."

Loved the actors in this especially the little girl, Saoirse Ronan, such a good actor at such a young age! Keira Knightley with her incredibly pursed face was good too and James McAvoy. I couldn't really get over the beauty of the cinematography at the start, Briony's blue eyes, the English countryside in the summer and the amazing castle they lived in. Incredibly well thought out story. One thing I didn't get from Briony was jealousy though which was supposed to be there, they maybe could have conveyed that a bit more. It just shows how quickly life can change and what someone's perception of you can actually do. I thought Briony genuinely 100% thought Robbie was a dangerous rapist but the fact there was actually jealousy in there and a childish crush makes a bit more sense. It also reminded me of The Great Gatsby, especially the quote, ""they're careless people."" I loved the ending too, how that part was in her imagination. So sad that she seemingly never got in contact with her sister again and she ruined her relationship with her when she accused Robbie. I preferred the first half of the movie to the second but that's probably just because I wanted to be there but just shows how different life can look after not a long time.

The Briony character is the one that causes me so much distress watching this movie because it was her false accusation that took away the happiness of others. Yet in the very end, she says: ""I gave them their happiness."" It's characters like Briony that makes a movie good and frustrating to watch.<br/><br/>I rewatched this again in 2011 and I didn't like the film as much as I remembered I had. Perhaps I was judging the film solely on its great ending twist. Or perhaps it's because I already know all the plot the second time I'm watching this so the excitement from the unknown is gone. Either way, I found the movie moved at a very slow pace. The middle part where Robbie was at war was dragged on to the point of boring.

","It's 1935 England. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is an imaginative writer who witnesses her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and servant's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Robbie is thinking about going to medical school with her father's help. Briony has a crush on Robbie. When cousin Lola Quincey gets raped, Briony's false accusation sends Robbie to prison. Four years later, Robbie is in France retreating towards Dunkirk. He has been released from prison to join the Army. Cecilia cannot forgive Briony (Romola Garai) who has abandoned Cambridge to do something useful as a nurse. Briony is haunted by her mistake as she writes her story.<br/><br/>This is beautifully shot and acted. It's worthwhile for multiple viewings. There are epic scenes like Dunkirk and memorably constructed ones like the fountain. It can be slow at times but it's never tired. The biggest change I would add is the important rape scene. I think it's important to show the man's identity to the audience. Here's the thing. It's not a needed mystery except for Briony.

Director Joe Wright, after revisiting Jane Austen in Pride and prejudice, goes for another period piece (this time set in pre-WWII England) taking McEwan's novel and the final result is just as provocative and moving as the book, but favored by ravishing costume design (that green dress worn by Keira Knightley is already a fashion icon), Seamus McGarvey's breathtaking cinematography, an incredible art direction and Dario Marianelli's captivating score (for which he won the Oscar). All these elements are perfectly assembled by Wright and help to create a bigger impact in the audience.<br/><br/>Wright relies on the work of Oscar winner Christopher Hampton ad whilst he doesn't derail too much from the original source, he achieves an emotionally compelling adaptation, that keeps most of the moral dilemmas pointed out by McEwan, such as how to make amends (and for how long) for something like Briony did? Or Is truly possible to forgive when the damage is too much? Briony's conflict is a tough one, and even though her action can be perceived as vicious and mean, she's not a bad person and as we can see she tries to fix things in her own way.<br/><br/>To play Briony through the years, Wright casts three actresses: the first is Saoirse Ronan (her Oscar-nominated breakthrough performance) as the young Briony, a girl enthralled by writing and whose imagination leads to the dramatic confusion that will cause Robbie's disgrace. Then comes Romola Garai, the adult Briony, the one who finally understands the consequences of her actions. And finally Vanessa Redgrave as old Briony at the end of her life, ready to end her atonement after living with the guilt all those years. All of them provide Briony's range of emotions with an adroit virtuosity. Also James McAvoy shines as Robbie with an affecting turn, we can feel his pain, frustration and anger, as he's sent to the war field and becomes a witness of the horror caused by it. And Keira Knightley offers a really mature performance as Cecilia.<br/><br/>Atonement is what can be distinguished as a beautiful ache: you know it'll hurt you, but it's inevitable to not watch due to its striking beauty."

","After watching the film, it's hard for me to figure out how exactly to review the film in an honest way. I do want to say though, after seeing the film, it made me want to read the book and that's saying a lot, because I do love reading books before movies (unless I didn't know a movie was based on a book to begin with, such as this one) and although the film was satisfying by itself, it made me want to read what the story was based on. <br/><br/>To watch an innocent, naive girl go through a series of emotions--infatuation, confusion, jealousy, guilt, etc is an emotional roller-coaster that I enjoy. The film is beautiful through the way it shows different perspectives--from Briony's to Robbie and Cecilia's. <br/><br/>The plot itself is tragic and heartbreaking and confusing in a lot of different ways and for someone who adores thinking and complex situation, this film brings that part out of me. It makes you question the idea of forgiveness and guilt and that's the type of stuff that I enjoy watching/reading. Anyone who enjoys something that causes you to think rather than just watching a film and just enjoying it--then this film is for you!"
"SimonJack","7","0","0","19 November 2015"," A good story of injustice unredeemed
","""Atonement"" is a movie based on a 2001 novel of the same title by British author Ian McEwan. The book and film have three parts, or they wind three stories into one. First, and no doubt the film's big attraction, is a love story. Second, it has a very well done war segment. Third, it is a story about a lie, a grave injustice because of it, and the tragic result in the lives of several people. This last is the wrapping that bundles the three together. <br/><br/>One synopsis of the book says it is about ""understanding and responding to the need for personal atonement."" It is that, indeed. And, it shows what happens when one doesn't atone. <br/><br/>At 13 years of age, Briony Tallis has a crush on Robbie Turner, the son of the Tallis family's longtime faithful housekeeper. Robbie is treated almost like a son in the Tallis family. He grows up close to Briony's older sister, Cecilia. Briony sees Robbie and Cecilia together in a very seductive scene at the large fountain pool. She later sees them together in the library. Some viewers think that she misinterprets this scene as Robbie raping Cecilia. I rather think it's a clear case of jealousy. Some earlier scenes of Robbie scolding her and not paying attention to her bear this out. <br/><br/>Later, the young twins in the Tallis home disappear, and everyone goes looking for them. Briony stumbles onto a scene in which her brother's friend, Paul Marshall, is making love to her cousin Lola. Marshall and Lola had been making eyes at one another since he arrived. Briony runs back to the house and reports that she saw Robbie ""molesting"" Cousin Lola. She lies to get even with Robbie, who no longer pays much attention to her and who is in love with her sister. In the film the family seems all too willing to accuse Robbie and not doubt or question Briony. They didn't ask Lola who it was. Robbie returns a short time later having found the twins himself and with one riding on his shoulders. The Family knows that Briony has a vivid imagination in her story telling. Yet they accept Robbie's guilt without question, based on her accusation. This isn't very believable in the film. <br/><br/>The truth doesn't come out in a trial, which the movie skips over. Briony would have to have lied again in testimony for the trial. Robbie is found guilty and sent to prison. Now the story begins to take on tones of Briony having regrets over her lie. Her conscience bothers her. She can't deny her guilt, or what happens as a result of her lie. But will she make atonement? <br/><br/>As time goes on, Cecilia splits with the family, Robbie is released from prison to fight in World War II, and Briony takes up nursing instead of going to Cambridge. Robbie dies of wounds while waiting to be evacuated at Dunkirk; and Cecilia is killed in a London subway station when German bombs fall on it. We see other scenes as flashbacks of Robbie and Cecilia and Briony. But these aren't real. Briony has made them up as a way to cope with her guilt.<br/><br/>The last scene is decades later. Robbie's mother and all the other Tallis people have died. Only Briony is left and she's now a famous novelist. At this point, Vanessa Redgrave plays the 77-year-old Briony. She is going on television to explain her latest book. It's a fictional story she made up about Robbie and Cecilia getting back together. In her TV interview, she tells about her lie about Robbie and its tragic results. <br/><br/>Briony lives all of her life with the wrong she has done on her mind, yet she has been unwilling to atone. Why? Atonement means to make amends or reparation to one harmed. That might be humiliating, and it's certainly humbling. But it's necessary for a clear conscience and peace of mind. She didn't make amends to Robbie and Cecilia while they were alive, and she could have at any time over those early years. She didn't atone after their deaths, while Robbie's mother and her own parents were still living. She could have cleared Robbie in their minds and hearts. Again, she had many more years in which to do that. But it would have been humiliating to her. So, she waited, and waited, until she was past atonement and humiliation with those affected.<br/><br/>One suspects that Briony was sorry more for her own suffering than for that of all the others she affected. She certainly wasn't atoning – because it was long after being able to make amends to those she hurt. Had she announced that all of her profits and/or her estate would go to help broken families or some other justice cause or worthy charity, it would be a different story. She might have had a statue made of Robbie as a wrongly- accused victim who gave his life for his country. But, there was none of that. Just her word that she hoped her book at this late time in life might bring peace to Robbie and Cecilia – who have passed into eternity. <br/><br/>Briony knew she was far too late to make any atonement. And although positing that she is honoring their memory by her fictitious book, she glumly realizes that her lie will be in her memory and on her conscience to the end of her life. Vanessa Redgrave's face in the last scene longs for peace when she will no longer have to live with her lie. For more on this, I recommend the 2008 documentary, ""Bringing the Past to Life; The Making of 'Atonement.'"""

","It begins like a BBC period drama with a high-society family taking vacation in their isolated country mansion. Then, it turns into a sort of English « saving private Ryan » and then it closes at old age. So it's really about a life testimony and this scope is well suited to the plot : fallout of a shameful act. I imagine the pain it is to drag such a weight endlessly and to be unable to correct things. What's is well done here, it's that the facts are told from different points of views and we can't say if it's true or fiction ! Beyond this, the feminine cast is really exceptional : young Saoirse, her mature version who looks like Natalie Imbruglia and for sure, Keira who proves with this movie she is an actress of amazing talent !"

","Atonement (2007): Dir: Joe Wright / Cast: James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, Saoirse Ronan, Vanessa Redgrave, Harriet Walter: Overwhelming period piece set in 1935 about guilt and the desire for salvation. An adventurous girl accuses a housekeeper's son of being a sex maniac after her cousin is raped. To avoid jail he goes to war where he plans to journey back. Director Joe Wright deserves credit for capturing the time period although the screenplay is slightly faltered with the information plot twist that plays as a downer. It does effectively play off the period for which the story takes place and stars actors that conjoin the ages effectively. James McAvoy plays the accused, with a torn reputation but a desire for reparation and survival in the hands of the war. Keira Knightley plays the woman who still loves him and defends his honor when the accusations surface. This is one of Knightley's stronger roles as she knows the truth in her heart but cannot render it. Saoirse Ronan plays the young playwright and accuser. This is a terrific start to what will hopefully be great things to come for this bright young talent. Then Vanessa Redgrave makes a superb cameo that ties things together. She is the Ronan character in her senior years where she can only right things in her mind to counter the problems she caused. Fantastic film about guilt and that traumatic road to making amends.

While I would have loved to see more of the relationship between Robbie and Cecilia, I have to admit that this is not the focus of this story as the title suggests.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, everybody delivers in a way to not steal the limelight but create a great balance.

","To get this out of the way: The music is amazing. Brilliant. It suits each scene's mood perfectly and the repetitive sounds (like the typewriter's buttons) have been very intelligently connected with the music. atsome points the music is incredibly annoying, which is just perfect.Congratulations to the composers.<br/><br/>When it comes to the story, I found some problems. The way the movie's main plot is set in motion is a bit too silly and convenient. It's also like the movie itself is trying to separate the first act from the second and third ones with, most notably, a different directing approach. I also got the feeling that the director watched ""Requiem for a dream"" one too many times before shooting the first act.<br/><br/>The overall plot is a bit predictable, but there's no reason why it shouldn't be. I enjoyed pretty much everything about this film, and I think that it's a really good one for its genre.<br/><br/>So, overall, the reasons it's an eight are: 1) The first act, which I found too convenient, 2) I find the film, the whole genre in fact, a bit pointless. It does not offer new perspectives, it's not really thought provoking, and it doesn't present a world we would like to go to or explore. ""Atonement"" is just one of those (quote-unquote) ""sad"" movies, however it's probably the best one. That's because of its strong ending, the solid plot (apart from the setup), the likable characters, the music, as already said, and, one of it's strongest aspects: the themes it explores. Not just love, family, war, and the like, but also some stronger and much less presented, like, well, you guessed it, atonement.<br/><br/>In conclusion, my vote for ""Atonement"" is between 7 and 8. I eventually settled to 8 because of the music."

The love story between the main characters is epic. I am not afraid to compare it with the epic love story of Titanic. Personally, I think it is even better. The feel is intensely real because James McAvoy and Keira Knightley showed it in their eyes. I can sense the sorrows of the characters. They achieved their best trying to live out the characters. I almost forgot that it was just a movie. I got overly emotional at most of the parts. I swear I almost wet my shirt because of my tears. It was just too emotional for me.

","I liked this movie because of the telling manner in which it highlights two important themes of life in the world. The first is the danger that is fraught in being judgmental, more so from a moral or religious standpoint. That was the mistake Briony made in being too hasty to judge Robbie. The second is how the beliefs and actions of one person can alter the lives of so many others. Briony ruined two innocent lives by her deficient understanding and action. Come to think of it, how many lives are altered by the stupid actions of parents, relatives, teachers and even people we do not know personally, such as politicians! By the same token, actions performed in the light of good understanding benefit so many others.

The sister of the accused, Cecilia (Keira Kinghtley) also has a difficult time. She's angry at how her family handles the case and goes off on her own to London. Here she's killed in the Blitz.

In the latter story, the three each have to do with the war and see the disastrous sights with their own eyes. The pictures are terribly realistic and I was creep while watching the scenes.

","I found it difficult to decide on how to rate this movie, so I felt obligated to explain a bit the seeming mediocrity that my six stars rating conveys.<br/><br/>Having just finished the book, I watched ""Atonement,"" eager to see the novel come to life. Realistically, a book of this magnitude, filled with such lush and lavishly descriptive narrative, would not fit into a two hour movie; it likely would not even fit into a five hour epic of the BBC ""Pride & Prejudice"" variety. That being said, I could not help feeling as though so much that made the book so remarkable was simply glanced over or not included at all in the movie. I wonder what the virgin viewer, who has not read the book, would make of the characters' depths and motives without having had the opportunity to read McEwan's nuanced character portrayals in the novel form.<br/><br/>That being said, I think the movie itself stands on its own rather well in spite of certain small liberties taken with the plot in order to make it a cohesive story that lasts the expected two hours.

","It's possible to consider 'Atomement' as one of Ian McEwan's most conventional novels; but with it's elusive plot and shifting perspectives, it depends very much on the author's characteristically precise prose to hold it together. Therefore, I had my doubts about a film billed as a ""romantic epic""; and indeed, there are moments when a little less in the way of lush, stirring music might have been a good thing. But for the most part, it captures the tone of the novel well, and through this, succeeds in maintaining its coherence (although the section set in France feels a little adrift). Overall, I feel much the same about it as I did about the book: it's a clever, subtle exploration of feelings and motives, yet it's almost as if it's lacking the climactic scene. I think this is McEwan's point; that in real life, this scene, as often as not, never takes place. I certainly preferred it, in both its forms, to 'Enduring Love', another of McEwan's novels adapted for the screen."

It was the second film of an up-and-coming director, Joe Wright, showing that Keira Knightley is more then a blockbuster star, and showing it's a good example of British filmmaker.<br/><br/>In 1935 in the country estate of a upper-class British family, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) starts to succumb to feelings for Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), a family friend, whom parents helped through school and university, but from a lower class. In the space of one day they finally give in, but their time is short. Cecilia's younger sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), sees the events of Cecilia and Robbie, but misunderstands what happens. Because of the events of her imagination and misunderstanding she ends up accusing Robbie of a horrid crime. After five years Robbie is serving in the army in Northern France. He had finally rekindled his relationship with Cecilia, who became a nurse and exiled from her family. They are separate when he ends has to serve in evacuation of Dunkirk. Briony (Romola Garai), now 18, gives up the chance to go to Cambridge, and trains to be a nurse. She tries to fool herself about what she saw but suffers guilt and wants to be amends for her actions.<br/><br/>This is a well structured, directed and acted film. It tells a compelling story about how a misunderstanding can alter the course of some people's lives. It also acts a commentary about class relations, with upper classes looking down on others, no matter how educated a lower class person may be. They is the ideas between truth and imagination, which could alter reality. It also offers a look on the British Army in Dunkirk, and war-time London.<br/><br/>Christopher Hampton writes a well structured screenplay, showing the different elements of the story, and with Joe Wright's direction makes it a well-crafted and does not tell it in a linear style. Wright shows his skill as a director with excellent editing, an effective tone and some brilliant shots. One true moment of genius is showing the British army on the beaches of Dunkirk. Wright would have been worthy of an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>There is a good cast for this film. Saoirse Ronan was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and she is clearly an actress to watch out for. Keira Knightley shows that she is more then Elizabeth Swann from the Pirates film or Domino Harvey in the awful Domino, she is trying to prove herself as a proper actress. She does a decent job here.

","Though not the great film some would have you believe, Atonement still has quite a bit going for it. For example it made me want to learn more about the Dunkirk evacuation and much more about the events leading up to WWII. Alas, this is essentially a romance, and the historical perspective and details take a back seat to weepy longings and misunderstandings caused by jealousy. The film looks terrific and the acting is more than satisfactory. Where the film goes wrong has to do mostly with its inability to sell the characters' motivations.<br/><br/>The story deals with a mousy tween girl accusing her older sister's lover of a sexual assault. From there he is sent to prison, and then finds himself serving in the British army in the early stages of WWII. All the while the two sisters have given up their wealthy lifestyles to work as nurses as the elder sister longs for the return of her beau. While the younger sister wishes to atone for her lie by saving lives and hopefully one day reconciling with the star-crossed lovers. As one can tell, this is the type of plot that grows inside a romance novel. Apparently the novel this film is based on is quite well-regarded. If that is the case, then I might suspect that much of that book never made it the the screen.<br/><br/>There are problems all throughout how this film is constructed. A viewer who doesn't let themselves get blinded by the sentimentality will question much of what they see. What on earth could be the little girl's motivation for seeing the young man blamed for such a terrible crime? And never speaking up for all those years to clear his name? Not realistic. The film seems to be channeling the movie Cold Mountain in some ways. We have two young lovers who hardly have much between them except a tryst in a library. And now, separated by war, the woman can only look to the horizon and repeat a phrase about wanting him to ""come back"". Silly. The first act seems needlessly drawn out and full of contrivances. The rest of the film feels a bit truncated trying to catch up the the present after the last few years of these characters' lives have happened off screen. What was prison like for Ronny? What was the fallout like between the sisters? Did Celia try to clear his name? What was his trial like?? All of these things could have made for some interesting viewing.

"lazyaceuk","8","0","0","6 January 2010"," Effective Quality Drama
","Joe Wright has presented a film that would sit comfortably in the Merchant and Ivory stable. It looks great on the screen, the actors accents could cut through fridge cold butter and the class system rules, OK ! I'm not a great fan of Keira Knightley but she is perfect in the role of the simpering Cecilia. Her upper class angst is well played out against the rogueish imp that is the role of Robbie, who is the working class lad made good, played by James McAvoy. His flawed conviction heats up the viewers satisfaction when Robbie and Cecilia are finally reunited only to find that a further ride is required on the emotional roller-coaster as an elderly Briony, Cecilia's younger sister, imparts the lie of the tale in the final pay off. I almost weeped myself. There are few faults with this film although the time switch and mix between reality and imagination in certain scenes is slightly disconcerting. This is especially so in the first scene of this kind where Briony watches Cecilia and Robbie having some very unacceptable behaviour by a fountain, which when replayed proves to be a different view on reality and sets the tone for Robbie's later fate. The mix between reality and dreams is basically the theme of the film. Briony's imaginings of her life with Robbie which leads to her spiteful slight on his character, which in turn leads to his imprisonment and through a chain of events, finally to a sad death in Dunkirk. Likewise the fate that befell Cecilia who, having obviously turned her back on a family who betrayed Robbie, probably would have continued to live a fairly steady existence in the country, finds herself the victim of an air raid. Even Briony doesn't escape. Although the novel, which is the inter film source for the actual film, acts as a final confessional before she leaves the mortal coil. Her death is nigh and also unpleasant in the form of dementia. Recommended for those who are prepared to stick with a film and watch it slowly unwind itself at its own pace. 8/10."

"yris2002","8","0","0","30 November 2009"," A passionate melodrama displayed with a strong artistic consciousness
","On the background of a terribly violent second world war, seen through the eyes of the young innocent soldiers, a story of passion and guilt is portrayed with elegance, but also strong intensity. A very good photography, together with close-up shooting, and the use of refined and impressive details (I can't get Keira Knightley's wonderful green dress off my mind) contribute to an effective visual impact. There is a taste for figurative art, for example the love scene in the library is, for a moment, fixed on the two lovers leaned against the bookshelves in a sort of chiaroscuro painting, passionate and refined at the same time. The handling of the whole story may appear too melodramatic, and unrealistic, but I think it is the result of a precise choice by the director, due to his conception of art, in terms of expectations from the public, and this is also evident in the final ""revelation"": the idea that the work of art, being it a novel or a movie, should provide the reader or the viewer with something unattainable in real life, representing but transcending reality, playing with time, situations and endings. Obviously, the moment comes when we have to go back to hard facts, and the last scenes starring Vanessa Redgrave (whose uncontroversial talent makes the difference) remind us of this. When she enters the scene the emotional and visual climax of the movie is reached: her wrinkled face with her wonderful blue eyes could speak by themselves, truly astonishing. The whole movie is very well performed, Keira Knightley playing Cecilia and James McAvoy playing Robbie are attractive and seductive by themselves and, when paired, spread pure chemistry all around. Also the girl playing the young Briony Tallis seems very promising."

","I had no idea what this film was going to be about, having heard nothing of the book and seen no trailers. What a pleasant surprise. This was a thoughtful and, at times, rather sad piece, with some strong acting. Keira Knightley's new lover is accused falsely of a terrible crime and carted off to jail, eventually ending up in the army during World War Two as an alternative to staying in prison. The film chronicles the breakdown in Knightley's relationship with her younger sister, who had accused the lover. The mood is pretty bleak at times and the film ends on a surprising note for someone unaware of the book. The sense of desperation experienced by soldiers at Dunkirk was well captured. Not a film I would traditionally go for, but well worth the time."

","I didn't think a film has been made to promote a trailer before, but if one was, this was it. Seriously lacking in the screenplay department, very little character development and a pointless kind of narrative drive that reveals itself in the end. I really enjoyed the first 1/3 of the film, but after it went off to war and then into a dream-like lala land, and then ruining itself in the end I found most of the information pointless. Now I'll be perfectly clear. I understood the meaning of the film, I understood it's called ""Atonement"" for a reason and that the character of the girl and her evolution was really what the film was about. It was really a story about her fiction and her guilt and coming to grips with it by making up another lie in a way, but seriously then, why not focus a little bit more screen time on the girl growing up then, instead of pointlessly following James McAvoy around for near and hour in one of the most mind-numbingly loud and obnoxious series of long takes I've ever seen. Every one says, ""Oh, the book is so emotional! Nothing could compare to it, no adaptation could come close. And you're right, but this movie, err...very long string of awesome cinematography doesn't come close to so many other of it's contemporaries. I knew I was supposed to feel something for all of these characters, but I just wanted the film to be focused more on them and less on the editor, cinematographer and director patting themselves on the back. I liked ""Pride & Prejudice"" even though I was dead set against it. I can understand why some critics would like this and compare to that besides the same creative team being behind both. But no one will remember this film. The trailer is the film. The film is the trailer. There isn't a whole lot more to say than that."

"MOscarbradley","9","3","8","15 September 2007"," A lifetime of regret
","In L P Hartley's ""The Go-Between"", a young boy in Edwardian England is sexually and emotionally scarred when he catches the two people he most admires 'in flagrante', having already acted as go-between carrying notes from one lover to the other. In ""Atonement"" a young girl of similar age is similarly scarred in a similar fashion having been 'emotionally betrayed' by two of the people she most admires. In both cases notes are involved, though the actions of Briony in ""Atonement"" prove more devastating in the end.<br/><br/>Although somewhat different in tone and structure and setting from the L P Hartley novel, (and Joseph Losey's subsequent film), Ian McEwan's ""Atonement"", (and this terrific film version by Joe Wright), moves very much in the same ball-park. (They would make a fascinating double-bill). Both deal with betrayal, loss and regret and quite directly with issues of class, (in both, the sexual relationship is between an upper-class girl and a working-class boy). So far, so much the same but while ""The Go-Between"" contented itself with the relationship between the protagonists and its fall-out and left it there, McEwan goes further.<br/><br/>It begins in 1935 in an England already preparing for war and after the initial events that set 'the plot' in motion, moves forward to Dunkirk and its aftermath; (there is also a coda set in the present day, something else it has in common with ""The Go-Between""). And the Dunkird sequences are neither mere plot contrivance nor window-dressing but a direct comment on the horrors of war, (Briony's 'crime' placed in a much wider historical and social context), and in this film version the whole Dunkirk sequence works in the most powerful and surreal way imaginable, (a tracking shot through the chaos is particularly stunning). Although seemingly divorced from the events that preceded it these two halves of the film work beautifully together and Briony's realization of what she has done in the past in superbly conveyed in Romola Garai's performance. Indeed, in a film full of great moments and perfectly sustained sequences its greatest coup lies in the casting of the three actresses who play Briony; Saoirse Ronan as the naive, uncomprehending child, Garai as the emotionally shallow young woman and finally, in a magnificent cameo, Vanessa Redgrave as the much, much older Briony, finally achieving 'atonement'.<br/><br/>But the film isn't total perfection. When Briony walks away from her reunion with Robbie and Cecilia I felt strangely unmoved just as the sequences in Dunkirk left me unmoved, (they are magnificently done but where, I asked myself, is the feeling?). In so far as it goes you can't fault Joe Wright's direction or the burning intelligence of Christopher Hampton's screenplay. Intellectually you certainly feel engaged but emotionally you may feel short-changed.<br/><br/>Perhaps the fault lies in the casting of James McAvoy who makes Robbie a very cold fish. (He is very good, however, at capturing the boy's cock-sure arrogance). But then the film redeems itself in its closing moments and the emotional punch packed into that final sequence more than makes up for what I felt was missing earlier. It could have been sentimental but Wright never allows it to trip over into such saccharine territory. And again this may be down to casting. Vanessa Redgrave is so over-whelmingly good in her final monologue she almost throws you off-balance. This is a great performance by a great actress even if it only lasts a few moments. Hopefully when the film is showered with Oscar nominations next February she will not be over-looked."

"Bevan - #4","5","3","9","28 May 2008"," A Potemkin movie top to bottom.
","I should at least start with what the movie does right. As many others have cited, the cinematography and settings are extraordinarily well done; plainly a lot of money and care went into that. The score is also evocative and is very well matched to scene, and the use of the typewriter as percussion is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is also very well cast, and the actors top to bottom do a very good job of portraying the characters and script they were given. Now that's aside, let's review: <br/><br/>The romantic leads have their happiness shattered by a jealous little snippet, and they never get it back, each dying in cruel fashion.<br/><br/>The molested girl marries her pedophilic rapist.<br/><br/>The aforementioned snippet never does, actually, atone, only coming clean when she's dying and has nothing left to lose, decades after the revelations would have done anyone any good, and even then has a problem with the truth.<br/><br/>You also have the constant flashbacks, some in near real-time, which after the first bit of Briony looking at the fountain scene are far more irritating than evocative; by an hour into the flick, we were downright scowling.<br/><br/>Toss in Titanic-esquire ripoffs like floating dead ladies, a few anachronisms (Lancasters in 1935?? Blowing the date of the Barham tube disaster? No constant strafing at Dunkirk?), and sorry, but another reviewer was dead on: the star-crossed-lovers-in-wartime thing has been done before, and far better. Of course the Academy fawned all over it, but I see no reason to do so myself.<br/><br/>5/10, and only for the things it did right."

","Visuals and cinematography are mostly what carry this film, although the acting is good. The problem is how much one must suspend one's common sense to be satisfied with this film. The main plot line for the girl, Briony, works well, but it's almost as if we see all the other characters and plot lines through a 13-year-old's mind (albeit a precocious 13-year-old). Adults act as if they were all characters in her play, a play with characters like mindless pawns rather than intelligent, educated human beings. The central crisis--that a 13-year-old's testimony would be sufficient to override all evidence of innocence and divert the authorities from considering other possible suspects--is just not believable.<br/><br/>A truly great film, like a great book, is worthy of being mulled over. Atonement fails that test."
"Tom-But","10","2","5","7 September 2010"," Die-hard emos, eat your heart out
","A person watching this film for the first time will not only be struck by the full extent of the monumentally heartbreaking, though somewhat consoling, ending, but upon watching for the second or third time they will find themselves unreservedly choked up and on the verge of tears a mere 30 minutes into the film, now burdened with the curse of foresight. Some may even wish, as film-goers often do during repeat viewings, for some minor and consciously impossible alteration in the film in hope of a different conclusion, perhaps a happier one, even at the result of a lesser film.<br/><br/>But, collectively, depressing ending and all, Atonement is an absolute gem of a production that spares no expense as an original and surprising tragedy, to be treasured greatly. What's more, it is certainly the best work to date of director Joe Wright, whose faithful yet refreshingly vibrant adaptation of the Jane Austen classic Pride & Prejudice in 2005 is surpassed by this incredible spectacle. He has, in what must have been a long, arduous and demanding process, not made one misstep in this romantic epic, beginning with screenwriter Christopher Hampton's detailed and intimate script, which successfully transformed author Ian McEwan's hard-going narrative into an intriguing, dialog- ridden film. Dario Marianelli's (the composer behind the Academy Award nominated score of Pride & Prejudice) award winning score is also a great quality of Atonement, often independently defining stages of the film and existing as a contribution to many scenes in its own right, at times a poignant orchestral ballad of sentimentality that plucks longingly at the audience's heartstrings, at others an eerie piano melody reminiscent of the X-Files theme song, laced heavily by a monotonously clicking typewriter that only truly makes sense at the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>Exceptional casting prevails: James McAvoy casts aside his broad Scottish roots to bring out an achingly pitch-perfect performance of the British, upper-lower-class Robbie, a young man whose youth, naivety and notions of love are all shattered by his false imprisonment for rape. In a suitable choice by Joe Wright, Keira Knightley (the lead, Elizabeth Bennet, in Wright's Pride & Prejudice) delivers well as the mature but still pensively idealistic Cecilia Tallis. She is, in the film's earlier stages, stubborn and aggravating in her attempts to snobbishly disregard her affections for Robbie purely due to his social status; once her temperament towards him relaxes, however, the tense, misinterpreted feelings of separation for her are in turn forgotten. A true performer is uncovered in the casting of 13-year-old Saoirse Ronan as Briony Tallis, who perceives and hence captures the true essence of a confused and impressionable youngster, often without even speaking, offering merely an expression or quizzical flicker in her eyes. She immerses herself in the role beyond even Ian McEwan's own expectations, calling her ""remarkable"". Thankfully, her successors at different stages of Briony's life (Romola Garai at 18, Vanessa Redgrave at 77) are just as well equipped to establish interesting and clearly developed aspects of this character's mysterious personality.<br/><br/>Finally, after alluding to the ending of Atonement throughout the entirety of this review, it would probably be appropriate to offer a direct synopsis of the conclusion: Briony, age 18, visits Cecilia at her London flat where she (as is Briony herself) is working as a nurse for the WWII effort. Robbie, having returned from an imposed service at Dunkirk, is there also. Briony has decided to make this appearance so as to be confronted about her misdeeds and apologise to them both for the trouble she has caused, hoping to quench her guilt.<br/><br/>(An interesting note: in an interview regarding Atonement, cast member Keira Knightley stated that, ""Briony feels the need to (relieve) this guilt she has. Whether or not she is guilty, she feels guilt."" Is it true, perhaps, that because Briony's actions were those of an unwitting child then she cannot be truly held accountable for her actions but still be expected to acknowledge these sins contritely and atone for them, as any adult would? Morality issue: what are the ethical parameters to which guilt is applied? Hmmm. Anyway) They both lecture her accordingly, Robbie more aggressively than Cecilia, and instruct her to undo the wrong she's done and clear Robbie's name by informing the authorities and anyone involved with the rape incident the true identity of the perpetrator. This holds with it its own complications, but the confrontation concludes on somewhat amiable grounds, although Robbie and Cecilia maintain that they wish to never see Briony again.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 60 years. Briony, 77 years old, has become a renowned author and is being interviewed on her latest novel which is semi-autobiographical and in fact to be her last work of literature, although she claims it is also conversely her first as she has been writing it since she was a teenager. The novel, Atonement, is then revealed to be the setting for the entire film so far, mimicking Briony's actual life in almost every way, apart from the ending. She divulges, restraining her emotional disposition as much as possible, that she never was actually able to work up the courage to visit Cecilia and Robbie to apologise. In reality, Robbie succumbed to septicaemia while awaiting evacuation on a beach in Dunkirk, and Cecilia drowned in the notorious Balham Tube Station flooding. They never were reunited, there love left unfulfilled.<br/><br/>But here author McEwan and screenwriter Hampton demonstrate some of the most poignant logic ever told of tragedy: no one could possibly benefit from this ending. What could be gained from concluding such a romantic struggle so definitively, so depressingly? And so, for the sake of her sister's and Robbie's love, Briony changed the outcome and gave them what they were owed, what she took from them. She gave them their lost time together, to love and be loved by each other, the way they truly deserved.<br/><br/>Now that's an ending."

","While it didn't hold as much power for me when viewed on DVD, compared to a theatre viewing, this is still an excellent work from director Joe Wright. I have read Ian McEwan's beautifully written, but nearly impossible to film, novel, and Wright really does an amazing job in bringing it to the screen. I have to argue with both camps who say its either about atoning for past wrongs or the perspective of the writer. Great works of literature and great films are rarely concerned with just one central theme- there are so many amazing parts to this film, and things to think about. The acting from an ensemble cast is throughly excellent. The young actress playing Briony got the Oscar nomination, but its Redgrave who really ties the threads together, and her appearance packs a huge emotional punch. That said, Romola Garai, one of my favourites, is unnervingly perfect as Briony, too. Knightley is growing into a better actress in leaps and bounds with each film, and McAvoy is the perfect Robbie.<br/><br/>I still think that the famous one-take beach scene is a piece of ""showy"" direction, but it doesn't really detract from the film overall. The film begins sort of like a Merchant-Ivory production (and I love those films!), with rich and beautiful English characters pondering over life while smoking copious amounts of cigarettes, which may be off-putting for some viewers. But it becomes something different entirely, and it really is wonderful. My favourite scene? McAvoy and Knightley's brief encounter in the tea shop. So poignant."
"Andy-296","5","2","5","9 March 2008"," Somewhat disappointing
","Despite the critical accolades and awards, I found this movie quite disappointing. Based on a novel by Ian McEwan, and directed by Joe Wright (who had filmed the latest movie version of Pride and Prejudice, much inferior to the BBC miniseries), the bulk of the movie occurs in a British country house during one day in the mid 1930s, in which a crime might have happened of might have just been the figment of the imagination of a fevered child. The main characters will feel for years the consequences of what happened that day. Since I'm totally uninterested on the life of England's upper classes, I was quite bored during a lot of the movie. And as if that wasn't enough, the final twist of the movie (in which Vanessa Redgrave has a cameo role) is totally insulting, and makes the viewer feels cheated. The engaging presence of Keira Knightley and newcomer Saoirse Ronan are among the movie's few assets. On the other hand, the much praised scene set during the evacuation at Dunkirk is very show-offy in my opinion."

","In 1930s England, Robbie is the son of a cleaning woman who has fallen in love with his mother's master's daughter (his childhood friend). On the same night where they reveal their love to each other, Robbie is accused by the woman's younger sister of a rape he didn't commit. Robbie is sent to jail and off to fight World War II... and for the remainder of the film, the two lovers try to reunite while the younger sister comes to term with the horrible mistake she made that tore her family apart.<br/><br/>Let me be honest up front: I had a very minimal interest in this film. I was mildly interested by its Oscar aspirations (7 nominations) and then I was slightly more interested when my friend Chelsea expressed interest (with whom I ended up seeing it). A chick flick starring Keira Knightley (who, to me, is a younger, classier Winona Ryder)? Not my first choice. Although, I went to go see ""I Know Who Killed Me"", so my instincts aren't always he greatest. Anyway, point being -- I saw this film half-heartedly and really liked it.<br/><br/>The beginning is really strong and interesting, and surprisingly funny. The involvement of a certain curse word (one of the more notorious ones) plays a big part and was funny in a somewhat awkward way. After the opening, the tone of the film turned decidedly darker... which you'd expect with a film about war and rape, I guess. Emotionally the film runs strong all the way through, working with loneliness and casualties of war (there's a scene later on with a dying French soldier that doesn't shy from showing the realities of war).<br/><br/>Worth singling out is a very long continuous shot (maybe 8 or 9 minutes) of English troops on the shores of France. We see troops singing, troops destroying jeeps, troops shooting horses and much more... to get this all in one shot is a major feat. The last long shot I recall is in ""Children of Men"", which ran about maybe 6 minutes but with much less going on to coordinate. The choreographer (or whoever) deserved the Oscar if anyone did, although in the end it only won a single award -- for best original soundtrack (which I don't recall as being a particularly stand-out score).<br/><br/>I think the film closed rather weakly after all the quality emotion (I can't really explain more without revealing things). But it's still a good film, only maybe losing a point from this closing. If you're a fan of period pieces or tough romance stories (this is no romantic comedy) this is for you. I don't know if I could watch it again -- it's good enough but a bit emotional. But I'm glad I saw it at least once and you should see it too."

Keira was not a believable as a young woman caught in a deeply passionate love for Robbie. She played Cecelia as if Robbie was a passing fancy and nothing more. I just didn't feel the passion in their relationship. So to me this was a boring movie. I could have done without the extra footage of Keira lounging around her vanity smoking cigarettes.

An annoying repetitive piano score, a constant mix of long and short shots (well, not constant but when it happened it was very irritating) and a script that's completely incoherent. The writers seem to have forgotten about a little thing called ACT 2. You basically have a very long opening act where you don't really get to know the characters, and then it just keeps ending, one drama after another that is supposed to affect us...but how can it? There is absolutely no connection between the characters and the audience. About the acting...James McAvoy was quite good (he confirms his excellent performance in The Last King Of Scotland) and Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave were decent too (although they got way too little screen time IMO). Keira Knightley however was terrible. I've never considered her to be a bad actress but her performance in this should've been better. She got such a big role and so much screen time and she doesn't manage to even affect the audience. A totally forgettable film I'm afraid.<br/><br/>To end on a positive note, I'd like to mention the great locations, one very impressive one-take long shot in Dunkerke (several minutes long), McAvoy's great performance and one scene that is very powerful and almost heartbreaking.<br/><br/>6.2/10"

","I just saw this film last night at a test screening in Chicago, and I must say that it was fantastic. The visuals and acting are both superb. The story is absolutely devastating, though there are quite a few bright spots. I really felt for all of the characters. There is one absolutely fantastic shot that goes on for nearly 10 minutes of Robbie walking around a British army camp. It really made you realize the absolute devastation that Europe was enduring. The scenes in the hospital are just as devastating. I more than likely will see this film again, not just because I am a fan of Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, but because it was a really high quality film. I highly recommend seeing this film."
"Redcitykev","6","2","5","9 October 2007"," 'Down from the Hill film' that is finally worth watching
","In my home town we have a phase for films like Atonement, and that is ""Down from the Hill"". This refers to those predominately middle class folk who come down from the top-end of town to make their 1 or 2 annual visits to our local cinema, and always to watch films like this. Past films that have fallen into this category have included such worthy, but rather dull films, as 'The English Patient', 'Gosford Park', 'Pride and Predudice' etc - ie those films that tend to fall into the 'English Heritage' mode of film making. This year's movie to satisfy their need is Atonement, but for once this is a film that, to my mind, is actually very good.<br/><br/>The film is very cleverly structured, and this adds to the understanding of why certain decisions by certain people are taken, leading to a train of events which pull you, the viewer, along to a quite superb ending - which I have no intention of giving away here! Needless to say the acting is uniformly excellent, especially from the younger members of the cast. The psychological side of the film is also wonderfully handled, and I felt genuinely moved by what I saw on the screen.<br/><br/>I feel sure that this film will do well at the Oscars - not that I pay any attention to any awards! - and for once it is a film that deserves all the praise it is getting."

","A touching story of contemporary tragedy is a great concept.<br/><br/>Sadly, this film just doesn't translate such a story well enough, failing in various areas so strongly that it managed to ruin the entire film's feeling for me.<br/><br/>The story progresses with a sluggish pace, and unwarranted jumps too often, detract from continuity.<br/><br/>Often, I felt the film was trying to force me to feel something, rather than immersing me in its story.<br/><br/>Often you are exposed to drama that seems to try to shock you, or move you in some way, but at the time it is out of context, then the film (ungracefully) jumps back to give context to the drama.<br/><br/>The characters gain context via these unwarranted jumps as well. But the film does not convey the feeling, forcing you to follow these jumps to tie everything together in the very end.<br/><br/>And even though the ending sequence is very touching and memorable, a lot of potential with very well rendered scenes, very nice acting just goes to waste through the sluggish story pace and the unwarranted jumps, forward, backward, true, false, better, worse.<br/><br/>In the end, I felt as if I had been bombarded with a sequence of incoherent feelings that just didn't tie up with the end result.

French was spoken in several scenes and the subtitles provided were of such small type I had to continually hit the ""stop-frame"" button and press my face toward the screen to read it. By the the time I got to the end of the movie I still was unable to sort out what happened. Too bad. Guess I will just have to read the book to figure out the story line.

Excellent adaptation of Ian McEwan's best- selling novel about an unlikely love triangle set in WWII Europe involving mistaken feelings, unspoken secrets, and the titular curse for its main characters. Newcomer Ronan is an amazing find as the young girl who turns things topsy-turvy for her older sister (Knightley in her best role to date) and lover (McAvoy equally good ), the well-to-do family's handyman when a communication breakdown sends the three into a decades long whirlwind with heartbreaking end results. Filmmaker Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton make the familiar storyline something bright and new (and surprisingly humorous and expectedly haunting) but the length is a tad padded particularly the battle sequences at Dunkirk.

"singingvenus","9","2","6","3 December 2007"," Stupendous Adaptation
","Having read and studied the novel a couple of times, I was curious, but also nervous about what I might encounter on the screen. I found the adaptation stupendous; it was clever, artistic, and complex. Rather than adapt the exact story, word for word, plot for plot, Ian MacEwen and Christopher Hampton astutely wrote a self-reflexive film that draws attention to its own fabrication. Just like the novel is formed by fragments of truth, history, and fiction, the film is a compilation of shots that continually reminds the audience that this is an adaptation. For example, the film reels in the background of scenes, the close-ups of eyes, the windows as barriers, the shutting doors: all these symbols serve to accentuate the film's positioning of the viewer as voyeur and to highlight the film's central conflict: misunderstood sight. This is, after all, not a love story, but a story about what we see and what we imagine.<br/><br/>The stunning cinematography contributes to the film's voyeuristic ideas  the movie performs the visual as the novel performs the linguistic. The scenes often move from light to dark, submerging characters in shadow. When colours are used, they stand-out as symbolic gestures (the luscious and exquisite green of Knighley's gown, or the vivid red X that keeps Briony's cape in place, but also marks her shame). So much of the tension in the film rests on the long glances shared by the characters, which reveal more than words. Hence why the resounding silences are effective, particularly in the library sex scene. The moment is hot in the book, but the adaptation is perhaps hotter. The decision to omit music and let the silence become the simple noise of tongues and breath makes this the most erotic and passionate sex scene I've seen on screen for years.<br/><br/>Moreover, the sound edits are synchronized with the visual, reminding the viewer that this is a story that is being created (the type writer noise) over and over again, which resounds in the refrain, ""come back to me"". Again, this isn't a love story  the refrain appears, on the surface, as the loving words of C whispered in Robbie's ears; however, below the literal reading, the haunting echo suggests the switches from present to past, from past to present. The layers produced by the movement from truth to fiction, present to past, hope and loss, is best illustrated in Briony's scene with the French solider. As she removes the bandage on his head, she metaphorically strips the rhetorical layers of the narrative. The story is too tight and her guilt must unravel. In addition, the solider lacks the portion of his lobe that allows him to differentiate between real and unreal; if at this point in the film, the audience hasn't clued in to the fictional fabrication undertone of the plot, it has done the movie a great injustice."

","Atonement (2007)<br/><br/>Wow, this is a movie begging to be classic. I liked it and wanted to love it for all the deep emotional implications, the great set designs, and the wonderful cast. The story is actually astonishing as it unfolds at first. It's about true love between two young adults, and it's equally about the fertile and misguided imagination of a girl who doesn't understand this true love and manages to sabotage it. It's also about storytelling, and about the ever-fascinating problem of World War II for the participants and the civilians caught in the riptides of its damages.<br/><br/>That's a lot. It's enough for any good movie, and this actually has the bones of a great movie. One of the strengths is how good it looks, mostly thanks to veteran cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, who has been on the fringes of a feast of awards but never quite rises to the top of the celebrity pile here. Check his list of movies to know his serious accomplishments, but mostly watch how he deftly makes this movie vivid and moving, scene after scene.<br/><br/>Credit of course goes to director Joe Wright who has moved from television to serious movie-making very well. And to the writer, novelist Ian McEwan. But beyond these are the actors, especially Kiera Knightly, who I find at her best here. She's often an affected actress, far to aware of the camera, but here she backs off enough to fit the tightly scripted style. Throw in Saoirse Ronan as the young writer and troublemaker, and her sister, the terrific actress waiting for her major breakout film, Juno Temple. And the one man to note, James McAvoy, is strong if not the equal of the others. (Never mind Benedict Cumberbatch, who is good but slightly out of step for some reason.)<br/><br/>So you see the movie is loaded for bear, as we say here in the U.S. (or used to). And it soars and swoops and makes your heart patter and your heart swoon. And then I think it's up to your feeling of how the plot unfolds, and whether you believe it or not, and whether you go along with what I found to be a bit pushy and contrived. Contrived to make you cry, yes, but so obviously you feel slightly jilted. Like the date who turns out to not really like you after all, and was just out for a good time.<br/><br/>Certainly give this a try. It might just be the best movie you've seen in a while. It won't be bad by any means. And it really is gorgeous in many ways."
"Chase_Witherspoon","5","1","2","30 September 2012"," The proud and the profane
","A comparatively poor but aspiring Doctor (McAvoy) seduces a wealthy young woman of class (Knightley) in 1930's England, but their budding romance is struck a fatal blow when he's framed for a rape. Lengthy and laborious effort doesn't really deliver on the hype, the youthful leads perhaps not convincing enough to persuade me of their plight, their sacrifices and the severity of the injustice done to them by the immature teen (Ronan) who manufactures the scandal that tears their lives apart.<br/><br/>The twist ending is welcome though a tad depressing, and the appearance late in the film of Vanessa Redgrave as the present day version of the Saoirse Ronan character is quality casting. But for me, McAvoy is too juvenile for this role, Knightley while apparently more age appropriate and able to perform both the regal and promiscuous roles well in tandem, needs a stronger, more virile and masculine leading man to properly establish her character's complexity.<br/><br/>There's some exciting war battles, authentic-looking sets and costumes, and while it's epic, the narrative is constant, but ultimately for me the dialogue sounded a little beyond the performer's capabilities in its unnatural delivery, and the overall impact was earnest but unconvincing."

","I don't know what to say about this one. A very twisted, pathetic, pitiful story. Not that I don't liked it, it was a good movie.

I really don't know what to think about it. Did I understood what happened? Did I really enjoy it or it's just my nature to not criticize so harsh a work? Did the story it's just that captivating and interesting as many others say? Or I just applied the ""sheep"" thing and convinced myself it was a good film based on others opinions?<br/><br/>These are my feelings for now after a half hour waiting, after seeing the movie to put all the pieces together in order to write my opinion. I understood the hole point of the story, I understood the story itself and what happened, but...I don't know. Maybe I expected more. What ""more"" exactly that is I don't know, 'cause in many cases (including me) viewers tend to like twisted stories, because they act like riddles. You love that sense of ""misteryous events that need to guessed"" feeling. But this one left me with a really ""blank"" feeling.<br/><br/>It took me a almost a half hour to decide what to write here, and almost three minutes to decide whether to give a seven or an eight to this movie. But in the end I thought seven suits the story more in my point of view.<br/><br/>Worth watching people, but aim yourself with patience and don't give up if it confuses you a bit, just pay attention.

","A quite faithful adaptation of Ian McEwan's most acclaimed novel Atonement. Christopher Hampton took the liberty to make some changes but they did not, in any way, affect the story and its tragic beauty. The direction and cinematography are out of the world! Joe Wright used his camera to perfectly communicate the unspoken words and the emotional intensity of the events to the audience. I felt totally absorbed in the scenes. Both Wright and Hampton managed to overcome the difficulty of turning words into visuals, especially when it comes to a novel that mainly deals with inner thoughts and personal perspectives.<br/><br/>Although I am not a big fan of either Keira Knightley or James McAvoy, I have to admit that their natural presence on the screen breathed more life into the story. Moreover, Saoirse Ronan's mature performance as the young Briony foreshadows a great talent in the making.<br/><br/>I also fell in love with the music score from the very first ten minutes!

"melgarcia40","Null","1","2","13 July 2011"," Not the easiest movie, but wonderfully executed nonetheless
","Atonement is not a movie who will please everyone. It is a complicated story, far more than a simple love story as it is sometimes described,it.<br/><br/>To me, the main center of the movie (well, of the novel actually), is the power of words. It's Briony's imagination and love for words that draws her onto this fantasy world where she does not make the difference between reality and fiction; it's Robbie's letter and use of the ""C"" word that will later turn against him, it's Briony's statement that sends him to jail, and finally, it's Briony's novel, which, in the end, allows her (or not?) to atone for her mistakes. It's a very powerful story which demonstrates how devastating words and miscommunication can be, and interesting take of what is or is not history, in fact.<br/><br/>There are many layers in the movie, and other subjects treated there: class warfare, war, and yes, a bit of how love can survive despite the events and distance.<br/><br/>From a direction point of view, the movie is very interesting, particularly the famous 1-shot beach shoot, which, in one and single take, captures the horror of Dunkirk's retreat and the feel of exhaustion and despondency those men must have felt back there. There are lots of other very clever shots and the image is beautiful. The score must also be underlined, rhymed by the ""tic-tic-tic"" of the typewriter.<br/><br/>Now, Atoment prevails essentially thanks to stellar performances from the whole cast, with Saiorse Ronan and James McAvoy being just incredible. Ronan, such a young girl there, perfectly captures Briony's confusion but also what really transpires in the novel, which is her desire to be a control freak, to be ""the author"" (in a way, the character thinks of herself as a God), and I can just praise SR for being able to convey so much on screen with this difficult character. As for James McAvoy, his performance is so, so good that I still don't understand the Oscar snub (a nomination a least should have been made). It's a very understated performance, subtle, nuanced, and so powerful each time he's on screen that you can't help but feel what Robbie feels in each scene. More particularly, the scene in the cafÃ©, the one where he discovers the college girl slaughter and the confrontation with the grown up Briony are outstanding.<br/><br/>Yet, Atonement is unfortunately a bit too slow in its middle section, and because of this looses part of his power up to the point that I get why some people called it dull at times. I had to re-watch it to completely appreciate it, and this is why it's only a 7 for me. Nevertheless, this is a movie that deserved to be watched, if only for its fantastic performances."

","I was handed the book by my teacher for my higher English exam and fell in love with the story then. So obviously I was wary of it being turned into a film, not just because it was one of my favourite books but because I knew it inside out.<br/><br/>Films are never going to be exactly like a book as they are two completely different ways of telling a story. This film is such a good adaptation; i love the film as much as i love the book. All actors suit the roles perfectly. And the feel of the book is not lost. The first third is meant to be a little faster paced, as it quickly leads up to Brionys accusation. The last two thirds are how each person has been affected, so are a little slower; these lead up to the last scene when Briony is an elderly lady.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful and moving story and the film has captured this. The long scene on the beach is a fantastic idea as it gives the viewer an idea of just how big and overwhelming the evacuation was. The jumping between different characters and different years was done brilliantly too. I could write forever about this film and what it is about, but there is no point as I would never do it justice. If you have not seen it....do!"

And it shows that when you make one little mistake(except the mistake made here isn't little), it will come back to bite you in the ass.<br/><br/>Briony Tallis, one of the main characters in the film, makes a huge mistake. I don't know how you pronounce or spell this young actresses name, but the girl who played Briony was fantastic. She was nominated for the best supporting actress award too. She probably deserved it. Not Tilda Swinton. Though that was a fantastic movie too. <br/><br/>Atonement is a romantic drama that takes place many many years ago.

"funkyfry","9","1","2","8 June 2009"," one of the best films of recent years
","This is a remarkably audacious and original film experience. Playing with typical ""period"" set pieces and devices before descending into what could only be described as a post-modern hell, it deliberately angers and frustrates the audience by not only with-holding vital information but by offering false information and later cynically dashing viewers' hopes by grabbing them back. Such an effort could be ruined by general confusion and mis-placed intentions if the entire film wasn't so thoroughly polemical and even critical of its primary characters. In the end, the film titled ""Atonement"" seems in some sense to be about the impossibility of such a glowing emotion, and the film's purpose seems to be to tantalize the audience with the possibility of redemption and peace while perpetually dangling it out of reach like the proverbial carrot in front of the mule.<br/><br/>The basic plot setup is as heartbreaking as it is simple -- a young girl of privilege named Briony (Saoirse Ronan) mis-interprets and mis-represents events which she has witnessed in order to frame a young charge of her father's estate (James McAvoy) with a rape which he clearly did not commit. His lover, Briony's sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) is left with an abiding bitterness towards her sister and her entire family for their class-based complicity in the frame-up. Robbie (McAvoy) enlists in the army to get out of prison, leading to a separation that tears the lovers' lives apart and leaves Briony (played in the middle section by Romola Garai and in the final portion by Vanessa Redgrave) without any outlet for her growing regret and self-loathing.<br/><br/>What's really profound about the film, in my opinion, is the fact that even Briony's relatively mature need for ""atonement"" is a form of self-indulgence. She can't live with herself anymore -- but why should Cecilia or Robbie care about that? What could she actually offer them, to make up for so much that she has taken away? As the film gradually reveals through flashbacks that even at the tender age of 13 Briony's motivations were confused by sexual jealousy, our sympathy for her character dissipates even as our sense of the overall tragedy deepens. The audience is driven further and further from sympathy with Briony, and yet we cannot for a moment doubt the sincerity of her desire to set her wrongs to right. It is the impossibility of this atonement, more than the lovers' sad fate, that really forms the heart of the tragedy. Even in the final portions of the film with Redgrave playing an elderly Briony who has now sought to give the lovers some form of atonement by giving them an artificial ""happy ending"" through her semi-autobiography of the events, we are subtly led by the writers and the director to realize that she has still never atoned for the evil that she did. None of this is by way of making Briony an inhuman or an uncaring person -- tragedy in its high and classical sense requires not simply sadness but the impossible longing for a higher character than we can achieve as humans. Briony did the best that she could at all times, but it was never enough to erase a decision that had already been made and whose consequences had already been felt.<br/><br/>The performances by McAvoy, Knightley, and Garai are particularly effective and memorable. There is never a moment where the actors and actresses put themselves above the material. The director's style is at times a bit showy, particularly in the Dunkirk beach sequences, but these scenes are so gorgeous and effective that any consciousness of the film process must be overcome by the sheer power of the images. There are a few scenes that seemed un-necessary or ill-placed to me, especially a sequence with McAvoy discovering slaughtered children in a field. But McAvoy's performance in that scene is so powerful that once again I'm inclined to overlook any kind of misplaced emphasis and to simply admit that what works can't be fixed. This is the rarest kind of great film -- a film that leaves us with a truly profound sadness, a sadness that is only enhanced by the beauty and grace of the proceedings. To think that we as human beings can reach so far, and grasp so little."

","The story of Joe Wright's film 'Atonement' starts as romantic and social drama in the setting of a 1930s high class mansion, very similar to the one of 'Easy Virtue'. The rich elder daughter of the owners of the estate Cecilia (Keira Knightley) falls in love with handsome and clever Robbie (James McAvoy) the son of the janitor and the two live a short and passionate affair which is brutally interrupted by Briony the young sister of Cecilia, a confused but imaginative teenager who misreads some of the scenes she is witnessing and sends to jail Robbie for a crime that he did not commit.<br/><br/>The next part of the story happens in Europe at the start of the second world war. Robbie has won his way out of prison volunteering to serve as simple soldier in the army, and lives the tragedy of war and the days of the debacle of Dunquerque. His moral anchor is a short meeting he had with Cecilia and the hope to get back his love and life.<br/><br/>In the third segment we meet again Briony, out of her troubled years, and starting to understand the evil she had made to her sister and her sister's lover. She renounced the easy life at the estate and studies at Cambridge, has volunteered as a nurse to do some good, and tries to contact her sister to get forgiveness and fix the evil she has done by recognizing that her accusations were false. But is atonement sufficient and can evil deeds be undone in real life? Or can imagination compensate for what destiny has decided to happen in real life? Is it actually destiny, or hazards and misunderstandings of real life that govern what happens? <br/><br/>It is the final segment of the story that will provide answers. Briony becomes the real hero of the story, with her permanent alternation between imagination and reality, with her tentative to take responsibility and get absolution from deeds she committed long time ago but which need to be with her for the rest of her life. The final key scene gives a different perspective to the whole story and this is probably reflecting the structure of the narration in the original novel. <br/><br/>There are two scenes of beautiful cinema in this film - the run in the forest in the first part of the film and the long shot scene on the beach of Dunquerque bringing to life the debacles of war - and the name of the director of cinematography Seamus McGarvey must be mentioned in this context. Out of a fine cast I liked most James McAvoy who brings to screen personality and charm to match the beauty and talent of Keira Knightley, and Vanessa Redgrave with a moving performance as old Briony, a role that fits her perfectly.<br/><br/>I did not read Ian McEwan's book, but the quality and intensity of the story can be felt in the script of 'Atonement'. Director Joe Wright uses a couple of times an interesting technique of playing the same scenes from the perspective of different characters, emphasizing the role of perception (real or false) in the story. As a viewer I had the feeling that this time we may be in the case of an adaptation to screen that succeeds to be true to the spirit and quality of a good book."
"sweetlittlepie","9","1","2","24 April 2009"," Heartbreaking
","I'm a chick, which means I love tearjerkers and this film is no exception. I wasn't actually going to see this movie, but my mom bought it along with Love Actually. They were both in an economy pack and it was really cheap and since mom liked both films' DVD covers she bought them. And so I watched Love Actually first which I didn't really care for. Then I watched Atonement a few days later, and this film just blew me away. I haven't read the novel so I can't compare them or judge one or the other, but I can say that this is one of those films that if you haven't read the novel you will still understand it because it is so well explained and told so brilliantly by Pride and Prejudice director Joe Wright. And from both films I can already tell he's going to be a high in demand director.<br/><br/>****WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS****<br/><br/>The story is about a thirteen year old overly creative girl named Briony Tallis, who is an aspiring writer. She comes from a wealthy English family. The year is 1935 and World War II is rapidly approaching. One hot summer day soon turns into a chaotic one when Briony witnesses an intimate moment of sexual tension between Cecilia, her older sister, and Robbie, the housekeeper's intelligent son who goes to the same University as Cecilia. Briony misinterprets this innocent moment and thinks that Robbie is somehow assaulting her sister.<br/><br/>After Briony reads a letter meant for her sister from Robbie, she makes up her mind that he is a sex crazed pervert who is obsessed with her Cecilia. Later that night she witnesses Robbie and Cecilia in the mists of passionate lovemaking in the library, she mistakes their act of love and believes that Robbie has raped Cecilia. Later when Lola, her fourteen year old cousin, is raped while searching for her twin brothers who have ""run away"", Briony is the only one who witnesses the act. She convinces not only Lola, but herself that Robbie is the rapist.<br/><br/>Lola immediately believes her as does the rest of her family all except Cecilia who maintains that Robbie is innocent and defends him during an interrogation with an inspector. But it is simply not enough to save poor Robbie from been prosecuted and sentenced to years in prison. When the war begins however five years later, Robbie is permitted to leave prison so he can enlist in the army.<br/><br/>The rest of the film consists of the troubles and pains that both Robbie and Cecilia have to go through after Briony's lie tears them apart. They fight to be together, but it seems like they are destined to be apart. Meanwhile Briony grows older and as she does she realizes the mistake she has made and is later revealed during the movie that petty jealousy was perhaps the reason why Briony made up the lie. Of course Briony doesn't realize until later that her lie has horrible consequences not only for Cecilia and Robbie, but for the rest of her family including her cousin Lola.<br/><br/>Vanessa Redgrave delivers a great performance, however short, as the elder Briony.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is that at the end you are left somewhat empty because we find out that she never truly realized the kind of damage that her lie caused, and she never truly achieves her atonement by not telling the complete truth and disguising it with something that makes her feel less guilty about what she has done.<br/><br/>This film has great performances by McAvoy, Knightley, and newcomer Saoirse Ronan. I am definitely looking forward to Saoirse's upcoming performance in The Lovely Bones. Another thing I love about this movie is the film score by Dario Marianelli.<br/><br/>If you like romance, tearjerkers and intricate story telling that this is must-watch for you."

","This film is a brilliant masterpiece that will allow you to appreciate art in film. It composes many elements of literary symbolism, and you will always find something new every time you watch the movie. The movie demonstrates cinematography at its finest, by the way camera angles were used and the constant movement of the cameras. Many people will not appreciate this film, unless they find the hidden meanings to certain objects and scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The film is a prime example on how we see things a certain way, and we think we know, but in reality what we know is the wrong thing. We learn that assumptions can go a very bad way, without clarifying our thoughts that are clouded by our emotions. Atonement is a must see movie. If you have not seen it, you can rent it at your local video store. It is like Poetry in motion."
"JackBenjamin","8","1","2","22 March 2009"," Mind of a Writer
","At the heart of each movie is the screenwriter, sometimes in collaboration with a novelist (pre-ordained studio junk notwithstanding). There are too many poor attempts at post-modern self-reference in film, but there are also too many critics trying to dig up that post-modernism where it never had primacy.<br/><br/>But this is a wonderful example of it done right.<br/><br/>As a natural writer Briony views ambiguous events in her childhood and shapes and directs them according to the compass of her craft (writers do this into adulthood, normal people stop in adolescence). Everything after the rape scene is her invention, and it adds a rich level of viewership watching and knowing that these characters' fates are entirely in the hands of a child. The narrative takes turns of its own, all originally conjured by a jealous mind (which all writers possess). A mind that couldn't accept reality as it was, no matter how ambiguous (all reality is), and so had to change it.<br/><br/>Halfway through though she overcomes that jealousy within her own story by abandoning her authorship and adjusting her own character to the mold of the people she's damned: by becoming a nurse like Cecelia, and giving up ""her place at Cambridge to do something practical"" just like Robbie. This is her real atonement: damning herself to the loveless life she created in others' names, a monastical sort of atonement. Giving her victims a fairy tale ending is just another side of that.<br/><br/>Some of the meta-narrative highlights that stand out for me are Robbie's dreams which occur in reverse slow motion, almost as if he's trying to undo the weave that he's been written into. The recurring imagery is wonderful and like a detailed rug it reminds us of the repeated patterns that make up the whole (submersion in water is probably the most critical for lots of reasons). I think all these images and themes coalesce in the single-shot sequence at Dunkirk, a remarkable shot -- ferris wheels, dying horses, drunken soldiers, repressive authority -- all icons of childhood or dying childhood, all at a critical point in the plot, all on a beach in which our hero is stranded, just as he is in the story.<br/><br/>It's no accident that the seed of this narrative tree is discovery of sexuality, the moment all real writers hear the starting gun."
"dsa_ca","8","1","2","6 August 2008"," A vibrant epic
","Jealousy and lie are part of almost all romantic tragedies, but the conclusion is that Atonement has carved out a niche for itself. Based on the popular novel of the same name, which swept many critical applauds; its movie version also manages to make audiences around to attach themselves with the character. The story of a lie, that dramatically changed the lives of people around it, will take you across a decade of human tragedy in Europe and the personal tragedy of the three protagonists. The strong performances by the all star cast lead by Robbie McCoy and Keira knightly adds luster to the already formidable written work. But a word of praise cannot be missed for the young Miss Ronan playing the character of young Briony Tallis. Her striking eyes and facial expression showing range of emotions along with a tinge of innocence shadows over every other performing artist in the rather long first act of the movie.<br/><br/>The story unfolds during the beginning of the 2nd world war in a large English estate of the Tallis family. The family includes a rather stressed mother along with two daughters, played by kiera knightly (elder) who is busy with her awkward attraction for the servant's boy Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) who has a hidden love for Cecilia Tallis (Keira). Little does he know that his harmless show of his desires for Cecilia would turn his life upside down? And off course the young Miss Saoirse Ronan's character Briony Tallis, which in the next two acts of the story, set in separate periods of her life, is played by two other actresses. In Cecilia's own words, Briony has a fanciful imagination, which threatens to destroy everything around her. Not that briony is a spoilt rich child, but she is innocent and also has feelings for Robbie, which creates a jealous trait as she witnesses Robbie locked passionately with her elder sister before a dinner gathering of her family to celebrate the arrival of the two sister's brother along with his friend, who has a rather questionable character features. As that particular dines begins, an untoward chain of events begins to roll, which leads to Briony witnessing a forceful sexual act over her visiting cousin in pitch black darkness by a unknown person. But as the entire days events take a toll over Briony she concludes that Robbie is the guilty person. Her one false claims leads to Robbie being imprisoned for four years and then later driven into France to fight the war. Knightely abandons her family and leaves for London to serve in the war as a nurse, while keeping her relationship with Robbie alive. As Briony grows up, she starts to get the feel of the consequences of her is mistake.<br/><br/>What transpires in the next acts of the film is the atonement Briony tries to find for her deeds. The movie moves along in swift pace after the first act. Miss Knightly do not have much of dialogues in the film, she rather makes an efficient use of her expressive face. Robbie holds himself and the movie strongly in many mono acts during his time in war. As mentioned earlier Briony played by young Ronan goes away with most applauds, while the other two actresses have very little space to evolve as they just end up taking leads from Miss Ronan. It is not just the three strong characters that make this movie worth watch, it is also the cinematography of the film especially prolong sequence of the Dunkirk evacuation which catches the audience breathless. In the end the movie does not deviate from its subject and concludes exactly like the fanciful imagination of Briony Tallis with reality firmly places around it."

","I can't say that Atonement swept me off my feet, but I do believe it managed to do something increasingly harder in a world with a less sentimental, or more cynical mentality: sell us a tragic love story without seeming too melodramatic or sappy.<br/><br/>I avoided going to see this film in the theater because I was convinced it will be a bit boring - I find sentimental melodrama for the sake of sentimentalism a bit passe, and I am not a big Keira Knightley fan. After seeing all the nominations and awards the movie got, I decided to give the DVD a try. Gotta say, this story of ill fated love (which is such common subject dontchathink?) could have resulted in a mediocre movie, had it nor been for the way the film was structured and directed, and the talent of Mr. McAvoy, Saorise Ronan and all others. Funny how talented filmmakers can turn even a common themed story into a great film."

","When thirteen-year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) stumbles upon her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) being embraced by the housekeeper's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) in the library of their country estate, it sets off a chain of events that alters the lives of every member of the family for years to come. Set in the English countryside in 1935 and based on the novel by Ian McEwen, Atonement is a tale of jealousy, betrayal, and the consequences of a lie. An epic of the doomed romantic genre, the film works hard to impress and has a few inspired moments but ultimately fails to completely engage. While it touches on class distinctions, it does not explore them in any depth and, though Cecilia seems somewhat more liberated than the rest of the stuffy clan, most characters are wooden and never come fully alive.<br/><br/>Briony, in an Oscar nominated performance by Ronan, is a talented writer who writes her own stories and plays, and has a crush on Robbie. She even jumps into a pool of water to test whether or not he will rescue her but the incident only creates resentment that boils beneath the surface. Her discovery of an obscene letter written to Cecilia by Robbie intended as a letter of apology frightens and confuses the young girl, though the letter allows Cecilia to realize for the first time that she is in love with Robbie. Awaiting the opportunity to present one of her plays at a family gathering that includes new arrivals brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) and his friend Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch), a wealthy heir of a chocolatier, she sees her sister and Robbie embracing. Letting her fears run rampant, she accuses Robbie of assaulting her young cousin Lola (Juno Temple) and the repercussions of her lie are immediate and far reaching.<br/><br/>On the flimsy and uncorroborated testimony of a thirteen-year old girl, Robbie is sent to prison and the two lovers separated at their most vulnerable time. Neither Briony nor Lola nor the real perpetrator ever makes a move to correct the injustice and neither seems to feel much remorse. Eventually Robbie is allowed to join the British Army as a World War II private while Cecilia becomes a nurse in the war effort. Before his unit deploys, the two lovers meet in London to rekindle their short-lived affair and she tells him that she left her family in disgust and tells him that she will always love him.<br/><br/>What was fully involving in the first half hour becomes a chore in the middle however, as the film loses its momentum and the promise of its exciting beginning becomes a lost opportunity. As Robbie waits at Dunkirk for a ship to bring him home, Briony, now a young adult, becomes a nurse caring for soldiers wounded in the war, hoping in some small way to atone for the havoc caused by her lie. Many years later, as a successful novelist, she uses the power of fiction to try and make amends but her guilt is not convincing and there is ultimately little catharsis either for herself or the audience."

Very disappointing. The story is a forced series of misunderstandings that seem very amateur and far fetched. I think the TV show ""Threes Company"" had more realistic misunderstandings. I suppose the blame to the lame story goes to the original author. But if I was to take the story seriously, it is really Roby's carelessness that leads to tragedy. The fault is also partly do to Cecilia's lack of relationship with her younger sister. Communication in general is important but is even more critical within a family."

But, hey, the critics sure liked this movie, both ""male"" and female, as they watched and whooped it up while drinking their pink ladies and bloody mary's in their hot pink feather boas and tights, I'll bet.<br/><br/>Of course, Brit females and girly men everywhere surely loved it, but I'll bet that most men of any nationality surely did not, and if any non-Brit male or female understood even half of what was said I'll give them money.

"Chris Knipp","8","2","7","16 December 2007"," Expansion
","Atonement starts at a great English country house on a hot summer day before the Second World War. It speaks of the attraction between two young Cambridge graduates, Cecily Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Despite their shared educational background, Cecily is upper class (her family owns the great house) and Robbie is the son of one of the family's servants, and out of this disparity comes a remarkable and rather tragic story in the novel by Ian McEwan which Joe Wrightwho directed Ms. Knightley in Pride and Prejudiceworking this time from a screenplay by the skillful Christopher Hampton, has made into an impressive movie.<br/><br/>The trouble with a movie that's a literary adaptation is that you may have read the book, especially when the book is as good as Atonement. Ian McEwan may not be a great writer but he's certainly a very good one. He writes delicious, intelligent sentences and with them tells surprising, quietly bold tales. The best film adaptation of a McEwan novel is Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden. The Cement Garden, it's worth noting, is haunting and strange and touches on one of the most ancient of taboos, but as a story it's simple in its basic elements. Atonement is many-leveled and far grander and more emotionally fraught, encompassing as it does the decline of a ruling class and a great war and themes of sex and love and class and the danger of ignorance and the capacity of literature to redeem a lifeor not. Filming this novel is an ambitious task.<br/><br/>McEwan's Atonement is a particularly dangerous novel to film because it's so easy to make the details overblown and lose the essence of the thing. This is what Joe Wright has done. He's still produced a beautiful, occasionally engaging and involving (but sometimes fatiguing) movie replete with moments of shock and sorrow and grandeur. But the book wasn't about wounded troops massed on the beach or an Underground tunnel being floodedthough these are among the more memorable images of the film. McEwan's Atonement really isn't about the grandeur of pre-War upper class English country life--whose details are just sketched in deftly by the novelist while he focuses on the emotions, the suspicions, the doubts, the passions. Nor, as one reads McEwan's novel, does one hear in one's mind the sound of large string orchestra playing with an incessant overlay of a loudly clacking typewriter. But in the film one never gets away from that. This is one of the reasons that novels about or from any period are timeless: the period trappings don't overwhelm, because we don't have to see them. <br/><br/>As Henry Green wrote, ""Prose is not to be read aloud but to oneself alone at night, and it is not quick as poetry but rather a gathering web of insinuations ... Prose should be a long intimacy between strangers with no direct appeal to what both may have known. It should slowly appeal to feelings unexpressed, it should in the end draw tears out of the stone ..."" <br/><br/>Atonement, the novel, is about the mistake of a naïve, willful, dangerously over-imaginative girl that plays into the class prejudices of a great English family and ruins several lives. These are events that at various points you really cannot stage at all. They're things you have to tell aboutor rather, hint at, and make the audience think about. Where the book is delicateyet disturbingtears from the stonethe movie is more operatic, and not always opera of the highest order. It may be Merchant-Ivory or Masterpiece Theater, but it's not Brideshead Revisited. As Beresford-Howe said in Film Threat, ""Imagine if the team that made The English Patient tried to make the same kind of movie, with even more brave-lads-fighting-the-Jerries porn and this time with Extra Added English country manor porn, and without really good actors, and this movie is what you'd have."" This is the sad truth. One wants to like Knightley and McAvoy and they've been excellent in other roles, but they aren't quite up to their jobs this time, and neither are the two young women who play the younger sister Briony, Saoirse Roman as the eleven-year-old girl who makes the false accusations, and Romola Garai as the repentant eighteen-year-old. Briony is central. She needs to be infuriating, yet sympatheticwhich isn't so easy, and neither actress quite has those qualities. There is a great actress at the end in Vanessa Redgrave, with her immense authority and wisdom, as the aged, soon-to-die Briony, who appears in one speech to a TV interviewer about her latest, and last novel, which is called Atonement. But this is just last-minute exposition and since the message is one of failure and quiet despair, it's not the grand finale the elaborately staged scenes have led one to expect. Too much of the movie's time is thrown away on great paneled hallways and country house lawns, bright lipstick, period hairdos, silk blouses, little boys talking as little English boys no longer do, and haggard battle scenes that could as well be of the First World War as the Second.<br/><br/>I don't side with those who think the vast scene of troops on the beach is a mere tour de force without emotion. Well, maybe it is, but it's still the most mesmerizing sequence in the movieperhaps it's involving because we don't know where it's going to go. And ultimately, pointless or not, the post-battle sequences are the closest thing we get to an objective correlative for the human tragedy the young girl has wrought. Other scenes, which can be evoked in a few lines in the novel, are so elaborately staged they overwhelm the ideas McEwan meant to evoke. We don't need to see that Underground flood. It's far more affecting just to learn what happened without seeing it. McEwan's novel isn't perfect, it's too manipulative, but it's a better story."

","After Atonement received almost unanimously excellent reviews a female friend  who had read the book - and I went off to our local fleapit to judge it for ourselves. In a cinema which was only about one eighth full I guess it was inevitable that a couple would plonk themselves right behind us. The man immediately displayed his credentials. As a trailer for 'The Kingdom' came on, he pronounced in a very loud voice, ""Well, that's a load of FXXXing propaganda!!"", and then continued to denounce every other item  including the adverts  in a similar fashion. Rather optimistically, I hoped he might quieten down for the main feature. It was not to be. 'Atonement' is one of those rather precious British productions which wear their literary credentials on their sleeves. One can admire the beautifully realised images of a sweltering hot English summer; the restrained acting which subtlety highlights the unspoken class structure that permeated through British pre-war society; the way Madden overcomes the non-linear complexities of the novel by using such clever techniques as the clicking of the typewriter as a joining mechanism. Unfortunately this also means that the overall effect can feel rather difficult, slow and dull. Obviously our friend behind us felt this to be so. Almost from the beginning, he shifted and shuffled in his seat, punctuating it all with low grunts, groans and barely suppressed yawns. Finally, as the revered tracking shot unfolded before us, he blurted out, ""God, this is boring!"" In an unexpected turn of events, however, my normally very well-balanced friend had also had enough. Violently jerking round and in a venomous whisper that would have caused Gollum to take a step back, she spat out, ""Well, why don't you p*** off then!"" Silence. This meant that the films' rather special cinematic representation of the chaos of Dunkirk was diminished by the fact that at any time we could have been embroiled in a real life fight. Anti-climatically, the couple quietly got up and left. So, what of the film? In retrospect, although very classily made, Atonement is actually less than the parts. The first section is too reminiscent of 'The Go Between' and the War scenes, although brilliantly realised are not creating new ground. It was well acted, especially Saoirse Ronan as the 13 year old Briony. Even Kiera is fine  although, as my friend pointed out, she works in the part as it calls for someone who is stilted and wooden (God, women can be far crueller than men you know). But in the end? Maybe our vocal friend had a point."

","I very much enjoyed the look and feel of this movie but for it to be a masterpiece requires being emotionally invested in it, which I was not.<br/><br/>The romance between the two leads was unconvincing (perhaps in the book it was better). Also it was not clear to me whether Briony knew she was lying about Robbie being the rapist or actually believed it was him. If she believed it than she did nothing wrong (hence nothing to atone for). But even if she knew she was lying, I had no sympathy for the lovers so didn't really care. Both of them knew this young girl had read a sexually explicit letter and caught them having sex but said absolutely nothing to her to explain what was going on and reassure her that it was alright.<br/><br/>Another reviewer called this a middle class drama. And that ultimately is what keeps me from really connecting with this movie. It is not tragic enough to be a tragedy (or more accurately tragedy is now too common to be tragic).<br/><br/>Finally, whoever made this movie was either financed by Phillip Morris or has a massive smoking fetish. There must have been 30 full minutes of people smoking in this movie with it seemed like about 20 light-ups. Although this smoking frequency may have been true to the time I found it extremely distracting."

","It is such a rarity, but such a delight, when an accomplished novel is successfully transcribed to the screen. I was enormously impressed by the exquisite prose of Ian McEwan's work ""Atonement"" and anxious about how it would fare as a movie, but the result is a triumph. Director 35 year old Joe Wright - whose only previous direction was the most enjoyable ""Pride And Prejudice"" - and screenwriter Christopher Hampton (helped by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey) have crafted a fine adaption which is faithful to the novel but makes impressive use of the film medium to give us a new insight into the work.<br/><br/>At one level, this is an achingly poignant love story centred on the upper class Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley in one of her best performances to date in a role where her thinness is actually appropriate) and the son of the family's cleaning women Robbie Turner (James McAvoy in a richly textured offering with no hint of his natural Scottish brogue). But, at an another (deeper) level, this is a narrative of betrayal and atonement by Cecilia's younger sister Briony - played successively by Saoirse Ronan as the pubescent and overly-dramatic 13 year old, by Romola Garai as the tortured 18 year old, and by screen legend Vanessa Redgrave as the 77 year old author.<br/><br/>No film can replicate or emulate the prose of a novel but ""Atonement"" the movie scores in other ways: an incessant and insistent typewriter-laden score, detailed invocation of period clothing and settings, repetition of crucial scenes from different viewpoints, a sharper, clearer and more emotional ending, and - above all - a stunning, lengthy steadicam shot of the hell on earth beach scene at Dunkirk. This is almost as good as cinema gets."
"bedtimereviews","10","1","3","29 July 2015"," Masterpiece. Oustanding.
","Tonight I watched for the fourth time the film Atonement based on the book with same title written by Ian McEwan. I remember the first time I watched this film. It was winter of 2007 and I had gone to the cinema with my sister and our parents.<br/><br/>The film came to an end and I remember myself not wanting to leave the room. It was the first and only time I felt like that. Even though I was so young, I felt so enchanted and heartbroken that I didn't want to leave the room until I don't know what.<br/><br/>This film is about forgiveness. The main characters are three young people. Cecilia, Robbie and Briony. Cecilia and Briony are sisters with the first being some years older than the other. Robbie is a young man to whom both sisters feel attracted to. But when by mistake Robbie gives Briony a letter to forward it to her sister, in which he admitted in a vulgar way that he wanted her, Briony feels betrayed by both Cecilia and Robbie and takes the decision to destroy both of their lives by testifying false that she saw Robbie molesting on her cousin Lola.<br/><br/>Police arrested Robbie and gave him the choice: Prison or Army. He chose army.<br/><br/>As years past Cecilia grew up to become a nurse and Briony was being prepared to join University but in the last minute she decided to become a nurse too, thinking that this was the only way she could help and in someway erase part of what she had done some years ago.<br/><br/>The film follows the lives of the three people. Robbie facing the cruelty of war, Cecilia helping in any way she can the soldiers and Briony never having forgotten of the awful thing she had done. Just before the end we see Cecilia and Robbie in their home living a happy life after war with him still facing some difficulties, and Briony visiting them to apologize which apology was never accepted.<br/><br/>And at the very end we see an old woman giving an interview. She's Briony Tallis the well known writer who gives an interview regarding her latest novel ""Atonement"". As she explains the end of the book is imaginary because Cecilia and Robbie never met again after the arrest. They both died, some days apart and this book ,as she says, has a happy ending not because she wants to lie to people but because she wants to give the two lovers the ending they deserved but never had because of her.<br/><br/>This film is truly a masterpiece. I wouldn't have watched it four times if it wasn't. And for the first time I feel that the film is better than the novel. Keira Knightely and James McAvoy are OUTSTANDING. They give the passion and tension their characters deserve. I give this film 10 out of 10 stars. There is not a single thing I didn't like or I would change. This film makes me cry every single time not so much because of the two lovers who didn't have the chance to enjoy their youth and love but because Briony lived a life in guilt. She was responsible for destroying two peoples lives and not only that. She never had the chance to do the right thing. And after the end she dies with her memory faded from some disease. And now I'm thinking of it, maybe that's a gift given to her because she had felt truly sorry. The gift was that she would for once feel innocent and kind. Having forgotten of what she did. She dies."

","A mainly glum, disturbing, and strangely creepy fiction of doomed romance. In one of the features on my disc, one of the participants describes the house, which is a character, as creepy. I haven't read the book, or any of McEwan's tales, but this depressing story could be his self-addressed excuse for telling porky pies, and makes him feel better. Many (most ? all ?) gloomy writers make use of other people's misfortunes, and their own, when creating their fantasies. Perhaps they sometimes even create these misfortunes themselves.<br/><br/>The way the narrative is filmed continually reminds us that a lot of it, perhaps all of it, is not actually happening: this socially divisive love story is end-to-end imaginary. That must be why it rambles over the place. The narrative is intercut with puzzling flash-forwards, anticipating later events. Did Briony actually see two figures clutching at each other on the library ladder? Or did she just make it up in her embryonic little scribbler's head ? The bookish setting, suspended among stacks of literature, is appropriate. All art is unreal, if you will; but there are degrees of unreality. In this case the reality of English interwar types (Cambridge or Oggsford men) during the mid-1930s is quite distancing, even though I was sufficiently alive myself to recall the run up to WW2. This distance annoys and clouds. Still, the package is not uninteresting, very well-made, well-dressed, well-acted, and all that. Seemed like an excessive amount of time at Dunkirk. Was Dunkirk really like that ? I can't quite believe it. There really are rather too many plot holes, and I had one question. Why didn't the young redhead, Lola, come clean ? However, this has been more or less answered on this site. She was out to snare a chocolate millionaire, no matter how creepy. I was going to give this eight, but now it's seven."

","Atonement is a romantic and war film directed by Joe Wright. It is a film adaptation of the novel of the same title by Ian McEwan.The story is about a mischievous girl accuses her older sister's lover of a crime he did not commit, only to find that her words have irrevocably and permanently changed the lives of all involved.The film stars James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, and Saoirse Ronan together with Romola Garai,Vanessa Redgrave,Juno Temple and Benedict Cumberbatch.<br/><br/>The year is 1935, and as the summer heat takes hold, 13-year-old fledgling writer Briony Tallis watches her older sister, Cecilia, get undressed and go frolicking in the garden fountain on her family's country estate. The housekeeper's son, Robbie, a childhood friend and recent Cambridge graduate, also witnesses the innocent act. When Robbie and Cecilia subsequently cross a particularly sensitive boundary and the scheming Briony accuses Robbie of an unspeakable transgression for which the boy is wholly innocent, the repercussions of her unfounded claim threaten to affect all three for decades to come.<br/><br/>This movie is an epic, grandiose, and immensely sad film.It is an extremely well crafted, visually rich love story set during a tumultuous time of war, where two impassioned characters are forever torn apart by the selfish jealousy of another.Also,it has strong performances from James MacAvoy and Keira Knightley,a brilliant cinematography, and a unique score.It is definitely one brilliant film that ever came out."
"hellraiser7","10","1","3","23 June 2012"," Lost Romance
","The meaning of atonement is always ones quest for redemption, forgiveness and salvation for others, no matter how long it goers on even a lifetime it is an important mission that must always be complete for the happiness of others as well as ones own.<br/><br/>This film is one of the most emotionally moving and tragic film's I've ever seen. Joe Wright whom directed ""Pride and Prejudice"" (film I love and previously reviewed) knows how to make a romance film right.<br/><br/>The theme in the film is about lost romance. A romance that gets robbed by two people Robie Turner (flawlessly played by James McAvoy) and Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightly equally brilliant)that obviously deserve and belong to each other, both have done no wrong except love each other. All of this because of one grave misunderstanding by one person Briony Tallis (played at different ages by Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave) and as we see all three try to reclaim that lost romance, but it is tragically out of reach.<br/><br/>One of the brilliant things about this film is how we see the film is broken up into split focus which creates that sense of mystery throughout the film and makes the drama all the more emotional. We get down tot he perspective of Cecilia and Robbie. We just love both of these characters. Cecilia is just a bit stuck up but in a good way, spunky, constantly has criticism that can be a bit unforgiving, but has a sense of warmth to her. Robbie we see is like your usual good guy; he's an underdog, has a dry charismatic charm, a bit on the shy side but never short of courage when it comes to feelings. We can see despite class and character differences their right for one another, and personally I feel that's part of what love is it shouldn't matter who a person is whether in class, race, religion, or any other feature it's the feelings both share for one another that matter. The scenes with them are in a way blissful and beautiful, even the shots of that countryside really reflect the innocence of the romance between the two. The fountain scene we see both are exchanging romantic tension and banter, it seems like arguing Celilia is constantly trying to get a rise out of Robbie while Robbie teases her a bit, it's obviously this interplay has gone on for some time, I can't help but sense Ceilia might have had a crush on him since childhood well that's my theory anyway. We know from the way they look at one another throughout the ordeal that in reality they have deep feelings for one another, once Cecilia is soaked and both look at one another their fate is already sealed. It was also great when we saw another scene with them, when Cecilia got the wrong letter Robbie wrote, Robbie as he's coming to see her tries to apologize it's just funny from how nervous he is. But of course Cecilia does believe him and this leads to a scene I thought was romantic and erotic.<br/><br/>It was just sad and unfair when we see their romantic interplay robbed as both get torn away and of course we see both are trying to come back together. From Robbie in the war, resulting in some brilliant shots which add to the emotional weight, one shot which was memorable to me was seeing Robbie go down a bunker and see there is a French romance film playing, he looks at it and of course cries because he feels that Cecilia and their future together after the war could be further out of reach.<br/><br/>The of course we would see things unfold in Briony's point of view which as we see is not completely reliable. The truth is presented to us but not the whole truth, because she never sticks around long enough to get all of the facts. Like a fountain scene she mistakenly thinks it's Robbie being rude in a way to her sister, but may'be just a bet if jealously intermixed since Briony herself has a crush on him. Her interpretation of that incident is unreliable because we can't hear anything from where she's positioned plus there is some time that's missing, this weakness of course leads to the downfall in Robbie, Cecilia, and herself, making her feel misery for her own grave sin.<br/><br/>What is missing from her point of view makes this all the more sadder because it reflects Briony's life and quest which is incomplete throughout the film. Like when she goes to a wedding, we don't see who they are, most of that wedding we see a shot of how Briony is viewing it, it's a wanting look she wishes this was Cecilia and Robbie's wedding which it really should of been.<br/><br/>It all comes down to the final part of the film which always breaks me heart, when we see Vanessa Redgrave's appearance as an elder Briony, I'll just say what she says at the end will haunt you forever.<br/><br/>Robbie and Cecilia will live in my heart forever, even I want to believe their romance has returned.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","""Yes. I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.""<br/><br/>It's past time I wrote a proper review for Atonement, as it's am excellent movie in all aspects and a personal favorite of mine.<br/><br/>I'm quite the fan of Joe Wright. He's talented enough to make Pride & Prejudice into a movie that both guys and girls could enjoy, and pairing him with Keira Knightley again for another historical piece is basically a guarantee for success. The man knows how to craft a good drama.<br/><br/>The first thing I love about Atonement is the cinematography. From the opening portions in the beautiful English countryside, to wartime London and the British evacuation at Dunkirk, this is a startlingly beautiful movie. Not a moment passes by without something eye-catching in the frame. From the settings to the costumes, it's a cinematic showcase.<br/><br/>Second, the cast is outstanding. This was the movie that made Keira Knightley one of my five favorite current actresses, and made me a fan of James McAvoy. It was also the movie that proved that Saoirse Ronan is easily the best actress of her age. All three actresses who played Briony at different ages were good, but Ronan had the task of defining the character for the other two women, as well as the most challenging role in the movie. Her Academy Award nomination was completely deserved, especially for one so young.<br/><br/>Third, this is an excellent adaptation of an excellent book. It's a movie that easily could have seemed disjointed because of the way it switches time periods, settings, and tone, but every part of it works and flows together. The changes from period drama to war film and back to drama are pulled off flawlessly.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think very highly of Atonement. Any time a movie takes a genre that I'm not a huge fan of and MAKES me a huge fan, I'm impressed. It has something for almost everyone, and it's just a well-crafted film. Check it out, even if this kind of thing isn't normally to your taste."

A Lancaster bomber flies over. That plane first flew 4 years later in 1941. 2. There's a scene where the bad guy discusses marketing a new brand of candy,using language straight out of the 1990s. 3. There are no Germans at Dunkirk! The Brit soldiers sing hymns and bawdy songs untroubled by a single artillery round or dive bomber. 4. In a key scene the leading lady needs to retrieve something from a fountain which holds about a foot of water. She could have just reached in and grabbed it. But it turns out to be about 6 feet deep so she has to semi-strip and dive in. 5.

","Just brilliant, started off a bit weirdly, but got better an better as it went on. It was so beautifully written. It did get a little confusing with all the time-jumps but all becomes clear towards the end before the final really emotional scene. I don't think I've ever cried so much at a film in my life. James McAvoy and Kiera Knightley are totally believable and are so good together in this film it actually seems real. But the plot is so deep it's only sort of half-way through when you begin to realise that the film is not in fact about them but about her sister. By the time the end came along I was staring open-mouthed at the screen just not believing that this is how they would end it, it was the perfect ending for what the film's about. And the scene at the Normandy beach is superb too. Liked it so much more than No Country for Old Men, this should have won the Ocsar."

","Atonement is the most recognized film to date by director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice). Set in Britain in the time before and during the Second World War, Atonement comes across as a story about guilt, love and chaos. <br/><br/>Bryone Tallis, a 13 year old girl comes to realize that she may have reached the end of her childhood. However she still lives according to her imagination. One night she sees her older sister, Cecilia and her childhood friend, Robbie, together in the library and after reading a forbidden letter, Bryone's naive mind leads her to take the wrong conclusions. When her cousin is attacked, Bryone accuses Robbie and that decision changes the family's lives forever. Robbie is forced to fight in the war, Cecilia becomes a nurse and gets away from her family and Bryone chooses to do the same over going to Cambridge and has to live with her crime for the rest of her life. <br/><br/>This film deserved all the acclamation it received. It's one of the most brilliant adaptations in recent cinema history. It's very faithful to the novel, which is not an easy task since a lot of it is developed inside the character's minds. The director found a very ingenious way of translating this aspect to screen: the soundtrack. During the course of the film, we don't ever hear any thoughts, but we know exactly how the characters feel and that's due to the brilliantly placed music. The casting is almost flawless. Most of the characters are very truthful to their description on the novel, and some great performances make them very close emotionally to the novel. The only exception goes to Keira Knightley and her approach to Cecilia. In the book, she is warm, nice and caring, which is a contrast to the cold and snobbish woman we see on screen. She is the worst miscast. On the other hand, James McAvoy gives a spellbinding performance as Robbie, and the actresses playing Bryone do a wonderful job. The veteran Vanessa Redgrave captures perfectly the quiet desperation the character feels towards the end of her life. Another great achievement is the visuals of the film. The scene on the beach where Robbie and two of his fellow soldiers are walking among all the chaos is astonishing, as it's how closely they managed to portrait Bryone at all stages of her life. <br/><br/>Overall, Atonement is no less than a masterpiece. It works as a brilliant adaptation, but it also stands on its own. It's impossible not to be affected at some degree by the film, whether it's for its love story,the chaos of the war or the desperation of guilt. Although it didn't have a place at the Oscars, it will certainly be a reference in the coming years."

","That's a fitting description of this over-hyped film. Apparently, period clothes, war & scenery are good substitutes for a solid story. Beautiful scenery & cinematography, but ultimately Atonement does not deliver what all the critics say it does.<br/><br/>It doesn't have much substance. If you watch it carefully, you'll see what I mean. The story's main factors are the supposedly heartbreaking separation of two young people & the atonement for the one responsible for it. However, we're never really shown that they are in love. It seems as if they're merely horny teenagers. Ironically, Robbie rightfully states at one point that all they had were a few moments in a library.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Ian McEwan, Atonement revolves around the wealthy Tallis family & a horrible incident one summer. Briony (Saorise Ronan) is a precocious 13-year-old with ambitions for a writing career. She has a crush on Robbie (James McAvoy), the family's servant boy. Cecilia (Keira Knightley) is Briony's older sister, a young, moody, bored heiress. We're shown that she runs hot and cold towards Robbie. He's well mannered, respectful, ambitious & generally a 'nice' young man. This 'nice' boy writes a vulgar letter to Cecilia, with whom he is infatuated. He accidentally gives it to Briony to deliver, thinking he's sending an apology note. Briony reads it, then gives it to her sister. It serves as a catalyst for the initiation of R & C's 'relationship', & they have sex in the library (thank GOD for DVD. I'd recommend fast-forwarding thru the sex scene like I did; it's unnecessary, as all such scenes, stupid...I also got the impression it was long). Briony walks in & sees them. This,(together with the letter & Briony's previous witness of a suggestive encounter) is crucial is twisting Briony's imagination for the worst. She then falsely testifies that Robbie raped her cousin.<br/><br/>That's the set up for the movie. The majority of it is told through a series of flashbacks and time repeats. We're never shown WHY R & C should be together, WHY they're in love, yet the movie forces you to sympathize with their plight. Robbie spends some time in jail, but when offered the choice of going to war, he does. Cecilia shuns her family & goes on her own to wait for him, because she's suddenly so in love. Briony decides to punish herself by forgoing university education & choosing to train as a nurse. Director Joe Wright doesn't bother to show the heart of any of these events, their beginning or the gradual effects on the characters. You'd think he would, considering that they're the major consequences of Briony's actions & crucial to the story. He just plops you down in the middle of it, and you're expected to feel R & C's pain, the Tallis family's pain at Cecilia's estrangement, & Briony's repentance.<br/><br/>The movie does give some feeling of regret and hopelessness, but it's mostly superficial & not for R & C. It's for Robbie as an individual stuck in the horror of war when he doesn't want to be, and for Briony as someone trying to atone & find peace with herself. Some of the war scenes could've been replaced with scenes that give the movie a more solid foundation. It just feels too heavy-handed and halfway, as if the makers intended it to be great, but got lost in production details & forgot small things called the script & plot. Great job with the production, though; use of extras, sets, visuals and camera work are commendable. Knightley's wardrobe seems a little risqué for the 1940's, & I suppose it was to emphasize the physical attraction between her & Robbie, on which their relationship seems to be based.<br/><br/>The performances were generally good, a little overrated. McAvoy's character doesn't have enough to leave a strong impression. He does well with what he has, as he's done with his other roles I've seen. He's natural & not distracting from the character. Knightley is same old, same old. Despite the script, she could've shown more depth. She needs to change her body language for roles & stop talking like there's gum in the back of her mouth. She's overrated by the critics imo, but at least she doesn't give the 'on cue, rehearsed' feeling that Rachel McAdams does. All three Brionys (Ronan, Romola Garai & Vanessa Redgrave in chrono. order) are well acted, although I thought the older two could've been more coordinated with the younger. Ronan is excellent, esp with the English accent (I believe she's Irish).<br/><br/>I won't state any other spoiler. I'm glad I didn't see it in theatre. It's nice, not great, & didn't make me want to talk about it, unless it's to say how it could've been better. It doesn't live up to the novel & I wonder if the author is pleased."

","This is one of my lower priority Oscar/Golden Globes-nominated movies,as I had no familiarity with the novel and the perception of this film came off as being a ""wispy,English period piece"". Those reasons and also that this was shown in somewhat limited distribution outside of NYC or LA up until closer to the Academy Awards. So with that in mind,I was resigned to seeing this film on DVD and probably long after the Awards had been given out.<br/><br/>HAving finally seen this,I can say that while my curiosity was satisfied and I found stuff to like about it,I wasn't as awed or overwhelmed as some whose comments I've skimmed here.<br/><br/>The damage done by 13-year-old Briony Tallis(Saorise Ronan,later to be played by Romola Garai)in regards to the relationship between her older sister Cecilia(Keira Knightley)and her prospective boyfriend,a longtime family friend and grounds keeper(James McAvoy)is deep enough to tear the two asunder,right as England is being thrust into World War II. Over the course of the movie,all three principals(and of course,to an extended degree,their friends and other family members)are affected in ways that are both profound and simple.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright paces this movie in a slow,somewhat detached way and,depending on your patience for artsy,disjointed narrative,will either fascinate or frustrate. There is absolutely no hurry to spell out the situations,or for that matter fill in any blanks that the story leaves. To me,it feels kinda like dirty pool being played here:sure,you're drawn in and intrigued,but it seems to string the viewer out and then leave said viewer perhaps confused and even angry by the third act.<br/><br/>Beautiful imagery and attention to detail makes this film at least marginally above average. Credit cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and film editor Paul Tothill with that.

"Wolfi-10","6","1","3","14 May 2008"," A sad story that one is relieved to recognize as not likely to be true.
","Being loved by two girls at once, as for example by two sisters, does not seem to be as much of a neat thing as this reviewer always imagined, never having had the experience himself. That is, it's not if one of the sisters has a mean streak and disposes with the common object of desire rather than seeing it being swept up by the sisterly rival. In this case, the means of disposal presented itself by a case of rape that, too, provided new insights into a heretofore murky area of human relations. It took place at night in the park of the manor when all members and guests of that multitudinous household were searching for two run-away boys. So there were a number of possible perpetrators; but it's curious that the victim had no clue which one it was, although she, like everyone else of the search party, was presumably equipped with a flashlight (or a ""torch"", as the British might say). It is even more puzzling that said perpetrator was able to carry out his deed with one hand over the girl's eyes (to prevent her from seeing him) and the other hand over her mouth (to prevent her from crying for help) - a properly dressed girl of the English upper classes. It is true, pantyhose hadn't been invented yet, and, this being the middle of summer, even those famous British knickers had been dispensed with (as we observed gleefully when the older sister took a dip in the fountain) - but still, the dresses were long and cumbersome. What comes across as not less puzzling is the English criminal justice system that gives more weight to a 12-year old girl of a known fancy disposition than to a series of character witnesses (which were hopefully heard) plus the fact that the accused was at the time of the crime in another area of the grounds actually finding the missing boys. If taking the story seriously, one begins to wonder in light of these puzzles, (i) whether the claim of rape was actually a cover-up of an inopportunely caught dalliance; and (ii) whether the British class system's preferred way of dealing with an unpleasant incidence is the quick conviction of a middle-class patsy, rather than an earnest investigation that might lead to the unfortunate discovery of one of their own. However, the film does not give strong enough hints that the story's author had such possibilities in mind. <br/><br/>However, while the film placed all the guilt and remorse on the young girl's shoulders and showed how she suffered under it for the rest of her life, it should certainly have shed some light on the thoughts and feelings of the rapist or surprised lover; whatever he was, he was the really guilty party. One might be led to think that he was completely oblivious to the harm he caused to others; but displaying this contrast clearly would have rendered the movie more complete, and possibly ameliorated those slightly unconvincing events at the beginning. <br/><br/>Speaking of unconvincing events: That the British were not further tackled by the Germans when they scrambled from the continent at Dunkirk is wondrous but historically true; that some (or at least one) of them got, in the middle of that cacophony, his feet washed by a French woman, must be classified as utter piffle. Or was that to be taken allegorically? Oh, stupid me."

","This movie wasn't awful, but it relied on too many ""tricks"" of flashback and closeup angles to try and disguise it as great cinema. The first part of the film was okay, but honestly didn't spend nearly enough time developing the characters of Keira Knightley or her lover, to make their love story plausible. Just lots of long looks and confusing sexual tension, and an absurd scene where Keira Knightley strips down to her knickers to dive into a fountain to retrieve part of a vase that got broken, right in front of the servant lover. In broad daylight no less. Even if the affair were true, any young woman of high status at that time would never imagine doing such a thing. Discretion would be a main priority. I just couldn't really care about these characters - Briony for her ineptitude and selfishness, and Keira Knightley and her lover (can't remember the actor's name) for their lack of chemistry. Honestly, they borrowed the sex scene right out of The English Patient, which I think was the feeling and greatness they were hoping to achieve, but they didn't get there. Better films of this genre include the above and also ""The End of the Affair"" with Julianne Moore and Ralph Fiennes. Also check out the old ""Brief Encounter"" by director David Lean."

","Joe Wright directs this beautiful story based on the Ian McEwan novel. Thirteen year old Briony Tallis(Saoirse Ronan)often stands at the window of her family's enormous mansion and lets her vivid imagination breed ideas. Its 1935, and this dubious young girl of privilege and wealth sees herself a fledgling writer. She thinks grandiose and drama. On a hot summer day, she thinks she sees something between her sister Cecila(Keira Knightley)and Robbie(James McAvoy), the son of the estate's grounds keeper. Her crush on Robbie and jealousy drives her to accuse him of a salacious crime he did not commit. To reduce jail time, the young man will choose the military during wartime. Briony for years will be haunted by the irrevocable harm she caused her beautiful sister and the man she begs to come back to her. She wants to confess her horrible lie; it won't come until she is ready to publish her 21st novel entitled ATONEMENT. The scenery is as lavish as it is at times harsh. Knightley is so ravishing, she can carry this two hour movie through its dismal moments. The finale finds the veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave playing Briony and this sequence will make your chest cave in and breathing almost stop. There may even be a tear or two as you try to swallow with a throat dry as attic dust. In time this movie will prove to be a classic. The cast also features: Romola Gari, Benedict Cumberbatch, Juno Temple, Julia West and Patrick Kennedy."
"robert-temple-1","10","1","3","3 March 2008"," One of the best British films in many years
","This film is an instant classic, as everyone fully realizes. However, people should not be making such a fuss about James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, just because they played the romantic leads in the film, which of course they did very well indeed. There are easily a hundred actors and actresses who could have done just as well in these two undemanding parts (what is easier than to gaze longingly at someone? I do it every day at my wife, and no one has given me an Oscar yet, perhaps because I am not actually acting), and the idea that Keira Knightley should have won a Bafta or an Oscar rather than Marion Cotillard is absurd (and thank goodness she didn't, and that sheer genius was rewarded). But that said, this film contains some truly spectacular performances which made the film a success. The first is that of the thirteen year-old Saoirse Ronan, who in the story commits the terrible act for which no atonement is possible. She well deserved her Oscar, Bafta, and Golden Globe nominations. Without her, the film could have been tepid, as its core would have been weak. The other amazing performance is by that genius for all seasons, Vanessa Redgrave, whose appearance at the end makes the whole film click into perfection. There are excellent supporting efforts from Harriet Walter (fancy her dressed as Radclyffe Hall, whatever next, I ask you?), Juno Temple, fresh from her success in 'Notes on a Scandal' (maybe she wants to become a screen goddess now, having become bored with being only a Roman one), and frankly, all the others. Having achieved such a triumph, it seems pointless to repeat all the well-deserved praise which has been lavished on this powerful film which has burnt its way into the hearts of thousands with its searing story of remorse. Ian McEwan's story, Joe Wright's direction, and Christopher Hampton's wonderful script, have combined with the whole cast and crew to make a masterpiece. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus (as well as a Sanity Clause), and yes, there is still a British film industry."

Well made? Absolutely. A masterpiece? Certainly not.<br/><br/>I think the symbols in the movie were the most interesting thing about it. Water and drowning represent the dialectic between passion, life and death. I also liked the fact that it turned out the whole movie was a novel; so almost everything about it was fiction! <br/><br/>So, 'where's the problem', you'd ask. Simply put: It was too 'american-hollywood' stuff. Something that's meant to win an Oscar -in the end, it didn't, but I'm sure the intention of the producers was the golden statue. In my opinion, the way the director presented the old writer in the end, was the worst possible. She simply tells us everything! No ambivalence, no art, no symbols! What a waste, my God! <br/><br/>Anyway, to summarize: It could have been a lot better. The way it is, it's just good. Nothing more, nothing less."

The cinematography was amazing, as well as the music.<br/><br/>Now on to why I only gave it a 7.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","3","16 February 2008"," No Atonement
","The first half of ""Atonement"" is so deadly slow and dreary, in spite of the spectacular cinematography of Seamus McGarvey. However, the ending captivated and blew me away. Vanessa Redgrave surprises as an old Briony, now near the end of her days, talking about her latest and final novelan autobiographical story. She confesses, ""I don't expect to be forgiven."" The touching irony of Director Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" is that it is not. Briony may have spent her entire adult life in penance for what she did when she was 13 years old, but ultimately she may not be forgiven. Director Wright and Screenwriter Tim Bevan (who adapted Ian McEwan's novel) tell a story of star-crossed love and profound sadness. I really liked ""Atonement"" more than I thought I would. I truly admired the craft of the movie more than the touching tragedy. Personal preference aside, ""Atonement"" is a great movie.<br/><br/>It is 1935 England before World War II. We observe the world of upper middle class England. Precocious 13 year old Briony Tallis (Saoire Ronan) fancies herself a play writer. Her beautiful older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) battles her raging hormones. She has a physical attraction for Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the Tallis' maid. Robbie is the estate handyman. Briony too, has an unrequited crush on handsome Robbie. The Tallis' have house guests in the Quincey children, Lola (Juno Temple) and her brothers Jackson and Pierrot. Briony and Cecilia's older brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) returns home from school with his bud Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch)a creepy young chap.<br/><br/>Briony spies Cecilia with Robbie in a compromising situation by the estate fountain. Robbie gives Briony an accidentally enclosed letter for Cecilia, which she secretly reads before giving to her sister. Robbie (McAvoy) and Cecilia (Knightley) engage in a totally steamy and erotic tryst in the family library, which Briony witnesses. Then during a family crisis, Briony (Ronan) perpetrates a lie that sends Robbie to prison, and Cecilia is irrevocably separated from her true love. Though only 13 years old, Briony does not realize that her lies may have destroyed true love and more importantly the lives of people she loves.<br/><br/>Now 5 years later, Robbie is in France in the middle of World War II. Cecilia has left home and has become a nurse. 18 year old Briony (Romola Garai) has decided to leave Cambridge to become a nurse like her sister. This is her attempt to reconcile with Cecilia. What echoes throughout ""Atonement"" is Knightley's plea to McAvoy's Robbie, ""Come back Come back to me."" ""Atonement"" is punctuated by profound yearning of the heart, and resounding sadness. Keira Knightley is sexy, amazingly strong, and movingly vulnerable. James McAvoy is compelling and compassionate throughout. He embodies nobility in Robbie's suffering soul. The surprise is Romola Garai as the older Briony. She is amazing as Briony begins to realize the pain and suffering she caused by her lie years ago. Vanessa Redgrave is powerful and sad as the old Briony, spent by a life in penance.<br/><br/>Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" is touchingly sad. Life ends, and at best that life ends complete. However, we can not always expect to be forgiven for our misdeeds and unintended cruelties. So perhaps, the best we can do is be at peace with life being incomplete. There is no atonement in ""Atonement"", and that may have been the point of Wright's passionately moving story."
"tomgould749","6","1","3","12 February 2008"," Atonement
","Atonement initially fails to deliver on any major level. Most of the time the plot remains fairly slow moving and somewhat routine. Hoewever it works due to the fact that it is very powerfully acted by the lead roles namely Romola Garai, Keira Knightley, Saorise Roman and James McAvoy. You can tell that this story was initially a novel and in the opening sequence it is difficult to determine whether this is meant to be a musical or a period drama, which it turns out to be. On saying that, unlike many clichéd period dramas this one actually delivers something of subsidence in the form of the clever twist at the end. The great tragedy of this story is that it shows what can happen when a child comes into contact with a situation that they don't understand and due to the time in which they are, no one is prepared to give them any actual guidance as to how to behave or to respond to that type of situation. We can be thankful I suppose that we live in the age that we do where people are a bit more clued up about male and female relationships then they were 60 or 70 years ago ."
"jemmytee","5","1","3","2 February 2008"," Oh, what a wicked web we weave....yada, yada, yada.
","This will be a short review because I refuse to add to the tedium of this movie. And as someone who dislikes pushing a story to unfold too quickly, for me to call this thing tedious is a big deal.<br/><br/>The story, such as it is, revolves around young Briony Tallis, who sees a few incidents that could be and are misconstrued. After each incident, the story jumps back and shows us that what she saw has an innocent explanation, but she still uses them to send the gardener, Robbie Turner, to prison for a crime he did not commit. Then comes World War 2 and Dunkirk and the story shifts to the long distance longing of Robbie and Briony's sister, Cecilia, and how Briony begins trying to atone for her lies.<br/><br/>Of course, the production values are good. The acting is good. Kiera Knightly and James McAvoy make a surprisingly acceptable couple. Sometimes the director gets a little carried away with things, but not ridiculously so. I got no complaints there. And let me make clear -- I have not read the book ""Atonement"" is based on, so my only reference concerning this story is the movie. But if the book is anything like this overly-self-important ""film"", I'll never go near it. I hate being lied to by a storyteller -- and that is what this movie does about halfway...no, maybe two-thirds of the way through. I won't say what that lie is, but it all works around that age-old saying, ""Oh, what a wicked web we weave when first we practice to deceive."" The movie should have paid attention to its own message."
"PunchB","7","1","3","28 January 2008"," Notable structural problems
","Very mild spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>This was sadly another movie that was lesser than the sum of its parts. I really loved the cinematography. I actually really liked all the scenes too. But the story as a whole didn't work, because of the ending.<br/><br/>It's the ""but it was all a dream"" ending again. Just one scene was a ""dream"" (i.e. fiction) of course, but a very important scene. I can't figure out why screenwriters think it works to trick the audience into thinking that one thing happens, and then yank the mat out from under them and say, ""But that's not really what happened after all!"" It's like the old Briony said, it wouldn't be a very good story if it had been told straight like it happened (i.e. showing what really happened to the two lovers and then ended it). The same applies to this movie, which means that the story, the ""real"" story, in itself is not a strong one. But it certainly didn't turn into a better story by adding a scene as a deceit and having the old Briony explain what it all meant in the end. This movie really showed me how incredibly difficult it is to write a good *story*.<br/><br/>Just to clarify, I don't mind dream sequences (or even fictitious scenes as told by a character) in movies if it fits with the tone, and the audience either knows it's a dream or isn't entirely sure. But don't use it in a movie where every other scene has shown reality and the tone doesn't begin to suggest that this scene wouldn't also be real. In Atonement it's clearly meant to deceive the audience into thinking it was real. In what world is that a clever or poetic trick to use? Well I guess it's ""clever,"" in a calculating way.<br/><br/>Better to show a fictitious scene from Briony's book (and say that that's what it is) *after* we have seen what really happened. But that would be a totally different movie and the scene would have to be totally different. And I don't think it would have helped the story of what really happened; it still wouldn't have worked to show it straight before we get to the fiction.<br/><br/>I get that Atonement is about writing; maybe that's the problem. It's about writing all right, but at the expense of everything else: since the characters aren't real anymore (in certain key scenes), they're actually *characters*; their misery or sadness ultimately doesn't matter. It's all a conceit. There is a right way of doing it though; The comic book The Sandman was about storytelling without sacrificing the characters or any of the other themes.<br/><br/>Atonement still gets a 7, because many things about it were incredibly well done. I think it could've been a 10 if the story had worked."

","I enjoyed the first act immensely. It all takes place in one day and is cinema in its finest form. Simple acts take on mythical qualities. The use of time and music gave energy to what would have otherwise felt to be a slow pace. I was especially a fan of the subtle, dark humor including the use of a naughty word I wouldn't have even thought to be in existence in the 1930s and a man telling a young girl to ""bite it. You have to bite it"" (referring to the chocolate he's given her). Very funny moments, and in fact, both become pivotal to the story. The rest of the film is also pretty good, just not as much so as the first portion. I felt it became a bit too WWII clichéd at times. The casting of all the 'Briony' actresses was remarkable for likeness and talent, and all the performances and film-making were still spot on, but I found myself wanting more of the story. What happened during his prison time? I guess what was really missing for me was significant enough development of the romantic relationship. I didn't really believe they could truly be in love. I should also say I don't care too much for scenes in films that turn out to have not really happened. Still, the second half of the film had some powerful moments, and overall ATONEMENT is an excellent motion picture."
"georgioskarpouzas","8","1","3","26 January 2008"," ambivalent realities
","I admit that I found this movie far too complex and full of upheavals than I could cope with. The idea of presenting the central-flawed heroine- in three different periods of her life was impressive and I admit that I was surprised by the final turn of events although I had a read a hint about that in a paper that I had not completely understood. As for the actors I am a fan of Keira Khightley and I admired her performance- she has I think found an idealtypus portraying upper class British girls with romantic leanings.The actress who played Briony was convincing in her role- I am referring to her as a young girl.I can not but point out that the scenes in the beach with the soldiers were heart-rending and were of Hogarthian power. I have such an ambivalent impression from this movie witch I think captures the real intricacies of actual life in times of political and social upheavals- a description that actually includes every age. The evocation of the English country side was fine and Keira Knightley swimming and diving was like Aprodite coming out of the waves although she was a more Anglo-Saxon Aphrodite that the known Mediterreanean one. I would recommend this movie also on the grounds that contrary to Hollywood cliché it does not presents the plot as a thriumph of good over evil. The real rapist marries the victim and becomes very successful largely because of the war, Robbie dies because of the war-as a soldier-which he became because he was falsely accused and Cecilia dies during the war- as many British people did due to an aerial bombardment.Briony is going to die because of illness but in an age that her death can not be consider as punishment for her sins. So reality is not valued in moral terms and the plot has evolution that defies conventional notions of just retribution and crime and punishment. The depiction of life in an English country house is also convincing and one might think that it could have been like that during the relevant age. I very much recommend this film which I found of great sophistication, British flair and moral ambivalence."

","Okay now I went to see this film because people were comparing it to Titanic, a film in which I liked very much. I also went to see it b/c I heard it will most likely be up for an Oscar. The film for me, however, was an overall let down. Sure the film was artistic and had symbolism in it but the story told did not engross me on the screen. There is no real build up of the love or connection between Cecilia and Robbie. Also there is no build up of the longing that Robbie and Cecilia feel for each other as I'm sure there is in the book. So basically there is no real love story although there is supposed to be. This left me with a rather flat view of the circumstances that were to be driving this film. In Titanic, you get the feeling that Rose and Jack have loved each other all of their lives when in fact they have not know each other for more than a week. In Atonement you only get the feeling that they have just met and that Robbie would like to get back to Cecilia; when what you should be getting is the sense that these two lovers are meant for each other and there is nothing that either of them won't do in order to be in each others arms again. I guess what this film is lacking is more obstacles and a lot more character and story development. No way should this film be up for an Oscar. Sure it's artistic but aren't films made to be entertaining, engrossing, and artistic? If so, there are more choices that I would put up for an Oscar before Atonement."

He meets the twins and Lola, and it's obvious that Lola thinks he's cute.<br/><br/>Robbie meanwhile has written a letter to Cee, discarding the first draft which is very sexually explicit, and replacing it. He asks Briony to deliver it. Briony reads it; she has the wrong letter, in fact. She thinks Robbie is a sex maniac. When Robbie appears for dinner, Cee and Robbie have a confrontation which leads to them having sex up against a bookcase. Briony walks in on them.<br/><br/>While everyone is at dinner, the twin boys disappear, and everyone goes out to look for them. Just as Briony comes upon Lola, a man runs away from her prone body. Lola has been molested. Briony accuses Robbie.<br/><br/>Thus begins the ruination of lives in this beautifully directed and photographed film. Robbie goes to prison. His mother (Brenda Blethyn) is devastated. In 1939 he is given a chance to either stay in prison or enter the army, which he does. Cee's father was going to finance his going to medical school; he is now cut off. Cee knows Robbie is innocent and walks out on her family and becomes a nurse during the war. Briony (now Romola Garai) does the same.<br/><br/>The question becomes, how much did Briony understand when she lied -- did she really believe her sister was being attacked by Robbie and that he was a sex maniac? Or was she jealous of her sister and Robbie and acted out of anger? The audience needs to decide.<br/><br/>This film is filled with sadness and longing, with an idyllic beginning that ends in horror, and at the end, a final twist. As Briony must live with her burden and desire to atone, we are stuck with the results of her act and the havoc and heartbreak it causes.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is the perfect '30s young beauty here. In the beginning, she is a gorgeous woman from a wealthy family with probably no end of gentlemen callers - it's all ahead of her. Later she not only has to deal with the effects of the war but of the man she loves going to prison.<br/><br/>James McAvoy does a wonderful job with a much showier role -- again, in the beginning, one is aware of his glowing youth and of him being in love; then he is dragged off to prison and ends up in the trenches.<br/><br/>I must mention Benedict Cumberbatch in a small but pivotal role here, as I watched this film because of him. He's extremely dashing as Paul, and very charming. The film was made three years before he hit it big with Sherlock.<br/><br/>The audience has to decide if there was any atonement as well as process the last half hour or so of this film, which comes as a surprise.<br/><br/>An enchanting film showing the destructive power of a lie."

","There are movies that come along every once in a while that leave you speechless; Atonement is exactly this kind of movie. After finishing the movie I was left emotionally drained and almost in shock of the sheer greatness I had just witnessed. The combination of emotion, fear, beauty, and all around excellent acting puts Atonement at the top of my list of favorite movies. Keira Knightly stars as Cecilia, a stuck up English woman who is desperately trying to find her place in the world. In comparison to some of her other famous performances in Pride and Prejudice or Pirates of the Caribbean, she shows a similar side in Atonement yet she still gives an unforgettable performance. She is aggressive yet poised, and seems to know exactly what she wants despite the disapproval of others around her. Cecilia truly stands out with her strong facial structure and lack of emotion not often seen from women in romance movies. Atonement follows her and Robbie's gut wrenching romance from start to finish and literally leaves you hanging on to their every interaction. The gardener, Robbie, brings out a side in Cecilia that you may have never seen from Keira Knightly as an actress. His simplicity and boyish charm is a surprising match for Cecilia yet they are just so wonderfully meant for each other. Throughout the movie you can just feel the sexual tension brewing between the two, leaving you wondering what will happen next. James Mcavoy (Robbie) almost outshines Keira in his acting due to the raw emotion he brings to the table. The story line speaks for itself but the acting skills of Mcavoy truly do stand out. Another stand out actress is Saoirse Ronan who plays Cecilia's younger sister, Briony. Throughout the film it is easy to see Briony's longing to live up to her sister and outshine her in any way possible. Their conflicting personalities lead to Briony's decision to alter Robbie and Cecilia's lives forever. Due to misconception and immaturity, Briony commits an act that can never be forgiven. Although a young and fairly new actress, Ronan delivers an outstanding performance. Her haunting eyes leave you wondering what kind of evil lies within children and how far they will go to get what they want. The combination of Knightly and Ronan truly is a perfect match. Both girls are very head strong and it is easy to see that they have probably never understood each other. Jealousy remains between them that leads to an exciting twist in the middle of the plot. Not only are the actors and story line absolutely outstanding, the sets and costumes really tie everything together. The movie is primarily set in an English manor in 1935 which gives the image of an old fashioned well-to-do family while the movie also displays images of World War II. The combination of environments keeps the excitement rolling and also keeps the audience on their toes. Not only does the time frame change drastically, so do the characters and the journeys they embark on. Costume choice also plays a big role in the movie as Cecilia is portrayed a sultry woman and Briony as a young child. This juxtaposition also adds to their differences as characters. Robbie is obviously from a much lower class family than Cecilia which is also portrayed through costume design. This is another factor that adds to the many differences within the couple. Overall, I absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it. The dramatic twists and turns constantly keep you wondering what will happen next. Gut wrenching emotion as well as unforgivable deceit make this movie one of a kind. Atonement is an all around excellent movie that you simply cannot forget."
"MLDinTN","5","1","4","15 October 2008"," I didn't think it deserved any award nominations
","I'm not sure why this movie got such high critical acclaim. I didn't think it was that good. First, it's one of those movies that skips around the timeline, which I don't particularly like. It starts to become confusing. Just show the film in time order. Also, the actors talk so fast, I could only understand what they said by turning on the closed caption. Basically, the movie centers on a lie told by a young girl, Briony. Briony sees her older sister and the house keeper's son near a fountain and gets the wrong impression. Then there is a mix up in letters and Briony reads the one she shouldn't. Next she catches her sister and Robbie in an intimate moment in the library. I think she is sort of jealous because she likes Robbie too and also thinks he is a perv. The twins run away and everyone goes outside and looks for them. Briony comes across her underage cousin with a guy in the woods. Her cousin claims she doesn't know who the man was. Briony didn't really get a good look, but assumes it must be Robbie and swears to it. She lies be saying she saw his face when she really didn't. This causes her sister and Robbie to live in misery. Robbie goes to jail and her sister can't forgive her. At the end we learn what happened to Cee and Robbie, and Briony does the only thing she knows to do to atone for her mistake.<br/><br/>The surprise ending was nothing earth shattering. The movie was just too long and it just didn't capture my attention.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Just OK. I sure don't think it was worthy of Oscar nominations."
"Bunuel1976","7","1","4","14 February 2008"," ATONEMENT (Joe Wright, 2007) ***
","This year I've fallen so far behind in checking out the films up for an Academy Award that this one is actually the first of the heavyweight contenders  and the ceremony is just two weeks away! Anyway, this is a very British product: exceedingly refined and, therefore, teetering on the edge of boredom  in short, overrated, and encapsulating what passes for an Oscar-worthy title these days. Given the film's old-fashioned appeal and being unfamiliar with the work of director Wright, I was surprised by its flashy technique (perhaps adopted to disguise the thin plot which, such as it is, doesn't really compel attention) with the entire war segment and, in particular, the apparent necessity to present it in such detail i.e. not merely graphic but even reverting to unsubtitled French for a couple of scenes, coming off as a distraction more than anything else! The lengthy tracking shot on the beach seen during this segment is a valiant attempt even if, again, it doesn't present us with anything we haven't seen before in countless war-themed movies.<br/><br/>Rather, it's the central idea of a single impulsive action (by a child) having terrible repercussions on an amorous young couple  and, by extension, her own life  which is the most interesting and sensitively handled (particularly when, during the moving finale, it's established that part of what has gone on before is purely wish-fulfillment on the girl's part!). Incidentally, she's the real protagonist of the narrative  despite the couple (James McAvoy and Keira Knightley) being top-billed; the girl is actually played by three different actresses (including Vanessa Redgrave)  since we see her through various phases of her life  and all of them deliver fine performances (the youngest, in fact, Saiorse Ronan has even been Oscar-nominated). In essence, this is a reasonably good film within the (low) standards prevalent nowadays  but, as with most of modern cinema, it doesn't really warrant more than a cursory viewing for me."
"DICK STEEL","7","1","4","25 January 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Atonement
","So now we know why the young must be protected from vulgarities and from sexual scenes, because with vivid imagination, they could probably be quick to jump to conclusions, being unable to grasp and fully understand the situation at hand, nor the gravity of their actions, especially when they're shooting from the hip.<br/><br/>Initially, I thought I would be able to watch Atonement if I had managed to make my way to Tokyo for its International Film Festival last October. But I didn't, and I waited, and waited, and when I finally managed to watch it this evening, I felt that it didn't work for me, no matter how much I can identify with the longing to be with someone, and being unable to. It contained themes I very much like, but perhaps I'm beginning to get tired of it, since they are somewhat negative emotions that do take their toil over a period of time.<br/><br/>Set in the 30s England just before the outbreak of WWII, we get introduced to the rather aristocratic Tallis family, where we witness the budding start of a romance between Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and the housekeeper's son ROBBY (James McAvoy), with the help of flimsy, wet lingerie to bridge the divide separating their swearing of true feelings for each other. However, to sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan, who clinched an Oscar Nomination), she starts to see a different side of it, made worse by a misunderstanding and in actuality, a mistake Robby made when he handed over a letter written with tongue in cheek and brain in the gutter (yep, you can say men think about sex most of the time).<br/><br/>And that one single day had everything a loving couple could have wished for - the discovery and declaration of love, the passionate love making, but only for everything to come crashing to a halt when Robby gets accused for a crime he did not commit. And you can feel the disappointment and anger of course, at the accusation because it was somewhat steeped in presumptions of class or the lack thereof, and the hypocrisy, coupled with seething rage as we the audience, with knowledge of hindsight (and the benefit of just knowing), can tell that it's so utterly wrong, with obvious clues of course to who the perpetrator might be.<br/><br/>While we love to see the lovebirds coming together, the movie's more about the time they spend apart. And that unfortunately somehow sagged the movie to low depths, as we see them spend their screen time independently, with McAvoy brooding over his life now in disarray as he volunteers for war to escape from the confines of a prison cell, and Knightley unfortunately becoming relegated to a support role, which you can hardly feel her character, her pain, and her love for the man now so far away. It is hardly any wonder why both actors missed out on Oscar nominations (not that it mattered), because their roles hardly challenged what these 2 actors could have delivered. The scene stealer turned out to be child actress Saoirse Ronan, who is the cause of the turn of events, though the mantle of her character get passed to Ramola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.<br/><br/>What made Atonement work though was the technical side of it. The score was excellent and director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice) made sure it gelled so well with the visuals, that it becomes an extension to what's on screen. You can't deny that art direction and cinematography were superb. Editing was non-conventional, but never confusing, offering you both what is perceived truth, and hindsight knowledge, just as how Briony would have experienced it. But what's missing, for a romance at least, and the danger of having every technical aspect delivered so clinically, was the absence of an emotional resonance, because without it, a romance movie can be pretty empty, and soulless, going through the motions without attempting to allow you to crawl under their skins to empathize with them and their sorry plight.<br/><br/>I had looked forward to Atonement with so much anticipation, that I guess when I've finally seen it, my expectation got deflated so bad that it turned out to be anti-climatic for me, even with an ending that should have wowed and kept one thinking and discussing about the unfortunate futility of one's actions, set in stone, setting the wheel in motion, and being unable ever to be turning it back."

","my wife and i went to get her a pair of eyeglasses in west knoxville this weekend we were told the glasses would be ready in 3 hours so we had to go kill some time. we went to downtown west several movies showing but we close to see atonement,usually i do not care for British movies or what the golden globe say when it comes to the best picture of the year as i find the foreign press very critical of the USA in most cases, so i really did not think this movie would be worth seeing but thought what the heck!!!<br/><br/>the movie atonement i must say is one of the best i have seen in many of years but be warned it is a haunting movie as when you leave the theater you are still thinking about it. i suppose we all have secrets in our family that we or someone take to their grave but atonement is all that and more.i love the mail 2 characters you all know who played the young lady has beauty but it is a very natural beauty and the lead guy could very well be your best friend so they are very likable and the way atonement plays out it is just 1 little thing that is seen from a young girls perspective that changes the lives or should i Saw ruins the lives of her own sister and the boy she loved , atonement is very emotional the scenes are as beautifully filmed yet very haunting almost cold at times. it leaves you thinking and wondering what if? don't we all have what if's in our own life? atonement covers plenty and you see what you want not always happy but always what you perceive to be the truth , then at the very end the truth is revealed,the sad truth , no it is not a English fairy tale a very emotional ride,i am going back to see the movie again so i can figure out a couple of other things, even if you were like me and don't like most British films see atonement it is the best i have seen in years!!this should win the Oscar but who knows ?"

","Every once in a while or perhaps every year there comes your usual epic love story. What I loved about this one is that it doesn't play like an epic. Here is a story that is about making amends and a love that was so strong it became an individual's redemption. The film opens in London circa 1935: 13-year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan, who can break your heart with those eyes) is a blossoming writer who one day misinterprets a series of events that occur between the affair of her older and determined sister, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightely) and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy, a pure hearted leading man). But one night, Briony accuses Robbie of a horrible crime he did not commit and is condemned for. Five years later, the love between Cecilia and Robbie is as strong as ever and they correspond while he fights the second world war. Meanwhile, Briony grows older (Romola Garai, an true star in the making) and realizes the mistake she made, but can she make things right again? The film lapses between the points of view of the sisters and Robbie as they go through their own struggles between the war and the home front. This film is definitely worth seeing and on my top ten favorites of 2007."
"vernoncoffee","5","1","4","11 December 2007"," If you're looking for yet another WW2 romantic tale with gorgeous leads
","If you're looking for yet another WW2 sad/romantic tale with two gorgeous leads, a precocious point of view, and dependable turns and twists, then this movie will be your cup of chi. I think a second look will reveal a number of significant problems.<br/><br/>First, there are trronged party or thoubling improbabilities at the key plot point of the movie. Two young children have gone missing in the English countryside at night. What does the household do; send everyone out in groups or at least in twos to search? No, they go out alone, including the boys' sister who is a stranger in the area. That my friends is a setup straight out of the B horror flick manual.<br/><br/>Second, after a supposed dastardly act has been committed against the sister, when Robbie Turner, the male lead and fall guy, returns later that night with the missing children, he doesn't act reasonably. Returning with the goods, one would expect him to call out something like, ""hey everyone, I found them. They were in the south meadow, in a haystack; cold and tired, but no worse for wear,"" or something along those lines in typical British casual humility. Instead, he is suspiciously mute and cautious for no reason at all.<br/><br/>Third, it seems no one including the police found it unlikely that an upstanding young man and semi-member of the family chose the night of a hunt for lost children to rape a visitor and then, as an after rape distraction, go out and actually find the missing children when no one else could.<br/><br/>If we can suspend disbelief about these several points, then it works fairly well as a WW2 sad romance, until the end that is, where it attempts a deeper moral aspect. The story jumps to the present, where we discover what we thought was the action, was actually a visualization of the plot of a new book by another member of the household, Briony Tallis, a now elderly author who is flogging her latest and possibly last book, on tour. The book is semi-biographical, in that events which happened to her and her family are the backbone of the plot. The author has waited till the end of her life to admit a great wrong she committed as a girl to several people and had never taken responsibility for. Now that she has completed a successful literary career and is safe behind age and a disabling disease, she will write about her fell deed. Well almost; actually the book has a happy ending or as the author puts it, a more hopeful ending. The truth will be revealed only in a cable channel book tour interview.<br/><br/>The question I pose is, did she alter the truth to make the book more hopeful or to be more sellable? That is, if she were genuinely interested in using her terrible experience to warn people about being overly romantic and leaping to serious conclusions based on impressions, then why wouldn't she have written the book telling the truly tragic result of her actions. Instead she manufactures a Happy Ever After Ending, just as she manufactured a HEAE so many decades before by purposely jumping into a weed filled pond when she couldn't swim so she could be ""saved."" <br/><br/>Which leads me to a second point, is it because Briony never outgrew the fanciful view of life and herself in it, that she confuses confession for atonement. Atonement is making amends or reparation, or paying for someone elses wrong doing. What she did was make a confession, an admission of guilt, and she did that half-*ssed."
"madonnawb","9","1","4","3 December 2007"," excellent story- great acting- superb ending!
","I went to the screening of Atonement with a friend happy enough to see a free movie and not expecting much- Actually I am also not a big Keira Knightley fan neither so clearly I was just happy to be out of the snow and watch whatever was being shown.<br/><br/>Atonement is set through 30s and 40s (mainly WWII) and revolves around the romance of the young Cecilia Tallis and the family up keeper Robbie Turner. Through a series of candid, naive and finally unfortunate events Robbie is accused of a heinous crime at the hands of the little Briory- Cecilia's little sister. The way this storyline and the plot are revealed and expressed was very original and effective in understanding what Briory sees and what actually happens. It is a perfect example how things aren't always what they seem, and makes one debate how much kids understand things and how reliable or guilty should they be of certain crimes.<br/><br/>At any rate, needless to say, Robbie and Cecilia are separated, Robbie is set to prison then war, families are torn apart and as Briory grows older she begins to realize not only the consequences of her actions, but also why she did what she did which is just as important. I do not want to reveal how the movie concludes and what happens to Cecilia, Robbie and Briory because the ending of the movie was for me the best part of this film- despite how tragic or unfavorable it may be, it was very original and moving.<br/><br/>The actress playing little Briory was very good compared to the one portraying the older one, and I was even more mesmerized by Keira Knightley whose performance is (do I dare to say it) truly Oscar worthy. She should stay away from Pirates of the Caribbean and silly movies like that and show her true talent in movies of a higher caliber. I was also very impressed with the visuals, the backtracking of the scenes and the storyline and the acting.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this movie!"

The acting from James Macavoy is pretty average, which matches the performances of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Overall this is a powerful film, but it's powerful punch is only made possible by the cheap trick played in the last 20 minutes of the film.

","After watching this wonderful film, I was left with only two questions, why the limited release and when will it be out on DVD. This is a heart touching film with spectacular shots based on a very well written book. Its a film that after watching you want to go out and tell all your friends and family to see. Unfortunately most of them around me will have to drive several hours to see it. The film seems to follow the story line of the book closely, or at least close enough that the fog of several years makes up for it. Although some of the imagery from the book is missing (Aka you still have to read the book for that literature class), it would be impossible to include the depth of the book. The film is very well put together and running sounds and images help it stay whole. <br/><br/>Over all a very good movie and one that is worth a second watch at the theater and well worth the drive! On some level I think the film wouldn't be worth watching in a normal theater, the audience in the theater where i watched it seemed both in aw and reverence to the film, you could hear a pin drop."
"Rathko","7","1","5","21 December 2007"," Suprsingly Unmoved
","The first half of the movie, set in the oppressive heat and isolation of an English country estate, is perfect. The over-elaborate wallpapers, the richly carved woodwork, the overgrown garden grottoes and the still ponds create an atmosphere of ripe foreboding.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie, however, set five years later is extremely disappointing after such a powerhouse opening. I, for one, was waiting for the big twist, the surprise, the payoff, that every reviewer had been talking about. It never came. The first half is tightly and elaborately plotted. The second has no plot at all: Robbie and Cecilia meet for tea; Robbie wanders around northern France; Cecilia does nothing at all; and Briony washes bedpans. There's no real sense of passion or longing between the separated lovers, and if we are to believe that Briony has volunteered for such menial work as a kind of self-inflicted punishment, she bares her lot so stoically that we never get a sense that she is suffering in any way, whether physically or emotionally. The constant announcements of ""three weeks later"", or ""six weeks earlier"", unnecessarily complicating the timeline of events, has the viewer questioning the veracity of the hidden meta-'storyteller' long before the supposedly surprising last act.<br/><br/>The fact is that none of the plot turns, those that the Washington Post describes as ""reverberate in a series of excruciating twists"", come as any real surprise. The viewer knows that the moment Robbie neatly folds up his dirty little note to Cecilia that he'll mistakenly pick up the wrong one, just as we know that when he passes it into the hands of Briony she'll not resist the temptation to read it. We know that Briony, given her state of mind, will accuse Robbie, just as we know the identity of the real culprit, who has been leering at every underage girl in the vicinity for the last half hour. While being able to predict every turn of events may build a certain degree of fateful dread, it does not constitute 'excruciating twists'.<br/><br/>Jacqueline Durran, who created the grittily authentic costumes for 'Vera Drake', does an equally stellar job here. With Sarah Greenwood (production design) and Seamus McGarvey (cinematography), the three of them effortlessly recreate the world these characters life in, able to bring something fresh and original to settings that have been recreated a thousand times in movies over the years. The entire production is of the highest quality and the performances are universally excellent. But for me at least, the narrative was predictable and the story lacking in real passion or tragedy."
"acs_joel","7","1","5","17 December 2007"," Note to Self: Don't . . .
","Note to self: Don't get cute with events in history.<br/><br/>Atonement is a very good film with superb individual performances and lovely cinematography. When writing about an event as well recorded in history as the Dunkirk evacuation, why try to stylize it with absurd surreality? The ferris wheel, circus horses and singing choir did nothing for the story. A grittier, more realistic depiction would have been more appropriate. When writing about and filming war, regardless of the romance, the end product's realism will always be held up against true war movies like Band of Brothers of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The story is conceptually great, but with a few holes. The viewer is expected to believe a sensitive, 13 year-old, aspiring writer can be such a wicked bad seed as to send an innocent man, whom she loves, to prison by maintaining a fabrication through a trial. A trial that glaringly doesn't exist in the story."

","I had seen many reviews for this film based on the popular novel of the same name, and heard about many award nominations and wins, and the critics gave it five stars, so I thought why not give it a go. Basically the wealthy and privileged Tallis family in 1935 live in a large mansion in the countryside, the main focus family members are the sisters, thirteen year old Briony (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Saoirse Ronan) and the older Cecilia (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Keira Knightley). Briony is an aspiring writer, and she sees an incident down below at the fountain involving Cecilia and Robbie Turner (The Last King of Scotland's BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated James McAvoy), son of a family servant who wants to attend medical school, but we see their side of the story as an innocent mishap. Briony has a crush on Robbie, for some reason he writes a letter with highly sexual intentions, including the ""C"" word in it, instead of a true feelings one, and Briony reads it first, making her think he is a sex maniac, this is fuelled more when she spots them having sex in the library. Of course we saw the other side of this incident as well, but fuelled by jealousy and high concern Briony witnessed her cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) being raped, but she purposely falsely says it was Robbie. Three or four years later he has spent in prison, but he is allowed to be released if he agrees to join the army for World War II which he does agree to do, and Cecilia meanwhile has become a nurse for war soldiers and victims. Eighteen year old Briony (Romola Garai) has also become a nurse in London supporting the war effort, by now she has realised the damage she has caused to her sister and Robbie, and wants to atone (make up or apologise) for her actions. She starts by finding the true rapist of Lola, it was Robbie's friend Paul Marshall (Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch) who is now engaged to the older Lola, and after their marriage she confronts this past truth. Cecilia and Robbie do reconnect before he is shipped to France, but it is not long enough and their love never truly flourished once again, as his fighting became imminent and her hospital duties got in the way too. The end of the films sees the Older Briony (Vanessa Redgrave) is talking to an Interviewer (Anthony Minghella) about her new book, Atonement, an autobiographical novel telling the truth about really happened in her past. Flashbacks reveal that Robbie did not die in action but from a fatal illness, and Cecilia died from drowning inside an underground room, but to ""atone"" (make up for or apologise) for her actions, she wrote an alternative ending for the lovers in her novel.

Knightley and McAvoy give fantastic performances as the lovers that never truly flourish to the extent you want, young Ronan gives a brilliant performance with her time on screen, the war scenes are reasonable, but of course the tragic love story is the most watchable part, a splendid period romantic drama.

","The direction feels cold. The performances are rigid and unnatural. Everything feels so rushed. I felt empty when the first part ended, which in all honesty, is also the worst part in the original novel, so it gets a pass.<br/><br/>The second leg of the film really picks up and shows a bit more of that directorial flare. For the better or worse, the film retains the backbone of the novel, which in my opinion is slow and bloated at parts. It is a nice story with a memorable twist, the latter of which is well delivered here and makes for considerable satisfaction as the film ended. All in all, the film feels more focused than the novel, and yet it also shuns a lot of the aspects in the novel that I consider as highlights, such as the excellent character building and the sometimes sweeping feel of the prose, none of which is translated to the film medium.<br/><br/>This is a film of inconsistent quality that did its basic job at adapting a very famous novel."

","Personally I think this is a way overrated and horrible movie that only showcase selfish people doing selfish things to one another. The 13 year old not only depicts a word that should never be uttered, but then gets away with it and has no consequences. The two main lovers I believe honestly are just in lust and totally inappropriate for their time. Back then I'm pretty sure people fight make out in front of library walls- although obviously people had sex back then it was a lot more discreet and not nearly as brazen. Also they say they love each other although they've weren't even together and just had sex for first time randomly? Sounds more like love to me- and the whole older guy raping a 16 year old- although sadly more realistic hen the sex scene is definitely creepy and unsettling. Definitely wouldn't call it ""Best Picture."""

","I was left with a bitter feeling at the end of this movie after hearing the elderly Briony Tallis (Vanessa Redgrave) explain to an interviewer how she manufactured the extended love story between her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and lover Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Granted, and while putting things into perspective, young Briony (Saoirse Ronan) at the age of thirteen was not only mistaken in her accusation about Robbie, but was also in a bit of revenge mode after being rebuffed by him after the fountain 'drowning' incident. Her twenty first and final novel was meant to put to rest her conflicted heart over the matter of destroying two lives, but her means of 'atonement' at that point had no conciliatory effect on the way I felt about her character. Would that the relationship between Cecilia and Robbie have turned out the way it did following the war and it's aftermath, but it was all a fiction concocted by the troubled author. In a way, it's a story that never happened, at least as far as the latter half of the picture goes, so it left this viewer feeling as if he had been strung along. I don't think we had closure on chocolate heir Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) either, as their relationship further damned the future of Cecilia and Robbie as well. They could have come forward to contradict Briony's story when she was thirteen without jeopardizing their reputations, although to be fair, Lola was a kid at the time too and was certainly scared about what happened between her and Paul. So ultimately, all thoughts of a tragic love story between the principals was shattered by the end of the picture, leaving me with only a degree of measured contempt for the author who couldn't (or wouldn't) take responsibility when it mattered."

","Stylish visuals, smart performances, neat direction, excellent classy Music score, 'Atonement' has it all but, what about the writing? According to the Academy and certain critics, this is class stuff â€“ yet looking at a very large quantity of the viewer's comments, it seems they were more readily able to see the lack of believable story elements and situations contained within. Not many likable characters to help you connect with these, at times, one dimensional folk - who live their lives more like a group of yr 2000 HBO yuppie types - than the 1930s personalities they're supposed to be portraying. <br/><br/>This good looking movie with its interesting title - tends yet again to prove that the current folk who make up our movie analyzers and judges of award worthy product, might be sadly lacking any practical understanding of decent writing. Don't look too hard at the details within this work or you may find yourself questioning the wisdom of the somewhat, over-the-top raves dished out to this, ""could have been"" but, ""sadly is not"" such a good story. There are some moments of high emotional impact during the latter half's war years and the performers play it all for real but, overall this ends up being for the easily pleased or lovers of big glossy productions, with more set dressing than real character or attention to fine details."

While I think the acting was superb, the sets and locations were stunning and visually appealing, the sound track was wonderful, the style of the movie was not to my liking. The movie is written in snippets, telling a story, then back filling it in. It continues to do this throughout the entire length of the movie, and I found it at times hard to follow and cumbersome. I don't believe the actual story line made itself known until about and 1 1/2 hours into the movie, and I was disappointed in how it wrapped itself up.

","I watched Atonement for probably the fourth time tonight and i had goosebumps pretty much all the way through the film. It is a beautifully shot film and the actors portray their characters in such a real and organic way. The scene where they are filming on the shore line in France with all the soldiers scattered across the beach, this scene is was a particular moment when i was just astounded by how well shot the film was. There are no scenes or moments that are wasted, i felt that every little detail of every scene and every word said was crucial in telling the story. At the end of the film we find out what became of Cecilia and Robbie and it is just heartbreaking but the impact of the film relies on the two characters fate and it really hits home just how one mistake, one lie can change everything. This film for me is just perfect, i love absolutely everything about it, especially the cinematography. The score also is really important in building tension and the use of the type writer sound effect was just genius. I highly recommend this film, it won't be everyones cup of tea like all films are subjective but for me personally i highly regard this film and it would have to be on my list of my favourite films of all time.

"petedake","10","0","1","10 July 2015"," Outstanding!
","Tonight I watched for the fourth time the film Atonement based on the book with same title written by Ian McEwan. I remember the first time I watched this film. It was winter of 2007 and I had gone to the cinema with my sister and our parents.<br/><br/>The film came to an end and I remember myself not wanting to leave the room. It was the first and only time I felt like that. Even though I was so young, I felt so enchanted and heartbroken that I didn't want to leave the room until I don't know what.<br/><br/>This film is about forgiveness. The main characters are three young people. Cecilia, Robbie and Briony. Cecilia and Briony are sisters with the first being some years older than the other. Robbie is a young man to whom both sisters feel attracted to. But when by mistake Robbie gives Briony a letter to forward it to her sister, in which he admitted in a vulgar way that he wanted her, Briony feels betrayed by both Cecilia and Robbie and takes the decision to destroy both of there lives by testifying false that she saw Robbie molesting on her cousin Lola.<br/><br/>Police arrested Robbie and gave him the choice: Prison or Army. He chose army.<br/><br/>As years past Cecilia grew up to become a nurse and Briony was being prepared to join University but in the last minute she decided to become a nurse too, thinking that this was the only way she could help and in someway erase part of what she had done some years ago.<br/><br/>The film follows the lives of the three people. Robbie facing the cruelty of war, Cecilia helping in any way she can the soldiers and Briony never having forgotten of the awful thing she had done. Just before the end we see Cecilia and Robbie in their home living a happy life after war with him still facing some difficulties, and Briony visiting them to apologize which apology was never accepted.<br/><br/>And at the very end we see an old woman giving an interview. She's Briony Tallis the well known writer who gives an interview regarding her latest novel ""Atonement"". As she explains the end of the book is imaginary because Cecilia and Robbie never met again after the arrest. They both died, some days apart and this book ,as she says, has a happy ending not because she wants to lie to people but because she wants to give the two lovers the ending they deserved but never had because of her.<br/><br/>This film is truly a masterpiece. I wouldn't have watched it four times if it wasn't. And for the first time I feel that the film is better than the novel. Keira Knightely and James McAvoy are OUTSTANDING. They give the passion and tension their characters deserve. I give this film 10 out of 10 stars. There is not a single thing I didn't like or I would change. This film makes me cry every single time not so much because of the two lovers who didn't have the chance to enjoy their youth and love but because Briony lived a life in guilt. She was responsible for destroying two peoples lives and not only that. She never had the chance to do the right thing. And after the end she dies with her memory faded from some disease. And now I'm thinking of it, maybe that's a gift given to her because she had felt truly sorry. The gift was that she would for once feel innocent and kind. Having forgotten of what she did. She dies.<br/><br/>read more reviews on HTTP://bedtime reviews.word press.com"

","Atonement is awesome. It is a romance movie but the film dwells on a lot of other subjects such as regret, forgiveness, and hatred. James McAvoy plays Robbie who is falsely implicated by 13 year old Briony played by Saoirse Ronan who gives an Oscar-worthy performance. The casting is wonderfully done and the editing seamlessly fuses three separate generations together. Ultimately, Briony realizes her fault and is unable to make amends as Robbie and Cecilia are unwilling to forgive her. The visuals are realistic and the attention to detail is palpable. There is a brilliant scene in which Briony comes to Robbie and Cecilia's home to apologize for her mistake and James McAvoy gives a verbal thrashing letting out all the anger built up over the years. It is a stunning performance and is incredibly acted by everyone involved in this scene. As the movie is just a little over two hours, the movie flies by without leaving the feeling that any scene is dragging on needlessly. Atonement is definitely one of the best movies of 2007 and deserves to be seen by a wide audience."

","First this would have got at least another a point in rating if the screenplay had not have been screwed up at the end! Fairly true to the novel except for the gross butchering of the story at the end which had a subtle way of illustrating Briony's atonement and the enormity of loss at her birthday celebration and the eventual presentation of 'The Trials of Arabella'.<br/><br/>This was so poignant in the novel and the eventual breakdown of her cousin, was lost and omitted in the movie. Equally I felt the interview, which served entirely for the purpose of exposition was cheap and lacking. Great performance by Vanessa Redgrave yes, but could this not have been written to include the poetic implications that Ian McEwan first transcribed, albeit though a slight rip off of Sonnet 18.<br/><br/>The cinematography, provided a majestic look at landscape - even during the war. The movement shots, much like Pride and Prejudice were impressive, especially in the scene at Dunkirk, which emphasized Robbie's disorientation. Nice film, just disappointed with the last 10 mins."
"Rickting","6","0","1","20 March 2015"," Deeply flawed but graceful adaptation of an admired novel
","In this war romance based on a critically acclaimed novel, a girl through a series of misunderstandings accuses her sister's lover of a crime he did not commit, and it subsequently changes all of their lives. Joe Wright directs, and Keira Knightly and James McAvoy star. Another successful movie from Working Title, Atonement is a unique and sometimes powerful drama with shortcomings which fail to justify the number of academy award nominations. It's a good film but it's over-hyped. The film's selling point is its visuals, which are exquisite. The dazzling cinematography never fails to impress, and the legendary single take Dunkirk sequence is a beach scene to rival Saving Private Ryan's Omaha Beach battle sequence. Joe Wright's steady hand keeps the film afloat and his direction emphasizes the tension and (sometimes) the emotional power that the interesting storyline conveys. The visuals cannot be faulted, although the film too often spills into style over substance territory. Still, through the direction and staging, many individual scenes are powerful.<br/><br/>The trouble is that due to the complex narrative, the film keeps hopping between different events without coherency, which blunts its impact. The film isn't as powerful as it should be, since the love story is rushed and underdeveloped and the war scenes are just soldiers walking around mainly. Acting wise, James McAvoy does a good job and delivers on charisma and emotion with great success, but Keira Knightly, incapable of changing her voice even for one line, rarely touches the viewer. If she does, it's in a more distant way. She's not as awful as some say, but she just doesn't let her emotion through enough. As for Saoirse Ronan, she's striking at times, but too one note and emotionless to connect to the audience properly. Why she was nominated for an Oscar while McAvoy wasn't is a mystery. Overall, Atonement's script is uneven and only sometimes delivers on the emotion. Beautiful as the cinematography is, there's too much emphasis on visuals and not enough on the romance, which makes the story hard to care about at times. Still, that ending is a devastating sucker punch.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Hossein_Shamaghdari","3","0","1","4 November 2014"," An Indian American Film
","Indian Films are famous for their happening base stories. Atonement is based on a lot of happenings and occurrences. So I think this film is same Indian films but with a powerful structure same American films. If you review the story you will find a lot of events which are accidental. This problem is really unprofessional for a film at this level of production. All problems refer to screenplay of this film and my comment is this that film production is really powerful. If a film be based on accident, film viewer do not believe film story and these films have no effect on their audience. When you are writing a story or a screenplay you should make a logical structure for your story, all events should base on a logical cause. Sometimes there are some accidental events in a film, if these events do not be base of a film this is not a problem. all audience accept these events if all the film do not base on these events. If a film be based on accident and it can attract its audience and can make extraordinary sale same Atonement, this is not reason for its screenplay powerful, maybe this film contain of powerful director."

While the storyline was some what enjoyable, the ending lacked any excitement. It was rather slow and predictable. <br/><br/>I have to say that the worst part to watch throughout this movie was the ending. At the beginning of movie you sort of figure that the couple will be together eventually after going through so much hardship. That however, is not the case, as they fast forward to the future you realise that the sister was writing a book/novel and that the most important parts of the movie were in fact all a lie.

","With Atonement, his second feature film, Wright delivers a no-holds- barred, sweeping romance, with palpable echoes of classic epics such as Gone with the Wind, Casablanca and The English Patient, with their passionate love stories hindered or smothered by war, egoism and human cruelty. But at its seething core, Atonement is really about the brutal, painful awakening of a child struggling to come to terms with one senseless, venomous act she committed and that haunts her. The parallel with Gone with the Wind is facile, and there are numerous sequences, from a grueling hospital scene to a bravura war set-piece, that are reminiscent of the latter's epic grandeur and virtuoso, unflinching cinematic approach. But Atonement is something quite unique...<br/><br/>An unforgettable combo of visual virtuosity, romance and drama, Atonement is a powerhouse motion picture, superbly acted, which reaches vertiginous heights of visceral intensity and immediacy.

","Atonement Story: Based on the novel from Ian McEwan, this is one of the best adaptations I have seen (if not the best). This is a story about the power of lie. Story about guilt, feeling of guilt and also as title suggests atonement. Atonement is a romantic but very sad story, but it is also very beautiful. And I liked characters form the movie because they were live characters, very credible ones. <br/><br/>Acting: Three actresses playing the same character in different time – Ronan, Garai and Redgrave are all great. I would say most impressive is Ronan, who is not better then Redgrave but considering she was thirteen at the time she was incredible. James McAwoy gives a terrific nuanced and subtle performance. His calm and intelligence is great. He plays the calm, intelligent but very self assured young man, son of the maid just perfectly. Knightley also conveys her character in superb way. In the beginning under a cold and sharp behavior, you can see she is boiling pot of emotions and when they burst out it is really impressive. Then she plays passionate, loving girl who also upon meeting those she considers enemy can be cold and sharp again. All her three character positions are played beautifully. I think it is a shame that those two did not get at least Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>Directing and camera: This film is just beautiful, full of great scenes. You really feel what is happening: hot summer afternoon, summer night, incredible chaos of beaches of Dunkirk or chaotic scenes from hospital. Joe Wright is really a master of ""moody"" scenes. Great one was the ling scene from Dunkirk, which is one of the most impressive scenes I have seen. <br/><br/>Music: Very good and greatly put into the movie. Also very clever was the use of the typewriter sound in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion: One of my favorite films. Beautifully shot, with good music and great performances most notably form McAwoy and Knightley (who is also incredibly beautiful and wears the famous green dress). Also story is very good and it will not let you go long after the movie ends."

","Sadly I have read many articles on this film in which critics have pedantically pointed out the faults with this film. Yes, no doubt, there is always the risk of achieving historical inaccuracies when shooting films set in the past, that's a given. However to those who take pride in picking apart every single fault, maybe you should stop wasting your time, sit back and admire the sheer technological and performing brilliance of this feature.<br/><br/>James McAvoy and Keira Knightley are two of Britain's most aspiring first class actors, and in this film they really show it. After all, this film is a love story, so the convincing chemistry between the actors is highly important. Luckily both performances fit this specification perfectly, and what the audience are treated to is a romance which breaks all the boundaries. The story begins on a country estate in Southern England with 13 year old Briony Tallis, an ambitious, intelligent, aspiring young play- write. Upon seeing her sister Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) by the fountain with gardener Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) she develops an irrational vendetta against the latter based a series of misinterpreted events through her childish imagination. Finally, she accuses the Cambridge graduate of a crime he didn't commit, causing repercussions for the whole family.<br/><br/>What follows is a tantalising, fast paced films which incorporates a healthy mix of elements which puts the film as a half romance half thriller. The Film splits off into a triple narrative, exploring the lives of Robbie, Cecilia and eventually Briony as the country is struck by the effects of WWII. Here the film breaks new boundaries, including a stunning continuous shot of the scene at Dunkirk as well as the trials and tribulations of working at a wartime hospital.<br/><br/>What is never lost is the chemistry between the lovers. Despite them being apart for much of the latter part of the film, it encapsulates the struggles of putting a relationship to the test. The film never looses out on its romantic side, striking a poignant chord with the audience, allowing you to really understand the deep connection between the two protagonists.<br/><br/>In terms of its thriller elements, the fast pace is achieved partly through its commendable score, considered usage of 'type-writer' noises during Briony's scenes to not only achieve tension but to also exemplify her unfailing imagination. Additionally, through successful characterisation we are able to view the changing emotions plaguing her as she comes to term with the wrongs she has committed.<br/><br/>All in all, what this films represents is a pioneering adaptation which succeeds in delivering a near faultless drama consisting of all the right elements. Graced by superb performances, considered camera usage, developed characterisation and an emotional score, this film will leave you stunned. It successfully analyses the consequences of childish misinterpretation and the taxing battles for retribution and redemption in a context which keeps the audience guessing throughout. This film is not just a film, it is a love story, thriller and even a war film, all rolled into an emotional journey of determination which never fails in delivering.<br/><br/>82/100"

It's as if a traditional romantic movie has been injected with a massive dose of realism to bring it into the real world, with not always happy results.<br/><br/>One or two plot contrivances aside, I was compelled by every minute of this production. I also saw two actors, McAvoy and Knightley, give fine, subtle performances that I hadn't witnessed in either of them before. Especially Knightley, who I usually see playing simpering characters in the likes of those pirate films.<br/><br/>Joe Wright - who also directed Knightley in the 2005 PRIDE AND PREJUDICE adaptation - does a brilliant job of getting the tone and mood just right. His five-minute tracking shot of the Dunkirk beaches is breathtaking and on par with those seen recently in CHILDREN OF MEN and WARRIOR KING.<br/><br/>Kudos too for the inclusion of some unreliable narration in the latter stages, something films usually avoid in fear of alienating viewers. It works perfectly here."

","Atonement is a brilliant adaptation for the screen of Ian McEwan's World War II dark, mis-casted romance of Robey Turner (James McAvoy) and ""C"" Tallis (Keira Knightley). The division of Christopher Hampton's brilliant screenplay into three principal parts, first set pre-war on an English country manor, then four years later in the midst of the disaster at Dunkirk, and then 60 years later in post-war Britain follows in the main the direction of McEwan's popular novel. It avoids the oppressive ennui of the first 50 pages of the McEwan novel by focusing directly on the major theme of the work, the misinterpretation of an adult event seen through immature teenage eyes. <br/><br/>To emphasize the point, Christopher Hampton uses a technique that violates the cardinal rule of story telling employing a multiple perspective on a particular scene. <br/><br/>The first part of the screenplay faithfully follows the book without venturing into the book's tedium.<br/><br/>The matriarch of the Estate, suffering in the summer heat from a migraine, laments that warm weather leads to immoral conduct. Age 13, Briony Tallis, ""C's"" teenage sister, is particularly attentive. Having caught the servant's son Robey and her patrician sister in 'fond embrace' in the Manor's library, Briony has persuaded herself that Robey is a sex maniac. When she spies her 16 year old cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) out in the bushes with guest Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch), Briony cries rape and accuses Robey. Out of convenience or indifference, the elite prosecute Robey who is whisked off the prison with ""C"" crying ""Come back to me.""<br/><br/>Part II of the movie is fairly faithful to the book. Indeed in Part II, the action in the book becomes somewhat lively and interesting. <br/><br/>Flash ahead four years, Robey is out of stir in the fire of battle on the continent with the ""John Bull"" type Tommy Nettles (Daniel Mays)and the colonial sergeant Frank Mace (Nonso Anozie). Nettles complains ""give the Jerries the continent; the French hate us anyway. Lets keep our Empire."" Robey promises a kindly French farmer that the British will return. The Colonial emblematic for what was to come drifts away.<br/><br/>Rescued from Dunkirk, Robey reunites with ""C."" Briony tearfully promises to atone, to set the record straight. Is this a formula Hollywood ending?<br/><br/>Flash ahead 40 years to Part III for the surprise which is delivered with a bang. The ending differs from the book. The movie ending is well played and short, but one wonders whether Briony is atoning or bragging.<br/><br/>The book's ending is more drawn out and leaves a different question most subtly: Did Briony make the whole thing up?<br/><br/>The story is typically English with the long time gaps. I might have thought Robey's trial and conviction too interesting to leave out."

","This movie brought me in tears. The story was well written and impeccably directed. Joe Wright certainly created a master piece. Ian McEwan should be equally credited and praised as he came up with such a brilliant story. <br/><br/>Atonement is a story about an act of penance that Briony Tallis ( Cecilia Tallis's younger sister ) does in order to punish herself for a sin that entailed separating two lovers Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis ( James Mcavoy and Keira Knightley ) by a wrong decision of hers in the past. A man who was falsely accused of a crime, Robbie Turner ends up in jail and after which he goes to war during the German invasion thus getting his dream of joining medical school shattered. Cecilia leaves her family for Robbie and waits for his return from the war. Briony's false and juvenile accusation changes the lives of them for which she, after the realization of the truth, feels extremely sorry and thus tries to atone herself by giving up her further studies and working as a nurse. It is a very emotional story that would definitely compel you to sympathize with the characters of Robbie and Cecilia. A drama with emotions. It is something that tells us about the human mind. How abominable it is. How fickle emotions are. They can obscure the truth no matter how clear things are. Hatred, envy and wrath - they alone can bring down the world. They can mess up the life of those who stand in the way and one might not even get an opportunity to atone for those awful feelings.<br/><br/>The screenplay was brilliant. The music was equally apposite. The pace of the movie was really well thought of. The moments of silence really gushed in thousands of thoughts to my brain. What if nothing had gone wrong ? What if the real miscreant was put behind the bars ? While I watched wishing things to end happily it certainly did not albeit it brought a sour taste eventually but it also came with a queer satisfaction of the act of atonement nourishing itself though with some bitter tinge of reality attached with it.<br/><br/>The photography was lovely. The plight of the soldiers was well depicted during the time of the war. I didn't find anything wrong with the movie. It was well thought of and was well directed. An 8 on 10 would be my rating for this flick."
"Eternality","8","0","1","29 July 2010"," Atonement is a motion picture of two halves. Seductive at first, but declines later on.
","Nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, Atonement is the second major literary adaptation of a novel by director Joe Wright after Pride And Prejudice. In my opinion, Atonement is an overrated British period romance drama. Just because it looks great, works like a Shakespearean play, and boasts a strong, talented main cast does not, by default, imply that the film is Oscar-worthy. While it deserves nominations in the technical categories, and is generally an impressive picture, Atonement is not as consistent as some of 2007's best films.<br/><br/>Atonement is a motion picture of two halves. The first hour is thoroughly enjoyable; the story centers around three characters - Briony, Cecilia, Robbie - whose portrayals by Saoirse Ronan, Keira Knightley, James McAvoy respectively are excellent. The screenplay is written in such a way that it incorporates the flashback technique, which is vital for the film because certain scenes are seen from differing points of view and maturity level, and are such interpreted in an entirely different context.<br/><br/>Furthermore, through the use of the sound of a typewriter, Oscar-nominated composer Dario Marianelli manages effectively to bring about sudden changes in pacing by varying the - 'tuck, tuck-tuck, tuck-tuck-tuck' - rhythm along with the editing. All these elements make the first half a seductively thrilling one. Unfortunately, the second hour is a far cry from the first. We witness a dramatic drop in quality of acting (mainly the fault of the supporting cast), a less-tightly structured storyline, and a director unsure of the film's final objectives.<br/><br/>Atonement started its decline after Romola Garai took over young Ronan for the role of Briony. In fact, the role of Briony is very crucial to the film; to ask three different actresses (especially when the final two's acting capabilities are not up to the task) to take such a demanding role is suicidal. If not for Knightley and McAvoy, great visuals and art direction, Atonement would have fared worse than Michael Clayton, which I feel is the year's most ridiculous Best Picture nominee.<br/><br/>SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","An imaginative and spoiled child of a rich family accuses a servant of sexual abuse, leading to tragic consequences. Director Wright brings an astonishing visual elegance to the film, so much so that many of the shots look contrived, but one can't help but admire the beauty of the compositions. There is a cut-free five-minute tracking shot of soldiers on Dunkirk beach. Basically, Wright is showing off with this shot, but it's still impressive. Not impressive enough, however, to nab him an Oscar nomination for Best Director. The acting is excellent, particularly McAvoy as the servant boy and Garai as his accuser at an older age, seeking atonement for her actions as a child."

The lie changes all their lives, with consequences that extend beyond World War II.<br/><br/>This remarkably lavish, visually ravishing film does full justice to Ian McEwan's brilliant, detailed source novel. Director Joe Wright skilfully evokes the atmosphere of languid lust in the first act, and surpasses himself with a nightmarish evocation of the chaos and misery on the beach at Dunkirk, brought to life in a single five-minute tracking shot. A short triumphant coda with Vanessa Redgrave as an older, successful Briony, voicing her regrets, confirms Atonement as a rarity: a sumptuous spectacle with vast reserves of intelligence. Dario Marianelli's lush, romantic score includes a theme featuring the tapping of typewriter keys, a reminder that this is a story about storytelling."

I dunno if it was just me, but I was so affected by this film that I barely remember even leaving the theater afterward. It weighed heavy on my mind for over a week. It is the story of a young girl's selfish actions and the consequences those actions have on the people she loves the most. It is gorgeously directed by Joe Wright, who had previously debuted with Pride and Prejudice. Watch for the tracking shot on the beaches at Dunkirk. Flawless. <br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal on every level. James McAvoy and Keira Knightley sizzle as two lovers whose fates stem directly from one misunderstanding. Saoirse Ronan, who was twelve when she did this film, is a revelation as the young and naive sister of Keira Knightley.<br/><br/>I will reveal no spoilers here, but if you want an example of what happens fine storytelling, directing, and acting come together to make something beautiful and heartbreaking, Atonement is your movie."

","I saw this during its opening weekend in the theaters but never got around to commenting on it until now. This is a film about a girl who fabricates a lie that sends a guy to prison and tears apart a budding love and to atone for her actions she decides to wear the same hairstyle for the remaining 70 years of her life. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is a spoiled 13 year old rich brat who wants to be an author. Her older sister Cecilla (Keira Knightley) and the housekeepers son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) have a thing for each other in a sexual tension kind of way but Briony likes Robbie too but Robbie scolds Briony down at the swimming hole and gets on her wrong side. spying on Robbie and Cecilla she misinterprets something between them and grows to like Robbie even less. Robbie writes Cecilla a dirty love letter and they finally consummate their passion in a quickly in the library. This is the only romance in the movie and your supposed to believe that it sets the stage for years of undying love between Robbie and Cecilla as they are separated forever by prison and war. A family friend Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch) who owns a chocolate factory visits the Taliis' and ends up molesting their cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) and he comes to the diner table with scratches visible but nobody puts two and two together. Lola's twin brothers run away one night and a search party is formed to search the estate grounds for them. Paul takes the opportunity of the secluded darkness to force himself on Lola. Briony says she saw the rapist and it was Robbie. Robbie is the only one who couldn't have done it as he is far away from the scene having found the lost boys and is bringing them back but everybody believes Briony and Robbie gets sent to prison only to be let out if he agrees to fight in the front lines of world War II. And on and on this ridiculous story goes in the screen adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel by Hampton. Ramola Garai plays Briony at age 18 and Vanessa Redgrave plays Briony at 80. Wonderful cinematography by Seaus McGarvey and production design by Sarah Greenwood with art direction from Ian Baile but its like a decorated wedding cake. Pretty to look at but not much dietary value except for the Dunkirk scene. I would give this a 5.5 out of 10."

I found myself watching this with only half-interest when the film kept going in reverse and setting up what the younger sister saw, then finding myself more interested as McAvoy found himself in the war, trying to safely get home.

The first 1/4 of the movie sets up the incident nicely, but the rest of the movie seems a bit slow. I'd say that it's even easy to predict. There is a good plot twist at the end, so aside from the beginning, this is the other strong point of the movie.<br/><br/>If you've read the novel, it's a good bet (based on readers' reviews) that you'll like this movie.

"Lejink","7","0","1","23 November 2008"," What a difference a day makes...
","Not having read the source novel, I came to this much-praised adaptation with open eyes and ears and left at the end impressed by its undoubted polish and keen insight into the damaged psyches of its ill-served star-crossed lovers, played with credibility and engagement by young talents McAvoy and Knightley. For me, there were minor echoes of Joseph Losey's work of the 60's and 70's, borrowing a little of the multiple viewpoint technique of ""Accident"" and the retrospective narrative-framing style of ""The Go-Between"" (not to mention the latter's shared theme of the innocence of teenage children corrupted by a too-close proximity to the physical passions of their elders). Beautifully if a little showily shot and excellently played, the careful plotting is stylishly arranged for the viewer and to me only drags occasionally, with too-long scenes involving the hapless, exiled gone-for-a-soldier Robbie (McAvoy) winding up at the apparently shambolic Dunkirk beaches before ""The Miracle"" evacuation took place and ""18 year-old Briony's"" scene at the hospital with a dying French soldier. Well shot and acted as these scenes are, (the former, in particular, featuring a too-deliberately flashy ""Tara""/""Gone With The Wind""-type 5-minute tracking shot passing through the Dunkirk site), for me pointed up a detrimental stylisation at play here and also slowed down the action too much especially as the final denouement is so effective in its ingenious invention and crisp depiction. Pre-War England is beautifully conveyed in its mansion-house glory, but beneath the veneer of manners and respectability seething passions drive the inhabitants, young and old, to extreme courses of action which change their lives forever. Although built around the strong performances of lovers McAvoy (natural and humane) and Knightley (ethereal and passionate), the remainder of the acting is also completely in simpatico, with the three actresses who depict the maturing touch-paper-lighting Briony, doing so to excellent effect. If in the end a touch too mannered and clever for its own good, this well-made film shows that even today imaginative period drama can entertain far better than any number of comic-book hero extravaganzas. Sadly ironic in a postscript that this was one of the final appearances by another purveyor of quality drama, the late Anthony Minghella, in a brief, almost unnoticed part as the elderly Briony's TV interviewer. One suspects he would very much have approved of director Wright and his team's work here."

Joe Wright directed this with exceptional flair. The cinematography was excellent. Some beautiful compositions and the colours were ravishing and there was a real sense of scale to many of the big set pieces. My reservations are that despite everything I wasn't as moved by the climax as I felt I was supposed to be. I felt that much effort had been made to build to an emotional resolution but somehow it left me feeling cold. Something about it felt a little contrived for my taste. I read the novel shortly afterwards and I can see that something about the climax is more satisfying in novel form."

"derekcreedon","Null","0","1","13 July 2008"," the Romance that never was ...
","It all begins as country-house intrigue with a touch of THE GO-BETWEEN, crucial letters being passed and a confused child gradually overwhelmed by adult carryings-on. Young Briony's initial misunderstanding of an exchange between big sister Cecilia and the housekeeper's son Robbie seems a valid premise but when Robbie gets his letters mixed-up it sounds a warning note that things might not proceed as subtly as hoped for. And so it proves. Briony's shock-horror observations start piling up quicker than corpses in a Christie - sex in the library between Cee and Robbie (high-toned and balletic), another handy letter, the search for the runaway boys, sex in the woods (dirty and grubby) between a pervy guest and Briony's underage cousin - and before you can say Gregory Peck in SPELLBOUND -which also leapfrogged over a trial very glibly - Robbie the working-class scapegoat is banged up in the slammer for rape on the fevered say-so of Briony who'd previously idolised him. The left-wing playwright Lillian Hellman had employed a similar device in THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, dodging the finer details of an enquiry in order to pour coals on the head of her chosen target, the wealthy old lady who'd dared to believe her grand-daughter's story. Human understanding goes out the window when a class-warrior's on the march. Briony here is as much a victim of circumstance - or melodrama - as the hapless Robbie but the film affords her no sympathy then or later. She was only a kid for God's sake - but a Child of Her Class, nuff said. It's tempting to imagine that if Robbie had been a true-born son of the house the film might never have been made. It's also tempting to consider that if he had been a true gent he might have acted less like a chump earlier on - maybe, maybe not. Anyway the family freezes him out on Briony's evidence except for Cee whose (literally) one-night stand has blossomed into True Love.<br/><br/>Extending the Selznick analogy we broaden scale into A FAREWELL TO ARMS one World War down the line. Cee is now a comely nurse in 1940 London and Robbie's a reluctant soldier, released from prison to join the Army. After a pained parting modelled a little too clearly on BRIEF ENCOUNTER Robbie's sent to France where he's caught up in the retreat from Dunkirk. Trudging across country to the beach he has a neat chest-wound and two companions, the regulation bolshie cockney and a large mysterious black corporal with his head bandaged who seems to have been parachuted in via the Twilight Zone from some Regiment of Political Correctness, Rainbow Division. The big beach-scene - much acclaimed - is the Selznick-type set-piece, a technically accomplished interweaving of impressionist elements, singing Tommies, horses being shot (simulated, thankfully), the crowds awaiting evacuation. The inevitable Brenda Blethyn turns up later on in a dream-moment as Robbie's mum who bathes his feet (prior to his Crucifixion ?). Back in London the adult Briony, also a nurse, is introduced in a hospital scene rather like Maria with the nuns in THE SOUND OF MUSIC. We almost expect a number or two but no such luck. She wanders around in a daze seeking redemption after gradually realising She Got It All Wrong through a series of Amazing Coincidences involving some faked-up newsreel footage that are totally unbelievable and the film's clearest indication that it's headed for a defeat that, unlike Dunkirk, won't turn into victory. She pays a visit to the reunited lovers begging forgiveness. Robbie gives her a blistering lecture and sends her off again to Put It All Right.<br/><br/>Another left-wing heavyweight Vanessa Redgrave is enlisted at the end to 'apologise for slavery' so to speak, depicting Briony as finally a cracked and dying old best-selling novelist disclosing in a television interview before the shock-horrified nation, presumably, that the confrontation we'd just seen in the film never took place. Robbie had died from his wound in France and Cee had been killed in a gas explosion on the Underground (suitably spectacular as this is a Big Film don't forget). Briony will Put It All Right by telling their story in her final novel and giving it a 'happy ending'. Ingmar Bergman would have had a field-day with all this narrative-trickery and writer's angst. Unfortunately Joe Wright and his unlucky screenwriter can only adopt a relatively head-on approach in keeping with the nature of the production. (Ingmar didn't do the Odeon). Ironically a tad more of the Selznick spirit might have salvaged the cottage-by-the-sea. Old Hollywood was fond of Ghostly Lovers, David O. certainly was. His adored Jennifer played a ghost in PORTRAIT OF JENNIE and even Pearl Chavez in DUEL IN THE SUN was 're-born' as a desert-flower. Perhaps the real problem here is that the lovers don't register strongly enough in life to become potent symbols of an after-death. They remain Briony's creatures. Maybe they always were..."

","Well, just like most of the good movies I watch, I had to download Atonement to watch it, since the city does not approve of bringing critically acclaimed films to the theaters. Let's all go and watch Air Buddies(that too in Hindi). Yaaa whatever.<br/><br/>Well, browsing through IMDb, I found myself caught onto the home page of this movie. Read a review, liked it. Didn't know anything about the story except that it was set in wartime England or something. Searched it up, downloaded it. Watched it. Wow!! Atonement comes from Director Joe Wright, director of the critically acclaimed Pride and Prejudice(2005), with Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, and is based on the novel of the same name written by Ian McEwan. It also happens to be the movie that kick-started The 2007 Venice International Film Festival.<br/><br/>Well, all of that aside, the first thing that struck me while watching the very opening scenes of Atonement, was the background music. It's hooked with a typewriter, and sounds like something I've never heard before. It's a very very integral part of the movie, mind you, and is something that might just make anyone go,""Damn! Now why didn't I think of that?"" .. It's only that good.<br/><br/>Atonement does not have an ensemble cast. Keira Knightley shows us how much it is she's matured over the years. See this and compare it with her role as a Bounty Hunter in Domino. The results are shocking, and outstanding. The lead actor, James McAvoy, is someone you might recognize. But,""What's his name?"" you'll go. He was the one who played the fawn, Mr.Tumnus, in The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe. And was also there in The Last King of Scotland. A known face, yet unrecognized by many.<br/><br/>To put things straight, the acting is spot on. From the little 13 year old Brionny Tallis(Saoirse Ronan) who expresses situations oh so easily it seems; to her older 18 year old version(;Romola Garai) jumping to her elder sister Cecilia(Keira Knightley) who(still thinner than you can imagine) gives us as much of a visual treat as one can ask for. It would come as something of a surprise to me if James McAvoy is not nominated for an Oscar for his role as Robbie Turner. He is what keeps you captivated to the screen. Young, dashing, almost flawless. Walking through a beach-camp. No words, nothing.. Just visuals. Created, not CGI.<br/><br/>Certain scenes.. One being the long walk down the beach. The only love-making scene of the movie, in palled darkness, passionate, in a library. Amazingly done. The five minutes where Brionny sits and converses with a soldier in the hospital. The very opening scene, focusing on a herd of plastic animals as the young Brionny applies finishing touches to her play, The Trials of Arabella. Twice the opening music is played, the exact same. At both introductions to the young Tallis. One, when she's 13; the other when she's 18. A genius concept.<br/><br/>The panning of the camera, the cinematography, the editing(allowing you to look at something you want to for an elongated period of time, and vice versa), everything has a high amount of graphic detail, making it even more attractive. The musical jumps, with the typewriter clicking in the background. Actually, I could sit and write a whole review on just the background music of the film.<br/><br/>The story is simple. About a misunderstanding, mistaken innocence, and perhaps a little more. The desires of the young, seemingly mature, yet not so. A juvenile crush. Revenge. Anger. Most of all, jealousy. Ian McAvoy is a master storyteller. One must read the book to get the whole impact of this brilliant story. It is simply riveting.<br/><br/>The storyline being the main driving source of the movie, you will be hooked, from beginning to end. It's just the quality of the picture. It leaves a benchmark for all the others. Atonement is, quite simply, one of the best films of 2007. It's a pity that us Calcuttans aren't allowed to go and see films like these in the theaters. They deserve some amount of attention from the Central Board of Film Certification. Are you listening, Sharmila Tagore? A fair 8/10. Loved the ending a lot. And, do I need to start blabbing about the background score again?"

","Atonement is beautiful -every scene is a work of art,the soundtrack is incredible and the actors for the most part are pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the reason I did not rate this movie ten out of ten. In short it was Keira Knightley. I honestly don't know what everybody's on about. I found her acting stiff and cold-the younger bryony at the start out acted her!Her make-up and costume is also wrong in every scene - which really confuses me because everybody else's make-up and costume fit the times exactly.<br/><br/>If you're gonna watch it, see it for the other fabulous actors and try to bear through Knightleys scenes."

","Me being in 11th grade with a job at a restaurant I don't get much time to myself, and what little time I do get I usually spend it with friends. When one of my friends asked me if I would go with her to see Atonement, my initial reaction was what the hell would I want to see a movie like Atonement? When I got home that day I looked it up and found that it was a book written by an (apparently very talented Author.) Ian McEwan I think. Anyways we went with a few friends to the theater that Friday, most of my friends said to hell with it and went to see some other film. We decided to go see Atonement.<br/><br/>I can happily say no matter what my friends do, that Atonement was an absolutely perfect movie. Everything in it was great, the direction, the pace, cinematography, and especially the acting. Kierra Knightly was an absolute joy to watch. The girl who plays Briony, while older and while younger was Excellent! It did such a good job at making the viewers actually feel like the people in the movie were all very real. Almost every single scene in the movie was an absolute landscape, it left nothing out from what was supposed to be imposed. <br/><br/>Honest to God I cant find anything about it that was done wrong, save for maybe the length. When Briony Tallis lies to the family and says that Robbie (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE OR BOOK) raped the little red head girl (Lolla I think) while everyone was out searching for the twins you can see the naive look in her eyes, an almost sense of Haha. It makes you almost want to laugh at her stupidity. I cant even go into the development of the characters in the movie, its toooo in depth. Let me rephrase that its perfect. Each part in the movie is made so well that you personally feel attached to that individual.. The only thing that I would have to advise against is taking children, parts in the movie can get pretty.....Vulgar, dialog mainly, though its a great movie and very enjoyable<br/><br/>~Hope this helps~ Read the book!"
"javaman-7","8","0","1","11 April 2008"," Briony's betrayal echoes through the decades
","Java Man Reviews ""Atonement"" (Rated R). Directed by Joe Wright. Written by Christopher Hampton, based on the novel by Ian McEwan. Starring Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, Vanessa Redgrave & Brenda Blethyn. Running Time: 123 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>In this cinematic adaptation of Ian McEwan's best-seller, the filmmakers take us back to the Tallis country house in 1935 rural England. Here, 13 year-old Briony Tallis (Ronan) sees her sister Cecilia (Knightley) in a romantic embrace with Robbie Turner (McAvoy), the son of one of the family's servants (Blethyn). Because of her naivety, and her confused feelings for her sister's suitor, Briony falsely accuses the young man of committing a sex crime. The story then weaves back and forth through time, as the emotional consequences of Briony's betrayal echo through the decades. The film follows the three characters, now sadly separated, as they encounter the ravages of World War II. Brionyfirst as a young war-time nurse (Garai) and later as an elderly woman (Redgrave)is constantly trying to find a way to atone for her unforgivable falsehood.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 Java Mugs out of 4 <br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, young Briony taps relentlessly on a typewriter as she composes a play for her family. The rat-a-tat-tat of a typist typing continues throughout the film, and is a major component of the film's Oscar-winning score (Atonement's only win out of 7 nods), Though it threatens to become annoying, there is a reason for it; I suggest you listen to the score, and make note of what is happening on the screen when you hear the unrelenting Underwood.<br/><br/>While the pacing of the film, especially in the opening sequences, seems slow, it does provide an opportunity to admire the exquisite art direction and set design that reveals the more leisurely lifestyle of England in the 1930s. Another reason to savor these slower scenes is to take pleasure in the appeal of Knightley, McAvoy and Ronan before their characters are overwhelmed by the harsh realities of war. Briony has three actors who define her complex character... Ronan and Redgrave who are brilliant, and Garai who gives a more conventional, less compelling portrayal.<br/><br/>The film's pace quickens as World War II approaches. In one remarkable scene, director Wright sets up a five-minute continuous tracking shot at Dunkirk Beach as the British soldiers are preparing to sail back to England. The moving camera captures the reality of war and its surreal elements as we follow Robbie past bombed-out buildings, burning boats, horses being shot and a performing choir. This is one of the best scenes of the year, and should take its place among such famous film feats as Orson Welles' opening shot in Touch of Evil (1958) and Robert Altman's homage to Welles in The Player (1992)."

","Not quite as bad as I thought it was going to be, given what I'd heard and read here and there but still very much The English Patient for the Heat Magazine crowd. Like Pride And Prejudice the direction is strong, probably a bit earnest and the Dunkirk scene was pretty amazing if striving a bit too hard. I thought the story was interesting but the problem was the two leads who were out of their depth. Funnily enough I felt that it was McAvoy who was the weaker of the two as Knightley did manage to generate a couple of acting moments but all too often it felt a bit Harry Enfield when they were trying to deliver their meaningful dialogue. In comparison to The English Patient where it felt completely natural for the characters to talk in that stylised luvvie dialogue, here it just wasn't working and as a consequence it was difficult to feel the characters' emotions so much so that when the emotional wrench does come it falls a bit flat. If they'd have gone with leads that were a bit more mature and had a bit more presence it might have worked but I still think there'd be a bit of a issue with the source material."
"ayLn","6","0","1","30 March 2008"," nice screening but weird story
","It is definitely true that Atonement is not a usual movie. Probably, there is not a similar one. Story starts with little girl, Briony, writing a play to welcome her brother. This writing scheme continues through out the movie and makes a perfect combination with typewriter sound based musics of the movie. Beautiful nature of the summer house adds more points to movie. Cecilia, smoking so often, being sassy, maybe arrogant at the beginning turns out to be a very brave woman who is going after her love. With her stunning green dress at the dinner, deserves to take her place in the classic woman characters of cinema. Finally the movie turns back to focusing on Briony's compunction, and makes you expect that she'll find a way to change things into good, somehow. However movie disappoints and ends in a weird way that Briony never acts brave enough and struggles for good."

","Joe Wright's second feature film (after 2005's Pride & Prejudice) has its leading lady in common with his first and this, unfortunately, is my main bone of contention with his, otherwise magnificent, movie. For me, at least, her clipped English accent is unconvincing and contrived. In interviews she has herself stated that she enjoyed the reversion to a 30's/40's-style of acting and, in particular, the Brief Encounteresque bullet-like speech patterns but this is so affected that it's borderline parody. I'm not a fan of the wartime posh English accent at the best of times and it has put me off many an adaptation of a classic children's book (stand up Chronicles Of Narnia)- but for a modern lesson in 'how to', Ms Knightly could have done a lot worse (and she did) than to study Kristin Scott Thomas' performance in The English Patient. James McAvoy's accent also seems a little confused but, as his character is a social climber, we can let that one slide. <br/><br/>I am not obsessed with accents, by the way, I just think that the casting of these two of-the-moment actors was a mistake. Clearly not as far as the box office and press/public interest were concerned, but just in terms of authenticity. Keira Marmite-of-the-British-film-industry Knightly's appeal has always been a mystery to me but I have long been a fan of James McAvoy's work - which makes it all the more disappointing to see him miscast here. His performance is not without its merits and it utilises two of his best talents as an actor - working with children and crying - but the script, at times, insists on him (and Knightly) spouting the kind of contrived, wannabe-classic dialogue that only ever sounds good on trailers.<br/><br/>What makes these two performances all the more grating is that every other character is played spot on. Saoirse Ronan (pronounced SER-SHA, apparently) is a revelation as the young Briony and I was shocked to discover that she's Ameican/Irish - her accent's better than Keira Knightly's for gawd's sake. A special mention should also go to the criminally overlooked Romola Garai as the 'middle' Briony. Her role is critical in understanding the guilt and torment that leads to the film's title - and all of this she conveys with eyes and expression alone (now THAT'S acting, Keira).<br/><br/>Atonement the movie, though, is bigger than the sum of its acted parts and so a little hammy delivery of melodramatic dialogue can be forgiven - and some might even welcome it from an epic of this stature (Gone With The Wind would have been forgotten by now without it). Joe Wright's direction is confident, authentic, sympathetic and quite beautiful. Even the obligatory extended tracking shot (here of soldiers awaiting evacuation on the beach at Dunkirk) is so effective that you almost forget about the artistic contrivance of such a lengthy take. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography too is excellent - from the muggy sunlight of the film's first chapter (you can almost feel Keira Knightly's dress sticking to her as she tries to cool off on the damp grass) to the incessant fog of war in the second. The score by Dario Marianelli brings to mind Philip Glass' work on The Hours with its economical yet memorable melody lines, sparse piano/string arrangement and evocation of melancholy (interesting that Joe Wright chose to use that film's cinematographer here) but is given a sense of urgency by the use of a typewriter as a driving rhythm section. At first this grated and felt a bit like ""okay, we get it - this whole story pivots on the use of the written (typed) word"" but I grew to appreciate its effectiveness and even enjoy its punchy punctuation. Christopher Hampton (perhaps best known for his excellent English-language adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses for stage and screen) has written a decent script - those trailer-friendly lines aside - that works particularly well both in establishing the characters and their motivations at the beginning of the film and at the end, where Vanessa Redgrave delivers (in the guise of a TV interview) an effective speech-cum-summation which, in the hands of a lesser writer, might have felt clunky and overstated.<br/><br/>This film is something of a modern classic - certainly more English Patient than Pearl Harbour - and Mr Wright has every right to feel proud of his achievement. I eagerly anticipate the release of his next film The Soloist - not least because it doesn't feature any Marmite. I hate Marmite."
"kclambeth","9","0","1","29 March 2008"," Visually beautiful
","I wasn't sure if i wanted to see this film as i'm not usually into romantic dramas, but this was something else, it's not just a 'man loves woman with lots of crying involved' plot; it's a beautiful, tragic story set in WWII.<br/><br/>The story starts in 1935 when 13 year old Briony- not understanding the situation between her sister Cecilia and their gardener Robbie- accuses Robbie of something he did not do, changing the three of their lives forever.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, especially James Mcavoy who was fantastic, Keira Knightly was great too and unfairly criticised i think, she is a fine actress who portrays Cecilia with great care. Saoirse Ronan and Romola Garai who play Briony are fantastic too and you really feel for her as she comes to terms with her actions but never overcomes the guilt she feels.<br/><br/>The cinematography, and the direction (by Joe Wright) is stunning, the palette of colours used are beautiful-from the rich greens and vibrant blues of England's countryside to the blacks, greys, browns and sepia's of Dunkirk. The beach scene at Dunkirk was probably the best visual piece in the film (or other film) I could watch it over again as i couldn't take my eyes off it. The beach scene was very moving, having Robbie walk along the beach in silence with just the chilling sounds of a small group of soldiers singing was very moving and showed the other side of the harshness of war, not just from battle sequences.<br/><br/>I highly recommended this film, the acting, direction and score is superb. I haven't read the novel so cannot comment on the adaptation factor, but as a film it is a memorable one. My whole family enjoyed this film, which doesn't happen often in a family with such different tastes. Atonement may not be everyones cup of tea, but i say give it a go just for the experience of it all."

","This film has so much going for it: A) 10 stars for cinematography. This is, honestly, one of the most beautifully photographed movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>B) 10 stars for the performances. I thought all the actors were fantastic. Keira Knightley is very good as Cecilia. James McAvoy gives an extremely strong performance as Robbie. All of the women who played the character of Briony are simply fantastic.<br/><br/>C) 10 stars for the editing. The ""chopped up"" presentation of events in a non-linear way, I thought, worked very well. This was an excellent way to present the varying points of view; Briony's vs. Cecilia's/Robbie's, etc. It also built tension and suspense, leading to a wonderful climax in the ultimate consummation of the romantic/sexual relationship of Cecilia and Robbie. Leading to...<br/><br/>D) 10 stars for the love story. Contrary to the opinions of many others, I thought the love affair of Cecilia and Robbie was very believable and true-to-life.<br/><br/>E) 10 stars for the focus on the need for atonement. I thought the middle portion of the film brilliantly portrayed the anguish that Briony suffers because of her false accusation resulting in Robbie's imprisonment. The overwhelming guilt that she endures because of the pain, suffering, estrangement, etc., that her sin of lying has caused in the lives of her family, her sister, and Robbie; as well her own life. Briony's acts of penance as she serves her time in the purgatory-like London hospital, and her attempt to confess to Cecilia and Robbie, all drive toward the heart of this film/story which is Briony's dire need for forgiveness - for atonement.<br/><br/>And then the film falls flat. I simply could not accept the film's ending. Briony, the now-famous (and terminally ill) author, writes her 21st and last novel as a confession of her sin, of her lying; a novel in which she re-writes history so that Cecilia and Robbie (who both died in The War) survive and live happily-ever-after. The scenes of confrontation and confession between Briony, Cecilia, and Robbie never actually happen. They were fictitious events that Briony created in order to tell her story as it ""should"" have happened. In her mind, this novel (which we the viewer learn, has been portrayed in everything that happens in the movie up to this point) has allowed her to right-her-wrong and she, apparently, doesn't feel guilty any more. Okay...<br/><br/>In other words - she's able to die with a clear conscience by living out her few remaining days in a fictionalized world of her own creation; a false reality, in which all's well that ends well. That may be a nice way of justifying her avoidance of doing the right thing. It's certainly a convenient way of assuaging her feelings of guilt. But it's NOT atonement! Atonement, by definition, is making amends; atonement is reconciliation. It's the repairing of broken relationships. Briony's re-writing of history does none of that. Her lie has destroyed people lives and has irreparably broken her relationships with her sister Cecilia and with Robbie. These relationships can never be mended, because the second parties died before Briony got up enough courage to recant, confess and ask for forgiveness. Therefore atonement is impossible. Ultimately, her re-writing of history is just another lie; a lie that might be able to make her feel better - but which can not, and does not, bring about atonement. It changes nothing.<br/><br/>Bottom line - this film is an extremely high technical achievement, which because of a false representation of the concept of 'atonement'(perhaps because of a misunderstanding of the concept on the part of the screenwriter, director, and/or the original novel's author) comes across in the end as shallow self-centered pop-psychology."

I have gone on record to say that all British movies must have Michael Caine talking all the male parts and Jane Seymour doing all the female parts. At least when those two speak I can understand what they are saying. Is that too much to ask? Apparently so. <br/><br/>The Academy gave a Best Picture nomination to this movie because they couldn't understand what was being said also, and because the movie was British and understandably superior to American movies, they raved to everyone about it.

And, there you have it.<br/><br/>I found the movie much too long. The war scenes went on forever. In fact I think they are still going on. This could have been a more satisfying movie if the idle chatter in the beginning among the idle rich and the war scenes were drastically cut back. They didn't need to be that long.

While watching the film, I had a lot of mixed emotions: sadness, disappointment, disgust, anger, and just about any other type of emotion that can be conjured. Not of the movie itself, but of the characters and how they are being portrayed. In that case the actors did an excellent job, and its certain that James McAvoy is an up and coming star. It is very hard for me to describe this film in such a way to express the impact that it has had on me--not that life changing type of deal--but of how it kept me thinking about it even a couple of days after watching it. Although as soon as I finished watching the film, I thought that the film was horrible. But those couple of days of thinking about it I began to realize that it was the complete opposite of that.

","The best movies and novels about ill-fated lovers are GONE WITH THE WIND, ROMEO AND JULIET, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, BRIEF ENCOUNTER, and WUTHERING HEIGHTS, which is my personal favorite. This movie tries to live up to those standards, especially A FAREWELL TO ARMS and WUTHERING HEIGHTS. <br/><br/>The film is set in three parts. In the beginning, we find our real-life young lovers, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley), a daughter from a wealthy family of aristocrats, and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). a proud gardener, who is the son of a housekeeper on the Tallis' estate. They develop a passionate romance over time. Cecilia's younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), wants to be a novelist and she also has a crush on Robbie. That's when things turn nasty. When Briony catches Cecilia and Robbie having romantic interludes, she develops resentment and jealousy towards Robbie. After a series of mishaps, Briony falsely accuses Robbie of rape and he is sent off to prison. As a result of this terrible situation, Cecilia starts to estrange herself from her family, especially Briony.<br/><br/>The second part of the film is set during the start of World War II, where Robbie has made a deal to avoid prison life and join the armed forces in France. Cecilia has become a nurse in London. During this time period, they write and try to make contact with each other. The Battle of Dunkirk ensues and Robbie must fight with Cecilia on his mind every step of the way. The special effects of the battle sequences, which make use of CGI technology, are very impressive. Will Cecilia and Robbie meet again after the war? I'm not going to say, even though others have shared additional comments regarding the end of the film. <br/><br/>The final moments of the movie are about Briony's test of atonement. By this time, Briony, too, has become a nurse and has prepared a novel that sheds light over her treatment of Cecilia and Robbie. The novel depicts a better life for the two lovers, despite their actual fate. The final moments of the film bring the movie into full circle, where an aging Briony (Vanessa Redgrave) explains the ""true"" facts of her novel to reporters. This is where the audience is left hanging. Some people wanted more from Cecilia and Robbie, but they get Briony's confession instead? Ouch, that hurts. Can you imagine if the director had shown the lovers' ""true"" fate and then Briony's last testament to the press? The tomatoes would have been REALLY flying at the screen! I guess that it is hard for most people to forgive, and even harder for some to say ""I'm sorry"".<br/><br/>Score: 8/10"

","This is a film that has had so much care lavished upon it in the making. The film has a stunning and authentic look, the performances are all very good and it is intelligently written. But it still does not work well for me. I'm not especially a fan of Ian McEwan and perhaps that is the problem. The film does not seem to me to establish the love affair between the two main characters to be as significant as it needs to be for the remainder of the film - I think that is a problem inherent in the book also (I've not read it, implied from the script though). I don't really care about any of these characters either, bourgeois Brits down on their luck, so tough. The mistake made by the young girl in lying and thus destroying her life as well as the lives of the lovers and disrupting their family relations is an interesting element. Most interesting is perhaps her continued arrogance depicted in her later years, when she is soon to die, for she continues to find truth a difficult concept to master.

","A very fascinating film. I'm kind of left still thinking about it. Honestly, it's a pretty devastating film to watch. Definitely, a film to remember. James McAvoy is without a doubt the main standout, nothing against Keira Knightly. But, McAvoy's performance really stood out to me.<br/><br/>I'm also left really creeped out by some of the characters involved. Especially, the characters of Lola & Paul Marshall ( who was the real rapist). Much is said about Briony's guilt, and yet Lola allows Robbie to take the blame as well, when she knows very well that it was Marshall who raped her. Or did he? Of course, we are only seeing things from Briony's view...but in the scenes between Lola and Marshall they are very openly flirting, not to mention the underhanded comments about how Lola wants to be more grown up and is trying to act like and adult. Of course-Lola ends up marrying her 'attacker' Marshall.....<br/><br/>Briony? Is she nothing more than a self-absorbed liar? I was really affected by Romola Garai's performance as the 18 year old nurse Briony. She really took up the young, naive, jealous, selfish 13 year old Briony (Saoirse Ronan) mannerisms, the way she talked etc. Garai is such an under-rated actress. I've liked her since I saw her in I Capture the Castle. She was also most recently in Amazing Grace. A very subtle actress, but in just one second or scene she can still manage to break your heart, it's all in the eyes.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most known scene of the film, is the one-take sequence of Dunkirk, which is nothing short of astonishing. Not just the look and feel of it, but the music of the scene as well. The connection among the soldiers. Especially when they sing hauntingly in the background. Tears your heart out."
"j-lacerra","8","0","1","10 February 2008"," Almost Great
","By all accounts, including mine, this is a beautiful movie. The astonishing attention to period detail, the beautiful cinematography, and the great panoramic embracing of the chaos of war make it a joy to watch. The acting is almost without exception perfect in all characters. Completely believable and without undue affectation.<br/><br/>Why not 10 stars instead of 8? This good movie suffers from a pacing that is sometimes too slow, and some initially confusing time shifts; where a key scene is played over from another perspective, we are unsure if Knightley is jumping into the (incredibly deep) fountain for a 2nd time, or the scene is being replayed. It is clarified quickly, but blows ones concentration on the plot. That's one star deducted.<br/><br/>And then there is the cadaverous Keira Knightly, who looks just terrible, like a victim of several famines. Her performance is fair, but she has all the sex appeal of a white stick, and thus makes it difficult to sympathize with her character, or even mildly understand McAvoy's desire for her. Another star deducted.<br/><br/>All in all a very worthwhile production and an enjoyable two hours."
"limaluisa5","8","0","1","10 February 2008"," Something was missing...
","I have spent the last 60 minutes reading other comments and I still haven't found one I totally agree with. Did I like the film? Of course I did. Did I surrender to it? No, unfortunately not and I even feel a bit lost because I wish I had. Maybe the whole problem lies in the fact that I loved the book so much. I remember feeling at one time inspired, overwhelmed, enraged, frustrated...while reading it. I remember hating Briony so much for what she had done that I almost felt like leaving the book unfinished because I couldn't bear the way it was going to end. And when I decided to watch the film I guess I was expecting to get all that magic back, but the magic only lasted for about 40 minutes. The first part of the film really corresponds to the image I kept in my mind, but then the poetic atmosphere sort of fades away. The performances are excellent although I must say I prefer Keira in Pride and Prejudice, but McAvoy proved to be an actor with a lot to give. The way McEwan's novel was adapted is also beyond reproach, so I guess it's my own fault that at the end of the film I was feeling as if something was missing."
"siderite","9","0","1","10 February 2008"," Well done drama
","Well, I was torn between grading it an 8 or a 9. My wife tipped the vote. You see, the movies that make her cry are good movies to her. The film is a snapshot of pre-war England and a few scenes during the war itself. The perspective of the characters changes so that we can see the different ways the story could have been told.<br/><br/>Now, what can I say? The level of detail makes this movie good. The acting is very nice. The soundtrack is good (and I especially liked the typewriter effect in the music that tells us without a shadow of a doubt that we are watching a movie based on a book, therefore it has a point).<br/><br/>All these qualities are included in my grade, but my personal opinion is not. You see, I am kind of tired of the emotional tension between people that have strong feelings towards each other, but that they cannot consume. Women find this romantic, I find it plain annoying. Well, of course, you would say, men are all about the consummation, but that's not the point. Does one feel better of their own lives when watching the pitiful mishaps of others? It doesn't work on me. Do I need to experience sadness from time to time in order to feel alive? Certainly not.<br/><br/>Therefore my conclusion is that this is a great film to see with your beloved, yet not one that actually has a point - except from a historical perspective. You don't get to learn any useful skills out of the movie, nor do you get to see some great new story that no one has seen before. It's just a plain old boring drama that is excellent crafted."
"Paddy-49","9","0","1","10 February 2008"," Brilliant film illuminates McEwan's fine novel
","Ian McEwan's novel was an astonishing achievement and both its structure and storyline presented difficulties for anyone who wanted to bring it to the screen. Joe Wright (Director) and Christopher Hampton (screenplay) have surmounted these difficulties with aplomb and produced a film which is not only 100% true to the original but which is a moving and creative work of art in its own right. The story is in three distinct parts. The first is about the tensions between two sisters and with a handsome young man - who is suitor to the elder - in an upper-middle class English family in 1935. There is an undercurrent of unease in this story - and when the climax comes it is no surprise. Passions, mendacity, jealousy, snobbery and ultimately violence bubble inexorably to the surface. The second part describes how the grievously hard-done-by young man from the first story gets caught up in the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. This is harrowingly complete and horrifically graphic in its gory detail. The third part shows how the now adult younger sister copes with her guilt in the aftermath of the tragedy of 1935 and also with her determined effort to atone, partly by training as a nurse in a military hospital. A gripping plot, brilliant writing and fine characterisations illuminate this movie  excellent performances both by both the principals and the supporting cast.<br/><br/>Atonement is really a three-hander. The elder sister is played with great subtlety and distinction by Keira Knightly  perhaps here finest screen performance to date. Her suitor, Robbie, is brought to life by James McAvoy who is quite outstanding in the war scenes. And the younger sister, Briony, is believably played as a child by Saoirse Ronan, and thoughtfully by Romola Garai as an 18-year-old. There is also a stunning cameo from Vanessa Redgrave as the 77-year-old Briony at the end of the film. The five minutes when Ms Redgrave is on screen is a small master class in acting that all drama students should study carefully! The cinematography is excellent throughout  especially the recreation of Dunkirk which is done absolutely without an ounce of sentimentality (as it should be). No small boats and brave Brits escaping to freedom here  just blood, sweat and tears. The same applies to the hospital scenes which might not be suitable for those with a weak stomach. But it certainly tells it as it was.<br/><br/>Finally it is worth recording that a minor subtext of McEwan's book is about the art of writing fiction  particularly about the writing of a realistic novel which is closely linked to real-life events. I wondered whether this would be tackled in the film, but it is and it works very well. For those who have seen the film but not read the book I heartily recommend McEwan's novel to you. They complement one another well and you are likely to be moved all over again when you turn the pages."
"thebengalimafia-1","10","0","1","9 February 2008"," The Best Film of 2007!
","Atonement opens with a blooming love between two young people and descends into a pit of sadness, angst, and loss. The film is set in 1930s England and follows the main characters into WWII. Young Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) has a vivid imagination which will be the death of the young lovers.<br/><br/>Cecelia Tallis is the daughter of a wealthy business man (we're never told what he does for a living, and we never see him for that matter). Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the grounds keeper was educated at the same schools as Cecelia by the grace of Cecelia's father. It was fun to watch Robbie and Cecelia around each other, with each one afraid to say what they're thinking. It was only by change they find out about each others feelings, in a library nonetheless. The two had their whole lives ahead of them until Cecelia's younger sister Briony comes along and turns their world upside down.<br/><br/>The fall of 2007 offered some of the best movies of the year; some were the best movies ever made. This is one film where I couldn't possibly describe in. I don't think there are enough words in the English language anyway (maybe I'll have to use Sanskrit). Atonement, simply put, is one of the best love stories I've ever seen. The picture perfect young romance is painted so beautifully that it makes you feel horrible when you find out the love is doomed to end. I think it's an unfulfilled love story rather than a happy ending that really gets the audience stirred up. I once read that realistic films don't make money and don't do well at the box office. Is there a difference between a realistic film and an honest one? Perhaps, Atonement is all about honesty. There is honesty in the acting, writing, directing; every frame of every scene. The film isn't mushy-gushy, it seemed more about devotion.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is terrific as Cecelia. Her on screen presence and demeanor are always full of energy and life; her performance was incredibly powerful but done with the utmost subtlety. She completely inhabited her character and has the posh, upper class British accent to go with it. The film moves forward to the heat of WWII and jumps back and forth from Robbie in France to Cecelia and an older Briony in England. Young Saoirse Ronan was leaps and bounds ahead of the older Briony (Romola Garai). I can't help but think that Briony's character was watered down as a result of Briony punishing herself for what she did to Cecelia and Robbie. She feels guilty for what she's done, and being a war nurse doesn't leave much time for being the carefree aspiring novelist she once was (or so we think). Briony's existence is the only part of the film that is dishonest. She spends her entire life lying to herself and living a charade; in doing so, she finds atonement.<br/><br/>This film had lavish sets and breathtaking cinematography. The way the colors look in some films today; I forget if I'm watching a live action movie or CGI. In Atonement, the sun rises and sun sets are as honest as any of the film's stellar performances. One of the most stunning scenes in the film is a five minute long, uncut tracking shot which thoroughly gives the audience a taste of France in WWII. I had never heard of director Joe Wright before this film, but I sincerely hope this is only the beginning of his career. Atonement is one of the year's best films, and will no doubt take the top spot at the Oscars."

","Beautiful movie, amazing imagery and even more amazing music, almost merged in the movie's atmosphere. Simplicity. Porcelain figures, such as Keira's, which stick to your mind for a long time. On the downside,little emotional charge, coming from the fact that most of the film is seen through the storyteller's eyes, at an age at which life is not understood, and with a mind out of this world. So be patient and give this movie the time to grow... You either like it or hate it, because cowardliness is in all of us, and it's one of our innate traits we hate most and never admit to it. This is why the movie is so tense, I think."
"seaview1","8","0","1","8 February 2008"," ATONEMENT and the Power of Love and Lies
","With the sweep of an epic and the intimacy of romance, Atonement comes across as a pretty good piece of period film-making until its devastating truths elevate the film to even greater heights. Joe Wright, who is becoming the torchbearer to period filmmakers, Ivory and Merchant (Room with a View), has been down this path before with his terrific Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>It is 1935 at a wealthy estate in England where two sisters contemplate life. The older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is at odds with the housekeeper's grown son, Robbie (James McAvoy). The younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), is an impressionable teen and budding writer. Cecilia's brother, Leon, arrives with a male friend, Paul, who takes keen interest in some children staying at the home. One evening, a passion erupts between Cecilia and Robbie that is interrupted by Briony. Later that night a girl is brutally assaulted by an unknown assailant. The subsequent allegations will have tragic consequences. The story shifts between London where Cecilia is a nurse and Dunkirk where Robbie fights to survive the early stages of World War II. The couple struggle to be reunited from afar even as a maturing Briony comes to terms with her past deeds. It is only later in life that she faces her guilt by paying tribute to the undying love of a tragic couple.<br/><br/>Atonement sets out to be an ambitious undertaking of love corrupted by outside forces and those from within as it spans the decades. It shows how mere words can hurt in ways that cannot be imagined. In this, the plot is not dissimilar to The Children's Hour where a child's words hurt deeply. The story focuses less about the horror and effects of war, and more on the purging and cleansing of sins. Briony chooses to deal with her misrepresentations and redeems herself with a final act of poetic justice (think Titanic), even if it takes a lifetime. <br/><br/>The film suffers a bit from confusing points of view as seen through the eyes of Briony by replaying the same scene to depict her point of view. What remains somewhat unclear are her motives. Is she jealous of the love between Cecilia and Robbie or is she making wild assumptions based on distortions?<br/><br/>The acting is quite good with teen Saoirse Ronan a standout as Briony. In fact, all three actresses who play Briony at various stages of life are a splendid tandem (much like the tandems in Shine or TV's Life with Judy Garland). <br/><br/>Almost functioning as a Greek tragedy, the film most people will compare this to is The English Patient, which is ironic because there is a scene that has a television interviewer played by Patient's director, Anthony Minghella! Atonement benefits from some good cinematography (Seamus McGarvey), which depicts some startling, surreal imagery especially in a tracking shot that says all that need be said of the horrifying evacuation of British troops at Dunkirk. The editing flashes back and forth to make a point or give background, and yet you wonder what is real or imagined. The musical score (Dano Marianelli) is in keeping with the dramatic mood quite nicely.<br/><br/>By the finale, we get to have an ending of sorts. Is it reality or the fabrication of an author's guilt-ridden imagination? One thing is for sure: the feelings of longing and love are real. Atonement is like reading an epic romance novel with a bit of Jane Austen thrown in for good measure. As such, it's pretty compelling."

","Love it or hate it - this is one lonnnng movie. It takes the better part of an hour just to get to the incident that would require atonement. And, it isn't so snappy at getting to the act of contrition, either. Fortunately, the resolution is brief.<br/><br/>As for a story, it is a tale of British Society - nuanced and developed by the actions and relationships of people within a manor house. It provides an intricate portrait of manners and repressed emotions - if such things interest you. There are many ""flashes"" - back, forward, and adolescent - which suggest that pubescent hormones and perceptions of sex could lead one to no longer be able to distinguish between Right & Wrong and that adolescence creates its own reality.<br/><br/>As a morality play, it is certainly unsatisfying. The act of atonement is in no measure commensurate to the gravity of the deed. Perhaps, that is the point? That a member of British Aristocracy would admit to any injustice or wrong should be sufficient atonement.<br/><br/>Definitely for the fans of British Society drama. For the addict, this is more than a quick fix; it is a wallow in the mores and manners of a British Yesteryear. The depiction Dunkirk and the war give great context to this period piece - ah, the Empire which was."
"jemps918","7","0","1","4 February 2008"," Not a very faithful adaptation of the book
","Not a very faithful adaptation of the book, and a lot of details were omitted: the history behind the broken vase, more of Robbie Turner (James McAvoy)'s horrible experiences while at war, the gypsy woman and her pig, what happened to Lola and Paul Marshall, why Briony couldn't publish her tell-all novel yet and how she ultimately celebrates her birthday at the old house.<br/><br/>The book was a bit annoying to read as author Ian McEwan did not allow readers to have their own imaginings; he painstakingly dictated each detail and embarrassingly disclosed each character's private thoughts, which of course, is impossible to translate on screen. But the beauty of the novel is the real ending (not the film's version), when it all comes together and explains why the book was written the way it was for the better part of the story.<br/><br/>But the film did justice to the lush backdrops as described in the book, and the characters are well cast. Except perhaps for James McAvoy, who acted superbly but needed to be a bit burlier and taller (Briony was taller than him during the confrontation when he was supposed to be intimidatingly towering over her!). The actresses who played Briony at 13, at 18 and in her 70s all possessed the face and the manner you'd love to hate. Keira Knightley was beautiful and played the role of the haughty, careless but passionate aristocrat Cecilia perfectly. Paul Marshall was supposed to have some disfiguring facial feature that made him even more despicable, and Lola Quincey was supposed to be slenderer and prettier, but Juno Temple's portrayal was eerily exact.<br/><br/>Visually arresting, the accompanying soundtrack and effects were also masterful, but the ending could've used a bit more help."

","Probably the best romantic movie of 2007, this is very much Brimley's story as portrayed by three actresses, child, young adult and elderly women. Even the scenes where she's not in it, it's her imagination as what transgressed between James McAvoy's and Keira Knightly's characters. <br/><br/>Brimley is a writer, established immediately in the first scene. Even the opening credits are in courier font and the ""music"" is typewriter noises. Brimley has written a play that her guests, a red head and twins are very reluctant to participate in. She looks out the window and sees her older sister disrobe herself in front of a handsome man and jump in the deep fountain. Moments later, she comes out and puts her outer garments on over her wet undergarments and Brimley's curiosity is completely buzzed as to what actually happened.<br/><br/>With a nod to Kurosawa, the action is repeated but this time with only McAvoy and Knightly present. This must be said here that they make a very lovely couple. There are other characters, a brother who's hardly in the movie and his friend who does the nasty with the red-hair that McAvoy will be falsely accused of. That fact doesn't get revealed right away because the second act is not told chronologically.<br/><br/>Just when you thought everything is all explained, fast forward to when Brimley is an established novelist, being interviewed for her twenty-first novel that she reveals whose atonement this really is. <br/><br/>Because the main character is a third person seeing the love story, there's a bit disengagement to the doomed couple. We know McAvoy couldn't have done the rape because he simply did not have the time. He was too busy bringing back the twins. He must have had a lousy lawyer because to jail he went and the redhead remained silent.<br/><br/>But overall, a very enjoyable movie. Great dialog, scenery and performances all around."

This is one of those films that must be watched more than once in order to fully grasp the symbolism and undertones presented in it. After watching Atonement, one gets the impression that the director and screenwriter have been very faithful to the book on which the film is based on. The continuous use of flashbacks gives the plot much needed development. All in all, it is a thoroughly modern film, sometimes perhaps a bit too modern for the time period it attempts to portray."
"ackstasis","7","0","2","20 January 2008"," ""I will return; find you, love you, marry you and live without shame.""
","Joe Wright's 'Atonement (2007)' is a film that, on its glossy surface, seems practically perfect. The director has constructed each scene so meticulously that every shot looks perfectly positioned, every actor seems perfectly chosen, and every line sounds perfectly spoken. In the process of engineering this perfection, the film loses part of its heart, any sense of imagination or daring discarded by Wright's unwillingness to put a foot wrong. Adapted from Ian McEwan's critically-acclaimed novel of the same name, 'Atonement' is nonetheless an intriguing war-time tale of jealousy, naiveté and regret, and it offers much in the way of entertainment, despite lacking in depth. It's the sort of picture that is, dare I say it, tailor-made to appeal to the Academy, and a Best Picture nomination is certainly forthcoming, and not altogether undeservedly. A solid cast, including Keira Knightley, James McAvoy and young Saoirse Ronan, occupy the lavish sets, beautifully captured by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey; visually, the film is a sumptuous feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>'Atonement' is divided into two distinct acts, contrasting violently between the luscious, sunny countryside of pre-WWII England, and the bitter, bleak, crumbling London that followed. The first act, probably the stronger of the two, takes place at a bright and cheerful country-house, where the eldest daughter in a proper English family, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley), falls in love with the household's handsome gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Younger sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), aged 13, witnesses this romance flourishing from her bedroom window, misunderstands the situation, and steadily builds a resentment towards Robbie, culminating in a final, selfish act of jealousy that forever wrenches the budding couple from each others' arms. The power of written-word plays a crucial role in the events of the film; it is Briony's interception of a sexually-explicit letter that proves vital in damning Robbie and Cecilia's future, and, in the tearful finale, an older Briony attempts to use written fiction as the only remaining means of correcting past mistakes and destroyed lives. Dario Marianelli's pulsating dramatic score also recognises this symbolism, employing the sounds of a typewriter to augment the events unfolding on screen.<br/><br/>The second act of the film is a lot more subdued than what had preceded it, and, despite numerous memorable scenes, fails to entirely satisfy. Unlike the first act, the war-time sequences seemed to be heading in no direction, wandering aimlessly towards an undefined goal. Perhaps this was deliberate {during this period, nobody's fate was certain}, but, without any narrative drive, the film failed to fully hold my attention. Now 18 years old, Briony (played by Romola Garai), has discarded a Cambridge education in order to become a nurse, perhaps her first attempt at atonement for what she did to Robbie. Meanwhile, Robbie, having enlisted in the British Expeditionary Force, is trying hopelessly to return home to his true love, the horrors of war closing in upon him at every turn. The centrepiece of this section is a breathtaking long-shot on the beaches of Dunkirk, as Robbie and his comrades observe the chaos and confusion of the British evacuation, certainly the most impressive shot of its kind since Alfonso Cuarón's 'Children of Men (2006).' Despite drawing too much attention to itself, and doing little to propel the plot, the planning and co-ordination that must have gone into this minutes-long tracking shot is worthy of the ticket price alone."

As an Ian McEwan fan I did expect a bit better, though I hadn't read Atonement before seeing it. I'm thinking this is not one of his better novels, but then again any sort of translation of stories that focus around characters and not plot is difficult. I suppose my disappointment was the plot was the winner over the characters. It has a nice twist at the end that saves it from being too formulaic. Kiera Knightly is superb. The beach scenes I was reminded by my friend are rather reminiscent of Titanic, as is the whole plot, and that's not a compliment I'm afraid.

"Hancock_the_Superb","7","0","2","13 January 2008"," Flawed, poorly paced but beautiful epic film
","In 1930's England, Briony Tallis (Saorise Ronen) is an aspiring writer and excitable young girl. She lives with her family on an idyllic British homestead, with her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and grounds-keeper Robbie (James McAvoy) tip-toeing around a fierce mutual attraction. But then a series of events between the two are seen and misinterpreted by Briony, which ultimately lead Briony to accuse Robbie of raping her friend, 15 year old Lola (Juno Temple). Several years later, World War II is raging, Robbie is stranded in France as the British army limps to Dunkirk, and Briony (Romola Garai) and Cecilia are estranged from one another, serving as nurses in different parts of the country. With Cecilia and Robbie determined to get together, Briony must figure out how to atone for her mistake before its consequences become irrevocable.<br/><br/>Joe Wright's adaptation of Ian McEwan's ""Atonement"" has the feel and look of a David Lean epic, not to mention ""The English Patient"". A tragic love story, well-drawn, flawed characters, a wartime setting, and a series of striking images are all present. Unfortunately, ""Atonement"" doesn't live up to the aforementioned films, and though entertaining, it contains a number of serious flaws.<br/><br/>The story and character of Briony are what make ""Atonement"" so interesting. As an impressionable, inexperience young girl, Briony finds herself living through an extremely traumatic day. He sees Robbie apparently forcing Cecilia to dive into a fountain, accidentally deliver a vulgar message, and ""raping"" her in the library, before coming across her friend being assaulted. As a thirteen year old, her reaction is understandable, and I don't entirely side with the anti-Briony faction of viewers. Unfortunately, she decides that her confused version is the gospel truth, leading to jail and military service for Robbie and Cecilia's estrangement from family. As she's older, will she be able to fix what she did wrong, or has Fate taken it out of her hands? The relationship between Robbie and Cecilia is sweet, but in terms of interest the deeply conflicted Briony is squarely in the foreground. She is a very well-drawn character, and its to the credit of both the writers and the three actresses playing Briony that she works so well, and even elicits a significant amount of sympathy.<br/><br/>The film has several serious flaws, the most of which is hard to describe in a review: pacing. Even though the film is only 130 minutes, it seems a lot longer, with many sections dragging on and on. For an epic film, maintaining interest for its length is essential, and poor pacing is perhaps the worst thing that can happen. For a two hour film to seem like three or more is a serious handicap. Some of the film's stylistic choices are a bit much, for instance showing Briony's seeing an event and then showing how it ""really"" happened, as well as some of the slow-motion, and ""re-wind"" scenes. Many flashback scenes are also done in a disconcerting manner that irritates rather than intrigues.<br/><br/>The film has striking cinematography by Seamus MacGarvey, capturing the beautiful English countryside and the horror of war-torn France. The celebrated tracking shot at Dunkirk is well-done, although not impressive in the strictest sense. But the movie has its fair share of striking images in quieter moments to compensate: Robbie watching a bomber plane through his skylight window, the French soldier with a fatal head wound, a group of executed school girls in a field (a scene which recalls the cadet scene in ""Doctor Zhivago""). On a purely visual level, the film is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>While I will not reveal it here, the film's climax came completely out of left field, and in a good way. It's one of the most tragic conclusions to a film ever, and the ending is the definition of bittersweet, in my opinion. It goes a long way towards redeeming many of the movie's flaws.<br/><br/>The acting is generally good. Briony is clearly the main character, and all three actresses - Saorise Ronen, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave - do a brilliant job with her complicated character. James McAvoy balances charm and bitterness as Robbie, and he is definitely on his way to becoming an A-list star. Keira Knightley is tolerable, but this film convinces me that she's just not a very good actress. The supporting cast is more or less non-descript.<br/><br/>""Atonement"" has the look and feel of a great epic, and succeeds in being intriguing through most of its length. Poor pacing and a few questionable style elements prevent this from being a truly great film, but that doesn't keep it from being enjoyable.<br/><br/>7/10"

You come to think a little about Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"", although this is quite another form of movie and another theme.<br/><br/>What brings it down is the rather conventional way the plot develops. It's like two different directors have made the first and the second half. But the first one is a great thriller in a way you haven't seen before. Well worth seeing."

","I thought it was a very good story with the sneaky ending but i told my girlfriend my heart basically fell asleep during the movie because of how boring it was.

I don't think so, any reaction???"
"Philby-3","9","0","1","6 January 2008"," A fine adaptation of a novel about guilt
","This is a very atmospheric adaptation of Ian McEwan's very moody and powerful novel, set in an upper-class English household of the 1930s and in the England of the early war years. There are various ways of atoning for deeds we regret, and in the book, writing becomes atonement. Briony Tallis, at 13 makes a mistake affecting two people close to her which haunts her for the rest of her long life. One of them is Robbie the son of the family's housekeeper, who has been given an Oxford education by the family, and the other is her older sister Cecilia who is in love with Robbie.<br/><br/>Briony, who probably has a pubescent crush on Robbie, falsely accuses Robbie of sexual assault on Lola, a visiting cousin, and as a result Robbie is sent to prison. Five years later, in London during the early part of the Second World War, Briony tries to atone for her wrong. It is not at all clear whether Briony acted maliciously, but she feels guilty about it (it has destroyed her relationship with her sister) and that is sufficient.<br/><br/>As the book gives alternative views of what has happened, the film makers have had to do the same, and have done so rather neatly, in a way which does not interrupt the narrative. This is easy in prose, but not so easy on film. They have also done a mini Spielberg re-creation of the evacuation of Dunkirk, which evokes the desperation of the event beautifully. Dunkirk was no triumph, merely a total disaster averted. The hospital scenes are grim testament to the losses the allies suffered. But this is a very personal story. Briony goes on to be a successful author, and it is only in the final scenes we find out how she has assuaged her sense of guilt. Here the film departs from the book, Briony (Venessa Redgrave) telling all in a TV interview rather than attending a birthday party put on for her by her family. The book somehow completes the cycle of Briony's life in a way the film does not.<br/><br/>There is some staggeringly good acting here by all the actors playing Briony, Saiorse Ronan (who was only 12 at the time), Romola Garai, and last but not least Vanessa Redgrave. James McAvoy as Robbie and Keira Knightly as Cecilia also put in good performances though Keira's voice coach should be sacked  she was allowed to speak far too fast. The large ugly mansion used as the Tallis house, Stokesay Court in Shropshire, leaped straight from the pages of the novel, and the love scenes between Robbie and Cecilia were both tasteful and erotic.<br/><br/>If we do have to have adaptations of highly literary works like this one, we can be thankful that here the spirit of the story is still present. I don't think McEwan writes with the screen in mind, though he wrote a brilliant screenplay for ""The Ploughman's Lunch"" 25 years ago. He (and we) are lucky that the film makers here had some idea as to what he was on about."
"Braddigan","7","0","1","4 January 2008"," Visually stunning but convoluted; not academy-award worthy, but worth a watch
","No rhymes, no embellishments, no adjectives... just kidding...<br/><br/>This film is a chick flick, which I insist is not a pejorative. That is not surprising, but it is one of the reasons I didn't adore this film. It is suffused with the kind of hopeless romanticism that I find, unfortunately, incredible. Some reasons why the kind of 'love' displayed is plausible in this case: the impending great war, the ww1 environment, human nature's tendency to translate desire into love. Still, it will always be a mystery why people rationalize, or should I say excuse, sex with love? It's not necessary, nor is it realistic. It is however a fixture of the dramatic, romantic chick flick. Apparently, people find it beautiful. Nicely portrayed in this film, but not necessarily appreciated.<br/><br/>Frankly, the most beautiful thing in this movie - no, not Keira Knightly's sprightly, elfin body - is its photography. The cinematography is excellent. Varied, unorthodox, meticulous, it is delightful and masterful. The scenes of war and Dunkirk are particularly haunting.<br/><br/>Additionally, the pacing and sequence of the film are stupendous... stupendous. They are inventive and interesting. Unfortunately, there is some amount of repetition, or should I say redundancy. The film could have been pared down. At 123 minutes, it is not excessively long, but for what was presented, it is a bit overdone and over-complicated. Additionally, it could have benefited from more characterization. The dialogue is smart and tight, but slightly sparse, especially for the minor characters.<br/><br/>The story, of course, is one we have heard before. It is cherished, and treated wonderfully in this presentation. Acting is very fine, though I will never really fall for the histrionics of the semi-human Knightly. All in all, a very nice and even slightly philosophical and provocative movie. Who would have thought a chick flick could be so ambitious?"
"tjsprik","6","0","1","3 January 2008"," A good movie but not great
","With all the rave reviews of Atonement, I was surprised to be only mildly impressed. After viewing the movie I re-read the comments of others, and it seems that those who read the book prior to seeing the film have the highest praise. For those who haven't read the book, like myself, the story became confusing at times.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie, which takes place in a beautiful English house, is definitely a perfect 10--the sets, the acting, the characters, etc.--all contribute to a sense of anticipation about what's to come.<br/><br/>Possible spoiler: After one of the main characters is falsely accused and taken to jail, the movie breaks down. The sets and acting continue to be amazing, but the story doesn't hold together. There is one scene which is so confusing and non-sensical (Ce, Robbi, and Briony in Ce's apartment) as to be distracting. This scene is later explained by an older version of Briony toward the very end of the movie, but to be honest, I was so distracted trying to figure out the scene that I couldn't get back into the story.<br/><br/>I suspect the book is amazing, because the concept of the story is brilliant--the actions we take can have devastating effects on others. But the limited character development early on prevents a viewer from feeling complete sympathy with them as they move through their lives and through the consequences of Briony's lie. For example, the relationship between Ce and Robbi is (spoiler) given to us as a sexual relationship with mere hints that it's more than that, yet the rest of the story requires us to believe they had a deep, deep love for each other. And we're never sure why Briony (spoiler) tells the lie that she does--what is her motivation? Was she jealous of her sister? Of Robbi? Better character development and less confusion would have made this movie a 10 in my opinion.<br/><br/>Read the book first and then you'll probably love it."

","Voltaire wrote that history is a pack of tricks that the living play upon the dead. The point of Atonement appears to be that history is a pack of tricks the living play upon themselves because it is more comforting that way. We are shown the newsreel story of Dunkirk as epic of British pluck and endurance, compared with a purportedly real account of Dunkirk as spectacular balls up. In parallel, we see Briony's fictional tidying up of the mess she has made compared with the actual unhappy and unresolvable consequences. Although she knows the truth, she is still trying to persuade herself that her fiction restored something irretrievably lost that it was beyond her power to restore in fact."

"alerter","7","0","4","8 December 2007"," I wanted to like this film a lot more
","The film's been compared with The English Patient; but it doesn't quite measure up. <br/><br/>The actresses who portray Briony all turn in fine performances. McAvoy delivers a most believable and harrowing portrayal of Robbie Turner. The consequences of his overwhelming betrayal by Briony Tallis. His gradual physical collapse during the British retreat at Dunkirk. McAvoy's eternally hopeful yet pragmatic Turner never surrenders, even as his flesh and blood are about to finally fail him. <br/><br/>Wright displays polished excellence in the unedited shot that he orchestrated to present the milieu of the beach at Dunkirk -- not only for the handling of the steadycam, but for composition over the course of the shot. Principal characters weave in and completely out, transporting the viewer directly into the midst of the confusion, suffering and hope. That scene is nothing less than brilliant. <br/><br/>No matter how many excellent piece parts there are in Joe Wright's film, the whole fails to exceed their sum. <br/><br/>The first third of the film is where I find fault. My suspension of disbelief was rudely broken, more than once, in there. <br/><br/>When a writer tells a story, the reader is forced to go by the words that are on the page. Even when the reader ""reads between the lines,"" the reader does so with the mind's eye, not with independent physical vision. <br/><br/>It works, on the page, whenever Briony's version of crucial events is presented in advance of Robbie's and Cee's experience of the same; because McEwan can quickly conjure up a full and satisfying enough description of outward appearances and inner states of mind. McEwan can take leaps and keep us exactly where he wants us to be as readers. <br/><br/>Film, however, is a medium of explicit vision and the viewer's eye can't help but wander far and gaze deeply. <br/><br/>When Wright shows us Briony's mildly distorted view of things, first, it undermines the story of the budding love between Robbie and Cee. It also steals momentum from the drama surrounding the three. The mild depiction of Briony's skewed ""view"" of crucial Robbie/Cee events deflates those events before they are fully savored by the audience, in as dissatisfying a manner as coitus interruptus. The sweetness of the romance is soured before the audience is permitted to taste it. <br/><br/>A thinking audience also has to ponder how a 13 year old girl, who writes pithy plays, who has formed so sharp an opinion about what the ""foulest word, ever"" must be, could then begin to so thoroughly ""misinterpret"" all that she comes to witness one hot summer day. The love scene in the library, as Briony saw it, has nothing whatsoever in common with the later rape scene (that is flashed once in real time and again as a vivid remembrance) that Briony later witnessed. Her accusation of Robbie is impossible to fathom as having even a single shred of innocence; it can only be chalked up to sinister motives. If I am to care much at all about Briony in the last third, I have to have one shred of sympathy for her by the conclusion of the first third. The film could have and needed to take more dramatic license. <br/><br/>These are mistakes that I did not expect Wright to make. Is this thudding clumsiness the handiwork of the same person who so ably directed the rest of the film? <br/><br/>What I ask for, could be accomplished almost entirely through a re-edit of the first third of the film. <br/><br/>I would rather that Wright present the Robbie/Cee thread of events, as they experienced them, before we take time to revisit them through Briony's eyes. Permit the audience to make an emotional investment in the small and intimate; allow us to root for the couple's success. Only then bring Briony's mild misinterpretations into play. Create narrative and emotional momentum before you break it. Spring Briony's betrayals of Robbie on us in a more fully formed context. (Briony betrayed Robbie at least twice. Intruding on the ""wrong note,"" intended for Cee, was the mouse trap. Accusing Robbie of raping Lola was the bear trap. Considerable dramatic momentum was lost between these two story beats, because of a failure to more boldly reinterpret the setup, in the first part of the book, for the visual medium of film.) <br/><br/>Otherwise, one way to make Briony's misinterpretations more effective as the first representation of critical events in the film, would be for Wright to present them as being much more ""over imagined,"" far more grotesque than and out-of-whack with a more balanced and informed view of the same. The Robbie/Cee thread would still be sorely under served, but the problem of Briony's state of mind might begin to act as a more adequate dramatic point of focus. <br/><br/>The dramatic failures of the first third, also weakens the poignance of the final third. <br/><br/>A much older Briony remembers past events with clarity, depth and more objectivity. But then she spins a fictional final chapter to her story of Robbie/Cee, in her final work as a celebrated author. She thinks it an atonement, when atonement is no longer possible. Briony's book becomes an empty act of selfish commerce, not anything noble, despite what she confesses to be the truth and her motives during the taping of the interview (featuring English Patient director Anthony Minghella as Briony's interviewer). <br/><br/>Briony's imagination simply continues to overpower her. She is still out of synch with reality, even at that late stage of her life.<br/><br/>... <br/><br/>These nits of mine might not matter much to others. I still hope people will go to see this film. <br/><br/>I hope that more people will also be moved enough to read McEwan's book, if they haven't already."

James McAvoy was good but I still think he should have been nominated for The Last King of Scotland. This role did not seem to stretch him as much. I am betting Keira will get an Oscar nod. The movie itself is sad but well reflected. A few funny parts in it. It brings a lot of emotions to the screen. Shame, anger, regret. The war part was a bit long to me.

"jdesando","Null","0","2","7 December 2007"," Strange Estrangement
","""Then is there mirth in heaven,/ When earthly things made even/ Atone together."" Shakespeare's As You Like it.<br/><br/>It's a comfort to know that a first-rate novelist appreciates the consequences of a lie: Ian McEwan's Atonement, unimpressively adapted for film, is a testimony to the power of Nemesis, who lamely applies comeuppance to the worthy, such as adolescent Briony (Saoirse Ronan), who suffers a major case of remorse after wrongly accusing Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) of raping Lola Quincy (Juno Temple). Briony has a crush on Robbie, and after recognizing the considerable competition of the older Cecelia Tallis (Kiera Knightly), resorts to a lie that sends Robbie to prison and then WWII and the rest of the characters into various stages of suffering.<br/><br/>McEwan's allegory, when applied to the machinations of Hitler and ineffectuality of the early allies, is satisfactory for also showing the hope underlying most grand human enterprises. The horrors of WWII as experienced by the condemned Robbie, taking an option to become a foot soldier, are more profound, of course, than the injustice of his spending years in jail. In lengthy tracking through a battlefield that occupies a sagging center of the film, the homely tensions of an uptight Brit family unfortunately give way to director Joe Wright's epic pretensions and thereby lose the drama essential to McEwan's vision of Briony's personal transmogrification and return to humility. Briony, however, lives her own hell as age brings maturity and a growing sense of what she has done wrong to affect the lives of so many by her lies.<br/><br/>But she becomes a writer with 21 books to her credit, the final one called Atonement, an autobiography that expiates as it exposes her sin, played by Vanessa Redgrave, perfectly displaying Briony's weary acceptance of her guilt and still strange estrangement from deep feelings. One problem is that she's still a writer who can't restrain herself from writing fiction, which she does with this story as well, allowing McEwan and company to comment on the lies inherent in fiction and autobiography. Necessary lies? Maybe.<br/><br/>Although the results might prove otherwise, the truths that emanate from lies may be more worthy than first thought, atonement a blessed state reached with a battlefield of victims more vicious than a carefully carefully-crafted but hollow world war landscape."
