"Faery","Null","188","250","27 December 1998"," Shakespeare would be proud
","I went to see this movie not knowing what to expect. On the one hand, I was excited, because you see, I am an English major and here was this movie based on the life of William Shakespeare. In the realm of Shakespeare rip-offs (i.e., ""Romeo & Juliet,"" ""Macbeth,"" etc..)""Shakespeare in Love"" clearly stood out. This is the first film I've seen based on the author, rather than his work. And it was a refreshing change from watching the pompous over-fed Hollywood egoes trying to pass themselves off as true actors. At the same time, however, the casting had me a bit nervous. I had not seen Joseph Fiennes work, but I had high hopes since his brother is, in my opinion, a brilliant actor. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Emma"" and ""Sliding Doors,"" but I was wary to see how she would pull this one off. And as for Ben Affleck.. well, I was truly afraid he would flop. I saw him in ""Armageddon"" and immediately racked him up on the list of other such forgettable actors as .. well never mind. The point is, I was afraid he would make a laughing-stock of this movie. As for the other actors,I did not recognize any one else except Judi Dench, and I figured hers was a bit role, nothing that could affect this movie much. I was wrong on almost all counts. Gwyneth Paltrow was so radiant in this movie, she fairly set the screen ablaze. I never knew she had such range. I had not expected such fire in her, I always thought she was a rather calm actress, incapable of such passions. Joseph Fiennes amazed me far more than his brother in that he knows how to balance wit and passion, joy and sorrow gracefully, even more so than Ralph. Together, these two actors did more than carry off the film; they raised it up to levels higher than any other actors I've seen in a very long time.  Judi Dench may have had a bit role, but she managed to make a lot out of it. She played Queen Elizabeth with more majesty and grace than any other Queen-playing actress I've seen. (I've yet to see Cate Blansett in the movie ""Elizabeth."")But the true darkhorse of this movie is Ben Affleck. My God, he has a sense of humor! I never imagined. ""Armageddon"" didn't give him much space to roam in, but in this film he was all over the place. Had he not been flanked by such worthy thespians, he just might have stolen the show. The actors could not have done such marvelous work had it not been, of course, for the writing. The play flows smoothly, with nary a glitch in sight. This is note-worthy, for it is well over 100 minutes. It is written in a style that is at once clever and grave, passionate and dry. Love is one of the most abused notions on the screen today. It is rare to see a movie portray Love with as much originality and truth as this film has accomplished. Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay this movie I already did on Christmas night, when I went to go see this film. As the movie ended and the actors' names scrolled up on the screen, tears trickled down my cheeks. I must say it is not often a movie makes me cry. And don't underestimate me just because I am a girl and because I may be more sensitive because you see, my boyfriend left the theater with suspiciously bright eyes as well.."

","Shakespeare in Love, the best picture winner of 1998, I know this film receives a lot of bashing due to that win. I believe that also Saving Private Ryan was nominated, which it was also an incredible film. To be honest, I couldn't pick between the two, because both were wonderful films and completely different genres. But anyways, back onto Shakespeare in Love. Everything about this film was perfect and I think that's why it received so many Oscar nods and wins, I mean, the costumes, the acting, the sets, the story was absolutely terrific and wonderful to watch. John Madden knew what he was doing and shot this film so beautifully. The cast also seemed to really enjoy doing this film and worked so well together. Gwyneth Paltrow won best actress for this film and she did a terrific job portraying Viola, she was so elegant and touching. The love story between her and William Shakespeare is truly a memorable one.<br/><br/>Viola is a first class lady who is about to be married to Lord Wessex, a man who she does not love. Her heart belongs to poetry, mainly the poetry of William Shakespeare. William has lost all hope though when his heart is broken by his girlfriend and he is writing a comedy called Romeo and Ethyl, the pirate's daughter. Since the plays are only played by an all male cast, Viola dresses up as a man and auditions for his new play. She receives the part of Romeo; later that night at a big party her father is throwing, she meets Shakespeare and it is love at first sight. When William finds out the truth that she is the boy who loves his poetry, he doesn't care, they have a passionate affair and continue on with the play as if she were a boy. But the plot thickens and Viola knows that she must go back to her life of an unwanted love and marriage.<br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love is without a doubt a fine film and should have a higher rating in my book. I don't understand why so many people hate this film, I thought it was extremely clever and witty. It had a beautiful love story, it was funny, it was sad; there's nothing wrong with this film, but hey, everyone's a critic, right? I highly recommend Shakespeare in Love, just trust me, if you enjoy Shakespeare and his poetry, I'm sure you'll love this film. Just give it a chance, who cares about the Oscars? They make mistakes at times, but Shakespeare in Love is a great movie and I enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"vspa87","Null","95","133","29 December 1998"," An excellent film in all aspects.
","I had high hopes for this film from the first time I saw the trailer. I am happy to say that the film lives up to the previews. Although it is an art house flick of sorts, it manages to be profound and accessible at the same time. So many art house films manage to be merely pretentious, as if aimed at those that want to believe that they are having an intellectual experience rather than those who are really open to one. This film shows that you can make a film of substance that is at the same time very entertaining.<br/><br/>One thing that stood out was the way they showed enough of the performance of Romeo and Juliet so that you could understand what the play is about, without making it a film of the play per se. There are many parallels between the fictional play and the events of the film, and this goes to underscore the relevance of great literature to the human condition. The actual performance of the play was acted so well that there were times when a character in the play was in a fight and I said to myself ""they're really fighting, that guy really got stabbed!"" So often a play within a movie is acted in a very staged manner, so this was a welcome surprise. And for anyone who is a fan of Shakespeare, it is easy to find little tidbits to reflect upon - such as the fact that Shakespeare himself was fond of the ""play within a play"" theme that we see in this film.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent throughout, including minor characters. In the midst of tragedy there is genuine comic relief, just as in Shakespeare. The historical details that surround the conjectural main plot are accurate down to the names of the actual people with whom Shakespeare crossed paths. In the end ""Shakespeare in Love"" causes us to feel as well as think, to think as well as to be entertained."

","Those who are looking for a historically accurate portrayal of Shakespeare's life had better look elsewhere - but then this was never intended to be a serious look at the life of the man.  Those who attack it for its' fanciful relation to history have missed the point entirely.  It is a romantic comedy obsessed with nothing more than making references in storyline and plot to the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and those references are made so seamlessly it could almost be assumed that what we see on the screen actually happened to the man.<br/><br/>In fact the overall story we are presented with is not new.  Anyone who had read or seen `Romeo and Juliet' will have a pretty shrewd idea of the path the narrative takes - the twist is that in the film, Shakespeare writes the play `Romeo and Juliet' in parallel to, and based on, his `real life' relationship with Lady Viola.<br/><br/>The opening sees Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) desperately trying to write the masterpiece `Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter', a comedy he hopes will rival anything by Christopher Marlow (Rupert Everett).  Words fail him until his muse appears in the shape of Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a noblewoman whose love for the work of Shakespeare's leads her to dress as a boy (since at the time women were not allowed on stage) and attend an audition in disguise (mistaken identity and women dressing as men are devices Shakespeare often used in his comedies).  She is given the role of Romeo and begins a forbidden relationship with Shakespeare, the only one who knows her real identity, in spite of the fact that she is betrothed to the villainous Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) at Queen Elizabeth's (Judi Dench) command.<br/><br/>Fiennes portrays Shakespeare wonderfully and not as the infallible master of rhetoric.  He takes the Bard from the pedestal and brings him down to a human level that we can all sympathise with.  His relationship with Paltrow is handled sensitively, although many of the scenes that are exclusively their own did have enough a little too much `Chick-Flick' for my liking. Paltrow's R.P. accent is technically very good, and though I normally like my English to be played by the English, I was as happily surprised by her performance as I was by Ben Affleck's brief, but memorable portrayal of the self-important Ned Alleyn.  Much of the credit, though, must go to Michelle Guish for the wonderful supporting cast including:  Judi Dench, Simon Callow, Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter, Martin Clunes and Geoffrey Rush, to name but a few.<br/><br/>John Madden directs hypnotically and constantly keeps the camera on the move but most credit for the film must go to Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard for their cunning and often self-parodying script.  The only comment I would make is regarding the sheer number of theatre references.  Those who have worked in the theatre will be aware of many, if not all, of the in-jokes that the film is littered with.  Those who have not may be left with the feeling that they have been excluded from much of the content."
"BB-15","Null","58","87","20 June 1999"," An Abundance of Riches
","A romantic comedy does not get much better than Shakespeare in Love. Here is a movie that captures the feel of England 400 years ago. It is romantic yet light. It is funny but is complex enough to provide enjoyment for fans of literature.<br/><br/>The sets of England 400 years ago, the costumes and the character's makeup including their bad dental work were just right. You could almost smell those streets. The hero, Shakespeare, is excellently played by Joseph Fiennes. He is sympathetic but never pathetic. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, she shows her range from boyishness to radiance. This is the first film I have seen her in where I believed she could become a great actress. There is also a great supporting cast, especially Judi Dench, who all have good melodramatic and comic instincts.<br/><br/>The film never plods. The screenplay is rich with romance, emotion and action.  The plot weaves several stories and themes. You can enjoy it as a simple love story with some action and basic suspense about producing a play or you can get much deeper into movie's complex tapestry of ideas and in jokes. But most importantly the film's mood is always light and is never overblown (unlike another recent movie about unfulfilled love, Great Expectations).<br/><br/>Deserving of its Oscar, this is simply a great film."
"pooch-8","Null","44","67","13 January 1999"," Impressive spin on Shakespeare, with a contemporary feel
","Tom Stoppard, who penned Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, knows a thing or two about the modern deconstruction and reconstruction of Shakespeare's work -- and it shows in the bright and vivid Shakespeare in Love, which Stoppard co-wrote with Marc Norman.  Applying many of the same conventions favored by Shakespeare in his own work (including primarily the confusion over mistaken identity and gender) the screenwriters begin with the ""what if"" premise and run with it, speculating with wicked delight on the Bard's rivalry with Christopher Marlowe, his use of overheard phrases finding their way into his plays, and best of all, the possible sources of his inspiration.  Will's muse is Violet, played wonderfully by Gwyneth Paltrow, who shows off in this film her finest acting to date and credibly pulls off the tricky task of being both an object of poetic inspiration and a genuine, down-to-earth human being."
"yuckbug","10","90","149","13 December 1998"," A Terrific Film
","I saw a preview of this movie and it was terrific.  Most period movies are long, boring, usually low-concept and often as emotionally heavy as the costumes in which the actors trudge around (Elizabeth, Wings of the Dove, The Piano, Restoration, etc...)<br/><br/>Well this movie was different.  Don't be afraid of the word Shakespeare in the title!  This movie is not a junior-high history lesson.  It's light, funny, romantic, and a totally irreverent look at Elizabethan England.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant.  The best writing in a movie I've seen this year.  The idea is that Shakespeare is not some grave, great poet, but a young guy trying to make his way in the theatre.  He's written good plays, but nothing truly transcendent.  The conceit is that an ill-fated romance--the one great true love of this life--with a beautiful, smart woman is what inspires him to write his first immortal play: Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>In this era of world-exploding actioners and cookie-cutter Adam Sandler movies, it's rare to see such a specific, ingenious, and inspired story for a film.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is its sense of humor.  It plays with history, takes a great man abut whom we know alomost nothing, and creates a fantasy about his life that is totally outrageous, funny and real.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is really romantic.  The costumes are lush, the leads look great and have real chemistry together.  I used to think that Gwyneth was overrated, but here she's radiant.  And Joe Fiennes has an intensity and a vulnerabiliy, as well as a sense of humor, that I for one find sorely lacking in his older brother Ralph.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this is the best date movie of the year.  Women take note: I am a red-blooded straight American male, and I loved it.  Take your boyfriends to see this movie.  It will make up for you forcing them to sit through The Piano."

Complete with balcony scenes, the great Judy Dench as Queen Elizabeth and a myriad host of todays brightest actors. The script is fun & lively, well acted & moves along in good measure. It is comical, heart warming and good clean fun. I watch it frequently."

","It's hard not to enjoy Shakespeare in Love.  It's witty, clever and beautifully shot.  The performances - except for Gwyneth Paltrow, who should definitely stick to the present tense - are solid (though not Oscar-worthy, as one has to applaud Judi Dench for admitting.)<br/><br/>But that's just about all there is to this pleasant piece of fluff.  It lacks any real substance, and for all the nods to Shakespeare and the smoldering stares, is basically your average, contrived love story. It has none of the depth that made The Truman Show and Elizabeth so outstanding.<br/><br/>An enjoyable, cute, picture?  Certainly.  The best of the year? Definitely not."

","When my English teacher told the class that we would be watching ""Shakespeare in Love"" everyone groaned, me included. We all thought it would be another boring movie, but I along with many others was pleasantly surprised. Even though the movie didn't portray the actual life of William Shakespeare, it is a very interesting interpretation of what his life might have been like. Normally I am not a big fan of Gwenyth Paltrow, but she fulfilled the role of Viola De Lesseps very well. This movie, unlike many others I have been forced to watch in school, has not been a waste of time and has informed us more about the concepts and details that could not be seen just by reading the play. Overall I think I have gained a better understanding of Romeo and Juliet by watching ""Shakespeare in Love""."
"petra_ste","7","10","13","27 August 2007"," A stolen season
","London, 16th century: young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) faces a bad case of writer's block, not making any progress in the comedy commissioned by Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) and his associate Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson). The work's title? ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"". Enters Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), beautiful lady with a passion for theater, who, disguised as a man, gets the role of Romeo. Will falls for her and their affair ends up shaping the final version of ""Romeo and Juliet"".<br/><br/>The two leads have a nice chemistry. Paltrow is delightful as Viola; Fiennes is likable as Shakespeare without losing the character's edge. But I enjoy the performances by Wilkinson, Rush and Dench (who is great as Queen Elizabeth) even more.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie features a group of colourful secondary characters played by an interesting cast, including also Imelda Staunton as Viola's nurse, Colin Firth as Viola's boorish suitor, Ben Affleck as a famous thespian and Rupert Everett as playwright Christopher Marlowe.<br/><br/>Frankly, I don't believe Shakespeare in Love deserved its stunning success at the Academy Awards. It had too many great competitors for Best Picture in 1998, including a genuine masterpiece like The Thin Red Line. As for Best Writing, it prevailed over The Truman Show, another modern classic and personal favourite.<br/><br/>Still, I bear this movie no ill will. It's a charming little thing.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ironhorse_iv","8","6","7","17 May 2017"," No matter, what some modern critics has to say. I still love Shakespeare in Love. A rose by any other name would continue to smell as sweet.
","It's sad, that this movie's reputation has suffered somewhat since its initial reception, largely because the Oscars foolishly choose this fantasy period rom-com over the realistic, grittiest, war torn themes of 'Saving Private Ryan' for the 1998 Best Picture Category. While, personally, I thought director Steve Spielberg's film 'Saving Private Ryan' was indeed the better film, I do have to say, the tale of a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) battling writer's block, until he meets his muse, an aristocrat's daughter enamored with theater and romance, Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), inspiring him to write one of his most famous plays, isn't that bad as some modern critics make it out to be. Without spoiling the movie directed by John Madden, too much, I have to say, 'Shakespeare in Love', is indeed delightful, romantic, and funny, especially for those whom field is in entertainment. I can see why, this movie would appeal to many audiences members. After all, William Shakespeare's is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. Everybody knows his work, however, nobody really knows, about his personal life. While, it's safe to say, that this movie version of his life is highly fictional, due to the case that Shakespeare's greatest work 'Romeo & Juliet' was actually inspired by a pre-existing stories, written by others writers, like Arthur Brooke in 1562 as the Italian verse called 'The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet' and retold in prose in 'Palace of Pleasure 'by William Painter in 1567, in which, Shakespeare only adapted to play. Still, I do like that, the movie, somewhat entertain us, by humorous cleverly inserting, words, events and imagery, on how Shakespeare might have gotta some of his ideas for his poets and plays. Who knows, maybe, some of the things, that playwright, Tom Stoppard & screenwriter, Marc Norman could had happen! After all, many of the background details in the film, minus the whole new world subplot & jokes of the modern studio system thing are pretty accurate. Plus, Shakespeare indeed expanded the original plot by developing a number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. However, the idea of that Shakespeare was in love with a woman, when writing it, might be question. Many of people believe that the play was honestly, written for a man, due to its many 'Homoeroticism' tones between Mercutio and its title character. Regardless, there is also the controversy about if William Shakespeare was indeed the writer of this play and others, as many believe that he wasn't. While, it's true, that Shakespeare never wrote a play for theater manager, Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) as no payments to the writer are listed in Henslowe's surviving account books, I really doubt, anybody else, wrote this play, especially, fellow playwright, Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett), as Marlowe's characters development tend to be very dry and two dimensional. William Shakespeare's writing really did stood out, compare to the others playwrights at the time, for example, his themes about fate & dreams were rarely used at the time. Even the topic of romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy, until 'Romeo & Juliet' came out. Although the play is not considered as great as some of Shakespeare's later work, at the time, it is an exceptional work for the young playwright destined for much bigger things. Regardless of the lack of historic accurate in the film, the film does show that William Shakespeare is destined for greatest. However, the film's plot did bug me on how alleged similarity, it is, to mid-20th-century novel, 'No Bed for Bacon' by Caryl Brahms and S J Simon. While, I wouldn't say, this film is a total rip-off of that novel, as the bulk of the book focuses instead on a handful of several other historical characters of the period like Sir Walter Raleigh's doomed search for fashionable cloak, while worry about the nobles, tasting their first potato. I do see, some similarities in this film, when it comes to characters, like Viola falling for a stressed-out Shakespeare, while dressing up as a boy in his stage play. This book has more to claims, then, author Faye Kellerman had on the film stealing from her 1989 novel 'The Quality of Mercy', which hardly seem alike. Regardless of similarities, I do have to say, the film does stand out on its own. Most of all of the cast (led by Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck, and Judi Dench) were at the top of their game. However, I couldn't call, Gwyneth Paltrow's acting as Oscar worthy. She was just alright with her near-flawless English accent. Nevertheless, I did think that Dame Judi Dench deserve her Oscar win, as Queen Elizabeth 1, even if her screen time was less than 10 minutes, out of 123 minutes film. On the other hand, I did believe that Geoffrey Rush got snub, out of his best supporting actor award. He was wonderful as Phillip Henslowe. I also believe the costumes and sets really stood out as Elizabethan Era design. It was wonderful to look at. I also believe the film score by composer, Stephen Warbeck was easy in the ears. It was charm to listen to. Overall: While, some people might hate the film for its tales of a Hollywood romantic fantasy torture artist finding love, without any meaningful sense of merit. Other will find it, as a blessed relief from gritty real-life true art is angst type of films. I just hope 'Shakespeare in Love' would get more the other half. It needs more love and appreciative. In the end, it kinda deserves that. It was indeed a good movie."

Possibly the most trite, predictable script to come out of the Hollywood cookie-cutter this year, and Hollywood once again displays its vapidity and lauds it. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Maybe even worse than the Best Picture travesty, was the Best Actress Oscar for Gwyneth Paltrow. I didn't think that the criteria for Best Actress was smiling demurely and showing off your breasts a lot. Sadly enough, that's what it appears to have become. Cate Blanchett deserved the Oscar so much more, as least to anyone to half a brain. However, you don't see her chest in the movie, so no Oscar. Disgusting.<br/><br/>Tom Stoppard must have had a serious off day when he wrote this. I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"". I only hope that it was a joke, or maybe he lost a bet. Depressing.<br/><br/>Worst movie of the year? Maybe not, but definitely a contender, and by far the most overrated movie of the decade."

","In the movie Shakespeare in Love, a  young and promising William Shakespeare is finding it difficult to write a new play.  He feels he has lost his gift for stringing together eloquent sentences and yearns for some sort of inspiration to rid him of his horrible writer's block.  William then meets the lovely and royal Viola, who is craving to be an actress.  She becomes his muse, as well as the lead `actor' in his new play Romeo and Juliet, as they weave a tangled love affair.  This burning passion they feel can only end with separation when Viola is forced to marry Lord Wessex and move to America.  This film is a wonderful combination of romance, comedy, and drama that attempts a new perspective of the classic Romeo and Juliet story.  It employs clever dialogue, beautiful scenes, and wonderful characterization to entertain the viewer. The film's Renaissance dialogue is true to its time period.  With such an excellent script, William comes across as the master of speech that he really is.  Some parts of the movie are purely funny as almost to parody the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet. Other parts intertwine the actual lines from the play, such as the multiple bedroom scenes between Will and Viola, to provide a unique and obvious parallel between it and the movie.  When Will quotes `Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' to Viola, this provides not only a sentimental scene but actual words from Shakespeare to add to the historical content of this film.   This film has an interesting twist on the tragic tale because Will becomes not just a writer pouring out the lines for pay, but a man pouring out his heart in true love.  At the end of the movie, Romeo and Juliet is presented as though you were actually sitting on the dirt floor of the playhouse.  You see the play through the eyes of a person in England during the late 1500's, except by this time the lead is not longer Romeo and Juliet but literarily and symbolically Will and Viola. The setting of this film is very well done, and the playhouses, taverns, and elegant houses convey the feeling of Renaissance England.  The costumes, including Queen Elizabeth's glamorous dresses and Viola's body-shaping corset,  are seemingly accurate.  (I would have hated wearing those clothes!)  The scenes between Will and Viola are rarely anything but love scenes, and they, like their counterpart scenes in Romeo and Juliet, mostly happen at night.  This adds to the mystery and forbidden feeling of the movie.  The characterization of this film was splendidly carried out.  I could not help but fall in love with the beautiful emotion that gushed from Will and Viola ( Will is extremely good looking by the way).  When the couple was separated in the end, I felt like a terrible wrong had been committed.  The character of Queen Elizabeth, with her snide comments and all-knowing attitude, was a comical representation of a serious position that kept me completely entertained.  Christopher Marlowe also provides a wonderful character that conveys `real person' qualities of competition between two famous playwrights. I found this film to be completely engaging from start to finish, but I would not recommend it to everyone.  I believe it could truly be given the title of `chick flick' by some viewers despite its fight scenes and comedic devices.  The viewer will gain a knowledge of the Renaissance period and its characteristics while also getting the feeling of knowing the great William Shakespeare, however inaccurate the description of Will may be.  I feel that now I appreciate the play Romeo and Juliet with a new sense of understanding that can only come from looking at an old tale in a new light."

","I love this film. It is cleverly written to include characters and events that we've read about in boring theatre history books for eons, but are now presented as living, lusty, real people. It gives us comic, romantic, sad, and hopeful moments all at the same time. The performances by all of the actors are top notch. Geoffrey Rush, Ralph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Ben Affleck are superb. The supporting cast is equally excellent. Not to be missed is the performance by Judie Dench as Queen Elizabeth l. Her time on film is short, but her impact on the film is enormous. Bits and pieces of Shakespeare's work are evident throughout, and the tie ins to Christopher Marlowe are inspired! Costumes, makeup, scenery, lighting, and sound - all the technical and design elements are incredibly well researched and well executed. This film gives us a wonderful look at life in the Elizabethan period, not just the life of those involved in the theatre. From the ink stained hands of Shakespeare to the contents of countless toss pots hurled out of upper floor windows, we feel the grime and grit endured by Londoners during the 16th century."

","We all know the Oscars are simply about Hollywood patting themselves on the back, and nowhere is this more evident with the 13 nominations received by 혩Shakespeare in Love.' Very little originality, horrible casting for a lead part and a well-planned ruse to pass this studio pic as an art film are simply some of the factors against this movie.<br/><br/>The story (if we can call it that) is no more than a simple collection of lines from the Bard's plays, blended together into a weak two-hour script. Adding pieces of Shakespeare's life into the mix, they pretend to explain the origin of famous lines and stories surrounding him, such as Shakespeare's relationship with Thomas Kent, who in truth was a man (it was widely accepted that William Shakespeare was bisexual). While the movie has no basis in reality, even as a work of fiction it fails miserably.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow gives an unimpressing and incredibly boring performance, looking like a Cate Blanchet wannabe, pretending to sound like Emma Thompson or Kate Winslet in her role as Viola, and like Kenneth Branagh when impersonating Thomas Kent. It's understandable, considering Thompson and Branagh have defined modern Shakespearean cinema, but her performance ends up being a weak attempt at emulating the masters of the genre. Every time she appears on-screen, she simply destroys the atmosphere of Elizabethan England (an atmosphere that is thin to begin with); she is simply out of place. So was Ben Affleck, but at least he didn't talk that much.<br/><br/>There are a few shinning stars in the pic, though. Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush give amazing performances given the weak script they had to work with, dashing the movie with a dose of comedy and great acting that carries the story at times, but not for 2 hours.<br/><br/>혩Shakespeare in Love' is okay as a mass-market date movie, a pic for those that have no idea what Shakespeare's plays are all about, a pic for the Teeny-Bopper crowd, but not as an Oscar Nominated Film. On the contrary, it is a perfect example why Hollywood should stick to doing Hollywood and leave the realm of art films for those with the correct vision to bring them to life. If it's Elizabethan cinema you are after, go see 혩Elizabeth' (you'll get great performances by Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush, too!). If it's a date movie you're after, see 혩She's All That;' at least it doesn't pretend to be what it is not."

The casting was awful (two unpleasant and barely talented leads in one film). Gwyneth Paltrow looking more like a duck than ever, giving her whole range of head movements. As for the plot, well, where can I start. Shakespeare has run out of ideas. He falls in love with a noble-woman (cue much mistaken identity, mistaken gender, in the style of Romeo and Juliet). Through the relationship with Viola (the tepid Paltrow) Shakespeare is inspired to write, yes, you guessed it, Romeo and Juliet. The problem with Shakespeare in Love is that you can see things coming a mile off, jokes, plot, references to historical figures. The only truly funny moments that I found were those in which members of The Fast Show (hilarious British comedy) were on screen. If you feel the need to go and see this film - take a moment and consider seeing one of Shakespeare's own plays which provide all the things that Shakespeare in Love fails to. And are a lot less hackneyed."

","Go get a cup of coffee, a beer, or a glass or wine. Go out for dinner, or stay home and dedicate to the ancient art of onan. Wash the car, do your taxes. Anything is better than going to see this incoherent drivel.<br/><br/>The film is just not funny. The idea of Shakespeare in a writing slump might have been good, but the forced insertion of the romance element is just concocted to extract some easy sighs from the viewer. How many of them were due to the movie, and how many to the thought of the $8 gone forever, I cannot say. The romance is as deja vu as it gets, the jokes are trite. The material would have been enough for a 20 minutes Monty Python sketch (with oh-so-more hilarious results), not for a full length feature film.<br/><br/>If you want to see a witty film of Shakesperean ambience, go rent the delicious Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, by Tom Stoppard.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes wears the same expression for the whole movie, and almost manages to make you think that Roger Moore was not so bad after all. Ben Affleck (Ben, how could you go from ""chasing amy to this?) acts as if he didn't really know where he is. Geoffrey Rush is confirming once more how Hollywood money can ruin a once brilliant actor."

","This is definitely not a film for all tastes.  ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a one joke comedy clearly aimed at self satisfied intellectuals of a literary bent.  In my opinion, it is neither terribly romantic nor terribly funny suffering as it does from sitcom style performances from its two leads; Joseph Finnes (looking very much like a Japanese animation character) and Gwyneth Paltrow (one of the most uninteresting actresses in Hollywood).<br/><br/>The one joke (a sophmoric conceit from Tom Stoppard) is to apply all the modern theater's cliche's (greedy theater producers, conceited actors, etc.) to Shakespeare's time.  The ""romance"" (Shakespeare finds his ""muse"" and the love of his life as he struggles to complete ""Romeo and Juliet"") is on a par with most paperback romance novels and consists mostly of Finnes and Paltrow gazing idiotically at one another.  The most satisfying moments are from the short excerpts from ""Romeo and Juliet"" but  Finnes and Paltrow play them so badly (and they are so poorly directed) that any real emotion is lost. One would be foolish to expect any accuracy in the recreation of Shakespeare's life and times (the authors of this triviality are far too self interested for that) but it is distressing to see Shakespeare reduced to a sitcom character in a second rate television show.  Pseudointellectual and neither charming nor funny, ""Shakespeare in Love"" was a total waste of my time."

","What inspired William Shakespeare to create his most famous work: Romeo and Juliet? Probably we'll never know with complete certainty. Through years, people have imagined what was the creative process behind it and one of the most intriguing ideas is what if Shakespeare had a muse that helped him to write the most famous and tragic love story ever told. Based on this premise, screenwriter Marc Norman and the acclaimed playwright Tom Stoppard play a little with historical facts to give us their own version of the story behind Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>London, 1593. Young Shakespeare is suffering a severe case of writer's block and he can't write anything. These are bad news for Phillip Henslowe, owner of The Rose (one of the most important playhouses of London at that time), who's in desperate need of a new play in order to pay his debts. In other part of the city, Lady Viola De Lesseps, daughter of a rich merchant is eager to be part of an acting company, even though women were not allowed to be on stage and let alone become actors. What they don't know is that destiny has a surprise for both of them: she will become his muse and will end up inspiring him to write again and he gives her a long-awaited opportunity by being part of the new play (although cheating a little since she has to dress herself as a man). But things won't be so easy for Viola, because she has been promised in marriage to Lord Wessex and she'll have to leave Will.<br/><br/>The screenplay offers us a completely different and fresh approach to Shakespeare and the Elizabethan period by choosing to explore a very risky field: the romantic comedy and the result could have been horrifying. Fortunately that never happens and instead we get a wonderfully charming and clever meditation about love as the greatest inspiration we'll ever find in life.<br/><br/>Also the acting is a pretty important element for the movie's success: all the actors deliver delightful performances, from Geoffrey Rush as Henslowe, Judi Dench (Oscar winner for this performance) as a complete scene-stealer Queen Elizabeth, Joseph Fiennes who gives Shakespeare a charisma that make people wonder if the real Shakespeare could have had and Gwyneth Paltrow, in her Oscar-winning performance as Viola, who assumes the risk of playing not one, but four characters and makes it in a wonderful way.<br/><br/>The production values, such as Sandy Powell's magnificent costume design, Stephen Warbeck's beautiful score also give the movie the necessary credibility and immerse the audience into a possibly not 100% historically accurate, but undeniably fantastic experience that makes us believe inspiration is possible to find."
"anika_trelenberg","8","7","11","1 February 2005"," Shakespeare in love
","The director John Madden has tried to link Shakespeare's life with the creation of his play ""Romeo and Juliet"". <br/><br/>Shakespeare, played by Joseph Fiennes, is a poor playwright who has lost his inspiration. While searching for a muse, he plans to write a comedy named ""Romeo and Ethel the pirate's daughter"". During the audition a young man catches Shakespeare's attention who is actually Lady Viola the Lesseps disguised as a man. She is fascinated by poetry and thus wants to be an actor. When Shakespeare calls upon her, she runs away. He finds out where she/he lives and asks for the young talent. At a dance he sneaks into the estate and meets Lady Violet. They fall in love with each other and she becomes his muse. Under her influence, he starts to write ""Romeo and Juliet"" and she plays the Romeo as Thomas Kent. The problem of the couple is that Shakespeare is married and that she is to be married to Lord Wessex who owns plantations in America. Eventually, Shakespeare finds out that Thomas Kent is Lady Violet. When the play is almost finished, the ""rat-boy"" sees that Thomas Kent is a woman and tells it the Guard. As women weren't allowed on the stage the theater is closed. Lady Violet has to marry Lord Wessex and on her wedding-day ""Romeo and Juliet"" is performed at concurrent's theater. She flees her husband to watch the play and has to play the Juliet. After the play Lord Wessex tells the audience that she is a women and wants to have everybody arrested but then Queen Elisabeth appears and as she is pleased by the play nobody is arrested at all. Now Lady Violet leaves for America but Shakespeare is still inspired by her. The movie got 7 Oscars and I think the actors' performance has earned that. Joseph Fiennes embodies a young and passionate Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow expresses Lady Violet's love for poetry very vivid and believable. Madden has succeeded to combine biographical facts about Shakespeare with a mainstream-suitable love story and one of the Bard's most famous plays. Even people who are not very interested in Shakespeare or his plays could like this film. It is a Hollywood-adaption of Shakespeare's life. Not very near to the facts but quite amusing."

","First, I'll admit to not being a fan of sheer fictional tales about famous historical figures, who aren't around to defend themselves. Poor Shakespeare may well be spinning in his grave. True, there's free speech, but just because he's the foremost bard of the English language does not give Hollywood the moral right to fabricate whatever drivel desired in order to entertain an audience and make a buck. Were the literary historians not outraged at the time? They should have been. It's difficult to believe this absurdity won an Academy Award for Best Picture.<br/><br/>This film concocts a purely fictional story wherein Shakespeare experiences writer's block while working on his new play 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter'. Meanwhile, the wealthy Viola, who's a fan of Shakespeare's plays and is engaged to marry the (quite predictably cold hearted) Lord Wessex, has always dreamed of becoming an actress herself. As acting is unacceptable in that era for a woman, she disguises herself as a boy to audition for the part of Romeo on stage. Thus begins a romance between the Bard and Viola, who is his inspiration for the immortal play we now know as Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>First of all, it's not exactly an original concept, the poor oppressed woman who's downtrodden because of her gender and not free to assume her desired profession, in this case acting. Rather an overworked theme. (I'm a woman, by the way). Gwyneth Paltrow is a lovely young actress, so it's nothing personal. Also, there are wonderful Oscar winning costumes. Really, however, this movie is basically a bedroom frolic about Will. I notice a few are claiming that a more appropriate title might be Shakespeare in Lust. <br/><br/>It really isn't right to concoct these fictitious tales, and for those who found it amusing & romantic...well, your entertainment was at the expense of an actual human being nearly four centuries deceased. He may or may not have appreciated it, but is not around to express his views. For those who claim that Shakespeare would be proud, I question these supernatural powers of discerning the attitudes of the long deceased. Instead of wasting time on this foolish movie, it might be better spent reading or viewing one of Shakespeare's plays on stage, or watching Franco Zeffirelli's beautiful 1968 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>My son (now a college freshman) was shown this silly Shakespeare in Love during an enriched high school English class a couple of years ago. He could never quite fathom what possible educational purpose this nonsense was intended to serve. Perhaps, as one reviewer suggested, the purpose of this film was to inform the modern world that Shakespeare had sex. Or if it's intended as an irreverent view of Elizabethan England, as some claim, we could well have managed without.<br/><br/>My favourite of all the comments read is that this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with Shakespeare other than to steal his good name. And sorry, I guess I'm just not one of those who can get much of a laugh out of the title 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirates's Daughter'. I find it quite a pathetic and juvenile attempt at humour, most definitely not Oscar caliber."

","Shakespeare in Love purports to be a comedy about Shakespeare suddenly inspired by a love interest (with Paltrow), and the words begin to flow like never before. Watching it, I found it far from funny. Everything that occurs in it is predictable and cliché, and not particularly endearing. It pokes fun at the clergy by having a clergyman protest against the theatre and its morality. Then, the screenwriters decide it will be great fun if the same clergyman reacts enthusiastically at a performance. It does not emerge as such. I'm quite surprised that Tom Stoppard, a fantastic playwright, has his name attached to this.<br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love starts promisingly: a hilarious presentation by a debtor to those he owes money to of an early storyline of Romeo and Juliet. Soon after, however, the constant references to Shakespeare's oeuvre become stiff and un-amusing. For instance, a clergyman yells ""a plague o' both their houses!"" referring to two rival theatres, which becomes a line in Romeo and Juliet. Not too bad? Well consider the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet being inspired by a similar encounter between Will and Gwyneth (alas, foiled by the Nurse, whose persistent calling for Juliet also makes it into the scene). Comic relief is soon provided in limited, spaced-out bursts (between the numerous sex scenes of course).<br/><br/>Perhaps my negative view of Shakespeare in Love is influenced by a vendetta I have against it. The film did not deserve 1999's Best Picture award, which should have gone to either Saving Private Ryan, Life is Beautiful, or The Thin Red Line. It practically swept the Oscars with 7 wins, which often it did not deserve. Gwyneth Paltrow won the Best Actress award. Apparently, perpetually flashing fleeting smiles and flaunting one's breasts (literally— her breasts are probably shown about 13 times) are Best Actress qualifications. Judi Dench won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress— for about 10 minutes of screen time, where she does what the Queen does best (i.e. save the day), but without making the performance particularly memorable or endearing.<br/><br/>And now for the redeeming qualities: Shakespeare in Love undoubtedly had some fine music. The music was purely opulent and made many of the scenes ""watch-able"". The film's strongest scene would have to be when someone (whose name I completely forget, but at the same time, couldn't care less) goes into the theatre where a rehearsal is taking place and a duel ensues with Shakespeare. Comically, musically, dramatically, and directorially, it is the film's most solid scene, and I briefly had hopes (which were mercilessly dashed) that the film might become good.<br/><br/>And now for some acting criticism: Joseph Fiennes is one of the most amateur actors I have ever had to endure watching— one of the poorest choices available for Shakespeare. Paltrow was bad enough where fleeting smiles were concerned— Fiennes makes her look like a genius. Ben Affleck plays well, an Elizabethan Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>The Verdict: A mediocre film at best, Shakespeare in Love was over-hyped, and definitely did not deserve all those Oscars it grabbed. Its Best Picture win is a direct slap in the face to two of the greatest masterpieces ever made (and The Thin Red Line, which should'vie won SOMETHING that year— it's a very good movie!). Cliché, stale, and uninteresting, I swear I thought my brains melted about 40 minutes into the movie. An agonizing experience for the most part. Geoffrey Rush is the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 2/10"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>This film surely hit a mass marketing sweet spot, I suppose because it was competently crafted, had a twee love affair, displayed some quaint costumes and gave the faint impression that in spite of its fun, it held something important. That last quality is the most important to me, especially when Shakespeare is involved, especially when the writer is Stoppard.<br/><br/>Some time back, Stoppard took two minor characters from Hamlet and recreated the play with most of the original themes and many of its metaphors. A key device was the self-referential play within the play. The whole thing (`Rosencrantz and Guildenstern') was brilliant and stands as one of the masterpieces of 20th century drama. Since then his light has mmed.<br/><br/>Here, he takes many of the same clothes and tries to drape them on `Romeo and Juliet' to emulate an ordinary date movie. There are some crafty touches in how the play within is bound to the play without, but they are mostly played as jokes. All the intelligence goes out of the concept because the core concept is broken: R&J is Shakespeare's most poetic work. It overflows with ideas - it overwhelms. Here, you have a double reduction: lace is turned to linen so far as the poetry so Hollywood doesn't turn off the masses; and the play is reduced to a love story, minus the drugs, charms, politics, fate, all the external machinery of the original. So one must completely discount the Shakespeare and Stoppard content and think of this film as a common thing.<br/><br/>But what possibilities they had! At the time this was set (about 1592-3) Shakespeare was duking it out with Marlowe, by far the better writer. Theaters were closed and they were in competition for Southampton's patronage. The poetry jam was stanzas of Marlowe's `Hero and Lysander,' versus Will's `Venus and Adonis.' Will, who has left an illiterate wife back in the country enters into first a homosexual relationship with Southampton, which then becomes a bisexual triangle with a `Dark Lady,' probably (married) occult siren Emelia Lanier. A way cool lady.<br/><br/>This was the time of Raleigh's famous `school of night' which studied the `black arts' and with which Marlowe was associated. (Will parodied it in `Loves' Labors' Lost.') The great scientist/magician Harriot led the school, mentor to Galileo and Kepler. He never published, indeed repeatedly destroyed his notes, because of recurring heresy trials. Similar trials resulted in Harriot's friend Bruno being burned by the Pope, Galileo coming close, and (likely) Marlowe being murdered, leaving the field open for Will. Southampton would later lose his head over this, driving Will deeper into the Catholic occult intrigue - all this recorded in the mysterious sonnets (and later referenced in `The Tempest').<br/><br/>Now there's some hot stuff! Wow  what Stoppard could have done! What comparative drivel we have instead."

In fact, one of the producers of the film has gone on record as saying how boring he found Shakespeare's plays as a student.

No, what I was trying to say was that, rather than a film of real intelligence, I found this to be a fairly unfunny, simple little film that's getting an undeserved reputation for intelligence, romance and wit.

"PBiddhi-1","Null","6","10","11 February 2002"," Review on `Shakespeare in Love' - 1998
","Summer 1953: William Shakespeare, well-known playwright, fails the words. In order to earn some money, Shakespeare promises the two competing theatre-owners of London his new script named `Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter'.  But, as I already mentioned it, he suffers from the so-called writer's block. This complicated situation makes him visit a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist's treatment turns out to be a waste of time and money.<br/><br/>
As his rival Marlowe gives him some tips for his new script, William feels humiliated. The playwright's inspiration returns, when Lady Viola, beautiful daughter of a prosperous gentleman, takes part in a casting for `Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter'. Dressed like a man, because women were not allowed to act on stage by order of Queen Elizabeth I, Lady Viola impresses Shakespeare so much, that he decides to follow her, as she escapes the theatre and flees from him. Later on, he invites himself to her father's dance in order to find the one, whose voice has turned his head. In the course of time, they come closer to each other and fall in love. Being in love, William dedicates several sonnets to her and gets back his gift to write.<br/><br/>The humorous love story of Shakespeare and Viola changes into a tragedy, just as his script of `Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter', renamed `Romeo and Julia', does. Viola's Father marries her to Lord Wessex, a nobleman who plans to buy land in Virginia to cultivate tobacco. Shakespeare, on the other hand, is married to Anne Hathaway.<br/><br/>As a result, the constellation turns the former love story into a tragedy, between William and Viola as well as between Romeo and Julia. Lady Viola has to leave with Lord Wessex.<br/><br/>The dialogues are easy to understand; still they contain the poetic language of the past. Joseph Fiennes, playing Shakespeare, does not personify a wise man, philosophizing all day in some backroom, not having any social contacts but a genius, whose life is most chaotic, exciting and driven by his passions. Gwyneth Paltrow, playing Lady Viola, does not correspond with prejudices people have towards the aristocracy. She is not stuck-up and spoilt. Lady Viola's most important desire for her future is to become an actress, a wish that was neither common nor allowed during the 16th century, especially as a member of the British upper class. She lets herself being carried away into adventures without having the feeling of leaving the throne.<br/><br/>Considering the throne, Queen Elizabeth I was its holder during Shakespeare's lifetime. Her strong influence on the theatre and in this respect the orders she enacted like the one which forbid women acting, are fantastically realized in `Shakespeare in Love'. Judi Dench expresses the Queen's power in an impressive way, especially by her mimic and movement. Slow but vigorous and sovereign, the Queen behaves and wherever she enters the room, people sag at their knees. For her brilliant acting, Judi Dench achieved the Oscar in the category `Best actress in a supporting role'.<br/><br/>The scenery of the film appears very authentic. Reading books about life in Britain during the 16th century, the directors and producers reproduced a quarter of London quite detailed. The streets are covered with dirt and citizens throw excrements out of their windows. The interior decorations are generally kept rather simple, wooden and robust. Torches light up the dark alleys of old London. `Shakespeare in Love' indicates the comeback of Shakespeare in our society. The opinion about his works as being outdated and incomprehensible has gone. The film, awarded with seven Oscars, has made a story of the 16th century become one of the present. Millions of people have seen the film and made it one of the most successful movies of the year 1998. The idea of making a movie about one of the most important playwrights in history is unprecedented and has revived a yellowed legend. Shakespeare is comprehensible again, for people who read his works just as for those who don't. The love story of the protagonists of `Shakespeare in Love', bound up with the love story of `Romeo and Julia' and its creation, arouse the viewer's interest even more. I most liked the last part of the film, the change between Viola and William, loving each other in a physical way on the one hand, and verbal on stage as Romeo and Julia on the other hand. The energy of love, the beauty of the poetic words are only disturbed by the ending, which is not what people would call a `happy' one. In spite of the romance and final tragedy, the acting is neither kitschy nor very exaggerated."

","Lots of people don't like John Madden's ""Shakespeare in Love,"" I think, mostly because it beat out Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the Best Picture Oscar.  But I'm not going to talk about that.  Why?  I'm not going to change anybody's mind, that much is obvious.<br/><br/>Well, if you want my opinion, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a superb motion picture.  It is, from every standpoint, a flawless piece of craftmanship. For starters, there is the acting, which is simply top-notch.  This is clearly Gwyneth Paltrow's breakthrough performance, in which she truly delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.  Her character is rich, vibrant, and wondrously alive.  As is Joseph Fiennes' take on Shakespeare.  Even though the Academy didn't see fit to honor him with even a nomination, that is not to say that his performance is bad by any means.  I predict that Fiennes will become a leading man in his own right, thanks to this film, because it is now completely obvious that he is an actor of great depth and enthusiasm, which is something Hollywood greatly needs today.  And who could forget Judi Dench?  The lady is, I think, simply brilliant.  Give her seven minutes of screen time and she turns out a virtual instruction manual on screen acting. Her take on Queen Elizabeth is witty, smart, daring, outrageous, and yet, deceptively simple, that is, all the things the Virgin Queen was herself. And, of course, there is also Ben Affleck and Geoffrey Rush, among others, whose work here sparkles with originality and vitality.<br/><br/>But lets get to the real core of what makes ""Shakespeare in Love"" a great film.  There is John Madden's effortless direction, and, above all, the amazing script by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.  Seriously, I can imagine people being left in the intellectual dust when they come face to face with this film, because it is what so many films aren't.  It manages to be blazingly intelligent, romantic, exciting, funny, serious, light, profound, historical, and farcical all at the same time, among other things.  The dialogue crackles with energy and originality, and the writers are clearly playing a sort of mental tennis match with the audience.  In the end, both sides win, and it is a glorious victory.<br/><br/>**** out of ****."
"andy-227","Null","13","27","1 March 2000"," Can you say ""overrated""?
","After ""Shakespeare in Love"" won almost every nomination, and beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture, I decided I had to see it.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and I had to wait for it to come to video.  After seeing nearly all of this year's Best Picture nominees, I felt more inclined to see it than ever.  I finally rented it on DVD, came home, popped it in, and expected a really great film.  As much to my shock as was my disappointment, it wasn't.<br/><br/>""Shakespeare in Love"" is not a bad film, and there are some things I liked about it.  It was a sumptuous period piece, and I admired Geoffrey Rush's performance, since he never ceases to amaze me with his acting talent. Gwyneth Paltrow was fair, although her performance didn't stun me.  However, the whole time I was watching this, my mind couldn't help but drift elsewhere, and I had to wake myself up in order to pay attention.  My point is, it simply didn't grab me.  Most of the Best Picture nominees and winners are films that grab my attention and have a strong influence on me.  This one didn't.  It was a cute love story, but not strong enough in my opinion to receive as much as a nomination.  It deserved awards for costume and set design, and Geoffrey Rush's performance, otherwise no.  This film was not one of the best films of 1998!  No way!  <br/><br/>Also, in the age of Columbine when theater owners are obsessive about carding children for getting into R-rated films, I can't see how this got an R-rating.  So what if we caught a glimpse of Gwyneth Paltrow's boobies. ""TITANIC"" let us see Kate Winslet in full view, and that got a mild PG-13. There is no explicit violence or sex in ""Shakespeare in Love"".  The MPAA's obsession with sex or nudity in any shape or form onscreen is uncanny. <br/><br/>
As for the overall quality of ""Shakespeare in Love"", it was well done.  I never said that it was a bad film, and I sort of liked it.  However, the fact that it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, proclaiming it as the best film of 1998, does nothing but disappoint and anger me."

","Well, it's been almost 20 years since this film won Best Picture, and I happened to catch it on TV. I was about 11 when this film came out, so I'd never seen it.<br/><br/>Now, having seen it, I have to say it's cute but that's about it. I don't see the huge appeal of it, aside from the costumes and Judi Dench being in the film for about 10 minutes. It's not a film that I'll remember, and certainly (IMO) not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar, especially over films made at the same time like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which is a film that I will always remember seeing because it made such an impression. This, sadly, did not make much of an impression and I can see why people say it didn't deserve the big prize.<br/><br/>I also don't get the Best Actress Oscar for Gwyneth Paltrow. Personally, I've always found her too pretentious to be appealing on screen, but I'll admit she is talented. As for Best Actress... nah. There are about 100 other actresses who could have played the role just as well, so I can't watch this and say, ""Oh wow, this is such a great part for her. What a performance!"" Neither her nor the film are memorable, and I'd imagine she was given the award more so for being popular at the time, and not based on the strength of her actual performance. <br/><br/>I've seen ""Elizabeth"" which was released the same year, and I think the very talented Cate Blanchett deserved the Oscar so much more than Paltrow. Then again, Blanchett has won two Oscars since this film and Paltrow's career declined not long after her win, so obviously we don't need to really debate who the better actor is. <br/><br/>I'd say watch this film, and then decide for yourself what should have won the Oscar. Then watch ""Saving Private Ryan"" and see which you remember."

","Every so often a movie comes along that is literate, intelligent, and has magic and charm to spare. Movies like these affirm our belief that film is a terrific art form. Shakespeare In Love is one such movie.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles Shakespeare's writer's block while trying to write a play entitled Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. In desperate need of a muse, Shakespeare finds one in the beautiful noblewoman Viola de Lesseps who has a desire to be an actor at a time when women are forbidden from performing. Shakespeare and Viola fall in love thus inspiring Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>As Shakespeare, Joseph Fiennes steps out of his brother Ralph's shadow and proves what a dashing and charismatic leading man he can be. Fiennes has a Peter O'Toole quality about him and should become a big star. While his portrayal may be nothing like Shakespeare, he makes us believe in romance Shakespeare's woes.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning as Viola de Lesseps. She throws herself into the part and handles an English accent very well as she did in Sliding Doors and Emma. Viola is the heart and soul of the movie, she is the reason for Romeo and Juliet's existence and Paltrow truly makes us believe in romance.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is all terrific. Geoffrey Rush is amusing as the theater owner Henslowe. Ben Affleck is truly surprising a hammy actor, with good material, Affleck is quite a capable actor. Judi Dench and Queen Elizabeth and Rupert Everett as Christopher Marlowe round out the cast with fine performances.<br/><br/>The story is quite entertaining. Screenwriters invest the script with a healthy portion of Romeo and Juliet's dialogue and Shakespeare's sonnets that only make the movie more amusing. The story of Romeo and Juliet is familiar to us all, and the movie parallels the story in surprising and charming ways.<br/><br/>The most ingenious aspect of the movie is how elements of Shakespeare's plays have become so ingrained in our movies, television, and theater, even though they were cliches in Shakespeare's time.  This movie actually manages to breathe life into all the old cliches thanks to a wonderful exuberance and a fantastic cast.<br/><br/>An intelligent movie that actually rewards the audience for knowing something about Shakespeare, Shakespeare In Love is a treat from start to finish. It makes literacy look sexy and makes sexiness look mature, a feat most movies only hope to accomplish Grade:A+"
"Jragyn","10","5","8","4 March 1999"," Without a doubt, the best film of 1998!
","""Shakespeare in Love"" is truly genius!  The symbolism of the language and events, the beauty of the costumes, sets, and scenery (not to mention Gwyneth Paltrow) is absolutely amazing.  ""Shakespeare in Love,"" for lack of better words, is a fulfilling -- even profound -- experience.  The language is advanced, but it flows wonderfully.  If you were to shut your eyes and only listen to the words of the actors, you could ""see"" just as vividly as if you were to have your eyes glued to the screen (and trust me -- your eyes ARE glued to the screen).<br/><br/>The love scenes are very tasteful, and even though there is partial nudity, the scenes retain their artistic value.  I feel very strongly that this film will win the Oscar for Best Picture.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" WAS a good film, based on real events (which are easily duplicated), and its emotions came from WITHIN the viewer, whether thinking of personal memories or memories of someone they know.  It took imagination and talent to make the fictional events in ""Shakespeare in Love"" (though BASED on truth) into something so moving and so real.<br/><br/>I respect a movie a lot more when it MAKES me belive, rather than ALLOWING me to believe.  I hope that makes sense, but I really can't think of another way to say it.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" was, in a way, an informative documentary about the horrors of war.  ""Shakespeare in Love,"" on the other hand, drew me in and MADE me belive in it.  My heart aches for a love like that.  We should all be so lucky."

It was the rude awakening that they were fixed, the quality of the film didn't matter as much as the bribes.<br/><br/>It beat Saving Private Ryan for best picture.<br/><br/>And then it beat Bulworth for best screen play.<br/><br/>That was sort of enough to turn my head. Both of them? Bulworth was far from best picture worthy, but best original screenplay seemed as much as a shoe in as Ryan for Best Picture.<br/><br/>And then it went on to win Best score over Mulan, A Bug's Life, and Prince of Egypt which is curious because it didn't really fit the criteria for Musical or Comedy Score as much as it's competition.<br/><br/>And then now, looking back, who remembers it? If it's remembered at all, it's remembered for beating Saving Private Ryan, which has become a classic.<br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love is just remembered for it's sweep of the awards, both at the Oscars and beyond, but not for its quality."
"SILlover","10","8","15","11 July 1999"," This movie is my favorite film of all time.
","The first time I went to see 'Shakespeare in Love,' I went because the commercials on television were hilarious.  So, I went to see it opening day (Christmas), but that isn't extremely special because I see movies on holidays as a rule.  When I left the theatre, I was in love with the film, and the more I thought about the more I loved it.  Later that day, I went to see 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'Stepmom.'  Really bad and decent, respectively.  I thought of them in comparison to 'Shakespeare in Love,' and they got worse and worse and 'Shakespeare in Love' got better and better.<br/><br/>And why shouldn't it?  Gwyneth Paltrow turns out an amazing performance especially since she is using an accent, speaking in verse, and playing four parts (Viola, Thomas, Romeo, and Juliet).  She is also phenomenal in the way she can switch from being horridly funny to evoking tears.  Joseph Fiennes no less of an actor than she.  He brings such life to someone seen as a god to many and he is so believable as this writing giant. Geoffery Rush is absolutely hilarious as Mr. Henslowe. I must say that he will make you roll in the aisles.  Then of course there is Judi Dench, who has a meek 8 and a half minutes of screentime but is so awesome that she won Best Supporting Actress.  And last, there is Ben Affleck, who also has a small role as Ned Alleyn (the prima donna of the group), but will make you laugh so hard that you will beg for mercy.  I'm really not kidding, he has the best lines.<br/><br/>Now, if performances aren't enough to make you see it, there are the costumes.  Or the music.  The music has to be one of the best scores I've ever heard.  Or there's the fights (yes, there are fights in a Shakespearean film), which are hilarious, tense, and full of suspense.<br/><br/>So, if I've been able to laugh at every joke all fourteen (yes, you read it correctly, 14) times that I've seen 'Shakespeare in Love,' I think you'll enjoy it at least once."

"flutesalad202","10","4","6","15 May 2010"," In love with Shakespeare
","Love. Inspiration. Wit. Beauty. Poetry. Adventure. Tragedy. And above all, passion.<br/><br/>Such is the makeup of Shakespeare in Love, an incredible film written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard and directed by John Madden. This film follows the story of William Shakespeare, a lowly playwright struggling to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men. Will Shakespeare, as played by the perfectly-cast Joseph Fiennes, is portrayed in a refreshing new way. History's greatest dramatist and most famous playwright is brought to a surprisingly human level, allowing a connection with his audience that most have never felt. The Bard himself, William Shakespeare, poor and with a bad case of writer's block? William Shakespeare, underestimated and relatively undesired as a writer? Incomprehensible. Yet such is Will's lot in life, at least until his patron, Phillip Henslowe, begs him to write a play to help Henslowe out of debt. Will has talked of a play called ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,"" and Henslowe demands he finish it. Yet Will has not even begun it, and cannot until he finds his muse, his Aphrodite, his inspiration.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes plays the Bard with such aplomb, such passion, such humanity, that he is instantly understandable to even the most Shakespeare-wary audience member. And to die-hard Shakespeare fans such as myself, to see the Bard in action makes it all the more real. The plays, the wit, the writing itself. Fiennes depicts a Shakespeare that no one ever thought of - poor, uninspired - and yet never for one moment do we doubt his zeal for words, for love, and his ability to weave his passion and love right into his words.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow. Simply saying the name leaves me speechless. Her role as Viola de Lessops, and within the movie, as both Romeo and Juliet, is simply astounding. She won the 1999 Oscar for Best Actress, and there was never any doubt that she would. From her first close-up, her radiant beauty is breathtaking, and her fervor for poetry transfers from her character to her audience. Lady Viola is first seen attending one of Shakespeare's plays, whom she of course reveres. Being a wealthy and beautiful young lady, she immediately attracts the attention of the priggish Lord Wessex (Colin Firth, in a hilarious role as the inept villain), who needs her father's money to pay off his debts. Wessex's attempt at poetry consists of saying it was her eyes that made him decide to marry her - no, it was her lips. Yet, as Viola so aptly says, ""All the men at court are without poetry. If they see me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love, above all. Not the art form, postures of love. But love that overthrows life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart with nothing to be done come ruin or rapture! Love as there has never been in a play."" (Paltrow's delivery of said line is reason enough to see this movie! AMAZING!!!) <br/><br/>Enter Will Shakespeare! A chance meeting at her father's mansion has the two immediately in love (although Viola already loved the persona of Shakespeare, through his plays), and thus a passionate affair ensues. Will is inspired by Viola's beauty and ability to take his words and bring them to life; thus, he begins his play, Romeo and Juliet. The play mirrors the lovers' circumstances â€“ star-crossed lovers forced apart by their society after only a short, passionate time together. Viola longs to be an actor, but as women were barred from the stage, she must act under the disguise of Thomas Kent. She is cast as Romeo in Will's play, and goes through rehearsals until she is discovered as a woman, and the play is closed. At the last minute, Shakespeare is offered a new theater, and the play reopens, however as Viola was playing Romeo, Will must take over the role. Then, after the play has already begun, the boy playing Juliet experiences the voice change of puberty, and Viola must take the stage as Juliet to Will's Romeo. Their passion and love for one another and for beauty and poetry allow them to play their roles as we the modern audience have never seen before. Yet, Viola has already married Wessex, as Queen Elizabeth (the incredible Judi Dench) has commanded of her. So their performance, while it wins a wager Will had made that a play could truly capture the essence of love, mirrors their own lives, and is their farewell to each other. As even a Queen cannot break a lawful marriage, Viola and Shakespeare part, never to see each other again, and Shakespeare immortalizes Viola in his next play, Twelfth Night.<br/><br/>I promise that you have never seen such a beautiful period film, nor one with more passion, nor one with more beautiful words or performances. The costumes, makeup, sets, all are superb and very accurate to Elizabethan England. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are completely perfectly cast, and Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is undeniably astounding. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Ben Affleck (who manages to be decent AND funny in his small role as Ned Alleyn! Seriously!), Imelda Staunton and Rupert Everett simply excel at their parts, whether they bring comic relief, tension or mere dry humor to the script. See. This. Film. NOW! It is astounding, and it boasts breathtaking beauty in its sets, locations, actors, costumes, script and performances. It doesn't get any better than Shakespeare in Love."

","Fair enough, 1998 may not have been the best year for Oscar contenders, but there were definitely some better movies than this out. Why not give the prize to Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore', or Todd Solondz's 'Happiness'. Why not be really controversial and look overseas, Sweden's 'Show Me Love' and Germany's 'Run Lola Run' are fabulous examples of film-making...and no doubt all films mentioned are massively superior to Shakespeare in Love. The Academy awards had already embarrassed themselves and proved that their shiny golden statuettes aren't worth the stand they're presented on with the handing over of 'Best Picture' to the abominable 'Titanic' over the massively superior 'LA Confidential', among others. I would have thought that they would want to redeem themselves in the eyes of their loyal followers the next year, but obviously they simply don't give a damn. In spite of having a good premise; a love story that fuses the central themes of Romeo and Juliet with events from the famous author's life, the film simply falls flat. It's a tedious and rather dull affair.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that the crew didn't try to make the best of it; it's got energy and a camp style that would have been great if it wasn't out of place, but something is wrong and the movie just cant seem to give itself what it needs to succeed. Too many British films seem keen to implement camp British humour, and although it works now and again; it certainly doesn't always, and it is that implementation that is this movie's main vice. Because of it's campy style, it is difficult, if not impossible, to take the central romance seriously and because of that the film is never going to work. The humour does give the film an element of originality, but unfortunately it's one element that it is better off without. The cast is impressive, as it features a wealth of talent, but none impress much. Joseph Fiennes doesn't have enough charisma to take on a meaty role such as Shakespeare himself, and Gwyneth Paltrow simply looks out of place among the rest of the cast. On the whole, the film is neither funny nor touching and since those are things it strives to achieve, it fails."
"Tomcat-18","Null","6","11","19 October 1999"," I think many of you are missing the point
","Saving Private Ryan? Pants. Thin Red Line? Pants. Shakespeare In Love cannot and should not be compared to these movies for one simple reason - it isn't one of these movies. And why war films should be singled out for distinction when they are themselves rehashed or strangely and continually perceived as being 'powerful' or 'artistic' or 'sensitive' is beyond me. I'm not saying that they are necessarily bad films in themselves, but I think it's time you tried to broaden your horizons a bit. Shakespeare In Love seems certainly to have been received on two levels. Historical relevance and accuracy is not the aim of the film - no more than it was with Braveheart. The latter seems consistently raved-over, and not without some cause - I rank it as one of my favourite films, even though it is essentially a pure flight of fantasy (I love one reviewer's comment - ""I look forward to the sequel"". Come off it!). SIL contains a continual stream not just of 'in-jokes' but of humour at its cleverest and driest. It is an engaging and almost plausible theory of how the great bard came to write one of the great plays, and how others may have followed. The very fact that it is almost a convincing film singles it out as an achievement in inventive, entertaining script writing. The fact that it has been so well received on this side of the pond precludes the theory of its Englishness appealing to the Academians; it is simply an engaging love story whose humour suits the background knowledge and style of humour found here. Sorry guys - but if I wanted a decent war movie, I'd take Where Eagles Dare; if I wanted a trip into the surreal I'd settle for Jacob's Ladder; if I wanted a poignant, historically accurate, and powerful war movie I'd take Schindler's List. And if I wanted a clever, witty and original twist on two old themes, I'd take Shakespeare In Love. It deserved to win recognition, and failure to observe this precludes criticism of all but the most basic films to be found on the silver screen."

","There was quite a bit of understandable controversy over the Best Picture Oscar for 1998, because Shakespeare in Love and Saving Private Ryan were both tremendously good films, and the audience was very divided between the two. There is a definite popular influence on the workings of the Academy Awards (no matter how good a film is, it will never win a Best Picture Oscar unless it is hugely popular like Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love. This is exactly why Memento never won a Best Picture Oscar), but in this case, I think that the quality of the historical element was one of the things that caused the Academy to sway more toward Shakespeare in Love than Saving Private Ryan. Obviously, both had enormous historical value, but I think that there are some notable differences between the two.<br/><br/>First of all, Saving Private Ryan is, for the most part, a presentation of true events that occurred during World War II. It is a spectacular portrayal of true events in American history, and should definitely be recognized for that. The fact that Saving Private Ryan did not win the Oscar does not mean that it is not widely, and correctly, considered to be one of the greatest war films ever made. In my opinion, the Oscar was given to Shakespeare in Love because of the enormous effort that was put into the film's story. Private Ryan had a great fictional story as well, but it is much more complicated to come up with such an elaborate story of something that may have happened in Shakespeare's life, and to tie that story in with what little we know about that life, than it is to create a fictional and touching story that takes place during war times. <br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love takes the unfortunately small amount of information that we have about Shakespeare's life and brings it to the screen in an amazingly realistic way. We know that this is all fiction, but the fact that it fits so well with the content of his plays and the society that he lived in makes it magical, because Shakespeare is literally brought to life for everyone to see. We get something brought to the screen that people have wondered about for centuries, so of COURSE it should win the Best Picture Oscar!<br/><br/>
Granted, from the few portraits that survive, William Shakespeare was probably not nearly as attractive as Joseph Fiennes, but hey, Hollywood had to have its influence somewhere, right? Fiennes delivers a brilliant performance in this staggeringly well-made drama, which provides one of the best period settings ever created on film. When you watch Shakespeare in Love, you're THERE. And we not only get what would be on its own a fabulously developed and interesting story, but also some potential facts that interact with what we know about Shakespeare, such as possible inspirations for some of the characters in his plays, the most important of which is obviously Viola (although Shakespeare's infatuation with her does not exactly match her character in Twelfth Night), as well as some of the content of his plays, like Romeo and Juliet. There is also a brilliant subplot that makes Shakespeare himself the main cause of the rather mysterious death of Christopher Marlowe. <br/><br/>One of the main problems with movies these days is that people think that just because you get two great names together (like Spielberg and Hanks), then you have what should automatically be the Best Picture winner for that year. This is a hilariously erroneous way of examining the movies, especially when many of the people who think that way have not seen most of the other contenders for the Best Picture Oscar. Shakespeare in Love may not escape from that prejudice entirely, although I doubt there were many small films that matched it in quality. This is a spectacular drama, it has a remarkable score, brilliant direction, wonderful performances from everyone involved (Judi Dench's earth-quaking performance as Queen Elizabeth should be especially noted), and an ingeniously written script, which explored every element of Shakespeare himself, even going so far as to give him a rather short temper (`God's TEETH am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!'). True, we can't assume that such a great man as Shakespeare didn't have a temper (there are already enough rumors about him, such as the one that when he was writing his plays, he `never blotted a word.'), but quick to anger is not the kind of thing that is generally associated with him.<br/><br/>It is rather unfortunate that Shakespeare in Love and Saving Private Ryan came up against each other in the Academy Awards for 1998, because they are both worth a Best Picture Oscar, but since only one can be given out, I think that Shakespeare in Love has the edge on Private Ryan. Just barely, but it does. Shakespeare in Love is a nearly flawless film, and just such minor things like casting a late 1990s teen heartthrob like Matt Damon as Private Ryan (just in case you thought the movie took place anytime other than the summer of 1998) by itself knocked it at least a notch or two below Shakespeare in Love. The direction was spectacular, and Spielberg was rightfully given the Best Director Oscar, but when every element of the two movies are taken into account and compared, Private Ryan just has to stand aside in the Best Picture category. I stand by the Academy's decision, and I hope that, from what I have said about Shakespeare in Love, those rather misled people who think that Best Director and Best Picture automatically go together will begin to understand why that is not at all true."

","Geoffrey Rush should have played the part, instead of a supporting role. He clearly has the bearing and the depth to bring the fractured soul and eagle-like genius of Shakespeare to the stage. Not that boy, the tall thin handsome one. They coughed up the truth. But this was just the beginning.<br/><br/>This play serves as the ultimate turn-off for potential Shakespeare fans and established ones alike. Skeptical neophytes often dismiss Shakespeare, assuming that fans are merely drawn to Elizabethan pronouns, accents, and costumes. Their prejudice will be confirmed by this picture, if they assume this is a reflection of the real thing. <br/><br/>The language is uninspired, even by Hollywood's standards. Bugs Bunny does a better job of twisting a line. The hallmarks of Shakespeare's writing go missing here. <br/><br/>I wonder - how many people were tempted to read a Shakespeare play who never had, based on a viewing of this movie? Mozart got a better 'shake' with Amadeus, a movie which generated enthusiasm for his music. Amadeus patronized banality, but never sunk below.<br/><br/>Terrible music also.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 3, in honor of the costumes and staging."

","This film was a great disappointment.  I was looking forward to a comedic Shakespeare film and found a dramatic romance film with great set designs and a good performance by Gwyneth Paltrow but not much more.  It was confusing and almost downright boring (not to mention historically inaccurate-it takes place in the wrong year).  SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE played to me like Romeo and Juliet put through a food processor.  Although I am strongly disagreed with by most critics and audience members, and 13 Oscar nominations, I would recommend instead of this film, renting Franco Zefferelli's ROMEO AND JULIET.  That film truly showcases William Shakespeare's unbeatable playwriting genius."

","Yes a cracking yarn with just enough accurate historical allusions in terms of characters and locations to make you forgive the anachronisms. But this was never meant to be an accurate and historical account of Shakespeare's life. What it is, is a funny, joyous and irreverent look at the man and his early work.<br/><br/>Of special note is the way in which the film draws on the plots of Shakespeare's plays for its own plot and then ultimately turning it on its head by representing his subsequent plays as drawing on the plot of story told in the film. Notably of course, The 12th Night.<br/><br/>In fact the film was full of these sorts of ""in jokes"" such as the ragamuffin John Webster (a playwright who would have been the early teen to Shakespeare's young adult) and who is renowned for his dark plots as suggested by his love of blood in the film.<br/><br/>The cast was pretty good although I was at a bit of a loss as to how Ben Affleck got cast in his role. The only thing I can imagine is that the director, casting director and script writers clearly love irony (you only have to watch the play to know that) and perhaps they thought it would be funny having a late 20th century star playing his period counterpart. Almost worked but not quite.<br/><br/>Not a serious film by any means but well done and much more enjoyable than the vast majority of Hollywood rubbish churned out year by year."

He has a good feeling of how Shakespeare might have been like in his daily life. Gwyneth Paltrow is charming playing Lady Viola as well as Thomas Kent. Acting out two different parts is a big challenge. Together, Fiennes and Paltrow, harmonize perfectly. The script uses a lot of Shakespearan quotes which make the movie especially exciting when you are able to recognize them. It also takes a cute bet on how the story of Romeo&Juliet might have developed. All in all, the plot has a lot of action. You won't get tired watching it. The main focus is on Shakespeare and Viola's love story which is adorable but has not future. I highly recommend this movie because it gives you a good insight in Shakespeare's life and his time.

Amongst the turmoil of two duelling theatres fighting for Shakespeare's works, a love blossoms, helping Shakespeare out of a writer's block. High on love, Shakespeare begins on a quest of writing Romeo & Juliet, interweaving his passion with Viola into the play. A bit like Amadeus but without the madness of a genius. This time its the smultzy-waltzy, lovey-dovey romance that takes you away for a pleasant two hours and a bit. And what you heard about Mr. Geoffrey Rush is true.

Set in London during the infamous Plague, the indomintable reign of Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench), and only men (not women) portrayed women in staged plays.  The Bard's latest play, a comedy that was originally titled as ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's daughter"" then changed to ""Romeo and Juilet"", a romantic tragedy.  Top-notch writing and directing and first-rate performances definitely make this film an instant classic hands down.  There are plenty of funny moments throughout the movie and one notable example would be when Shakespeare and his actors get into a hilarious, all-out brawl with another theater owner and his men.  Paltrow and Dench both won Oscars for their memorable performances and I'm happy that the film won ""Best Picture"" instead of ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN"".

I can easily see why audiences unfamiliar with Shakespeares biography, his works and the everyday reality of Elizabethean life and the theatre would not be especially impressed. After all, while they did watch all the film, they really missed about half the movie. It would be like reading Giulliver's Travels as just a voyage adventure without noticing the fact that it's true genius and meaning lies on other levels entirely. There are many, many instances in the film where dialogue or events would seem to be straight forward but in fact allude to other known facts or persons; and therein lies the real humour and appreciation from what is in effect a continuing series of, ""double entendres"". What especially impressed me was the way in which the love story between Will and Viola is played out using many of the actual lines from Romeo and Juliet and with John Madden, the director, seamlessly transitioning the scenes from the bedroom to the stage and back again. I've never seen that device used in a film before with such effect! Deserving of every award it received and made it's main competition at the Oscar's that year, Saving Private Ryan, look like what it really was: a powerfully effective 15 minutes at the front end followed by an unimaginative and franky unbelievable John Wayne type flag waver from there on to the finish line."

Very satisfying in almost every respect, the film's true star is the brilliant screenplay that interweaves Shakespeare's texts with the new story being told.<br/><br/>I admit that I am a bit of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare - when I see one of his plays, I want to see it as he wrote it.  I am not generally in favor of cutting or moving scenes, or otherwise adapting the Shakespeare text.  That is not relevant here, however, because this is NOT a Shakespeare play.  It is a modern day fictional tale using Shakespeare as a protagonist. The genius is in the way that Shakespeare's own poetry is worked so perfectly into the script.

","What were William Shakespeare's inspirations?  Who was his muse?  These are questions that have occupied the thoughts of scholars and lovers of literature down the centuries.  This raunchy, brilliantly witty film suggests sly answers to these questions by showing us Will Shakespeare as a very real young man, with a very real, very bad case of writer's block. His new play, ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,"" is not going well.  He has been paid for the play already, and has debts beside.  He badly needs for inspiration to strike, for his muse to grant him a vision.  The fates are kind, and inspiration does strike in the form of Viola, a beautiful young courtesan who loves the theater and wants nothing more than to act on the stage--in an age when women are forbidden to do so.  Viola's gender-bending deception initiates an avalanche of riotous activity as well as a torrent of literary brilliance for Will.  Romeo remains, but Ethel disappears forever, her place taken by Juliet, and pirate adventures on the high seas give way to the greatest love story of all--one mirrored by the love between Will and Viola, and just as impossible.  Joseph Fiennes is wonderful as Will Shakespeare, bemused and befuddled, passionate and brilliant, clear-eyed and heart-breakingly beautiful.  Gwyneth Paltrow continues to surprise and delight with the depth of expression and emotion in her performances.  The supporting cast is dependable and solid--standouts are Judi Dench as a crusty, scathing Queen Elizabeth and Rupert Everett as competing playwright Christopher Marlowe.  There are plenty of in-jokes and references to Shakespeare's work for the literate crowd, but this rollicking funfest can be enjoyed by more than just English Lit majors.  Perhaps the best thing of all is that, as my friend Jeff said, the story ends well. After all, what else could a good film about Shakespeare do?"

If you were to shut your eyes and only listen to the words of the actors, you could ""see"" just as vividly as if you were to have your eyes glued to the screen (and trust me -- your eyes ARE glued to the screen).<br/><br/>The love scenes are very tasteful, and even though there is partial nudity, the scenes retain their artistic value. I feel very strongly that this film will win the Oscar for Best Picture. ""Saving Private Ryan"" WAS a good film, based on real events (which are easily duplicated), and its emotions came from WITHIN the viewer, whether thinking of personal memories or memories of someone they know. It took imagination and talent to make the fictional events in ""Shakespeare in Love"" (though BASED on truth) into something so moving and so real.<br/><br/>I respect a movie a lot more when it MAKES me belive, rather than ALLOWING me to believe. I hope that makes sense, but I really can't think of another way to say it. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was, in a way, an informative documentary about the horrors of war.

","Clearly some people are able to enjoy this movie as a romantic comedy (I saw one comment headed 'Shakespeare would have been proud'), while others see it as trashy and misguided. My suggestion is that people who enjoy historical dramas, and insights into the creative process of staging etc., also take a look at Mike Leigh's 'Topsy Turvy'. Another era, a completely different kind of production to Shakespeare, but a movie that I think is far superior.<br/><br/>
Why? Well, Topsy Turvy engages with the actual work and era of the authors - in this case, the Victorian light opera writers Gilbert and Sullivan - whereas SinL makes no real effort to link to Shakespeare. Of course, lines are quoted all over the place, but the context is more Monty Python than anything resembling Shakespeare's world. The whole thing is so disconnected, it drifts aimlessly about grabbing bits and pieces of other genres, getting a few laughs from putting modern cabbie banter in the mouth of a river lighterman while attempting to insert a realistic Elizabeth I in the middle of high-stakes drama.<br/><br/>Here was a golden opportunity to bring the past to life and show Shakespeare's work coming together in an accessible but believable way. Instead, Stoppard decided to simply dress up a dumb romance with the trappings of a another era to give it superficial originality.<br/><br/>

","After reading a piece of historical fiction regarding the life of William Shakespeare, I figured I would give this Academy Award-winning film a try while inspired. Unfortunately, what I found was very nearly a complete and utter mess of comedy trying to be mixed with serious themes.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Shakespeare in Love"" weaves the tale of the creation of William Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) ""Romeo & Juliet"" with his strikingly similar romance to Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this production that I wonder where to even begin. Here are the things that really turned me off the most:<br/><br/>-I'm not Shakespeare historian, to be sure, but the plot of this movie seems like complete fiction to me (a real-life romance inspiring ""Romeo & Juliet""). If someone can tell me if this has any basis in fact, please let me know, as I would be very interested. As it were, I could not separate the great play from this cheap effort to produce concurrent narratives. -You can't play Shakespeare off as a goof! Mr. Fiennes may be a better actor in other roles, but he completely lacks the gravitas to play The Bard. -More to the above point, director John Madden is unable to find a medium between comedy and drama. This movie had to be either one or the other, and instead it ends up being neither. In my mind, Shakespeare either has to be taken reverently or be given the ""life and times"" approach, looking at him from a real-life perspective. This film does neither. He's a bumbling fool from beginning to end and somehow magically happens to put together this wonderful play. -Don't even get me started on the casting. Ben Affleck is a joke, among others, while I would say that only Paltrow turns in a decent performance from the entire lot.<br/><br/>I guess what it came down to for me, then, was the fact that I couldn't ""buy in"" to the notion of ""Romeo & Juliet"" being inspired by a real-life romance. That seemed like too much of a reach for me. It is mind-boggling to me, in hindsight, that this film snagged the Oscar over ""Saving Private Ryan"". Talking about your Shakespearean tragedy (!)."

","Passion. Art. Love. Beauty. All in one movie that will leave you utterly speechless. Shakespeare In Love has by far exceeded my expectations and deservedly topped my all-time-favorite-movies list. <br/><br/>I don't know from where to start.. but I certainly know with whom to start; the one and only Joseph Fiennes. Were Shakespeare alive, he would be jumping out of happiness for being depicted with such vigor, heartiness and originality! Fiennes not only has playfully depicted the 17th century dramatist but also added a lot from his own passion-radiating personality - so masterfully and sincerely that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen as long as he is on. As for the ever-radiant Gwyneth Paltrow, she is literally the sunshine of the movie. Her delicacy and sweetness take over the script and setting and even other actors, and manage to put you in a fairytale-like atmosphere. Geoffrey Rush was more than brilliant, as usual, as the money-seeker Philip Henslowe and hugely added to the comic effect. Roughly, the same can be said about Ben Affleck who was surprisingly good as the self-centered yet kind-hearted actor Ned Alleyn. Queen Elizabeth was originally portrayed by the ever-talented academy-award-winner Judi Dench. She manages to mix comedy with grandeur in her representation of the famous Queen. <br/><br/>Although it derives most of the characters from real life, the story is fictional, or at least not proved true. However, it poses a new perspective for regarding history. History, like art, is in the eye of the teller and the listener/viewer. Thus imagination plays the greatest role in relating the events of the story. This will leave you wondering what if this was true?! What if Shakespeare's timeless love sonnets and plays are nothing but the reflection of a larger-than-life romance? <br/><br/>The script is beautifully written and the score is heavenly composed. In Shakespeare In Love, everything is carried to perfection so that it could touch every single cord of your heart."

","Many people bring up this picture as the epitome of an inappropriately-awarded Oscar. I disagree wholeheartedly. I can think of more egregious examples off the top of my head (""Forrest Gump"", ""American Beauty"").<br/><br/>This film was expertly crafted, as the reality of Shakespeare's writing his classic love story was interwoven with his personal love life. Such an innovative plot almost deserves an Oscar for that alone. Despite the underlying love story, it's not so syrupy that you lose interest. The film is also a parody on Hollywood and the concessions made on productions. For example, the major money contributors are given roles in the play, despite their qualifications.<br/><br/>This is a fun, romantic film with great performances all around. Give me a film with British actors anytime rather than the dimwits we have in America. Such a great cast!---Dame Judy Dench, Joseph Fiennes, Jim Carter, Simon Callow, Rupert Everett (in a cameo), Tom Wilkinson and above all, Geoffrey Rush (not a Brit but close). Rush is hilarious and has the best comic lines in the film. The same year he was in one of my favorite films ""Elizabeth"" as he shows his range in playing a serious role--which he nailed.<br/><br/>Gwenneth Paltrow's Oscar was well-deserved--as was Dench's.<br/><br/>The music is extremely uplifting and definitely adds to the buoyancy of the film.<br/><br/>This is a funny, romantic film for adults and is well worth your time."

If I actually identified everything I found unappealing in this film, I would exceed the 1,000-word limit, so I will only point out a few things.<br/><br/>The overly sentimental outpouring of love between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes ruined this movie for me. (It was enough to trigger the upchuck reflex of even the strongest of stomach.) She, while not a BAD actress, was certainly not good enough to win the Oscar that year. (I maintain strongly that the award should have gone to Cate Blanchett, who was brilliant in ""Elizabeth"".) He, on the other hand, cannot even hope to reach the level of cinematic excellence that his brother, Ralph, has. The lack of facial expressions he brings to the role makes his character flat, and completely uninteresting to the point that one can hardly recognize that he is the main character of the story.<br/><br/>""Shakespeare in Love"" was a great blunder, and I fail to see why the Academy gave it seven Oscars. Perhaps this is another reason the Academy Awards are taken less seriously year after year."

"apteryx-1","9","3","5","17 December 2001"," Funny and Intelligent - How on Earth did this win the Oscar?
","One of my favourite movies.  Two intelligent writers, Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, combine to give us their vision of Young Shakespeare as a would-be up-and-coming writer, in the time shortly before he mysteriously changed gear in the mid 1590s and became The Bard.<br/><br/>The problems he faces in becoming established are shown as remarkably (nay, mysteriously) similar to those confronting writers today Â– writer's block, money, producers, and an abandoned wife and children (a woman of roperty  - she has a cottage).  He finds the answer in the form of Gwyneth Paltrow (well, it would work for me) playing the role of her career to date as Viola de Lesseps, daughter of a merchant rich enough to attract suitors from the nobility for his daughter. We know that she is certainly well beyond the reach (for marriage) of a humble player, but she is an early fan of the budding writer, even when nearly all she has to go on is `The Two Gentlemen of Verona'<br/><br/>The humour turns partly on the situation of Will Shakespeare facing modern theatrical problems (which however are not necessarily outside the range of what the real Shakespeare might have faced).  But beyond that there constant Elizabethan in-jokes, pitched so that even those with the barest acquaintance with the life of times of Shakespeare will get some, while others are rewards for deeper study.<br/><br/>Many people who do not like the film ask how could it have won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1998.  I ask the same question  - given that it is so far superior to those normally recognised by the Academy in recent years (I mean, Gladiator?  Titanic?! The English Patient?!!!).  The answer has to be: it is a mystery."
"bsl9","Null","3","5","8 April 2001"," One of the very best movies
","There are several ingredients to a great movie: plot, character, dialogue, certainly. Settings and photography, not far behind. Performances which relate, directly, to the script, and enhance it, which generally means actors of some sensitivity who are either browbeaten into submission by a director or who actually respect the script enough to want to perform it, rather than use it as a vehicle to enhance their own egos.<br/><br/>
SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE satisfies every condition. Indeed, it trumps them, by accepting and meeting the challenge of creating an almost totally fictional story in and around the life and work of the greatest and, hence, most intimidating dramatist of the English language. To create a great costume drama is worthy enough, in itself. To do so while honoring Shakespeare in his own terms, indeed, in, perhaps, rekindling the recently waning fire at his altar, is to reach heights rarely achieved in three quarters of a century of talking motion pictures.<br/><br/>This is a film which shines in virtually every aspect. It's wonderfully cast. Not a performance rings but true. Gwenyth Paltrow, the most notable of the few Americans in the mostly English cast, gives a fine, nuanced performance as the mythical mistress of a mythical version of Shakespeare, notable both for itself, and because so many American attempts to do period English roles seem to fall flat. Joseph Fiennes, in the title role, is barely less entertaining. And, the strength of the script is such that his limitations, notably, a markedly theatrical take on his role, are appropriate in context, where they might seem odd in a more conventional role. His expressions, alone, are priceless, especially his tortured and/or challenged poet look, an impassioned combination of outrage, astonishment, and constipation.<br/><br/>The casting, large roles and small, is excellent, and if it does run a trifle to stereotype, it's entirely in keeping with the context, as the drama of the age ran to stereotype, as well. Classics, after all, deal with eternal truths and there are only so many ways for people to act. One of the reasons Shakespeare holds up over four hundred years is because so many of his characters are recognizable, even in radically different times and places.<br/><br/>The film's greatest strength, though, is it's script. Is there another scenarist alive who was better suited to this, specific sort of effort than Tom Stoppard, whose early prominence was in no small measure based on his ROSENCRANCE AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD, a play set behind and among the scenes of HAMLET? In an age when strong, classically based writing has fallen so far out of style as to be a rare curiosity, it's splendid to see work which is not merely ""informed"" by the works of Shakespeare, but which revel in them, and the history of that age, and which play with the canon like a singer descanting on a great melody.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is, above all, a writer's script. It looks like a work about the theater - itself, a hallowed tradition in movies - but it's really a script about writing and writers and the process of creation, in all it's dirty, shameless, improvised glory. There's more practical description of real writing in this script than in many a graduate program. For that reason, as much as to pick up the delicious satires on various bits and pieces of Shakespeare's best known lines, this is a movie which bears rewatching. Stoppard has both the language and, even, the rhythms perfectly. When's the last time you listened to dialogue which sang, as good Elizebethan drama, which was written as poetry, or quasi-poetry, sang?<br/><br/>This movie, incidentally, works beautifully as the first of a double feature with the Trevor Nunn/Imogen Stubbs/Ben Kingsley version of TWELFTH NIGHT, a work whose creation figures in the conclusion of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE."

","1998 was a great year for films and it made me sick to see this film win the Best Picture Oscar and Gwyneth Paltrow the Best Actress award. ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a witty, funny, but somewhat childish film that tries to make the life of a dull historical figure seem interesting. It succeeded in that regard with interesting characters and a watchable story (even though it is completely fictional). The production values are high and the costume designs are excellent; however the acting is sophomoric for the most part. How Gwyneth Paltrow ever beat Cate Blanchett from ""Elizabeth"" is beyond me. Every other Best Picture nominee was better than this film; I mean all four of them (""Elizabeth"", ""Life Is Beautiful"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""The Thin Red Line"").

The best thing about ""Shakespeare in Love"", which was Joseph Fiennes' performance, was almost completely overlooked.  Judy Dench (who although is an excellent actress) was excessively praised for only eight minutes of screen time.  And of course, the most obvious ""praise"" that this film has received was for the overexposed and overrated Gwyneth Paltrow.  In this film, all she does is speak with a British accent, put on a boy's clothes and a mustache, and show her breasts--those are all things that could've been done by virtually any actress.  Yet, Gwyneth went on to win several awards for one of her most dull performances.  She gave a more challenging performance in ""Sliding Doors"".  Meanwhile, Cate Blanchett in ""Elizabeth"" was beyond overlooked for one of THE best performances ever.

This movie brought Shakespeare to life in ways I never thought possible.  I had tears in my eyes when I realized how much the movie would parallel the play.  But because it's not the same as the play, familiarity with Romeo and Juliet doesn't ""ruin the movie"" for you, it makes it even better.

In this film Shakespeare during the making of Romeo and Juliet falls in love with a woman that inspires him to write the play in the first place. There is one positive in this entire movie and that is Judi Dench. Her performance was great and she only on screen for 10 minutes, but it wasn't really Oscar good, but that's in the past. As for the rest of the film it is easily one of the most boring and predictable movies ever made. Gwyneth Paltrow is stale and is mainly just eye candy for the main character and she doesn't do anything that great. As for the rest of the performances they are okay to good nothing that great.

First, the script is an endlessly clever piece of writing. The more you look at it the more you see in it. I always pick up on a new facet and/or joke when I re-watch the film. This time I noticed that as the Comedy of Romeo and Ethel transmutes into the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet Shakespeare in Love has transmutes from a farce into a dramedy. The script is a loving homage to the Bard and many of his common plot devices are deployed with wit and vigor. Play with a play, mistaken identity, crossdressing, a twist a fate etc. all get referenced and used to in delightful ways. The script is just perfect and has more layers to it than people give it credit for.<br/><br/>Likewise, the acting is uniformly excellent. Affleck is the perfect ham.

","Shakespeare in Love forces me to think back to a conversation the late Gene Siskel and his comrade Roger Ebert had on their show one day about the nature of movies, and the idea that encompasses them.  A paraphrased Ebert argued in favor of black and white films because they enhance the whole idea that (paraphrased) ""We, the audience, are taken into a room where the lights dim and for two plus hours we are taken into a dreamy almost surreal world."" And in my mind, Shakespeare in Love perfects this, in accomplishing this very objective, as Siskel and Ebert believed, of movies as works of art.<br/><br/>The film itself was a glorious story told with such brilliance and wit that made it very surreal and dreamy.  And much like a good dream that one hates to wake up from, I found myself ready and willing to sit for hours more as Viola made her way across the sand in the end of the movie.<br/><br/>There was a tremendous amount working in this film, most of which I credit to the writing.  The parallel of what was going on in the film, with what was going on in the play, was so very Shakespearean.  The use of plays within plays is one of Shakespeare's favorite devices, and Stoppard used it with such a brilliance as we the audience watched the development of Twelfth Night-like plot twists on screen, as the film actors, played actors, who acted out Romeo and Juliet on their stage.  Anyone who knows Shakespeare, surely understands how completely awesome this writing is.<br/><br/>As for some of the technical aspects of the film... I did not much care for some of the jump cutting that John Madden used in some of the scenes (i.e. dance scene between Will and Viola) which I am left to assume his purpose in doing so was to show the instant chemistry between the two lovers.  Not really necessary in my mind and frankly, I found it jarring, for more often than not, it (the camera) moved in the opposite direction that the actors danced in, indicating confusion, not synchronization between the two.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my final point, that being the under-appreciation of writers in Hollywood.  Newsweek recently published an interview with Stoppard, Begnini, Beatty (Ha!) and two other screenwriters, whose names have escaped me.  The article only reinforced my belief about the necessity of good writers in Hollywood and the unfortunate lack of respect that they get.  After reading some of the critical reviews I am glad to see that Tom Stoppard (who I read somewhere as being, ""The only man smart enough to put Shakespeare's words in his mouth."") is receiving at least some of the credit he deserves.  Without knowing how much Marc Normand helped Stoppard, it is difficult for me to either exclude him or give him the same credit as Stoppard for he has neither a ""Rosencrantz"" nor a ""Guildenstern"" in his filmography.  (A small plug for those of you who haven't seen another of Stoppard's wonderfully written films, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, which I believe he also directed).  I will reside to the fact that the film was well directed, but I can only commend Madden half-heartedly, for most of his success, I believe, comes about as a result of his standing on the shoulders of others (i.e. Judi Dench in Mrs. Brown).  Personally, I think there are a number of directors who would have done a fine job working with the writers to bring the story to the screen.  Perhaps there will come a day when the proper person (Stoppard) will get the majority of the credit regarding the genius of a film like Shakespeare in Love, rather than simply giving it to the default recipient, the director.  Hopefully on Oscar night, Stoppard will get his Oscar, and perhaps one for Madden as well, for the film is nothing shy of Oscar worthy."

","In London of 1593 an ambitious and talented young poet, Will, needs inspiration, characters, plot and muse for the romance he is writing. He finds everything and more in the shape of Viola, a mysterious and beautiful noblewoman in search of adventure, poetry and love. Viola, in turn, finds what she seeks in Will. When a jealous rival for Viola's affections, writers block, mistaken identities, a theater owner with a large debt to pay, and the Queen of England threaten to thwart the two lovers, Will begins to make up the story - what we now know as Romeo and Juliet - as things go along. Fact and fiction then combine, and it is hard to tell one from the other in this ""misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms, feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, and still-waking sleep."" (Romeo and Juliet)<br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love ingeniously and indelicately adds touches of humanity, humor, intrigue and, of course, romance to the often stale and very limited facts that are known about Shakespeare's life and the history of Romeo and Juliet. In making Shakespeare fresh and interesting to a wider audience, and reading between the lines, the film won seven Academy Awards including best picture, actress, supporting actress, writing, music, art/set decoration and costume design. I loved all the nods to Shakespeare's actual work and true history. Gwyneth Paltrow, vivacious and charming, fits the character of Viola perfectly. Judi Dench plays the role of the sharp, caustic and quick-witted Queen Elizabeth equally well. Other A list actors include Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck and Rupert Everett. It baffles the mind that this achieved an ""R"" rating!"

","I would never have expected to be as entertained as I was by ""Shakespeare in Love"", but the humorous way in which it was presented made watching it a genuine pleasure. The situations and characters, such as they are spoofing the works of the great bard, is done with such creativity that one doesn't mind that his famous plays are given a royal send-up. Aside from Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) and his lady love Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), supporting players Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson and Ben Affleck are all hilarious in their characterizations, with a noteworthy mention of Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth. What the picture had me wonder about was how the historical William Shakespeare might have actually spent his daily routine writing plays, sonnets and poems, and if he had to deal with underfunded theaters and lack of paying customers. The man is so famous today you don't really think of him as a mere mortal carrying on day to day with the kind of superficial problems that came up in this story. Erectile dysfunction - who knows?<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a good break from more serious movie fare, but in the grand scheme of things, to win out as Best Picture over ""Saving Private Ryan"", and even ""Life is Beautiful"" is something of a stretch to my mind. Best Costume Design I can agree with, and if there was a category for best Romantic Comedy, then it would have been a winner hands down. Still, not a bad little picture, and who knows, it might even have you looking up a little Shakespeare for your own personal reading pleasure."

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","22 November 2016"," Romance and Genius...
","""Shakespeare in Love"" should have been cinema's ultimate homage to William Shakespeare, not through an umpteenth adaptation, or adaptation's adaptation, to one of his iconic plays, but by putting the iconic playwright within the framework of an original movie plot; original in the sense that it turns him into the subject of a real-life yet loosely fictionalized biopic, a romantic comedy and something of an educational film. We learn a lot throughout John Madden's film, about stage, art, business, royalty and naturally, the genius of Shakespeare, the man who was put in the top 10 of the most influential people of the last millennium, the most highly ranking artist, above Mozart and the Beatles.<br/><br/>I hate to use the word 'multi-layered' because it makes a movie sound like architectural work instead of than something being guided by genuine inspiration, but hey, if anything Madden's film proves is that even the greatest masterpieces were not made by a snap of a finger and were build upon many other factors than inspiration. Like ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a multi-layered accomplishment, a work of art that can be enjoyed on many levels, confidently overlapping, but always with romance at the core. If the film's story isn't likely to leap over the centuries like ""Romeo and Juliet"", it doesn't matter; Will and Viola aren't supposed to steal Romeo and Juliet's thunder but to incarnate the seminal inspiration to the iconic couple. That's their power.<br/><br/>Sadly, for all the reasons that can make ""Shakespeare in Love"", a great journey into love, passion and an immersion in the world and business of theater at the dawn of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the film is remembered as one of the worst Best Picture winners, the one that dared to steal ""Saving Private Ryan""s golden statuette at the 1999 Oscars. Spielberg's war movie was an instant classic, a film that immediately topped all the 'Great Films' list, and to many users and even official websites, it is now an objective truth that ""Shakespeare in Love"" didn't deserve the Oscar. And instead of being a love story about a love story, the film had become a trigger to an enduring hate story with the Internet users. Hated and even loved for the wrong reasons, some would love it just because they hated ""Saving Private Ryan"" with passion, which doesn't say much about both films anyway. Now, where do I stand? <br/><br/>For me, ""Shakespeare in Love"" isn't just one of these conventional costume dramas with sword fights, antechambers' plotting and feather-writing, and this comes from someone who loved the Best Picture co-nominee ""Elizabeth"". The film carries a sort of self-referential wit, as if it was conscious on its own craziness, it starts with the working title of the classic pay ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"", it's funny but it feels real. I mean, did you know that Walt Disney intended to call Mickey, Mortimer Mouse? The process of the creation of the play and how it is shaped by the real life events in the film is the kind of delights I love to see in a film, true or not. The part where Ben Affleck's character suggests Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) to keep the title ""Romeo and Juliet"" had the same resonance than that moment in ""The Social Network"" when Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) tells Zuckerberg (Jess Eisenberg) to remove the ""The"" from ""The Facebook"" or when Zuckerberg says no one can't wear a sign indicating if he's single or engaged, hence coming with one of his most ingenuous ideas.<br/><br/>That's the ransom of success and worldwide popularity, you can find countless inspirations for Romeo and Juliet's key scenes and I love how the two stories drive each other until the ultimate culmination. I also love how it still manages to encapsulate the conventions of its time like the forced marriage with Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), some thrilling duels, a few balcony meetings, nurses, antechambers plotting, and even the cross-dressing that prevailed in the theater at the time, and that earned Gwyneth Paltrow her Oscar. Indeed, women couldn't play in a stage, which makes you realize why comedy was the strongest suit to embody the notion of love. And the film even manages to showcase some daring anachronisms, one of my favorite being the ""psychiatrist"" played by Anthony Sher. In this fascinating mess, you can't tell fiction from reality and you don't really care, for the film is fun from one bit of another, and is populated by a great gallery of British actors.<br/><br/>Now, the real issue, is ""Did it deserve the Best Picture?"" well, even if I didn't give it the Oscar, ""Saving Private Ryan"" wouldn't be my second vote, the irony of 1998 is that it featured two costume dramas and two war movies, ""Life is Beautiful"" has at least the merit to tackle a very thought-provoking idea and make an enchanting fable out of tragedy. Spielberg's film works on one level, which is the terrific realism of the war battles, but that's all, if you get deeper in the plot, you can easily spot some moments where it sinks into manipulative schmaltz, where you realize that this war is between good and evil guys, while it's true that there was an evil ideology ruling the side, you can't make a war movie and imply that every soldier deserved to die, this is too dangerously simplistic. So to all those who believe ""Saving Private Ryan"" was the better one, I want to say why? The answers will all focus on the battles, story-wise or acting-wise, the other movies didn't deserve less.<br/><br/>""Shakespeare in Love"" had the merit to venture in many ideas, many genres, and be enjoyable on many levels. It didn't expect to compete against Spielberg's film, it might have benefited from Weinstein's lobbying, but to hate it on this sole basis isn't the stuff being passion for movies is made on, or constructive criticism."

","Shakespeare in Love was an exceptional movie about William Shakespeare falling in love to help him create one of his most beloved plays Romeo and Juliet. The movie featured a relatively new director named John Madden, who had mostly directed or produced mostly TV series or TV movies. He didn't have to much experience when it came to big motion pictures, so it was already a little risky in inviting him to direct the movie. Luckily, the movie had casted some well-renowned actors including, Gwyneth Paltrow (Sliding Doors, Seven) and Ben Affleck (Academy award for screenplay in Good Will Hunting). Besides the cast, the movie contains a lot of references to Shakespeare that makes the film more enjoyable to those who love his plays. Some include the character Viola (Paltrow) dressing up as guy, which is a reference to Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. Also, when Shakespeare is writing, a paper lands on a skull he has lying around, placing a reference to one of his most famous tragedies, Hamlet. With the many historical references and decent cast, the movie did exceptionally well as it won seven academy awards, including best motion picture and best leading actress (Paltrow). Overall, the movie was well done, leading a rise in fame for those involved, especially the main cast and director."
"romanorum1","9","1","1","15 June 2016"," A Delightful and Spirited Romp
","The setting is 1593 London, in the glory days of the Elizabethan theater. The screen caption reads, ""Two playhouses are fighting it out for writers and audiences: The Curtain Theater with Richard Burbage, England's most famous actor, and the Rose, built by Philip Henslowe."" Plays are often closed because of plagues and bad debts. Because Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) has a cash flow problem, he is literally being legally (?) tortured by Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) at film's commencement. Henslowe saves further pain by explaining that as Will Shakespeare's patron, he is expecting the playwright's latest play within two weeks. The show should garner twenty pounds, or enough to pay off his debt. The working title of the play is ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,"" the precursor of ""Romeo and Juliet."" <br/><br/>In reality, Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) cannot even get started as he has run out of ideas. Now Will needs inspiration. He tells therapist Dr. Moth (Antony Sher) that his quill is broken and that the organ of his imagination has dried up. The therapist advises Will to seek a new romance. Enter Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow). But there are complications, one of which is that Will has a wife in Stratford. Also, Viola has been promised by her rich father to another man, Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), a most disagreeable fellow. Wessex discusses his tobacco farms in Virginia, but he is several decades early! But Viola falls in love with Will, and they have an affair. When aging and sharp-tongued Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) seems to approve of the upcoming marriage, she quips to Wessex that ""Have her, then, but you are a lordly fool. She's been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you. It takes a woman to know it."" Viola loves poetry and wants to act, but she is not yet allowed on stage because of her gender (""the law of the land has our beauties played by pipsqueak boys""). She disguises herself as a mustachioed man, Thomas Kent.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Kit Marlowe has been killed. Will blames himself, as he had misled Wessex into believing that Kit had plucked Viola. But Will soon learns that Kit did not perish at the hand of Wessex; rather he died in a quarrel over a bill at a tavern (In real life Marlowe died at age 32 at Deptford under mysterious circumstances.). There would be a later sword fight between Will and Wessex. When Viola is discovered to be a woman, the Rose is closed down. But then Burbage offers his Curtain Theater, and the play is on. It is successful as the Queen humorously pardons Viola (Thomas!). Of course, Will can never really marry Viola; he works on his next play, ""Twelfth Night."" <br/><br/>While it takes a few liberties, this fictional story well captures the flavor of the late 16th century, and shows the difficulties in arranging for the plays, how they were often racked with financial problems, backstage politics, and court intrigue. The period sets and costumes are wonderfully done. John Madden created a film that is energetic and witty; it is a fine romantic comedy with tongue-in- cheek humor. For the most part, the casting works well. The statuesque Gwyneth Paltrow is quite appealing, speaks Shakespearean well, and artistically displays her ""golden apples"" for folks to admire. She shows great chemistry in her scenes with Fiennes, but in reality she is much too feminine to pass as a man on stage. Judi Dench was undoubtedly authoritarian as Queen Elizabeth. Ben Affleck (as Ned Alleyn), who speaks in modern English, is no Shakespearean actor. Geoffrey Rush has some nice comical lines, like ""That's no one important, that's the author."" Rupert Everett is uncredited as Christopher ""Kit"" Marlow. (At the time, the struggling Shakespeare was engaged in a rivalry with the already popular Kit as to who was the greater playwright. Nonetheless, both do show grace to each other in the film.) The feature certainly was one of the best of the 1998 year, and in fact won seven Academy Awards, including the Oscar for Best Picture."

","Don't be afraid of the word Shakespeare in the title! This movie is not a junior-high history lesson. It's light, funny, romantic, and a totally irreverent look at Elizabethan England.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant. The best writing in a movie I've seen this year. The idea is that Shakespeare is not some grave, great poet, but a young guy trying to make his way in the theater. He's written good plays, but nothing truly transcendent. The conceit is that an ill- fated romance--the one great true love of this life-- with a beautiful, smart woman is what inspires him to write his first immortal play: Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>In this era of world-exploding auctioneers and cookie-cutter Adam Sandler movies, it's rare to see such a specific, ingenious, and inspired story for a film.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is its sense of humor. It plays with history, takes a great man abut whom we know almost nothing, and creates a fantasy about his life that is totally outrageous, funny and real.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is really romantic. The costumes are lush, the leads look great and have real chemistry together. I used to think that Gwyneth was overrated, but here she's radiant. And Joe Fiennes has an intensity and a vulnerability, as well as a sense of humor, that I for one find sorely lacking in his older brother Ralph.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this is the best date movie of the year.

She disguises herself as a man in order to tread the boards and explore her love with the poetic prose of her favourite playwright and suddenly his inspiration returns, from which is borne Romeo and Juliet, possibly the greatest and most tragic love story ever to make the stage.<br/><br/>However, this film isn't tragic. It's a beautifully realised romantic comedy, crafted with dollops of wit by it's writers Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman. They cleverly weave Shakespeare's beautiful prose into their story, and create a concoction both laugh out loud funny and yet beautiful, with moments of tragedy adding weight to what might otherwise be just a fluff. <br/><br/>A wonderful cast play it beautifully. Fiennes and Paltrow are excellent as the two romantic leads, but the supporting cast match them superbly. Special mentions for Judi Dench as an eminently regal Queen Elizabeth, Geoffrey Rush as a suitably put upon and seedy Philip Henslowe, and Tom Wilkinson as Hugh Fennyman, his journey from harsh moneylender to theatre lover being beautifully played. Colin Firth, Martin Clunes, Ben Affleck, Simon Callow, Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter, Mark Williams all contribute to a simply wonderful ensemble of talent, performing this wonderful conceit with the necessary wit and flair.<br/><br/>John Madden brings these facets together and allows them centre stage. The actors and the script weave their magic, immersed in a convincing recreation of Tudor London. It's skillfully done, and the central love story is beautifully entwined with the play, each informing the other.<br/><br/>It's a lovely film and one this viewer is very happy to recommend."
"oOoBarracuda","9","1","1","25 March 2016"," ""We haven't the time to talk in prose""
","The 1998 Best Picture Winner, Shakespeare in Love has suffered from the ""didn't deserve it"" curse. Sometimes, a movie is remembered not on its own merits, but on what it beat out for Oscar's top prize. I have been guilty of this before as well; it took me until I was 27 years old to see Forrest Gump because I was so distraught at the fact that it beat out Pulp Fiction and Network for Best Picture. I've tried not to put movies in this purgatory anymore, but it still happens. For instance, I hardly ever meet someone who has seen How Green Was My Valley, yet I meet a lot of people who scoff that John Ford's magical piece beat out Citizen Kane in the eyes of the Academy. John Madden's feature, starring Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes, and Gwyneth Paltrow is not immune to this phenomenon. Unfortunately, Shakespeare in Love, the story of the Bard finding his muse and writing his most revered play, is more remembered as the bandit that stole Best Picture from Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>A struggling poet and amateur playwright, Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is grappling with a severe case of writer's block. Having already sold a play to theater operator Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), he is racing against the deadline of opening night to have something to give to both the operator of the theater and the audience. He needs the love of a woman to inspire him to write the romance expected of him, but every attempt to find her has proved futile. Meanwhile, Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) a beautiful admirer of theater and fan of Shakespeare's wants nothing more than to act. Since only men are allowed to act in theater, Viola takes on the identity of a fictitious Thomas Kent, dresses as a man, and auditions and is accepted for a part in Shakespeare's next play. Wil sees through her ruse and falls in love with the woman behind the mustache. The two begin a love affair tainted with the knowledge that Wil is married, and Viola has been promised to Lord Wessex. Eventually realizing their union will never endure, the two go on, promising to forever love the other. Viola enters her marriage to Lord Wessex; Wil, finally attaining his muse, goes on to write his next play. <br/><br/>The true treat of this film is its screenplay. This clever, well- written script will have you roped in from the first scene. Marc Norman, Tom Stoppard deserve accolades and were totally deserving for their statuettes for Best Original Screenplay. Aside from how well it was written, the story is very interesting as well. Even though Shakespeare's works are read in high schools throughout the world, very little thought is put into the love life of the man behind the great romances. Costumes were another brilliant treat from this film. Granted, it seems as though period pieces always take home top prize from the Academy, there was the added pressure of also designing costumes to be used as costumes, as much of the scenes comprised of the actors rehearsing the play Shakespeare was writing. Every garment worn by the actors looked uniquely Victorian and produced a well-deserved gold statuette for costume designer Sandy Powell. This film, much like the English Patient, deserves to be viewed on its own merit, and accepted as a fine piece of filmmaking, regardless of the other films that came out the same year. <br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love is a drama and a romance but never gets bogged down by either genre. There are playful moments abound within the film, making it all the more engaging for the audience. My favorite scene of this nature takes place in a bar; Wil is depressed over his writer's block and bumps into revered playwright Christopher Marlowe who gives Shakespeare advice for his play. The authorship of works credited to Shakespeare is heavily debated in some circles with many, myself included believing Marlowe to be the true author. It was a fun nod the film took to recognize this and incorporate it into the film. What was also fun was the repeated allusions throughout the film to other works of Shakespeare's, most notably Twelfth Night. Being a fan of works attributed to Shakespeare it was fun to see these nods within the film; these allusions also made it easier to forgive the historical inaccuracies wrought throughout the film as well. <br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love is a fun look at the inner workings of possibly the most famous playwright to have ever lived. The film is beautiful to watch and captivating due to the exceptional screenplay and costumes. I urge audiences to view Shakespeare in Love, on its own merits; I wager you will be pleasantly surprised. Shakespeare in Love is so much more than ""the film that beat Saving Private Ryan"". If given the chance, audiences will fall in love with Shakespeare in Love."

"Desertman84","10","1","1","15 October 2012"," A Masterpiece Romantic Comedy
","Shakespeare in Love is a romantic comedy drama that depicts a love affair involving playwright William Shakespeare at the time that he was writing the play Romeo and Juliet.It features Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare together with Gwyneth Paltrow,Geoffrey Rush,Colin Firth,Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. The story is fiction, though several of the characters are based on real people. In addition, many of the characters, lines, and plot devices are references to Shakespeare's plays.It is written by Marc Norman and playwright Tom Stoppard; and it directed by John Madden<br/><br/>William Shakespeare is on a cold streak. Not only is he writing for Philip Henslow, owner of ""The Rose,"" a theater whose doors are about to be closed by sadistic creditors, but he's got a nasty case of writer's block. Shakespeare hasn't written a hit in years. In fact, he hasn't written much of anything recently. Thus, the Bard finds himself in quite a bind when Henslowe, desperate to stave off another round of hot-coals- to-feet application, stakes The Rose's solvency on Shakespeare's new comedy, ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter."" The problem is, ""Romeo"" is safely ""locked away"" in Shakespeare's head, which is to say that not a word of it is written. Meanwhile, the lovely Lady Viola is an ardent theater-goer which is scandalous for a woman of her breeding that especially admires Shakespeare's plays and, not incidentally, Bill himself. Alas, she's about to be sold as property into a loveless marriage by her mercenary father and shipped off to a Virginia tobacco plantation. But not before dressing up as a young man and winning the part of Romeo in the embryonic play. Shakespeare soon discovers the deception and goes along with it, using the blossoming love affair to ignite his muse. As William and Viola's romance grows in intensity and spirals towards its inevitable culmination, so, too, does the farcical comedy about Romeo and pirates transform into the timeless tragedy that is Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>One of the most winning and intelligent romantic comedies of the 1990's, Shakespeare in Love is filled with such good will, sunny romance, snappy one-liners, and devilish cleverness that it's absolutely irresistible.Like Shakespeare's work itself, the film is instantly accessible to everyone, from the raucous groundings looking for low comedy to the aesthetes hankering for some intellectual bite behind their entertainment. It is exquisitely acted, tightly directed and impressively assembled, this lively period piece is the kind of arty gem with potentially broad appeal to everyone who would watch this movie. Added to that,it is endlessly witty, visually rapturous, and sweetly romantic,it is a delightful romantic comedy that succeeds on nearly every level as it moves fast and may deserve multiple viewings.A masterpiece indeed."

","I was in awe for a good five minutes after watching this film.  Tackling Shakespeare in a movie is a risky business, but John Madden has really outdone himself this time.  The beautifully seamless connection between Will's plays and his life experiences is unparalleled.  The best thing was, the entire movie experience felt like attending one of the RSC's best plays. Now THAT's an accomplishment.  The cast was magnificent.  I was very impressed with the acting chops of Gwynneth, Joe Fiennes, and Ben Affleck. Gwynneth and Joe had more onscreen chemistry than I can remember in a very long time.  I felt my own heart breaking as they bid adieu for the last time, and many times in between.  And Ben proved he has excellent comic timing.  I never would have imagined he could do Shakespeare.  And Dame Judi Dench!  It's amazing that so small a role can have such a powerful impact on the tenor of the movie.  She was a perfect choice for Elizabeth.  She needs but to speak, and she commands the rapt attention of her entire audience, both the actors in the movie and the audience beyond the screen.<br/><br/>I haven't felt so giddy with excitement after watching a movie since the Shawshank Redemption.

","Why? Why does this movie have so many Oscars? I guess I would never know.

I think I will never thrust the critics again.<br/><br/>The movie itself is quite entertaining, the decoration is beautiful and it is an almost good fairy tale. But here is the problem. 'Shakespeare in Love' isn't any better than a made for TV Disney movie. It doesn't deserve all these Oscars and nominations. While most of the actors are great they don't have anything to act. I can't even remember Geoffrey Rush's character. Yet, he has an Oscar nomination for this movie. And why did the Academy even nominate Judi Dench? She is a great actress really but she had less than ten minutes screen time. I am saying screen time, not acting. It is kind of insulting to her talent to get the Oscar for a movie in which she doesn't have anything to play. I would be much more happy even if she was nominated for the role of M in the Bond movies. And what's it with the best writing award? This is just another story of how love defeats anything. No one would even notice it if there was not Shakespeare's name in the title. There are thousands love stories better than that. What makes this one so special? Well, that is it. I didn't like the movie. May be if there weren't so many undeserved awards I would rate it with 5/10 or 6/10. But with so many Oscars it should have been much better."

","I know it's fiction, but you'd think that they'd get a few things right. Shakespeare lived in Bishopgate outside London at the time he wrote ""R&J""; there wasn't any reason to have him living in a rooming house within the city. Burbage's home was The Theatre, which was owned by his father, James; he wouldn't move to The Curtain, which was also owned by his father, until 1597. But, I digress...<br/><br/>Ned Alleyn married Philip Henslowe's step-daughter in 1592, making the men partners in The Rose. Alleyn ran the productions and Henslowe handled the money. Even if they were in trouble, it's unlikely that Burbage would have come to the rescue since James Burbage, literally, kicked Alleyn out of the Burbage company when he accused Burbage of cutting him out of his share of the profits. And the real Alleyn was 6' 7""! But, I digress...<br/><br/>I never bought that this Will Shakespeare wrote the greatest plays in the English language: he is a self-centered, unprincipled, horny jerk for whom everyone is a means to an end. He should have tried out for the British track team, with all the running around he does, instead of torturing us with his delusions of genius! And what's with the Mad Max get-up? But, I digress...<br/><br/>How did Viola learn of the audition when she wasn't at the bar? How did the Queen know Viola was ""Master Kent"" when she was a last-second replacement for Sam? Why didn't the Nurse investigate the ruckus in Viola's bedroom? Why didn't Wessex break his contract? He could have sued for damages, and De Lesseps would have been ruined. And Will just happened to be in the same church in a desperately-cynical attempt to save his immoral mortal soul Viola was at, praying for HIS immoral mortal soul?

","This movie shows the power of marketing. As history clearly records, the Weinsteins shoveled this thing down the throat of every Academy voter - the first instance of a studio bringing the ""academy campaign"" to the public's attention. They created a false buzz about how good the movie was, immediately setting off a ""me too"" reaction. No one wanted to be the critic who didn't ""get it."" The same thing later worked for that piece of high-school drama level garbage - ""Titanic."" <br/><br/>Before this film was up for Oscar contention, all the payoffs, favors and heavy-handed sales-pitches went on behind closed doors. However, the scheme was a resounding success because this very mediocre film, with very decent, yet not exceptional, performances, took home three Oscars - including best film. To anyone who isn't aware of how Hollywood works, don't for one instance be fooled into thinking this was really the ""best picture"" of 1998. It just had the hardest-hitting academy campaign. And because it won best picture, some audiences have convinced themselves that what they saw was actually something special. Marketing - it can work miracles.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is definitely a lot of fun to watch. While it's got its moments of melodrama, Fiennes is affable and does a nice job of giving a silly story some gravitas. Judi Dench, who laughably won the Oscar for best supporting actress, despite having only minutes of screen time (remember that campaign!) is quite effective - very cold but with a noticeable undercurrent of humor at the absurdity of the existence of a ""Queen."" The weakest performance is Paltro, who does a fine job, but never draws you in enough to care much about her character. The big finale, which is supposed to be a gut-wrenching separation, never reaches that emotional level because Paltro fails to convincingly expresses inner desire. Oh well. Who cares - it's good clean fun while it lasts!"

Translation between both levels is pretty direct: the poet transfers his feelings in verses, without any considerable modification, and the better we know the life the better we understand the work. Too bad that this movie is historically so very unprecise, and that it omits the (if we are talking about Shakespeare's ""love""!) crucial fact of the master's bisexuality. - Other circumstances as Fiennes' completely exaggerated play and the absence of any true humor make this opus one of the poorest we've seen in the last five year's."

","Shakespeare in love is a wonderful film, full of everything - humour, romance, history, moments that make you want to cry, or moments that just make you think - and there are some wonderful little touches. Bits that you wouldn't notice the first time round. Will Shakespeare is played wonderfully by Joseph Fiennes, so well I wonder why I haven't stumbled on him before. Gwynneth Paltrow makes a wonderful ""Juliet""-type character - innocent and sweet and young and well, drop-dead gorgeous. Judi Dench is very overpaid for her minute or so that she plays as the queen, and play it well she does. I absoloutley adore Ben Affleck's performance as the big-headed Ned Alleyn - he has some wonderful lines: Will: Thank you sir, thou art a gentleman. Ned: And you sir, are a s**t-house. I can only assume that the casting director is a fan of the fast show because three of 'em are there, one as the prologue, and two as taxi-boat drivers, and very good they are indeed. Stuff I loved: Will's little ritual of spinning round before he sat down to write; Will's wonderful ink-stained knuckles; the taxi-boat driver bit ""I'm a bit of a playwright meself""; the wonderful joke about John Webster; when that guy says ""well that'll have 'em rolling in the aisles"" and many many more besides. All in all, an excellent film - certainly one of my top ten (probably only 'cause I'm an actor and I love Shakespeare. Oh, and sex scenes).

"ljp-2","3","3","6","2 February 1999"," vastly over-rated, emotionally fraudulent film - without a clue about Shakespeare
","This was a film I had truly wanted to see -- since I'm a history student, a theater buff, and a great Shakespeare fan.  I'd also heard or read a lot of critical raves. I was very disappointed. To make matters worse, I saw it on the night before the Golden Globes aired, and then it went and won so many awards! I can't believe I saw the same movie everyone was praising.<br/><br/>What I got was some pretty surface historical recreation, some attractive actors doing their best, some hoary, but still funny theatrical jokes -- and a very clever, but emotionally fraudulent script, that didn't illuminate anything about ""Romeo and Juliet"", the nature of love, Shakespeare's life or process of composition, or much of anything else.<br/><br/>Of course, I realize the film was fiction, but fiction must at least be imaginatively or emotionally plausible, even if not historically accurate.<br/><br/>I am a romantic at heart, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. But I have a hard time with the notion that you could explain the appeal of this great play about a love that is eternal, with no room for compromise, that fights all obstacles, with no alternative but death, by what actually supposedly happens between Shakespeare and Viola in the film. What we have is a writer who is rather cynically hoping to find a woman he can use (use is the word) to get his ahem, quill working (the anachronistic Freudian jokes about this set my teeth on edge). After trying to interest one woman, Rosaline, he goes for Viola. When he first sees her and is inspired by her, he says ""Was I a poet before now?""  The Romeo of the play, you might remember, says ""loved I ere now?""  (Think it over -- there's a big difference). This callous fellow inveigles Viola into an affair, conveniently forgetting to tell her he's married. Their affair can't and doesn't last, nor do they seem to think it should.  What does this 1990's style ""Melrose place"" affair have to do with the type of feeling embodied by Shakespeare's young lovers?  You might as well say that the romantic woes of Bill and Monica were the source for ""Romeo and Juliet""! The truth is that people in the 1590's really did think very differently about the subject of love than they evidently do in the 1990's. (R+J is a play, remember, is a play about marriage). The authors of the screenplay don't even seem to have noticed this historical discrepancy, or to have made any use of the irony it implies.  Apparently, most of the audience didn't notice it either.<br/><br/>In addition, why is so much being made of Viola as some kind of proto-feminist heroine?  The filmmakers seem to have prided themselves on this, though they haven't achieved plausibility even here.  If Viola is so independent-minded, why doesn't she ever make more than a token protest about her arranged marriage to that pompous jerk Wessex?  She slaps his face in one scene, then a few scenes later, inexplicably decides to marry him. Did I miss something?  I don't think the screenwriters really devoted much attention to consistency in her character.<br/><br/>As I mentioned about, I did like the attractive cast.  Both Joseph Fiennes and Gwynneth Paltrow are fabulous-looking, particularly in their period costumes, and they both have a lot of charm. I think Paltrow in particular is developing into a fine actress -- I only wish she had been given something better to play.  Geoffrey Rush was funny, Ben Affleck, too.  Some of the comedy about the woes of trying to mount a theatrical production was good, even if broadly played.  But it was no substitute for what wasn't there.<br/><br/>A film that really delves into Shakespeare -- beautiful idea.  I hope someday one will be made.<br/><br/>(TG-5, I agree with you.  The only really intelligent view I read was the one in the Village Voice)."

","One of the best romantic comedy films, not written by Richard Curtis, but still brilliant, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director John Madden (Mrs. Brown). It is the late 16th Century, young Globe Theatre play-write William 'Will' Shakespeare (BAFTA nominated Joseph Fiennes) is having writer's block trying to come up with the new play, currently titled ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" (which later becomes ""Romeo and Juliet"") with budgeting from Richard Burbage (Martin Clunes), and friends including Philip Henslowe (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Geoffrey Rush), to entertain Queen Elizabeth I (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench, on screen for only 8 minutes in 4 scenes). A fan of Will's, rich Viola (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Gwyneth Paltrow, with her very convincing British accent), who is to be married to the cold-hearted Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) wants to be an actress, so she dresses as a boy and auditions to become Will's Romeo. Eventually though, Will finds out Viola's true identity, and they have a passionate forbidden romance that gives him inspiration for his successful play, becoming the most famous love story of all time. Also starring BAFTA nominated Tom Wilkinson as Hugh Fennyman, Ben Affleck as Ned Alleyn, Simon Callow as Tilney, Master of the Revels, Jim Carter as Ralph Bashford, Imelda Staunton as Nurse, Rupert Everett as Christopher Marlowe, Antony Sher as Dr. Moth, Mark Williams as Wabash, Simon Day as First Boatman and EastEnders' Lucy Speed as a Whore. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Stephen Warbeck, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography Richard Greatrex, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup and Best Sound, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Editing, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay.

And what a talented cast, with Joseph Fiennes utterly charming and handsome as William Shakespeare, and Gwyneth Paltrow in possibly her best performance was by every means captivating as Lady Viola. Geoffrey Rush, who actually looks like the Barbossa character he created in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, was hilarious, and Colin Firth makes Lord Wessex intentionally insufferable. Simon Callow, Martin Clunes and Ben Affleck are solid in their roles, not to mention the wonderful performance of Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth I. Her end monologue was beautifully written and Dench's interpretation was flawless.

"krumski","5","3","7","4 February 2000"," Overrated
","When I first heard about this movie I was very excited because I'm a huge fan of playwright Tom Stoppard, who co-wrote the script. Also, it had a great premise: Shakespeare, at the beginning of his career, looking for that first big hit to really establish his name, is at work on his new play ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter."" He falls deeply in love/lust with Viola de Lesseps, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and is motivated to write ""Romeo and Juliet."" <br/><br/>As actually executed though, the film is. . . well, ok, but not nearly as good as it could have been and just waaaaaay overrated. First of all, Shakespeare as portrayed here is just a simp, all pointless motion and hot-blooded excitement - seemingly interested in scoring women and very little else. There's no suggestion of the eloquence, the wit, or the sheer patience and craft that he would need if he was going to become what he did. In the role, Joseph Fiennes is a complete blank. This seriously undermines the film from the start: we don't have to see the guy being a genius (after all, this IS supposed to be early in his career) but if we don't at least get a glimpse of the potential, we can't really buy it as Shakespeare - and the whole movie simply devolves into Hollywood actors running around with funny costumes on.  (In only about five minutes of screen time, Rupert Everett, as Christopher Marlowe, completely blows Fiennes away in terms of poise, presence and sense of humor - I think he probably would have made a much better Shakespeare.) <br/><br/>All the other performances are fairly strong, causing Fiennes to further stick out like a sore thumb. Nowhere is this as true as with Gwyneth Paltrow. Since the Oscars, there's been a big backlash against her and her performance here (especially at this site) but COME ON, people! - this movie is unthinkable without her! I speak as someone who'd never been all that impressed with her (she was pretty enough, I thought, but as an actress a little bland) but after I saw her in this I became a believer. She has such a grace here, a presence that we don't normally associate with actresses anymore - you'd have to go back to the days of Grace Kelly or Ingrid Bergman to find a proper parallel. Absolutely enchanting - which is essential, because we must buy her as the muse to no less an artist than Shakespeare. I guess what I have to ask is, for all those people who didn't like Paltrow and yet liked the movie - well, what exactly did you LIKE about it?<br/><br/>The script, I'm sure they'll say. But if your two lead characters sink like a stone then exactly how good could you consider the script to be? In any case, I think there's been too much said about this damn script - as if the real story wasn't meant to be about Will and Violet (which doesn't play convincingly), but about all those sly little jokes that the writers sneak into the margins of the screen. They're not even that funny. The more Shakespeare you know, of course, the more of them you'll likely get, but that still doesn't mean you'll laugh; I got several of them, and the most that ever happened was, I said ""Oh yeah, I get that - I understand what they're referencing."" It makes you feel intelligent, maybe, but it doesn't give you any enjoyment. The film tries to be too ""smart"" when at its heart it's just a dumb love story. Perhaps Stoppard was actually the wrong guy for this project - he's too intelligent (anyone who doesn't agree, just check out any of his wonderful plays - like ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"" ""Travesties,"" ""Arcadia,"" ""The Real Inspector Hound"" or any of over two dozen others). The guys behind ""Airplane"" or ""The Naked Gun"" would have been a much better choice. If they'd written it, this film might actually have been FUNNY. Dumb, certainly, but funny. As it is, this film walks a tightrope between silliness and profundity, never firmly registering in either, so never being really satisfying on any level.<br/><br/> It has its moments, and the radiant Gwyneth of course (as well as Judi Dench as a wonderful Queen Elizabeth; she absolutely stops the film whenever she appears which, alas, is not nearly enough) but it's more of a disappointment than a treat."

","I hate this film with a burning passion! There is no way that I will ever appreciate one aspect about this movie, from beginning to end I was stunned by just how dull, uninvolving and pointless it was. There is no reason why it had to be made, what are the film makers trying to prove, that William Shakespeare had sex too? I do admire Shakespeare's work, and I do believe that he is probably the best play writer in history, but if someone was going to make a sem-fictional film about his life, they could of at least made it moving and engaging, qualities completely absent here. The 1999 Academy Awards made a dreadful mistake by naming this Best Picture instead of ""Saving Private Ryan"", which was an immensely better film in so many ways. Just watching 5 seconds of it would be more entertaining than watching ""Shakespeare in Love""'s entire length. But aside from all my negative comments, I can't deny the fact Joseph Fienne's performance as Shakespeare was excellent, and Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal as his lover was fine as well, but it was far from being Oscar worthy. Cate Blanchette's performance as Queen Elizabeth was definitely better than Paltrow's, it's just a shame that the Academy made so many bad choices. A truly disappointing film."

I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, though I do appreciate the artistry of his works, and therefore much of the ""magic"" of this movie was lost on me. And that means what was left for me to see on the screen was a very middle-of-the-road romantic comedy with a plot right out of ""The Mighty Ducks,"" or any other come-from-behind sport movie you can think of. You've got a group of misfit actors (hockey players, baseball players, football players etc.) with a leader who's viewed as a loser by the public at large. He loves a girl who is dating a total jerk but because of social pressure their true love is to be denied. The home team is about to lose everything-- they can't get fans to pack the stands and are about to go out of business. Somehow Our Hero must turn his lovable band of losers into a cohesive team which he does through a series of wacky encounters. He even manages picks up supporters who were formerly against him, but see what he is trying to accomplish and lend their support. After much preparation, things look like they are going to fall into place. But right before the big game plans fall apart and the mood turns dark: the girlfriend is going to run off with the jock. The best players are sidelined. Some evil official is going to throw the game. The guy who can't do anything right is going to have to make a Big Play. My goodness, how will they ever overcome such odds?<br/><br/>The same way they always do in movies like this. The girl dumps the jock and declares her love for The Hero. The home team pulls out a stunning victory by pure strength of heart that gets a standing-o from the spectators. Even the guy who couldn't do anything right even overcomes a disability and becomes a hero. The crowd goes wild as the underdogs come in for a big win. But it's not over yet! The evil official steps in to declare the underdogs cheated-- the game is lost! But wait! An even higher power (which usually makes an appearance earlier in the film expressing only a mild interest in the game) shows up out of NOWHERE to publicly humiliate the bad guys and to validate the victory of the ragtag band of misfits who worked so hard to accomplish their goals.<br/><br/>This is a very cynical take on the film, but if you think about it, I think you'll agree that the plot is a very standard by-the-numbers affair. I thought the acting, direction and design of the movie were well done but I'd seen the story far too many times before, and ended up being bored as a result. And that, dear readers, is NOT entertainment."

","Taking Shakespeare and transporting it to the cinema is always an audacious gesture, I have said it in other reviews and I repeat it. Here, however, what was transposed to the canvas was the author himself. At the end of the 17th century, we followed Shakespeare's struggle to survive in the artistic and literary world. Uninspired and in need of money, he tries to write a romantic play without success. Everything changes with Lady Viola, a young aristocrat in love with the theater who does not accept that women cannot step on the stage freely, deciding to enter the new production of Shakespeare disguised as a man.<br/><br/>Of course, the script is entirely fictional and none of this has happened to the real bard. Despite the fact that the film is set at the right time and has some historical rigor in relation to the sets and costumes, the historical rigor ends there. The characters behave like us, in the middle of the 21st century, and reveal our mentality, not that of people four hundred years ago. In fact, the film skillfully mixes the two, so skillful that it can be dangerous and give the audience the idea that all of this was true or based on real facts from William Shakespeare's life. The film combines a good romance, the absurdity of the story told and a kind of silly humor that works well and makes the film light and pleasant. If you think about it too much, everything will fall apart, so it is better not to do it and let yourself go.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes is good for the material he was given and what he was asked for. He knows how to be romantic when he has to be and funny when he has to. Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful and makes a good pair with him, they get good chemistry. Ben Affleck is OK, Geoffrey Rush is funny. On the negative side, Judi Dench only appears because it is necessary and will play the queen.<br/><br/>Now let's face it ... the film was highly awarded at the Oscars, with seven statuettes (Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction, Best Secondary Actress, Best Actress). But did the film deserve them? I honestly don't think so. The film is good, but not good enough to earn the highest award in the industry, especially when competing with much more serious and heavy films like ""Elizabeth"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Likewise, Paltrow doesn't look as good in this film as Cate Blanchet in ""Elizabeth"". Judy Dench almost won a career Oscar here because she doesn't even appear for ten minutes in the film. Personally, I think the film deserved only the awards for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Soundtrack and Best Costume Design. But since I wasn't the one who awarded the prizes that day ..."

","There are people who will respond to criticism of a movie they like by saying, ""Well, it's just a movie."" Rather than answer the criticism, they indicate their lack of interest in discussing the movie with that dismissive remark. But then there are those who will respond to criticism of a comedy by saying, ""Well, it's just a comedy."" Somehow, this seems to be a more defensible position, for they are saying that serious criticism may be appropriate for serious movies, but a comedy, by its very nature, is not serious, and thus is exempt.<br/><br/>In reality, the only thing that makes a comedy immune from criticism is laughter. When a comedy makes us laugh, no criticism can touch it; when a comedy does not make us laugh, however, it deserves all the criticism we care to bring against it, even though the absence of laughter says it all. And ""Shakespeare in Love"" is just such a comedy.<br/><br/>The Academy is hesitant about handing out the award of Best Picture to a comedy, because that would seem to be beneath the dignity of the institution. ""Shakespeare in Love,"" however, being about the title character, insulates the Academy from being thought lowbrow, thereby permitting its members to embrace such a comedy. The fact that the movie is not really funny did not bother them. All that mattered was the glow of culture that radiated from the Academy when they voted for this film. In short, a movie about Shakespeare is Oscar bait, and the members bit.<br/><br/>Nietzsche once said that Homer would never have created an Achilles, nor Goethe a Faust, had Homer been an Achilles, or Goethe a Faust. This goes contrary to the way a lot of people think. They like to imagine that an author must be like the characters he creates. ""Shakespeare in Love"" plays off this notion, for it would have us believe that Shakespeare's inspiration for ""Romeo and Juliet"" was that of a real life love affair that he had, with all sorts of parallels, balcony scene included, between what happened to him and the play he finally wrote. But to paraphrase Nietzsche, Shakespeare would never have created a Romeo had he been a Romeo.<br/><br/>The movie dares us not to be amused, even if we cannot bring ourselves to laugh. Bits and pieces of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" along with some of Shakespeare's other plays, are strewn throughout the movie in a disorganized way, the idea being that the elements of all these plays just need to be put together in the right way, as we know they eventually will. Every such reference flatters us for catching the allusion, and we can display our sophisticated familiarity with these quotations from plays not yet written by chuckling, whereas if we merely sit there in the movie theater without exhibiting the slightest bit of mirth, others may think us lacking in culture and refinement.<br/><br/>When we watch a Shakespearian comedy being performed today, and find ourselves not laughing, we are willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. We allow that it might have been funny when it was first performed four centuries ago. With ""Shakespeare in Love,"" we know better."

","Shakespeare in Love is that rare movie that is grounded in literature in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>The plot is ingenuous, especially for a modern day film, where plot matters hardly at all. To be popular today, a movie hardly needs a plot; All that it needs, oddly enough in this era of supposed women's liberation, is to be the very antithesis of everything female.<br/><br/>That's right, fair reader. Create a war movie, a spy movie, a brutal movie, that caters to male sensibilities, and you have a well thought of movie, here in IMDb most certainly.<br/><br/>Shakespeare in love is predictably ranked a lowly 7.8 here on IMDb precisely because it trumped Saving Private Ryan, a boring and pedestrian movie that catered to the masculine idea that if a film is about war and men bashing one another about, it somehow reeks of wisdom and insight into the human condition. The truth is, there is ten times more insight contained in the first ten minutes of Shakespeare in love, than in any dozen godfathers or goodfellas, but the male contingent will not hear it.<br/><br/>This era belongs to the men. Females are second class citizens both in the audience and on screen these days. How else can one explain the ratings of drek like Saving Private Ryan and the holy crusade which surrounds it and the perceived slight it received when Shakespeare in Love beat it for best picture of 1998? So as a woman, I feel it my duty to point out that women are not BEING SERVED by the current crop of films, and have not been served for a very long time. Long live films like Shakespeare in Love which dare to be different, and which give hope to those of us who put plot above brutality."

","""Shakespeare in Love"" demonstrates writing, acting and production of the highest quality. We see my favorite criteria for judging a film - creativity, humor, love, mystery, romance and adventure - rise time and time again to their high-water marks. I was particularly impressed with the fact that Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman understood that Shakespeare was truly in the entertainment business, and show us a conflicted Shakespeare whose writing is being constrained by his producers. In ""Romeo and Juliet,"" Shakespeare breaks from the popular stage-play themes making their rounds in the city, and is successful in doing so because he shows the audience aspects of human nature, which up to that time had been unexplored in this medium. I wish Hollywood would be willing to take the same chance and produce entertaining, thoughtful and socially redeeming films (such as Tom Hooper's recent success). Hollywood take note, there is a population cohort for whom you've been writing for the past thirty years that has grown up."

Even the performances, are really good here! <br/><br/>'Shakespeare In Love' purports to portray playwright William Shakespeare's involvement in a love affair at the time that he was writing the play Romeo and Juliet. But this story...is fictional! Though many of the characters are based on real people, this is a different take altogether. <br/><br/>William Shakespeare, has gone down a legend, and rightly so. He maybe love tragedy and it's aftermaths, but he was one fine storyteller, who has remained alive among everyone. Prehaps, THE most iconic playwright ever! <br/><br/>Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard's Oscar-Winning Screenplay is full of memorable moments. In fact, each character comes up wonderfully and the Dialogue at places, are note-worthy. John Madden's handling of this story is remarkable. Art Direction, Costume Design, both of which won Oscars, are pitch-perfect. Cinematography & Editing are well-done too.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Gwyneth Paltrow is superb in an Oscar-Winning role, while Joseph Fiennes take on Shakespeare is endearing. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are good, as always. Though an Oscar-winning performance, I thought Judi Dench was alright. Ben Affleck is passable. Tom Wilkinson is superb! Such a Fine Actor!

"Tom-But","10","2","4","10 September 2010"," More talent than you can shake a... spear at
","Shakespeare In Love is, on one hand, a captivatingly magical film and, on the other, a spectacularly manoeuvred success that it would have been tragically easy to screw up. After all, to bring this wickedly funny, self-referential concept to the screen really was the biggest risk of any film of '98, even more so than the mixture of World War II with Roberto Benigni's farcical antics in Life Is Beautiful. <br/><br/>Such daring stems from the fact – one which the producers at Miramax must have been painfully aware of – that one misstep in any sense would have resulted in an absolute ruin of a film, most pertinently in regard to the cast. The wrong actors would have made this less of a playful exercise in fact vs. versus fiction and more of an agonising presentation of B-grade inventiveness. As is, Shakespeare's casting is terrific in the process of placing the right actor in the right part: <br/><br/>Fiennes as the eponymous literary icon remains one of the most watched and simultaneously unacknowledged performances both of his career and of the genre. His most renowned leading role plays like an extension to his supporting character in Elizabeth as Robert Dudley, the Queen's lover; the same poetic charisma is present, but the development through more screen time is very rewarding, allowing the viewer to observe his newfound maturity and at the same time an untouchable light-heartedness and humour that ultimately makes this his most likable film persona yet. <br/><br/>Paltrow likewise is great, as worthy of her Best Actress win as front-runner Cate Blanchett, despite subsequent criticisms. Her romantic and almost childish – in the best possible way – disposition perfectly suits the inspired and unexpectedly insightful speeches that speak of longing for love in such simple terms, phrased so plainly as it never has been before (credit where credit's due to the imaginative vivacity of writing duo Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, whose win for Best Original Screenplay was as much attributed to these intimate moments as any other part of the film). Viola's want to have love in her life and her eloquent expression of its powerful influence is so basic and yet believable, as is her portrayal of a boy, Thomas Kent, a masculine subterfuge that is obvious to the audience but it is not a stretch to imagine that Will and the other characters would be fooled by Viola's con.<br/><br/>Accurate casting reverberates in the supporting players, starting with Geoffrey Rush's skittishly anxious nuisance Philip Henslowe, the primary comic relief to the film and customary idiot, a presence that seems an homage to one of Shakespeare's own creations used to serve the needs of the lowly underlings in the audience, though in a cleverer guise. Any who doubt Rush's credibility as an actor of versatility need simply watch Elizabeth and Shakespeare In Love, witnessing in awe the breadth of his outstanding abilities, ranging from the depth of his dramatic flare to the aptness of his droll obnoxiousness. <br/><br/>Affleck as Ned, leader of acting troupe the Admiral's Men, has only ever been as engaging once before in Good Will Hunting and is even more fun to watch than his sadistic fallen angel in Dogma a year later. The endearing Tom Wilkinson, a crowd-pleaser whose name is not always as well remembered as his familiar face, brilliantly displays the aura of a hospitable medieval gangster whilst also successfully treading the grounds of a theatre appreciator, enthusiastic drunk and anxious player. <br/><br/>British icon Judi Dench, who was virtually unheard of in the US until her Best Supporting Actress win for Shakespeare, does not just steal scenes as the treasured Queen Elizabeth, but commands them; hell, in her total 15 minutes on screen she absolutely dominates every second! In other circumstances, such a description would pertain fittingly to self- indulgence, but there is something so eerily subtle about Dench's performance, which is not so much replication as incarnation. Afterwards, there is little doubt that the true Virgin Queen would have incurred the exact same cautious atmosphere. So much can be praised about Dench's presence: she is uncompromisingly curt and very impressed with her own wit; her costume – one of Sandy Powell's award-winning creations – is incredibly detailed, so loud that it becomes its own character trait; finally, she has a jaded though not entirely humourless impatience, as when she cannot wait any longer for one of her guards to shroud a muddy puddle and so trudges bitterly through it, simply stating, ""Too late, tooo late.""<br/><br/>Location is undoubtedly a key quality of this film, with the England of Shakespeare presenting itself as a much lighter and cajoling setting, full of life and excitement. The decoration of the waterside locales on the Thames, as well as the Thames itself with many small rowboats, is also a successful campaign. The true exquisiteness of this background, however, becomes clear at twilight: as night descends upon central London, this river becomes a vibrant bed of fire, the streets themselves an intricate, enchanting maze; every corner longs to be explored and the viewer can't help but ponder on the surprises lurking behind every turn. Shakespeare by candlelight is enlivened further by Stephen Warbeck's touching and undeniably nostalgic score.<br/><br/>And speaking of music, the spectacularly potent symphony crescendo that rises as the film's theatre audience applaud Will and Viola's performance of Romeo and Juliet is the greatest and most suitable composition of recent memory. <br/><br/>With an accurate balance in style, humour and compassion, to watch Shakespeare is to be in state of constant jovial enjoyment, with the mounting knowledge that the film will be watched more than once, if only just to reaffirm how marvellous it is when everything goes right, when it all could have gone sooo wrong."

","I love Joseph Fiennes and he was excellent in this movie. Dame Judi Dench and Gwyneth Paltrow also turn in top-notch performances. However, the main problem I have with this movie is the script by Tom Stoppard. Stoppard is excellent: I love his Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead and Arcadia,and I know he knows Shakespeare and his time.That is why I find the frequent historical inaccuracies (references to American colonies,incorrect order of the plays, etc) so glaring. Stoppard wrote them, not some hotshot scriptwriter without a clue. He knew and he still messed it up. I like this movie, but as a Shakespeare devotee, I find it sorely lacking. Sadly,this is how most people see Shakespeare. Shame on you, Stoppard."
"TxMike","Null","2","4","15 January 2007"," The story of ""Romeo and Ethyl, the Pirate's Daughter."" Well, almost ...,
","""Shakespeare in Love"" is a good movie for those of us who don't particularly like Shakespeare. Not the man, but his works. I find the stilted old English he uses, and the delivery of lines, difficult to stay with, but I love this movie. Some feel it did not deserve ""Best Picture"", but I don't really care about that argument, I just like the movie.<br/><br/>In a similar vein as ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor"", where a fictional love story is woven through historical events, so is ""Shakespeare in Love"". The period, late 1500s, is correct, as are all the main characters, the ways of doing business, locations, and theaters. What is fictional is the love story that develops between Will Shakespeare(Joseph Fiennes) and lady Viola (Gwenneth Paltrow). While I seldom see Ms Paltrow as a sex symbol in her various films, in this one her bedroom scenes with Fiennes are quite lovely.<br/><br/>In this film, Will is ""stuck"", he is looking for a muse, and is intending on writing a new play ""Romeo and Ethyl, the Pirate's Daughter."" Through many brief interactions with his contemporaries and Viola, the story gradually develops, bit by bit, scene by scene, into the now famous romantic tragedy. To recruit a popular actor (Ben Affleck), who will play Mercutio, Will tells him, ""It will be called Mercutio."" Nearer the end, Affleck tells him, ""I think it should be called 'Romeo and Juliet'. That's just a suggestion, consider it."" What makes this such an entertaining film for me is the inspired writing and directing, which combines a factual period piece with smart and funny dialog. We see characters speaking in a modern language, and while the story line is plausible, the entire film is brimming with humor. Not the kind of ""over-the-top"" schtick that so many recent movies employ with limited success, but the best kind of subtle humor that is the calling card of a fine scriptwriter. It is the kind of film you can appreciate more upon each viewing, and see things you never saw before.<br/><br/>The DVD is also superb, although there is not much surround in the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. A very interesting ""extra"" are facts about the real people who were represented as characters in this film. One of my favorites of all.

","It's not that this is a bad movie. In fact, the costumes are great, very few inaccuracies and those that are are understandable, and lots of historical attention to detail. And the love story is somewhat endearing. It got my heart racing at various parts, but I was just disappointed with the ending. I suppose I was a bit annoyed b/c there's no way to tell if Will's writing is happening to come true (hehe, in which case, she'll be rapidly eaten by something, and not Will) or if he's just envisioning. I'd just assume the latter except that the detail and American look of the wilderness says otherwise. Also, Shakespeare's hair and beard were just stupid, as was his earring. What was w/ the other two guys w/ one dangly pearl earring? Were they just there b/c Joseph refused to take his out so they wanted it to look normal for the time? The stage costumes amused me b/c they were close to accurate for ""Romeo and Juiet"", but Shakespearian actors just wore their everyday clothing for peasants and bought used stuff from nobles for royalty, which would still be modern. Also, I was a bit nonplussed by the amount of nudity. I don't mind it; I didn't like it either. That's not the way you're supposed to feel of nudity if they bother to put it in there, y'know? I got a serious giggle out of Viola's wig! As a wig-loving actress, there is no WAY she got her hair under that wig in the story. Did they have spirit gum at the time? The one guy w/ fake facial hair within the play had it tie on, but she stuck hers on...maybe she just could b/c she had more money. The costumes were way too expensive for either of the troupes."

","There were numerous good movies that were released in 1998; ""What About Bob?"", ""Saving Private Raymond"", ""Ice Age 1"" and ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Trip"" to name a few. However, what made ""Shakespeare in Love"" stand out from the rest of them? When I saw Shakespeare in Love, I nearly busted a nut: it was a breath of fresh air from the usual love stories that we usually see. It stood apart from the others; a pity, alas, because every generation seems to become more distanced from the real poetry. Today, it all seems to have become show & tell, there-you-have-it, reality-TV presentation.<br/><br/>Well, to the footage at hand: The legendary Mr. Shakespeare is depicted very well with some human flaws (farting). It is interesting how this early in his career, some events from his later plays found their way into the movie. (Skull from 'Hamlet,' 5.1) (His sorrowful presence at the altar on his knees bears a similarity to Claudius' remorse in 'Hamlet' 3.3) That said, the story flows nicely. King Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth is depicted rather awesomely. (Especially the way her life enables her to feel an understanding for the object of Shakespeare's adoration.) Christopher Marlowe is shown as the already established writer who offers some assistance to Shakespeare's play still in the writing stage. (SIDE NOTE: Marlowe's ""Two Gentlemen of Rapallo,"" ""King Lear II,"" and ""Massacre At Paris"" are some wonderful plays to peruse.) John Webster was probably not the monster he is portrayed as, but at least his nature kind of hints at the nature of the plays he would write. (His ""Duchess of Malfi"" and ""The Holy Trout"" are bloody, but funny.) Ben Affleck is ribald as the Laurence Olvier of the 21st Century.<br/><br/>WARNING: if you are very serious and boring about your comedies and especially if you like parrot humour, fuzzy kittens, and if you like the movie ""Mr.Roger's Teatime jokes"" then DON'T watch this movie. This amount of ribaldry is just too damn much for you...these jokes will just hurt your little head. This movie would have you believe that the Queen would actually sit with the common folk at the Globe Theater!<br/><br/>The screenplay for this movie is without a doubt, excellent. To nicely intersperse the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Twelfth Night"" into this movie, was delightful to behold. My favorite kinds of movies are ones that are based on histrionics, legends, and nostalgia. I am a big fan of comedies that have stupid humor and political humor, like Monty Python and Mel Brooks. This movie had plenty of that. There's just something about hearing jokes in the kind of accent they used that makes them so funny. It kept me wanting to watch more, even when the mushy stuff was going on.. Either you simply love the Shakespeare-in-Love-gang and their crazy world-perspective, or you love to hate it. If you're in the first group you'll bust your nuts like I did! <br/><br/>Coming to the cast, Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful job in her role. She definitely deserved the Oscar for the expressions of abawdery she portrayed when enacting on stage as Thomas Kent, while looking wonderful and acting gracefully as Viola. Joseph Fiennes acted great too as Will Shakespeare, and the chemistry between him and Viola was charming. (Hard to believe Fiennes was reportedly soused for much of the filming. He seems rock-steady!) The rest of the cast equally, such as John Cleese, Judi Dench and Colin Firth did a fine job on their roles. Ben Affleck was OK -- the funny thing is that this guy probably took it in the can at fraternity initiations, but still hates all things homosexual.<br/><br/>I have an affliction for period piece spoofs but am of the opinion that they could have shown the amazing Nathan Lane more. Hell. I even think Monty Python should adopt Nathan Lane as an official member!<br/><br/>FACTIOD: ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a non-stop laugh-a-thon!. So if you want your spirits lifted, you should watch this masterpiece, as, all in all, there is a zany representation of Elizabethan times, some interesting speculation of historical figures, and some fictional personages as well. So, don't listen to the opinions of some uneducated guy, listen to somebody that KNOWS. Go and BUY this movie, have a little patience at the beginning, 'cause after that, you'll be sure to want to see ""Yellowbeard,"" ""Parrot Sketch Not Included: Twenty Years of Monty Python,"" ""Monty Python's Secret Policeman's Ball,"" and Nathan Lane's (Cliff Marlowe)""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" and ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail in Lego.""<br/><br/>There is only one thing I have seen that John Cleese was in that I liked more, ""Starballz."""

He suffers from writers block and is looking for a new muse. He founds his muse in the daughter of a rich merchant, who's about to marry Lord Wessex. His relationship with her inspires him to write the play, renames it and one of his most famous plays is born: ""Romeo & Juliette"" <br/><br/>The acting is really great and the sets are beautiful and I guess also historically accurate.

The script is a work of art - a contemporaneous rendition of the fulsome spirit of Shakespeare, with wit and a vast array of literate allusions to please all but the stodgiest of academics.

(**SPOILER**)  in the movie, the play to be acted out is romeo and juliet. the story is known all over.  but didnt it seem that romeo was will and juliet was paltrow?  i felt that their love had to be snuck around, and juliet was connected to royalty... it made me think of why he wrote romeo and juilet.  maybe it did connect to his experiences in love, and felt poisoned with the thought of having love in his heart, but yet his love was far away, never to be touched or seen forever.  shakespeare in love is the best movie that displays william shakespeare, and i strongly recommend it. To rent, or not to rent, that is the question?  but not rented is going to be such sweet sorrow.  (A A-)"

"BadWebDiver","10","2","4","2 May 2002"," Brilliant hypothetical historic story
","This is a absolutely fantastic story about the hypothetical rise of the playwright Will Shakespeare in Elizabethan England.<br/><br/>It reminds me of a comedy sketch I saw on an Australian high school English education tv program.. Francis Bacon visits Shakespeare in his cottage and asks what's he doing.  Shakespeare replies he's got this fantastic idea for a new show called The Shakespeare Follies.  ""It's got dancers, one ... no TWO swan boats, a full scale army, and the works.""  Bacon looks across to a table and sees a pile of manuscripts, and asks what they are.  ""Oh, they're some other plays I've been trying to put together.  They don't seem to be working that well.  One's about a Danish prince seeking revenge, another's about an old King having trouble with his daughters.  Another is about a Scottish monarch having encounters with witches.  Stuff like that.  But this, THIS is going to be my magnum opus.  I wonder if we can get some exotic animals on the stage, and two full armies, and ladies in pretty dresses on swings, and...""  Part of me would like to think Shakespeare may have been a LITTLE like this.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes handles the character excellently, seeming to give him some warmth and personality to what must have been a daunting role.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a lot of stature, poise and personality to her role as the female lead (this is significant in this story).  Commendations also to Ben Affleck, Rupert Everett, Martin Clunes, Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Colin Firth, and especially Geoffrey Rush for providing an excellent comic foil.<br/><br/>And congratulations should definitely go to the writers for putting together a snappy storyline with the material.  This is what creative talent can really do.<br/><br/>A top class piece of entertainment that thoroughly deserves all the plaudits it can get."
"Love2U","Null","2","4","28 March 2002"," Oscar Winner worthy of its renown
","Shakespeare in Love is one of those lushly photographed and exceptionally witty movies that are a rarity.  Too bad Shakespeare himself isn't around to see this one because even HE would probably find it quite amusing. Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly great.  In fact, she's never been better.  The plot is one of the most clever you will run across as a bold ""reconstruction"" of history.  It's not meant to be taken seriously, but is convincing enough as to pull off a very unlikely set of circumstances quite well."
"Captain Marmite","7","2","4","20 December 2001"," Much ado about nothing
","Stoppard's script is clever, but that's all. It enjoys its relative wit and dexterity, at the expense of character and empathy: Viola is really rather a dull girl, while the bard comes across like a lost cast member from Four Weddings and a Funeral, the bright-but-scatty Englishman required for American audiences. The one-liners are clangers, the wit is contrived and the pace is at times leaden.<br/><br/>The arrival of Rupert Everett on the scene seems to promise an injection of class into the film, but he is killed off, leaving the lightweight Fiennes to pout and ponder through the rest of the romantic comedy/sitcom plot.<br/><br/>The froth surrounding the film swept Paltrow to the Oscar, a travesty considering Cate Blanchett's monumental effort as the queen in 'Elizabeth'.<br/><br/>The final two minutes of the film were utterly stunning. I felt that Stoppard and his band of doting accolytes had been fired, or else possessed by a creative spirit straight from Will himself. Viola's stately walk up the beach of the strange new world was pure magic, turning the fluff the previous 100 minutes into ""sound and fury, signifying nothing."" A pity that this spirit could not infuse the rest of the film."
"Evil Tyrant","10","2","4","24 October 2001"," One of the best films
","Reading all the negative reviews of Shakespeare in Love makes me feel like a rebel for liking it, but a proud rebel I'll be then!  This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, and while it can be argued for not being historically accurate or overly sensual, or whatever it is some people are griping about, it is still a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are great as Will Shakespeare and Viola, and all of the supporting cast are terrifc as well, but the best part of the movie is the writing. The writing is smart, hilarious (especially if one has some knowledge of Shakespeare's works), and yes, even sensual.  But the story is of an affair between a bard and his muse, what do you expect? Leave your moral convictions and historical correctness aside, and just enjoy the movie for what it is: storytelling with a heart and a wicked sense of humor.<br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't have hurt if it was historically accurate to the least detail, but then that would take away some of the fun.  I have seen this movie more times than I can remember and it just gets better every time.  It's not for everybody (note: very young children in certain sections), but it's far from being a bad way to spend a few hours of your time.<br/><br/>Go see the movie! It may be a chick flick, but it's far better (and funnier) than any others that may be floating around.  My score: 10+"
"zetes","10","2","4","29 July 2000"," Overrated? Heck, it's terribly Underrated!
","I can't believe somebody could rent this movie and find it to be a bad film. I didn't see it until a day or two after it won Best Picture, but when I did, I smiled and affirmed that they had picked the best film of the year. A year, I will remind you, that in July it already seemed that Saving Private Ryan would certainly and very unfairly win itself the Best Picture award plus 10 more. The fact that so many people felt that Shakespeare in Love robbed SPR of its Oscars proves further just how sad this country is. People are extremely easily won over by cheap sentiment and commercials which tell us that SPR was ""deep."" SIL's Oscars were blamed on the Academy's forgetfulness.<br/><br/>Truth be told, that is exactly why SIL won and SPR lost. A film came along that impressed them late in the game, and that clinched the award. Plus, it was pushed up by Miramax's soft money campaign. Heck, if SIL didn't exist, Miramax would have tried its hardest to get Life is Beautiful that Best Picture Oscar. It would have even had a chance, a foreign film. No, if indeed SPR had come around in, say, October, it would have certainly won the Best Picture Oscar. Why? Well, look back to the 1998 awards show, where Titanic took everything and its mother. Very few people would affirm that Titanic was a worthwhile Best Picture. I don't know about you, but I was pretty embarassed to be an American after I aw Titanic (of course, afterwards, it swept the entire world, so I guess it's just our species). Titanic was sappy and obvious with its meanings and emotions, as was SPR. It would have won if not for their forgetfulness. Luckily, SIL conquered it.<br/><br/>Okay, the reason I like this film so much: it is extraordinarily well written and it has everything. Let's start with the everything notion right away: action, romance, comedy and drama. All of those are here in full force. It was perfect in all those aspects. Now, for the great writing, which many people are apparently missing:<br/><br/>to adapt a play as great as Romeo and Juliette and make it even more compelling than the original is a feat that almost no one can achieve. More compelling? Did I actually say that?!?!?!?! SACRILEGE! No, I truly believe that the play garners more meaning as we see it develop throughout SIL. We see Shakespeare's inspirations to write the play, we see him lovingly rehearse lines from the play with the woman whom he loves. Plus, in a developement so ingenious that it makes me clap, Viola, his love interest, is Romeo and Shakespeare is Juliette. It is just beautiful, and I have to give this movie a 10/10. It's terribly underrated, because I believe the idiots at the Academy, as well as a huge amount of cynical self-described film buffs have regretted its initial success. Some people will never know how good movies can get."
"Cathz","6","2","4","13 May 2000"," Good film, no masterpiece
","After the tremendous amount of hype, this film has no chance of living up to it.  Sure it's good, but it's not a masterpiece as critics would have you believe.<br/><br/>Still, there's no doubting that it has the finest of casts:  Joseph Fiennes, for instance, makes a perfect young Bard whatever some might say;  Judi Dench is magnificent in her cameo role;  Colin Firth is a dastardly bad guy; even Ben Affleck manages to fit in;  and many other familiar faces, such as Martin Clunes, Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, and Mark Williams from 'The Fast Show' provide the laughs (well, at least a smile.)<br/><br/>As for Gwyneth Paltrow - well, you can't deny that she gives an excellent performance, but compare it to Cate Blanchett's far more moving portrayal of 'Elizabeth', and I think you can safely say the Oscar was questionable.<br/><br/>Overall, it may baffle you as to why this film should be labelled a 'comedy' (in my opinion, there is just far too many sloppy love scenes), but for an enjoyable and superbly-made costume drama, it definitely deserves some of the praise it has won."

","How this movie beat out the likes of ""Life is Beautiful"" to win the Best Picture academy award is baffling.  It has its moments, but this thing is FAR too long.  45 minutes of this movie is continuous recitation of the characters' lines in the play.  ""Titanic"" was the most overrated movie of all time, but this is pretty close.  Gwyneth Paltrow was superb and may actually deserve her Best Actress award.  Rupert Everett (Christopher Marlowe) was fantastic as well and probably would have performed the role of Will much better than Fiennes' minimal attempt.  The scenery gets a good grade too, but there's nothing else in this movie that deserves a decent comment.  It may have deserved a Best Picture nomination because the year gave us such a poor collection of decent shows, but it definitely did not deserve to beat out ""Life is Beautiful"".  I give it a 6/10."
"Chuck-149","7","2","4","12 January 2000"," Way too over-rated.
","When this movie came out, I didn't think much of it.  I thought it was just some romantic comedy trying to do its best at the box-office.  But then it got those thirteen nominations at the Oscars and I started to believe it was pretty good and when I saw Paltrow got a nomination for best actress, I knew she would win.  However, I was surprised it beat Saving private Ryan for best picture.  Recently, I purchased the movie on DVD and was very disappointed by it.  I can't say that, besides Judi Dench who won her Oscar for best supporting actress, it deserved its Oscars for best picture and best actress.  It really didn't and Paltrow wasn't that stunning.<br/><br/>  The movie takes place in 1593.  There were two theatres at that time who were in big competition.  One of these was run by a man named Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush in a superb role).  Now at that period in time, women were not allowed to play in plays.  However, Viola De Lessips (Paltrow), the daughter of a rich man, is in love with plays, especially Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) plays.  She is so desperate to act in a play that she finally uses an alias, puts on a mustache, a wig and auditions for the part of Romeo in Shakespeare's new play, Romeo and Ethel which eventually turns out to be Romeo and Juliet.  But Viola has been engaged by her father to another rich man called Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) whom she doesn't love at all.  Naturally, she is in love with Shakespeare and the problems begin.<br/><br/>  Joseph Fiennes was over-looked at the Oscars.  I think that instead of giving Paltrow nomination and the Oscar, they should have given the nomination to Fiennes and the best actress Oscar to Cate Blanchett for her role in ""Elizabeth"".  One of the reasons Paltrow won is probably because she is naked quite often in the movie.  Of course this is a good movie, but it was definitely not the best picture of the year.  Proof is, it isn't the best 1998 movie on our top 250 films list.  Judi Dench's and Geoffrey Rush's performances are, however, exceptional.  So, once again, this is not a terrible movie but it is not the best movie of 1998 either."
"Spider-52","8","2","4","23 August 1999"," Good, but definitely not great.
","After finally watching ""Shakespeare in Love"", I find myself not understanding what all the fuss was about. Sure, the costuming is excellent and the acting is very good across the board, but there really isn't anything here to elevate it above the status of an enjoyable romantic comedy.<br/><br/>What really stops ""Shakespeare in Love"" from being a great film is the lack of a real climax.  The movie seems to be content with having a performance of Romeo and Juliet be its climax.  While it is an excellent stage production, it really doesn't provide any of the tension or emotion that is essential in this scene that the film has been building up to.  In fact, I found the entire movie to be lacking in this department; it doesn't involve the audience enough in what is happening.<br/><br/>It is because of this fact that one should not watch ""Shakespeare in Love"" with the intention of finding anything out of the ordinary.  When it comes right down to it, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is certainly not a great film, and most definitely not the best one of 1998.  It is, however, an entertaining and enjoyable romantic comedy that you won't want to pass up seeing."

","I'm not going to break this down like the last guy did on a profound literary level, I'm simply going to give you my reactions to this film which unfortunatly has been so over-hyped in my ears. When I rented it last night, I forced myself to block out all the ""It's a great film"" comments I've heard from family and friends and made an attempt to simply enjoy it as a film (despite the Oscars as well). When I sat down to watch it, I found only Hollywood's interpretation of a love story, dressed with Hollywood make-up, and Hollywood music, all of which blowing this story far out of proportion.<br/><br/>   Now don't get me wrong, Hollywood has produced many fine films, but Shakespeare in Love is simply too much of a motion-picture story, and not a real, story. It isn't a story that anyone can identify with on a personal level and that is what makes it hard to feel for the characters. It just so happens that I also saw the film ""October Sky"" yesterday, and although these two films can not be easily contrasted, October Sky tells a truly interesting story, without all the Hollywood dress-up. I'm not comparing these two, I'm simply saying that there are some good, simple stories out there, and then are large blow-out stories, solely aimed at winning the Oscar."
"larcher-2","6","2","4","31 July 1999"," An overrated, but charming, bit of fluff
","An overrated, but charming, bit of fluff; as is true in many minor movies, the atmospherics are better than the main plot.  One gets a real feel for what it was probably like in Elizabethan England to be an impecunious player.  The jokes are amusing, but much too arch; the story is the sort of thing that one expects from Harvard or Oxbridge undergraduates.  The minor characters are far better etched than the stars.  The few campy minutes of Queen Elizabeth are far better than the whole dull lump of the putative heroine."

But I don't see why it ranks so highly on IMDB or beat Saving Private Ryan (SPR) or Life is Beautiful (LiB) for best Oscar.  It was a nice period piece that makes fun of the world of theatre and Shakespeare, but I think 20 years from now SPR or LiB will be thought of as the true classics."
"Uncle B-2","7","2","4","5 April 1999"," The most overrated movie of 1998
","Shakespeare in Love is not a bad movie, but it is not a great one either. In fact, in most areas, this movie is amazingly mediocre to pretty good.  It is not particularly funny, not particularly well acted (with the exception of Judi Dench's incredibly small role, the rest of the performances are just adequately acted at best), not moving, not profound, and based on an adulterous affair between an engaged woman and a man who has left his wife and kids (something that is never romantic in real life, but somehow portrayed as such in the movies).  The one area that the film does excel is in its look.  This movie is beautiful to look at and brilliantly designed.<br/><br/>The real flaw in this movie lies in its central relationship between the young Will Shakespeare and his mistress Viola.  There is nothing to there relationship.  It's shallow.  Great movies cause you to make realizations about love that you always somehow knew or never quite figured out.  There are no realizations to be made in this movie.  Why are these characters even in love?  It's really hard to tell.  I think it's because they are both so beautiful and really know how to tell each other that.  That's fine.  Not every movie has to be profound or meaningful, but the great one's are. Shakespeare in Love is not great.<br/><br/>The most surprising thing for me was the lack of real humor in this movie. Tom Stoppard is truly one of the greatest living playwrights with a gift for comedy and a personal favorite of mine.  This script (which he co-wrote), however, is amusing at times, clever often, but rarely funny.  I guess I expect too much.  If you see this movie, enjoy it for what it is - beautiful eyecandy with a clever but fluffy storyline.  If you don't see it, don't worry.  (7 stars)"

When Shakespeare thought that he was responsible for the death of Christopher Marlowe, the movie seemed to lose its lightness, which is the film's greatest strength.  While it served its concept very well and it was well acted by all, especially Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, the movie just forgot too often that it was a clever, occasionally brilliant comedy.

","This much-maligned best picture winner really turned out to be quite good. I mean, there's no doubt there were many films in 1998 that were more worthy to win the award than this, but this by no means should have made people prejudiced against this film.<br/><br/>Anyway, what really strikes me about this film is how it brilliantly and wittily retold Romeo and Juliet within the story of the film, blending the play with an original fictional story that Shakespeare, as it's obvious, is its protagonist. The more the plot unravelled, the more impressed by the genius of the script I became. Moreover, there's a sustained self-awareness here which actually comes from being self-referential: the farcical approach to produce laughter; how the plot's structure feels, in a good way, ""staged""; and so on.<br/><br/>However, I can't say that this film worked for me as a ""romance"" film at all. Oddly, the film feels soulless in this aspect in particular. I believe I felt emotional every time lines from the play were narrated more than any time there was a ""romantic"" scene. Also, as much as I really loved the humour in this film as I mentioned above, I think it made the tone slightly uneven when we look at the whole picture. I think this could've been easily avoided by setting an ominous atmosphere early on like the play itself. If anyone doubts this could work in a film as it works in a play, I would say Cameron's Titanic is a sufficient proof this could work, and also pretty well.<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","Shakespeare in Love is a great movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.I had this recorded for quite some time but I was reluctant to watch it,although I was aware it was a Best Picture winner,I thought you would have to be seriously interested in William Shakespeare to enjoy this movie,and that it would require some knowledge of the way they spoke back then,but it really didn't,the story is easy to follow,we get to learn enough about Shakespeare before we get to the main plot,without giving us too much knowledge,and the way the characters speak is easy for a general audience to understand while still being as fashioned old as it can possibly be.The chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes was absolutely incredible and without a doubt the movies highlight,the lines they deliver to each other is very passionate and intense,something many actors would get shy and awkward about,but the two of them deliver these lines in pure confidence without any hesitation,and Paltrow definitely deserved the Academy Award for her performance.An interesting tale and some very inspired performances,I would recommend Shakespeare in Love to anyone looking for a good drama or romance. <br/><br/>William Shakespeare is struggling with writers block before a woman disguised as an actor becomes his muse.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Gwyneth Paltrow"

","I am a huge Shakespeare fan, so I found this movie very captivating and well-done. This had everything a movie should have to high degrees. That is why it won so many awards. Thing is, as much as other say, this is not 1998's best movie. Like others, I agree that Saving Private Ryan is the best. But my personal favourite is American History X, as it has the best acting and I have a deep personal connection with it. But SIL is a better piece of film than AHX. If I'm not mistaken, Shakespeare In Love is mostly fictitious. So the script writers came up with their own dialogue in Elizabethan language. Do you know how hard Elizabethan language is to comprehend and write? The movie being Elizabethan impressed the heck out of me. The whole movie isn't Elizabethan, but the parts that are, I am proud of. The sets and costumes are breathtaking and the acting is very good too. The whole style covers up an ordinary love story: William Shakespeare is writing Romeo & Juliet and falls in love with wannabe female actor pretending to be a boy. They fall madly in love, and it helps him with the story and with future plays. But there's rivals and feuds that get in the way. Sounds dull and unoriginal? Well, it's not Truman Show or Life Is Beautiful, but the script, music, acting, sets, and subplots are enough to make this movie very lovable. Sure it has its dumb moments, but not enough to ruin a perfectly fine movie. <br/><br/>I must say this again. Shakespeare In Love has everything a movie should have."

Its surprising to think that the film was for some years had been stuck in development hell. Some years earlier it was marked out to be a Kenneth Branagh/Juliet Roberts project.

This second part is not his soul but his dreams, his physical requirement, and his natural lust, which can be anything usually like beauty, power, respect etc. This 'portrayal' or the depiction of situation when two finds their desire and what goes on with their emotions is extremely nice, sensual, beautiful, and lustfully shown. The lack of control, flowing away and oozing emotions, lust all are just great in this movie. Other then this portrayal of emotions, there is nothing else in this movie to watch. Some good actors have acted so foolishly and even some got Oscar nominations. I have no idea of this but the idea and concept laid in the movie is extra ordinary and special, it is not important but it is different.<br/><br/>The biggest conclusion that this movie unintentionally points to is that the ultimate Freedom and ultimate Fulfilment provides Capability of any kind and immense Happiness.

","I love the movie Shakespeare in Love on more levels than i can explain. That said, this movie is not for everyone. I happen to like Shakespeare, history, romance, love, tragedy, and theater. The movie twines all of the old Shakespearean themes together, yet takes the characters on such original and surprising journeys. I love most that the ending is not cliché, but in some ways bitter, looking towards the reality of life for these characters. <br/><br/>It is playful, clever, and most likely to work for those who know Shakespeare's writings fairly well. If you don't, you will have a romantic period drama, which is original and different but you will miss the ""in"" jokes.

","I've honestly degraded the movie directly after knowing that Gwyneth Paltrow will be playing a major role namely Viola's, but surprisingly I was really amused by her qualifications in acting which arose at once. What I also mean by this is the fact that she's American yet she managed to speak the British accent both professionally and fluently, which is a win for the movie and her. Along with Joseph Fiennes the young handsome version of Shakespeare, they both managed to create a passionate romantic atmosphere which has left a memorable print in our touched hearts. Taking the plot into consideration, I would say that it was so beautifully made that I have finally known what life was like back then in England. It reflected Renaissance by it's simplest detail, speaking about the music, the costumes, the literature and the architecture as well. However it also provided an overview about the historic plot, namely the Elizabethan age and the imperialism. John Madden has really achieved a great accomplishment by portraying the parallels between the fictional play and the film, thus it was interesting spotting these out like for example the unwanted live, and the tragedies and also by directing a movie which is based on the author rather than his work, hence it was such an epic change taking the Shakespearean literature into consideration which are more like an everlasting play which lacks the entertainment and the sense of humour. Summing up, the movie is absolutely worth the seven Oscars it has won, for nothing happens for no reason."

","This majestic, romantic movie imagines the inspiration and events surrounding the writing of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare in love begins with a mid-career Shakespeare struggling with writer's block to create his new masterpiece. This film also paints a stunning portrait of life and theater in the Elizabethan era. The film's opening scene provides a striking image of the business of theater. For example the buildings, the budget, the script deadlines and the casting process. Not to mention the solid acting: All the actors embrace their characters, from the ink-stained fingers of Joseph Fiennes' Shakespeare, to the bold eyes of Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola. Joseph Fiennes is simply as mesmerizing as Shakespeare. However, the true phenomenon of the film is Gwyneth Paltrow. For she makes it perfectly believable that a character like hers could inspire one of the most inspired poets of all time. In addition, there's also the light sense of humor. Like Shakespeare's coffee mug ""Souvenir of Stratford-Upon-Avon"", or the priest cursing ""Plague on both your houses"" in the beginning of the movie. Either way, you can't miss a movie that speaks the language of love with such delight."

Nevertheless, the girl Shakespeare falls in love with -in my opinion-did not do her role that well. The movie itself was well produced, as it was a combination of romance and comedy. Not only was I informed about Shakespeare, but also about the Elizabethan time. IT made us laugh and get sometimes emotional. The actor ,who did Shakespeare's role was pretty good, but it would have been much better, if it was Ben Affleck taking this role instead.

","""Shakespeare in Love"" is one of the rare romantic comedies that I actually enjoyed. If the film is as good as ""Shakespeare in Love"", then there's not a lot to criticize, just good things to point out. Shakespeare in Love is a perfect mix of different genres: a romance, a comedy and a drama. It all works out to make it one of the best films. Like the couple Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare and Viola are separated by a huge cap. They, however, manage to get to know each other. Shakespeare soon learns Viola and they carry on with their love affair until events that test their relationship come to a head. The performances are all excellent and the use of Shakespearean dialog is done quite well and doesn't seem forced at all. I actually have loves watching the movie, since ""Shakespeare in Love"" is really my cup of tea. If I write anymore about ""Shakespeare in Love"", I risk drooling all over the review.

","A modern day wake up call as to why London's theater actors are so much in demand in Beverly Hills when it comes to making movies portraying medieval characters and societal values back then. Be it the Victorian era of life or starting right from the dark ages proceeding towards the Crusades and henceforth to the medieval renaissance period, there are very few actors who can carry off with poise the pedantic mannerisms and speech modulations which characters across all stratas of society used to exhibit. This motion picture is star studded if you may, with Gwyneth Paltrow playing the love interest of the protagonist called William Shakespeare played by Joseph Fiennes. The reason I call this star studded is because the cast consists of rigorously trained actors who have done theater for numerous number of years and are most adept at handling this play kind of movie with poetic justice. Here, Shakespeare is given a satirical image with incidents connected to his life being fabricated and his character in itself being a figment of one's imagination. He is vividly portrayed as a river ""bankside"" poet who has had the audacity to fall in love with Viola de Lesseps(Paltrow), a higher class woman who was to be married off to Lord Wessex(Firth) an upper class nobility, under the direction of the Queen herself, played by Judi Dench. <br/><br/>The extravaganza starts in London set at 1593, where in the glory days of Elizabethan theater only two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and audiences. One was the famous Curtain Theatre boasting London's most famous actor Richard Burbage, where across from the river(Thames), were giving them competition a theater overridden with cash flow problems and debts run by Philip Henslowe(Rush). The whole movie revolves around how Lady viola is passionate about stage acting but was debarred from doing so, being a lady. In those days acting was considered to be a disrespectful profession and hence women were not allowed to act. She meets Will at a gathering and they both become smitten by each other's charm. The lady falls for Will because of his skills extraordinaire, the beauty of recitals in his plays. She even disguises herself as a boy to play the role of Mr. Kent in one of Will's plays, Romeo & Juliet being organised by the Henslowe theater. But in the mix of events a suspicious and misconstruing Wessex tries to assassinate William. That Viola is secretly going to rehearsals on top of having an illicit affair is also discovered by them, and she is barred from doing so and Henslowe's theater is shut down on ultimatum from the Queen. She is forced to come to the New World by Wessex to his plantations in Virginia. But on the day of the event Viola escapes and arrives at the place where the play ""Romeo & Juliet"" is now being staged by the Curtain Theatre. In the pandemonium that ensues, it turns out that in the end Will takes up the role of Romeo and Viola that of Juliet, and together they produce a heart rending spectacle, reducing the crowd to tears, the crowd which includes The Queen itself, the royal patron. All is forgiven and the movie ends in a tearful separation between the souls amidst poetry rendered in suspended animation."

","Shakespeare in Love is the film i adore the most and beyond countable measure. It is the single most enchanting, mesmerizing, poignant, passionate, breathtaking and awe inspiring film i have ever had the pleasure to see. I thank the person who suggested it all those years back for it is beauty personified. It's ingenuity and craftsmanship is beyond compare. It is the foremost representative reason of why people make movies and that is to tell stories. Not to tell run of the mill stories as 90% tend to be but instead to bewitch the audience with the most soulful, visionary, extraordinary and one of a kind stories. All those words pale in comparison to the glimmering light that is Shakespeare in Love and just like its heroine it is unbiddable, ungovernable passion. A riot of the heart.<br/><br/>The screenplay is inspiring, awe inspiring and then some. The creative genius, the artistry of it all is the fine definition of captivating. What ingenuity, what splendor, what originality and what celebration of passion and love. A true alluring gem to behold. It is a play within a play celebrating the works of the master playwright himself and most of all celebrating passion of yore. A tale of inspirational love that drives a man to create pure poetry in her name for she is the light and the sun.<br/><br/>This is by no means a common man's movie. It is commemoration of artistry, of playwriting and the celebration of language and its beauty, the sheer poetry of words. A true reverence of the works of Shakespeare, a marvelous homage to the lasting legacy of his works of art, for his plays are masterpieces, and to the mark of true romance and emotion they have left on so many lives. Everything from The Two Gentlemen of Verona to Macbeth, Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice to The Tempest are ingeniously referenced in the movie but most importantly of all the two most celebrated plays in the film are The Twelfth Night and Romeo and Juliet. The passionate scene of pure soul combining love where Shakespeare and his beloved Viola recite the powerful lines of Romeo and Juliet is the most entrancing, most hypnotizing, most beautiful scene i have witnessed in cinema. Those who have read and know the lines of Shakespeare's works will see how ingeniously they have been incorporated into the film. The passion and spellbinding beauty of the words are given even more powerful and heart stopping meaning for their origin as seen in the movie is a place of true enchantment. The magnitude of the words is intensified when spoken between Viola and William. Every word in his Romeo and Juliet comes from their story, the story of Viola and William and the depth amplified a thousand fold as a result. His words were how he captured his feelings on their sweeping passionate romance.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow is the most shimmering, the most priceless jewel in the treasure trove of magnificence we call Shakespeare in Love. She not only exudes pure radiance but she is its definition. Her incandescent glow and splendor, the unbridled spirit and vivaciousness, the vividness she brings to the breathtaking Viola de Lesseps is a thing to behold. Viola de Lesseps is passion and passion is her. She is the essence, the soul of this story for she is not only Viola but also Juliet and Romeo and Thomas Kent and every Shakespearean heroine. In a tale of a poignant fictional and fervent romance she is the muse, the gloriously triumphant muse of William Shakespeare. The inspiration of art, true art, the art we call literature and poetry. She breathes life into a man's life and is a revelation to a man without inspiration, without creative influence and she brings something into his life that he himself is shaken to the core by, true love. Her passion for life, for love and for literature and poetry cement her as the most captivating heroine i have seen on the silver screen. I was left in pure awe and even teared up for she is emotions of the most powerful caliber.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are marvelous but it is Joseph Fiennes who takes excellence to another level and imbues life and soul into his character and creates a hero so lovable and one of a kind that you will be hanging on his every uttered line. The passion in William's eyes for Viola is so evident and in hers for him. Truly swoon worthy, explosive and breathtaking.<br/><br/>Judi Dench and Ben Affleck are hilarious. The humor of the film is charming, intelligent and relies on wit more than anything else. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Martin Clunes, Imelda Staunton, Rupert Everett and Mark Williams are simply wonderful as are the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The score is spectacular that is keeps you excited through this entire grand experience perfectly complimenting each each emotion, each scene it accompanies. It is so beautiful and evokes such grandeur. It can leave you in tears.<br/><br/>And that ending, what beauty and heart. Their parting words 'You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die' 'Nor you for me' were so startling and powerful. And when she tells him of how their love was the most greatest thing to her and she would have it no other way, WOW! Their confessions of true love and the ending where her courage, spirit and strength ensure a new beginning brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>This film is the best Shakespearean play that Shakespeare never wrote. It has all the elements one usually finds in his plays such as disguises, mistaken identities, romance and sword fights. A film for any intelligent person who appreciates the language and literature.<br/><br/>It won many Academy Awards and it deserved each and everyone especially for Gwyneth as Best Actress and for Best Picture and still deserved more."

","I have been meaning to see this movie for a long time, and in fact at my video store, it is still on the over-night listings, but it is stuck in a corner where all of the older overnighters are kept. I guess I started putting it off when all of the hype over the awards that it won came out, but in my opinion, this is one of the few movies that deserved the awards that it won.<br/><br/>Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block, and the owner of the theatre that his plays are performed in owes a lot of money and is being forced to pay up. He gets some inspiration from an apocrather, but looses it again when he discovers that the woman he is having an affair with is having an affair with another man. So he loses his inspiration again, only to get it back when he falls in love with a noble lady who, unfortunately for her, is being married to a complete thug.<br/><br/>This movie is accurate in the traditions of the Elizabethan theatre where men were the only ones allowed to act, and in fact there was a preacher out the front of the theatre denouncing the evils of the theatre (such as now we have fundamentalists denouncing the evils of roleplaying). In fact, the woman to whom Shakespeare is in love with, wishes so much to act on the stage, that she disguises herself as a man and takes the role of Romeo, but when the deceit is uncovered, the theatre is shut down for debauchery.<br/><br/>Judi Dench plays Queen Elizabeth, and only was on screen for no more than fifteen minutes, yet pulled such a stunning and realistic performance that she won an Oscar for it (not that it really means anything to me). Tom Stoppard also wrote the screenplay, which gives the film much more credibility, especially since Stoppard is not only a brilliant playwright, but he knows his Shakespeare. In fact, in this movie we see ideas borrowed from other Shakespeare plays, such as women disguising themselves as men, character names, and of course a similar theme to that of Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>The play that Shakespeare ends up writing is Romeo and Juliet, though the name begins as Romeo and Ethal the Pirate King's Daughter. The play is performed at the end, and in fact I found that the bits of performance that we see in this movies is a thousand times better than the performance that we see in the movie Baz Luhrman's version. In fact, that is how I judge a Shakespeare movie, namely how powerful the acting comes out, and personally, Leonardo diCaprio's performance was nowhere near as good as the performance here."

","Shakespeare in Love is a film that you can see and feel the brilliance at the very start of the picture and it enchants you to a state of delight. The screenplay is the picture. It's an ideal screenplay that is unexpected to be so enthralling and clever. The film celebrates Shakespeare's life, explores his greatest writing achievements, most obviously being Romeo & Juliet, but other iconic pieces get a few homages. Fiction life imitates art so wonderfully, you could fool a naive man with a claim this was a fact-by-fact biography. Any theater/English influenced person could easily wish this story the way it all actually happened. It uses real-life fact to build the fiction, and it's still a hilarious, romantic movie to watch.<br/><br/>Mirroring Romeo & Juliet for most of the film, Shakespeare in Love gets to explore ironies of social issues at the time and the ""truth and nature of love"". This film sets an example to non- artists, an artist's inspiration for their work. One of the easiest routes for producing wonderful writing, music, or paintings is love. Shakespeare in Love is one of the few romantic films that actually is completely successful in capturing love. Some say, you must go back to Shakespeare's original works to acquire great acting or truth in theater or entertainment, and Shakespeare in Love does successfully allow the lead couple act out Romeo & Juliet, but it also sets a precedent that all you need is good writing making romance and narrative just as tantalizing as the classics. A good deal of fun can be had by the audience watching Shakespeare in Love, it's also contains moments of hilarious comedy. But Shakespeare, Romeo & Juliet, and this movie prove Judi Dench's character, Queen Elizabeth, wrong on love, who claim that true love can never be captured in the theater.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow dazzle in the depth of their strong characters and passionate romance. Paltrow has such powerful charm and lovability behind Viola and Fiennes creates a great depiction of the most popular scribe in history. Judi Dench's cameo is a wonderful addition. The costumes are a degree above other period piece's clothing design, enriched in creativity and elegance. The sets and cinematography are beautiful, the editing breaks down the wall of the viewer's imagination, and its underlined with a romantically epic musical score. The director, John Madden, makes all the risky components of a film with so many intricacies into a sweeping masterpiece, that's hard to sit through without smiling and even harder to leave with tears.

Extremely witty screenplay and portrayals of well known figures of the period. Though Gwyneth Paltrow won an Oscar and is certainly good in the film--it's not as if you couldn't imagine someone else being quite good in the role - -although I must say most of the names bandied about wouldn't have been better.

"gelman@attglobal.net","10","0","0","30 December 2012"," The Idea Is the Biggest Winner
","""Shakespeare in Love"" is one of the more decorated films in recent years. Two of its Oscars went to leading lady Gwyneth Paltrow as Shakespeare's love interest, the other in the supporting actress category to Judi Dench for a relatively brief on-screen appearance as Queen Elizabeth. The Motion Picture Academy doesn't give Oscars for conceiving the basic idea of a film, and I don't know if the idea came from screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, who got their Oscars, or possibly from director John Madden, who didn't. But what makes this film unique is its underlying concept: Shakespeare's finding of the beautiful muse who inspires Romeo and Juliet. Suspicion falls naturally on Tom Stoppard. His writerly DNA includes an earlier play, ""Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead,"" which mingled scenes from Hamlet with plot and dialog focused on two minor characters in Shakespeare's play. In this film, Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block, a common enough problem to be credible even when the author is the prolific Bard of Avon. Ms. Paltrow's character is a young woman disguised as a male because she's obsessed with the theater, and women aren't allowed on stage during the Elizabethan era. The affair between them releases Shakespeare's paralyzed imagination.. Joseph Fiennes is very good as the young Shakespeare, though he didn't win many awards, Paltrow is outstanding as Shakespeare's girl friend/muse, and in addition to Dame Judi, Geoffrey Rush also turns in a fine performance as a rival playwright. But it is again the mingling of Shakespeare's words and plot with the dialog written by Norman and Stoppard that transforms this romance into a wondrous film. I don't know what Mr. Norman contributed but Stoppard is a well-known word magician, whose plays are possibly the most intellectual, inventive and funny body of work since the days of George Bernard Shaw. If I'm giving Stoppard more credit than he deserves, I apologize. In any event, Shakespeare in Love is work of genius in addition to being a lovely, watchable romantic comedy."

And the uniting thread is the plot of Romeo and Juliet known to everyone. <br/><br/>The director and the actors did wonderful job to deliver a perfect timing in many those hilarious moments created by those dualities.<br/><br/>The movie is delightfully fast-paced (a lot of running, and even fightingâ€”on or off the stage), and potently lean (no excessive dialogues or unnecessary scenes).

The story focuses on the legendary playwright and legendary stage director William Shakespeare on his quest in search for inspiration to find a potential muse that would eventually lead to one of his best written plays of all time, ""Romeo and Juliet"". It takes you the events and tragedies that inspired him to write this endearing tragedy that has to this very day being one of the greatest plays ever written. Legenday playwright Mark Norman and Tom Stoppard mentioned in the DVD features that they were always curious of what kind of a person William Shakespeare was like before he reached the iconic level.<br/><br/>Although nobody really has an accurate portrayal of the man, we are led to assume that he was no different than anybody else who was entering in the field of writing. ""Shakespeare in Love"" gives its audience the assumption that he was poorer than dirt, hungry for sex and most of all struggling to fit that final sentence into proper grammar. The historical account was very well in terms of accuracy as we get the feeling that we have stepped into the metaphoric time machine during the Elizabethan time period in England. We get the feel of the customs, the laws, the clothes and the mannerisms that the civilians of that generation lived. The DVD extras provide you with a lot of depth on what to expect in this provocative period piece.<br/><br/>The one thing that short changed me a little bit was the lack of mentioning of the name Christopher Marlowe. For those who don't know who Mr. Marlowe, he was Shakespeare's apprentice who many also went as far to believe that he was Shakespeare's ghost writer. His life ended tragically when a tavern brawl ensued and he was beaten to death at the young age of 29. But the execution delivered here was handled so convincingly, it puts our skepticism to rest. Sure the lustful scenes at the beginning will surely fog up your lenses, but then again there are steamy romantic interludes in ""Romeo and Juliet"" so this should come as no surprise.<br/><br/>The cast features an elaborate ensemble of talented performers to make this film more real and very captivating. The leads and supports all turned in sublime performances I'm not really sure which one stood out the most. Joseph Fiennes was excellent in the titular character He is the definitive Lothario who's light on his triumphs and failures. Gwyneth Paltrow was the right ingredient for the perfect muse for what would lead to the greatest and saddest tragedies to ever hit the center stage. Paltrow herself was probably the inspiration that Norman and Stoppard needed to create their modern day masterpiece. Colin Firth shines as the manipulative, conniving villain Lord Wessex and Ben Affleck was at the top of his game as the suave thespian Ned Alleyn.<br/><br/>Alleyn doesn't come up on the acting spectrum on his own. He has a slew of other fine thespians all vying for their big break. In the beginning of the movie, the film has a soft and gentle feeling to it. In the second half, we see a more tragic and a more involving storyline as the film goes into progression. Dame Judy Dench feels right at home in the period piece genre as her majesty Queen Elizabeth I. Her costumes are so punctual to the period it feels like they should be exhibited at the Smithsonian itself. The costumes were just one of seven Oscar nominations this movie received. Other notables include Best Screenplay (Norman and Stoppard), Best Actress (Gwyneth Paltrow), Best Supporting Actress (Dench) and three others. If you never seen it before I advise you to watch this movie. You will not be disappointed."

","Don't be afraid of the word Shakespeare in the title! This movie is not a junior-high history lesson. It's light, funny, romantic, and a totally irreverent look at Elizabethan England. The idea is that Shakespeare is not some grave, great poet, but a young guy trying to make his way in the theatre. He's written good plays, but nothing truly transcendent. The conceit is that an ill-fated romance--the one great true love of this life--with a beautiful, smart woman is what inspires him to write his first immortal play: Romeo and Juliet. The film never plods. The screenplay is rich with romance, emotion and action. The plot weaves several stories and themes. You can enjoy it as a simple love story with some action and basic suspense about producing a play or you can get much deeper into movie's complex tapestry of ideas and in jokes. But most importantly the film's mood is always light and is never overblown."

","Even though this movie was ficitonalize, it did take you back in the 16th century England and recall what those times were. It made you think about the customs and rituals of that time and that women mostly were oppressed. Moreover, arranged marriage and other life's goals were set out and was decided for a person. OK Shakespare had a writers block, but the story is not there, nor is it the play Romeo and Juliet, that was not the theme of the story, it was just merely a part of the story. The real part of the story, as the title suggests, Shakespeare is in love. His love takes him to a place in his life that he has not experienced, well for a long time at least, she becomes why he wants to write and the very reason for his survival, and isn't' that what we want in life. Someone to love and someone to care about, whether it was 400 years ago or now??"

","I haven't personally read every one of his plays, but I know enough about them to ""get"" this. It's a clever mix of ideas and references from numerous of the famous ones, and actually an original idea that combines(and does so well) what it borrows from Shakespeare himself. While I haven't seen anything else directed by Madden, I can imagine doing so, because he certainly handles this well. I wasn't personally into the comedy of this, too silly for my tastes, though I'm sure that there is an audience for it. The plot is well-done, and develops nicely throughout. This has fine pacing. The acting is all rather great, every performance is spot-on. This maintains a lot of the (wordy) type of dialog of the time that it presents, if also updated somewhat to fit contemporary tastes. The cast is all well-chosen. There is sexuality(so much so that it gained an R rating) and near nudity in this, and that is about it for objectionable material. This is interesting and has some surprises, and is worth the time for any fan of the famed playwright's work. I recommend it to anyone who considers themselves that, and advise any more casual viewer to bring along a friend who is more of an expert on the subject than they are, so that they can get as much out of watching this as possible. 8/10"

","Here's the thing. I really enjoyed ""Shakespeare in Love."" I am a fan of Shakespeare's works, and even though I know this film is not the least bit historically accurate, I was still fascinated by this concept that Shakespeare's plays could have been inspired by a secret romance such as the one in the film. I loved watching how much his play ""Romeo and Juliet"" changed throughout the film and his romance evolved the play until it became the one we all know and love. There are great performances in this film, including a best actress Oscar for Gwenyth Palthrow. For me, the most noteworthy performance is Judi Dench, an absolutely flawless and funny performance as the Queen, for which she won a much-deserved supporting actress Academy Award. I do have a few small problems with this film. First, there are a few parts in the movie that come off a bit cheesy to me, such as Shakespeare pretending to be the maid by covering his head with a sheet. Also, what about a man dressed as a woman being mistaken for the woman pretending to be a man? I don't know. It seemed cheesy to me. With things like that in the film, it doesn't seem right that the film should win Best Picture, especially when it was up against two nearly perfect nominees, ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Life is Beautiful."" All in all, a fun and fascinating film, but not perfect. Had it not won Best Picture, I probably would not critique it so much, but despite that, I recommend it, especially to those interested in Shakespeare.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","This was a film I initially disliked but came around after my second viewing. It still has some problems but I can see why some love it so much. The script is intricate and packed with visual and verbal clues on Elizabethan England. The actors all seem to be enjoying themselves. Joseph Fiennes is a well-cast Shakespeare. Gwyneth Paltrow looks beautiful but I'm not convinced she deserved her Oscar. Geoffery Rush and Tom Wilkinson are old pros who slip into their comic roles comfortably. Judi Dench is solid as always. No one does a bad job. The last one third is devoted to a stage recreation of Romeo and Juliet and drags a bit.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"
"ghostflash","9","0","0","18 January 2009"," Delightful speculation on Shakespeare's life
","John Madden has made the historical adaptation his own with Mrs. Brown, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. He knows that it's detail that matters in period dramas. In this delightful speculation on Shakespeare's life fans of the bard will enjoy the comic references such as his constant practising of his signature and his rivalry with Christopher Marlowe. Joseph Fiennes is cast as a very cool, unbuttoned shirted Shakespeare and his romance with Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola is convincing and beautiful. In fact, the casting is one of the best things about this film. So many great British actors such as Colin Firth, Simon Callow, Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson and Rupert Everett bring charm and grace to the picture. Comic turns from Martin Clunes, Simon Day and Mark Williams keep the film's tone comical but not distracting from the serious themes. The comic tone of the film is important because one must remember none of this actually happened. It's all a speculation based on certain facts. The encounter between Shakespeare and Marlowe is particularly enjoyable,similar to Chaucer appearing in A Knight's Tale. It comments on their, perhaps friendly, rivalry and overflows with nods to the audience. Although there are a few inaccuracies such as Shakespeare's muse being a woman (it is clear from his sonnets that most of them were written for a man. Maybe a film about Shakespeare's male romances would be more interesting considering that homosexuality was even more of a taboo back then) most of them are comic and done on purpose. This comical aspect stops people criticising the film for being overly misleading and fictitious. Shakespeare in Love is supposed to be an emotional yet lighthearted movie-going experience. Although there are purposeful comic inaccuracies the detail is another fascinating thing about this film. From the muddy streets and falling excrement to The Rose theatre, the authentication is astounding. The theatre really looks like the Globe in London, maybe it is. The costumes and other sets are also very realistic; you can just feel the tightness of the corsets and the softness and tangibility of the costumes. It shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar but its these beautifully detailed sets and costumes which secured it. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard even make the script authentically Shakespearean with the gender confusion, exploration of love and the somewhat tragic aspects later in the film. Shakespeare in Love is an astoundingly beautiful and detailed work with such great acting talent and amusing script that it will keep audiences dazzled and delighted for years to come."
"marlyly","6","0","0","4 October 2008"," Primarily a Love Story - The Shakespeare Thing is Just an Extra
","I guess the biggest fault you can find in this film is that the story of E.T. is more likely to have been true than the love affair portrayed in 'Shakespeare in Love'. But as the film never once claims to be historically accurate, then I can't really complain about this and instead will take the film for what it is - a love story with a twist! The story goes that William Shakespeare is having writer's block and needs inspiration to help write his next play (which will end up being Romeo & Juliet). While watching the auditions for the part of Romeo, Shakespeare is dazzled by the talent of one boy - who turns out to actually be the beautiful Viola De Lesseps who has auditioned under the disguise of a man as women were not allowed to be actors in Shakespeare's day. Here starts the love story between William and Viola, finally giving Shakespeare the inspiration he needs to write Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>The script is full of jokes and references that people who have studied Shakespeare will appreciate, but there's also plenty for the non-fans too to keep you occupied. Jospeh Fiennes did an OK job as Shakespeare but he was over-shadowed by not only Gwyneth Paltrow as Viola (I've never been a fan of Shakepeare but when she read his poems and speeches I fully understood the meaning of his words), and especially by Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth. What I especially liked was the ending to the story, which was not what I had expected to finally happen (but I guess, is more true to Shakespeare's life).<br/><br/>A good film, but not great. I look forward to watching it again."

"dead47548","10","0","0","10 May 2008"," One of the best I've seen in quite a while.
","A whimsical, hilarious, tragic story about a forbidden love between a then-common playwright and a beautiful woman with her wealth forcing her to wed another man. It's one of the most sharply written films I've ever seen, that completely draws you in from the first moment where we see Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) order his men to chop off Philip Henslowe's (Geoffrey Rush) nose and ear to the very end as Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) walk up the beach.<br/><br/>The film centers around the young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) who is desperately trying to sell his work in order to keep on living. As him and theater owner Henslowe are auditioning for the lead in his new play, he meets a young boy whom he thinks is perfect for the part. The boy runs away after realizing that it's Shakespeare, and Will follows him to his home where he meets Viola (who he later finds out was disguised as the young boy due to her love of theater). And thus begins this beautiful romance between two lovers who are torn apart by status and society.<br/><br/>This story has it's share of hilarious moments mixed with absolutely tragic ones, but never manages to drag or stop being one of the most compelling pictures I've ever seen. I also really love all of the subtle references to rumors regarding Shakespeare and the allusions to his other plays that occur throughout the film. The performances are all glorious and the technical aspects (the costume design, set decoration and score in particular) are easily among the best of the decade. Surely a masterpiece which more than deserved it's Best Picture win."

","""shakespeare in love"" is, at its core, nothing more than a standard romance movie. furthermore, like most movies about artists or works of art, fictional or not, it suffers from trying to explain genius. but ""shakespeare in love"" is raised above mediocrity by all-around good performances and stunning costume design. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are adorable as star-crossed lovers, and they get fantastic support by the comical Geoffrey Rush and the dashingly handsome Ben Affleck. the best performance, though, comes from Judi Dench who has a short but delicious turn as queen Elizabeth. all in all, a better than average romance movie and a must see for fans of period costumes."
"teacherlogan","8","0","0","6 February 2008"," Art Imitates...Art? A new telling of a classic tale
","Purists may view Shakespeare In Love as a ridiculous fictionalization of a great writer's greatest work. They may not believe that Gwyneth Paltrow can pull off the role of a refined English lady and literary aficionado. They may sneer at Ben Affleck donning a British accent and attempting to portray Mercutio on stage. To focus on these and other minor inconsistencies is to miss the point of this film. Shakespeare In Love is a wonderful romantic comedy set against the back-drop of a historical event; the writing of Romeo and Juliet. We know the story of the star-crossed lovers so well. Still, Shakespeare In Love allows the audience to experience this classic play in a unique and fascinating new way.<br/><br/>William Shakespeare has written some of the most historic plays and beautiful poetry in literary history. However, as Shakespeare in Love opens, he is suffering from writer's block. Commissioned by a struggling playhouse to produce a great new work, he sets out to write a comedy about Romeo and Ethel. He is encouraged to throw in a bit with a dog, as that seems to strike a chord with the illiterate public.<br/><br/>As he struggles with new pages for his play, Shakespeare becomes enchanted by Viola, a proper English lady who secretly yearns for the stage. Disguised as a man, since women were forbidden to act, she auditions at the sorry playhouse and gains the lead role. Once her identity is revealed to Shakespeare, they begin a love affair. Despite Viola being bequeathed to another man, their affair continues and she becomes Shakespeare's muse for one of the greatest love stories of all time.<br/><br/>The cast of Shakespeare In Love is the very definition of ensemble. Joseph Fines, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth and Dame Judi Dench highlight the array of talented British actors lending their craft to this film. Rush, a brilliant dramatic actor, has an equally refined gift for comedy. Shakespeare In Love allows him to let loose, with witty dialog and perfect comedic delivery. Dench exemplifies the dignity of the period as Elizabeth I. Her portrayal is reserved, yet powerful. Though she may have few scenes, she commands every one. <br/><br/>However amongst the litany of English stars, as Viola, Gwyneth Paltrow is able to more than hold her own. There is no need to suspend disbelief regarding her role as an proper English maiden. Her passion and presence command the screen. As a central character of this film, Paltrow must be completely believable. The audience must believe that this 'American actor' is the embodiment of Shakespeare's Juliet. Through Paltrow's Oscar worthy performance, we can. <br/><br/>Much like James Cameron's Titanic, the audience knows the main story and ultimately how it will end. Romeo and Juliet is a timeless classic. The enchanting aspect of Shakespeare In Love is it fictionalizes the process by which a true piece of literature is produced. The movie tries to answer the question of what inspired Shakespeare to write a play that expresses the very nature of love. This film is an interpretation of from where that genius came.<br/><br/>So often we hear about authors writing about their own experiences. Why should Romeo and Juliet be any different? Aspects of Shakespeare and Viola's ""real life"" work their way into Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare's attendance at the royal ball early in the film, their love affair despite Viola being promised to another man, even her nurse maid's character find their way into his play. The play takes a dark turn into tragedy precisely at the moment when Shakespeare and Viola realize they cannot be together.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that Shakespeare in Love is ultimately a fictional romantic comedy. Being a piece of fiction, the film allows the writer and director's imagination to run wild. This film is the ultimate example of the moniker ""based on a true story"". Except the true story is itself a piece of fiction. Romeo and Juliet is one of the truest love stories in all of literature. It is a staple of the high school cannon and familiar to millions of people. Shakespeare In Love is a marvelous take on a classic story. Purists can rest assured that not one word of Romeo and Juliet has been altered or diluted. In fact, the timeless play has become the impetus by which another great work has been born. Using the medium of the 20th Century, Shakespeare In Love is a great cinematic work."

They are both extremely talented and credible when portraying their characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It's fun, yet it also touches upon many other emotions.

","LOVE presents a pretty conceit that has the author himself pining for his next true love as he prepares his latest play. The conceit is that many of Shakespeare's plays are quoted from or acted out in part in this expensive comedy-drama. And this happens right from the get-go when a character shouts ""A plague on both your houses!"" Any Shakespeare fan can tell you this is a line from ""Romeo and Juliet."" And ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the very play the married but lovelorn Will is composing during the course of this movie, a play that will end up transforming and transfixing everyone who comes into contact with it -- the same effect that happens to those seeing Picasso's ""Guernica"" or hearing Mozart's ""Requiem"" for the first time. Could this magical effect have happened in real life? Probably not, but it is a witty plot angle. The acting is excellent, the costuming is wonderful, the sets are very authentic in feel. But -- and this is a very big but -- LOVE is a chick flick. Real men are not welcome. Shakespeare himself (Joseph Fiennes) looks and often acts like a woman in disguise -- one of the movie's plot elements indeed focuses on gender confusion and identity swapping, which is also right out of ""Twelfth Night,"" another Shakespeare play. Claire Danes is wonderful as Shakespeare's latest muse, and the magnificent supporting cast is made up of many familiar faces, most of them British. Ben Affleck is the only other American in the cast, and he plays a small but critical role. In the end, all's well that ends well. But it does not change the nature of this film, which is for women only. Men, do not be fooled by the Oscars bestowed upon this film. As any right-thinking person knows, an Oscar means squat to most viewers these days."

","This movie asks this question: what if William Shakespeare had lived the life of Romeo during the writing of Romeo and Juliet? As Shakespeare falls for a girl high above his rank, pursues her in shadows and behind stage walls, and comes to blows with her noble suitor and the whole of England, the action of Shakespeare in Love and scenes of Romeo and Juliet weave in and out of each other with style and grace.<br/><br/>Stories such as these can usually be called contrived, and indeed might be called such here, but somehow, I just don't care. Maybe it's the artist in me, or maybe (and more probably) it's the acting, directing, and screen writing, but I couldn't help but be charmed, pulled in, and thoroughly affected by this wonderful film. At every turn the acting and writing managed to provide beautiful romance while sidestepping the dangers of being stilted and contrived as the two stories are made to coincide. The result is a natural, livable story that disarmed me and kept me with it dramatically. Paltrow's radiance and range pulled me in and I fell in love with her just as Shakespeare was. Fiennes's performance was just unassuming enough--then explosive!-- to make me let my guard down, empathize, fear, and hope with his character. The glorious ensemble cast, including the indomitable Judi Dench and the realistic and human Geoffrey Rush put the last nail in the coffin of any doubts. This movie was impeccably executed, and that freed me to enjoy it! Well done, crew. It's a writer's dream realized."

","This is one of the few movies that I have given a 10 of 10, maybe the only one. There is tremendous skill at work in every aspect of the film. And the passion... yes, the passion.<br/><br/>The script is simply amazing. The fabulous humour - written and visual - exists throughout. The depth of meaning and presentation of the various references means three things for me. First, that the writing was done for the pleasure of the writers as well as the audience. Second, the writers know what they're writing about (certainly I recognize Tom Stoppard's talent). Thirdly, my impression is that the screenwriters wrote the cleverness not to be seen to be clever but because it was such fun. Every multi-level reference that I could catch or, more to the point, those I didn't, left me feeling not that I was clever or daft myself (correspondingly) but that there was a richness to the material that could be appreciated at a variety of levels.<br/><br/>The devices used in the script, many more than I know but can nonetheless appreciate, such as intermixing a dialogue sequence between real-life and stage is used very effectively to show that there are parallel fictional stories being told. There is no suggestion from the writers that we are watching a true-to-life story. We know at the outset that it is a fiction loosely based at a certain point in the lives of real people. Perhaps in similar way that Shakespeare's works themselves are historical fiction in some cases (though I know little of Shakespeare).<br/><br/>There are particular moments of script brilliance where I found myself suspended in time and unable to breathe as if a river was suddenly dammed and subsequently released with tremendous emotion. For example, the stuttering start of the prologue to the play - absolutely fantastic. Foreshadowing is also used effectively if unsubtly at times as are the Shakespearean notions of mistaken identity and gender-bending.<br/><br/>Even such contrivances as Lord Wessex getting a paper flyer in the face just after his marriage to Viola are pulled off easily and believably.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant, cohesive and consistent - a magical combination of script, direction, casting and, oh yes, the actors abilities. The characters all gel into a single, 2 hour dance. How does a movie achieve this level of inspired acting and vivid characterization? I don't know, it's a mystery.<br/><br/>The direction of John Madden needs singling out for particular praise. I don't know what to say except that it is the director who must, in the end, not only bring the varied abilities of all those assembled into a single gem but to inspire and allow each facet to shine brilliantly. This he certainly does.<br/><br/>The music sets wonderful moods and captures (inspires) a real sense of situation.<br/><br/>Visual sets and costumes are fabulous.<br/><br/>The editing provides a piece that flows so smoothly.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons I see movies is to feel an emotional response and this movie certainly provides that. It all works beautifully - I think one can tell when a company is firing on all cylinders - and I will return to this movie from time to time as no other I have seen."

Just as ""The Dresser"" depended on a working knowledge of Lear for its full effect so ""Shakespeare in love"" will offer more reward to those familiar with the workings of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Twelfth Night"". Having said that,one of the beauties of this marvellous film is that it can be enjoyed by anyone who loves words regardless of their familiarity or otherwise with 16th century drama. Notwithstanding the casting of Miss G.Paltrow in the female lead this is a very English production ,no slick David Mamet one - liners ,just the throw away humour redolent of ""The Fast Show"" very popular on TV in England at that time that also provided a number of members of the cast.Admirers of non - sequitur humour will have a field day. For all that the performances are uniformly first - rate and acknowledging that Miss J.Dench impressed the Academy no end with her showy turn as Queen Elizabeth,""Shakespeare in Love"" is predominantly a writer's triumph.

There was no English settlement of North America during Queen Elizabeth's reign. Jamestown, the ill-fated first attempt at settlement, was not begun until 1607, four years after Queen Elizabeth died and over ten years after this film is set.

A superb cast including Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare), Gwen Paltrow (Viola) & Dame Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth); a witty & captivating screenplay; a vivid portrait of life in Tudor England; ~ in short, a play that could have been written by the Bard with Shakespeare's ""Love"" providing the inspiration for his greatest romantic work ""Romeo and Juliet"". Now, that is a play Queen Elizabeth I would have regally enjoyed in Temple Church!"

","Shakespeare in Love is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. The filming style is unique and the scenes are extremely witty which anyone could catch if they knew anything about Will Shakespeare. The role of Shakespeare could not have been cast any better. Joseph Fiennes did an excellent job. After that performance, he became my most favorite actor. Gweyneth Paltrow was also equally amazing. The story was much more of a comedy than i would have believed. As sad as this sounds, I've probably seen this movie at least 15 times. If you like Shakespeare of a good laugh/drama, then this is the perfect movie. There are very few movies i would give a ten lol but this one surely deserves it! Go watch it!"

","When I first saw Shakespeare in Love over the Christmas holidays of 1998, I was so moved by its story and its message of love conquering over everything.  I never would have suspected it walking off with Best Picture at the Oscars that year, but I am SO GLAD that it did.  Come to think of it, that was the year that Saving Private Ryan was nominated for Best Picture as well and it was almost a certainty that it would end up receiving top accolades that year.  The only thing that I can remember being certain of on Oscar night 1999 was that Gywneth Paltrow would take home an award as Best Actress of the year...and of course, as we all know by now, I was right. Most people say that her performance was over the top in this film but I alas, must disagree.  Paltrow played the role of a woman of aristocratic means betrothed to another man to whom she can show no affection whatsoever just itching to experience the excitement and passion that is live theater as an actress in the day when all of the female roles that were out there were portrayed solely by men.  So, in essence she bucks tradition and goes against everything she's ever known to be right within the world to fulfill her dream and win the heart of the only man she's ever really truly loved: William Shakespeare, played here exquisitely and sexily by Joseph Fiennes. It is a shame that Fiennes' portrayal of the Bard of Avon never garnered any nominations or any awards for that matter at either that years Golden Globes or Oscar Ceremonies.  He truly gave one of that years most riveting and explosive breakout performances.  Dame Judi Dench was amazing as she always is and it was a shame that she wasn't on for more than just eight minutes. Her character, Queen Elizabeth I gives what is in mmy opinion the greatest line in the film: ""I know what it's like to be a woman in a man's profession, God help me I know that.""<br/><br/>So in essence, as much as Shakespeare in Love was a great film, I cannot really understand why, five years later, it won Best Picture that year. I just watched it on DVD last week and found it fun and a great romantic/date film to watch with that special someone in your life but as a film that says something to the masses, this film gets a good push from the starting line but somehow falters in its overall viewpoint by dragging on for at least an excessive ten minutes in the midst of it all.  All I can think is that a romantic comedy finally won Best Picture at the Oscars...and thank heavens for that!!!<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"adipocea","10","0","0","24 December 2002"," The greatest romantic comedy of ALL TIMES
","I really cannot understand why this magnificent movie draws such horrific comments from some people. It just strenghtens my opinion that the cultural level in the western world it's too low nowadays... As for me, this movie is MY NUMBER ONE MOVIE OF ALL TIMES, but this is only a my subjective point of view. Anyway , I'm not exactly a newcomer in this art, viewing that I'm studying movie directing at the Media University in Bucharest. Back to the movie, it is really difficult to begin with something, so numerous are the qualities of this movie. It is simply THE GREATEST SCREENPLAY of all times, with countless gems, witty lines, twists (it is NOT PREDICTABLE OF ALL!), a really luminous down ending(which is a very rare thing). EVERYBODY, BUT I MEAN EVERYBODY, has something ""to eat"" in this movie!...No character is here by chance, from the kid John Webster to Will Shakespeare, the appearance of every character has some meaning. And the development of the plot, reallly of Shakespearean quality, is interweaved magnificently with Romeo and Juliet, the play wich we rediscover in this movie('cause too often we think we've seen all and we know everything about Shakespeare's plays but really we DON'T). It takes a genius of the dimensions of Tom Stoppard(let's not forget Marc Norman) to make this kind of devilishly clever script. The Academy made, in that year, maybe one of it's smartest choices(alongside of the year when they gave the Oscar to Ordinary people). Saving private Ryan seemed to have all the upper hand there. It was very ""american"", with a patriotic message, spectacularly directed, and it was representing a very ambitious to win Steven Spielberg, who is, probably , the most powerful man in film industry right now. But no, the Academy voters were not stupid. They KNEW, they understood very well that Ryan has virtually no plot, it is a heavy handed, ""mechanical"" , predictable plot, with a cheesy patriotic ending. On the other hand , Shakespeare in love had all the odds against it. Released in december, it was representing nobody(except for Bob Weistein, the Miramax boss). John Madden was a nobody, Tom Stoppard was not very well known in America, Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow were not very known and beloved in America(compared to Tom Hanks), it was a British period piece...Some would have said ""Come on, you really expect this to win over Saving private Ryan?!"" But it did...Deservedly... Shakespeare in love has definitely the greatest original score of all times. I really cannot praise enough how great the music composed by Stephen Warbeck for this movie is.The last twenty minutes in the movie are really one of the greatest moments of cinemamaking in history, and the final shot is THE GREATEST SINGLE FINAL SHOT OF ALL TIMES... So, don't listen to the opinions of some uneducated guy, listen to somebody that KNOWS. Go and rent this movie, have a little patience at the beginning, 'cause after that, you will want to see it over and over again..."

","This extremely cleverly scripted screenplay bears the hallmark of Tom Stoppard's finest work. An excellent idea that playfully presents the life of Shakespeare in an accessible if somewhat fictionalised manner.<br/><br/>
Cameo appearances of other noteable renaissance playwrites (such as Marlowe and Webster) add to the intellectual appeal of the film, as does the continual (and often quite subtle) quotation of Shakespeare's own plays within his character's dialogue. All this combined with modern references to Psychiatric treatment and London Taxi Cab drivers (the boatmen on the river Thames) result in a witty and touching cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>To cap it all, the Coup-de-grace of the whole production, comes at the climax with one of the finest productions of Romeo and Juliet one could hope to see, acted by some of the finest actors available to Hollywood. If this was released unedited, perhaps as part of a DVD special edition, I would surely buy it.<br/><br/>All in all, a quality movie. Well worth a look."

Gwyneth Paltrow portrays a wealthy, young woman who is set to be married, but falls in love with William Shakespeare, played by Joseph Fiennes. Shakespeare, who is having writer's block, is inspired by the young woman and manages to write one of his greatest plays of all, Romeo and Juliet. This movie is most entertaining, and quite lovable. Paltrow received her Academy Award statuette for Best Actress while this movie received many other Oscars, including the coveted Best Picture. Judi Dench delivers well in her very small role as Queen Elizabeth, for which she received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. If you haven't seen this, see it just to say that you have seen it.

""Saving Private Ryan"" honors the men who saved the world. ""Shakespeare In Love,"" meanwhile, honors everything that makes the world worth saving-- love, wit, creativity, passion, beauty, and most of all, soul.

"eyeswide","Null","0","0","5 January 1999"," As good as they are saying and better
","This movie is perfect. I can't think of any way it could have been improved. I've never been much of a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow.  However, after this movie, I learn it was not because she has no talent, but rather there hasn't been a movie until now which aptly displayed her talent.  (Although I did think she was very touching in Seven. Tiny part though.)<br/><br/>I predict that now Joseph Fiennes will become something of a matinee idol. His eyes just about make you want to jump on the screen.  Although he's not as conventionally handsome as Ralph, I must say he is much more sexy because he exudes a kind of warmth, energy and vitality which Ralph seems to lack. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't put either of them out if they showed up at my doorstep.<br/><br/>However, I digress.  The supporting cast is superb.  The plot is incredibly clever. The weavings in and out between the play being performed and the story on the screen are jaw-droppingly well-done. The production values and costuming and make-up right down to the rotted-out teeth are completely authentic-looking. I can't say they are authentic because I didn't live then but they sure seemed to be. Kudos to the editors of this film.  The pacing is downright stimulating.<br/><br/>And being a Shakespeare lover, I'm excited to think that a rash of new Shakespeare aficionadoes may be awakened by this movie.<br/><br/>I must also say that it is incredibly, meltingly romantic and I'm a very very hard person to impress on that level.  I cried buckets and wanted to cry more but held back because I was in the middle of a sold-out theater. There is unbelievable chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes. This is probably going to sound shallow but I was amazed considering Gwyneth's real squeeze, Ben Affleck, was in the cast and probably present for a lot of the physical contact between her and JF.  What an acting coup! IF she doesn't win the Oscar, I will be very disappointed.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was a scene stealer, and I also enjoyed Tom Wilkinson from Full Monty as the theater owner/apothecary. Took me awhile to figure out who he was.  Always enjoy seeing Simon Callow too."

","Knowing your Shakespeare is a help but not a must in this fictional episode from his life.  It is chock full of quotes and devices from his plays/sonnets, as well as knowing references to his contemporaries.  All performances are stellar, but most impressive is Gwyneth Paltrow's radiant depiction of Shakespeare's inspiration.  Not only can you feel her emotions but she must have the best accent coach in New York!  Judi Dench, Ben Affleck, Joseph Fiennes, and Geoffrey Rush throw themselves into their often amusing but never undimensional roles.<br/><br/>Still, the joy of this movie for me was its appreciation for the words and the rapturous experience of writing them.  The swirling lovemaking/rehearsal scenes, especially that of the balcony scene, draw you anew into the workings of Shakespeare the Playwright Genius even as you listen to words you read/heard a million times in English class.  Maybe this film will kindle a love of Shakespeare's work in skeptical moviegoers who only give it a chance because of the cast list."

","Occasionally there are movies which inspire not only by their acting but also by their ingenious story and witty writing.  Such a movie is ""Shakespeare in Love"", now out in limited release (you can check it out at smaller art houses, but arrive early to find a seat as every performance is selling out).<br/><br/>The movie, written by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman and Directed by John Madden (amazing what he can do when he isn't commentating on football games :), has probably the wittiest dialogue and most original premise that I've seen in years:  What would happen if Will were a struggling playwright with writer's block, who needs the inspiration of a muse to finish his first big play, tentatively titled ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter""?  Enter lovely Gwyneth Paltrow as a poetry-struck noblewoman who yearns for the stage; she disguises herself as a boy to act in the new production, only to fall for the young poet himself.  But then, she has been engaged in a marriage of convenience to the well-titled but lightly-monied Lord Wessex, and the game is an-on.  What follows is a fascinating play of words, funny situations made more funny by their similarity to modern times (check out the waiter giving out the ""daily special"" at the restaurant - a scream), full-egoed actors fighting for better parts, producers just trying to keep the show going, and intricate Shakespearean changes of scene.  The writers and Director are to be commended for blending the best of the Bard's comedies and making them appealing and understandable to modern audiences. You'll have to watch this flick more than once to catch all the little Elizabethan in-jokes.<br/><br/>The performances are good, with a great cast.  Joseph Fiennes (Ralph's little brother) puts in a good performance as the lovestruck poet, and Gwyneth Paltrow plays the muse beautifully (of course she could play anything 'beautifully' ;), then again, after ""Emma"", if she played dead it would be an improvement.  But the real treat is in the supporting cast, Geoffrey Rush as the producer who believes it all works out in the nick of time by a miracle, Dame Judi Dench as the stern yet human Elizabeth Regina, Ben Affleck as an Elizabethan Tom Cruise with a cruiseship size ego.<br/><br/>My only criticism: although like most good stories the ending is eventually foretellable, it drags a bit.  Of course, considering that the writers were taking on one of the finest writers of all times, someone who understood that after standing for two or three hours the audience wanted a good, strong, quick resolution, the ending is fine, but not up to old Will's standards.  Nevertheless, Joecool recommends this movie, a flick not to be missed.  This is what one gets into the business for."

The lovers played by the pretty but petulant Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are attractive and convincing enough, and their love story is surprisingly moving.  I just felt that the jokes were often a little broad for the delicate little story of love and inspiration, especially a hokey scene with Fiennes and his ""therapist"" played by Sher.

","As a fan of all things Shakespeare I experienced all the emotions possible watching 'Shakespeare in Love'. From joy to passion, longing to loss. Beginning with a brilliant script written by Tom Stoppard appeals to the masses who aren't familiar with the Bard's work, as well as those who are well versed and will catch a fair share of the in jokes and literary as well as historical references made to Mr. Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) and his contemporaries. Not meant as a a literal depiction of Shakespeare's life, the film gives us a what-if-it-happened-like-this scenario that takes us through the development of one of his most famous works 'Romeo and Juilet'. Finding his muse and true love in noblewoman Viola (Gwenyth Paltrow) who longs to trod the boards - a big no-no in Elizabethan England - Shakespeare creates 'R & J' around their romance and the circumstances that surround it. Although Paltrow is getting well-deserved raves for her performance, the real credit should go to Fiennes who breathes life into a man who has been seen for centuries as a literary icon, more than as a man. Fiennes carries us through the film sharing all of the emotions, tribulations, and triumphs that Will goes through. Two other notable performances are given by Geoffrey Rush, and Judi Dench.<br/><br/>No one will be disappointed seeing 'Shakespeare in Love' - a must see."

","At last, a movie that combines intelligence, wit, and romance in a historical setting.  Gwyneth Paltrow is radiant and makes it completely believable that her character would change Shakespeare's life.  Joseph Fiennes plays Will Shakespeare as an occasionally brilliant, but tapped-out, writer that has ""lost his muse"" until he meet the lovely Viola De Lesseps (Paltrow).<br/><br/>Though set in the 1500s the English is modern, snappy, and easy to follow. Knowledge of Shakespeare's works is NOT required at all (but would add to the humor).  Although often billed as a comedy, this movie is more of a love story with comedic elements.  But don't let the ""Shakespeare"" or ""Love story"" monikers scare you away from this excellent film.  Go see it!  And bring a date!"

Some of you people need to lighten up!<br/><br/>Second, as a fan of the excellent actor, Colin Firth, I'm surprised no one has mentioned here what a wonderful ""bad guy"" this very romantic leading man made (He was Darcy in the best ""Pride and Prejudice"" ever made, the 1995 A & E mini-series.)  As interpreted by Firth, even Wessex deserves a measure of sympathy.  He is a financially challenged nobleman with the ambition to regain his fortune in the New World, a very appropriate endeavor in Elizabethan society.  Of course, that means marrying money, i.e., the rich heiress.  Next viewing, watch Firth's eyes for all the subtle little expressions that reveal his inner struggles.  This is not a buffoon or one dimensional villain.  One may not approve of Wessex, but Colin Firth gets an A+ for his performance.<br/><br/>To find a terrific joke on us audience members, check casting of Queen Elizabeth's ladies-in-waiting.  Bridget McConnel and Georgie Glen who flanked Elizabeth in almost every scene were the same two women who attended Judi Dench's Victoria in ""Mrs. Brown.""

For example I thought that the acting was very well done. I believe Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow did a great job there! I also really liked the costumes and the scenery.

","In my opinion ""Shakespeare in Love"" was a nice movie, but it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen. I think Joseph Fiennes did a great job. I was impressed how passionately he played Shakespeare. On the other hand Gwyneth Paltrow was extremely boring and had absolutely no passion during her performance. The plot was good. I especially liked the open ending. It made me think of what might have happened to Shakespeare and ""her love"" after they had been seperated from each other. Besides, I think that it was a good production, it showed the social background during Shakespeare's lifetime and the movie was quite funny as well. But I think the movie must have shown more about Shakespeare's live. Mostly it was just a love story made in Hollywood (or somewhere else). And I hate the ""poor-man-meets-a-rich-woman""-stories. It was too unrealistic and not based on Shakespeare's life experiences. I believe that he didn't find a girl that way. To make it short.

","I gave this movie 10 out of 10, and I can supply to you only one justification for that action: there were no higher scores available.<br/><br/>It is a hypothetical recreation of what might have been happening in Shakespeare's life at the time he created Romeo and Juliet. It is passionate, touching, contains both high humor and low. It is filled with both loving in-jokes and clear mass appeal. Co-author Tom Stoppard is a Shakespeare scholar, perhaps I should say a Shakespeare lover, who represented the period as accurately as possible without interrupting the accessibility of his story. The authors even threw in a couple of jokey anachronisms that would have pleased Shakespeare himself. (He's drinking from a coffee cup that says ""Souvenir of Stratford upon Avon"", and the ferrymen on the Thames are eerily identical to today's cab drivers)<br/><br/>If Shakespeare himself had access to modern technology, he could not write a much better movie script than this. How good is it? The screenwriters' words are juxtaposed to Shakespeare's own for two hours, and stand up well. I'm not saying they are as good as Shakespeare, but anyone who can stand next to Shakespeare and not be embarrassed by the comparison is one seriously good writer.<br/><br/>If Stoppard and his partner don't win best screenplay for this movie, then even-handed justice exists not in humankind."

It seems to me that the makers of this movie were trying to do the number one on my list, and they succeeded. It's well written, well acted, funny and sad.....Shakespeare in Love is all of these things. From the opening scenes to the credits I was entertained and I left the cinema feeling good. So what do I care about historical inaccuracies in a movie that isn't even trying to be so...So the costumes weren't accurate for the time period...The historical reality is that we still can't be absolutely sure who William Shakespeare was, or even whether he wrote all of the plays attributed to him. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is...Entertainment. If I go to see a movie like, Saving Private Ryan, I expect it to be within the realms of some historical accuracy, because that is the purpose of the movie.<br/><br/>Well done to everyone involved in making this movie for keeping me entertained and therefore happy for two hours!<br/><br/>So...

It bears re-viewing because of the many ""in-jokes"" to plays of the Bard.  SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is well worth the rental fee and the need to pay attention throughout.  It's not a ""family"" film, in my opinion, due to the frank depiction of lovemaking; watch it at home with young people who are at least 18 or 19 but talk to them about what was the ""big deal"" as far as monogamy and workplace affairs go and STILL IS!

Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Finnes, Geoffrey Rush, and Ben Affleck, just to name a few.  I always thought Paltrow was just a glamorous movie star but with Shakespeare, she proves that she can really act and not just act, but act well.  She deserves the Oscar for best actress because no one else could have portrayed Viola better than she can.  Joseph Finnes was just as brilliant.  The little brother of Ralph Finnes can act just as well.  The supporting cast was remarkable.  The movie would not have been what it is without them.

","Very enjoyable experience! Reminded me of ""Amadeus"" in that it is a personal story about a great artist and creativity. I am not familiar with Shakespeare's life but the story is a completely reasonable version of how his great works could have developed. The story set in Wil Shakespeare's era and we see Wil dealing with problems that writers today have to deal with, such as making ends meet, writer's block, and creativity. We see how  Shakespeare's own experiences are written into his plays. I saw the movie with 3 others who all gave it high marks."

"DeeNine-2","9","0","0","26 April 2000"," Hollywood at its best
","This is the kind of movie the Academy loves and through its love, rewards.<br/><br/>The script by Stoppard and Norman is erudite and cunning, passionate and playful, filled with witticisms by and about the Bard; and the parallels to Shakespeare and his work, especially the play within a play, Romeo and Juliet, and the play to come, Twelfth Night, are marvelous and a bit miraculous. The romantic direction by Madden conjures up an Elizabethan England and its London theatre with enough lusty color to delight the poet himself. The acting is wonderful with Gwyneth Paltrow conquering a very demanding and delightful role as Viola/Tom Kent that will beckon and challenge actresses for decades to come. Joseph Fiennes as the young Shakespeare writing his Romeo and Juliet on the fly, fired with the energy from his adulterous love for the lovely Viola, is better than advertised.<br/><br/>Of course what would a Shakespearean play or a great Hollywood movie be without its bit players and supporting roles? Judi Dench as the queen in her Academy Award winning performance gives the impression of somebody doing something marvelously well but with such ease as to look unemployed. (I stole that line from somewhere.)<br/><br/>From the gutter snipe with his rodents to the queen's bad teeth, from Colin Firth's delightfully villainous Lord Wessex to Geoffrey Rush's wise, but bumbling stage manager, from the tavern trollops to the gentry at the ball (in which the sonnet within a play from Romeo and Juliet is once again given life by Fiennes and Paltrow) everything is expertly presented.<br/><br/>This is Hollywood at its best. For all the clunkers and the mass-mindless indulgences that are the usual fare-tinsel town, you are forgiven!<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","Shakespeare in Love is pure fiction that just happens to use historic people as characters.  Don't come to this film hoping it will answer your questions about the real Will's private life but it is an imaginative conceit as to how the Bard concocted his plots.<br/><br/>It is also very modern.  This is a poor depiction of Elizabethean life. Syntax, make-up, social situations etc. make this less a costume drama than a modern movie set in the late 1600s. But that's okay.  Accepting that, Stoppard's allusions to Shakespearean trivia and the evolution of Romeo and Ethel and the Pirate King to the masterpiece we now know was delightful. The scenes between Fiennes and Paltrow tended to slow the march to opening night, er, afternoon, a bit, but the electricity surrounding the premiere made the wait worth it.<br/><br/>I'm surprised no-one has cited Tom Wilkinson's superb performance as the moneyman, Fennyman.  He does an excellent job of developing his character from a money-grubbing Shylock to a lover of theater.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching his transformation and sensing, through him, that something special was evolving out of the comedy Shakespeare had originally been commissioned to do (according to the movie, that is)."

","Ignore the nay sayers when they talk of Oscars won out of turn,  the Academy Awards have never been based on merit, instead watch the film.  Paltrow's performance is moving, Dench's commanding, and while Fiennes may not be an inspired choice, that his role lacks the poise and sense of humor of Everett's Marlowe is surely deliberate!  Afterall, Marlowe is considered by many the greatest playwright of his time.<br/><br/>It is Stoppard's writing that really deserves greatest praise, he captures the spirit of Shakespeare so well.  It is intelligent, funny, romantic and believable, whereas it could so easily have been arrogant, clearly Stoppard loves the work of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The in jokes (and there aren't too many) do not detract from the central story of love found and lost.  So what if a London (river) taxi driver says he had Marlowe in the back of his cab once?  This just plays to the stereotype of London taxi drivers, (noted on the pages of Private Eye since the 60's).<br/><br/>A chick flick? Perhaps, but this single male watched it on his own and am glad I did.  I'll be glad to watch it in the future with a girlfriend.

Maybe Wessex was headed for one of these failed settlements and had lost money on a previous failure?  Nitpicking, perhaps, but Americans really ought to know their history."

","A number of years ago I happened to see an SCTV sketch which depicted William Shakespeare in the back of the Globe theatre furiously attempting to finish the last scenes of Hamlet, when he was suddenly cornered by two actors demanding more money. Francis Bacon, the play's producer, refused the actor's demands and ordered Shakespeare on the spot to write the two men out of the work.  Shakespeare complied.  And, taking quill in hand, he quickly scribbled out that greatest of all clinker, `...Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead....'<br/><br/>
It is with a similar lighthearted touch that Shakespeare in Love takes us into the dreamed up world of the English playwright's back stage life to depict the powerful love affair which provided him with the literary `stuff' for Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>Or course, the merit of the movie rest not on the historical accuracy of its rather concocted Elizabethan tale, but rather on the clever way it manages to fashion and weave the little earthy pieces of Shakespeare's own life, situation, and romance into the material which would become the magic of the world's greatest romance.  Tom Stoppard, whom, I understand, wrote the screenplay's final draft, has reframed Romeo and Juliet within a sparkling context which manages to both explode and reinvigorate the spirit of the original work.<br/><br/>While some of the film's comic schtick does, at times, get a little overbearing, Shakespeare in Love is certainly one of the cleverest romps I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it immensely, and cannot recommend it highly enough."

","In a holiday season so full of movies that so closely missed their mark and earned a respectable four out of five stars, it's quite a breath of fresh air to finally see a film so deserving of a full five out of five. Wonderful acting is combined with a brilliant screenplay and meticulous attention to being a period piece in John Madden's latest film, ""Shakespeare in Love.""<br/><br/>While the premise is somewhat kitschy, the screenplay is brilliantly run along its lines and the acting is just superb. Joseph Fiennes plays a struggling young William Shakespeare who finds that his writing abilities have been of late dissipating rapidly. In desperation, he tries to launch a new play, prematurely entitled ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.""<br/><br/>At tryouts, Shakespeare is none too impressed with the abilities of the players until the final actor takes the stage. This actor, however, is reluctant to be encountered by the over-eager Shakespeare and makes a hasty retreat.<br/><br/>All is shown to the audience that this actor is truly Viola De Lesseps, who is soon to be betrothed to the detestable Lord Wessex, played by Colin Firth. However, as women were not allowed to enter onto the theatre stage in 1593, Viola continues to assume the identity of a man and returns to the playhouse, only to be cast in the part of Romeo.<br/><br/>Viola's ruse is soon discovered by Shakespeare and they fall madly in love, which is where the movie really takes off. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are magnificent together and absolutely shimmer onscreen. The screenplay, by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, is a treat in itself and even some of Shakespeare's writing is creatively interspersed in the script.<br/><br/>Truly a film not to be missed and one that will hopefully enjoyed by many this holiday season.

"almagary-2","10","0","0","29 December 1998"," Non-serious view of Shakespeare may be best approach
","Shakespeare in Love is a delightful and very funny film.  It's unhistorical but an entirely valid artistic appreciation of Shakespeare and his works as popular entertainment in both his time (theater in confined spaces) and our time (this movie is, after all, an adaptation of Romeo & Juliet) and--credit Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman's literate, fast-paced screenplay--poetry and prose for reading.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes is very intense as Shakespeare, credible but in his intensity maybe too 20th century in style. Indeed, this is accentuated by a great gag at the beginning in which he lies on a couch and analyzes his situation--writer's block--under the questioning of one Dr. Moth.  Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful as Viola and, when pretending to be a young male actor, does Romeo in so attractive a way I found myself wondering if she could conceivably follow Olivier and Branagh and portray Henry V.  Of course, in this film she also has the natural role as a well-endowed blonde of unusual attraction (and acting ability).<br/><br/>All the secondary characters are terrific, particularly Geoffrey Rush as the impresario Henslowe, Martin Clunes as his rival Burbage, and Tom Wilkinson as a less than angelic angel named Fennyman.<br/><br/>As father of a couple of PG/PG-13 daughters, I can hardly wait for a couple of years to show them this movie on tape.  Right now the sex is too graphically bawdy.  Were it not for this sex, in fact, I would instantly want every high school English I or II class watch this movie for the simple reason that a movie that is great entertainment because it is none too serious should have the great benefit of stimulating a very serious interest in the whole Shakespeare--the bard and the guy, his sonnets and his jokes, the plays on both stage and page.<br/><br/>One unbelievable thing about this film:  Universal opened it at exactly one small art house in San Francisco.  I just can't believe they didn't put more money into marketing it and open it at several multiplexes.  Maybe John (Shakespeare in Love) Madden can give the impresarios and moneymen at Universal some character roles in his next movies to improve *their* characters!"

Judi Dench makes for the most formidable Royalty! both here and in Mrs. Brown, so I am rather glad that I did not have the misfortune to have been born into those Eras.

","I hesitate to compare the writers of this film, Mr. Norman and Mr. Stoppard, to Mr. Shakespeare, but I know the latter would have enjoyed it.  He often took real people and facts about their lives and with artistic license wove wonderful stories So it is with the writers of this film and their subject Will Shakespeare. I must say I'm sure a lot of license was taken but their take on relating it and weaving into the life of young Will was pure entertaining genius.  I don't want to mention any specifics here.  Let me say that you should not let the subject of Shakespeare or the Elizabthean period scare you away.  Just as Shakespeare wrote for the masses and his take on the human condition is still relevant today, this film has characters and relationships that are as valid today as then.  The film cont ains love, hate, passion, duty, willfulness anger, and all other aspects of humanity. It also contains many well written laugh out loud exchanges.  Besides this the actors from the leads on down were ALL excellent.  My highest praise goes to Mr. Fiennes. He is a real find.  He brought a young passionate Shakespeare to life and I look forward to seeing his next film.  Ms. Paltrow was also good as Viola, his leading lady.  I was also impressed by the performance of Mr. Rush who I am used to seeing in parts somewhere between serious and sinister.  He has a gift for comedy as well. Outstanding performances were also given by Mr. Everett (Marlowe), Shakespeare's sometimes rival--sometimes friend, Mr. Affleck (Ned Allen), Shakespeare's leading actor, and Ms. Dench in a fantastic portra yal of Queen Elizabeth.  This was truly one of the best movies of 1998 and it is a pity it does not seem to be in wide release.  I would encourage you to make an effort to see it.  You will not be disappo inted.

","As a costume drama, Shakespeare in Love succeeds.  As accurate theatrical history, it begs the question.  Movies reflect the issues of their day.  So does this one.  A woman playing Juliet is a nice role reversal that Shakespeare would have loved.  In fact, he did have a woman playing a man falling in love with another man.  What the Romeo and Juliet scenes lack is the passion of young love.  These actors are much older than their parts. The final scenes are not tragic, leaving the audience's outburst at the end puzzling.  Yet as a film that depicts something of the fun of Elizabethan times and its drama, it succeeds and can be quite useful for people who will never see a Shakespearean play."

","A depiction of William Shakespeare during his early years with the Globe Theater is laudable enough.  When you add the light-hearted, humorous Tom Stoppard script, the result is a near-masterpiece.<br/><br/>Although the film is wonderful, the casting of Joseph Fiennes as the Bard and Gwenyth Paltrow as his muse, Viola, may be suboptimal.  Fiennes plays Will impeccably, but his brooding, serious-looking countenance seems less appropros for the greatest playwright than a wry, garrulous, or sly disposition.  Likewise, Paltrow appears too staid and reserved for the role of a muse, who one might expect to be bright and cheery.<br/><br/>The film might also have benefitted from a more detailed presentation of theatrical production during the time of Shakespeare, and by further delineation of the genius of Shakespeare beyond the muse thesis, however speculative.

","This was certainly one of the most imaginative movies of the year and it was pretty good.  The idea was definitely unique, and it was a thoughtful portrayal of something that didn't happen, at least not to anyone's knowledge.  By bringing Will Shakespeare down to the same level as any modern day young person who is struggling with love, this film has helped us understand Shakespeare as a person, and not just a poet and writer of plays who used words like thou, wilt, and shalt.  It might not have been an accurate story, but it was not meant to be.  And if it helps boost an interest in Shakespeare that might not have been there before for some people, then perhaps it has done some good.  I did think that the movie could have targeted a larger audience by leaving out some unnecessary nudity.  Without the nudity I believe the love scenes would have still had the same effect, and the movie could have garnered a PG-13 rating, boosting audience potential.  Just my opinion."

","In an age of dumbed-down screenplays and often disappointing performances,screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard and actress Gwyneth Paltrow offer a freshly clever relief in their new work, Shakespeare in Love. The script was daring, clever, funny and tragic at the same time. And Paltrow, quickly blossoming into one of Hollywood's best actresses, was enchanting. The fantastically appropriate costuming and set design along with the star-packed cast helped this intelligent project to reach its full potential.

Namely that such things do exist, and it is only through one another that we can attain such heights, such metaphysical experiences, and it is thanks to one another that we have such a memory with us forever. For it is truly better to have loved - with such a frenzied passion - and lost than to have never loved at all. As for me - I am happier.

"Primtime","9","0","0","10 March 1999"," Excellent script and tremendous imagery
","Shakespeare In Love is a great film that is fully deserving of its 13 Oscar nominations. Everything about this film seems to click, working together like fine clockwork in order to hit perfection. I believe that if it wasn't for Mr. Spielberg and his scathing view of the battles of Normandy, this film would already have won Best Picture; no questions asked.<br/><br/>I had high expectations before going to see this film and later found myself not wanting to leave as the ending credits rolled across the screen, it was simply that good. Tom Stoppard wrote one of the most literary enchanted screenplays that I have ever heard, if you didn't watch this film rather only listened to it, the whole effect would still be there. The beautifully crafted love story, the constant inside jokes about Shakespeare and how he got some of his ideas, the effortless dialogue between supporting characters that added so much to the film and the interesting ideas presented (Romeo and Ethel, the pirate's daughter) make for a sure winner of Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>John Madden must also be commended for his work here regardless of the fact he really had quite a lot to work with. The film flows at an excellent pace throughout and at times has the quickness to tie in any scenes that may be lacking the full throttle. The presentation of the sets, characters and emotions are very clear and striking. The whole scene in which Romeo and Juliet was finally played was one of the greatest ever put together and had me sitting on the edge of my seat, without using any explosions or other devices that are so common in films today.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Palthow gives what I believe is her best performance to date and is surely Oscar material. She seems to radiate at all times on the screen, even when she is dressed as a boy. Her accent flows naturally and she manages to pull off tremendous beauty while still can be regarded as just another member of the play. Joseph Fiennes plays a young William Shakespeare as troubled at times like when he has writer's block and full of panache at times like when he finally finishes the play and all the while he falls in love with the mystical Viola (Gwyneth Palthow).<br/><br/>All supporting characters fully hit the mark, especially Geoffrey Rush as the bumbling Philip Henstowe. Perhaps he is at his best right at the beginning of the film when he is about to get his feet burnt off. Dame Judi Dench also gives a short yet strong performance as Queen Elizabeth. Regardless of what others may say about her lack of lines in the film, she still fully deserves a nomination for a supporting role since few others could have pulled it off quite like her. I love the scene in which she tells Viola's soon to be husband, Lord Essex about how she knows Viola has already been... well s*****d if you will. This is pure cinematic gold.<br/><br/>I really loved this film, although it still ranks below Saving Private Ryan as my best of 1998. Even though I believe that Ryan will win for Best Picture, I wouldn't be at all surprised if Shakespeare snuck in and stole it from right underneath Spielberg.<br/><br/>9/10 stars."

","First, let me say that I am a Shakespeare fan, having both acted and viewed many performances through the years. As an actor, I was thrilled at the very idea of ""Shakespeare in Love."" Let me also add that I am a great fan of Gwyneth Paltrow. As the 230th commentator on ""S in L"", let me just say I was disappointed. I have to blame, in order, the writers and the director. To have assembled such a fine cast of actors and then to race them through such a tired, half-baked scenario-well, let's just say it was a letdown. First, you writers, shame be upon you for letting the two leads get together so early in the story. Whatever happened to the absolute ecstasy of sexual tension? You had a perfect premise (woman masquerading as man) and you blew it. Where would the plot of Twelfth Night have been if Viola had slept with Orlando within the first half hour of washing ashore? Besides, I suspect if anyone could pull off sexual tension and frustration, it would be that tasty boy Joe Fiennes. Speaking of sex, I didn't *get* that Paltrow was so hot for the lad she would shuck all her highborn ways without even a glance backward. You say you wanted to make it more modern? Well then, shame on you again for choosing to embrace in our modern culture the trait of mindless and instant gratification.<br/><br/>Now the direction... These actors positively *raced* through this script! They would have been much better served to be clothed in track suits than doublets. What was the all fired hurry? I got a sense that Madden was sitting just out of frame with stopwatch in hand and whistle clenched between teeth, chanting ""The holes, the holes, you could drive a lorry through them!."" No, this entire project was well conceived and ill carried out, in my humble opinion."

And somehow it manages to blend all these together with never a false note, always both true to its own spirit and to truth itself. The ending is bittersweet but honest, with no contrived happy ending.

Well I've heard that line regarding a few Shakespeare related films, for instance Romeo and Juliet, the Zeffirelli production with Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting. I remember seeing that at the Paris Theatre, by the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, a favorite cinema when I lived there. It was a great film. I stood on line for hours and had to take a seat in the second row.

However it is a most enjoyable film. It is lighthearted, and lots of fun. I could not help but think of it as some sort of Disney treatment of the period, after seeing Elizabeth the night before. The theatre scenes are quite good, I thought. Even though they take place in the old days, the scenes project the world of entertainment, where people mostly have a good time. Everything in the film contributes to that good feeling, the lovely custumes, the little theatre, the street scenes, the healthy looking young specimens... Their Elizabeth, though much older than in ""Elizabeth"", is bedecked and bejeweled beyond description, but has a sense of humor. She turns up at the theatre in the last scene to collect on the wager regarding whether the feeling of love could be adequately captured on the stage. In some surveys Gweyneth Palrow is the favorite, but I think that the actress that plays the lead role in Elizabeth has more of an opportunity to display a wider range of acting talent, and does throughout that film.

","What a wonderful conceit! Imagine being at the first performance of Romeo And Juliet, in a London theatre all those years ago, and Will Shakespeare himself is playing Romeo!<br/><br/>Shakespeare In Love was co-written with Marc Norman by Tom Stoppard. They also penned Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead; a marvellous play which retold Hamlet from the point of view of two of Hamlet's minor characters.<br/><br/>Their latest film imagines that Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) wrote Romeo And Juliet when he himself was a star crossed lover and that his Juliet was Viola (played by Gwyneth Paltrow). She plays Juliet against his Romeo on stage with him!<br/><br/>Now that's a delightful idea and only one aspect of what is a very witty and clever script. There's a good deal of pleasure to be had enjoying the many references to a good number of the Bard's famous lines from his other plays.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of fun with Shakespeare's rivalry with contemporary playwright Thomas Marlow and with the sheer mechanics of getting a play onto the stage especially if the money has dried up and if there's a bad case of writer's block.<br/><br/>And how better to overcome a wilting of the quill than with a rich lover like Viola. She's pledged to another man and they are denied one another. As they play out the Romeo And Juliet scenes in real life, they later create the same magic on the stage, triumphantly. Shakespeare In Love even manages to bring some life to the acting of the wooden Gwyneth Paltrow.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush's part is fun but you'd think a little light on for an Academy Award but Judi Dench as the elderly Queen Elizabeth is masterful. Jo Fiennes is a bit too even throughout the film but the music from Australian composer David Hirschfelder, the sets and particularly the script is first class.<br/><br/>And  I'll be always grateful for the recreation of that original Romeo And Juliet performance."

","This seems to be a site where fans rave about their favorite movies so I hope no-one will mind if I say I didn't like this film very much at all and wonder what all the fuss is about.  I laughed maybe three times during the screening, the film seemed too long and I didn't find it very romantic.<br/><br/>My problems with the film began with the two leads.  Ms Paltrow is pretty but, unfortunately, not much of an actress (see ""Elizabeth"" if you want to see good acting).  Consequently, I found it very hard to believe the character she played could ever ""inspire"" Shakespeare let alone fool him into thinking she was a man by just wearing a mustache.  Joseph Finnes was OK but his Shakespeare seems more like a modern sitcom lead than a great playwright.  I suppose the movie makers were trying to make the ""great man"" accessible to all us unsophisticated moderns but I found it uncomfortable and almost insulting to think that Shakespeare was so foolish a person and basically solved his writer's block by sleeping with a pretty girl.  As ""fun"" a concept as this is, it begs the question: if all it takes is sex, why aren't there more great writers around?! If you've had a regular education it's not hard to follow the Shakespearean references but those jokes get old pretty fast.  It's almost as if the writers are trying to make you feel smart by telling old jokes with fancy language.  I guess that really was my bottom line feeling; that I was being manipulated by some clever writers and actors into thinking I was seeing something better, brilliant and more witty when, in fact, it was only trivial and ordinary. The best thing about this film was Judy Dench as the queen.  She really did a great job and made most of the rest of the cast look like they were playing in a loud, unfunny, costumed high school play.  I'm sorry to be so negative but the only intelligent, accurate review of this movie that I've read was in the Village Voice so I thought I'd add my own."

","""Shakespeare in Love"" didn't jump out and shout 'I'm a classic movie and you will worship me for years to come' but it DID quietly whisper a subtle elegance in execution. Witty, charming, bawdy, dramatic... words to describe even the bard's own work. Though some people found some of the allusions a little esoteric, I was laughing most of the way. Shakespeare's own themes were reflected in the one screenplay - love, drama, passion, mistaken identities and misplaced affection... along with some slapstick fun. The cast were wonderfully connective and the setting, accurate.

","Historically, not much is known about William Shakespeare's private life during or after his marriage to Anne Hathaway in Stratford-on-Avon.

That said, you may now sit back and enjoy the crafty manipulations imposed by the writers.<br/><br/>Every convention known to Shakespere in his time has been artfully adopted to give this film its warmth, its humour, and its pathos. Nothing is spared, giving it just the right amount of seriousness without slowing down its pace or evoking ennui. And just as it might be going over the top -- it stops.

Geoffrey Rush got the nod for the best supporting actor, yet in truth, his role is no larger nor better performed than the entire ensemble.  The added bonus to this film--which appears the only criticism by some who claim they were dissapointed--is that it is sufficiently contemporary to be easily understood, while retaining the essence of the time period.  Some purists and elitists may feel that any loss of Elizabethan dialogue is a slap to Shakespeare. This group undoubtedly hates ""West Side Story"" for the same reasons.  Don't believe it!

","One thing about this film disturbs me. I heard a schoolgirl say, It was wonderful. I have been studying Romeo and Juliet  in class, and now it is so good to know what Shakespeare was really like.' Okay, so most people know this is sheer fiction, that it no more tells us what Shakespeare was really like', than Shakespeare's tragedy tells us what King Richard the Third was really like'. But there will be some people who go through life thinking that Shakespeare was really like' this.  Film is such a powerful medium that often such an impression is difficult to brush off. I have met intelligent people who think Thomas More was really like' Robert Bolt's unhistorical and anachronistic version in that fine film A Man for all Seasons. The Shakespeare of this screenplay is a long way from the ambivalent man we glimpse in the Sonnets as Katherine Duncan-Jones's wonderful introduction to the new Arden Edition of the Sonnets (London, 1997) shows. And here comes the really dangerous bit. Once you think you know what Shakespeare was really like', it is a short step to thinking you know what he really meant'. And that suggests there is a right' way and a wrong' way to do the plays; it allows the possibility of definitive performances. The glory of Shakespeare is that we know virtually nothing about him except what the plays tell us. And the plays tell us what we are able to hear. By interpreting Shakespeare's plays, we learn about ourselves. All interpretations are valid. But that wonderful fact is in danger if people start to think they know what Shakespeare is really like'.<br/><br/>So enjoy the film, have a good laugh, but please don't think there is any connection at all between the fictional character in this film and the man from Stratford-upon-Avon who wrote the plays. He is as much of a mystery as ever - and thank God for it."

What a refreshingly original premise.<br/><br/>Both Gwynneth Paltrow & Jo Fiennes (ie Ralph's brother, whom I now understand is more properly to be pron. as ""Rafe"") work well together, and the romance is engaging without being cloying - accepting the fact that Elizabethan prose was somewhat purple in comparison with today's patois (a noticeable absence of expletives!  Which I'm sure _isn't_ realistic).  The rest of the cast is excellent, even when they are only there for an instant - the great stage Shakespearean actor, Anthony Sher, for e.g.  Geoffrey Rush is hilarious as a bumbling & dangerously debt laden theatre owner; while Dame Judi Dench make a sharp-witted & perspicacious Elizabeth I (scary makeup!); the only person who looks anachronistic is Ben Affleck, his Pommie (English) accent is acceptable, BUT, his square-jawed visage just looks way too modern & _Yank_ for him to be extant in the late 1500s - his teeth are too perfect!  But then, maybe that's me imposing my constructed view from seeing Ben in other flicks.<br/><br/>Tom Stoppard's script is light & brilliantly interwoven to the rich material that Shakespeare offers.  I'm sure you'll recall some of Tom's lines after the event, despite the towering offerings from the Bard.<br/><br/>Last, the costumes & sets are splendidly periodical - the last right down to the throwing out of the window of the night's ordure: you had to keep your eyes about you in Elizabethan Englande to avoid the joys of such hazards. <br/><br/>9/10"

I actually stayed until the last final credit scrolled by to hear every note in spectacular digital sound.<br/><br/>Shakespeare in Love has a little for everyone, humor, romance, fine language, good acting, and something often rare in today's films, a good old-fashioned story."

","This movie was definitely one of the top films for capturing the elements of a young Shakespeare in the Elizabethan age, all the while managing to entertain us.  Joseph Fiennes definitely establishes himself as a rising star in this one, and Gwyneth Paltrow portrays her character in a way I've never seen her do before.  Geoffrey Rush, as well as other more minor characters (such as Ben Affleck) round out a superb cast. The story itself is somewhat, but not altogether predictable, too.  It was interesting to see young Will visiting a crude psychologist, for example, because his quill would not write.  In addition, the inclusion of such literary/historical figures as Richard Burbage and Christopher Marlowe makes this movie somewhat educational as well.  Unfortunately, school classrooms will not be able to view this because of some sexual content that does, in fact, move the plot forward.  That is unfortunate because Fiennes' portrayal definitely breaks the stereotype of Shakespeare as boring."

"Andrew","10","0","0","15 January 1999"," A wonderful film
","Shakespeare in Love is a film about great literature disguised as a romantic comedy.  By following the romance and adventure of two very sympathetic characters (Shakespeare and Viola), the audience is shown the magic of great literature.  Generations of high school students have been force-fed the works of the Bard without being given any feeling for how truly special they are.  This film personalizes the romance, the comedy, and the profound sadness of Shakespeare's work.  Above all else, it is accessible.  A filmgoer with very little knowledge of Shakespeare can leave this film with a greater appreciation for and interest in his works.<br/><br/>All of the performances are wonderful, but special mention goes to Geoffrey Rush as an hilariously bedraggled theatre owner.<br/><br/>Incidentally, try not to judge the historical facts of the film too closely. Virginia had not been colonized at the time of the writing of Romeo & Juliet, but such small details do not detract from a truly special film."

","If you liked Elizabeth, you will probably enjoy this lighthearted romp.  If you do enjoy Shakespeare in Love but you haven't seen Elizabeth, see it.<br/><br/>Not being a seasoned movie critic, I can say only that I came away from this film preview having really enjoyed the show.  It was fun, witty, entertaining, and even vaguely intellectual.  However, it was also (too often) slow paced, and perhaps not as intelligent as it presumed itself to be.  The bittersweet ending was drawn out perhaps too long, but it still worked for me.<br/><br/>On the whole, the actors do not disappoint.  Joseph Fiennes as a youthful Will Shakespeare was outstanding once again (again = playing opposite Cate Blanchett in the 1998 release Elizabeth).  Gwyneth Paltrow, beautiful and convincing.  Judi Dench strong and confident as an amused Queen E.  However, this movie is not to be taken too seriously - the focus is definitely entertainment, not history.  There is little pure Elizabethan dialog (only during the plays/practices, which are brief enough to hold the interest of a mature audience).  The set is fantastic, but not as dreary and perhaps accurate as the outstanding props/set/scenery in Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you are looking for a historically exact docudrama suitable for mandatory viewing in graduate-level history courses, disappointment awaits you.  However, if you seek a reasonably intelligent but thoroughly entertaining date movie, allez vous!<br/><br/>Criticisms: a little heavy on the love scenes and on Paltrow's naked upper torso, but no raunchy orgasms or full frontal nudity.  The set is wonderful, but perhaps too pretty, too glossy for the time period.  A better glimpse at the life of W. Shakespeare was desired but not delivered - we never see him eat, bathe, change clothes, or otherwise live.  Occasionally slow paced, particularly during plays/practices.  Play dialog delivered rapidly, presumably so as not to lose the audience.<br/><br/>Cautions: no belly laughs, just numerous good-humoured chuckles, and one or two sniffles.  It helps if you are familiar with a few of Shakespeares plays, but is not necessary.<br/><br/>For the entertainment, I gave this movie a solid 8.<br/><br/>bis@priv.net Vancouver, BC"

Kudos for Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth - mindful of Betty Davis with her sharp tongue.

It is very clear that they know the theatre history of the Age and feel free to tinker with it, lovingly and knowingly. They also evidence humor in their writing in entirely appropriate ways, as well as passion. How wonderful for lovers to woo each other with the lover's lines from ""Romeo and Juliet!""  This completely changes the love making scenes and enriches them. ALL the actors do a good job, including Ben Affleck.  John Fiennes is especially good in the title role; with an expressive face and voice and familiarity with the lines.  I would really like to see him make a film of another Shakespearean play -- or perform in a theatre production of Shakespeare. This is a delightful film - a film to love. Those are rare.

Everything else, however, was about as perfect as one could wish.  The dialogue captured Shakespeare wonderfully, full of double, even triple or quadruple entendres, and of course Shakespeare's own lines were delivered so well that we left the theater feeling that we had just seen performances that set the standard for all time.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Imelda Staunton, and all the cast were about as perfect as they could be. Incredible.

I was resigned to the idea that the romantic comedy died with Cary Grant and Spencer Tracey, but Shakespeare in Love proves that the genre still has a pulse.

"cochise-5","Null","4","12","14 August 2000"," An homage to Shakespeare and his times.
","`Shakespeare in Love' is a must-see movie. It is suspenseful, exciting, and romantic - all things a good movie should be. And, lets face it, there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.<br/><br/>The film takes a real event (the creation of the play, `Romeo and Juliet') and presents a fictional reason why that event occurred. And if the fictional reason is plausible (as it is in `Shakespeare in Love'), then the movie can be fascinating for the audience. In the film, the reason behind the creation of the play was a fictional romance between Shakespeare and Viola.<br/><br/>Several of the comedic situations in the film are classic Shakespeare. These are situations involving women dressed as men, mistaken identities, and the use of disguises. The comedy arises from the consequences of the characters being in these situations.<br/><br/>The world created by the director feels real enough to step into. But you would have to be careful where you stepped. This was the point made by the incident where a bit of garbage (or sewage) was thrown out of a top floor window and narrowly missed one of the characters walking down the street. This was a fairly common event in Shakespearean London.<br/><br/>In the film, the portrayal of the back-stage feeling the actors had when they were rehearsing or performing `Romeo and Juliet' was very real. I felt like I was there. The film made me feel what it would have been like to be in the audience who saw `Romeo and Juliet' for the very first time. How lucky that audience was!<br/><br/>The scene where the stutterer presented the prologue is totally realistic. A stutterer suddenly getting his or her voice when giving a speech is a well-documented phenomenon. (By the way, the prologue, as presented by the character in `Shakespeare in Love' was far superior to the prologue in Baz Luhrmann's production of `Romeo and Juliet' - starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In my opinion, Luhrmann's `Romeo and Juliet' was a very poor interpretation of Shakespeare.)<br/><br/>The film gives you an understanding of the oppressed role of women in Elizabethan England. You could really feel sorry for Viola being forced to marry a character like Wessex, just because Queen Elizabeth gave her approval - which was the same as a command. (The monarchy, at that time, was still a powerful institution - when the queen said jump, you jumped.)<br/><br/>
The business world of theater was believably portrayed, and you could understand the growth pangs of the industry. The film also demonstrated how money, in addition to Shakespeare's need to create, spurred the growth of the theater.<br/><br/>The language in the play seemed like it belonged to the era. The movie slid effortlessly between the real Shakespearean language and the pseudo-Shakespearean language the screenwriter made up. (Imagine if the film had used 20th century English; it would have been totally jarring.)<br/><br/>There were lots of in-jokes for Shakespearean fans. Check out the character holding the skull. (A homage to the grave yard scene in Hamlet.)<br/><br/>`Shakespeare in Love' had a lot of clever touches. One I really liked was the scene where the Lord of Wessex thought that Shakespeare was a ghost.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent. Colin Girth as the Lord of Wessex was a great villain. He seemed real, not just a caricature of evil. Joseph Finnes as Shakespeare was fantastic. You could really identify with him. Also, Gwyneth Paltrow was an excellent casting choice as Viola as she projected the right combination of strength and vulnerability. She was also a character one could identify with.<br/><br/>`Shakespeare in Love' is a great film. Not only is it engaging, amusing, and suspenseful, it will bring Shakespeare to everyone. Shakespeare need no longer be the aloof and mysterious topic many imagine it to be. Not that the movie will make Shakespearean English any easier to understand, but it may motivate people to take that little bit of time necessary to understand the Shakespearean text and, thus, enjoy the play. Certainly they may want to see some of the excellent film versions of Shakespeare, such as Franco Zeffirelli's `Romeo and Juliet' (1968), Zeffirelli's 1990 `Hamlet' starring Mel Gibson, and Kenneth Branagh's 1996 production of `Hamlet.'<br/><br/>
The DVD has two excellent commentaries. They are well worth listening to.<br/><br/>See this film, and you will know why it won seven academy awards."

","I know it won Best Picture and it was a terrific story with no violence or profanity, but I was a bit disappointed by this movie. It was far from bad, but it wasn't exactly what I hoped it would be. Somewhere I missed something in it, although I find it very hard to say what that exactly was. I guess the best way to describe this feeling is by saying that, because of the continuous switching between present and flash back, I wasn't completely sucked into the story this time. It broke all continuity in the story and that did bother me a bit too often. But don't get me wrong, this is still a movie that is far above average and worth watching for several reasons. One of those reasons is the acting. Gweneth, Ben, the queen....They are all very fine actors who I liked in almost every movie that I watched them play in and this movie wasn't an exception to that rule. Perhaps they aren't very well known to the average viewer who only watches commercial Hollywood toppers, but people who also like more 'alternative' movies, will certainly know their names. But next to the fine acting, this movie also offers some great scenes and images. I like the way they shot the England with its sand storms and sand dunes, but I also enjoyed the images of the English countryside. I truly believe that those images added a lot to the value of this movie and its story, which was also more than OK of course.<br/><br/>All in all this is a movie that may not be as perfect as I hoped it would be, but that still offered me a good time while watching it. I wouldn't recommend it to the people who only like war movies when there are some big fight scenes to be seen in it, because they will be very disappointed, but when you like a more alternative war movie so now and then, than this might be a good movie to watch."

The script is witty, and filled with cute, little ""inside jokes"" for those familiar with the plays and literature of Elizabethan England.<br/><br/>That being said, in my opinion there are some serious flaws, which cause it to be quite a bit inferior to other films nominated for the 98 Oscars.  Yet it is obvious that what I consider to be ""flaws,"" Hollywood considers ""virtues.""   My review is for those who find this film to be less than virtuous.<br/><br/>The only thing this film has in common with the historical Shakespeare is the name ""Shakespeare.""   This is a highly fictionalized account of his life; however, I do not consider this a flaw.   It is obvious that the writers are using Shakespeare as a vehicle to create a parable of the Hollywood film industry, complete with sex, money and psychoanalysts.  The use of Shakespeare for this end is actually quite clever.  In this day and age, where biographers feel free to inject themselves as a fictional character into the ""historical""  biographies they write, then this fictionalization of Shakespeare is par for the course.   The screenwriters also are interested in presenting a possible motivation for Shakespeare's writing of ""Romeo and Juliet:"" Shakespeare was madly in love at the time. Yet it is in the handling of the ""love"" story that I've encountered the film's most serious flaw.<br/><br/>The film's two lead characters; ""Shakespeare"" played by Joe Fiennes and ""Viola"" played be Gwyneth Paltrow; have a mutual ""love-at-first-sight"" attraction to each another.   This attraction is quickly followed up by consummation in Viola's bedroom - an activity in which the two of them engage in rather frequently throughout the course of the film.  Often they recite lines from ""Romeo and Juliet"" to each other while copulating.<br/><br/>About midway through the film, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) states ""Playwrites teach us nothing of love;  they make it pretty, they make it comical or they make it lust - they cannot make it true."" This piece of dialogue is the hinge upon which this whole film turns - and with it a wager is struck in response to the queen's  query: ""Can a play show us the very truth and nature in love?""<br/><br/>Of course a play can show us the very truth and nature in love - hence the film's thesis: the motivation behind Shakespeare's writing of ""Romeo and Juliet!""  Unfortunately, the film attempts, by association,  to take that challenge upon itself as well.  In my opinion, it fails miserably.   This is just another example of a pretty, comical, and lusty Hollywood film - nothing more.  I did not come away with an enlightened viewpoint of love and truth - rather I thought it more of a highbrow pseudo porn flick.  Sorry - two lovers reciting Shakespeare to each other while doing the horizontal bop does not bring clarity to the meaning of ""love"" to this reviewer.<br/><br/>As I stated earlier, this is not an Oscar caliber film, and didn't even deserve the nomination.  All the other nominated films were far more ambitious and told much more compelling stories.  So why then DID this film get nominated - let alone win best picture???<br/><br/>Well, one has to keep in perspective the two films before it that have won Oscars - ""The English Patient"" and ""Titanic.""   ""Shakespeare in Love"" kept lockstep with the philosophical underpinnings of those two films, and by towing the party line, endeared itself to the Hollywood elite who votes for these things.<br/><br/>""The English Patient"", ""Titanic"", and ""Shakespeare in Love"" all deal with a woman either promised to or married to a man who they either despise or find less than desirable.   Then comes along the ""love of their lives,"" and, despite the woman's engagement/marriage convenant, they go  off and embrace their ""forbidden love.""  Hence we are subtlety told that marriage/engagement is an evil that keeps one from finding true happiness.  In order for these films to work, they have to resort to times and places where woman had much less freedom of choice than they do today.  But the underlying message remains the same for all three.<br/><br/>In Hollywood USA, marriage is probably viewed in that way by many involved in the entertainment industry: a sort of ancient, masochistic custom that has outlived its usefulness.  Any film that portrays marriage as an obstacle rather than a blessing finds quite a receptive audience amongst the moral relativists who make up the film industry.  (One wonders why many entertainers even bother with marriage at all.<br/><br/>Keeping this in mind, one sees how the other films could not possibly win.<br/><br/>""Elizabeth"" shows the process by which QE1 becomes the ""virgin queen.""   If there's any subject that could be considered taboo in Hollywood, then virginity has to be it.  Hence, this film didn't have a chance.<br/><br/>`Saving Private Ryan' was a throwback to old fashioned ideas like ""duty,' ""honor,"" and worst of all, ""self-sacrifice"" - none of which play that well in modern day Southern California (except when the sacrifice of self is used for the preservation of the ""forbidden love..."")    ""The Thin Red Line"" - makes the terrible error of showing how one's adultery can have a rather negative impact on the adulterer's spouse - a concept unheard of in the land of self-indulgence without consequences.   And don't even get me started on ""Life is Beautiful....""<br/><br/>If you think that ""Shakespeare in Love"" WAS the best film of '98, then I have a few others for you to try on for size: ""Savior,"" ""Pi,"" ""Rushmore"" and ""Dark City.""  They all are far more compelling than SIL could ever hope to be."

","I watch a lot of movies.<br/><br/>For about 40 years, I ranked Spartacus as the best ever made. Literate script, brilliant acting and a story that transcended age and time. How can you go wrong with a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, direction by Stanley Kubrick and a cast that included Charles Laughton, Lawrence Olivier, Jean Simmons and Peter Ustinov? (Forget the fact that this was also the best work of Kirk Douglas - an underestimated actor - and Tony Curtis.) Then came Shakespeare In Love.<br/><br/>There is, quite simply, no better movie ever made. For one thing, it has a truly perfect script. It is a Shakespeare play, within a Shakespeare play. All of the ingredients are there. Mistaken identities. Men playing women (and a woman playing a man!) A doomed romance. A tortured artist. Sex, love, and rock and roll. Pick your metaphor. Shakespeare in Love has it.<br/><br/>The only problem this movie has, (and the only reason it isn't on IMDb's top ten) is that you have to actually have read and seen a little Shakespeare to appreciate it. This leaves out about 90% of the movie-going public, who can't even manage to shut up in the theatre, much less read a book occasionally.<br/><br/>Too bad for them."

Gwyneth Paltrow is boring, and her Shakespearean performance at the end is not dramatic at all, and very poorly done--clearly ruined the ending of what could have been spectacular.

"WhimsicalVonia","7","1","2","25 January 2014"," A Most Intelligent, Lyrical, Piquant Introduction To Shakespeare's World
","I am confident that Shakespeare In Love would be much more appreciated today had it not actually won. The primary nominees that everyone seems to believe to be the deserving winner, in this order, are: Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, or Life Is Beautiful. But mostly it is Saving Private Ryan. I am not going to digress anymore into why Shakespeare In Love did indeed win, whether it was all about politics, who really deserved it that year, etc., because it is not of any real importance. It did win, and it was a deserving film, regardless of its competition that year. <br/><br/>Shakespeare In Love tells the story of the one and only William Shakespeare; specifically, his inspiration for his greatest masterpiece, Romeo & Juliet. The year is 1593 and Shakespeare (Fiennes) is a playwright at The Rose Theater. His current play is titled ""Romeo & Ethel: The Pirate's Daughter""; it isn't going very well and he cannot seem to finish it (he even tries some mystical spell for a muse, a lady he finds in bed with another man soon thereafter). Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway, is currently residing in another city and he soon falls in love with a young maiden, Viola de Lesseps (Paltrow), whom he first sees at a performance for The Queen (Elizabeth, Dench), then at a ball. <br/><br/>Despite being unable to finish writing it, Shakespeare commences casting for his play, with the assistance of Ned Alleyn (Ben Affleck). He meets a young man with obvious talent, ""Sir Thomas Kent"". Kent is really, of course, Viola. He eventually finds out Kent's true identity and thus begins their rendezvous and love affair. <br/><br/>Alas, in the sixteenth century, their love cannot be fulfilled. Not only is William Shakespeare already married and divorce impossible, but, seemingly coincidentally, Viola is betrothed to Lord Wessex (Firth), whom everyone realizes is marrying for the de Lessep's wealth. Discovering Viola's assignations with Shakespeare, he seeks revenge. Shakespeare, himself now disguised as a girl (Viola's cousin), reveals the identity of her lover to be Christopher Marlowe, friend and rival playwright. The news of Marlowe's death (murder) causes Shakespeare much guilt, and Viola is anguished, being led to believe it is Shakespeare. She is greatly relieved to find out the truth. On opening night, Viola is able to play Juliet along Shakespeare's Romeo, despite the sexist policy of male actors only, because she is the only one available whom knows the lines. Their performance, of course, dazzles the audience. At the conclusion of a truly passionate Romeo & Juliet performance, The Master Of The Revels arrives, having discovered Kent's true identity. Kent/de Lesseps is saved by The Queen, whom, rather than reveal what she knows, stealthily lets Viola know that it is time her to marry Lord Wessex and say goodbye to ""Sir Thomas Kent"" and, therefore, Shakespeare. In one of the most poetic and tender farewell scenes, Viola and Shakespeare express their love to each other for the last time. <br/><br/>Typically, I do not like Shakespeare of any sort, be it a live play, film, book. I am not a fan of Latin and/or Elizabethan English. All the more impressive, then, that I thoroughly liked Shakespeare In Love. And it was pretty funny! It is always difficult to write an original comedy, let alone set in a different time period, in Elizabethan English! The costuming, of course, was amazing. It is always impressive to see a film that is able to transport the audience to a different era. The award- winning score was beautiful, as was set design. <br/><br/>Dench, as evidenced by her less than ten minute Academy Award winning performance, was magnificent. She was exactly how I imagine a true Queen to be: overbearing, pretentious, ostensibly bitchy, but kind-hearted when needed. Paltrow was elegant and alluring as Viola, with a performance I did not necessarily believe to be her best or even Academy Award Winning, but commendable nonetheless. Finnes was well-casted in this definitive role. Probably my favorite character, yet inexplicably under appreciated by most, is Nurse (Imelda Staunton). I loved not only how loyal and loving she was to Viola, but also watching her nervously try to cover for her, like when she was in the rocking chair as the two of them were clearly making love in the next room. Other supporting characters were also convincing. At the end of the day, however, what makes this film so deserving of its accolades, is the writing. One of the most quotable films I have seen in a while, and in such poetic, eloquent, grandiloquent words! <br/><br/>""My story starts at sea, a perilous voyage to an unknown land. A shipwreck. The wild waters roar and heave. The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces. And all the helpless souls within her drowned. All save one. A lady. Whose soul is greater than the ocean, and her spirit stronger than the sea's embrace. Not for her a watery end, but a new life beginning on a stranger shore. It will be a love story. For she will be my heroine for all time. And her name will be Viola."" <br/><br/>... And thus begins William Shakespeare's next great play, The Twelfth Night..."

It is one of my favorite films of all time, and this comes from a guy who, has acted in a lot of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>What disappoints me about the study of Shakespeare is how narrowly the ""traditionalists"" have boxed him into an acceptable academic definition. Their knowledge, while expansive, still confines them into a incestuous body of research wherein one source feeds upon another ad infinitum.<br/><br/>I prefer the broader approach taken by this film — from one of the most marvelously crafted screenplays ever — portraying Shakespeare as almost an accidental genius. And yes, the world has experienced many.<br/><br/>I haven't read all the comments on the film but can only assume that those who dislike it do so because it challenges the status quo of the Shakespeare myth and canon. Yet Shakespeare IN LOVE is not meant to be history: It's meant to be entertainment.<br/><br/>And this is what Shakespeare would have wanted."
"fatehsmann","8","1","2","21 December 2010"," The magic of the bard lives on
","I confess to perhaps giving the film a rating which it didn't quite deserve, but that's because I have a weakness for literature in general and Shakespeare in particular, and the wonderful sonnets, couplets and other verses that this film is full off probably meant that this film gets an 8 when it would have gotten a 6 or a 7.<br/><br/>This movie was the surprise hit of 1998, even going as far to win an Oscar nomination for the director John Madden. The movie depicts a young Shakespeare lacking inspiration and suffering from writers block, who's told that love will restore his gift. He then meets Viola De Lesseps, a lady of much higher social standings, who has a love for poetry and a disdain for the so-called nobility. The two are instantly attracted to each other and a love affair blossoms. Shakespeare meanwhile, get's inspiration and begins writing Romeo and Juliet. However, the conservative society of Britain in the 15th century is such that much like the play, Romeo and Juliet have little hope of being together.<br/><br/>The best part about the movie are the performances. Joseph Fiennes shows that the gift of acting is not just bestowed upon his more illustrious brother Ralph, he too has a significant share . His passion and energy seem to transmit to the entire screen. Gwyneth Paltrow was nominated for an Oscar for breathing life into Viola De Lesseps. She beautifully portrays the lovestruck lady's passions and emotions. The chemistry between the two leads is intense. The other cast members do an admirable job of supporting them, particularly Geoffery Rush whose screen presence, as usual, adds to the allure of the movie, even if he has little to do. The dialogues are worthy of a movie on a Shakespeare. Add to all this a fine storyline and you have a fine mix.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch<br/><br/>8/10"

","Watching this again after some years I find it gets even better. It's very funny, very good to look at, and has a plot which while quite over the top historically in fact tells you a lot about the greatest dramatist of all time & his age, about artistic inspiration, about love. There are so many good character actors in it, all deftly bringing their characters to life. The principals are all superb - Fiennes, Paltrow, Firth, Dench, Callow, Wilkinson, Sher, Staunton, Affleck and the rest. The death of Marlowe is moving - all the more for being off stage - and the whole theme of hopeless love is treated in a bittersweet way which is quite moving. At the end, though, it's the humour which stays with me; the sly references to our present preoccupations especially. Tom Stoppard blazed a trail years ago in ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" to the possibilities of using Shakespeare as a jumping off point; in this respect this film's a worthy successor years later."

"marcin_kukuczka","9","1","2","2 August 2009"," Passionate Love Story Within Dreamlike Inspiration
","Have you ever thought of a well known story in terms of some novelties? So to say, can the content of a movie still leave a contemporary viewer breathless? Indeed, in our age of consumption and shallow effects, it seems that true commitment to the essence of what art is supposed to be is faded. We rarely encounter any freshness in such themes like love and romance, the themes well known in cinema but frequently considered as 'prefabricated,' and, consequently, distorted, deprived of their essential vitality. A very justifiable question arises: are there still films that can really move us? If there are some, is ""Shakespeare in Love"" one of them? <br/><br/>At first, it seems that the content of this movie is rather common and predictable. It shows, in a fictitious manner, the inspiration that Shakespeare might have had during writing one of his timeless love dramas. The suggestion goes on logically as the movie calls our attention to the creative experience of love that touches the mind and heart of the playwright to write one of the most beautiful love stories, ""Romeo and Juliet"". That is the crucial link between this movie and the great masterpiece since Shakespeare is showed as the one who goes through similar love that Romeo did go through. But is this movie only a romance, a love story that raises a hero and a heroine to the very heights of blissful feelings? <br/><br/>The movie by John Madden is, foremost, a tribute to the artistic inspiration that brings back the very essence of a story on screen. It is filled with profound experience of images, scenery, music and performances. Therefore, firstly, it is a lovely movie with all its merits as a manifestation of art, and, secondly, an innovative representation of love, similarly to Shakespeare's drama that occurs to win the people, both Queen Elizabeth and her faithful subjects, as new and touching.<br/><br/>Romeo and Juliet...their dramatic, short but blissful lives are now Will (Joseph Fiennes) and Viola's (Gwyneth Paltrow) short, blissful experiences. The two give sublime performances. They are (...and it is significant to mention that here) romantically subtle and erotically sensual. Their love appears to combine the two depictions of love, or more specifically, the two aspects of love focused on: the one of Shakespeare's works and the one of modern cinema. Therefore, what we get here is a harmony between sweet youthful feeling and strong erotic desire. One cannot go without the other in order not to limit the whole merely to 'characters in bliss' or 'characters in lust.' That would, of course, condense the whole picture to mere sentimentalism or sheer eroticism. The both aspects must complement each other in order to be genuine and satisfy the ambitious movie buffs. Moreover, reference is the building block of inspiration: Juliet's balcony appears to be Viola's balcony, the proud Capulets appears to be upright Lord Wessex (Colin Firth), death appears to be a conventional separation. Yet all the differences are united by the very feeling of love beautifully depicted by Ms Paltrow and Mr Fiennes.<br/><br/>Except for the main characters, we have a wide range of different people, different personalities: the proud, the rich, the noble, the poor, the curious, the wretched; finally, the gentle and creative. Witty scenes with curious and over-caring Nurse (Imelda Staunton) who sits at the door the whole night outside the room where Will and Viola are making love are hilarious. The character of proud and rich Lord Wessex is memorably portrayed by Colin Firth who stresses one of the key poisons of human pride: selfishness. The character of John Webster (Joe Roberts) is interesting, too: it calls our attention to the young boy, partly lost in the world's glamor, who finds his entire interest and enthusiasm in brutality... Can a person totally deprived of feelings ever understand what love is? The supporting cast are also very good and in no way shadowed. They rather add their own parts into the complex realities and diverse paths of life in which a true feeling is born. Shakespeare had to have audience, contemporary people who are memorably showed here.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Shakespeare in Love"" may be considered one of the movies that still move us. I don't hesitate to claim that this film is as powerful as ""Romeo and Juliet"" must have been for its first audience since what may be more inspiring, more touching, more creative than honest feeling that illumines the lives of a young couple? What matters is not its fiction, its play but its powerful enthusiasm inspired by honest Love that will never age, nor fade, nor die."
"JamesHitchcock","8","1","2","24 September 2008"," Intelligent and witty comedy
","This film is based around a fictitious episode in the life of William Shakespeare. The year is 1593 and Shakespeare, at the age of 29 a rising young star of the Elizabethan theatre, is working on his latest play, a comedy provisionally entitled ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"". Or rather, he would be working on his play were he not suffering from a bad case of writer's block, much to the dismay of his theatre manager, Philip Henslowe, who is heavily in debt and badly needs a successful Shakespeare play to ease his financial situation.<br/><br/>Shakespeare's creative powers return when he falls in love with the beautiful Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy City merchant. Although the law at this period prevented women from acting on stage, and all female parts were taken by adolescent boys, the stage-struck Viola has ambitions to become an actor and has disguised herself as a boy in order to join Henslowe's company. When Shakespeare discovers her imposture, the two begin a passionate affair, and ""Romeo and Ethel"" gradually becomes the tragedy we know today as ""Romeo and Juliet"".<br/><br/>""Shakespeare in Love"" combines the conventions of the period costume drama with those of the romantic comedy. As is normal with rom-coms, there are several obstacles to the happiness of the young couple. Quite apart from the difference in their social status, there is the fact that Shakespeare is already married (although his wife does not actually appear in the film). Moreover, Viola is betrothed to the deeply unpleasant Earl of Wessex. (An unlikely title for a sixteenth-century nobleman. The Saxon Earldom of Wessex had been abolished after the Norman Conquest, and the expression ""Wessex"" had largely fallen into disuse; it was revived by the Victorian novelist Thomas Hardy to designate south-west England).<br/><br/>There are some similarities between this film and the more recent ""Becoming Jane"" which also dealt with an imagined romantic affair in the life of a great writer and with the effects of that supposed romance on her writing. In both cases the affair ends unhappily for the lovers, as the writers clearly did not want to rewrite the history books too much. After all, history records that Jane Austen died unmarried and that William Shakespeare was married to Anne Hathaway, not Viola de Lesseps. ""Shakespeare in Love"" is the better of the two films, largely because it has a better script. ""Becoming Jane"" is a middling period romance, whereas ""Shakespeare"" is an intelligent and very witty comedy, as one might expect from the pen of Tom Stoppard, one of Britain's wittiest and most intelligent playwrights. Stoppard and his co-writer Mark Norman have produced a script that is not only amusing but also very perceptive, both about artistic creativity and about love. There are a number of in-jokes for scholars of literature, including a new theory about the murder of Christopher Marlowe. Another famous dramatist, John Webster, makes an appearance, ""much possessed by death"" (in Eliot's phrase) even as a boy.<br/><br/>The film, which stars numerous leading lights of the British acting profession, is not only well written but also well acted. My old history teacher used to complain about ""Bardolatry"", which he defined as ""the belief that Shakespeare is the second-best thing to God"". He would have been pleased by Joseph Fiennes' interpretation of the role, not as the semi-divine Immortal Bard but as a very recognisable human being- young, ardent, passionate, but also with some very human flaws. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as the much put-upon Henslowe, as is Colin Firth (cast against type as a villain) as the odious Wessex.<br/><br/>The film won a number of Oscars, not all of which I would agree with. ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"" was well-deserved, but I cannot see that Judi Dench really deserved ""Best Supporting Actress"" for her brief eight-minute cameo as Queen Elizabeth I. Perhaps the Academy were trying to make up to her for having overlooked her much more substantial role as another monarch, Queen Victoria, in ""Mrs Brown"" the previous year. Gwyneth Paltrow, who won ""Best Actress"", makes an attractive and lovable heroine, but this was not really an Oscar-class performance when compared to Cate Blanchett in ""Elizabeth"" or Emily Watson in ""Hilary and Jackie"". As for ""Best Picture"", my vote would have been for a film that, in the event, was not even nominated. ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a good film, but Peter Weir's ""The Truman Show"" is a truly great one. 8/10"

"Muskox53","10","1","2","5 July 2007"," Close to perfection!
","Marc Norman is credited as a co-author of this screenplay, but it feels like Tom Stoppard's worki.e. it's rich, astonishingly rich, with at least four different interacting levels all going on at the same time.<br/><br/>#1: Most ostensibly, it's a romanticized biography of the early turning point in Shakespeare's careerthe writing of his first indisputably great play (Romeo and Juliet), the passing of the theatrical torch from Christopher Marlowe to him, and his joining of the Chamberlain's Men, which cost him 50 pounds (an enormous figure in those days). Lots of known facts are changed, much is invented, but the overall sense is pretty reasonableand about as accurate as the typical film biography.<br/><br/>#2: It's a delightful fiction about a romance between Will Shakespeare and the wealthy Viola de Lessups, who is engaged to be married to the haughty but impoverished Lord Wessexa romance that inspires him to write Romeo and Juliet, largely because it plays out as a kind of mirror of that very play. Or a pre-mirror, since it isn't written yet. The ball, the balcony, the duel, the suitor, the nurse, the three appearances of the Prince of Verona (i.e. Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth)...it's all there. One of the joys for the audience who knows the play is recognizing all the anticipations embedded in the filmplus a few from other plays (like Banquo's ghost) for good measure.<br/><br/>#3: The film delivers in the most persuasive possible way a strong critical reading of the play Romeo and Juliet. It has been observed by many critics that this play begins as a traditional comedy, with all the stock figures and stereotypes, but halfway through (exactly halfway!) with the deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt, it turns into a tragedy, and then systematically reinterprets all the comedic scenes and characters of the first half in this newly tragic light. Stoppard's story of the writing of the play begins with Will, ecstatic with love, finally getting started on the comedy he's been promising his producer...but as the love affair with Viola darkens, his ability to sustain the comic mood disappears. At exactly the halfway point of the film, he wakes next to Viola and announces that ""I found something in my sleep. It's not a comedy I'm writing any more, it's a tragedy!""<br/><br/>#4: Finally, this is a tribute to the joys of the theatreto acting, to writing, to producing, to simply hanging around getting enchanted by it all. A central character here is Mr. Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), who begins as a heartless money-man who looks to the theatre as a possibly lucrative investment, and ends up transformed; to his own surprise, perhaps, he now cares more about something other than about profit. Many of the most delightful parts of the film are part of this fun: the verbal anachronisms (playing the Palace, the show must...go on), and especially the sexual role-reversals (at rehearsals, Juliet is played by a boy dressed as a girl, and Romeo by a girl dressed as a boy). Several central scenes involve quick cuts back and forth between rehearsals and Will and Viola making love...using the same lines, even though Will most of the time says Juliet's and Viola Romeo's.<br/><br/>Are there any flaws? Perhaps Paltrow's readings as Romeo are not as compelling as they could have been...and she never really persuades us that she's British, though as Viola she is radiant and passionate. Ben Affleck is also an odd choice for Ned, and he performs ""a plague on both your houses"" rather badly...though he does project great authority and confidence. Joseph Fiennes, who single-handedly energizes the film and is brilliant in a long demanding role, is the real star...and he, Geoffrey Rush, and Colin Firth are all magnificent. What a disgrace that Fiennes wasn't even nominated for a Best Actor Oscar!"

","This has been a film i have wanted to see on and off for some time, and today i finally got a chance to watch it! Though I had waited some time to see this film, my expectations of it weren't extremely high; i expected it to be a light hearted romantic comedy, however i was very, very impressed. The performances were excellent, both Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Afflecks English accents were flawless, as were everyone's performances, and they really brought Romeo and Juliet to life. i thought it was cleverly directed, and well thought through, resulting in maximum laughs and also maximum tears. Though this is essentially a romantic comedy, it is genuinely touching, and has some truly tear jerking moments. I was expecting to enjoy watching this film once, and then not miss it if i never saw it again, however i will definitely be keeping hold of this one, as i know I will want to see it many more times. I myself am not a particular fan of Shakespeare, or anything set before the nineteenth century really, but this blew me away, and i am proud to have seen it. whether or not you like Shakespeare, this film is just plain brilliant, and will leave with a big sad smile on your face, and maybe even a couple of wet eyes. genius."

","Young playwright William Shakespeare struggles with his latest work ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"". A great fan of Shakespeare's plays is young, wealthy Viola who is about to be married to the cold-hearted Lord Wessex, but constantly dreams of becoming an actress. Women were not allowed to act on stage at that time (female roles were played by men, too), but dressed up as a boy, Viola successfully auditions for the part of Romeo. Soon she and William are caught in a forbidden romance that provides rich inspiration for his play.<br/><br/>This film is very fictional. Perhaps you might already know that (I just wanted to point that out). You know I hated the play ""Romeo and Juliet"" but I thought I'd give this movie a chance, since, it's not a play. Instead, I was wrong. This movie is largely based on Romeo and Juliet, which I've already seen two different versions of it already.<br/><br/>Well, I didn't mind seeing a new version of that play. In fact, I actually liked it for the first time because William's events that happened in his life actually inspired his plays! In my opinion, that's just awesome! The costume designs in this film is great, as you can expect from any Shakespeare adaption, and the production design is also great.<br/><br/>If you've read or seen the play Romeo and Juliet, you might have a very fun time in this movie like I did because you know what happens before anyone else does! I liked the acting by Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow, which both have great chemistry (not to mention this is Paltrow's first film in which I saw her breasts, not to be perverish or anything).<br/><br/>I wasn't a Shakespeare fan, but now, I truly like his work after seeing this fictional film. This film is fantastic from beginning to end, earning it an Oscar for Best Picture! Don't care about any historical accuracies and you'll love this as much as me!"

","Whether there is an iota of truth in this film (it's very doubtful there is), it is a wonderful creation. It sets the bards longing in the Elizabethan period, where life was short, theatre was king, and competition for attention was everywhere. Christopher Marlowe was no Shakespeare, and he met a tragic death, so let's see what happens when you throw the two together. Take all the lessons about the period and the Globe, have those young boys playing female parts. Have Shakespeare riding a roller coaster of depression. Take Gwyneth Paltrow's character, absolutely stunning. Throw them into the hopper and let it happen. Many more articulate people can comment with a great deal more scholarship than I have.

And later on when I found out about the original rating for this movie here in my country, I became flabbergasted. I wasn't even of age when this movie came out here.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I still survived watching the movie anyway.<br/><br/>William Shakespeare (played by Joseph Fiennes) was trying to write this play he has been writing on. He has run out of ideas and is desperately needing of money. Then Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) appeared and the two began a forbidden relationship, given Lady Viola is betrothed to Lord Wessex (Colin Firth). Viola actually became Shakespeare's muse for the eventual play which is maybe one of the most famous ones in our time - Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>Some may wondered why guys have to dress up as women in plays in Shakepseare's time because at that time, women were actually not allowed on stage. But Lady Viola violated the rules at a great cost, given she did knew of the consequences.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not what maybe some are expecting of a biography of Shakespeare's life. It's just a love story. I do actually like Queen Elizabeth's (Dame Judi Dench) appearance too. Or maybe it's because I'm one of those who are always fascinated over history. And maybe even literature as well.<br/><br/>Nice movie over there."

However, having recently watched the film again i was pleasantly surprised at how entirely pleasant this unassuming film was,easy and compatible to watch on a Friday night, knowing that you will leave content and at ease. Granted, the performance of Paltrow to me was as dire as her acceptance speech at the Oscars, but then the role didn't require the acting of a prima donna. The best thing that i found in the play was the sense of a company of actors, none of whom wanted to stand out, making this film a unequally, solid, collective performance throughout the entirety of this picture. Having said this; Dench gave a stirring and realistic performance of Queen Elizabeth I, while Ben Afleck performed well, without overdoing the nature of the bold character, leaving it to be unrealistic. To conclude, do not expect a life changing film that will alter your views on the world, for you will not get it.

","Shakespeare in Love is a historical film for people who don't like historical films. It's free of the weight this kind of movies usually carry, and full of brisk, engaging comedy as well as painstaking tragedy. The pace never once slows down. In short, it has some of the best qualities of Shakespeare's plays.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow shows surprising range, Joseph Fiennes is more than eye-candy, and the rest of the all-star cast, especially the great Judi Dench, handle the complicated plot with admirable ease. It looks like the film was fun to shoot, and that makes the viewer feel good as well.<br/><br/>And here comes the spoiler: the ending, despite being unhappy, is one of the most stylish finales Hollywood has seen in the past few years. The approach on Viola and Will's sadness is incredibly light-hearted and smooth. You will leave the movie house with a smile on your face, not weeping for the main couple's cruel destiny.<br/><br/>However, Shakespeare in Love is not a masterpiece (hence seven stars only). What it lacks is the director's ""signature style"", the unique touch of an auteur. Could it be that John Madden simply doesn't have one? His craftsmanship is admirable, but he's no Cukor."

","The first time I viewed Shakespeare In Love, it was a romantic evening, and I think I got lucky. At my age, I don't always remember.

For us fellows that have taken up the pen, Shake is a hero, and we're more than willing to imagine our less talented egos upon the master; therefore, making our pathetic literary dreams come true for at least ninety minutes.<br/><br/>The second time around on DVD, ah, a popular Academy Award Winner it still is, but I had more reservations. You see, I began to desire the real thing. I wanted to see the actual play. I loved the set of the old Curtain Playhouse. I wanted to see Romeo and Juliet as the 1946, Olivia production, Henry V, had duplicated a Globe presentation.<br/><br/>The problem, a lesser farce has been pinned to a great work of art. It's not the writer, Tom Stoppard's fault. I panned his Brazil, but I give him marks for a clever recreation of olden times and a romanticized Shakespeare, interesting.<br/><br/>Oh, Paltrow's hair, long and flowing in her family mansion, short, boy cut on stage, I don't get it.

"FloatingOpera7","7","1","2","13 February 2005"," Hollywood Takes On Shakespeare
","I am a huge fan of Shakespeare, far more so than the shallow, superficial world of Hollywood glamor. But Shakespeare on film is inevitable- Zefferelli's 1991 Hamlet starring Mel Gibson, the 1994 Much Ado About Nothing with Kenneth Branaugh, Zefferelli's Romeo And Juliet the 1968 Zefferelli film as well as Taming of The Shrew with Elizabeth Taylor, Roman Polanski's 1971 Macbeth, Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, etc. In 1998, this movie won Best Picture and numerous other awards. It is even a movie that is shown to students in high school to further understand what Shakespeare was all about.<br/><br/>I must say that it does not really do this. It's pure fiction, a Harlequin romance novel made into a movie starring appealing and rather famous actors- Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare, Gwyneth Paltrow as the fictional character of Viola, Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, Colin Firth as Lord Wessex and Ben Affleck in a minor role as one of the actors in the Company. Let me start by stating that I felt Ben Affleck had no place in this movie. What was the point ? His character was underdeveloped and it seemed he was in the film only because of his involvement with Gwyneth Paltrow or to appear in a more ""serious"" film, in an efforts to win some kind of recognition. Gwyneth Paltrow is the same kind of actress. While she does contemporary films/thrillers, she sneaks in a ""period piece"" or two. As Viola, she is wooden and flat, a romantic heroine straight out of a bodice-ripper paperback romance novel. She puts in no serious dramatic power. She only dresses as a man to perform on stage only to be near her lover Shakespeare not to make a feminist comment on how women were not allowed to act in the theater at this time. Joseph Fiennes as a young Shakespeare is well-done though and the music is gorgeous. But all this, we must remember, is fiction. Queen Elizabeth's intervention in the movie is also made up. Judi Dench does not look like Queen Elizabeth. She made a more convincing Queen Victoria in ""Mrs. Brown"", looking exactly like her too. However, Shakespeare in Love makes for a good Valentines Day movie. The ending is always very touching. Viola becomes the inspiration for the Bard's next comedy....Twelfth Night."
"kampfschweinhenrik","5","1","2","1 February 2005"," Shakespeare in Love
","The movie ""Shakespeare in love"" directed by John Madden was nominated for thirteen Oscars and did finally receive this famous award in seven different categories. The plot, as you might know, is not about one of Shakespeare's plays. It's about the circumstances which influenced Shakespeare while he was writing his play ""Romeo and Ethel, The Pirats daughter"" (later: Romeo and Juliet). The setting of this movie is in London in 1593 and follows the trials and tribulations of Will(iam) Shakespeare (played by Joseph Fiennes), a young playwright suffering because he has got a writer's block. No matter how hard he tries, he just can't make any progress with his latest work, ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter."" Somehow, even the title doesn't sound quite right. But then, Will meets and falls instantly in love with the beautiful Viola who becomes an actor (in a time when women were not allowed to perform in theaters), disguises herself as a man. Inspired by love, Will's creative powers are set free and his great love story, ""Romeo and Juliet,"" is born. The play alters with the ""ups and downs"" of their relationship. But if their love will have a happy ending, you have to find out by yourself. Although this plot is not based on a true story, the director was able to create such a realistic setting that the audience might think that the play ""Romeo and Juliet"" was really created in this way. But all in all this movie is just another love-story which was simply overrated by the Oscar-jury. I do not think that this movie was worth to gain seven Oscars. But if you like 16th century love-stories, you shouldn't miss this movie. <br/><br/>So far."

","For those who remember being forced to endure Shakespeare at school as a dusty, dry and thoroughly tedious affair, Shakespeare in Love is the film to change your mind! From start to finish, the film is colourful and captivating, and the audience is made quite aware of the tongue-in-cheek attitude with which it has been made. There are light-hearted references throughout regarding Shakespeare and his contemporaries, but even if you are a complete Shakespeare ignoramus, this won't hinder your enjoyment.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes is stunning as the besotted Will Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola convincingly balances the fine line between genteel Elizabethan Lady and feisty young woman. Supporting roles by Judi Dench, Geoffrey Rush and Tom Wilkinson add some excellent comedy touches. The performance of Romeo and Juliet within the film itself is the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>I would equate the experience of watching SiL to watching a live theatrical performance - you are whisked away in a world of colour and splendour for 2 hours and you almost don't want to leave. I adore this movie (in case you hadn't noticed) and recommend it as pure escapism for anyone."

All the cast is excellent, incl. Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow, who never struck me as a very interesting actress, rises with this excellent material and delivers the best performance of her career, quite on par with, say, Imogen Stubbs' portrayal of Viola in Trevor Nunn's near-perfect Twelfth Night (1996).<br/><br/>Shakespeare In Love is a marvelously clever and literary feel-good movie that can be watched again many times.

Viola of course eventually inspires the great play 'Twelfth Night' and, it is surmised, kick-starts the greatest creative period in Shakespeare's writing career.

","""Shakespeare in Love"" was most certainly the best film of 1998. Brilliantly acted, beautifully photographed, refreshingly free of trendy special effects for the sake of special effects, and conveying genuine human emotion, it is what the best movies have always been about.<br/><br/>Written, Directed, Produced and performed with obvious care if not love, this film addresses the intellect and the emotions as did the bard himself. Shakespeare would have approved of this paean to love and literature.<br/><br/>
It is incredibly accurate historically with one important exception. Christopher Marlowe was not killed in a mere tavern brawl. Indeed, the ""official"" story of Marlowe's death alleges that one Ingram Frizer killed Marlowe in self-defense as the two men argued over the ""bill"" or the ""reckoning"" as it was called at the time. But there is more to the story than that. It was not a tavern but a government ""safe house"" owned by Eleanor Bull who had connections to Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth I's master spy. Marlowe himself was known to have been in Walsingham's employ and had been since his Cambridge days. Marlowe was a spy.<br/><br/>
A number of scholars have raised compelling questions about the suspicious nature of Marlowe's death and have raised the possibility that he was murdered that night in Deptford. Shakespeare, himself, seemed to have been less than happy with the official coroner's report: ""When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room."" --William Shakespeare, ""As You Like It"".<br/><br/>Clearly, this is a reference to Marlowe, his verses, and his death ""...in a little room"" in Deptford in 1593.<br/><br/>""Shakespeare in Love"" is wittily rich in fact and allusion. Discerning audiences will appreciate it."

It has humor, pathos, good jokes, a love story or two, competent acting, and a bit with a dog. There is a sense that you are actually witnessing the creation of modern playwriting (which is what Romeo and Juliet was) and intruding on the very private lives of those who made it happen.  Fiennes is marvelous as Will Shakespeare, giving the myth some substance; he wasn't always revered and honored as he is today.  Paltrow is perfect as Viola. (I simply cannot even imagine Julia Roberts in this part. I'm truly glad the financing fell through when it did.)  But it is the supporting cast that tweaks this film into the piece of art that it is. Imelda Staunton has long been one of my favorites and she shines as the Nurse who allows Viola to discover who she really is.  Geoffrey Rush steals every scene he appears in (and I often use his line ""It's a mystery"" when explaining the world to my film students). Tom Wilkinson's transformation from crass businessman to a lover of the theater is not only touching, but so well acted that you almost don't notice how great that transformation is. And Ben Afleck out ""Callowing"" Simon Callow is both fun to watch and compare.<br/><br/>Editing, direction, art direction, music, actors, and top-notch writing all come together to form a film that is much greater than the sum of its parts. This is, in my opinion, a perfect film."

The main characters are Joseph Fiennes as William Shakespeare, who is a handsome man, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Lady Fiona, a pretty and blond woman. This superb romantic, comedy and historical film was filmed in England and it happened in 1590. The film is about how Shakespeare finds the inspiration he has lost, to write Romeo and Ethel the pirate's daughter. He meets Lady Viola, with whom he falls in love, although she was engaged with a man called Lord Wessex. While they live an amazing and strong romance, he is writing the sonnets to the play. The plot changes from a comedy to a stunning drama. They read together feeling as if they are Romeo and Juliet. One day the Queen knows about the relationship and orders to Lord Wessex to marry her (Viola) as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they got married on the same day of the show time of the play. But on this day the main characters get ill and the only people who really know the script are both of them: Will and Lady Viola, so as the phrase says, "" the show has to continue"" they do it. The play was a box office hit. As I'm concerned it is my favorite film, The costumes are amazing and the scenery is exactly as those times.For me it is a comedy, drama and romantic-love story.

"patdell","Null","1","2","13 March 2002"," The Bard would be rolling in his grave over this twee romp.
","Seven Oscars(tm)? How could the Academy have got it so wrong?<br/><br/>The first, and most crucial failing of Shakespeare in Love (SinL) is that it attempts to set a love story against Romeo and Juliet, the greatest love story in English literature. What we are presented with is a twee excuse to throw around some clever' Shakespearian allusions from terribly boring characters in a film which ultimately offers no genuine insights for the audience.<br/><br/>The first hour of SinL rolls on happily enough and I was eager to play along with the notion that The Bard's inspiration for Romeo and Juliet came from his own lovelorn life. But then it dawned on me. There is nothing actually being delivered. The gags are forced. The ham-fisted direction clearly telegraphs plot progression so any tension is lost. Which leaves us, poor viewer, with the romantic musings between Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow as aristocratic Viola De Lesseps.<br/><br/>These two spend an enormous amount of time spouting Shakespeare-lite' dialogue to each other that will make even the most strong of stomach feel queasy. The only real respite comes from two lame swordfights that come so out of the blue as to be just irrelevant swash-buckling.<br/><br/>Fiennes brings only two facial expressions to his role in SinL: Wide-eyed and worried and wide-eyed and besotted. Paltrow offers a little more and exhibits some flashes of passion. Dame Judi Dench, however, is a high-camp parody of Queen Elizabeth. The only real use she and her character provide is delivery of a conclusion to try and desperately wrap up this lame gambol. Lets not even mention Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>As for the depiction of Elizabethan England hailed in other reviews, does it occur to anyone that we only see two city' streets? A vision of sprawling, plaque-ridden London this does not make. Indeed, the two theatres in which many scenes are set are clearly the same set, only one with a little more aesthetic trimming. Yawn.<br/><br/>However, even this jaded viewer suddenly found himself engaged by SinL. Finally, Romeo and Juliet gets performed and we get a few tantalising scenes from the play. I must admit my spine tingled. But what does that say when the best parts of a film were written four hundred years ago.<br/><br/>The film does nothing to dispel the cliche notion either of Shakespeare being the domain of men in tights but it will hopefully whet the appetite of the uninitiated. <br/><br/>Otherwise, forget this nonsense and wrap your eyes around the real deal. Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet is an excellent presentation of the play in a contemporary setting and is hugely entertaining. Something Shakespeare in Love falls way short of."
"crawfo","6","1","2","25 January 2002"," Not bad but too swashbuckling near the end to be credible
","Well-crafted film with plenty of scenic verisimilitude and historical references, such as to stagecraft and theatrical customs of the time. Well-written script, and easy-to-take morsels of Shakespeare for the uninitiated.  Judy Dench, who got the best lines (and an Oscar) didn't look the least bit like Queen Elizabeth, however.  And Joseph Fiennes was miscast: long narrow face and too much the Hollywood or Pinewood male screen idol of the 20th century.  And it's quite incredible that Shakespeare, an actor and writer, would take on an experienced soldier in mortal combat, and even less credible that he would fight him off.  This must have been devised for the American audience who, film-makers now seem to think, have to have a fight-scene near the end of a film or they won't go to it.  Is that really true?"
"rmax304823","Null","1","2","28 January 2002"," Exeunt Educated
","You can't help wondering how Shakespeare managed it.  In 26 years he produced 37 plays, three epic poems, and all those sonnets, on top of which he was an actor and prosperous businessman.  I would be hard put to type everything he wrote in those years using a quill pen and pot of ink.  The haste sometimes shows.  His plots are often weak and derivative and suffer excessively from what Ebert calls the idiot plot syndrome, in which characters do the stupidest things just to keep the story hopping.  When King Lear asks his daughters how much they love him, Cordelia's one-sentence answer is misunderstood and sets the whole tragedy in motion, though the problem could be solved with a few additional words.  Whole chunks of dialogue in Julius Caeser are shamelessly ripped off from Plutarch.  But the poetry is a different matter, resonant, finely constructed, and sometimes ethereal.  Well, this movie is, in short, the story of how WS came to write Romeo and Juliet, chiefly it seems by integrating bits of his personal life into the mosaic of the play.  He overhears someone on the street yelling, ""A plague on both your houses,"" and so on.  And the movie is filled with amusing anachronistic expressions.  Actors say ""break a leg"" to one another, and they say things like ""boobies"" and ""dip your wick"" and ""we'll be put in the clink.""  It's not jarring because none of this fairy tale is supposed to be realistic.  <br/><br/>Basically there are two ways a movie about a period classic can go.  (1) There is the elegant way.  Everyone wears immaculate clothes and speaks a sort of perfumed English; vide Olivier.  (2)  There is the dirty way, the route this movie takes, in which characters may be sweaty and vulgar, get into slapstick brawls in the mud, use barely interpretable dialects, and bump into things.  The actors here do a nice job along their naturalistic way.  The dialogue is written in such a way as to suggest the author just finished reading the bard's collected works in one sitting.  WS is clean cut and handsome, though he has inky fingernails.  Paltrow, as Viola, uses an irreproachable English accent and impresses with her lanky body and her sharply boned, slightly asymmetrical face, although she too must brush her teeth and spit.  One also looks forward to the appearance of even the most minor supporting players.  And Judy Dench as QE I is a standout, coiffed like an escapee from Coppola's Dracula.<br/><br/>If there is a problem it's that it helps to understand the film if you are a fan of Shakespeare.  I don't mean that you necessarily like the film more, just that you understand it better.  Then you know why Marlowe is such a pain as far as WS is concerned, and why Burbage makes such a stir when he enters the theater for the first time, and why the rival theatrical troupes enact so realistically the Donnybrook between the Capulet and the Montague boys.  I could tell there were a lot of allusions that were getting past me. No matter.  There is verisimilitude enough that you finish viewing the film a more educated person than before.<br/><br/>What a place Elizabethan London must have been if you could somehow set aside the plague, the smallpox, the outhouses, the poverty and starvation and odor and other such quibbles.  Along these streets, at the same time, strode people like Queen Elizabeth, Condell, Burbage, Thomas Kyd, Marlowe, Sir Francis Drake, Frobisher -- every English-speaking person who was anybody at the time, it seems.  This film, a mixture of fact and plausible fantasy, is pretty enjoyable."

","While this film has an extraordinary performance by Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth the first and an hilarious performance by Geoffrery Rush the movie itself is scrambled. What is it? Comedy, Drama, Porn, I don't know. Joseph Fiennes is mediocre as William Shakespeare, he was better in ""Elizabeth."" Gwyneth Paltrow while she was excellent in ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" here she is nothing, who is she, who is her character. Her character is underwritten. There is a rediculous scene after a character dies involving Joseph Fiennes pointing at Colin Firth. The script by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman is just a jumble. Judi Dench and Geoffrey Rush lift this film to a 5 on a one to 10 scale."
"reedmilder","7","1","2","25 March 2001"," Does not hold up to the test of time.
","I did not want to like this film when I first watched it.  I was a little bitter from the Oscars, feeling that both Private Ryan and Thin Red Line had to be better.  I was surprised to find that although I did indeed like the two previous films better, Shakespeare in Love was a terrific film. It was witty, stylish and had an excellent script.  I could understand how it could have won Best Picture.  Today, I can no longer say that.  Upon repeated viewings, it simply does not remain a great film.<br/><br/>The witty reparte is no longer as witty the 2nd, 3rd and 4th viewings. In fact, Geoffrey Rush becomes rather annoying and absolutely unbelievable. Private Ryan and Thin Red Line are excellent each time I watch them because there is true art going on.  Shakespeare is simply an entertaining story that gets old fast.  Saving Private Ryan was clearly robbed of the Best Picture.  Oh well, it will simply join Citizen Kane, Psycho, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Shawshank Redemption and numerous other films that have clearly outlasted the films which beat them out.  Shakespeare in Love is a good film, don't get me wrong(7/10).  Fiennes is terrific and Paltrow is passable.  It simply is not the film Private Ryan is.  I think that was clear in 1998, but it is undeniable in 2001.  If you would like to see real Shakespearian drama, check Branagh's full-length version of Hamlet."
"Rishi","7","1","2","31 December 1998"," Clever, sappy
","In this ""historical"" movie, Shakespeare is imagined as a young playwright in England falling in love with nobility, which prompts him to write Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about the movie were the references to Shakespeare's other plays and his time period. For example, when Shakespeare sits down in the psychiatrist's chairs, he's thinking about ""words, words, words"" (a reference to Hamlet). Also, Shakespeare talks to a young boy who loves blood and finds his name to be John Webster (writer of ""The Duchess of Malfi"" and other plays).<br/><br/>However, though the few references were quite clever, I didn't really feel there were enough of them. Though many of the jokes would be lost on a lot of the audience, fans of Shakespeare would really appreciate them.<br/><br/>Also, I think the movie shifted from being a clever period comedy with biting satire into a sappy love story and then leaves me with a mixed feeling at the end (in some ways, following the progression of Shakespeare's own plays.) Still, the sap does get a bit overwhelming at times. Rating: 7."

","As Ned Alleyn (Ben Affleck) and the Admiral's men prepare to perform their production of Romeo and Juliet, Ned tells ""the money"", Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson), ""Pay attention, and you will see how genius creates a legend."" The same could have been said to any extras, cast, or crew on the set of ""Shakespeare in Love."" The movie covers a little more than three weeks in the life of the bard (Joseph Fiennes).  He has writers' block, but the moneylender Fennyman will kill, or perhaps cut off the nose of, Philip Henslowe, who is expecting the play ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" to be finished yesterday. After an affair with Rosalind, Richard Burbage's seamstress, goes bad, he finally finds his muse in Viola de Lessaps (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The daughter of a wealthy ex-shopkeeper, she is betrothed to marry Lord Wessex (an especially dastardly Colin Firth) after her parents return from the country in three weeks.  In the meantime, however, she dresses like a man and adopts the name of Thomas Kent to play the part of Romeo. I was at first miffed by the use of Shakespeare's most famous, but not greatest, play for this movie, but given the inside jokes and parallels, I quickly forgave.  ""I say a plague upon both their houses..."" a religious fanatic says to a crowd, preaching against acting.  After a night of lovemaking, Viola and Will argue about whether or not it was, in fact, the rooster or the owl they just heard.  Perhaps the most clever inside joke is the character John Webster, as an eager boy whose favorite part of the play was when Juliet stabbed herself.  Few viewers would know that he will grow up to become one of the next generation of English playwrites, famous for his use of blood and violence. The movie has beautiful cinematography, and even more beautiful and unrealistic language.  ""Love knows nothing of rank, or riverbanks."" Will says, arguing with Thomas Kent.  ""This is not life, Will, it is a stolen season."" says Viola.  She's right--but what a beautiful stolen season it is."

For anyone who loves Shakespeare, literature, or the theater, this film is a celebration of that world.  It is not a cliche - I can't think of any other film that similarly glorifies the fascinating world of the playhouse and the genius of the greatest playwright in history.  We are transported back to Elizabethan England to experience what it must have been like to witness Shakespeare performed for the first time, and it is an exhilarating experience.

","An entertaining, ultimately shallow, yet well-meaning film, whose numerous verbal anachronisms can be forgiven for its sheer sense of fun. Joseph Fiennes makes for a goofy, doe-eyed Bard, and Paltrow (as his Muse) seems to fit the Elizabethan period well, although aside from her fashionable looks, Gwyneth's acting has little to recommend itself for. <br/><br/>Most of all, the screenplay deals with the world of Theatre, the whole writing/production/staging process, here presented in a freespirited manner that at times rings true, but again, is all too superficial. Obvious visual inconsistencies irritate the eye (notably the mysterious accommodation of Paltrow's sumptuous hair under her tiny boyish disguise-wig ),but not enough to ruin the whole show. Perhaps the movie's biggest saving grace is that it rarely slows down, aside from the obligatory love scenes. Of course, the sex here is overdone and glossed over almost unbearably, but not as bad as in most mainstream genre pieces. If anything, it demonstrates that Miramax is truly no longer an ""indie"" studio: it has fully accepted all of Hollywood's conventions and restraints. <br/><br/>Also, SIL is notable for the second portrayal of Elizabeth I in '98: (this time around she's in her waning years ), probably in her best known context: exuding royal patronage on Shakespeare; a brief, yet definitive performance by Dench, fresh from playing Victoria in '97."

Though I must say that the acting, directing, costumes and plot of the film were intelligently put together, I was nevertheless disappointed with the kind of ""passion"" that was portrayed in this film.  ""Passion"" IS NOT sex.  It is a fusion of love and desire.  In this movie, I saw the two main characters ""go at it"" because of this strong PHYSICAL attraction.  I'm not sure this is the kind of message we should sent to our society today.  As much as I am displeased with this film, I must say the writers were incredible and they did an absolutely amazing job of piecing everything together.

She is a gorgeous young woman and a great actress. I first rented the tape to check it out because I don't have the patience to watch those endless movies more than once.

Many times a movie gets many Oscars but becomes a sleepy movie in my movie collection or a sleepy rental. But this movie is one for the movie-buff collection!  There is much to be digested after one watches it many times.<br/><br/>Viola and Will made a lovely pair. Too bad there is never a happy ending for Romeo and Juliet movies, it would be nice if at least one had a happy ending. The script is brilliant,  composed of interwoven stories, the rhythm of the poetry, the photography, the actors acting in two levels: as actors in the play ""Romeo and Juliet"" and as the characters in the movie. It is just outstanding. This is a rare gem of a movie. Favorite scenes: Will running after Viola in the street and finding out that the he is a she. The love scenes are beautifully done, the nurse and her little fan sitting outside the bedroom and making noise with her rocking chair. Any time Viola reads poetry was lovely.  Gwyneth makes reading poetry look easy, but it is not easy. Her sense of timing and her British accent are impeccable. Favorite Quotes: Lord Wessex: ""I have spoken to your father.""  Viola: ""I speak to him every day, sir.""   [Whispering at Viola's bedroom door] Nurse: ""Madame, the house is stirring. It is a new day.""  Viola: ""It is a new WORLD."""

If you study the composition of the closing shot, you'll see that the credits{text, language,} are superimposed over the treeline in the middle ground,  while the strolling figure of the Muse {Viola} traverses the barren sands {chaos}. If Shakespeare is considered as the great organizer of experience, then this scene invests his works with an organic fecundity that resonates throughout the ensuing historical attempts of war and capitalistic endeavors to stave off the inevitabile triumph of Thanantos.

","A story about young playwright Will Shakespeare, who after years of works creates a masterpiece: Romeo And Juliet. A love story that makes his name remembered. The idea is brilliant, but the result is something entirely different. The movie focuses all too much on Romeo And Juliet, maybe because a couple of years back the new version of the play was released and gained huge respect among people everywhere. This was the most critical mistake the movie crew made. The brilliant idea for a movie was spoiled by excessive Romeo And Juliet- scenes, because now anyone who has seen Romeo And Juliet has really nothing to see in Shakespeare In Love. The sentence ""Additional dialogue by William Shakespeare"" in the movie credits should have been replaced with ""Dialogue mainly by William Shakespeare"". The main theme in the movie is the making of Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet, and the secondary theme is a regular predictable love story between Shakespeare's and actress Viola De Lesseps. This movie has nothing special to offer, and is not even all that amusing (as a comedy is expected to be). The fact that this totally common movie, with a plot exactly like all comedy flavored love stories through history won the Oscar for the best movie, is beyond my understanding. Gwyneth Palthrow's performance is not bad at all, but hardly worth an Oscar, either. The only bright spot in the movie is Shakespeare's brilliant dialogue, and that proves the lack of imagination by the writers."

","I myself do not like the films of this type, but I went to see it cause of my girlfriend.  Well, it was better then I expected. First part of the movie is a parody on comedy.  Looks OK, but is a bit boring.  The second half of the film is a real drama. The thing I enjoyed the most was the performance of the artists. Great job.  Without them, it could have been a dead movie."
"Movie Mac","7","1","2","21 May 1999"," A brilliant movie that should never have won Best Picture at the Oscars.
","I had seen 'Saving Private Ryan'. I went into the theatre thinking to myself; ""If this movie beat 'Saving Private Ryan' then it must be incredible!!"". As I watch the movie, I am greeted by some of the best acting I have seen in a movie. A brilliant cast with Judi Dench and Geoffrey Rush as standouts. They really stole the show! (A little more time with them would have been nice.) I liked Gwyneth Paltrow, partly because I am a 16 year-old male, and partly because I have seen her in other movies and I have been a slight fan. The screenplay was incredible! You were really made to think that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet that way! Directing was great. Not a Spielberg by any means, but still good. The sets, the costumes, the sound everything was there! I had a great time watching it...yet I couldn't help but think afterwards that I had been hoodwinked.<br/><br/>I was racking my brains trying to think about the little problem, that minor issue that annoyed me about this movie. I kept thinking to myself; ""What am I on about? It was a great movie, brilliant in all respects. What on Earth is it???"". Then it hit me, and I don't think anybody has picked this up about it. The pace.<br/><br/>The movie was almost like a Shakespeare play in itself and Shakespeare plays are meant to be taken at a slow pace so that you can understand what is going on. I felt as if after I watched it I still hadn't seen it. It stopped right at the point it should have started. I suppose I might have to see it another time to satisfy my wants, but I don't think it deserved to win Best Picture at the Oscars over 'Saving Private Ryan'. A great and enchanting movie with a brilliant way of going about it. I must look more at the positives, though, and not worry so much about the negatives, but I definitely need to see this another time or maybe two, just so I can truly get the feel of it in me."
"critic-22","7","1","2","12 May 1999"," Shakespeare's demise only matches our own!
","Mmmm........ this movie has an exceptional but short and dramatic performance from Judi Dench. Certainly the script was more worked out than Saving Private Ryan. However this movie falls way short of the inventiveness of La vita E Bella (Life is Beautiful) in every department apart from best female actress which should have gone to Cate in Elizabeth. Though the script of this movie was witty in parts, they are not in the same league of humour that is provided by Roberto in Life is Beautiful. The little boy should have won best supporting actor! Imagine trying to do a plot out of the holocaust which is also a comedy,  far more complex that dry humour. In fact, Shakespeare in Love will probably give the wrong view of the great writer to a much younger generation (as there is no one view of Shakespeare). In addition, this movie shows that propaganda through marketing can win a film company an oscar. The company should have advertised La Vita E Bella, instead of this almost average movie. Name any other movie that can make you laugh and cry at the same time, this movie can't do either - Roberto can do it with ease. The romance (it should be called LUST) elements in Shakespeare in Love were rubbish and modernised to 1990's ideologies with sodomistic sex scenes without purpose, drama and lacking romance (something that Titanic suffered from as well). If you want to know about romance and the human spirit watch Life is Beautiful and understand that romance is about giving it in the good times and the bad and the willingness to stick with one partner. Rating 6/10"
"Tom-262","8","1","2","23 April 1999"," Amusing but nothing more
","I gave this film an eight as I enjoyed the movie and I liked the way the life in those days was portrayed in detail (eg even good looking guys as Shakespeare have mechanics hands). Otherwise the film did not get me really crazy. I was not fully drawn into it and it did not really touch me. I am not quite sure what's the reason for this. Perhaps it's those little things like where is all that hair under the wig, that made the film just too unrealistic.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing, but don't expect to wake up the next morning with your mind still fixed to the movie."
"Jeff G","6","1","2","19 April 1999"," Not bad, but woefully overrated.
","This is ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" for people who don't know Shakespeare.  This is not Stoppard in peak form, but rather Stoppard needing to make a quick buck.  It's clever, true, and fun to watch, but ultimately predictable and ponderous, and nowhere near as good as ""A Simple Plan"" or ""Life is Beautiful"", two films that *definitely* deserved the Best Picture more than this film.<br/><br/>Paltrow's a talented actress, but her Academy Award for this particular film is a joke.  Sheeze, show a little skin and look constipated (apparently, this is what passes for a look of emotional anguish in this film), and your career is guaranteed.  Her performance in Seven was a thousand times better, and as was as underrated as her performance in ""Shakespeare in Love"" was OVERrated.<br/><br/>Still, worth a watching.  It's not bad -- quite witty in places -- and Dench absolutely steals the show.<br/><br/>But still, do yourself a favor.  See ""A Simple Plan"" or ""Life is Beautiful"" first.  Heck, for that matter, see ""The Matrix"" before you see this."
"Rene-6","6","1","2","18 April 1999"," Sorry, this film was not too good
","Possibly I am the only one who gives a bad mark (5) but I was very disappointed by this film. It is all too nervous at the beginning, scenes are cut too fast, the atmosphere is washed away by video-clip styled filming. The actors are not too bad, but the story is very dumb. Even a 3 year old kid recognizes after ten seconds that it is a woman in disguise, but all the dumb people around have no clue until the wig falls down, and are damn surprised. Anyway, I ask myself how she is able to hide so much hair in this wig. A bad film for dumb people, go rather see ""Festen"" or ""Happiness"" is you want to use more brain."
"Dutchey","7","1","2","18 April 1999"," Shakespeare in Love is nice for insiders
","Shakespeare in Love didn't appeal one bit to me, but especially after it won 7 Oscars I started getting curious about it. For me it was the kind of movie where you find yourself just looking at the screen instead of watching the movie. I never really got into it. The music was great, and so were the set decoration and costume design. It won the Oscars for those categories well deserved. I thought SIL was filmed beautifully. Some scenes just had an amazing scenery. What I liked best about SIL was Gwyneth Paltrow. She did a great job and deserves her Oscar I think. I didn't like the parts of her dressed up as a man much though and didn't think they were that convincing (that is, couldn't people tell she was a woman?).<br/><br/>Since this movie's not even close my cup of tea, I as a result didn't get any of the inside Shakespeare and Romeo & Juliet related jokes, so that's part of why I didn't like it much, but if you're into all that, I can imagine you'd love it."
"poppy-13","Null","1","2","14 April 1999"," missing credit to Caryl Brahms and SJ Simon
","This film is very substantially based on the book No Bed for Bacon by Caryl Brahms and SJ Simon - from the opening sequence of Shakespeare respelling his name, through most of the jokes and a substantial amount of the plot ( the love story between Will and a disguised Viola is just one among many labyrinthine subplots in the book), through to the light, witty but erudite feel of the writing, giving Elizabethen England a contemporary feel without losing the period detail (out of which comes much of the humour). It's one of my favourite books, and I missed a credit to it. It's a great read if you can find it. Why is it not there in the spinoff publications? Why has nobody mentioned it? Read it if you can, and see if I'm not right!"
"G8RMAN","5","1","2","11 April 1999"," What's the fuss?
","Ok, this movie is cute. Very clever, even. But Oscar material? Come on. There's some amusing stuff in the vein of Shakey himself, and some funny implications of Bill's relationship with Christopher ""Kit"" Marlowe. But I can't see why Gwynneth was nominated - I'd say her acting in ""Sliding Doors"" was far better than this. To imply that ANYONE could actually be fooled into thinking she is a man, even with a bad goatee, is ludicrous.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because this was the second half of a double-feature with Elizabeth, but Shakespeare in Love paled next to that gem of a period piece. The acting was broad and unbelievable, the plot stilted, the characters more caricatures than anything. Just like Bill would have wanted it."
"Adriane","6","1","2","5 April 1999"," Good, but not worthy of Best Picture
","This movie was good, but it was not wonderful. I personally loved Life is Beautiful, and felt that that was more deserving of more awards than this one. Cate Blanchett was more deserving of the Oscar too, her role was a harder one to pull off. Paltrow did not do or say anything spectacular in this one, not anything Oscar-worthy mind you. All she did was have sex with Shakespeare. But the costumes are incredible and Judi Dench is wonderful in her 8 minutes on-screen. Geoffrey Rush is also funny as well. Sorry, guys the Oscars were too abundant for this film, and some should have gone to others."
"Gregg-24","7","1","2","6 April 1999"," Syrupy Sweet
","To be 1998's Film of the Year as judged by the Academy, the movie had to have been good?  Yes, this was an above average film.  The costumery was magnificent.  Gwyneth Paltrow gave a convincing performance as Viola. Judi Dench also put on an excellent performance as the Queen.  The Queen was cruel, perceptive, but highly likeable in the end.<br/><br/>My first criticism of the movie was the idea of weaving Viola and Shakespeare's star-crossed romance with the well-known tragedy of Romeo & Juliet.  Perhaps it could have worked with a better script, but in the end the concept did not come off well because there was a clear distinction between the play and their real-life situation.  The storyline felt forced-- and false.  The plot would have been more interesting as simply a romance between Shakespeare, an aspiring playwright, and Viola, an aristocrat.<br/><br/>My second criticism of the movie was Ben Affleck's appearance.  Whereas Gywneth and Fiennes became immersed in their characters, Ben Affleck was not able to cross the line.  This was Ben Affleck as Ben Affleck.  His character also had no noteworthy actions in the play that I could discern.  In summary, his appearance was an irritant.<br/><br/>An interesting film.  I rank it a 7 out of 10."
"Mmm-6","6","1","2","5 April 1999"," what do people see in this movie?
","Why people like this movie so much, I have no idea. Granted, there was good acting and a few likable characters. However, to me, the story lacked depth. I didn't see much passion or energy between the two lovers.  Yes, I could tell that they were in love, but it didn't say anything more than that.  I wasn't nearly as affected by the fate of their relationship as I was in, for instance, Life is Beautiful.  I understand that Shakespeare in Love isn't supposed to be a deep movie, but if it really is a comedy, how come I didn't laugh? The Shakespeare references in the dialogue were too gimiky and way over-used.  Other attempts at humor were equally ineffective, predictable, and dry.  What else is there to this movie?"
"Lechuck-5","Null","1","2","5 April 1999"," I liked it. One HUGE quibble, tho...
","Biased or not, I came out of the theatre feeling satisfied, but only such that can come from a calamari appetizer.<br/><br/>The movie did not come from the greatest script. In fact, most if it was either derived from Shakespeare's own noggin, or taken directly out of his tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. It's an irony to find the peak moment of the movie to be the presentation of the play itself; the most unoriginal portion of the movie. Shakespeare's mellifluous words poured from the actors' lips with such craft that I dared wonder why they did not just do a better remake of Romeo and Juliet instead. In all fairness, the script had its clever moments, even with the borrowed creativity. Will's impersonation of Banquo's ghost was brilliance unexpected.<br/><br/>(I do wonder, tho, whether the back story of the writer and actor's plight promoted some bias to the academy's judges. Not a bad point, mind you, just a theory =))<br/><br/>My biggest rant, and it is quite big, aims at the way love was told in this story. It seems to me that the producers wanted to give the audience what they wanted, not what they needed. Love is good, and the fruits of such love should be just as wonderful. Hurrah for Will that his muse could inspire such beautiful words from him. Right?<br/><br/>Has anyone forgotten about Mrs. Shakespeare? It disgusted me to see her portrayed as a hindrance! It doesn't surprise me anymore why people nowadays are so divorce-happy. And can one really attest that it was true love that brought Will and Viola together? I don't know, but the incessant sex with accompanied verse gave me an impression that these are just two souls who get a libido when reciting poetry.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie. But let's not cater to the masses' cravings for a few more pennies in the piggy bank next time. Please?"

This was just a bit of lighthearted fun, nothing more. This was telling a story for the sake of telling one. Saving Private Ryan had a reason.<br/><br/>One argument last year as to why Titanic won best picture over the critic's choice of L.A Confidential, was that Titanic told a human story.

"Don-102","Null","1","2","1 April 1999"," A Better Love Story Than Romeo and Juliet Itself...
","England, 1589. A young playwright named Will Shakespeare is trying to start a new play. He is up on a ""deadline"" and rival playhouses are all over him to produce the work. It seems Will can only write about something personal to him, for instance, his latest muse. Romeo and Rosalind, he'll call it. No, Romeo and the Pirate's Daughter? Not a good title. Will doesn't know it, but an unknown, upper-class wannabe actor/actress up for a part in his unwritten play will be his Juliet. Shakespeare IN LOVE, John Madden's winner for best picture of 1998, presents this speculative story of a struggling literary giant with such originality and sensibility, it may surpass Mr. Shakespeare's own fable of forbidden love.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes IS Willie Shakespeare in a performance so strong and passionate, it is simply amazing how overlooked it was. The film is written so well, the words erupt from the actor's mouths much like Shakespeare's own plays do. Screenwriters Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard even address the long-time myth that Shakespeare was not the sole creator of the most famous literature ever written. Collaboration comes from suggestions in a pub, speakers in the street, and real-life experiences. Could it be that the Bard himself also took his own life experiences and filtered them into his own work? Maybe. It is certainly a practice universally performed by modern writers, authors, and poets. This is Shakespeare IN LOVE's premise and the love story portrayed is both eloquent and sensual.<br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow is the object of Will's affection and superb at recreating Elizabethan charm. You find yourself falling in love with her. ""Romeo and Juliet"" comes about through their experiences together. Fiennes even climbs a tree up to Paltrow's balcony, a great moment from the play. This is all juxtaposed with the play's rehearsal. These scenes are tender, but they also inspire laughter because of what we already know about the story of Romeo and Juliet. Geoffrey Rush provides some more comic relief in a screenplay with so much depth, it is a unique work of art. Each character is given enough screen time to make an impression on us. Even Dame Judi Dench's 8 minutes of Oscar-winning acting is a treat.<br/><br/>I've never seen Shakespeare himself portrayed. This is pure fiction, but Fiennes breathes life into the mysterious figure behind so many colossal texts. For Shakespeare illiterates, you can still enjoy the picture. Everyone speaks in prose, not poetry. A general knowledge of Romeo and Juliet would be helpful, however. The film looks and feels of the time, but a great love story of the 16th century is brought to life in 20th century cinematic fashion. Did it deserve the Best Picture award? No. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did. No matter. It is a true wonder to watch.<br/><br/>RATING: 10 of 10"
"oja","7","1","2","30 March 1999"," Average
","I liked the in-jokes, Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench. But I wonder how Joseph Fiennes got near there. He's good at posing, but I don't call it acting. He masters two face expressions and the same number of gestures (one for love scenes and another for 'get-off-my-way' elbowing through the crowd in 'dramatic' moments). I agree with all who say the story's superficial, anomalous and mellow - it is. And after Gwyneth Paltrow, who will be the next Oscar winner? Pamela Anderson? All in all, the film's quite funny, yet average."

","This movie being number 20 on the all-time IMDB list (as of March 30) shows you how easily people are influenced by hype. I wouldn't put this movie in the top 200 of all time. The movie was enjoyable to a certain extent. I thought Joseph Fiennes (if anyone) deserved an Oscar nod for his performance as Shakespeare. Geoffrey Rush was good. Judi Dench was good. But  Gwyneth Paltrow gave the most over-acted performance of her career. I actually started to like her after ""Sliding Doors"" but man, she was screaming ""give me the oscar"" throughout this whole film. At the first of the movie she was intriguing and luring, but as the movie unfolded, she really became stale. I think that, other than Paltrow, the acting was great. The cinematography was great. The costumes were great. But really, folks, the story was lame. It was too basic and fundamental to keep my attention. And the sex scenes between Paltrow and Fiennes became excessive and unnecessary after the third one. I think they concentrated too much on ""Star Power"" than on the script, which was mundane and contained many factual errors. It tried to rely on being cute and romantic, which obviously was enough to satisfy most moviegoers, but not me. Don't get me wrong, I love love stories, when they are good. This one was trite and boring. 2 out of 4 stars......"
"AKS-6","6","1","2","24 March 1999"," Good -- but a disappointment
","First of all - the movie is good. It is not so good, however, that it deserved an Oscar. A case of lobbyism, I presume. The plot is quite fascinating and I am impressed by the writer. But it seems like there is still something missing in the movie. It is rather tiresome sometimes, and there are no really hilarious scenes. And why did Will and Viola 'get their kits off' so soon? That was a disappointment.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Ben Affleck was great in his small part which came as a bit of a surprise for me. Joseph Fiennes has charisma, but I believe Affleck would have been better cast as Shakespeare. Judi Dench is of course great, not to mention Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth. The real disappointment was Gwyneth Paltrow. It is a shame that she was in the movie at all, she basically destroyed it for me.<br/><br/>I *did* like it though and give it: 6/10."

A midsummer night's dream, there the mechanical characters were blantly terrible actors, yet they had quite a time stirring up their love for the show.  This movie is a great example of what true Shakespeare was....a common man....a man of struggles...but an artist...and by the way....Tom Stoppard is the new ""god of the theatre"" in my mind!  And finally, to the people who didn't feel Judi Dench deserved the oscar...ha! I have been doing Shakespere for a large part of my life...and let me tell you...Queen Elizabeth is one of the hardest characters to play...even if it was for only ten minutes...her presense was known...not just with her costume, but her poise as the bitch queen...and she did capture the look and actions well."

The main reason for this was Miss Paltrow's performance - never before have I seen such a display of over-acting! I really got the impression that she thought - ""Oooh! Shakespeare - now I can be a real *actor* and get some credibility!"". Everytime she was on the screen I just wanted to vomit!

","I've grown up watching many older movies and I am always struck by one thing:  these movies that have stood the test of time have endured because they have SCREENPLAYS.  All About Eve, Adam's Rib, It Happened One Night--great films don't just have a hacked story augmented by many flashy effects or an explosion at the end.  They have something to say, a reason for us to listen.  This reason is for us to renew our love of words, our love of other human beings, what makes life beautiful. Fifty years from now, Titanic and Armageddon will be the three o'clock movie if they're lucky. Shakespeare in Love will have joined the ranks of the classics, and I will watch it and remember the first time I saw it with my friends.

","Shakespeare in Love was a good movie, and I enjoyed it, but I walked away wondering what all the fuss was about.

It's clever and fun and I think Shakespeare himself would have approved.<br/><br/>Best picture?  Best director? I reckon Private Ryan was harder to produce, and so was Elizabeth, and both of those films would get my vote in these categories before this one.<br/><br/>Best actress? Paltrow was good, yes, but her role wasn't that challenging, and her performance can't equal the complexity of Cate Blanchett's in Elizabeth.  In fact, I found her rather unattractive as a ""lad"" and wondered what Will could possibly see in him/her.  (I reckon this was a bit of a sop to that handful of Shakespearean scholars who maintain that Will was probably gay...)  Judi Dench was only on for a few minutes and didn't do anything other than handle her role and the fine script well...what any quality actor would do.<br/><br/>This film was ""low-brow"" Shakespearean theatre at its best, and like the original Shakespeare comedies, it seems to be drawing all sorts of people into theatres for a taste of the Bard--and that's great.  The whole film--indeed the script--relies heavily on theatrical convention (Stoppard is, after all, best known for his stage plays) and it screens like a lively stage performance.  It's fun entertainment with some delightful performances, clever comic touches, and a fine script...but it surely isn't the best the year has to offer."

(And if she and Dame Judi can get Oscar nominations, then why not one for Joseph Fiennes?)<br/><br/>With, at points, every other line being a quote from one Shakespeare play or another, why couldn't the material have been better?<br/><br/>Overall, the hype made this a very disappointing film, which is a shame as it wasn't all that bad."
"Philby-3","Null","1","2","27 February 1999"," Elizabethan entertainment
","Shakespeare being part of Anglo-America's literary heritage, filmmakers still think it worthwhile artistically and financially to seek a new angle on Will's oeuvre despite the plethora of previous productions and relentless dissection of the plays in Eng Lit courses. This clever, colourful and well-paced film asks: who was Will the man, and what drove him to write such enduring plays for the theatre, that most ephemeral of the arts?<br/><br/>Well. fear, lust and survival loom large. But this Shakespeare also has a need to be heard and a need to be loved. It is London, 1593, and 29 year old Will (Joseph Fiennes), married to an older woman back in Stratford he hasn't seen for years, is desperately trying to write something to keep the doors of  the South Bank theatre of his hard-pressed not to say singed friend Henslowe (Geoffery Rush) open. There's fierce competition from Burbage's Curtain Theatre across the river. Will has had some earlier success with plays about Kings with Roman numerals after their names, but Henslowe is demanding a comedy to get bums on seats. Will, however, has a severe case of writer's block and even consults a magician/apothecary, the Elizabethan equivalent of a psychoanalyst. ""Fall in love,"" says Dr Moth (Antony Sher), giving him a magic amulet. So Will does, with the utterly unsuitable Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), daughter of a self-made rich merchant.<br/><br/>Viola loves the theatre and wants to act, which is a problem, since women are forbidden the stage (boys play the younger female parts). So she dresses as a boy and auditions for a part in the still unwritten new comedy with the working title ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter."" As the relationship develops, Will's writer's block evaporates and a more familiar play emerges. History of course records that the play was a hit, but Will and Viola's fictional relationship hits heavy weather. Viola's father, anxious to improve his family's social standing, agrees to marry her off to the arrogant Earl of Wessex (Colin Firth), who needs the family money for a colonisation plan in Virginia. The final scene (Chesapeake Bay, it seems) connects England with America, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" with Shakespeare's next play, ""Twelfth Night.""<br/><br/>We see plenty of street life and squalor, meanness and mendacity, but also we get what can only be described as the healing power of art. Moneylenders and standover men are charmed by the power of theatre in at least temporarily suspending their business activities. The competition, in the form of Burbage (Martin Clunes, not behaving quite so badly here) comes to the rescue at a crucial point. Even Gloriana herself, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench), is moved by Will's story of true love.<br/><br/>It's not too likely that Shakespeare scholars will consider this account of the origins of ""Romeo and Juliet"" as plausible, but the writers, Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, have produced something fresh out of the bones of history and their version is a lot of fun. At one point, QE 1 is faced with a large puddle between her and the coach she is boarding. She looks meaningfully at the assembled nobles who, no doubt mindful of Sir Walter Raleigh's previous gallantry and subsequent preferment, start fiddling with their cloaks. But they are too slow for Gloriana, who, losing patience, strides through the puddle, muttering ""too slow, too slow.""<br/><br/>It's all pretty well done and the performances range from more than adequate to very good. Gwyneth Paltrow is not really a natural beauty (nor English) but she is both elegant and spirited as Viola (and very well dressed). When disguised (badly -only Will does not notice) as the boy actor she looks oddly like k. d. Lang and a great deal sexier. It is in this guise that Will first kisses her - a nice reference to the continuing pointless controversy over Shakespeare's sexuality. As Will, Joseph Fiennes and his big limpid eyes carry off the part of moonstruck lover well, though he is a bit young looking for 29. He is not so convincing in the ""genius at work"" part of the role. Colin Firth is great as the nasty Wessex (Darcy without the redeeming qualities). Judi Dench does an effective Gloriana, even though some of her lines as written lacked punch (where's the famous charm?). There are a host of other good minor players, testament to the depth of talent in English Theatre despite the lousy conditions and poor pay for most of them.<br/><br/>This isn't Shakespeare, and Norman and Stoppard didn't set out to emulate him, but they have produced, with John Madden's seamless directing, a fine entertainment which the Bard himself would have chuckled over. Stoppard, originally Czech and brought up largely outside Britain, has an outsider's perspective on the English language combined with a mastery of it, and this can produce a surreal effect - at times the dialogue is too self-consciously witty to be emotionally true. The whole thing may be a bit of a pastiche, but you won't notice the joins and it won't put you off Shakespeare, which is more than can be said for a lot of Eng Lit courses."

"Rerun-2","Null","1","2","14 February 1999"," Fine job of depicting Shakespeare
","Shakespeare in Love is a kind of flight of fancy about the source of Shakespeare's inspiration being a woman he fell in love with but could not have.  It should hardly come as a surprise to think that Shakespeare should have been inspired by being smitten, since so much of his best poetry emanates from characters who are in love, but the film portrays him as a struggling playwright who has recently been painstakingly penning a play called ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" and finding it unbearable.<br/><br/>This is clearly before he had found his way as one of England's most prominent playwrights.  He is under pressure from the owner of The Rose, a theatre in fierce competition with The Curtain, across the river, where Richard Burbage has just stolen Will's latest play and presented it before the Queen.  The Rose itself is threatened by its moneylender, who wants to see a play on stage in two weeks that will fill the house and make him a fortune.  Meanwhile, all of the thespians auditioning have chosen to quote Marlowe as their demonstration.<br/><br/>Obviously, history dictates that ""Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter"" will undergo signifigant changes before it hits the stage.  Shakespeare finds his will and pen being moved by his love for Lady Viola, a minor noblewoman who is due to be married to the arrogant Lord Wessex.  Wessex is suspicious of Will from their first meeting, and his worst fears are confirmed by the Queen, who interrogates Viola according to custom, to approve her for marriage, and then tells him, ""Have her then, but you'd be a lordly fool.  She's been plucked, and not by you.""  However, he thinks she is in love with Marlowe, since Shakespeare identifies himself as him.<br/><br/>Soon, as the play gradually is shaped into what would become ""Romeo and Juliet"", Viola secretly auditions for the role of Romeo under the guise of a non-existent actor named Thomas Kent.  She is perfect for the role, except for the fact that she is a woman, and therefore barred from the stage. Paltrow gives a winning performance in a character that has to do a sort of Victor/Victoria switch, by playing a woman playing a male actor who plays a female part in a play.<br/><br/>Judi Dench is one of the best things about the film, bringing her characteristic wit with her into her role of Queen Elizabeth.  She is sharp-tongued and unrelenting, but demonstrates subtle sympathy at a crucial moment.  I also enjoyed Joseph Fiennes as Will Shakespeare, who finds the right tone of the tormented artist without creeping into melodrama.  Tom Stoppard does a good job of bringing the language and readings to life.  See it even if you never read a word of Shakespeare."

He showed the passion of a writer, and the frustration of many writers. Geoffrey Rush stole away every scene he was in, and is must for the best supporting actor award for the Oscars. This was one of those rare films when the supporting roles exhibited the strength and contributed to the overall movie on the same level as the major roles.<br/><br/>The rendition of Romeo and Juliet was in my opinion the best I have ever seen..this was how Shakespeare was supposed to be performed!

There are very smart, funny lines and cute little inside jokes for those of us that know the story of ""Romeo and Juliet"" well.  Ben Affleck has a small but hilarious role as a very theatrical hero, a leading man on all stages.  Gwyneth does a fabulous job with her role as an aspiring actress in a time when that is not allowed, forcing her to dress as a male to get on stage.  This leads to a few very funny scenes in the film.  And Joseph Fiennes gives the darkest, most powerful portrayal of the bard.  The two leads look good together and act well together.

","This film, Shakespeare in Love, is a very well crafted comedy. The art direction is absolutely exquisite. It makes you feel like you are actually in London at 1527. I salute John Madden's excellent art direction. The writing is absolutely brilliant. Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman wrote probably the most imaginative and best screenplay of this year. This screenplay is funny, touching, romantic, erotic, and in some cases, heart-breaking. One of the best acting performances this year came from this film. Joseph Fiennes is absolutely taintless as the troubled playwright. Geoffrey Rush gives a very funny and outstanding supporting performance. Ben Affleck also gives a well thought out performance as the upstart actor. But, this film's spotlight goes to the talented Gwyenth Paltrow. Although she has shown she can do period comedies in Emma, she shows she can be a demanding presence on screen as a lead role,as a love interest, and as a very interesting character actress.

"JamesB-4","10","1","2","25 January 1999"," One of the Best Pictures of 1998
","To be clear about things, this is what Shakespeare in Love is.  Shakespeare in Love is a comedy of mistakes about one gentleman in Verona (or, in this case, Elizabethan England) desperately trying to concoct Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter by the Twenty First Night.<br/><br/>Shakespearean puns aside, Shakespeare in Love actually does center about a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Finnes), writing a play on assignment known as Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter, in a period of no less than three weeks.  However, he is making much bother about something: the fact that William Shakespeare, one of history's most prolific playwrights, has writer's block.<br/><br/>In former times, he was able to enjoy himself in adulterous fashion with everyone from the tired wives of Halifax to Othellina, the Mooress of Venice.  Not one of the eight wives of Henry VII can do a damn thing to complain about this lover.<br/><br/>Now, however, he is Hamlet, serf of Sweden with his beloved Ophellia.  He has no inspiration, only angst.  He does not like it as it is. This is, however, until he finds himself smitten with Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).  This temptress causes an emotional tempest.<br/><br/>But, keeping with the pilgrim's passion, he lusts after a woman engaged (do I hear Prince Paris in the wings?), this time to Lord Wessex (played by Colin Firth, who lost another girlfriend to a Fiennes boy in The English Patient).  Lord Wessex comes across with all of the charm of Yiago, Othellina's trusted friend, but he does it in such a funny way that you have to love him.<br/><br/>In fact, you have to love the entire movie.  The way that you see the evolution of Romeo and Ethel evolve into Romeo and Juliet while a similar play is being shown in their lives is a perfect postmodern device: used before and equally well with Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, the highly satiric and intelligent play that launched Tom Stoppard onto the literary scene by telling the story of Hamlet from the view of the friends sent to spy upon him.<br/><br/>Hey!  I went a paragraph without using a pun!  I'm going to my myself something from the merchant of Paris!<br/><br/>The performances are worth writing sonnets about and put Caesar Augustus to shame, one of them already having earned a Golden Globe for Best Actress (Paltrow) and the movie is magical to watch.<br/><br/>What is most interesting to watch, however, is the shrew taming that Stoppard demonstrates over his script.  Equally included are postmodern devices and plain old storytelling.   Grounding humor mixed in with things King Richard the First and Fourth could have been proud of, not to mention any of the Henrys.   Almost every line is tainted with Shakespearean reference.  So, when you see someone laughing their head off for almost no reason, let them: there probably isn't an un-funny line in the script.<br/><br/>In fact, there are equally many lines there for just anyone.  The way it opens has Geoffrey Rush bartering a deal with a loan shark to save his feet from coals.  It has funny quips like, when Shakespeare begins talking in iambic pentameter, Rush saying ""prose, please"".<br/><br/>The fact is that Shakespeare in love is incredibly funny, incredibly brilliant, incredibly beautiful.  It's exactly as I like it.  Next to Saving Private Ryan I would have to call it the best film of the year, and boy is it a close second.  Shakespeare buffs like myself will get all of the inside jokes, non-Shakespeare fans will be swept off their feet by the love story and by the humor that they'll get.  Everyone will enjoy, from Timon of the New York City Homeless Shelter to the King of Lears, Bill Gates.<br/><br/>It doesn't even have an unhappy ending!  But I can't tell you much more except this: all that ends well is well and that's the last pun you'll hear in this summer's tale of a late winter's daydream."

I was enchanted by this film. It was one of the most cleverly written and unique movies I have seen in a long time. The parallels between what Will writes in his play and the actual plot of the movie were ingenious. Joseph Fiennes has been added to my list of must see actors, and Gwyneth was, once again, elegant and a joy to watch. The supporting cast was nothing short of brilliant, especially Geoffrey Rush, who stole every scene he was in.<br/><br/>This movie is a gem from start to finish;  It's rare that I leave a movie wanting to turn right back around to see it again.

","For awhile now my friends and I have found Romeo and Juliet (the play) to be somewhat lacking. Romeo seemed to be a pretty fickle guy.

""Shakespeare in Love', changed that opinion. It shows you the love and heartache that could have created the scenes.<br/><br/>If you liked `Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead' go see this. If you thought it was lacking, go see this because it succeeds in those places where the other may have failed. I thought both were excellent films, but this movie moved me.

WOW! Girls, if for no other reason go see these two movies to see this guy.

After seeing this movie, I have to say that ""Shakespeare in Love"" not a typical movie in any way.  I thought the casting was as wonderful as the acting. Just when I thought G.Paltrow was just a pretty face to sell to the general public, she proves me otherwise. As someone else has already pointed out, the acting of ""Romeo and Juliet"" within the movie was amazing by itself. I found myself thinking I would like to see that same cast do ""Romeo and Juliet"" as a separate entity (unlike the MTV version introduced not so long ago which I could've done without.) The way in which the writing dreamed up the effects of Shakespeare's world on his works was very original. In my opinion this move is very worth the money. Very rarely do I say, ""I would go see this movie again at the theaters"", but here I am saying it. Go see this movie."

","I never could understand all the fuss and fury over this period comedy of manners that has GWYNETH PALTROW parading herself as a boy because women were not allowed to partake in theater centuries ago when William Shakespeare (Joseph FIENNES) was writing his passionate plays.<br/><br/>First of all, anyone who couldn't tell that Paltrow was--well, Paltrow in boy's clothing--should have had his eyes examined. So much for believability. Then we have the miscast Joseph FIENNES looking like a Gypsy with an earring and a Mafia-like manner who wandered out of a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn to play the famous Bard. He's not a bad actor at all, just dreadfully miscast. To believe him as the writer of these passion plays is hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Then we have BEN AFFLECK who appears and disappears from the plot for long periods of time--so long that we forget he's even in the movie. And COLIN FIRTH, wasted in a colorless role. And for some strange reason, JUDI DENCH appears for eight minutes as Queen Elizabeth I and gets an Oscar for Best Supporting Role.<br/><br/>Not at all helpful for me to review the film is the fact that I put off seeing it shortly after watching GWYNETH PALTROW's tearful, hysterical Oscar acceptance speech. I was so turned off by her out of control moments that I swore not to watch the film. Well, I relented finally, but was severely disappointed by the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Sure, it's an enjoyable costumed romp with lots of period flavor in settings and costumes and some nice color cinematography.

","In London in 1593 the theatre industry is shaky for Will Shakespeare.  He's lost his muse and is struggling to write his new comedy `Romeo and Ethel the pirates daughter'.  Lady Viola Lesseps, frustrated by the theatre's lack of women dresses as a man and lands the part but also Shakespeare's heart. With the production in motion Shakespeare must battle forbidden love, debts and troublesome actors to produce his play.<br/><br/>A far cry from a traditional piece this sees a colourful blend of tradition, comedy, modern wit and a sheer abandonment of history in favour of entertainment.  Even the cast shows the mix of theatre and populist culture, in it's inclusion of stage actors and a range of TV comedians from such as `the fast show'.  The story is absurd, but happily Stoppard and everyone else knows it and lets us know it as well.  For example Viola's poor `man' disguise is revealed by a boatman who says to Shakespeare that it wouldn't have fooled a child.  (Although in fairness Shakespeare himself used this device on many occasions).<br/><br/>The story is full of romance and comedy is equal measures and is really well pulled off by all the cast.  The problems of the laziness in the script are well handled - as Henslowe keeps telling us `it'll work out, it always does'.  For example, Queen Victoria appears in full gear in a theatre - but had gone unnoticed for the whole performance.<br/><br/>The cast are superb and play the whole thing with a huge amount of fun that is befitting the material.  Fiennes manages something that he rarely does - he is good!  Paltrow is OK, but definitely doesn't convince in the scenes where she acts as Juliet in the play.  Affleck is better but you can't help but feel that both American stars are only there to make it sellable in the US.  Judi Dench is only onscreen for about 10 minutes all told and she isn't that good - she is very cold and distant, not really allowed to give her Queen any character.  She won an Oscar but lets be honest - she was given that out of sympathy for her not getting it for her superb Queen Victoria in Mrs Brown.  She didn't deserve it for this, but then I suppose most Americans aren't smart enough to work out that this was a different film! The rest of the cast are really good made up of quality stage names and comedians - Rush, Wilkinson, Callow, Anthony Sher mix effortlessly with Martin Clunes and Simon Day.<br/><br/>It's all a bit daft but it's done with such a sense of fun that it almost carries it off.

The plot is simplistic and over-familiar, the acting merely acceptable, and the constant nods and winks to the budding auteur's work quickly grows excessive and wearying. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are attractive people and make convincing googly eyes at one another, but their relationship is so swift and passion-fueled that it never feels like more than a fiery seasonal fling. Judi Dench took home a best supporting actress statue for her work as Queen Elizabeth I, though she barely makes a cameo appearance and most of her work seems done by the wardrobe department.

Obviously whoever wrote this script knows more about Shakespeare than all my children's children will ever know, as evidenced in the play-within-the-play structure and the combination of Romeo and Juliet themes with other Shakespearean plays. Another one of the reasons why this movie was so successful is the dramatization of character change (also pulled off my the golden cast), not too mention, the frequent plot twists.

But if you just forget this detail the movie is agreeable to watch, being a half-comedy and a half-tragedy. The best moments of the movie are the parts where the real play is performed since ""Romeo and Juliet"" keeps being the best and most beautiful love story ever written not matched at all by the love story narrated in the movie.

In my opinion, ""Shakespeare in Love"" happens to be those unworthy Oscar winning films.<br/><br/>Winner of 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, ""Shakespeare in Love"" is far from perfect in my opinion. While I don't think this film is Oscar worthy, I could see it getting nominated for Golden Globes and nothing more. While the plot might not be the dumbest thing in the world, it is definitely not the greatest. The acting was far from perfect and Joeseph Fiennes is the only person that truly stood out in this film. He deserved the Oscar more than Gweneth Paltrow did. The script was probably the best element of the film, because it really reflects the spoken dialog of this era. The direction could've been better but it is not a total let down.<br/><br/>So what I'm trying to say is, why are these types of films continuing to get Oscar nominations? Why wasn't Primary Colors(another film released in 1998) nominated for more awards? Well I guess Hollywood has a soft spot for gushy romantic comedies.

","This over-rated film owes most of its good ideas to the novel ""No Bed for Bacon"" by Caryl Brahms and S. J. Simon. The politics and economics of running the Globe Theater, the role of Shakespeare as ""the hack"", the young woman who pretends to be a boy so as to play female roles at the theater, the emotional relations between her and Shaikespeare, even the little joke-scene in which he practises different spellings for his surname - all this is a straight lift from Brahms and Simon. With that removed, there remains the running joke about John Fletcher, the soft-porn sex, and the clumsy sub-plot about Marlowe."

","Oddly enough, there seem to be a number of negative comments regarding this movie. Unfortunately, I think many people saw it AFTER it won the awards and got lots of praise and found that it did not quite live up to their high expectations.<br/><br/>In my opinion, however, it is a very good film. It is surprising, actually, that it was not made before - very little is known about Shakespeare's personal life, and much of what we consider ""fact"" is still uncertain. This leaves quite a lot of room for experimentation.<br/><br/>The plot was nice, and it was lots of fun to see common themes from Shakespeare's plays appearing in the film. The only problem I had was the fact that Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) was disguised as a boy. I think it was used because women disguised as men often appear in Shakespeare's plays, but it is an overused concept. Every novel of historical fiction that I have read about Shakespeare uses this, and it gets a bit dull after awhile.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was very well done. Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow were good in the leads, and I particularly enjoyed Ben Affleck's performance as Ned Alleyn. In an uncredited performance as Kit Marlowe (he only appeared for a few minutes), Rupert Everett was as good as ever, and I wish that we'd seen more of him. His character is discussed throughout the film and has even convinced me to read some Marlowe which I have never done.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it very much, and I think it deserved the awards it won."

","Technically, I suppose this movie deserves some credit.  The stage and costumes were exquisite, and, for the most part, the actors seemed to have given their all.  It wasn't their fault the flawed screenplay was a dull as a door.  I'm sure Shakespeare would be rolling in his grave were he to see some of the historical inaccuracies portrayed here.  The use of music was inappropriately excessive.  Just about every scene was filled with notes and notes and notes, as if to cue the audience with what emotion they should have at that point.  Although I feel Paltrow is a fine actress with a stable career ahead of her, her character in 'Sliding Doors' had much more depth. Also, I would have rather seen Colin Firth in the role of Shakespeare."

It's dressed perfectly and has tomato and cheese and lettuce hanging over the side. But then when you bite into it, it tastes like cardboard.  That is what this film was like to me.

The movie was dull. Actors were ok, but still somethings missing from this movie, maybe something that makes movie interesting and entertaining, but this film hasn't none of it. Judi Dench is a good actor, but in this film she just appears too little time and after the film I heard that she is nominated for oscar of her role. Dench was really good, but the screen time is too short to get a oscar. I think Truman Show should got more oscar nominations than only three, especially Carrey should been nominated for oscar for that role, but back to Shakespeare in Love. The film looks good, especially costumes look very nice. Well photographed in aspect ratio 2:35:5. Well, unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment."
"bnorris","5","1","3","26 December 1998"," disappointment.
","I had high hopes for this film, and overall I was let down. Although all the actors performed admirably, and the writing was jaunty, the overall fabric of the film was gauzy and torn with cliches. I would expect more from Stoppard after Rozencrantz and Guildernstern. If you've seen Romeo and Juliet, you've basically seen this movie. Considering R&J is my least favorite Shakespearean play, I'm not surprised that I didn't like it. Much of the plot centers around the juxtaposition of Shakespeare's ""real life"" as it influenced the writing of R&J.<br/><br/>The bright side of this film was the comedic element, which was refreshing and witty. However, it hardly could compensate for the triteness of the love story, in my opinion. Actually, Branaugh's A Midwinter's Tale was a much better film about the production of a Shakespearean piece (Hamlet), although it didn't star the Bard himself. Not to be a historical stickler (especially due to the fact that there is little hard biographical evidence about the life of Shakespeare) but the film also lost points with me for venturing so far into the realm of speculation and fiction.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who is fond of Romeo and Juliet, or of ""timeless love stories."" People not familiar with Shakespeare (works or life) will be able to enjoy the witty humor and trotting pace of this film. Yet for the rest of us, it would be best to wait for two for one rental night."

The performances of the lead players was in my mind rather ordinary, (Tom Wilkinson had by far the best lines) and I left fearing critics alike had - rather predictably - gotten caught up with the bardwagon.<br/><br/>Having shared my views with others I'm tired of hearing 'oh but you must have missed the clever references to some of Shakespeare's finest works..'

","Once you are accepting the fact that this is a typical Hollywood blockbuster you can somewhat enjoy the show. If you are slightly educated and acquainted with Shakespeare on a certain level there won't be any surprises about the unfolding of this plot. That is except for it's competition for the most ridiculous and most daring allusions to the historical facts in an attempt to squeeze ""Romeo and Juliet"" into Shakespeare's biography by force. The characters are flat and simple. Gwyneth Paltrow does her job of acting being passionately cute with her gasping duck face looks adoring both poetry and poet. Only the bizarre boy shows through his cruel sense of humor and his sadistic obedience how the general perception of violence in public was in those days. Also the Queen is portrayed in an appealing way demonstrating her absolute power and the stiff and inhuman but yet lively and intelligent moves. The final highlight or climax in unacceptable and most improbable unrealistic reactions is when the husband Lord Wessex sneaks into the theatre just to calm down and watch his wife kissing his rival on stage. To my mind this production is a sugar free and condensed version of Shakespeare that can only survive in entertaining by straining overused strategies of modern American film industry. No match to the original."

","This question is answered with all the clarity and vulgarity we are used to see in contemporary mainstream cinema: The genius is something that comes directly from the intestines, that is to say the stronger this organ the stronger the ""muse"". Translation between both levels is pretty direct: the poet transfers his feelings in verses, without any considerable modification, and the better we know the life the better we understand the work. Too bad that this movie is historically so very unprecise, and that it omits the (if we are talking about Shakespeare's ""love""!) crucial fact of the master's bisexuality. - Other circumstances as Fiennes' completely exaggerated play and the absence of any true humor make this opus one of the poorest we've seen in the last five years."

Anyway, he tries to find his one true love as he writes boring plays and recieves little credit for his work.  He then finds someone who auditions to play the part of a male in one of his plays and hard as this lady tries to be a man I cannot see why there was nobody who caught on to the fact that it was a lady but Shakespear writes letters to this lady played by the fake male as she writes letters back to him and during the end of the movie they both recognize eachother and fall in love.  She then is to be married by the Duke of Earl in whom she hates and tries to marry Shakespear instead but after all of the lovemaking and promises she finds that Shakespear is married and is doing nothing but cheating on his wife.  He then convinces her that he's really in love with her and the rest but most of the movie is about this little love triangle between the two.  It gets very boring seeing this goof acting as if he is a ladies man and she falls in love with him but deserves much better than him.

","It is extremely seldom that I feel like I've wasted my time after watching a movie, yet this movie left me feeling that way. The movie is not only slow and boring, but predictable throughout. The characters all lack character, they are one-dimensional and stereotyped, and as such I found them (and the acting) quite unconvincing. When Wessex refers to Viola as ""property"" (and makes various similar derogatory comments during the movie) this comes off as merely a cheap attempt to evoke a particular reaction and feeling from the audience - we are ""supposed"" to dislike this character. The same applies to all the major characters in the movie - we are told exactly how we are supposed to feel about them throughout the movie. These techniques are Hollywood textbook, and I guess I expected a little more from a movie that managed the number of awards it did (which I found out only after having watched the movie). The storyline is fairly predictable; we are often told in advance exactly what to expect will happen later in the movie (e.g. when the Queen makes the wager, we know already how this will pan out).<br/><br/>The romantic parts are excessive and trite, but may appeal to Mills & Boons fans and thirteen year old girls. The comedy was lacking - there were maybe six or seven funny parts throughout the movie, and most of these were either already shown in the preview, or were predictable and hackneyed. I found the recreation of the setting of Shakespearean London unconvincing - although a lot of effort and research were obviously put into this (costumes, props, extras), the implementation came off to me as being overdone.<br/><br/>The movie is obviously well researched and well produced, but lacks character and substance.

"basilisksamuk","6","0","2","23 February 2013"," A good film spoiled by anachronistic jokes
","William Shakespeare falls in love with a noblewoman, cures his writers block, hob-nobs with various Elizabethan characters like Queen Elizabeth 1 and Christopher Marlowe, introduces the first woman onto the British stage and writes one of the finest plays in the English language. All this is very enjoyable and as a love story I really enjoyed the film. I was also very impressed by the quality of most of the script. In particular there are some quite wonderful sequences which intercut scenes from Romeo and Juliet as it is performed and the interactions between the characters in the film. Many of these scenes were masterfully handled (or should that be personfully these days?). It reminded me very much of scenes from ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" so I wasn't surprised at all to see that Tom Stoppard was one of the scriptwriters. In fact I assume Stoppard was responsible for the best parts of the script though I may be wrong about that.<br/><br/>It was odd to see both Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes playing in virtually the same costumes that they had worn in Elizabeth. Both play excellently as does Ben Affleck (making some amends for that truly dreadful Will Hunting abomination) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the object of Shakespeare's affection. Personally I found it hard to see Paltrow as Juliet but she is an excellent actress. In fact everyone in the film acts their socks off and it would be difficult to find fault with them.<br/><br/>An excellent film based on what I've said so far then. But there are unfortunately quite significant problems with it and they reside almost entirely with the comedic aspects of the script. Throughout the film, but especially in the first third of it, there are a series of jokes that would be rejected for a Carry On film. If I tell you that one of the better comic lines is ""Follow that boat"" then you will get the idea. The jokes are also anachronistic in the way that the language used in Xena, Warrior Princess is California-speak transplanted to ancient Greece. But it works in Xena because it is done to the Max. In this film it hardly ever works because the jokes are in modern parlance whilst the rest of the script is written with proper regard to the nuances of the language of the time. The fact that there are so many actors from British TV comedies is also very distracting for a British audience because you are never sure when they are supposed to be taken seriously or when they are working up to another weak joke.<br/><br/>I have no doubt whatsoever that this film would have been improved by playing it as a straightforward historical romance and dropping the anachronistic jokes. This does not mean that funny scenes are not allowed but simply that it IS difficult to have your cake and eat it. I really enjoyed the film but the jarring switches between ancient and modern spoiled it for me and are wholly responsible for me knocking at least one star off of my rating.<br/><br/>A nearly brilliant film spoiled by alleged comic interludes."

","I want to say right off the top that there's is a lot to really like about this movie. First, the performances of the two leads (Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow as Lady Viola) were excellent, and the supporting performances from folks such as Colin Firth, Judi Dench, Ben Affleck and Simon Callow were equally good. The sets offered a wonderful feel of Elizabethan England and the costumes were magnificent. It was the overall story that just didn't capture me, and even there I'm not sure why. It had a lot of comedic potential. Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block as he struggles with a deadline to write a play called ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter."" (!) That alone has to be good for a few laughs. His writer's block seems to be directly related to his lack of a female muse, whose love would inspire him. Into that void steps Lady Viola, who not only falls in love with Shakespeare, in spite of the fact that she's to be married, but ends up starring as Romeo, once she disguises herself as a man (because women weren't allowed on the stage in Elizabethan England.) Shakespeare discovers the truth and the two begin a passionate love affair that overcomes Shakespeare's difficulty and he produces not ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"" but instead ""Romeo and Juliet.""<br/><br/>I don't really know what the problem was. I can't pinpoint anything in particular except to say that the story (as promising and well portrayed as it was) just didn't draw me in. By all means, watch it. Obviously, a lot of people like it, and I can't really find fault with it. It just didn't grab me. (5/10)"

","William Shakespeare is struggling with the writing of his new play, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. Look at the title of that play and it doesn't take a Shakespearean scholar to see where this is headed. Yes, this will be the story of the making of Romeo and Juliet. Not the true story but a fanciful notion of what might have been. And after watching this film you can't help but wish that this had actually been the way it played out. Because it's a great story. A smart one too, with a script so chock-full of brilliant little nuggets that Shakespeare himself would be proud. It's a story of forbidden love, Shakespeare weaving the events of his own life into the famous play we know so well. But along with the love there are laughs as we watch Shakespeare and his players struggle to bring Romeo and Juliet to life. And there are so many sly, witty references to other famous works of Shakespeare that it is probably impossible to catch them all. Like any great story this one requires great performers to give it life. Happily this film has great performers in abundance.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare and captures wonderfully all the frustrations of a struggling playwright. He also makes for part of a great pair as Shakespeare struggles with his love which cannot be. The woman he falls for is Viola De Lesseps, a woman of privilege and, not incidentally, a huge fan of theater. She falls for Shakespeare just as hard and just as quickly as he falls for her. But unfortunately their love is doomed as she is promised in marriage to the rather odious Lord Wessex. Meanwhile Viola, huge theater fan that she is, is determined to play a role in Shakespeare's newest play despite the prohibition on women performers in this era. Disguised as a man she wins the part of Romeo. Shakespeare uncovers her true identity and their love continues to bloom even as she keeps up her charade. She is his inspiration, his lover and his lead performer. But her charade cannot last and neither can their love. Eventually, and inevitably, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>The part of Viola, a dual role really, is a very challenging one to play and Gwyneth Paltrow does a magnificent job with it. She's a beautiful, radiant, charming woman who can slap on a fake mustache and a wig and fool everyone into thinking she's a man. A life with two sides and Paltrow is letter-perfect throughout. As a woman she's a wonderful lover. As a man she's a heck of a performer. Of course her dual life causes complications. It also causes laughs. This is not a film to leave you rolling in the aisles but there is a lot of good comedy here, and smart comedy at that. And while it is Fiennes and Paltrow at the heart of the story who are most responsible for carrying the film there are so many other fine performances here. As Queen Elizabeth Judi Dench isn't on the screen much but she makes the most of every moment she has. Such a great presence and she manages to provide some humor as well. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson and Colin Firth all get their moments to shine. And playing a cocky, egotistical actor there's Ben Affleck, who plays the part with a knowing wink and plays it wonderfully. This is a film with a lot of charm and plenty of wit. Maybe it never hits the highest comedic heights but it will probably have you smiling throughout. Yes, as so many have stated, the fact that it beat out Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture is rather baffling. Doesn't mean it's not a good film in its own right though. The screenplay is brilliant, the performances are terrific. It makes for, if not Best Picture material, a thoroughly enjoyable diversion."

","In this romantic comedy-drama, Shakespeare falls in love with a young woman and is inspired to write ""Romeo and Juliet."" The period is nicely evoked and it is a pleasant enough film, although hardly worthy of the Best Picture Oscar. The weighty subject matter makes it appear to be more than the fluff that it is. Paltrow radiates charm and does a decent British accent. In the silly tradition of Clark Kent and his glasses, she puts on a mustache and nobody recognizes her, including her lover. Fiennes is OK if a bit too brooding as the bard. It's strange seeing Affleck among the fine cast of British actors, but he does not embarrass himself. Dench hams it up as Queen Elizabeth."

","I didn't this movie was all that great! I still can't believe this movie won Best Picture even over a movie like Saving Private Ryan! I thought the movie was boring and cheesy! The love story between Will and Viola was just as cheesy as a little girl's movie! Another thing I didn't like about it was that they barely showed the true love between Will and Viola The only thing they really did was have sex a million times! There's no true love in sex! There really were only a few scenes that truly showed the love between them! Other than that, the acting was really good! Gwyneth Paltrow deserved her Academy Award and so did Judi Dench. I thought Geoffrey Rush did a pretty good job too. After seeing this movie, I really have lost my respect for William Shakespeare. He was really only a lover who was lead by his emotions to fall in love with Viola. He even had a wife before Viola! Who knows, he could've been just as in love with her. You can't help who you fall in love with. And if the scene with him and that other writer is true, the cornerstone of Romeo and Juliet was hardly his idea! I thought this movie was all acting and nothing great. Just another movie to watch only when you're extremely bored."

","Given the little information available on Shakespeare the Man a movie, either full of gravitas or, as here, a tongue-in-cheek entry, was a brilliant idea waiting to happen and the only mystery is what took so long. The two writers have contrived to cater for just about everyone from the Shakespeare scholar to those with a reasonably nodding acquaintance - i.e. someone who can name say ten of the plays off the top of their head and are aware of Marlowe as the author of The Jew Of Malta, Tamburlaine and Dr. Faustus but wouldn't necessarily associate 'Kit' with CM - to those who wouldn't know Shakespeare from Pete Doherty but have a thing about Gwynneth Paltrow, Joe Fiennes or both and provided humor for all from the 'in' jokes such as the bloodthirsty young boy who identifies himself as John Webster, to the conceit of Shakespeare seeing a shrink to say nothing of the Victor Victoria spin on girls playing boys playing girls and the wry twist on Romeo and Juliet. This movie has just about everything, spectacle, social history, satire, romance, glamor and top quality thesping all round. Definitely one to own on DVD and replay annually."

","Shakespeare in Love is an alright film. I like the casting of Tom Wilkinson, Imelda Staunton, Judi Dench, Anthony Sher, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Affleck, etc. It really is a first cast. The script is better than good, almost great. The directing is also first rate. But this is where I agree that another film by Steven Spielberg should have won the Best Picture for the Oscar. What Shakespeare lacked, Spielberg well provided for in his triumphant film of the Normandy landing. Yes, Tom Stoppard is a wonderful playwright, very cerebral, and it is a good love story. I don't think it was Paltrow's finest performance to date but then I like Shallow Hal better. The film is worthy to watch for historic and educational purposes. It is also a very entertaining film as well. It has a humorous moments. First of all, Judi should have won an Oscar for a role earlier in her performance in ""Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown."" Like another film, she gets honored a year later for an 8 minutes performance (a record). Maybe they forgot Beatrice Straight's performance in Network which won an Oscar as well."

","We were ""forced"" to watch this movie in school for our movie-critiquing-project, and I thought that this film would be boring and senseless like that of ""A Knight's Tale"", yet I was proved wrong. Though it was not really based on the real man's life, ""Shakespeare in Love"" gave its viewers a setting similar to that of Shakespeare's, in a more romantic, lovelier and lighter tone, which people of all generations could appreciate. Who would've thought that Shakespeare has a Viola, besides Anne Hathaway (not to be mistaken with the actress Anne Hathaway) and Rosaline? The actors did a very good job. Gwyneth Paltrow (Lady Viola) was dashing: she played her part very well. She seems to be real Viola whom Shakespeare loved and whom Shakespeare got his inspiration in writing one of the most beautiful love stories made in the face of the earth: Romeo and Juliet. Ralph Fiennes has his own gift of acting, different from his brother's, and that definitely gave him his own sense of identity. The movie itself was tragic, yes, but in a way, comical. John Webster (Joe Roberts) gave light and conflict in the story in a funny and selfish way. The other actors did a very good job. The movie was both entertaining and very educational, which serves as an explanation why our teacher chose this movie for us to critic. No doubt it was blessed with 7 Oscars and plenty of other international awards."

","There's more than one way to look at this film, but when you first watch it, I guess you'd fall in love quickly with Shakespeare, Viola, Henslowe, Ned and the other characters in the tiny village that London seems to be in this setting. The way Shakespeare's original Romeo and Juliet lines are used in the dialogs outside the ""rehearsals"" are inspiring because they make you curious about the original play (I would definitely advise anyone to get to see Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet too, if that didn't happen yet). I didn't always like the way Gwyneth Paltrow played Thomas Kent who played Romeo, I was wondering if that was part of the serious (romantic) side of the film or if it was ironic, showing the amateurism of the rehearsals. I loved the way she played Viola most of the time. The first scene where she appears, silently speaking along with the ""Silvia"" lines, is fantastic. You'd fall in love with her straight away. Joseph Fiennes is the perfect Shakespeare, too. Another good scene is where Ben Affleck first shows up, aggressively, immediately humiliating the guy who brings in the money. ""Then you may remain, if you remain silent."" What in fact happens in the film, everybody's transformed into a better person. It gets the best side out of almost everyone. Why then don't Will and Viola get the chance to unite for good? The queen blames God, but that is nonsense. The end actually breaks your heart. You can't help thinking that Viola really is forced to sleep with Lord Wessex from now on. So you do hope the end is the thing that ""really"" happened: shipwreck, Viola the only survivor, and so on... In spite of the occasional ""stickiness"" that's in this film, it's a ""mood changer"" and I mean it lifts you up in amazement of how painful love can be. But maybe no one would want to miss than kind of pain? Try not to get your eyes humid while smiling!"

","When I first saw Shakespeare in love in 1998, Gwyneth Paltrow had just won her Oscar, and I was mostly curious about that. So what I remember from then is that indeed, she impressed me for being so luminous, giving a passionate, yet fresh performance, something that alas, she hasn't been quite able to reiterate so far... Now watching it again on DVD, I'm only sorry that I don't care much for the Viola/Will relationship. Joseph Fiennes plays well, but he looks dull, and at the same time too modern and not exactly a credible Shakespeare. Otherwise, it's a delightful movie. The basis idea is very interesting, it's cleverly written, perfectly directed, it provides us with some moments of pure comedy, and the costumes are gorgeous. But its best quality lies in that exceptional gallery of supporting characters (with the possible exception of Ben Affleck, mostly being Ben Affleck in breeches). They're all three dimensional, often hilarious, played by the cream of British actors with the likes of Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Rupert Everett, Geoffrey Rush... And the most enjoyable maybe being the always wonderful (and handsome) Colin Firth, as the ""villain"", irritating, laughable Lord Wessex, managing to make touching, lovable and still utterly funny a character who has all the circumstances against him.

Saving Private Ryan on the other hand was film makiing of the highest order, telling a tale that was moving and caused most of the people who watched it to shed a tear at the end. There were numerous firsts for cinemetography, the grainy techniques used in the battle scenes with the herky, jerky movement of the battle scenes, the sound track was tremendous and I am now convinced that Steven Speilberg is the greatest story teller of them all and the fact that he didn't win for best picture in 1999 was because of sheer jealousy on the part of the memebers of the academy.

No problem - lots of fine movies, drama, and fiction take liberties with the facts to good imaginative result (and where would painters of historical subjects from Raphael to David be if they couldn't make up all kinds of preposterous scenes involving their characters?).<br/><br/>But I really must object to the way Tom Stoppard, who's been dramatizing historical subjects for decades, heartlessly marks Gwyneth Paltrow's character, Viola, for death or abduction in Shakespeare in Love. If you've seen the movie and are not sure what I mean, here are the facts:<br/><br/>The movie takes place during Elizabeth I's reign. Viola, at the end of the movie, (SPOILER!) decides to go off to ""Virginia"" with her new husband and have Shakespeare's baby there, rather than stay in England. Supposedly, this tells us something about the independent spirit of the English settlers in America and the source of America's particular ""genius."" But none of this adds up historically. Here's why:<br/><br/>1) No high-born, wealthy English lord like Viola's husband actually moved to America in those days - they often sponsored expeditions and settlements there, but they stayed in England while the impecunious settlers suffered through. 2) No permanent English settlement was established in North America during Elizabeth's reign. The ""Virginia"" colony established by Sir Walter Raleigh and others (which seems to be what the characters are referring to here) is better known today as Roanoke, because it was founded on Roanoke Island on the North Carolina coast. The Roanoke colony disappeared with barely a trace a few years after it was set up. The next ship from England found nothing but ruins of their fort and a puzzling message that said ""Gone to Croatan."" Not a single one of the colonists was ever found (it's one of the great unsolved historical mysteries). Poor Gwynnie!<br/><br/>Did Stoppard not know that the first permanent English colony in North America - today's Virginia - was not established until 1610, seven years after Elizabeth died? If not, didn't someone on this project know enough American history to tell him? With all that attention to ""period detail,"" you'd think they would have got this bit right.<br/><br/>My guess is that Stoppard wanted to write the colorful Elizabeth (and her mouthful of bad teeth) into the story, rather than her successor James I, a much duller historical figure. So he fudged it and guessed the rest of us wouldn't realize. On the other hand, maybe he too found the whole project a bit cloying and cutesy and decided to create a grisly fate for one of his main characters. Anyone have his email address so I can find out?"
"rupcousens","Null","0","1","19 February 2002"," Was Shakespeare really so straight?
","This film annoys me - and not just because it feels like a smug, obvious, feature-length episode of Blackadder. What winds me up is its shallow, lazily populist heterosexism, so out of keeping with the subversive play of gender and sexuality that Shakespeare's comedies celebrate. The subtext of the film, though it's hardly sub, is that the relationships within the theatrical group (where boys play girls) are only pretend, unsatisfactory, incomplete - and that for genuine romantic love, only true heterosexual relationships will do. The film charts Shakespeare's supposed education in this. The irony of the suggestion that Gwyneth Paltrow's character ultimately inspires Shakespeare to create Viola in Twelfth Night, perhaps the most gender-bending of all Shakespeare's plays, seems lost on the movie.<br/><br/>
This crass reduction of Shakespeare's daring, inclusive art, and its translation of of a sexually complex playwright's life into something quite the opposite of what he stood for, is all the more surprising coming from the scriptwriter: Tom Stoppard. Stoppard wrote a fantastic play about A E Housman called 'The Invention of Love' which is as subtle and sympathetic an examination of sexuality as you're likely to find."

","I think 'Shakespeare in Love' is a well-made film with a good story, but not that interesting to look him for a second time. For my opinion the story is a too typical love story, without any surprises, which is okay for one time, but not for a second or even a third time. The film would already loose his few tention, because you would exactly know what will happen. But interesting was, that you got some information about Shakespeares time, for example the influence of the monarch and the importance of the theatre, but I missed some information about Shakespeare himself. Also very well-made were the costumes and the whole scenery like the theatre and the old streets.They let me feel a little bit taken back into Shakespeares time. Summing-up I can say, that it is a good film, which you should have seen."

","I liked the film `Shakespeare in Love', even though there are some points I would criticize.  What I appreciated were the costumes and the whole making of the film - I really enjoyed to get the possibility to see a whole different world and to get an impression about how people lived and thought in this time. Another good thing about this movie were the characters, especially the one of Viola De Lesses. I could identify with this young, intelligent lady, who is not satisfied with the role she is expected to have in the society. She fights for her dream to act in a theatre and she doesn't behave the way she should. In my opinion Gwyneth Paltrow is playing this part very well, she fits perfectly to this role. What I also liked was the comedian site of this film, e.g. the nurse or the scene where a big fight is started in the theatre. Whom I didn't like that much was Joseph Fiennes. I mean, he acted very well but I'd preferred an actor who is more handsome (Ben Affleck for example). I also didn't like the end of the movie, I'd rather seen a happy end even though it might be unrealistic, but it's more romantic. So I think this movie is interesting to be seen once, but I wouldn't watch it one more time."

","We watched ""Shakespeare in Love"" at school, and I think this film is quite good. But it's one of these films, you can only watch once, cause then you'll get bored. The story was quite amusing and sometimes even a bit funny. But it was just a love-story like every other too (Romeo&Juliet,Titanic...they love each other, but they can't get each other...).Even Gweneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes couldn't change that, though they acted very good and authentically. But I think they could have chosen another actor for William Shakespeare, Joseph Fiennes isn't that good-looking :-) What I thought was the best about this film, were the costumes. These artful robes and old dresses are something fascinating I think, and they were very good made and arranged in the film. So, concluding I would say ""Shakespeare in Love is a fairly good film, bit it wasn't that thrilling that I would watch it again."
"Spleen","10","0","1","15 December 2001"," Sigh. About the Oscar...
","Obviously it would have been more just to give the Best Picture award to ""Life is Beautiful"", but I'm in two minds as to whether or not this would have been a good thing.  Foreign language films have always been implicitly disqualified from being declared Best Picture, so much so that they have their own special category - so why not be honest and disqualify them explicitly?<br/><br/>So let's rule ""Life is Beautiful"" out.  GIVEN the remaining nominees (""Elizabeth"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Thin Red Line""), I don't see how anyone could deny that ""Shakespeare in Love"" was at least a plausible choice.  Some people are understandably upset that Miramax ""bought"" the award, by advertising heavily, but this has been going on for decades - and at least Miramax had the grace to keep its advertising out of the film itself, unlike certain other entrants I could mention.  This is a film that was made first and entered into competition afterwards.  There's not a trace of pomposity about it, not a single character pointing out to us, for the benefit of the judges, that the script is profound.  Grandiloquent posturing has often won in the past (""Dances with Wolves"", ""Unforgiven"", ""Forrest Gump""), and I'm rather pleased that, at least this once, it didn't.  I'm also pleased that the award went to, loosely speaking, a comedy.  THAT hadn't happened for 21 years, and I'm not sure it will ever happen again.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't see how it could be that there are people who actually RESENT a film so beautiful, charming, and intelligent.  Granted, it tells us nothing about how Shakespeare created his plays, but how could it?  And would it be cinematically interesting even if it could?  I doubt it. ""Topsy-Turvy"" (possibly the best picture of 1999, by the way, and not even nominated) went into the nuts and bolts of staging a theatrical work in greater and more loving detail than any other film I've seen, but on the topic of primary creation - how Gilbert came up with his words, how Sullivan came up with his notes - it was silent.  What was there to say?<br/><br/>""Shakespeare in Love"" is more concerned with what Shakespeare has in common with everyone else, and also what he has in common with other artists - even the untalented ones.  That it's not a serious historical account is established by the working title it offers of ""Romeo and Juliet"" - ""Romeo and Ethyl, the Pirate's Daughter"".  (It's a joke straight out of ""Blackadder"".)  The point is that we see a plausible picture of a genius living and breathing, which he does the same way everyone else does.<br/><br/>By the way, if you want to see Geoffrey Rush at his best, in his best role, this is it.  He's perfect in his small role of eccentric theatre manager (although he fails to steal any scenes from more capable performers like Judi Dench, Joseph Fiennes, Colin Firth...).  He should stick to this kind of thing.  There is, as everyone has noticed, a distinct shortage of good character actors."

","It's a shame that any living person would ever look at this movie and think it to be overrated.

The more Shakespeare you know, the more references in the film you're going to get, and the more impressed you're going to be.<br/><br/>It's an interesting hybrid, in the days of Post-Modernism when more movies are just referencing other movies.

","When I originally saw the previews for this movie, I said to myself, ""What a STUPID idea""  I am not the typical male who thinks that Shakespeare wrote War and Peace, I have acted in Shakespearian plays, read and enjoyed many sonnets, and revere Shakespeare as the greatest dramatist, poet, and writer in the english language.  It is because of my great respect for the man that I thought a romantic comedy based on Shakespeare's struggles through life and love was a horrible, stupid, terrible concept.  That is when the critics praise and wonderful word of mouth made me second guess my initial evaluation.  I thought, ""Well maybe if they are respectful to his life and really do an exploration of Shakespeare's life, then it could be great!""<br/><br/>I should have stuck with my original impression to save time.  What I saw was what I expected to see, a romantic comedy.  And a mediocre one at that. Not that funny, not that romantic, not that good.  Paltrow and Rush were Oscar Nominated  for such mediocre performances and Judi Dench, while wonderful, was on screen for 5 minutes at the most, which classifies her role as a cameo not a supporting roll, did not deserve her oscar.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was the script.  COME ON!!!!   I am all for the suspension of disbelief, but when you take this much artistic license with a HISTORICAL FIGURE, then you are just pushing it.  I can just imagine Tom Stoppard waking up one morning and saying, ""How about I b********* the life of the greatest playwright of all time.""  Why would you use Shakespeare as the main character in a romantic comedy?   It does not make sense to me.<br/><br/>

A toss of the head, a withering glance and some cutting remarks immediately establish her character.  We hang on her every word, every movement.  I found the character of young Will Shakespeare lacking in a certain warmth.  After all,Shakespeare was a man who could write on every aspect of human nature.  I thought the bustling crowd scenes were well executed down to the last detail and the Rose and Curtain theatres had just the right atmosphere.  The dialogue infused with Shakespeare's words from his famous plays was clever script-writing and should appeal to a wide audience.  But on the whole, despite some good individual performances, I expected more from an Academy Award winner for best film.  It must have been a nightmare for the director handling those energetic crowd scenes which he did so well. But perhaps he should have spent more time on Joseph's interpretation of young Will Shakespeare."

"Mike-469","10","0","1","9 October 1999"," Very Disappointing
","My first thought when I heard the plot of this movie was one word:  hokey. I mean, a woman dresses up as a man to be onstage and inspire Shakespeare, etc.  Come on -- we've had movie characters cross-dressing to get a job from ""Tootsie"" to ""Victor/Victoria"" to ""Mrs. Doubtfire.""  I couldn't understand how a plot like that could generate such hype.  But a friend of mine assured me that it was great, so I saw it anyway.  Unfortunately, my opinion of the film did not change much after I saw it.<br/><br/>Nothing about the plot was original.  I kept waiting for a fantastic, new plot twist that would make me sit up and say ""wow.""  It just didn't happen though.  I mean, who could not watch this movie and just *know* that there would be a crisis right before the play that would threaten that (gasp!) the play might not go on?  Come on.  This movie wasn't all bad though.  The costumes and the settings were great and very colorful, and the directing was strong.  Also, the film did have some nice inside-jokes about literary characters, etc, such as the real reason why Chris Marlowe was killed, and some funny parodies of the Hollywood lifestyle, etc.  But inside jokes do not a great movie make.<br/><br/>Now, I don't want to sound like this is a bad movie.  In fact, it was a rather enjoyable way to spend two hours or so.  But it simply didn't live up to the hype.  My thoughts on why it won the Oscar:  maybe the voters heard the English accents and fell into the usual American trap of assuming that anything with an English accent is automatically brilliant, intelligent and witty.  Or, they could have heard that Tom Stoppard wrote the script and done the same thing based on his reputation as being one of the premier playwrites of our day.  Perhaps Hollywood just loved the jokes on itself that were in the film and couldn't resist giving it all those Oscars. Whatever was the reason, I think it's  a shame that this film took many Oscars that other films deserve.  I would like to see how this movie stands up twenty years or so down the road.  Which movie will ultimately be more memorable -- this pleasant, slightly above run-of-the-mill comedy, or great movies like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""La Vita E Bella,"" or ""A Thin Red Line""? I think time will tell."
"GFoster","9","0","1","2 October 1999"," A great film
","Although a little over-rated and it doesn't deserve all those Oscars, Shakespeare In Love is still a brilliant, funny, romantic film with excellent acting all round, including a brilliant turn from comedian Martin Clunes as Dick Burbidge. The setting is excellent as the times of 16th century England are captured effectively in the scenery and costumes. Joseph Fiennes is great as William Shakespeare who falls in love with Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola de Lesseps. Problems arise as Will is already married to Anne Hathaway and Viola can't go anywhere near him because he is at the theatre all the time and women aren't allowed on stage. Viola then dresses up as a man and Will thinks that he (Viola) is gay. But it all gets sorted out and they both love each other dearly and have to keep their affair quiet as Viola is due to marry Lord Wessex, played by Colin Firth. It is a delightful tale which shouldn't be missed even if it puts you off with the word 'Shakespeare'."
"dave-593","Null","0","1","1 October 1999"," SHAKESPEARE COMES OF AGE
","""Shakespeare in Love"" is ostensibly made for the MTV generation.  Plodding and cloying, this shaggy dog comedy panders to the quasi middlebrow audience: it goes out of its way to reward those who are able to identify anything that resembles an Elizabethan in-joke.  Call it a self-esteem booster or plain I- know-something-you-don't-because-I-took-English-Lit-101. Whatever the case, the film readily sacrifices wit for farce, and assumes an ill-fitting disposition that calls for tentative and clumsy attempts at bowdlerizing Shakespeare for the common age.

"Macho-7","8","0","1","28 September 1999"," SiL; The best movie 1998?
","First and foremost, I would like to point out that ""Shakespeare in Love"" got 5 Academy Awards, including ""Best Movie"". This resulted, naturally, in an enormous hype connected with the movie. Therefore, I had great expectations, when I went to the theatre to see it. Luckily, I was not too much disappointed. The movie was a beautifully controlled comedy, with excellent cast, astounding costumes and a sweet and delightful screenplay. In a movie a well-considered cast is of greatest importance. In my opinion, Joseph Fiennes, who is the leading actor, shows a great depth in his role as Will Shakespeare. He does not overplay and his accent and charisma is outstanding. It is definitely his breakthrough-role, and I think that he, in time, will be an accepted artist. The character, William Shakespeare, is well made, even though he does not develop much throughout the story. Nevertheless, it is great to see how Viola De Lesseps affects his competence of writing. Shakespeare is not capable of making any progress with his life on his own. He needs help from his lover and his friends. Among his friends it is significant to mention Ned Alleyn, who is played by Ben Affleck. Ned is the leader of a small theatre company, as travels around England to get jobs where available. This, alongside with many other things, tells a lot about the theatre line of business at the end of the 16th century. I can also mention that only male actors where allowed to perform at that time, which the film also points out. Finally, the film tells about for instance a priest's point of view. It is clearly that the priest finds the two theatres in London as a profanation. The above-mentioned examples indicate that Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard had done their homework, the description of the theatres and actors is very similar to the way it really happened in those days. Gwyneth Paltrow, who got an Oscar for best actress in a leading role, is playing a double role. She is both playing the noble Viola De Lesseps and the actor (!) Thomas Kent. As Viola De Lesseps, she is, besides being gorgeous, very convincing. You cannot help but sympathise with her all the way through the movie. Viola is a strong character, and she is not the typical, noble snob. She has a great heart, and her feelings about Will are true. Unfortunately, her destiny is already decided for her. She knows that she cannot prevent it. Therefore, I think the ending of the movie is excellent. It would be too much Hollywood, if Will and Viola had each other at the end. In the 16th century such marriages could not take place, and this is being told in a simple but heartbreaking way in the movie. The last character I will mention is Queen Elizabeth played by Judi Dench. Dench got an Oscar for the ""Best Actress in a supporting Role"" for this role. This is, in my opinion, also understandable. She acts very ""solemnly"" in the movie, and when she speaks, she really shows her huge authority. Elizabeth, as a character, seems to be a good queen and also very generous. She sees that Viola will not be happy with her fiancé, Lord Wessex, and she understands Viola's affair with Shakespeare. Maybe the queen is a bit too nice; I do not think that a ""real"" queen would act like she does in the ending. Nevertheless, there is something about the queen, as you cannot put a finger on, which is - of course - the costumes! On the contrary, the script is not that good. It is filled with clichés and small laughs, where some of them seem unnecessary. It is a romantic comedy, I know, but why is it not possible to write a script that really takes the viewers breath away. I have seen quite a few love comedies, and I have very seldom been positively surprised by the plotline. ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a wonderful film, but all in all, it does, due to the script, fall in to the category of ""mainstream"" movies. It will never be a classic, as for instance ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Shindler's List"" or if I should mention a love story: ""Casablanca"" and ""Good Will Hunting"". The themes as the film tries to point out are easily interpreted. One of the themes is, as mentioned before, the life of an actor or playwright in London in the 16th century. Another theme is the romance between a poor, no-good playwright and the noble countess; such relationship is of course a taboo. It is an overused theme, which we last saw in James Cameron's  ""epic"" lovestory ""Titanic"". In fact ""Shakespeare in Love"" can be compared to ""Titanic"" in many ways, as the two films have many things in common. The small jokes, the differences between rich and poor, the hype surrounding the movies and of course the Academy Award for the ""Best Movie"", which certainly shows what way Hollywood are going these years. I do not think that ""Shakespeare in Love"" or ""Titanic"" deserved that Oscar. In 1997 it should have been ""L.A. Confidential"", which is a crime movie with several plot turns; a ""real"" movie, or ""Good Will Hunting"", which has maybe one of the best scripts ever written. In 1998 there can not be much doubt that ""Saving Private Ryan"" was the absolutely best movie, maybe together with ""Life is Beautiful"". ""Life is Beautiful"" is, as ""Shakespeare in Love"", a romantic comedy, it is just that ""Life is Beautiful"" is funnier, has a more interesting plot and, maybe mostly important for a lovestory, it is much more touching!<br/><br/>When this has been said, I think it is time to make my conclusion. First of all, I think it is a very good movie. The acting is almost perfect, and the costumes, photography and music are of very high standards. The script is okay, but could certainly have been better, not to mention the dialogues that are somewhat naive, mainly because of the small jokes and clichés. Altogether, ""Shakespeare in Love"" has scenes as form a synthesis. You cannot help but be amazed, when you see the love scene, where Viola and Shakespeare, has a narrative dialogue from ""Romeo and Juliet"", while the camera moves softly around the bed and the most beautiful music flights towards your ear as carried by wings of angels! At the end of the 16th century Shakespeare wrote a beautiful play. At the end of the 20th century John Madden made a film about it, but - alas - it was not as good as the work of the true master - not as good as the never forgettable William Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

Neither dramatic nor very funny, Shakespeare in Love makes a mockery of history and Gwenyth Paltrow gives a performance worthy of abhorring as Viola De Lesseps. The minute she comes on screen, you sense the phoniness of the performance, and by the end of the movie you realize this vexatious twit has done basically nothing to inspire Shakespeare besides f**king him every once and a while.  Oh yes, let me run out and write the best play every to grace the page cuz i just got laid.  Nope, don't think so.  When it comes down to it, Shakespeare in Love is really a movie hinging on one big premise with nothing to back it up, and it wears out fast.  With only a handful of good one-liners and performances from both Rush, Paltrow, Affleck, and Firth that all quickly wear out their welcome, I don't see how anyone could find this poorly assembled piece of celluloid better than the massive and heart-wrenching epic Saving Private Ryan.  Ask anyone of those Shakespeare in Love 'fans' out there why Judi Dench won Best Supporting Actress.  Watch them not be able to answer it.  She's on screen for 8 minutes at most, and half the time the audience is supposed to just sit and marvel in her wonderful makeup and costumes.  Do you want to know the number one reason why Shakespeare in Love was a bad movie?  It was written by the guy who did Cutthroat Island.  The other writer was the guy who wrote Brazil.  Brazil was a great movie mind you, but it was a movie without a point; a psychological rush.  If you cross a science fiction acid trip of a movie and a film where Geena Davis plays a pirate, do you really think you're going to get an Oscar-worthy epic picture?

","Watching ""Shakespeare in Love"" was like falling in love for the first time. The passionate enthusiasm of the characters, the gorgeous costumes and masterful script swept me along until the close of the film. I do not know where to begin when discussing this delightful film. I adored the little ""in"" jokes, such as the wording ""Stratford-Upon-Avon"" on Shakespeare's mug, or the man on the street discussing a rose, and how by any other name it would bear the same sweet fragrance. There was the classic balcony scene, swordplay, and passionate romance. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes made a wonderfully charming couple, although I will admit that the film could have cut down on the nudity just a bit. But other than that, it was a flawless piece. Geoffrey Rush, dastardly evil in ""Les Miserables,"" was simply hilarious as a theatre owner in financial straits. I loved his quirky facials and mock terror. Finally, Dame Judi Dench's performance as Queen Elizabeth was so subtle that it nearly caught one offguard. Yet it too was quick, witty and quite worthy of the Oscar it won her.<br/><br/>The film's script was a masterpiece in itself, weaving the beatiful wordplay of Shakespeare with some of the brilliance of today. There were plenty of plot twists and unexpected circumstances to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. And I believe that the ending of the film was simply perfect. I recently appeared in a production of ""What You Will,"" and it was refreshing to see a familiar moment on screen. Clearly, ""Shakespeare in Love"" earned its Oscar for Best Picture. I sincerely hope that it will remain a favorite for years to come."

","This film has one of the wittiest screenplays ever. Not only does it sustain the central conceit of the plot. It works on several other levels. The script is loaded with references to other Shakespeare works. Many of which require multiple viewings to catch. Take it from one who has read *ALL* of the plays that there is much to savor here. Anyone who complains about historical inaccuracies should automatically have their opinion discounted because they obviously didn't 'get it'. This film is intended as an affectionate tongue-in-cheek love letter to Elizabethan theater. OF COURSE there are anachronisms. It's part of the fun. Did anyone else notice the coffee mug on Will's desk that said 'Present of Stratford Upon Avon'? How about him going to what appears to be a session of psychoanalysis? The structure of the plot itself is ingeniously crafted to echo 'Romeo and Juliet' but in subtle, indirect ways. This film is alive in every sense of the world. Anyone who refers to it as a chick-flick or flighty entertainment is not at a very high level of artistic engagement. As a matter of fact they are just at the right level to be impressed by the banal platitudes of 'Saving Private Ryan'."

","Trivial. Inane. Predictable. Unoriginal. Trite. Just few of many words for which I describe ""Shakespeare In Love."" This will not change the amount of Academy Awards it received. What's done is obviously done. But it will certainly stand as an embarrassment to society. How many Oscars did it actually receive? Do you remember the movie that sniped the ""Best Picture"" Oscar in 1997? See, even that is leaving our memory! We don't want to remember those shameful events in the history of our time: Slavery, the Holocaust, Nixon's stand on Vietnam. Yet they still existed, and will be remembered as the inhumanity and bastardness of mankind. Unfortunately, I have to compare that to the ignorance and selfishness of the Academy of Motion Pictures.<br/><br/>Gee, where do I start. How about where all the Oscars went. Judi Dench received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for sitting on a chair and laughing, and as far as I could tell, for nothing much else. Gwyneth Paltrow won the Best Actress Oscar for reading her lines and flaunting her slender flat-chested body, and for a performance that makes Bo Derek look like Emma Thompson. The script, which suffered from emptyness and repetition (how many times did we have to hear the line ""A plague on both our houses""?) got the screenplay Oscar, a travesty which could of been written by a hyperactive 4th grader. Lastly, (or at least to sum it up) the Best Picture Oscar was slapped down on a ""romance film"" which exposes playright William Shakespeare as being a plagiarist, and getting the idea of""Romeo and Juliet"" from a love affair he supposedly had with Gwyneth Paltrow. Spare me.<br/><br/>I'm baffled that people say this is a good portrayal of 16th Century England. No tooth paste was around back then, and bathing wasn't too sophisticated either. Yet everyone in the movie looked so clean-cut; some even appeared as if they jumped right out of a GAP commercial. The sets were obviously Hollywood sets. Everyone was playing themselves. The romance between Fiennes and Paltrow had the same amount of chemistry as the gloomy days of Charles and Di, and all the scenes and continuity were predictable. I also never laughed, despite the promotion of this as being a ""comedy"". For instance, take the scene at the begining where Phillip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) has a debt to pay and a group of loan sharks threaten to burn his feet or cut his nose off. I didn't find any comic relief in this scene. Was I supposed to?<br/><br/>I have a confession to make. I only saw 30 minutes of this movie and I didn't rewind it when I returned it to the rental place. If you're wondering why I'm writing this review if I didn't watch the whole thing, it's because I knew what was going to happen for at least every 5 minutes. That's not entertaining; that's irratating. So, what's the point? The majority of the public wanted ""Saving Private Ryan"" to get the much deserved Best Picture Oscar. That sampling fell on deaf ears, and the AMP took it upon themselves to choose on their own. If I ever find out the group of personalities that made that decision, I'm never going to watch their movies (or anything affiliated with them) again. I mean, this is totally ridiculous! I've made the same pact about watching future televised Oscar ceremonies. There's really no point. They're going to pick a romance period movie with an anglo-saxon cast as the best picture. It's been working like this for over a half a decade now! Why, why bother? If a poorly written, cliched sappy romance is what qualifies as ""best picture of the year"", I've made up my mind.

","I know a lot of moviegoers will probably disagree with me but I really did think Shakespeare in Love was the funniest movie of 1998.  You can tell the screenwriters, Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, had a lot of fun writing the screenplay.  From the opening scene where Geoffrey Rush is having his feet bar-b-qued to the ending where Judi Dench says, ""Too late, too late,"" after her servants fail to cover a puddle of water--I knew I was in for a ""rollercoaster"" of laughs.  And it doesn't take an English major to get the jokes--that's another great thing about this movie.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" may have been expertly directed, but ""Shakespeare in Love"" deserved the Best Picture Oscar for its humor, romance, theatrical and English history, and story on one of the greatest writers who ever lived:  Shakespeare!  The Academy Awards seldom acknowledge ""arthouse"" films--let's celebrate when they do."
"Tin Man-5","Null","0","1","11 August 1999"," This beat Private Ryan?
","""Shakespeare in Love"" is a nice little movie, featuring nice little actors and a nice little movie. I rather enjoyed it, in all honesty, but I really don't feel that it was up to par to win seven Academy Awards, and I am especially insulted that it could ever beat ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the masterpiece epic of World War II, for best picture.<br/><br/>It's an interesting idea, about Shakespeare writing ""Romeo and Juliet"" because he was inspired by an actual love affair. It's borders between romantic comedy and historical piece, and it works pretty good. The cast is good (especailly Judi Dench) and the direction is nice for the balance of genres. Great costumes, too. <br/><br/>However, there are some major flaws. Gregory Rush is barely used. He has a few nice scenes in the beginning, but then he is reduced to a backdrop. Guys, if you're going to have Rush's excellence in a film, USE him. And just the opposite for Ben Affleck. What the heck was he doing in this film? He reminded me that episode of Seseme Street with Julia Roberts...Out of place and fully aware of it.... Oh, nevermind. You get the picture.<br/><br/>The whole idea is also inaccurate. Obviously, the writers didn't realize (or they chose to ignore) the fact that Romeo and Juliet was already a popular storyline at the time William wrote it, and he just redid it for the play. So that makes this whole movie impossible. With this knowledge in mind, this was a real dissapointment, considering it was played like it could have possibly been inspired from real events.<br/><br/>Mr. Speilberg, I'd like to apologize on behalf of all of the people who know that S.P.R. should have won. I swear, someone paid the people off for this one to win best picture. It was a fun little film, but certainly not a masterpiece like your epic. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>*** out of *****"

","""Shakespeare In Love"" is a great film-- funny and an instant classic. It tells the story of Romeo and Juliet, with Will as Romeo and Viola as Juliet.

It is very romantic and very hilarious at times. <br/><br/>Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Phiennes, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench are all really great.. especially Paltrow. One of my favorite quotes is when Romeo is frantic about his play, and Philip Henslow says ""The show must-"" and Will says ""Go on!""<br/><br/>All in all this is a great movie that very much deserved to win Best Picture.<br/><br/>My rating: 9 out of 10"

My only regret is that I hadn't seen it in the theatre before the academy awards so that I could know what the entire audience was truly cheering about. I hope that Gwyneth Paltrow continues to choose roles that allow us to see what a wonderful actress she is. I loved the way they combined some of the story lines of Shakespeare plays to add realism (inspiration) to the movie. Pleasantville might have been a tad more original but S.i.L. was truely the better picture. I enjoyed S.P.R. but it didn't need to win. It was a remarkable film in all aspects.

","This is an fun little movie, and a fine companion piece to ""Rosencrantz"" by Stoppard.  It's full of humor and romance and all the acting is first-rate. Lots of little ""in"" jokes please those of us who love Shakespeare, and there are lots of insane little touches (an Elizabethan psychologist, for instance) give it levels of meaning.  One quibble:  there's too much graphic sex, most of it thrown in as a cheap laugh.  This makes it quite unsuitable for children, who would probably be well served by this movie if they could see it, as an introduction to Shakespeare as the equally unrealistic (and exquisite) ""Amadeus"" was to the music of Mozart.  It should've gotten an NC-17 rating for these absolutely unnecessary shenanigans.  Sex in movies is always funnier, and also more romantic and even sexier, when it's implied rather than shown (and here I don't refer to the scenes between Shakespeare and Viola, but we see more of Gwyneth Paltrow than is absolutely necessary. Other than that, it's a fine movie for adults, and if they are literate and not snobbish (a rather slim number, but we're out there) it is an enjoyable sex romp."

I did, in fact, see all of the other nominated Best Actress candidates, and I have to say that Gwyneth was deserving of her award (wish there had been a tie with her and Cate, though).  Judi Dench was also highly worthy.

","Much conjecture has been made regarding the 'missing years' of William Shakespeare's life. This movie attempts to give one an idea of what occurred in his life after he left his wife in the country. To make any comparison to the Romeo and Juliet ART film will Leonardo DiCaprio and Clair Danes is to compare gourmet cooking to automobiles.  Shakespeare In Love is indeed a romantic comedy with an ending that is left to imagination. On its own it displays that passion and love go hand in hand and is indeed in a class all its own. It depicts the Elizabethan era wonderfully, without the correct pronunciation of the speech of that era (if so we would not understand the movie very well). The fact that the play, Romeo and Juliet, was the focus is to show what may have inspired William: The love between Will and Viola. So, to Kane-C in Finland......realize this movie has NOTHING to do with the previous two Romeo and Juliet plays: the first was drama, the second and art film. This film is filled with comedy, romance and drama. I highly recommend this movie to those who have passion for passion."

It was the closest thing to ""the Emperor's new clothes"" syndrome that I've experienced in a long, long, time. Talk about publicity and a few good reviews snowing the public!  I found this film neither well written nor very witty or well performed by its leads.  It simply isn't very entertaining.  If this is supposedly one of the best films of the year, then the movies are in deep trouble. After seeing this movie I was particularly stunned that Gwyneth Paltrow had won the Oscar for best actress.  Didn't anyone see Fernanda Montenegro in the superb ""Central Station""?  Paltrow's Shakespearean performance as Juliet was laughable, about on a par with a sophomore college production and to try to see her as Shakespeare's muse was the only real laugh I got in the entire two hours.  In addition, Joseph Finnes played the bard like the lead in a television sitcom and I kept waiting for the laugh track to help him achieve his comic effects. I think what really, finally, annoyed me about this so called comedy was how self satisfied, pseudo-intellectual and manipulative it was (very like many of Tom Stoppard's plays, come to think of it).  That is, it was if the filmmakers clearly aimed their picture at an upper middle class, middle brow audience who would get the obvious Shakespearean references, feel good about that Shakespeare 101 class they once attended, and then get swept away by the tepid, light weight, undemanding romance.  Great film comedies have a broader appeal than this and the greatest, like Shakespeare's plays, attract and amuse all sorts of audiences.  In addition, again unlike any of Shakespeare's plays, there wasn't one original idea in the piece or one honest emotion.  The one joke, repeated over and over, was the long life of various theatrical cliche's.  If that's the best ""wit"" Hollywood can come up with, I'll stick to ""Peanuts"". Shakespeare's plays are so much better then this film that I, for one, felt insulted for his memory."

","The film is indeed a creative way to do Romeo and Juliet, but many viewers may see it as just that... another Romeo and Juliet.  Indeed, the most emotional parts of the film are the direct quotes from Shakespeare's work. The rest seems almost like filler. Paltrow, Affleck, and others have commented on how ""historically accurate"" the film is.  This seems to be true for the costume and set design, however, major historical mistakes seem to be evident.  For example, Jamestown, Virginia (the first settlement in Virginia) wasn't founded until 1607, some years after Shakespeare wrote R&J (ca.1595).  Even if this estimation is incorrect, Shakespeare would have to have been at least 43 when Virginia was colonized, much older than the young star of the film.<br/><br/>Also notable is the effort made to darken the Queen's teeth, showing how poor hygiene technology was.  However, all the ""main"" characters have pearly whites. This condensing of time, and other factors made me feel that I was just watching another rendition of Romeo and Juliet, done yet another way.

Yes, we know Shakespeare (probably) suffered in his personal and professional life, but it's unthinkable for this Shakespeare lover that he was 'running dry' before meeting the maiden (Paltrow) that inspired Romeo and Juliet. This movie is an amusing, well done costume drama of the heady, bawdy Elizabethan Era enhanced by glimpses of Paltrow's bare breasts, but the film's contrived hustle and bustle, and the juvenile hi-jinx of the lovers obscured many of The Bard's great lines. For great Shakespeare you MUST see Al Pacino's  ""Looking for Richard""----Pacino's troupe's faithful, powerful portrayal of the best scenes of Richard III without any distractions to dilute the experience (including, ironically, most of the minor scenes of the play). The aging, intense Pacino is perfect as the embittered and driven King Richard."

","This movie makes Titanic look obnoxious.  I loved this movie.  It was incredibly intelligent and clever.  Enough said.  Do yourself a favor and go see it!"

","Superbly enjoyable film.  The supporting cast was great to the last person and was a testimonial to the value and pleasure of words well crafted. Left the theater not only pleased, but intrigued by the strange and wonderful lead in to Twelth Night. I'll see it again next weekend."

","I'm sorry but I could not get into this film.<br/><br/>With all the hype, I was led to believe this was a movie for non-Shakespeare lovers. Not true. It is pure, unadulterated Shakespeare. If you know nothing of Shakespeare, forget this film as a possible evening's entertainment. I would suggest you need an in-depth knowledge of the bard's works to appreciate this script. I haven't and I didn't. I struggled to keep awake for the first half. The second half had me longing for the end...and the ending is the best part of the movie. I tried to like it...honestly. But, Mr Spielberg, you have nothing to fear here at Oscar time !"

","I was really touched by this movie.  At first I was apprehensive that it would turn out to be another ""English Patient"" (which for me meant an agonizing wait squirming in my chair wondering if this was finally the end of the whole tragic, dour affair), but I was very pleasantly surprised.  The love portrayed in this movie is what it is all about, not the pretentious, miserable stuff of the English Patient.  Anyway, I was not much for Shakespeare when I was forced to read it in school, but this movie gave me an appreciation for the beauty of his prose.  I especially liked the expressions on the faces of the audience when it finally came time to perform Romeo and Juliet.  That's how I felt about this movie, too.  The only thing I can't figure out is which was Ms. Paltrow's true hair- the gold or brown? I can't see how one could have covered up the other, either way."
"Kess","Null","0","1","17 February 1999"," Everyone credited except Shakespeare
","This film suffers from multi-crediting, a syndrome in which film-makers have their own names appear repeatedly on the credits, depite the fact that they only did one job. For example, in Shakespeare in Love I think the director took three credits, one at the start and two at the end. The producers certainly had a couple apiece, as did the writers. I can visualise the delicate negotiations as each tried to ensure that it got maximum exposure - very like the actors who were so lovingly lampooned in the film itself.<br/><br/>In fact, the only name that was conspicuously absent from the credits was that of Shakespeare himself, presumably because he could not fight his corner along with Stoppard and co.<br/><br/>This is a pity, since a significant portion of the script is by Shakespeare, and the film frequently uses his original lines, pure and unadulterated, to get its emotional force across. Surely this would have been worth a nod in the credits.<br/><br/>It's also particularly unfair since, in my opinion, Shakespeare's lines were by far the best in the film. Unlike the scriptwriters' efforts, his words did not lurch from slushy romantic cliches ('a thousand times goodbye...') to archly modern witticisms ('I had Marlowe in my boat...'). The use of anachronism for its own sake is such a cheap trick. It will almost always get a snigger out of the audience, and it exists to do no more than that. It has the air of tacked-on laughs, rather than a sense of comedy inherent to the spirit of the whole film."
"Kabumpo","5","0","1","8 February 1999"," Good writing; clichÃ©ed plot
","What stopped me from liking this film as much as I should was its plot of Viola in disguised as a man in order to act, because I have seen this type of plot so many times before on countless kid shows from the seventies through the nineties.  This turnoff, which really does not seem to be old hat in adult fare, could well be unique to me because I have seen so much of that material both as a child an as an adult, but even so, Stoppard is a brilliant writer, though the fact that this is a collaboration excuses the fact that it's not quite up to _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_. _Brazil_, which he co-wrote was better than this, too, but I don't mean to knock this film so much.  The film is amply packed with inside references to Shakespeare and a great integration of the plots of _The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet_ with its supposedly real-life plot. (In actuality, he wrote 11 plays between _R&J_ and _Twelfth Night, Or What You Will, but that's not egregious license, either.)  Stoppard's inimitable talent is his ability to make the writing seem more contemporary to Shakespeare than to our own time, and to find jokes that are still funny therein.  Judi Dench of Madden's earlier _Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown_ gives a succinctly powerful performance as Queen Elizabeth:  very commanding.  The bit about the plot is really the only thing negative I have to say about it, simply because it seems a shame that something this well written should be dragged down by something like that."
"Cicero-6","10","0","1","14 January 1999"," Superb, but...!
","Shakespeare in Love was a superb film, despite the fact that it was a work of fiction.  Gwyneth Paltrow turning in an absolutely exquisite performance. Colin Firth also turned in an outstanding performance.  Joseph Fiennes looked a bit odd in the role as Shakespeare - his looks are reptilian.  I think he would do better to wait a few years and play the lead in Othello.<br/><br/>Finally, one would wonder whether there was a subtle message in the film about the acceptability of homosexuality, given the scenes of men kissing men in the movie."
