","It's quite sad to read some of the reviews of this film. ""full of clich√©s"" ""typical weak war film"" etc. I would like for the writers of such comments to look at the film they ""coughed up their reddies"" for, and ask what they were really after? Do they know what the film was about? The director's aim was to create an honest depiction of a real life event. To tell the story of a battle and war in a way that would make people who weren't there understand what it may have been like. To bring home the stark realisation of how scary the battlefield would be, and explore the wider picture of how families, and even the enemy were affected by events too. Many of the words used by the dying men are documented as being the actual words. In the editors commentary, he explains ""these were the true dying words 'tell my wife I love her'. In that situation, it is the reality of what is on people's minds. I'm sorry they couldn't have come up with something more melo-dramatic for the theatre audience."" The line that really bought it home for me though was that soldiers who had fought in that battle thanked the director. They said he had managed to show the realities of an event in their lives that they had, to that point, never managed to fully explain to their families. If the people who were there say this is a realistic account of events and emotions, then that's the best accolade a film can have. I was scared and moved by it and would recommend it highly. PS. to the plot critics out there... would you rather they sexed up a true story? Surely that would be a grave tragedy."
"gftbiloxi","10","505","594","17 May 2005"," A Vietnam Veteran Contemplates WE WERE Soldiers
","I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal. Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it. I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films. He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it. And about one and all he says: ""It wasn't like that.""<br/><br/>He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought. He said, ""They finally got it. That's what it was like. All the details are right. The actors were just like the men I knew. They looked like that and they talked like that. And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew."" The he was silent for a long time. At last he said, ""You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off? Something like that happened to me once. It was at a helicopter crash. I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off. It looked just like that, too. I've never told any one about it."" In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground. And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful. Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film. It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.<br/><br/>Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds. Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield. The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue. The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a ""you are there"" quality that is very powerful.<br/><br/>I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place. And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd. But these are nit-picky quibbles. WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie. I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: ""It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie. I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie. But they pretty much get everything right. That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen."" Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"Mike-575","10","197","248","24 February 2002"," Powerful and moving, not a film for everyone however
","I was privileged to see a preview of Mel Gibson's new film ""We Were Soldiers"" based upon the book written by his real life character, Lt. Col. Harold Moore, along with Joe Galloway. I attended a showing along with numerous other Viet Nam vets and it would seem that there were as many opinions about the movie as there were viewers.  Like the war itself, each person in attendance probably had some personal experiences that the movie brought back from that deep, and sometimes distant, place we have put them.<br/><br/>The movie was almost overwhelmingly graphical, but afterwards I realized this was instrumental in the telling of the story.  For the movie is truly about the leadership that Col. Moore brought to his men of the 1st of the 7th, and his determination that they would not suffer the fate of the French in Viet Nam, nor his own unit's most infamous battle, that of Custer's Stand at Little Big Horn.<br/><br/>It was his determination and commitment that his men be as highly trained, as strongly molded as a unit, and most importantly as well lead as possible that stands out. This determination is obviously rooted in his deeply abiding belief that military leaders shall never forget that when they lead men into war, many of those men will never come back alive, but that those who lead shall never abandon them, even in their shared darkest hours.<br/><br/>And while the movie highly succeeds in conveying the horror and tragedy that war is....has been...and always shall be, it was more difficult for me to realize that our War Department and Army could have been so callous as to have delegated the responsibility of notifying next-of-kin of the death of their loved ones to the local Yellow Cab company. Then I realized that in late 1965 it was all so new and no one knew that this war was going to grow and consume so many young American lives over the next nine years.<br/><br/>The two most significant scenes in the movie for me were firstly, the scene when the course of the battle teeters on the brink of either disaster or success and the most important communication that Col. Moore's superiors have to convey is that General Westmoreland would like for him to leave the battlefield and fly to Saigon so the general can have a briefing. This more than anything pointed out how tragically we were doomed to failure in Viet Nam due to the political will, not the military will, being in control. The second most significant scene was in the airport where one soldier is pushing his buddy through the concourse and the voice over says...""They did not fight for God.....country.....right. They fought for each other"", a fact that every Viet Nam vet would attest to.<br/><br/>This a movie worth seeing. It is another testament, with a worthy cinematographic effort, to the futility and absurdity of war, and how that among madness can be greatness. It is a movie that will unlikely leave the viewer devoid of emotion.  What those emotions may be are as likely to be as highly personal, as the strength of their feeling."

","Ever since 1970 when I finished my third tour of combat duty with the Marines in Viet Nam I have been waiting for a film that reflected the American Fighting Man in the Viet Nam war as an American Fighting Man; not a drugged-out, anti-war whiner. Well this is it. The movie is non-stop action after the first fifteen minutes of character development is finished. Having experienced what it is like to be over-run by the NVA during the third week of my first VN tour I can tell you that this movie does an excellent job of showing the excitement, tension, exhaustion, chaos, and courage of an extended battle. While this is by no means the best war movie I have ever seen, it is the first Viet Nam war movie which has provided me with a sense of satisfaction after leaving the theater. Mel Gibson turns in a good performance, Sam Elliot is a bit stiff. The wives of the soldiers are believable. Including a bit of the NVA's attitude about the war adds a balanced flavor to the film. Overall I would say that you will experience at least a small part the intensity of war if you go to this movie. I took my female companion and she was shocked, touched, and thrilled with it. As Americans, we need to remember that freedom is not, and never has been, free. It is always paid for with the blood of those who fight to get it, sustain it, or expand it. The politically correct may not like this film, but then who cares what they like. Thanks for making this film Mel. I've been waiting over 30 years to see it."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","154","208","23 September 2002"," Among the best war films in recent memory
","`Saving Private Ryan' redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  `Black Hawk Down' took the graphic violence to a new level, with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR, but of a duration that was almost unbearable.<br/><br/>`We Were Soldiers' is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood. In many ways, I consider this to be the most complete of the three. Writer/Director Randall Wallace (who wrote ""Braveheart"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and the screenplay for this film), takes the understanding of war to the next level, by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films, this film has the best workup, the best character development, and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.<br/><br/>Based on real events, this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD, which presented the characters in a very anonymous way, we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.<br/><br/>Of course, the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary. However, Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like `Pearl Harbor', which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure (both to his children and his men). Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played, so charismatic and heroic, that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in `The Contender' with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley, the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt, where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway, the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.<br/><br/>This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since `Full Metal Jacket'.  I rated it a 10/10. This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike."
"KristinMarie419","Null","101","136","10 March 2004"," Seeing the enemy and home in a different light
","This film is so different from the traditionally cynical (and rightly so) Vietnam War movies.  While it goes without question that this film depicts the bloody and gruesome horrors of the tragedy of the first major conflict of the war, it does so while juxtaposing the story with that of stories of the home front and the enemy.  The enemy in this film is not the animalistic, silent enemy we are used to.  We hear this enemy speak, we see his love for his family and his devotion to his cause.  While being bombarded with images of death and destruction on the battlefield, we are brought back home to see the wives as they face the death themselves.<br/><br/>
While of course not a flawless movie, it was without a doubt moving, and I highly recommend it."
"bsmith5552","9","40","51","22 August 2002"," ""They Finally Got it Right!""
","""We Were Soldiers"" is based on a real life battle of the Viet Nam war that took place in 1965 in a remote part of Viet Nam. It is based on a book by Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway who are portrayed in the film by Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper respectively.<br/><br/> The film opens with a depiction of the 1954 slaughter of French troops by the Vietnamese army. Twenty one years later Lt. Col Moore (Gibson) and his battalion of 395 men are thrust unknowingly into the same hornet's nest consisting of some 4,000 battle hardened Viet Nam regulars who have been fighting their enemies for many years. <br/><br/> Director Randall Wallace tells the story from three perspectives. Firstly from the viewpoint of the Americans. Outnumbered ten to one they face impossible odds. How Col. Moore rallies his troops and gets them to pull together as a team is a central theme of the picture. Secondly, the story is told from the viewpoint of the wives and families left behind and the problems they have to deal with. Lastly, the Vietnamese army is shown not as unfeeling monsters, but as a professional army defending their beliefs and territory.<br/><br/> The battle scenes are as realistic and convincing as any war movie that you will ever see. We suffer through the casualties both on the battlefield and at home along with the participants. The special effects are seamless and exciting.<br/><br/> Mel Gibson gives a convincing performance as Moore and if you watch the DVD, you can see the amazing similarities between the two men. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore and Keri Russell plays Barbara Geoghegan two of the wives who take on the unenviable task of delivering those dreaded telegrams to the widows from the War Department. Chris Klein plays Russell's husband Jack a new officer and father. His scene with Gibson in the base chapel is memorable. Greg Kinnear plays Captain Crandall the head of Moore's helicopter fleet. Don Duong is very effective as the Vietnamese commander. But acting cudos go to veteran Sam Elliot as the crusty Sgt. Major Plumley.<br/><br/> ""We Were Soldiers"" is a gripping Viet Nam war drama told in a way that reflects ALL of the participants in an impartially realistic way. As Hank Moore says on the DVD, They finally got it right."

","In November of 1968, the North Vietnamese still held to the old principle of ""Control the Central Highlands and you control Vietnam"". Three years to the month after the battle of LZ X-Ray, I led a LRRP (Long Range Recon Patrol)team from Duc Co south toward the Ia Drang River. We never made it to the river. Instead, we spent a very long afternoon of E&E, along with intermittent combat. Thus, my worst day of the war was within 1/2 mile of LZ X-Ray.<br/><br/>I know that area well. The locations for the movie were excellent. LTG. Moore's principle was still in use, ie, when the Air Force choppers I had contacted on an emergency radio picked us up, my foot was the last to leave the ground. (Not heroism, just the way we did it.) By the way,Those aren't ""radio towers"", they are parachute training towers on Eubanks Field, Fort Benning Ga. (Almost the same shot as in ""The Green Berets"" when Wayne saw the airborne recruits running shirtless in formation.<br/><br/>I was in college during the battle, but what I learned later I saw confirmed in the book and movie.

","I should never be surprised that people, who wouldn't recognize Principle, much less Honor, Duty, or Country if it introduced itself, see virtue as vice.  As one who served in that war, I found the movie to be factual to the point of pain.  Those who call this movie racist, lack vocabulary. or an understanding of racism.  I don't know which is sadder.  This movie tells a part of a soldier's story very well.  Soldiers march to a different drummer, how tragic that so many, today, still refuse to honor those who protected them.<br/><br/>The millions in Indo-China murdered at the hands of the Communist cry that our ""racism"" was so poorly lead at the highest civilian levels that we abandon them.  Their blood is not on my hands or on the hands of my fellow soldiers.  It is on the hands of those who are so blind they refuse to see. A valid case could be made that that there are errors in the story, certainly it doesn't tell the rest of the story, or of the next part of this battle where US casualties were 40%.  What it does tell it tells very well. Those men were volunteers, and their nobility shows in this movie.  I recommend it, especially for any who would want to understand those who served at that time."

","Behind even a forgotten war lies the memory of the fallen...This movie is definitely among the top 10 films ever made. It places the viewer right in the middle of the Vietnam War, grabs their emotions and sets them free. This movie commemorates the memories and makes heroes of each and every husband, brother, and son involved in a forgotten war- a war that was dismissed and frowned upon by the American nation as a whole. The film also takes the viewer into the home of the soldier. It invades the private life of the loved ones at home. We feel as though we are a part of the family in one scene, and the buddy of a fallen soldier in the next. A wife, child, friend of a soldier gone to war to fight for an ungrateful nation one minute, and the next the brave and loyal soldier. This moving and true story will take its viewer and bestow upon them a closer understanding, and a greater respect and gratefulness for our nation's true heroes."

"mikefigat","Null","106","172","26 October 2004"," A Movie that Depicts Real Events
","I for one am someone who was inspired to read the book ""We were Soldiers Once and Young"" after seeing this movie. WWS is about a distinct event that actually happened. SGM Plumley was a soldier's soldier, with five combat jumps in three wars and an astounding three combat infantry badges. LTC Moore was the sort of leader who could keep his head and lead his troops through the worst of battle. People who complain of clich√©s in this movie might as well complain that people in 18th century movies wear three-cornered hats.<br/><br/>To those looking for an anti-war message, it is there. When Moore goes to Division headquarters and gets his mission, he asks about projected enemy in his area of operations. The staff officer standing next to the general says ""a manageable number."" To this Moore responds with words to the effect of ""which means you have no idea."" It turns out that Moore's battalion gets dropped on top of a vastly larger enemy force (if I remember correctly, they get dropped right next to an NVA brigade). Ordinarily, it order to assure success in attack, you want to have three times the numbers of your enemy. In this case, the ratio was 4:1 going the other way. Then the battle is about how artillery and air support makes up the difference in numbers.<br/><br/>The obvious criticism here is that the command was fumbling around in the dark. At the end of the movie, the names of the 70+ men who died are prominently displayed on the screen. A military mind is not treasonous and will not disrespect its superiors, but it will let facts speak for themselves.<br/><br/>The next comment is only tangentially related to this movie. However, many voices here have taken the opportunity to vent their views on Vietnam, so I feel compelled to put things in a broader historical context. <br/><br/>There was a war that did not take place between 1945 and the fall of the Berlin wall. It would have been called WWIII. The Soviet Union and the US stood eye-to-eye for 40+ years, but did not blink. It was an ideological conflict with an evil that meant death to 50+ million people in communist countries in this century. It was conflict with a system that vastly constrained freedom. Fortunately for the world, the US finally prevailed. The struggle fought between communism and the west was fought in a variety of ways: in public relations, in sports, in propaganda, and in a series of proxy wars. In Korea, Greece, Vietnam, Afghanistan and a variety of smaller stages, East contested with West. To the people caught up in these local conflicts, these wars were absolute tragedies. However, in the grand scheme of things, these conflicts pale to insignificance when compared to the 500,000,000 who would have died in WWIII."

It shows the horrors that the families go through, as well as the men. It even shows how the ""enemy"" are people too.<br/><br/>I would like to make a personal editorial here, since I feel a great wrong has been posted about this movie by some people here... To all the people calling this flag waving propaganda, you obviously didn't watch the movie, hence I feel your votes should be removed for this film. If anything, it showed the horrors of war, how our men suffered for what was believed to be a noble mission, and how in spite of terrible odds they overcame, and the promise that ""No one will be left behind"" was kept. I know people who were there. They ended up having nightmares because it hit so close to home. This was REAL. If it were propaganda, everyone would get home and we would all be happy. You want to talk Propaganda, watch almost any John Wayne movie, or even Patton. This was not. Men died. Good Men. Family men - on both sides. Yes, the only way we survived that battle was superior technology, but it was the only reason. They were dropped into an ambush, yet they survived. Lt. Col. Morris didn't come back proud of what he did, he was just happy the mission was accomplished and they survived. Yet, he was hurt badly by every wasted life. Propaganda? You totally missed the point! Is propaganda showing how we killed our own men because of our mistakes? Lies? Tell me, were you there? I didn't think so. Unless you were there, stop with the misinformation. Your the ones spreading propaganda and lies, not the film! If you want to get picky, then I will cover one more thing. Was there some fictionalizing? Of course! they had to squeeze in over 40 characters into a few leads! Lots of stuff had to be cut, so things were glossed over and cut. I'm not saying it's perfect in character detail, but the overall story was left in tact. This was not a Hollywood story even with the changes. The plot did not deceive. That battle was as real as a recreation could be. Even Lt. Col. Hal Morris, who is retired and was there, says so. Even my ex-boss and a couple other friends, who were either at that battle or at Nam, said so. If anyone has a right to point out lies, it's our ignored and abused Nam veterans.<br/><br/>My apologies to everyone else for that rant."

I took a loooong flight just to watch the movie and it did not disappoint! Mel is as impressive as always and the rest of the cast did a great job as well, particularly Sam Elliott. Well so many great things have been said about the movie, and I can't think of anything negative to mention so I can't relate to those who did (if you have seen the movie, you'll know that most of the negative reviews here are bullsh*t).<br/><br/>Anyway, I want to point out the scene where Mel was leaving his home. That entire scene was eerily effective, I could really feel the impending danger he will face every hair on my body was rising! I liked the way the camera panned very quickly when he turned to face the road, as if Mel said ""this is really sad but I have work to do"". I think that entire scene was very very well set up. And when the action started, the tension never stopped! I now really have to read the book because I find the tactical warfare very interesting.<br/><br/>Anyway, I saw something interesting while watching the movie. There's this teenager sitting beside me, and I was really sorry for him, because he probably didn't know what he came in for. When the war action started, his eyes were really popped out! I swear to god I could have picked them with ease! His arms were gripping the armrest so hard and half his body slightly leaning forward. He was difficult not to notice even by the side of your eyesight because he looked shocked as hell. When I tried to quickly look at him (just to see if he's still breathing), he got embarrassed and leaned back to his chair. Five mins. later he was back in the same position. He was probably around 16 or 17 yrs. old so I realize that age might not be the right age to see it.<br/><br/>What really amazes me is how the movie was able to convey the chaos and horror of the war when it actually they didn't seem to use too many CGI-effects.

","I wasn't expecting much from this film because many of the reviews I'd read at the time of its release argued that it, and the book it was based on, were retrograde. The US soldiers provide the heroes and the North Vietnamese the villains. But it wasn't nearly so simple as that.<br/><br/>Obviously it's been heavily influenced by ""Saving Private Ryan"", at least in one respect. It's even gorier than SPR. If a phosphorous grenade explodes, we see the Grunt with the flaming stuff stuck to his skin and clothing, burning holes into him, and we see a buddy cutting away the burning flesh of his cheek with a knife. When a Grunt is caught in a friendly-napalm blast he really burns and afterward his charred flesh is blackened, so that when a buddy tries to take his legs and pull him towards a Medivac the flesh of both legs from the knees down peels off into his buddy's hands. And of course there is squib charge upon squib charge exploding in slow motion, an unfortunate clich√© by now.<br/><br/>One wonders just in passing how far this trend towards realistic gore can go -- and what the purpose behind the trip is. Well, it can't go much farther than it has. It seems just a short time ago that ""M*A*S*H"" had one shocking scene in it -- a wounded soldier in a hospital whose arterial blood pumped out of his body towards the surgeon. Actually it was more than thirty years ago. But our cinematic carnage has progressed by leaps and bounds. ""M*A*S*H"" was an early milestone. So was ""Bonny and Clyde,"" which introduced slow-motion death to American movies. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a shocking blood bath. Now we have ""Blackhawk Down"", with a still-living soldier whose lower half has been blown away. And now there's ""We Were Soldiers.""<br/><br/>As for WHY there has been such an increase of realism in violence, well, that's a different question whose answer can only be guessed at. Many cinematic movements like this one seem to follow a trajectory in which each film must out-do the previous examples of the genre. If gore is good box office, then more gore is even better box office. There may be a sincere desire on the part of the producers to show combat as it really is, but like all motives this one may be mixed, with some commercial interests thrown into the stew. And the motives of the audiences who turn these films into marketable products? It would be nice to think that they leave the theaters having learned something about the results of combat. But if that's the case, we don't seem to be showing much evidence of having grasped the lesson. In a sense, sensational gore cheapens and degrades the experience of the men and women who have lived through these extreme situations. So much suffering brings tears to the eyes, especially when we see the survivors visiting graves and monuments after the battle, as we do both here and in ""Saving Private Ryan."" And then, having wept, the audience leaves the theater and embraces the next war. The arousal jag is over. Good intentions, when viewed from a slightly different angle, have an uncanny way of resembling exploitation.<br/><br/>Okay. Enough philosophy. The movie is better than I'd expected it to be, the excess of gore and the slow-motion clich√©s aside. (I was also confused by the topography, although locations are clearly labelled. Where exactly is the creek bed?) There isn't much in the way of home-front scenes, but what there is neatly reflects the anxiety and pain of those left behind. The combat scenes are exhausting. A few hundred Americans opposed by some four thousand regulars of the North Vietnamese army. (About the same ratio of Americans to adversaries as General Custer faced, only he had no air support. Custer is brought up several times.) <br/><br/>But, most important, this is the first film I can remember seeing about the Vietnam war in which the enemy is presented as something other than outright evil. There is a good deal of irony in the movie. Mel Gibson prays before the battle. Take us under your wing, and so forth, he asks. Then throws in, ""Ignore those pagans praying to a different God."" Much later in the film, long enough for us to have forgotten Gibson's racist plea, the commander of the North Vietnamese army is also seen praying -- presumably to the same God. And one of the NV soldiers is humanized to the extent of keeping on his person a diary written to his wife. (The soldier wears glasses so we can tell him from the other North Vietnamese and remember him.) He dies heroically and when the Americans take the diary from his body and flip through it, they find a picture of his wife, a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Gibson's wife, played by Madeleine Stowe. We win the battle (Ia Drang) of course, but even this is undercut by irony. The NV commander looks at the piles of bodies after the Americans leave. He shakes his head and says, ""What a tragedy."" The worst part of it, he muses, is that the Americans will treat this as a victory and the war will go on to its necessary end, although now it will mean just that many more deaths.<br/><br/>Should you bother watching this? I think so. This one would have been a true original if it had appeared twenty years ago."

","There are many war movies, but finally there is a decent one about the Vietnam war in stead of World War II.<br/><br/>We were soldiers is a movie about the first American attack on the Vietnamese.

It also tells the story from the wife of the col., who receives the telegrams of the dead soldiers.<br/><br/>There are moments of action which are needed in a war movie. The action-moments are good and the special effects look real. There are also moments of drama, so the movie does not have full action only, which is good to stay concentrated. But the drama does not hurt the movie, because there's not to many of it.<br/><br/>Overall it's a movie which keeps your focus to the last minute.

"AntiSpielbergForce","1","98","200","7 February 2007"," The worst war movie of all time
","I don't know where to begin my defilement of this work, because it's really rotten to the core. One word best sums it up, and that is CONTRIVED. Every single scene is fabricated to be sentimental propaganda in step with current trends and political correctness. Even Spielberg couldn't reach these heights of not-so-subliminal American gung-ho, all supported by a vulgar soundtrack that tells you exactly what to feel and when to feel it.<br/><br/>Also, I hear this movie is based on a book. I can't for my life believe that the book is as boastful and self-indulgent as this nonsense. Mel Gibson's character is nothing short of Jesus himself - he's a wonderful father and husband, and a god-fearing Christian who only fights to keep his Family safe from the Twin Evils of Communism (which indeed is a pestilence, but that's beyond the obvious) and Heathendom. On the battlefield, he'll know no fear, will always be the first in line for a bullet, and will gladly sacrifice himself for his imperial comrades. And on and on. Every other soldier is also a family man and Protector of Democracy, Baseball, and Jockstraps. Well, all except Sam Elliott's character, who is supposed to be a Tom Highway/Sergeant Hartman clone, only humourless.<br/><br/>Let's just list some of the most deplorable scenes:<br/><br/>Gibson praying in church with a fellow officer, telling him that God is on their side. Gibson praying with his children, and cuddling with his wife. Gibson explaining to his daughter what a war is, and how they are the good guys (In God We Trust). Gibson's speech about brotherhood in his unit, and how he will sacrifice himself (this scene is really too laughable for words, it has to be seen to be believed). Gibson, after the war, saying that his only regret is that some of the men under his command died, and he did not.<br/><br/>The soldiers' wives are generously portrayed. They are in the movie for the sole purpose of receiving notes whenever their husbands have died. Again, to show that they have sacrificed themselves for their families. A tear spent is a dollar earned.<br/><br/>The scene when Gibson returns from the war, and his wife only sees a cab stopping outside, fearing it is a death note for her. Pathetically predictable and melodramatic.<br/><br/>And then we have the ""laundromat"" scene, which has probably the most forced PC dialogue I've ever seen. Are we supposed to believe that an American woman in the '60s (and I believe in the South?) had not heard the term ""Whites only"" before?<br/><br/>As for the war scenes, have you ever noticed how German and Vietnamese soldiers always die instantly, but American soldiers always live on for 30 another seconds? Just enough for a violin piece, his comrades holding his hands as the lights in his eyes flicker and go out, and of course, a glorious parting line.<br/><br/>And the death scenes here are truly fabricated beyond ridicule. Everyone accepts death with a smile, and no fear whatsoever. One dying soldier says ""I feel privileged to die for my country"", TWO say ""Tell my wife I love her"", one is dramatically shot dead just as he heroically lifts his wounded comrade onto a helicopter, and yet another has his newborn's name flaunting about - just so we are reminded that he's one of the good guys, and that we should be extra sad when he dies, because he ""died to protect them"" (another unwritten rule of Hollywood war movies is that whenever someone shows a picture, letter, or something to that effect, of a loved one - he will die).<br/><br/>And propaganda aside, even strictly as a war movie, it falls flat. The movie knows full well that it is dishonest and preys on sentimentality, that is has no plot to speak of, that is has only the most rudimentary strategical and tactical elaborations, and that it is completely devoid of characterization (let alone character development!). So it goes for the graphic and macabre instead - faces burning with napalm, etc. This is what can be expected, because the movie was obviously made for the very easily impressed, the drooling mass that WANTS to be told what to feel and think, because it's easier than doing it themselves.<br/><br/>Pathetic."
"Theo Robertson","4","64","128","28 September 2003"," BRAVEHEART Meets THE GREEN BERETS
","Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART ? It starred Mel Gibson who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace . The film contains over 200 errors . Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS ? That`s the John Wayne western where the Duke saves a homestead called Vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . If you watch WE WERE SOLDIERS you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .<br/><br/>First of all what`s with that Scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? I mean what`s the connection between Scotland and `Nam ? Maybe Wallace is using it in the vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - Undeservedly I might add - with several Oscars then so might this film ? Whatever reason it`s included it really jars . Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like "" They`ll never take our freedom - The hell they will "" and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and Moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movie<br/><br/>When not reminding the audience of other movies WWS also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not Asia . Hal Moore might have brushed up on the French experience in Indo-China but if that`s the case then he was unique because the American military went out of their way not to read up on the French Indo-China war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict Westmoreland replied  he had nothing to learn from the French "" Who haven`t won a war since the days of Napoleon "" so I was confused as to the portrayal of the NVA in this movie , when in 1965 the American high command , brimming with hubris held the North Vietnamese and VC in contempt . It`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of Vietnam are superlative warriors . They are , but very few Americans believed this in the mid 1960s<br/><br/>There`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? No bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the La Drang valley . Likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the Americans out number the NVA ? I put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of Wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . Take the scene where the American burned to a crisp is flown away screaming "" Tell my wife I love her "" . This should have an emotional impact similar to THAT death scene in PLATOON but here there`s no impact . In fact I found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words "" Tell my wife ... "" while mutilated or dying , I counted at least two other characters use the phrase . Did characters actually say this at the battle ? I`ve no idea but since Randall Wallace wrote the script I do have reservations<br/><br/>I sat in shocked awe watching APOCALYPSE NOW , PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water , I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET , I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER , and after seeing WE WERE SOLDIERS I felt totally patronised"
"Kumar-6","1","52","102","25 June 2002"," This is a horrible film
","We Were Soldiers drags out every cliche' in the book. Randall Wallace, the cinematic genius who wrote Pearl Harbor Braveheart and directed Leonardo DiCaprio as two characters in The Man in the Iron Mask, brings us his masterpiece. This is worse than Pearl Harbor even. Bad acting, the combat scenes were really not all that well done compared to both Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. The movie tries to be different by showing the soldiers at home before they leave for combat. Woo hoo, and for character development, we see that they have kids, cute kids who ask them questions about war. When Mel's daughter asks him what war is, he explains ""sometimes bad guys do bad things and America has to stop them."" Yes, I know that is not verbaitim, but it exemplifies the film's simplistic attitude. I was waiting for Mel to pick up an American flag and kill the general with it, Patriot style. Speaking of which, this film makes the Patriot look like the most subtle film ever made about warfare. Another thing that Wallace pretends to do is show both sides of the war by cutting in a couple scenes of the Vietnamese and showing that one of their killed soldiers has a girlfriend! Whaoh, that is groundbreaking cinema! Wallace shows his real attitude about showing both sides in a scene with Gibson and Chris Klein in a church. They kneel and pray, and Gibson prays for both sides. But at the end he throws in ""and god, what I said about both sides...disregard that, help us kick their asses."" Or something like that. I mean, what the hell? This is a movie that claims to honor the memory of the men who died in Vietnam. How exactly does it do that? By showing them get ripped apart and shot, but not by making them into flesh and blood human beings. one guy actually dies saying ""at least I died for my country."" How so? This is Nam, you died in a war we lost and that we should never have been involved in. And at least twice, a dying character tells a fellow soldier ""tell my wife...I loved her."" More ludicrous still is the scene when the photographer picks up a gun. Oh wait, it gets more ludicrous when he starts taking pictures...one of the cheesiest montages ever is supposed to display the devestation of the battle. This is a cliched, lame, poorly written and directed film that wants you to believe it is important."

","It's amazing how Randall Wallace just can't avoid creating a scene, in a script or behind the camera, without some element of cheese in it. This movie is no exception. Like his last directing effort, Man in the Iron Mask, We Were Soldiers pretends the audience are morons and riddles the entire movie with cliches and horribly concieved cheesy drama that puts even the most ridiculously contrived real-life-event TV movies to shame.<br/><br/>
Yes, this movie is different from previous Vietnam war movies. The American soldiers aren't portrayed as violent grunts with no regard for life. They aren't protrayed as men who are scarred for life from the violence, the death, and the trauma of the war. This movie is really all about Mel Gibson and his ability to spout comically bad dialogue while maintaining a straight face and of course, the innocence of America... sort of like that last disaster he wrote, Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Could this movie have done better? I thought so. If Wallace would put his ego aside, and tone down the overabundant melodramatic scenes, Soliders could've scored big for me. Too bad that's all wishful thinking.

None of the characters we feel empathy or pity for (thanks to some horrible dialogue and poor acting) and their utter reliance on the fact they are supposed to be based on real characters makes it look cheap.

"hall895","8","12","19","29 August 2005"," Into the heart of a movie battle like no other
","It is hard to stand out and be a unique war film. They've been making war films pretty much since the invention of film it seems. So you would think by now that it's all been done before, and for the most part it has. Yet We Were Soldiers manages to separate itself from the pack and give us a unique take on one particular battle in one particular war. Depicted here is the first major battle involving American troops in the Vietnam War. The fact that this battle takes place in what is known as the Valley of Death tells you all you need to know about what awaits the men who head into combat.<br/><br/>The central figure in the movie is Lt. Col Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson. Moore, leading the 7th Cavalry, will train his men and lead them into whatever hell awaits them. The film begins back home as Moore assembles his new unit and begins to whip them into shape. Here we learn much about what makes Hal Moore tick and begin to see him for the true leader of men he is. These opening scenes are important as they show many of Moore's motivations and also the obstacles which are placed in his way. The time back home also allows us to see Moore the family man with his strong, stoic wife, played by Madeline Stowe, and their young children. We also meet other key characters. There is Moore's second-in-command, battle-tested Sgt. Maj. Plumley, played with wonderful gruffness and all the appropriate seriousness by Sam Elliott. There is helicopter pilot Bruce Crandall, played by Greg Kinnear, and young Lt. Jack Geoghegan, played, surprisingly well for someone who came to prominence in a silly farce like American Pie, by Chris Klein. But the key figure throughout is undeniably Moore and Gibson's strong, confident portrayal is a key to the movie's success.<br/><br/>While important in establishing the key characters and the emotional ties that bind them to each other and those whom they are leaving behind, the opening scenes back home have a feeling of just biding time about them. The film really takes off when the 7th Cavalry is dropped into the Valley of Death and confronts the overwhelming enemy force which awaits them. The rest of the film deals with this one epic, unrelenting battle. It sounds clich√©d but the battle scenes are so well choreographed and photographed that you do truly feel as if you are there. The intensity of the conflict jumps off the screen. The focus is on the valor and heroism of the American soldiers but unlike so many war films which present a nameless, faceless enemy we also get to see things from the Vietnamese perspective. We see the enemy leaders detailing their strategy and also are presented with reminders that the Americans are not the only ones with loving, concerned families back home. We see the toll on both sides, not just for the soldiers but perhaps most poignantly in scenes inter-cut from home where soldiers' wives wait to learn the fates of the men they love.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers is a brutally honest, unflinching look at the hell that is war. It is a story which begged to be told. Seeing as it is adapted from a book by two of the central figures in the conflict, Hal Moore and reporter Joe Galloway who found himself thrust into the middle of the conflict (and who is played wonderfully by Barry Pepper in the film) you can rest assured that unlike so many other war films this one would focus on ""getting it right."" The film tells it as it truly was. It is at times invigorating and inspiring and at other times truly heartbreaking. All in all it is a fitting tribute to, as the film states at the beginning, the men on both sides who died in that place."
"TOMASBBloodhound","8","12","19","7 June 2003"," Finally, somebody got it right about Vietnam!
","Over the years, the movie going public has been subjected to film after film after film about the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, most of them are largely philosophical and don't paint the American soldier in a very positive light. The film makers usually take a leftist position towards the government and try to use the conflict on the ground as some sort of metaphor for the existential purpose of life. Thus, we get subjected to films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Casualties of War. Although those film makers are certainly free to show us these interpretations of Vietnam, it gets old seeing our military trashed and our brave soldiers painted as drugged up sadists who were fighting for an immoral cause.<br/><br/>From the beginning, you could tell We Were Soldiers is something different. It clearly shows the American soldier as what he/she usually is: Professional, brave, intelligent, and resourceful. There are no higher moral questions draped over this film. We simply see war as what it truly is. It is a conflict built up in the minds of our governments and carried out on the battlefield by our soldiers. Nothing more. Nothing less. Ultimately it is just about the man next to you and the men you're fighting against. We Were Soldiers focuses on this and this alone. <br/><br/>The Ia Drang battle scenes (which take up most of the screen time) are ferocious. Mel Gibson shines as Col. Moore. He is the ultimate personification of masculinity. He ignores repeated requests for him to leave the battlefield as his troops are cut off and outnumbered. He seems to take the loss of each man personally as each commander should do. The combat footage is very graphic. This is not a film for those with weak stomachs.<br/><br/>
This film also gives us another thing other Vietnam War films are reluctant to even touch. It shows us behind the scenes footage of the North Vietnamese Army planning their assaults and evaluating American tactics. It's about time some movie showed the human side to the NVA. They are usually portrayed as heartless, soul-less savages. This is ridiculous. They were family men who took just as much pride in a job well done as our own troops.<br/><br/>
We Were Soldiers is an experience you won't soon forget. It is the pinnacle of what a war film should be. Not much time wasted on politics or existential philosophy. It is simply a graphic a realistic portrayal of war. For the soldiers on the battlefield, it isn't a matter of politics or a question of should we be here or not. What it comes down to is this: you have to kill your enemy or he will kill you!<br/><br/>4 1/2 of 5 stars<br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound."
"alexkolokotronis","1","70","143","14 June 2008"," Religious and Right Wing Propaganda
","So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among other calling them ""leftist propaganda film."" Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. To me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.<br/><br/>The acting and writing was a little to clich√©d for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner Randall Wallace for yet another one. Throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical ""Just tell my family I love them"" or ""Tell Ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed"" lines. The was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene were Gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this ""no colors"" applies to what to put in the washing machine. Its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. Another scene is were Gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.<br/><br/>The directing displayed this all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won their. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the American flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. I love America but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.<br/><br/>This may seem like a rant and maybe it is but I cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if your not Christian your wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill I don't think so. To me this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with the countless clich√©s and overacted scenes but then when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. I guess though it is my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.<br/><br/>If you want a real depiction of the Vietnam war watch Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket which I absolutely hated was a better depiction. I have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong. A real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things."
"JohnLennon1985","10","14","23","17 September 2002"," We Were Excellent.
","From the trailers, this looked like just another war movie starring Mel Gibson. At first glance, I thought it was just a generic war flick. How wrong I was. <br/><br/>I'm glad I'm not one of those people who shuns movies just because of lack of interest. That is how I got to loving movies like the Matrix and Desperado. This movie caught my eye, because Mel Gibson is great in everything he's in, but again, this looked like another war movie that wasn't as deep as its older brothers. <br/><br/>We Were Soldiers separates itself from Mel's other War flicks. While Braveheart and the Patriot focus on one soldier and his life (along with several battle scenes), We Were Soldiers focuses on the lives of many soldiers, their families, even one of the Viet Cong soldiers, as their lives are affected in a deadly battle.<br/><br/>This film takes place in the Vietnam War, the only war we ever officially lost. The first half hour revolves around training the troops... basically, the exposition. Soon after, they fall into battle. This battle makes up most of the movie. This isn't necessarily bad. For people who like seeing blood and guts, you will love this movie. Those who want to see some story, you will also love this movie. In fact, the acting was done so well in We Were Soldiers, that I nearly burst into tears in the end in sympathy for a Viet Cong soldier. <br/><br/>That's another reason why this movie is so great. While some movies portray the ""other side"" to be barbaric and want to spill our guts, We Were Soldiers actually gives the Viet Cong soldiers feelings. Even the leader, who was shouting out orders to kill us all... Our leader was doing the exact same thing. However, we only see the Viet Cong leader being barbaric because they are the ""antagonists"". That, I highly disagree with. <br/><br/>If you should see this movie, keep in mind that the antagonists are NOT the Viet Cong, but the war itself.

Both said the movie was around 85% to 90% accurate.  FACT, one has the dubious distinction of being shot down three times in one day. The author, played by Barry Pepper, lives in South Texas not far from us and writes without fantasy. The movie is a great portrayal of the events which took place and the fighting which occurred. Our soldiers got killed and we had our outstanding leaders in the field; the enemy soldiers got killed and they had their leaders there too. Mel Gibson did not portray a ""John Wayne"" ""Green Beret"" if you want to watch a laughable war movie.  He portrayed an actual living breathing person who survived the war.

"saint_43019","Null","32","62","30 August 2004"," Clich√©d, Over-Dramatised and Very Over-Rated
","In a year that saw the second instalment of the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy open, 'Chicago' burn the screens with raw carnal energy (i.e. Catherine Zeta Jones' breasts) and fanboys of the world unite with the arrival of the holy trinity that was 'Spiderman', 'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones' and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets', it's fair to say that any cinematic endeavour that planned to face off against this line up would have to make a stellar impression.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 'We Were Soldiers' fails to live up to such standards. Given the calibre of talent (Gibson, Stowe, Kinnear, Elliot) on display here, we would have expected something with more resonance than the final product offers.<br/><br/>The picture, though having some good points to fall back on, does little more than to offer a very clich√©d story with moments that make you slap your head rather than tug your heartstrings. One moment when, the night before he heads off to battle, Moore is praying with his children and his youngest asks him `Daddy, what's war?' is enough to make you poke your eye out on principle. The visceral equivalent of dipping you in honey before throwing you to the ants.<br/><br/>The direction offered is not well suited to the material at hand. Instead of showing a level of restraint offered by other war movies, Wallace chooses to shove your face into every gory detail. It even stretches so far as to showing each one of the soldier's wives as they find out that their husband is coming back in a box. Whilst war movies have always had a tendency to offer the message that war is hell, there is always a sneaking suspicion that maybe some people had their fingers crossed when they said it with this.<br/><br/>The main selling point for this movie seemed to be that it would show the conflict from both sides. Upon watching the film and seeing the single reference to a Vietnamese soldier writing to his wife, it looks as though this angle was added more as an afterthought when someone decided that they couldn't see the screen for all the Stars and Stripes that were in the way.<br/><br/>Ironically enough, the most interesting character of the movie was not a soldier at all, but a photographer played by Barry Pepper. Instead, little attention is given to him and the focus is pointed towards the soldiers, to show the camaraderie between the men fighting and their wives back home. By leaving Pepper as part of the background noise, you find yourself so swamped by the gung-ho fighting spirit before you've even seen the battlefield, that as soon as the shooting starts, the audience wants to turn away out of boredom, rather than horror.<br/><br/>This picture marks the first effort for Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson since their incredibly well received 1995 offering, 'Braveheart'. So keen were they to recapture the past glory, they even brought back several members of the team that made 'Braveheart' what it was. Though comparisons between these two films are not really fair, with the kind of success that the first expedition yielded, it's hard not to wonder if the bar was set a little too high to for this film to jump."
"carpet_seller","1","32","62","3 April 2002"," very bad film
","I am not one for writing reviews, But I do when a film is particularly bad or good imho.<br/><br/>This one was particularly bad, it is a ""gung ho"" ""america rules the world"" ""america saves the world"" type of film.  It does not address the true causes of the Vietnam war: The western world ignoring president Diem's brutal facshist dictatorship and most importantly the US support of the dictator. Leading to the South Viet Cong formation and fight for freedom against a brutal government. The US supplying forces to help the Dictator, Diem. Then the Coup of 1963, leading to the assassination of Diem.  By now the US government run by Kennedy began to sit up and take notice, Kennedy knew these people were oppressed and as a result of the coup he was going to pull all his troops out of Vietnam and let them get on with it.  But the US generals who wanted a war decided then to assassinate Kennedy on the day before Kennedy's announcement to the nation that he was going to withdraw from Vietnam.  He was replaced by Johnson who declared to the nation the exact opposite that he would be sending more troops to South Vietnam.<br/><br/>It was as usual the USA who caused this war, the vietnamese were fighting for freedom in their own country.  So when I hear lines in this film like ""Lord forgive our enemies heathen prayers and let us blow them all to hell"" and ""the spread of communism must be wiped out""  I just get annoyed that people watching this film are not being told the truth about why this all happened in the first place.  And just exactly what is wrong with being Buddhist?<br/><br/>Also on top of that the film is NOT entertaining (because it is a graphic/explicit film about a brutal battle).  It is NOT educational (because it based on a lie and deception).  It serves very little purpose (it does touch on the futility of war but not enough) It is very badly scripted, with some really corny lines.  It is very boring for a lot of the time.  The ""stepford wives"" of the soldiers are also so pathetic.<br/><br/>This film is definately ""walk out"" material, but I don't walk out of films cos I want to see the whole tragic thing so I can offer other people my views on it.  If you go to see this one and you feel like walking out, trust me you will not miss anything important you will only miss more of the same.<br/><br/>1/10"

","This movie truly is a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes or so are awful and riddled with dreadful dialogue. When the movie finally shifts to the battle, it really doesn't click either. The characters are all cardboard and clich√©d. Pardon the pun, but you can start picking off the guys who are going to die in battle minutes after we are introduced to them.<br/><br/>Who knew that the John Wayne-esquire protagonist would make a comeback? There he is, Mel Gibson, standing tall, ignoring bullets whizzing by, nonchalantly knocking off enemy soldiers as if they were mere nuisances.<br/><br/>And there's even a ridiculous deus ex machina moment in this film that is laughable.<br/><br/>The women in this movie are mere decorations and even in those scenes, you can predict what's going to happen. And Madeleine Stowe had to pick this film not to shed her clothes, which would have been a small bonus.<br/><br/>I realize the need to make a film that honors those who fought and died valiantly in this battle. But this film is not the one to do that. I don't mind that the film never questions why we were in Vietnam or whether we should have been there.<br/><br/>This film - like ""Black Hawk Down"" - wants to simply tell the story of the battle and those who participated in it. But surely not every soldier who fought was a clich√© from almost every war picture that was ever made. The only character missing was that young, late teen-age soldier, nicknamed with the state he hails from, sitting in the trenches looking at the picture of his childhood sweetheart Betsy, telling his buddies that when he returns stateside, he's going to go back to the farm and raise a family with her and then...wham! - a sniper's bullet slams into his skull. And his buddies get really angry now because this time the bad guys killed Wisconsin.<br/><br/>And in case you were wondering whether Randall Wallace has gotten over his penchant for slow-motion, fear not. This movie's got plenty of those shots, too, in case the audience was just too dumb to realize the significance of the moment.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good movie about the early days of Vietnam, rent ""Go Tell the Spartans,"" starring Burt Lancaster."

","Randall Wallace, screenwriter of the great Braveheart, fair The Man In the Iron Mask and the horrible Pearl Harbor makes his directorial debut (I think) in this Vietnam war film that takes a different approach to the Vietnam war film- showing the first real battle over there back in late 1965.  Mel Gibson, who once directed and starred in Wallace's Braveheart, stars as Col. Moore, who is chosen to lead the 1st and 7th Cavalry divison of the army into the ""Valley of Death"" in Vietnam danger zone.  Other supporting characters include Greg Kinnear as a smart and efficient pilot with a knickname which would be censored here, Chris Klein who is always with a clean shave and little if no dirt during the battle scenes and honestly looks too womanly to be in such a army, and Barry Pepper as a war journalist dropped during the battle and witnesses first hand the horror that ensues.<br/><br/>There are too many cliches to be considered totally realistic and in the early scenes, while interesting and even amusing, make Gibson seem a little softer than he should appear.  Yet, for those in the mood for a different war picture that eerily tries to balance 40's and 50's like corniness with graphic war violence and gives a good story in the mix won't be dissapointed.

","Many good films have been made about the American/Vietnamese conflict from the sensationalistic and unpretentious ""Apocalypse Now"" to many serious minded documentaries about the harsh reality of the war. ""We Were Soldiers"" is not one of them. A pretentious retelling of the first major American engagement with the Vietnamese on the battlefield (circa 1965), the film is one contrived, obvious, and fabricated scene after another from crying because you lived and your men  didn't (a success for a field commander) to coming home unannounced (yeah, right) to a feeble attempt to honor the Vietnamese warriors, etc. etc. etc. This flick is blatant commercialism under the guise of patriotism and a poor tribute to the fighting men and women who sacrificed during the Vietnam conflict. The only thing sadder than the mentality behind ""We Were Soldiers"" is the mentality that supported it at the box office and in critical reviews. (C-)"
"full_meddle_jacket","1","18","33","16 March 2002"," A Rip-off For War Veterans
","When describing his hopes for the film ""Full Metal Jacket,"" (based on his war novel ""The Short-Timers""), author and Vietnam War veteran Gustav Hasford said, ""I didn't want to make another film that veterans are just going to go see and go, 'Oh wow, we've been ripped off again.'"" That description fits ""We Were Soldiers"" to a T. The film has no flexibility, or even a purpose to it. One long cliche full of time killing action and glory speeches. Mel Gibson's cheezy accent will make you chuckle, though. This film takes an utterly true story and cliches the life out of it. A script compiled of every worn out battle trick ever. ""We Were Soldiers"" almost unintentionally brings disrespect to war veterans. You can definitely afford to miss this screen garbage."
"gibbo-5","1","22","42","3 March 2002"," A massacre
","This movie fails in most areas and is an obvious ploy to cash-in on the patriotism fad. The makers should have spent more time editing the film to at least make it passable as a war/action movie, instead of rushing to release this piece of trash. Nevertheless, the writing was so poor that it never really had a chance to become a memorable work.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this film is that none of the characters are worth caring about. The quick jumps from scene to scene and the cliche-ridden dialog preclude the viewer from ever getting a deeper look into the hearts and minds of the players. Mel Gibson's Hal Moore was portrayed as a mythic warrior who somehow had the omniscience to predict all of the NVA's moves, and yet his notes on the French massacre looked like they were written by a ten year old. Furthermore, his religious drivel was really overdone.<br/><br/>And just because a soldier is wearing a bracelet emblazoned with his newborn's name, that doesn't mean I'm going to care if he lives or dies in battle. It's sad when a wafer-thin flick like American Pie gives Chris Klein's character more depth than a supposedly ""serious"" film like We Were Soldiers.<br/><br/>Additionally, the soldiers' wives were given a fair amount of screen time but little to do other than receive telegrams and cry. Madeleine Stowe was decent as Moore's wife (but incidentally, her collagen-injected lips were a bit distracting). And one particularly offensive scene involved these women - the scene in which they were discussing the laundromat. I thought it was in poor taste to make a joke out of racial discrimination.<br/><br/>Another incredibly offensive thing about the movie was the half-hearted attempt to present the Vietnamese as human beings. As someone else wrote here, it was very patronizing. The NVA soldiers facelessly marched up and down hills and were subsequently mowed down by gunfire like Bruce Lee disposed of hordes of ninjas. And yet the director wants us to care when the wife of a fallen soldier looks at his photo. Which is it?<br/><br/>In terms of action, the battle scenes were average. The blood and gore was on par with recent war movies. But the Americans were painted as kids who were afraid to advance unless copious amounts of bombs were dropped on the Vietnamese first. Perhaps that's how it was, but if you're going to try to tap into nationalistic fervor by picking one battle that the US won and by exaggerating the deeds of a Lt. Colonel, you may as well go all the way and invent some compelling and dramatic events on the field of battle. I might have enjoyed this film on a superficial level if there were at least some in-depth tactical maneuvers involved. Greg Kinnear flying in to the save the day isn't good enough.<br/><br/>Ultimately, We Were Soldiers is a weak war movie. It has no heart, no drama, and little action. I strongly suggest that you skip this one, as it doesn't come close to comparing to great films like Apocalypse Now and to a lesser extent, Platoon."
"mstomaso","9","11","19","24 December 2006"," Lives up to its reputation
","We Were Soldiers is one of the better war films I have seen. This says a lot, since there have been many memorable films in this genre recently. The production team managed to unify around its central objective and more or less perfectly execute what they had intended - to bring a particular battle to the screen in as realistic a manner as possible. The film is told from the point of view of those who wrote the book upon which it is based - definitely from an American perspective - but more importantly from the perspective of a soldier. Soldiers in this film are depicted as duty and honor bound people trying to do a job, follow through with a commitment, and to keep themselves and each other alive.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the first major offensive of what would later become known as the Viet Nam war. The action takes place in the Ia Drang (later referred to as The Valley of Death), and is brutal and relentless. Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper lead a fine ensemble cast - nobody slips up whatsoever. The stars - and there are many recognizable faces here - disappear into their characters such that you will forget who they are. Clearly, all of the participants in this film believed whole-heartedly in what they were doing.<br/><br/>Unlike many films of this genre, We Were Soldiers does not obsess upon heroism, on political commentary and/or on right or wrong. Since these issues are largely irrelevant in the 'on the ground' situation of the soldier at war, the perspective is appropriate and refreshing. The film borders on grotesque with its frequent and graphic violence. But its subject is one that should never be soft-pedaled. War is violent, grotesque and excessive by its very nature. Anything short of disgust would have sold the subject short.<br/><br/>An important point, however, is that condemning war is in no way a condemnation of the brave persons who participate in it. Participation in war sacrifices not just time, energy, and at least a part of one's life, but also a piece of an individual's humanity. Regardless of the politics and all of the rest of the armchair ""participation"" many of us may indulge in, what touched me most about this film was knowing that itaccomplished its one simple and important goal - to truthfully tell the story of those who lived and died in Ia Drang without a lot of embellishment, romance, or panache. What a great and honorable purpose."
"spatenbier","10","11","19","27 February 2004"," 75% real, 25% Hollywood but outstanding for being realistic!
","As far as I am aware, this film is the first and only film to make any attempt whatsoever to reflect what fighting in Vietnam was like, and how we fought.  Great attention to detail and adherance to what generally happened, with input from the very people who were there and wrote the book upon which served as the basis for the movie paid off.  There was none of the standard Hollywood venom that characterizes the vast majority of Hollywood films set in Vietnam.  There were some things that were pretty ridiculous, like an NVA soldier walking up to Mel Gibson without firing his weapon, like a dieing soldier saying something like he was glad to give his life for his country, like the setting looking little like Vietnam.  But overall, the film was right on target.  I served in this unit later in the war and was really shaken by the film.  It was too close to reality that I had long ago buried. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get an idea of how soldiers really fought."
"iannicholls","Null","11","19","12 January 2004"," A Salute To Heroes.
","Not too many movies are made about the time America grew up and lost its soul, so when I saw how much flak this movie was catching, I HAD to find out why. The true story of Ia Drang is more harrowing than even this movie managed to depict, and those watching this and belittling it, and the actions of a few hundred men in fighting a battle few people knew or cared about until recently is the proof that America's Innocence died in 1965.<br/><br/>Personal thoughts on the Viet Nam war notwithstanding, this IS the era that America turned from care-free and innocent to cynical and selfish. The decade that started with Kennedy and the Camelot Administration and ended with Watergate, Kent State, the Chicago Convention, and Altamont were the years that Americans should mourn more than any in their history. We went from ""Can-Do"" to ""Screw You"", and this was the main reason.<br/><br/>While most people alive today weren't even born at the time the events in this movie took place, their prejudices and mind-sets are those instilled by the last ""innocent"" generation (their parents usually) ..... and those who howl most and roll their eyes at ""yet ANOTHER Viet Nam movie"" would also do well to remember that what they are really peeved about is not that another movie has been made about a war, but that a movie has been made that points out just what was lost to America and the world during this conflict.<br/><br/>Until the events depicted here took place, Viet Nam was just another place where America was deploying troops. The days surrounding these events and the subsequent distress-call of ""Broken Arrow"" brought home to the America and the world just how real the conflict was and how savage savage it would become.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I was actually prepared to hate this movie just on account of who was in it and how much I disliked their more recent disastrous forays into the big-screen.<br/><br/>Looking at the cast list, I was half-expecting this to be another garbage, high-budget movie whose cast was only there for their box-office appeal (Titanic, Braveheart, Signs, Vanilla Sky, etc.) and this was one of the reasons I resisted watching it.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the choices for the main players - Sam Elliot as a tough old Sergeant-Major was quite a treat, and Mel Gibson has always been better in action-flicks. Seeing actors one usually doesn't associate with action/war movies  wearing uniforms is something of a shock, and at first I thought that they would appear out of their depth, but Greg Kinnear gave a good performance as Major Crandall - I've always thought helicopter-pilots were a little unzipped anyway, and I found his performance to be the most believable of all.<br/><br/>There were moments that the movie didn't really need, and the syrup was laid on a little thick at the beginning, but all that aside, I enjoyed this flick."
"KSoze00","1","26","53","4 March 2002"," One of the worst movies of the year
","That is a lofty title, and I plan on backing it up point by point.<br/><br/>1:  The performances were weak at best:  Mel Gibson was decidedly wooden as he portrayed Lt. Col. Moore.  I understand that this role is hard to play, the character itself is rife with cliches, but a performance based exclusively on cliches is below Gibson (I blame the writer/direcotr, more on that later.)  Madeline Stowe was terrible.  Did she receive a copy of this script before the day they shot it?  She flubbed lines, made unnatural facial movements (these really got me,) and all and all stunk up the joint. You know when Felicity is acting circles around you something is terribly wrong.  As for the younger actors, Barry Pepper was good as a journalist, and Marc Blucas was fine, but he and Chris Kline ended up being inconsequential.  Also, the Amy Tan inspired all-women sit ins were dreadfully acted.<br/><br/>2:  The script was a series of unnecessary monologues:  Mel Gibson's character is ridiculously saintly.  He gives a very special speech to his men, his kid, his wife, his men again, another one of his kids, his wife again, a journalist, his men again... it goes on.  It felt totally unnatural, and the unnecessary speeches took momentum away from the more interesting scenes.<br/><br/>3:  The cinematography was lazy:  Blood on the camera on half a dozen occasions.  If this was on purpose this camera man needs to be shot.  if not... well... perhaps film school is the answer.  Also, shots were oddly out of focus, mislit, and just poorly done.  Greg Toland where are you, deep focus would have been nice, hell, any focus would have been nice.<br/><br/>4:  There was no consistant tone:  The film jumped around, cut out of scenes at emotional moments, and had no consistancy at all.  The tone fo the film towards the start felt almost comic, and then suddenly it tried to be Saving private Ryan, then it flashed back to America for 15 minutes, and then didn't return.  We had battle scenes that felt out of place, and no consistant style shown at all.  This felt like a high school production in that sense.<br/><br/>5:  The music was ridiculous:  Ugh, I know the 7th batallion theme is an Irish war song, but could they have found a less legubrious version. Honestly, I was laughing every time they played it.  Plus, the cliche ridden score felt disjointed as it jumped from 1950's war music, to sweeping emotional faire.  It was just poorly done.<br/><br/>6:  The montages:  There were almost a dozen random montages that killed any momentum the movie had (often very little.)  my favorite was the Barry Pepper camera one, it really cracked me up.  It looked like something me and my friends would put together on my computer.  Layer 1, actor jumping up and down in front of a blue screen with a camera.  Layer 2, black and white photos.  Layer 3, stock footage of fire.  I AM NOT KIDDING!  THEY CUED STOCK FOOTAGE!!!  The production values were low all around, but that was pathetic.<br/><br/>7:  Blatant and unnecessary deviations from the text:  For a movie that tauted itself as based on true events, perhaps they should have stuck to true events.  Moore was not on the front lines leading his troops over a hill.  He, like any officer following protocol, was behind his troops as he led them into battle (a battle that hardly resembled the finale.)  That was just one of a number of instances where the filmmakers ignored the truth for no apparent reason, as the dramatic tension was not increased their way.<br/><br/>I think i covered most of my complaints, although I have more.  This was a poor film, and I cannot recommend it.  See Blackhawk Down, a far superior film, hell, see Rollerball, it at least doesn't pretend to be good.  This is Spike Friedman signing out.

","When Lt Col Hal Moore is drafted back in to lead a new platoon of men he didn't know that he would lead them into the first major battle of the Americans' entry into the Vietnam war. This is the story of that battle where the unit was dropped into the middle of the action, mere miles from the main base camp of the enemy and was immediately attacked by a prepared enemy who had a better knowledge of the terrain.<br/><br/>Although I have seen many Vietnam movies, I would certainly claim no understanding or knowledge of individual battles or tactics and to be honest, the main interest I have in battles of the period would focus on the military action in my own country of the time because I think it is important to know your own culture and understanding who you are. However I am interesting and will certainly always appreciate a war film that tells it like it is and isn't just a gung-ho, flag waving glorification of death. Looking at the cast list for this film though, made me think that perhaps it would be the latter and thus I didn't bother with it in the cinema. Having now seen the film for myself I must admit that I was partly wrong because the film is not all glorification but the mix of trying to do too much perhaps weakens it and does make it tend towards this at times.<br/><br/>In some ways the film succeeds because it is interesting in the way it focuses on one particular battle and does convincingly capture the horror of death during war ¬ñ it is impossible to watch this and not be moved by the sheer waste of life it shows. Indeed the director is at pains to make sure we see the impact back home, even to the detriment of the film as I understood the loss without seeing crying families. The director also seems to be making great efforts to cover all bases and present the whole picture in some regards but yet fails in others; so we have balanced views of the enemies and the dialogue is clear of ethnic insults and lingo but yet at the same time we never seem anything that would condemn the war ¬ñ hence we have no friendly fire incidents or really any deaths that are less than noble. This is a weakness of the film ¬ñ it can't help but slightly glorify or sugar coat the total product; hence the start and end lack the emotional impact of the battle scenes and although the film is about the loss of life and waste of youth, it still hits a ""noble"" and ""worthy"" note that some may feel undermines the message the rest of it seems to be putting out.<br/><br/>Even though this is my gut reaction, I know I'm being a little unfair because, when portraying real men who died younger than me, then why not give them the dignity they deserve, but it is a difficult mix to carry off and, while good, I'm not sure the film totally managed to do it. The cast have the hardest job and many of them don't do anything beyond the predictable. Gibson is all very heroic, noble and courageous and he does the job but the rest of his men are a lot less effective in pigeon-hole roles. Elliot is good but obvious as a gruff Sgt-Major, Kinnear is a heroic fly-boy, Klein is the young father and so on. The women have less material to work with and are left with the histrionics to deliver ¬ñ Stowe is the lead in a collection of good but mostly unnecessary performances. While none of them really have strong characters to work with, the majority do enough to pass muster in this film and I was pleased that Gibson was a lot more human than Braveheart suggested he would be.<br/><br/>Overall this is a solid war movie that manages to mix the horror with the nobility of war ¬ñ a difficult trick to pull off and unfortunately a mix that will niggle sections of the audience who came for flagwaving and got depressing reality and vice versa those that came for gritty horror and got too much sentimentality. The cast are better than the names involved would suggest, even if they don't have much to do and some do have ""movie soldier"" dialogue to deliver in unconvincing ways (eg ""I'm glad to...die....for...my...country"") but it is still worth seeing even if there are better Vietnam movies."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>My dad was a man like this. I saw the film in an audience filled with men and women like this. I've worked with many people like this. The smartest among them know that wars are fought over ideas, and struggle to understand those ideas as intelligent warriors.<br/><br/>One understanding is the notion that ideas take on a life of their own and act selfishly to reproduce themselves, adapting as required. One way that ideas battle each other is in films, because films invent society. And so we have the ideas behind this film and the recent `Black Hawk Down,' battling for a subliminal control over how we think of war.<br/><br/>And it is a battle royale. Both films use a state of the art visual vocabulary, much advanced since even `Pvt Ryan.' And both films depict an air cavalry mission gone wrong resulting in a stranded, outnumbered group of rangers. Both center the motivation of the men of looking out for the guy next them. Both emphasize the `no man left behind' principle. But `Black Hawk' is a film about situations. Situations create war and the mistakes therein. In that film, the characters are deliberately confusing and there is lots of attention given to spatial definition and position. `Black Hawk' is first a cinematic being with visual sense to which a narrative is applied.<br/><br/>`Soldiers' exists in a different world altogether. In this world, men drive events and cause wars. Their commitment (shown here as nobility) is the engine. Personalities matter, even to the point that the killed are listed in the credits. So this film spends lots of time on character development (such as it is) and interactions among (mostly between) them. `Soldiers' was born as a text, to which is here appended illustration.<br/><br/>World of difference between these two views, one could say religions. This conflict of ideas is as profound a war as any. And we are the participants, and some of us combatants.<br/><br/>You define yourself in large part. And a large part of that is in deciding what you think is funny, another area where movies battle for your soul. That's tough, but at least you can engineer how you approach war movies, and which ones you reach out to.<br/><br/>I see that we are polarizing around the old John Wayne issue, with Mel Gibson taking that role. As for me, `The Thin Red Line' is the deepest, most visceral war movie."
"rschubring","10","9","16","29 January 2004"," The Best Scene Fell to the Cutting Room Floor
","I was shocked to view the DVD version of the film and see that the single most important event of the story had been cut from the film, but was presented to the DVD audience as an add-on.<br/><br/>The scene, a Saigon debriefing of Col. Hal Moore by a senior Johnson Administration official, amply demonstrated the chasm of willful ignorance that set official Washington into a state of gridlock.<br/><br/>The subject remains topical.  A review of today's headlines will reveal similarities in thinking. Take, for example, the following loaded question from a political fundraising letter I recently tossed in the trash: ""Should the U.S. have invaded Iraq alone or must we get U.N. permission to defend ourselves?"".  This question omits 1)did we need to invade Iraq to defend ourselves, 2)might someone who opposes war in general, oppose it regardless of whether the U.N. grants some nation a license to start a ""police action"", 3)would the invasion be justified to prevent a future attack upon us, 4)would the invasion be justified if it led to a free Iraq, without any threat against us, or 5)was the invasion justified to put one war criminal (Saddam) in custody, 12 years after his last war crime?  By my count, there are 7 sides to the question and not just 2. (Hopefully readers will think of a few more!).<br/><br/>Vietnam was terribly polarizing to our country, precisely because the war demanded we choose one side or the other, shut down our brains, and ignore every possible subtopic that might alter the terms of the debate. This film abundantly demonstrates that the war's participants did not view any part of it as a 2-sided question...but then, official Washington wasn't there to participate, and had the luxury of simplicity."

","Although still a solid war movie, it wasn't up to my expectations, although it's still a ""keeper"" in my collection. With the cast, and hype of this film at the time of its release, I excepted something more, something akin to Saving Private Ryan.....but it wasn't to be. Even though the latter is known for its graphic violence, it's this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not SPR. The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes.<br/><br/>Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an ""excellent"" film.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War. Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer. Mel Gibson's character here is a decent Catholic. Greg Kinnear is solid, too, as the helicopter pilot and Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film."

","I stumbled upon this movie one evening by accident and I am glad I did. I am puzzled as to why I didn't hear more about it at the time. Maybe the fine film Saving Private Ryan was further back in the American consciousness to make it more 'popular' but this should have been a more 'successful' movie.<br/><br/>At least with the D-Day landings one could understand the reason for the fight - what on earth were these soldiers being flown in here for? A graphically realistic series of battle scenes that maybe we have all become hardened to on screen nowadays and, lets face it, unless one has actually been there it is never going to be recreated just how it was but this was pretty close I am sure.<br/><br/>Congratulations to those involved with the film, what a waste of life it was and a good portrayal of the senselessness, the horrors and the people left at home."

","We Were Soldiers is quite possibly the greatest war movie ever.  This titles isn't given out lightly considering all the great movies that have been made (Platoon, Hamburger Hill, Saving Private Ryan).  No movie I have seen has devled so deep into the emotion of war.  It mixes the intese action scenes with the back home emotion of lost loved ones, in such away that it leaves you breathless.<br/><br/>Were Were Soldiers shows us the first battle in the Vietnam War, before the country boycotted it, before we knew we couldn't possibly win the war, back to when our professional soldiers went into the with hope and honor. Because of this we are given a totally different perspective than any other Vietnam War movie, and a perspective that you need to see.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly emotional, and incredibly accurate (see Lt. Col. Moore's comments on the special features).  This is a must see."

I remember the shoddy reception that the typical soldier got returning home from this awful war. It had become so politicized that very little appreciation was shown to them. Whether the war is just or not, soldiers that fight it bleed and die, supposedly for their country. The battle screenplay, effects and intensity are among the best I've seen.

The only other contender for that distinction is Hamburger Hill -- another that deals with a historic engagement.  <br/><br/>The theme of We Were Soldiers is best summed up by the real-life unit commander in an interview (included in the special features on the DVD).  He thoroughly hates war, but loves the brave men who lay their lives on the line for their country.  That even includes those on the opposing side; they fought valiantly as well.  And they are in the movie, too.<br/><br/>War's many horrors -- the bloodshed, the suffering of the wounded, the separation from family, and the effects on the home front are portrayed frankly and realistically.  Nothing is glorified or sugar-coated. <br/><br/>
Finally (WARNING: Spoiler!) the last part provides ominous foreshadowing of what lies ahead for the Americans in Southeast Asia.  Our leaders in Washington display a naive optimism which, as we now know, was tragically misplaced.  If they had only known!"

","I found this movie to be very good.  I had refused to see it in the theater because I figured that it would just be another bad war movie.  I was wrong.  Mel Gibson delivers a powerful performance.  I especially enjoy how his frankness, and compassion feel believable for the character he protrays.<br/><br/>Also this movie is different in how it depicts the enemy.  They aren't shown as overly inferior, or ruthless.  I don't like how many movies show the Vietnamese as a bunch of blood thirsty animals.  The enemies leader is shown as being high intelligent, and if anything overly confident.<br/><br/>
Yes, this movie is bloody, but it is impossible to depict the harsh realities of war without violence.  I think that everything is shown in a manner that does not take honor away from the soldiers."

","This is best film on the Vietnam War that I have ever seen. Mel Gibson does extremely well as a commanding officer and father of five seeing the omens stack up one by one.  With support from war movie vet Sam Elliot, they put on two of the best performances in this film.  I liked Sam Elliot's dead-on and somewhat hilarious retorts to the other cast members.  Chris Klein, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper, Madeline Stowe, and Keri Russell rounded out a great cast that were all affected by the first major skirmish of the Vietnam War. What made this movie especially good and at some points hard to watch was the method of chosen storytelling.  The story wasn't limited to the American combatants.  It told the story from the Vietnamese point of view of the North Vietnamese army as well as the wives of the American troops.  This was another film to show that war is hell for every side.  It is reminiscent of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Enemy At The Gates"".  The cinematography, choreographed violence, and make-up effects made this biopic of the 7th Cavalry Division all the more unsettling and effective.  Randall Wallace made a film that should always be looked at as one of the most patriotic films of all time.  This is the best war film to have come out since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and I give it a 10 out of 10!"

I digress, 'When we were soldiers' tells a very important story, it's amazing how history repeats itself and sad how we forget our mistakes.

It humanized all characters and you felt as though the unexpected was out to grab you. The movie took you to all kinds of perspectives, the Vietnamese, the war at home, and off course the front from the American soldiers. It was a movie which covered it all and everything you had to see was shown, the brutality, the horrors, the bonds of friends, and the loss of life. It leaves you with a really new image of the war and you actually sit there and ask yourself how could men have possibly survived with such scenes running through their minds. I would say the film is the closest thing to perfectly depicting those scenes but we all acknowledge that true images of war cannot possibly be shown on the big screen.

"burtonsquare17","10","5","8","17 March 2011"," The events that transgress in what became known as The Valley of Death were of a nature that brought chills to my very core.
","WARNING: May contain minor spoiler(s)!<br/><br/>In the film We Were Soldiers (2002), the true story of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and his battalion of 7th Cavalry troops is told in a way that truly touched my deepest emotion, especially with regard to my tenure in the military. The events that transgress in what became known as The Valley of Death were of a nature that brought chills to my very core. Alongside his men, Lt. Col. Moore (Gibson), Major Bruce ""Snake"" Crandall (Greg Kinnear), and Sergeant Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliot) lead the companies of the 7th Calvary, who stood at a mere 400 or so men, against over 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Throughout the film, a recurring theme stands most prominent, and is showcased as the foundation to Lt. Col. Moore's purpose in leading a battalion; No man gets left behind. The unbelievable bravery displayed by the men of 7th Cavalry speaks to this very idea, as their selfless service to one another, as well as their lieutenant colonel left no question in my mind; Each soldier knew the task to be completed.<br/><br/>Throughout the carnage that takes place in The Valley of Death, a story is narrated by a non-combative photographer, Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper), who ultimately takes part in the battle due to sheer necessity with regard to survival. Ultimately, Galloway turns back to his camera to ensure his experiences, and that of the soldiers of the 7th Calvary is told free of error. Such experiences Galloway seeks to capture include the honorable actions of Lt. Col. Moore's men, as well as Lt. Col. Moore himself. Lt. Col. Moore truly defines himself as an unmatched leader, as he holds true his promise made before leaving for North Vietnam; ""I will be the first one to step on the field of battle, and the last to step off.""<br/><br/>The theme present within We Were Soldiers (2002) shares similarity to another film, that of Black Hawk Down (2001). In each film, soldiers of an elite military unit showcase endless acts of heroism and bravery, sometimes leading to their ultimate fate in effort to save that of a fellow brother-in-arms. Each film also conveys a secondary theme, being that of the effects war has on those who participate. Survivor's guilt is very common among the soldiers involved in war, and such emotional reaction is seen in Major Crandall after the first day of battle in The Valley of Death. Upon returning to base camp after a full day of transporting troops in his Huey helicopter, Maj. Crandall is overwhelmed by the sight of so many wounded and dead soldiers, and is actually driven to pulling out his sidearm on a fellow soldier and pilot after a brief argument. During the previously mentioned scene, such emotion and intensity is captured perfectly by director Randall Wallace, and through use of red color tones and lighting Maj. Crandall's instability is well understood by the viewer. Wallace also takes advantage of the lighting effects created by explosions and gunfire to illuminate the poised, yet fear-filled faces of 7th Cavalry soldiers that stand guard during the night. During such scenes, Wallace creates a setting that proves very authentic, as the only constant source of light for the men in The Valley of Death is provided by moonlight, with bursts of brightness brought on by gunfire and exploding ordinance. Wallace also employs symbolism during the visual telling of this story, as seen in the Western Union Telegrams delivered to the unknowing widows of fallen soldiers. There is raw and overwhelming emotion of sadness and fear seen as it falls upon the faces of military wives when they see the yellow envelope in the hand of Julie Moore (Madeleine Stowe), wife of Lt. Col. Moore, followed by submission to the reality of what has happened. Julie Moore becomes weak and unstable at the sight of the yellow envelope, only to learn the cab driver is simply lost, which ultimately leads to her volunteering to deliver the letters of disappointment herself. The loss that is felt by these military wives is expressed almost perfectly in a single shot, that being a still frame close-up of the yellow envelope being held by a newly-widowed woman and the wedding band that rests on her finger. Ultimately, We Were Soldiers (2002) is, in my opinion, one of, if not the most well done war films of my time (my time referring to the short, 26 years I have spent in this world). Furthermore, in watching the film I have come to appreciate even more the sacrifices I made during my tenure in the military, while also feeling humbled, knowing quite well I was able to do so only because of the sacrifices made by men like those in the 7th Calvary led by Lt. Col. Moore. Even those who have not served their country can take away from this film an understanding of the sacrifices made by men in order to ensure freedoms and rights, as well as the bond that is born and which carries on even after service. In short, any person, soldier or not, that takes the time to view We Were Soldiers (2002) will understand how important, how vital it is that, ""No man be left behind."""

Hal Moore rarely left his post, but I guess Mel Gibson doesn't really give a damn, he just wants to act all dramatic.<br/><br/>There were some good things about this movie, while once again not keeping in the line with the book, the stories involving the army wives were somewhat intriguing, but since the fates of their husbands were for the large part completely ""fictional"" affairs, they fell flat for me. My suggestion is, if you want to get inside the head of a soldier, a commander, and a worried spouse at home during Vietnam, read the book ""We Were Soldiers Once and Young"", if you don't want that, and you just want to see Mel Gibson in another mindless action movie, see this film."

","It is funny how in recent years, when one is leaving the cinema after having watched yet another Hollywood war movie, one gets the impression that the US army are a bunch of heroes who are always fighting for a good cause. No true criticism of the military seems to be allowed these days.One reason is probably because the army is so forthcoming in lending equipment to filmmakers but this of course makes prostitutes out of directors and producers, who are no longer free to make a judgment and draw the right conclusions. I fully understand that the US public is hungry for patriotic material to satisfy the feelings of national pride that are so strong these days. However, this can never be a reason for not viewing one`s own shortcomings in a critical light! To me, ""The Deer Hunter"" with Robert De Niro was what I would consider a really great (anti)war movie.The final scenes where the hunter decides to NOT shoot the deer, conveys the message ""live and let live"" instead of unloading all this b******t pathos when soldiers are saluting each other in the end..(this has almost become standard in most recent war movies). Where are the REAL humans in these films? Even ""Saving Private Ryan""  - which I othervise consider of the best films ever made - was not free of these empty gestures which smell of the worst John Wayne rubbish from the far, far right side of the political spectrum...."

","You don't have to be a ""war"" movie buff to appreciate the action, suspense and grittiness of this film.  This movie shows us how much firepower, calculation and luck was involved in winning just one battle against a determined enemy in Vietnam. The audience can see that there was little room for error when dealing with the Vietnamese flank and overwhelm tactics.  The occasional scene swap back to America to deal with the first of 58,000 eventual grieving families was a nice touch.  I give it a nine.  If not for anything else, and it had ""else"", for the fact it made me proud to be an American."

","We Were Soldiers is not for the squeamish.  It ranks up there with Saving Private Ryan for realistically showing the brutality of war.  I was moved almost beyond description by the ordeal these 390-odd US Army Air Cav soldiers endured at the hands of thousands of Viet Cong troops.  It is as close to Hell as one could get on earth--a charnel house of horrors, where death is sudden and swift.  Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot lead a group of green recruits into the Valley Of Death on an impossible mission in the early days of our involvement in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Based on actual events in 1965, this was the first major involvement of US troops and North Vietnamese regulars.  The writing, directing, and acting are first rate, and the battle scenes are too real for comfort.  What really makes the mind reel is that after the slaughter depicted in this film, Mel's character Lt. Col. Hal Moore goes back to the valley of death for more than 200 days.  The American dead are listed on 3 East of the Vietnam Memorial Wall.  I stood at attention and cried when the names of the fallen were listed at the end of the film.  You will, too."

","It's hard to say what I didn't like about this movie. The acting was great. The effects were great. The dialogue was great. The tempo was non-stop. Maybe that was it ... I rented this and found I had to take a break to get my breath back! Should a movie really engage you so closely in the dirty realities of battle? Watching ET ride a bicycle across the sky is so much easier on the brain. Do I really want to watch guys getting their bodies shot apart?<br/><br/>Still, I'd highly recommend the movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. I did find Mel Gibson to be a bit of an awkward fit for Colonel Moore. His pretty boy face was a bit short of real for the gutsy role, even with all the dirt and blood smeared on it. But being the actor he is, he pulls it off. A young Scott Glenn would have been a best cast for the part.<br/><br/>What I did really like about the movie is that it did not overly glamorize or deify war. Both the Americans and the Vietnamese suffered greatly, and the movie effectively showed suffering on both sides. <br/><br/>Haven't seen this yet? Go rent it now.

","A fine and acceptable account of the first major battle in Vietnam between the N.V.A. and the U.S. forces in the Ia Drang Valley, as known as ""The Valley of Death"". The movie is well-cast with Mel Gibson, Chris Klein, and Sam Elliott who portray the high-ranking members of the seventh Air Calvary division who lead the unit of four hundred men into the area, nearly walk into a major bushwhack (or ambush), and discover their counterpart have more troops (2,000 to be exact). Plus, it shows some scenes where the wives of the soldiers (Madeline Stowe and Keri Russell among them) who were or weren't prepared to deal with the fact that their loved ones might not come back alive. That's how war is - merciless and simply unforgiving.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Randall Wallace, who in directing his second film here, has the tough task of handling the scenes, and he shows no problems in doing so. The movie has a small mix of Samuel Fuller, Sam Peckinpah, and Oliver Stone. And there's a couple of nice touches at the movie. The first one being Gibson character writing to a widow of a dead NV soldier and the second one decading this movie to those who died in the fight."
"mjanky","8","4","6","11 October 2002"," Intense and touching, with decent characters.
","My biggest complaint about the film ""Blackhawk Down"" was that the characters were never really developed, so it was hard for me to get emotional about their struggle. Just the opposite is true in ""We Were Soldiers"". Usually, the infantrymen in Viet Nam films are nameless faceless extras, but here many of the 'grunts' get a decent back-story just like the 'leaders' do to build on, and it helps when viewing the movie. When you care about the characters, it's a much more enjoyable experience even when the scenes are as brutal and graphic as they are here. Mel Gibson as the leader Hal Moore, borderlines on over-the-top, but as the film went on I began to accept it as accurate because 1) the real Hal Moore was a consultant during filming and 2) I bet over-the-top was mandatory when dealing with the many intense situations these soldiers and their families were faced with. Sam Elliot as an old crusty sargent was great and should be recognized at award time. In the middle of battle he tells all the young soldiers ""Any of you call me grandfather and I'll kill ya."" Greg Kinear is also very good as an arrogant helicopter pilot, who backs up his boasts when it counts. Good, not great performances are put in by Chris Kline and Barry Peppar. Madeline Stowe is adequate as the wife of Hal Moore who takes on the role of leader of the wives left behind. <br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier the battle scenes are extremely graphic and disturbing, but never gratuitous. Randall Wallace who had double duty as both writer and director, never glorifies the violence, whether it's Americans or the Vietnamese. The 'days-long' battle portrayed here was the first major one of the war for the U.S. and took place in 1965, so it was refreshing not too see a lot of the drug-use and anti-war rhetoric that took place as the war went on, as shown in Apocalypse Now, and Full Metal Jacket. I was born in 1962 so naturally I have no real recollection of Viet Nam, but looking at a lot of the comments from other IMDB users that were there; they have positive things to say about the movie, and that's probably the best compliment Mr. Gibson and Mr. Wallace could hope to receive. 9 of 10."

","Edge of the seat from start to finish.  Not a slow spot in it.  It made me see that war is Hell.<br/><br/>I think it blew ""Full Metal Jacket"" out of the water.  Because it didn't blow me away in just the first half.  The whole movie blew me away.<br/><br/>It's got ""Oscar"" all over it.  Mel should be up for Best Actor next year. As for Sam Elliot, as Best Supporting Actor.  And it should be up for Best Picture next year.  It's not just another ""War"" movie.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it's a great story about the first time the Air Cav went in to action.<br/><br/>What I thought was very interesting, was the way the film shows both sides of the battle.  What was going on from both perspectives.  I don't remember any other ...Nam movies doing that.  Maybe I haven't seen them all, but the ones I have, never showed what was going on in the tunnels during the battles.<br/><br/>It was a positive movie about the War.  It didn't come out with all the BS that happened during the late 60'S.  It showed how these guys fought alongside each other.  Not against each other.<br/><br/>It always seems to be the goal of every ...Nam film that comes out. Hollywood gives us pictures of American Troops against each other.  There is a little pushing and shoving between American pilots, but I got the feeling from this movie that We still thought We were going to win the War.<br/><br/>It wasn't the kind of Vietnam War movie that ends leaving you wondering, ""What the Hell was that?""  There's a real story here and not a bunch of the depressing Hollywood liberal crap that they insist on putting in all of the films about this war.  This one stands above that.<br/><br/>I felt proud about what these men did in that portion of the war.  I was too young to know what was going on back in the mid 60'S and early 70'S, but I am not unaware of what went on during those times now.  I was in a theatre that had some 25 year olds or teenagers in it.  They laughed at some points of this film and don't have a clue about history.  This war is old to them and they won't see what we do, until movies about our current campaign against terrorism comes out in the next year or so.<br/><br/>Sure it's a graphic film, but what war flick isn't?  Vaporising napalm scenes and a few bloody body parts flying through the air is just how it goes.<br/><br/>Mel's Icon Productions has another winner here.  Can't wait for the DVD!

"TheBigPulsatingBrain","8","4","6","4 April 2002"," An eye-opener...
","As I am only 23 and from England, the Vietnam War passed me by with me learning very little knowledge about the events that took place there and the huge amount of human loss that was endured. I was only just informed about the events of 'The Valley of Death' by friend in the car on the way to the cinema who happens to be interested in war history. As he was filling me in on what I needed to know, I became more convinced that I would not enjoy this film as I find war films difficult to stomach at the best of times. But I am glad I did. If the courage and valour of the American soldiers is even 10% of what was portrayed on the screen then I am truly amazed and inspired. Mel Gibson was outstanding as Col. Moore, a man who understood the futility of his orders but would prepare his men and take care of them the best he could. Chris Klein was also excellent, showing he has more acting ability in him than just what we see in American Pie. Madeleine Stowe was also perfect as the devoted wife to Col. Moore and to all the other soldiers and their wives. In terms of historical accuracy(often where cinematic re-enactments fall on their faces)I am not sure if it was correct, as I am not entirely sure as I mentioned earlier that I do not have a huge knowledge of this particular conflict, but my friend told me it was pretty accurate and also that Col. Moore was an advisor on how the combat took place during shooting but if it was then this was a brilliant piece of film making and has encouraged me to watch more films of the same genre."

"ColonelFaulkner","6","7","13","28 June 2004"," Not bad but could have been a lot better.
","I saw this film at the theatre when it came out and thought it was pretty good on the big screen.<br/><br/>I have it on DVD and have watched it a couple more times. Unfortunately my opinion of this film has lessened with two repeat screenings.<br/><br/>I'll still rate it a 6 out of 10 because the battle scenes are largely very good.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film but could have been a lot better given the subject material, the historical background and the scale of the battle. I haven't read the book about the real event.<br/><br/>I loved Sam Elliot as the Sgt Major and thought Barry Pepper was good.<br/><br/>With subsequent viewings I have paid more attention to what I think are the overbearing clich√©s, patriotism and corniness (""I'm glad I could die for my country"", ""tell my wife I love her"", ""we'll give 'em hell sir"" etc).<br/><br/>While there's nothing wrong with patriotism and I can't speak from experience, I suspect Hoot (Eric Bana)in Blackhawk Down was far more realistic about men under fire when he said ""Once that first bullet goes past your head politics goes right out the window"" and ""It's about the man next to you"". <br/><br/>Colonel Moore (Gibson) seems too perfect. An officer, gentleman, historian, wonderful father, husband, religious man and leads from the front. He would be a shoe-in for President. He seemed a bit too gung-ho under fire. All that was missing was for him to be holding an M-60 (heavy machine gun) in one hand and firing it from the hip. Did he not have any weaknesses?<br/><br/>Perhaps Gibson had too much influence over the director in regards to the character of Moore. They have worked together on Braveheart and I think Gibson's company made the movie (I may be mistaken).<br/><br/>Not an Oscar winning performance from Gibson, but it appeared to be a Medal of Honour winning performance from Moore.<br/><br/>Some other annoying bits:<br/><br/>Director Wallace seems to love killing people off in mid-sentence. If I go to war I'm going to keep my mouth shut. I'm less likely to become a casualty.<br/><br/>We are introduced to the Japanese American soldier who informs us that he is about to become a father, it's so blatant that we should endear ourselves to him a bit more just before he is horrifically (mortally?)wounded.<br/><br/>I know that they can do wonders with special effects these days but do the directors judge the success of their project by seeing if they can outdo the last war film by illustrating even more horrific injuries then the last film (Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldiers). I think we got the blood splatter on the camera lens at least 3 times in WWS.<br/><br/>Remember Elias getting killed in Platoon. Not a limb missing or head exploding in sight (ok, the squibs didn't go off) but still dramatic and moving.<br/><br/>Did the American soldiers carry entrenching tools? I would have thought that in a battle like that soldiers would have been digging in with spades, helmets or even their hands. A lot of them seemed to be relying on vegetation for cover. It's not paintballs being fired.<br/><br/>Another thing that irks me are the next of kin notifications coming in while the battle rages. ""The army wasn't ready"" says Moore's wife. They seemed right up on ther play with forwarding the bad news home. How could they have had an accurate idea of casualties in the middle of the battle when most of ther KIA were still down in the field. I would have thought it may have been a couple of days or longer before next of kin could be notified.<br/><br/>I realize what the director was trying to do here but he broke up the momentum of the film and the grieving widows after the battle and near the end of the film would have been a far more realistic and poignant ending to the film, especially contrasted with Moore being able to return home to his family.<br/><br/>I seem to be being very negative about the film. However, as stated before, it's not a bad film but it's disappointing because it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Worth seeing."

","We were soldiers is the war movie to see if you are looking for perfection. The uniforms (as far as I can tell) are perfect. Placement of the ribbons, badges, and insignia all seem to be correct. And the characters are realistic. Take Sgt. Major Plumley for example. Here is a man who has had more than his share of combat, a real tough nail...what kind of a guy is he? A hardass.<br/><br/>Most of the camera angles are excellent, but as in saving private ryan, one or two of the scenes has blood splatter on the camera. This was probably done on purpose though, for more of a news type feel to the movie. The movie is not without flaws though. For one; I think it should have been a little longer. The scenes having to do with the wives covered the humanistic side of the movie, but while they were there, they weren't long enough. But that is just my opinion. The combat scenes were spectacular. The napalm actually looked and acted realistically. And that vietnamese incendiary grenade looked quite realistic. But that scene where the Sgt. is dying and he tells someone hes glad he could die for his country. Nah, I would be very dissapointed.

","This movie reeks of cliches and historical fantasy. Mel Gibson hams it up as the good Christian colonel who loves his men like his own sons, and apparently is untouchable by bullets or scratches despite wandering into heavy firefights. We also have several other characters like a young father, a grumpy stern CO, the outcast soldier, and so on. You know, typical cliched characters you'd have seen in previous war movies (the absolute worst has to come from Wallace's poor portrayal of Blacks). As a result of this, I felt no pity for them. They weren't believable so how I can show emotion, I ask you?<br/><br/>The basic plot behind the movie is this... American soldiers are sent mindlessly into a valley for no explainable reason so they can fight X-number of NVA. They are indeed outnumbered and so the contest of wits between Mel Gibson's blue eyes versus the NV leader begins. I'm pretty sure Wallace was trying to get this whole setup out of the way as quickly as possible so he can really bring WAR onto the big screen. Now when I say he brings it, he really brings war. His production crew must have had a field day trying to drum up every possible way a soldier can die in that battle. The firefights themselves were pretty decent and accurate portrayals although some of the scenes in the movie were questionable and downright obscene (the search for the missing platoon was fictitious and how the Americans drove the NVA from the hills was also fictitious).<br/><br/>
No only was the movie cliched, and poorly written, but I should also add We Were Boring.

The movie is not true to the book, though. The script takes the main storyline, cannibalizes it by shuffling around some historical facts and anecdotes, pumps it up with clich√©s and macho gestures and adds some dramatic fiction for good measure including an ending, that manages to even depict the Americans as some sort of winners. This can hardly be called accurate. Then again, surely there even are people who regard Cecil B. DeMille's Ten Commandments as an authentic depiction of the Old Testament.<br/><br/>The cinematography furthers the fictionalization of the battle by use of overly dramatized and effect loaded images. Still, the photography and the effects are good.

I'm the child of a career marine who served two tours of duty in Viet Nam. As someone who grew up living on bases I can tell you it says something very important. It seems that too many war movies display just the horror of war but fail to understand the human toll, on the servicemen and their families. My own father was very much like the character that Mel Gibson played in the movie. He saw himself as more than just a professional but as someone who was honorably serving his country. My own experience was going to a high school where almost all the student's fathers were serving overseas in Vietnam. On average once a week the principal would come down and ask the teacher to step out. This was followed by the teacher asking one of my classmates to accompany the principal down to the office to be met by their mother to find out that dad had been killed in action. There was always a feeling of the the heart stopping when the principal came to the door. I can appreciate the scene in the movie where the cab driver comes to the door to deliver the sad news. Excuse me for digressing, but the point that I'm trying to make is this movie really does come close to what it's really like to be a serviceman and what the families of servicemen have to endure.

","I was reluctant to see ""We Were Soldiers"" at first because I thought it was just another bloody war picture about heroism like ""Saving Private Ryan."" More than six years after its release, for the heck of it, I lent a copy from my local library. This movie is much more than about heroism and patriotism. For the first time I saw in a war film, the story focuses not only on the battlefield, but also on the men's families and wives, as they face fear of the knock on the door from a cabbie, telling them that their husband died in combat. This added a great deal of emotion to the characters of the film. I don't feel just sorry for the soldiers receiving gruesome deaths, but for their wives and children that they'll never see again. In a sense, this makes the film an anti-war picture. There maybe courageous acts and bravery in war, but it always comes with a heavy price.<br/><br/>The lead and supporting actors were all diligent in their roles. Mel Gibson is not the typical action hero that I had expected from ""The Patriot"" or the ""Lethal Weapons"". He's a man in a hellish war in which he focuses not just on his own survival, but also for his men. I rank his performance in this as one of his best. I'm disappointed that he didn't at least a golden globe nomination in 2002. <br/><br/>Director Randall Wallace, who helped Mel with ""Braveheart"", is wonderful as a director. He captures some intense and brutal battle scenes that are amazing, yet at times hard to watch (particularly with the napalm sequence). Dean Semler's photography is sweeping, plastering beautiful surroundings that are swamped by war. Nick Glennie-Smith's score has a triumphant sound, but at the same time is haunting. This develops a grim mood for the film. And lastly, I was thoroughly impressed with the sound effects editors. From what I saw on a documentary, all the gunshots and explosions were recorded after filming. They did a hell of a job making the audio fit the video. Bravo! <br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is a superb film that reminds everyone not only the horrors of war (both on the battlefield and at home), but also the courage men in the past and today are willing to take for our nation."
"PudgyPandaMan","8","5","9","20 July 2008"," Very gripping and intense depiction of war
","I was just born right before the Vietnam ""conflict"" started, so of course I have no personal recollection of events. But my mom's 1st cousin was a chopper pilot there, and my husband's Uncle also served in combat there. So I grew up hearing bits and pieces - although neither man would ever discuss it in detail.<br/><br/>So I was very interested to see what I have heard to be a realistic account of one of the battles of Vietnam. Like Saving Private Ryan, and Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers left me with an awe and respect for all those men and women who have fought and died to give us all the freedoms we enjoy.<br/><br/>I think what has always bothered me, is how I heard these Vietnam vets were treated that returned home. I heard my mother-in-law share how her brother was spat upon, called baby-killer and other horrible names. These were young men (boys, really) that had no choice but to go when they were drafted. It was ""kill or be killed"". At least since then, it appears the country has learned a lesson how to better treat returning soldiers from the Iraq war, irregardless of people's view of the war.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is that it appears they were purposely trying to avoid political commentary. Every film about Vietnam, from The Green Berets to Apocalypse Now, seems to have a political ax to grind. Lost in all the political rhetoric of these past films have been the men who actually fought and died. This film is a tribute to the courage of the men who fought and who died there. They were soldiers and they acted like it. One can argue all day long about whether we had any business in Vietnam. But I was pleased and moved to see a film honoring the too often forgotten or politicized soldiers. Those veterans deserve this honor. Thank you to all Vietnam veterans who have suffered greatly with so little thanks from our country."

","I just recently was able to view We Were Soldiers and have watched it twice again. I have seen very few moved that have brought tears to my eyes but this one had me reaching for the tissue box over and over again. The realism was well researched and portrayed. This movie not only told the real story about war but it also displayed what a real hero is. Every soldier on that battle field was a real hero. They didn't go there seeking fame or even recognition, but to just do their jobs as soldiers. The soldier going into battle knowing full well that he may not come out displays the kind of bravery that you won't see on a baseball or football field. The men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our life styles and freedoms without asking for anything in return are the only true heroes."
"writerasfilmcritic","7","5","9","7 August 2005"," We Were Soldiers is uneven but a moving tribute to Vietnam Warriors
","This movie unfolds slowly, beginning with a somewhat corny attempt to build a picture of the soldiers at home. Mel Gibson seems to be a likable sort, although he is a bit much as the gung-ho, Bible-thumping colonel in the Air Cavalry. His wife at first seems rather unsympathetic. In fact, she looks as if she were stung in the upper lip by a bee. Her performance, and that of the other officer's wives, comes off as rather stilted. Once orders come through and Gibson's regiment are deployed to Vietnam, things pick up considerably. A wave of helicopters takes the first sixty men to a hot landing zone in the Central Highlands. The photography is impressive and the action ratchets up very quickly. Right after landing, some dope decides to chase an enemy scout up a hill into the jungle, leading his squad after him. This foolhardy act comes off as a bit absurd, but the results form an important part of the story. The small group of soldiers are cut off from the rest of the regiment, and for the next day and night, they are under continual attack from an enemy determined to annihilate them. The surviving NCO displays a coolness under fire that saves the lives of at least some of his fellows. Down with the main body of the regiment, which has been steadily reinforced, the colonel and his tough-as-nails sergeant have their hands full fending off wave after wave of enemy combatants. While some might contend that the movie is a bit over the top here and there, it does a good job of depicting the confusion, excitement, and fear of a pitched battle. Many of the scenes are gruesome and seemingly realistic, with the minor criticism that support of US troops from artillery and from the air seems a bit too instantaneous and precise. At one point, the NVA and Viet Cong are overwhelming the surrounded and outnumbered Americans and yet are cut to pieces by machine gun fire and napalm from the air. At the same time, however, some of the Americans are killed or seriously wounded from friendly fire simply because the targeted enemy is right on top of them. The guy who plays the determined North Vietnamese commander does an effective job, sending so many of his troops to their deaths in trying at all costs to defeat the Americans in their first major battle and win an important psychological victory. It might be said that ""We Were Soldiers"" attempts to honor the enemy nearly as much as it does our own forces. They certainly died in much greater numbers than we did and this skirmish was no exception. Regardless of the outcome of the war, any vet who survived a struggle of this intensity should hold his head high, while those who died deserve every honor accorded them.<br/><br/>An eery dirge punctuates the action at certain key moments in the battle, and after it is over, the field littered with corpses, the colonel (it is said) finishes his tour of duty and finally returns home to be reunited with his family, one of the lucky ones who came home physically and mentally intact. When he rings the door bell and his wife, fearing the worst, sends the kids to bed and opens the door, it is a very emotional moment. The credits then begin to roll to a moving anthem. So, although the movie takes too much time to get rolling, it has a strong patriotic finish and seems to be a fairly accurate, if somewhat propagandized depiction of battle in the Vietnam era. On balance, it is a good, stirring war movie much more like those about WWII than the usual cynical offering about Vietnam. Worth watching more than once."
"pbillington2001","10","5","9","3 August 2004"," Leadership 101
","Awesome film. I was skeptical of Mel Gibson playing an American hero at first---that is, until I saw the movie. Arguably, the best parts of the movie are when young officers are being trained as leaders not just officers by the moral centre of the movie, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, who is played by Mel Gibson. There are two very good speeches in the film: No one gets left behind, and second, Using Helicopters in War. Moore's leadership in battle is also captivating as he exhorts his men to keep their composure under fire in numerous scenes. Truly an inspirational film of what it means to be a real leader in this age of anti-heroes. If you're feeling down and discouraged and are in need of an emotional lift, this is the film to see."
"tfrizzell","Null","5","9","25 March 2003"," Better Times Than These.
","Totally ignored and under-rated in 2002, ""We Were Soldiers"" was one of the top 10 films of yet another excellent cinematic year. The conflict in Vietnam is looming and the U.S. is about to get involved in some heavy combat and casualties are imminent. Mel Gibson leads the very first group of some 400 American men into a hot zone where 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers are waiting. What follows are intense fire fights and the realizations of love, devotion, admiration and friendship for all Americans involved. While there have been several excellent films on the topic of Vietnam, ""We Were Soldiers"" is different from the others in the way it shows the emotional battles occurring back home in the states of those who are waiting for their husbands, fathers, brothers and uncles to come home. Madeleine Stowe, as Gibson's wife, is solid as she always is as the primary woman struggling with the events taking place overseas. A strong cast which includes Keri Russell, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliott, Barry Pepper and Chris Klein completes the strong film. Randall Wallace (who wrote the screenplays for the amazing ""Braveheart"" and the disappointing ""Pearl Harbor"") shows an uncanny knack as a film director. He uses an odd Frank Capra-styled way of telling a story that is highly dramatic and highly life affirming at the same time. ""We Were Soldiers"" is an excellent film that should be embraced, especially in this chaotic time when other events overshadow the world of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5."

"pc_dean","7","5","9","3 May 2002"," Choppering into the Little Big Horn
","If LtCol Harold Moore did not actually exist, it would be necessary for Hollywood to invent him.  A tough-talking, straightforward leader of men, equal parts swagger and heart, he loves his troops like his own children, refuses to leave the combat zone while his boys are in the sharp end, and sheds tears for the fallen in between barking orders into a radio handset and shooting charging enemies through the head.  The crazy thing about Moore, and about ""We Were Soldiers"" in general, is not how much is Hollywood hokum, but how much seems to be but isn't.  Moore is a real person and he was by all accounts (including, but not limited to, his own) a tough soldier, a shrewd commander, and the kind of crazy SOB who would be the first to go in and the last to leave.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is the story of Moore and his 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (Custer's old unit) in the Ia Drang valley, the first major confrontation between American and Vietnamese troops.  This alternately brilliant and exasperating movie is based on a book by Moore and UPI reporter Joe Galloway, with the cumbersome but oddly poetic title ""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young"".  It begins with Moore's assignment to the Army's first dedicated air cavalry unit, which is among the first US combat troops sent to Vietnam.  What starts as a mission to destroy an enemy force that attacked an American base becomes a brutal siege as the Cav are surrounded and trapped, 395 men pitted against nearly two thousand of the enemy.<br/><br/>Moore is played by Mel Gibson, who adeptly portrays both the paternal kindness of a decent man and the manic glint so common in good infantry officers.  Unfortunately, the movie focuses so much on him that it loses some of its big-picture scope.  After a while it begins to seem that Gibson is everywhere; no firefight can commence unless he fires the opening volley, no act of valor passes without a shot of Gibson's eyes welling up with pained pride at the sacrifice of his soldiers.  A little of this is good, too much of it is bad.  Moore probably was larger than life, but Gibson's Moore almost threatens to be larger than the movie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is led by Sam Elliott, whose Sergeant Major Plumley is destined to take his place among the greatest flinty NCO portrayals in film history.  Barry Pepper plays Galloway, and delivers the movie's intro and epilogue, though he doesn't appear until late in the movie.  The movie parallels the story of the battle with that of the officers' wives, led by Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore.  The wives' story is given some short shrift (and some very clumsy scenes), though it is in parts so wrenching it is almost a relief to return to the war zone.<br/><br/>One memorable passage in Moore's book likens the sound of a bullet hitting flesh to that of a canoe paddle slapping wet mud, an image that is at once comical and horrifying.  We have come to expect graphic carnage from our war movies these days.  However, instead of the rapid-fire speed-lapse photography seen in ""Saving Private Ryan's"" unforgettable Normandy sequence, writer/director Randall Wallace offers more straightforward depictions of the businesslike horrors of close combat: he doesn't use a lot of camera tricks to communicate the concept of chaotic violence, he just fills the screen with chaotic violence and lets us watch it in its unflinching fury. And call me an air-show junkie, but he has some beautiful sequences of Hueys diving over hilltops, flying in through smoke, etc.<br/><br/>Most latter-day war movies give a nod to the enemy, making him human, not a faceless monster.  For all this movie's flag-waving sentimentality, it's actually better in this regard than most.  The Vietnamese are not fearless stoics; we see a young NVA infantryman panting and wide-eyed with fear as he charges the equally afraid Americans (something even anti-American screeds like ""Platoon"" never showed).  It's also instructive to watch Moore and his opposite number (Don Duong) moving among their troops doing similar things: offering encouragement, making stirring speeches, and plotting the demise of the other.<br/><br/>This is a battle picture, a movie that exhaustively analyzes a single big-picture event in a war.  While movies of this type have been made for years, this is one of the very few to come out of Vietnam.  The pantheon of great (and not-so-great) Vietnam movies all have one thing in common: they portray specific events that did not, strictly speaking, actually take place.  Those movies are more about Vietnam as a general phenomenon than about anything that quantifiably happened there.  In this way, ""We Were Soldiers"" represents something quite daring: Wallace has made an early-40s WWII movie about the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>And that's part of the problem: the movie has far too many places where it goes for overblown sentiment and emotional manipulation, often hokey to the point of embarrassment.  The fact that many of the cliches are true and many of the corny Hollywood moments are based in fact does not excuse slathering them in high melodrama.  This is doubly a shame because these scenes overshadow some stunning moments that work better for being small: none of the shots of Moore's eyes misting at the loss of his men can match the power of a scene that shows him standing by himself, his back to the camera as his shoulders shake with his unseen sobs.  This is a good movie, but it misses its chance to be a great movie because it doesn't trust us in the folding seats to adequately grasp the point.<br/><br/>When ""We Were Soldiers"" goes wrong, it makes you want to roll your eyes. But when it gets it right, it cuts straight through to you with a sound like a canoe paddle slapping wet mud."

For the non-americans this movie offended, I can only say proudly this was an American movie about American heroes in what most Americans feel like was a tragic war that we wanted no part of. This movie was needed to give insight into the realities of the Vietnam War. I have 4 Vietnam War veterans in my family. All four saw combat either in the Marines or Army. Only one ever saw any drug use and he worked side by side with with a group known then simply as ""The Company"".   This movie is excellent and should be a must-see for every American Teenager.

I had great expectations, I was looking forward to see this movie, damn' I even checked the IMDB rating¬Ö<br/><br/>The movie starts with the ordinary `We are proud American soldiers ready to die for our country' crap. Every soldier is a hero, a perfect husband and a loving father with a great family living in a nice house. The first 45 minutes are a serious version of The Truman Show. And yes¬Ö you'll see crying children asking daddie `What is war?'.. and yes you'll see the badass old veteran being harsh against the young soldiers.. and yes surprisingly you'll also see a young soldier that is deeply in love with his wife and wonders if ""the war is right or not""..<br/><br/>Unfortunately the first 45 minutes are the best part of the movie. It seems that after the soldiers arrive in Vietnam, the director stopped using the manuscript and started to improvise the whole movie. The rest of the movie is a huge and brutal orgy in the exchange of fire between Americans and Vietcong. The problem is that the war part of the movie is so crappy made that sometimes I couldn't believe my eyes that none of the people involved in the movie, said `Guys, this is bad¬Ö!'.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing is probably how unrealistic the fire fights actually are. Most of the Vietcong soldiers have one mission ¬ñ to run towards the Americans and start shooting only within 10 meter range. It's like playing a badly programmed computer game with non-existent enemy AI. Another annoying thing is that classical `Rambo-syndrome'. The `less important' American soldiers are dying all over the place. The bullets are hitting the ground just a few inches from the main characters but are they hiding and taking cover? Of course not¬Ö They standing in the middle of the action and kill every bad guy they spot..<br/><br/>Don't expect the unexpected in this film. Every time a soldier tries to go back and pick up a wounded team mate, he will die. Every time someone dies, he will always have enough time to say `Tell my wife I love her' before he closes his eyes.

They're bleak, and either traditionally one-sided ""all american heroes"", or plain cannon fodder. There simply aren't any interesting characters around for the viewer to focus on.

","Film Review:<br/><br/>This film Starring Mel Gibson as Lt Col. Moore, Madeleine Stowe as his wife Julie, and Sam Elliot as Sgt. MaJ. Plumley, is set in 1964. The Plot and theme of this film are both about War; however, the plot is about the survival of a combat unit in one of the first battles in the conflict of Vietnam. The theme centers on the brother hood and unity of the soldiers of this conflict, as they fight for victory and survival against over whelming odds. This film shows much more than a traditional film in the war genre. It depicts the soldiers as individuals with everyday struggles and that of the families they leave behind while fighting. (Wallace, 2002)<br/><br/>This film is unique in my opinion, because it is the first war film that I have seen that tells the story of soldier's on both sides of the conflict, as men, details the fear, anger and frustration felt on both sides, while providing the audience with a realistic view from the objective point of view. The closes up shots on the faces depict the feelings of the actor's without need for voice over narration or explanation. The lighting and special effects of the film add a sense of realism, where the action and the effects flow together well. This is not a typical war film where the simple objective is to blow up as many things as possible. When Lt Col Moore and Sgt Plumley are talking about the possibility of defeat, the hard-nosed sgt. Tells the Col. That he will win when he says the col is no comparison to General Custer, This sets the tone for a shift in the action, where the US soldiers start to overcome the odds of defeat. (Wallace, 2002) In the end scenes where, Col. Nguyen Huu An is speaking to one of his Vietnamese soldiers' while they are collecting bodies it is apparent to me that this is a message that regardless of what side your on in a conflict, it is sometimes forgotten that before they were solders, they were simply men with families. (Wallace, 2002)<br/><br/>This film also does an excellent job of telling the story of the families the men leave behind, as well as addressing the issue of racism, as it existed in 1964. One of the most memorable characters of this film besides Col Moore, is that of reporter Joe Galloway, who put himself in harm's way to document the heroism of the men that fought, the use of still photography in the film, to represent the pictures he took, sends a very silent yet powerful message to the viewer. (Wallace, 2002) This film may have some resemblances to Apocalypse now, as it is also a war film set in the same period. However, it definitely does not tell the powerful story of men and the brother hood of soldiers as this film does.<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>Wallace, R. (Director). (2002).

","The Viet-Nam War was not about one man, nor of the 58,000 we lost or even the Million America killed, it was more. The movie is called "" We Were Soldiers "" and it depicts the true story as recalled by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and Joseph L. Galloway. The Viet-Nam conflicted had already been waging between the French Government and the Vietnamese people, before it became a U.S. problem. In 1965, in a place called 'The Valley of Death' a company of French soldiers were ambushed and massacred in that valley. In that same year, Lt. Col.Hal Moore, Sgt.Maj.Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) and Maj.Crandall (Greg Kinnear) and his men are given the task of going to Viet-Nam and assessing the military capacity, veracity and fortitude of the Viet-Cong soldier. Despite being a Veteran combat soldier, Moore and his skilled Air Calvary arrive in Landing Zone Ray and are immediately engaged by a highly seasoned and well disciplined armed force. For the next three days, Moore and his men are attacked, surrounded and nearly wiped out by veteran commander Lt. Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don) who proves an intelligent and worthy opponent for the American Commander. Barry Pepper plays Joe Galloway a courageous Photographer who captures the dark, dramatic action and all it's savage brutality on film. This film is a solid well-acted and beautifully choreographed action film which displays both sides of the battle with gut-wrenching reality. Be prepared for War at it's most horrendous. The heart of this movie is the fact the director includes not only the war-zone at it's most bestial, but the heart-ripping sorrow of the Women who loved one's are being butchered while they receive a telegram informing them of their loss. This is not a film for the faint heart, but for anyone who's brave enough for a Real movie of the Viet-Nam War. *****"

"zaisjr","10","4","7","2 February 2010"," Finally a war movie that properly depicts a battle.
","My father is a Vietnam vet. He rarely talks about Vietnam, and when he does, he talks about boot camp or his training. He won't ever talk about the battlefield. So I knew this film had to be decent because he loves it. He only likes three war films that I know of, this one, Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers. Here's why this movie is amazing. 1. The movie is about an incredibly important part of history and shows how gruesome the first attack was in Vietnam. It also shows how, once again, France got us into a war that they couldn't handle. 2. It's incredibly realistic. My father thought that one scene might have been too influenced by Hollywood, until he found the actual footage of the battle. In one scene the Vietnamese soldiers just charge in aggressively and are being shot at close range by U.S. soldiers. It all looks more John Wayne then anything at first. But as the movie showed us, there was a reporter there filming the events that took place. His footage is available online. Sure enough, it shows Vietnamese soldiers doing an all out charge at the U.S. soldiers and looks just like the scene depicted in the movie. The movie showed how grueling war can be and how one quick decision can be fatal. 3. Sam Elliot. I was blown away by his take on Sgt. Plumley. Amazing. He played the part of the grumpy and pessimistic... but tough sargeant. It was almost as if they had hired a drill sargeant to do his part. 4. The movie depicts perfectly the sacrifice that the soldiers and families give up. It demonstrates that the war wasn't just in Vietnam, but it was also carried over here on the backs of soldiers and bared by the families and wives of these very soldiers. No soldier was cast as a major hero nor as some major action superstar. They were cast as soldiers, plain and simple. The movie asked for no glory, no praise, just for you to listen. As one Vietnam vet said, ""This is our story"". 5. The music to the movie was great, especially since it was performed by the military's own. <br/><br/>I recommend seeing this film. It's not a ""feel-good"" movie or a movie made for pure pleasure. It's made to show the story of the soldiers. It isn't meant to push a political belief nor to protest anyone. It tells a story, an amazing and true one at that."
"raven_1-1","Null","4","7","28 July 2009"," How realistic can this be? SPOILERS
","An average film in my opinion, when viewed purely as a war film without bringing an agenda to the table. I am biased I suppose as the characters in this film were very one-dimensional and I prefer war films that explore characters without the full-on action shown here (apart from the frankly boring wives scenes). Although based on a true event, I have to question how realistic this film can be, especially as it stars Mel Gibson, who has made many historically inaccurate films. The reason I question its accuracy is because of the terrible ineptness of the Vietnamise soldiers, whose only tactic seems to be to march in a straight line into automatic fire. The soldier with the bayonet advancing towards Gibson and his group could easily have wiped them out with a burst from his AK47, and the isolated platoon could have been dealt with using grenades or mortars. Instead the Vietnamise advance whilst noisily bunched together and never seem to get off a burst of fire no matter how close they are. Were the Vietnamise soldiers really so bad as shown here? It seemed at times like some rubbishy John Wayne film. This spoiled the film for me in the same fashion that the 'ineptness' of the German soldiers in Where Eagles Dare spoilt that film for me.<br/><br/>The acting was adequate, I could not go beyond that. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket were much better Vietnam war films as the acting and characterisation in those films was so good."

","War is Icky ""War is icky!"" exclaimed a US super-patriot who flaunts a UNITED WE STAND T-Shirt and drives a car plastered with US emblems. He hasn't volunteered in the current emergency to do anything other than act as a billboard. <br/><br/>Over twenty-five years later, that sums up the general US sentiment. Even in the conservative ex-urbs far removed from the effete centres of banality and liberal thought, the Vietnam War remains such a sore topic that it is hard to make a movie salable to general audiences. Despite the top line billing of Mel Gibson, WE WERE SOLDIERS sadly opened to empty movie theatres here in Eastern Long Island. The tough knot of veterans stayed home. Having seen the live staged action, they had enough. <br/><br/>The newcomers to US patriotism, singing songs, spouting slogans and flying banners didn't come to the movie either. Too gory and violent, they said. <br/><br/>The Vietnam War is a tough topic to handle for cinematography. Unlike other wars fought by soldiers who were required to see it through, the Vietnam War was fought by replacements thrown together. Most units lacked any cohesion. The Army refused to use its trained leadership; instead leadership fell to whoever was around and available, constantly changing. Even on a political level, the agenda and objectives remained ephemeral. <br/><br/>The Man and the Moment WE WERE SOLDIERS does not try to tell the whole story. It focuses on one battle in a valley in Western South Vietnam fought by the GARY OWENS BRIGADE, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, against a purported North Vietnamese Division in the early part of the war 1965. <br/><br/>The story does not begin in battle but in training of the Air Cavalry inside the US in a training programme designed to adjust Cavalry tactics to the age of the helicopter. The choice for command is LTC Hal Moore (Mel Gibson). <br/><br/>Mel excels in the part assuming the persona of Hal Moore right down to the staccotic Army accent.<br/><br/>The name for the new fighting force is the GARY OWENS Brigade, famed for having been wiped out in combat with the Sioux Indians. <br/><br/>However as deployment is implemented the President decides against declaring an emergency which will freeze enlistments. Thus the battalion goes into action at about half strength without adequate intelligence as to enemy strengths and dispositions. <br/><br/>Colonel Moore is a mountain of a man willing to make every sacrifice and endure every hardship. However the movie subtly details the obstacles the Colonel faces. No one speaks Vietnamese other than a South Vietnamese Ranger seen briefly interrogating a captive. No one knows enemy strengths. No one except seemingly Colonel Moore knows that the Viet Minh defeated the French in approximately the same location and under similar conditions. Everything about the proposed operation is thrown together. There aren't enough choppers to carry the whole attacking force in one swoop. The first wave will have to wait almost an hour for backup. <br/><br/>A Moment To Reflect There is a moment to reflect as the troops board the steel mounts for combat. The breeze of the swishing rotors hides a Gaelic War Cry blending the furies into song. How is it that Gaelic melodies so easily lend themselves to War? <br/><br/>The engagement itself breaches a canon of strategy: never plan an attack without securing your staging area. The landing zone (LZ) is quickly overrun by enemy forces compelling Colonel Moore to improvise another site. As battle is joined Higher Headquarters waffles. The brass even General Westmoreland want to recall Moore the trained tactician and to send in a brevetted replacement. Moore ignores the order and fights on with the men. <br/><br/>Certainly the vignette explains the many brevetted commissions from that war. Were other real life commanders as faithful to the unit and to the men as the story makes claim for Colonel Moore? Who can be sure? <br/><br/>Fighting is toe-to-toe and nose-to-nose. A napalm strike hits US forces. Ultimate success in a temporal sense is won for the Americans who by the touch of a feather put the Viet Cong to flight. <br/><br/>The cost to the US is frightful. Nearly half the Gary Owens brigade and almost all of its officers except Colonel Moore have been killed. General DeGaulle, then President of France, remarked caustically, Americans have learned little from our mistakes. <br/><br/>But with all the victories of Vietnam, though the field is won, it is quickly evacuated and left to the enemy. <br/><br/>Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore, the Colonel's wife, to whom the dirtiest task of the war has been left by the Army, that of informing nearly all other officers' wives of husbands' death in combat. <br/><br/>If Veterans stayed away having first hand knowledge of the cost of war, this movie would be a good one for those whose patriotism is newly found in the politically correct response to current emergencies."

This movie is unique in that one of their stated goals was to get it as right as possible and never sacrifice realism for artistic license. If you haven't watched it, rent it.

","Movies about the Vietnam War were all the rage in the late '70s and '80s, however, there have been very few movies about the war made since then. The Vietnam movies of the 1980's were almost all anti-war and played on many of the misconceptions, lies, and half-truths about the American soldier in Vietnam. We Were Soldiers is not your common Vietnam movie. Instead of depicting the American soldier as a savage, ruthless killer of women and children, it does a good job of focusing on the valor and bravery of the American soldier in Vietnam. If you like action-packed war movies, this is just the movie for you. The movie takes place in the battle of the Ia Drang Valley in November of 1965, where a small company of American soldiers clashed with nearly 2000 NVA regulars in the first major battle of American involvement in Vietnam. The film is based on the book ""We Were Soldier once and Young"" and follows the characters of Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway, the author of the book. Without giving too much away, the entire 80% of the movie is bitter fighting in the valley, and 20% depicts the wives and loved ones of the men fighting in the battle and how they deal with the stress and strain of losing their loved ones. Like I said before, this is THE BEST Vietnam movie out there, and after you watch it go thank every Vietnam vet that you know."

Hollywood mass-produces them and indifferent films with different casts parade on the theaters.<br/><br/>But the thing we are really tired of is Anti-Vietnam movies, with the message ""We Shouldn't Be Here"" written all over them. I don't argue that America should battle there, but the message has become boring after watching it over and over again. ""Platoon"" brings together everything I hate about Vietnam movies so it's the worst example for me, with ""Born on the 4th of July"" close behind it.<br/><br/>But I know that Kubrick and De Palma used the same setting to produce masterpieces ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Casualties of War"".<br/><br/>""We were soldiers"" does not excel like the two I mentioned above, but is definitely a good movie despite those negative criticism it got from the critics. First of all it is an anti-war movie, not anti-Vietnam. It has a humanitarian attitude. ""Thin Red Line"" has the same attitude but so much that it was a distraction. Randall Wallace, gives a good mixture of combat and humanity.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is his usual self and does not disappoint. Gregg Kinnear delivers a decent performance as ""Snake"" and it was an interesting change to watch Sam Elliott without his legendary mustache.<br/><br/>Violence and bloody scenes can disturb the ones with a weak stomach, but if you like a decent war movie, forget the critics and watch ""We were Soldiers"""

","This being one of them. Honestly, if this is your interpretation of a good film, there are two possible answers: 1) You have never seen a good film or 2) You are dumb. There's really no way around this, and I'm sorry if you happen to be dumb (and extra sorry if you've never seen a good film). No, I'm not saying every film must be a Fellini masterpiece - not at all. There are plenty of terrific popcorn flicks. However, this is not one of them. Aside from probably realistic action sequences (I can't say, I've never been in a war), this film fails on all levels. The script is embarrassingly lousy, the acting (with minor exceptions) amateurish, and the film seemingly goes out of its way to depict a true story inaccurately. If I'm wrong, please correct me, but I'm gonna take a stab at this and say... Opposed to what the film would have you believe, not every American, whom this story concerned, was a wholly good and moral person. I mean, for god's sake, all people have faults. If you're going to so painstakingly try to present this as a true story, at least attempt to portray these people as real human beings. But like I said, there can be wonderful popcorn flicks. However, nothing in this film comes off as sincere. It all comes off as forced and cheesy (but not in the enjoyable campy Star Wars manner). This makes the film wholly unenjoyable, even at a mindless level, unless ALL you want is to see lots of people get shot. And if that's all you really want out of a film, well, there's nothing I can really say to you except ""don't breed."" Skip this one.

","I consider We Were Soldiers an okay film at best. It conveys a simple message, and we understand the gist of the first major battle between the U.S. and North Vietnam. However, as it goes into details, that's when things start to go awry and near borderline tedium and boredom. My main problem lies with Randall Wallace's approach into making this film. Aside some shoddy directing, the script was mediocre. Unlike previous Vietnam War movie attempts, Wallace gets rid of all the negative aspects of the war (refreshing change), and fills the movie with good Christians and loving fathers versus a determined enemy composed of mostly cannon fodder. I liked how he portrayed the NV leader as a strategist, and a bit of human emotion (he is defending his homeland from the American invasion) but can Wallace do better than letting the NV soldiers run mindlessly towards blazing M-16s? Another question, what's the deal with the tacked on fictitious scenes towards the finale? Is this supposed to be more patriotic and dramatic? Hardly. The acting was average at best. It's difficult to deliver good characters with solid development, and recount the events of a major battle all under 2 hours, but it CAN be done. See Glory for a prime example. We Were Soldiers, falls a couple of steps short however. BUT, I can pardon that because like Black Hawk Down, this movie was made to only tell you about the La Drang battle and not provide characters to remember.<br/><br/>Of course, all of these questions are a matter of personal preference with war movies. You either feel moved by tear-jerking scenes, or you can be joes like me that simply don't buy it (especially those who've read the novel).

"F. Poole","1","5","10","3 March 2002"," We Were Country-Loving Fascists
","Without getting into too many more details than necessary, it should be said that this movie was sexist, racist, badly cast, poorly photographed, and so terribly scored it hurts. To make matters worse, the dialogue was generally didactic, uncreative, and therefore unbelievable.<br/><br/>**WARNING: Some spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>The overbearing Catholicism didn't help either; particularly when referring to the enemy as ""heathens"" in one of Gibson's many moments of prayer in this feature.<br/><br/>None of the women's roles in this film had any substance or character. This does not separate them from the men, but it is particularly important to note because the film never spends enough time with them to develop their characters in the first place. It is as if the film is only hopelessly seeking to reach a wider audience than its competitor, Scott's Black Hawk Down, by recognizing that good Christian soldiers have good Christian wives at home, who weep when they die. Furthermore, that one such wife would mistakenly assume that a sign for ""whites only"", at a local laundromat, was referring to the type of laundry allowed is simply embarrassing. (This may have been an attempt by Wallace to set his film in its specific time period as music from the early sixties was completely absent from the movie. Either way: embarrassing.)<br/><br/>Racial issues, as with the women's roles, are so poorly dealt with in this film that it is unclear as to why the topic surfaces at all. Wallace's attempt to seem ""multi-cultural"" by having Gibson directly address the very mixed-racial nature of his unit (this is what I meant by didactic) is completely undermined by the lack of non-white actors in any of the leading roles. These other ethnicities only surface to be mutilated by typically exploitative Hollywood war violence, later in the picture.<br/><br/>It is conceivable that Wallace and Gibson were simply unable to get any talented non-white actors interested in their project, particularly because the rest of their casting decisions are unlikely choices for a war movie. Both Chris Klein and Greg Kinnear appear out of their respective elements here. This, in all fairness, may have been the intention of the filmmakers as both roles present an over-exaggerated contrast to that of Sam Elliot's roll as a hard-nosed and frequently amusing rip-off of Lee Marvin. For Lee Marvin fans, unfortunately, Elliot's presence only serves as a reminder that the world of cinema has seen so many superior, though less graphic, war movies before this.<br/><br/>In fact, possibly the film's greatest inferiority with respect to its most recent counterparts is its often uninspiringly composed and poorly lit cinematography. Two or three shots (I'm not sure which) that stand out as particularly amateur are one master shot of an evening dinner/dance (possibly the only scene in which the soldiers, other than Gibson and Klein, actually interact with their wives) that is just so poorly lit that even the American flag (center frame) looks weak and tired. The other shot (or shots) takes place as Gibson and the other soldiers are waiting for the bus. In one shot, unreasonably bright practicals light the soldiers and in (possibly) another they shed light on three very large radio antennas, for no apparent reason. That is, unless Wallace was trying, in an extremely amateur fashion, to emphasize the solid (and extremely phallic) nature of the US soldier that is prepared for war.<br/><br/>As the skilled combination of sight and sound lie at the heart of great cinema, it can be said that the quality of the cinematography may have been bearable had the musical score not been so gut-wrenchingly awful. One moment they're building suspense by ripping off Hans Zimmer's virtuoso score from a better war film, Mallick's The Thin Red Line, the next moment (as well as three more times through out the picture)  they're using a completely inappropriate Scottish (?) ballad that is totally distracting from the scenes it accompanies. This ballad was probably meant to remind us that Wallace and Gibson once teamed up to make a film that was actually pretty good.<br/><br/>As much as I was truly nauseated by this picture I must concede that the rest of the audience, as well as the majority of reviewers on IMDB, seems to have been sincerely touched by its efforts. I will probably never truly understand why. However, one positive thing that I can say with regard to this picture is that it seems now that Mel Gibson may be only one or two contrived epics away from topping Kevin Costner's brilliantly (and I do mean brilliantly) cliched epic, The Postman. If this be his goal, I wish Mr. Gibson the best of luck."

They didn't even try - unless you think Viet Nam is mostly 6-inch tall grass and a few 15-foot birch trees planted by a landscaper a week before.<br/><br/>The filmmakers were obviously aware that the golf course didn't look very real, which really blew the cinematography. They had to frame every shot so that it didn't reach beyond 20 feet and reveal the potted trees they drag around as the ""jungle."" Along the way, they throw in every single war movie clich√© you could ever imagine and a person who has never seen the movie will probably be able guess most of the lines before they are said.<br/><br/>This is trash."
"abcj-2","9","3","5","24 May 2011"," This movie grounds me and reminds me that my problems are relatively insignificant.
","WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002) - This movie fascinates me because it depicts a story based on truth and the real men who fought. Vietnam is always a touchy subject. I was too young to understand it. All I know is that the first half hour makes these men real. They had wives, children, a home back at Fort Benning filled with things every other home had. But not every home was missing a father for a couple of years or, perhaps, for a lifetime like the ones in this film.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is always believable to me. I think he embodied Lt. Col. Hal Moore. No, I don't know Moore, but he's not Gidson on that screen. That's the sign of a great actor (regardless of the bad press he's had in the last year or so). This film is gory and has some unrealistic scenes thrown in for pure drama, but that's what sells tickets. A glorified version of reality. <br/><br/>However, the training, leaving the wives, the battle scenes, the large number of wounded and dead all represent events that Moore and Galloway experienced and wrote about in their book. Moore's wife made significant changes in the way the army handled the notifications. She was very supportive of her husband and was honored for her work to improve base conditions. I've read a good bit about this and that's what inspires me. These were real people who made a difference even during a difficult and much criticized war. The drama back at the base is heart wrenching. My parents were at Fort Benning just 2 years before the Moores. My mother said the people were different, but it was just like going back in time. She was in tears throughout the whole movie. <br/><br/>There are light moments with humorous scenes. There are dark ones with quiet prayers. The cast is wonderful. Sam Elliott is always a good tough guy. Greg Kinnear, Madeline Stowe, Keri Russell, and the always great Barry Pepper were all particularly good. I'll never know for sure because I wasn't there, but when I watch this great film I feel like I've met the men and women who gave up so much for a thankless job. I pray for our soldiers every night. I'm proud of our troops all over the world. This movie grounds me and reminds me that my problems are relatively insignificant. Life could be so much worse and, when it is, it still goes on."

","As a person that has watched every war movie ever made and majoring in school as a military historian, we were solders in my opinion is at least one of the top ten war movies ever made and the number one Vietnam war movies ever made.<br/><br/>The accuracy of the movie was well done right down to the equipment used in it. A lot of other movies that try to achieve this always fall short and one of them would be my top favorite movie done by George C Scott in Patton. In Patton there use of none period equipment was horrible for such a high dollar film and is the only issue I found with that film, otherwise it still rates #1 on my list, this problem was not the case in we were solders.<br/><br/>I would highly suggest everyone to see this film and that all the actors have done a top notch job in the making of this film.

","Short review: I typically do not care for Vietnam War movies. Some, like Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" are good. ""Platoon"" is alright, ""Casualties of War"" is okay... ""Hamburger Hill"" is blah, ""Good morning Vietnam"" too happy. The running theme is either firefights (which is good eye candy but poor storytelling) or the futility of war.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" has a different take. First, Mel Gibson plays a colonel with a degree, allowing him to not only think like a soldier but an academic. He understands military history and why strategies have or have not worked, and why Vietnam is as pointless as Korea was.<br/><br/>But what really stood out was the focus on the wives. The story is almost always about the boys becoming men in the battlefield. We rarely, if ever, see their parents or spouses. Here is an exception... the wives are their own squadron, bonding together and keeping strong. And that's the reality of war: people don't just die -- someone else has to feel that loss."

","This was a movie that was so good, I wanted to read the book. And, I fully intend to. My dad read it and, he a vet of Vietnam, said it was very good. Now to the movie. Good movement, good emotion, good storyline. You really get to turn Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot, and even Kinnear into real heroes. That's what war movies used to do. People idolized John Wayne and others in war movies. They were made to look invincible, intelligent, and ballsy. Gibson's character was smart, effective, and sure of himself. Main characters in movies today are unsure of themselves, not smart, and goofy, when goofy shouldn't be there. Chris Klein's character was appropriate, as the scared, yet brave, soldier. For his character, it's appropriate to be unsure of yourself, and that worked. I didn't think, at first, that I'd like the flashes back to the states with the wives on the base, but their role was very emotional, and it added to the movie, didn't remove anything. During the drafted wars, plenty of wives/girlfriends/daughters were back home feeling exactly like these ladies. Scared shitless. Any Vietnam vet would like this movie, but they might not care about the Vietnamese-sided view of the movie. But that was justified later when Gibson was guessing their attack plans, and was accurate about it. Gibson was a hero in this movie, and it's refreshing to see that again."
"elcoat","10","3","5","21 April 2010"," WWS's American Historical Review reviewer strongly recommends it.
","I wrote the February 2003 review of this film for the scholarly/professional review journal American History Review (when they were still reviewing films).<br/><br/>While drafting my review, I interviewed by telephone both General Moore and Joe Galloway, and I called them back to ask them to read them my final draft and ask them to correct any factual errors. They did not attempt to change my opinions of the film, and I wouldn't have let them.<br/><br/>(I should add that Joe Galloway has a very moving interview the Americans At War series put on YouTube, and he mentions Pvt. Jimmy Nakayama.)<br/><br/>For copyright reasons, I can't reprint here the last paragraph of my AHR review, but I can say that I said and believe that EVERY ADULT American SHOULD SEE THIS FILM, before joining the military or ever sending our young people off to war.<br/><br/>It should also be noted for historical accuracy that Mrs. (Julia) Moore did not actually deliver the death telegrams herself - a powerful dramatic device in the film, to be sure - but when she found out they had indeed been delivered by cab drivers, she personally visited and consoled every family she could locate. As Madeleine Stowe so well portrays her in the film, she is a great lady.<br/><br/>Even though the film premiered at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, it is hardly a recruiting film as some here have claimed. It is traumatically honest about the horror of war and its human cost (especially to the military community).<br/><br/>It should have received a bevy of Oscars - which would have been on the eve of our invasion of Iraq - and if it had, I think more Americans would have questioned that war and our leaders' determination to start it.<br/><br/>The Army fully supported the filming, and there was a memorial service in the Ft. Benning chapel before filming during which the veterans - especially Ernie Savage, I've been told - expressed their desire to all the members of the film company that the film be truthful, that they ""get it right."" And they did.<br/><br/>The Pentagon may have since questioned itself for supporting the film: it is as anti-war as it is pro-military.<br/><br/>WWS is equal to the other great war films Battleground (about GIs in the Battle of the Bulge) and Attack! (starring Jack Palance and real-life war hero Eddie Albert playing his demoralized, cowardly commander), and it far surpasses the likes of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Lou Coatney"
"dbacke1","8","3","5","17 February 2010"," One of the More Accurate Vietnam War Movies
","Despite all of the complaining, and some it justified, you can't hide the fact that this is definitely one of the more accurate Vietnam war films based on a real-life battle. Yes, the climactic battle scene is pure Hollywood, and I myself was very disappointed by it, but overall the events as they are portrayed in the film follow the book quite nicely. As another reviewer pointed out, it could have been one of the all-time great war films, but it fell a bit short. I do disagree with reviewers who try to paint this film as pro-American propaganda and revisionist. It is simply a Vietnam war film about the bond between a commander and his men in the field, and it was very well done in that aspect. I don't remember a whole lot of dialogue in the script about who was right and who was wrong, or why we were there. It was all about survival in the face of a determined enemy. I also don't agree with the reviewer who stated that the LZ Albany ambush was avoided in order to paint a one-sided version of the battle, because that was a separate event that didn't involve Colonel Moore or his men. Involving other units would have meant a much bigger film in scope, even though I still think that it could have been handled well. The battle scenes were some of the best filmed. However, as I stated earlier, Hollywood inevitably stepped in right near the end, and that is why the film was flawed. A more realistic climax and ending would have been much better, and still satisfying. Hopefully, some day in the future a filmmaker will avoid Hollywood clich√É¬©s and finally get it 100% right."

","As an individual who served stateside surrounded by much of the upheaval caused by individuals blindly and violently protesting our involvement in this war, I see much of the war in this film as was related to me through the eyes of comrades (primarily marines) who were actually there.<br/><br/>Like many of his recent films, Mel Gibson pays close attention to the details of his craft. In this film he lifts the audience to understand the nobility of soldiers as expressed in their dedication to each other in the times of extremis. Clearly, as with all other wars, military leaders in Vietnam badly misjudged the quantity, quality and tactics of their opposition. Col Hal Moore received his orders and lead his men into the near disaster that they found themselves in. It is only through their dedication to each other (helicopter pilots included) that they were able to prevail in this most difficult engagement.<br/><br/>This movie and its actors exquisitely capture the spirit of these men. I have seen this movie several times and still marvel at its ability to place you, the viewer, at the scene.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

","It has taken me some time to watch this movie, let alone any other of this event, the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>I sat through the video of this, and watched each and every micro second. The only other time I watched a similar movie was ""Good Morning Vietnam"". I figured with Robin Williams in it, that it would be more a comedy sort of, but my wife turned it off during the part of the young troops in the truck headed for the front.<br/><br/>This movie, ""We Were Soldiers...And Young"" fits in with what I know, what I experienced, and my feelings since. People have to remember, it was a movie, not a full blown documentary. You want a documentary, turn to PBS, you want a movie, turn to Hollywood. But as a movie, it should be seen today, by all. The men who were there, who lived and suffered, and those who died in the real place, must not be forgotten. And that goes for all us Vets. Guess that I am now ready to see some of the other videos I collected about this event. My son bought and packed those that he learned to be amongst the best. He gave it to me as a Veterans Day gift a few years ago. I finally opened it the other day. He also served in the military, saw a bit of action in the ME.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled, so did my emotions. They say that grown men don't cry, yes they do. Only an unconnected fool wouldn't. A lot of times you hear someone putting down the ""enemy"" for whatever, but don't you believe it. They are human, they had families, and they fought, no matter their cause, they fought like soldiers for their nation. See this movie. Understand it. Read the book, remember it. And on each Memorial Day, on each Veteran's Day, follow me as I toast several buddies who did not come home, then those who did, and finally, those serving today. I hope and pray that we never again have to make our soldiers wait years to be formally recognized by our own government for the sacrifices they were ordered into by that government. Public opinion is expected to be divided, expect it, cherish that. Because that is part of what we in America need to defend, the right to ones opinion, yea or nay, it is our right of freedom."
"cooperaitaliano","8","3","5","28 December 2006"," A good movie and a realistic one
","I do not particularly enjoy watching movies of this genre. I originally remember seeing We were Soldiers at the cinema and saw it last night again, this time on DVD. Firstly, the filmmakers endeavoured to be authentic in the details and the attention to detail reveals the seriousness to portray the events that occurred and reflect them with an honesty. The second is that an effort was made to show both the North Vietnamese and the US during the battle, not just from the American point of view. It did not glorify war but was sufficiently graphic to reveal that war is indeed horrifying and to dissuade those of us who may never find ourselves in such circumstances of having an illusions of it being otherwise.<br/><br/>Like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, it brings a gritty realism to film. I do not watch such films for 'entertainment'. They shock me sufficiently enough to recognise to a degree what the reality of war can be like. I say a degree, because unless any of us find ourselves physically living and experiencing such things, we will never comprehend what it is like, but in as much as is possible, I think that such films do accomplish this.<br/><br/>Before I saw the movie I understand that it depicted real events and having seen the documentary on the DVD, I appreciate further the enormous effort made behind the scenes in the making of this film. I think that it dealt with the battle, the issues surrounding it, the men that fought and died in a respectful and realistic manner.<br/><br/>Whether we agree on the larger issues of the Vietnam War, about Mel Gibson as an actor/director/person or the morality of war in general we should all be able to agree on one thing. This is that War is a horrifying fact of life in our world and that we should recognise the costs of it and respect those who sometimes find themselves fighting in it and dying in it."

","Excellent Movie!!! Vietnam and combat as it really was. I only have one problem with the story line as it is presented to the public. With all due respect to Lt. General Hal Moore and the brave soldiers of the 1st Air Cave that fought this battle; The Battle of the Ia Drang Valley was not the first battle of the Vietnam War. The first battle took place almost exactly 3 months earlier in I Corps on the Van Tuong peninsula... Throughout July 1965 evidence had accumulated showing a VC buildup in southern I Corps, especially south of Chu Lai. A deserter confirmed to interrogators that the 1st VC Regiment, consisting of the 60th and 80th Battalions, the 52nd VC Co., and a Co. of the 45th Weapons Battalion, had established a base in the Van Tuong village complex.<br/><br/>Operation Starlite was the first offensive military action conducted by a purely U.S. military unit during the Vietnam War. Originally code named ""Satellite"", due to a loss of electricity, a clerk made a typing error when the plan was being typed up and Operation ""Starlite"" was born. D-Day was to be 18 August, 1965. Lt.Col. Bull Fisher's 2nd Bn., 4th Marines, were to be heli-lifted into pre-designated LZ's inland, Lt.Col. Muir's 3rdBn, 3rd Marines, minus ""Mike"" Company, were to make an amphibious Landing and LtCol. Bodley's, 3rd Bn, 7th Marines, designated the SLF, and were to remain in reserve. These ground units were to participate in the operation with support from numerous other Marine units. Operation Starlite came to an end on 24 August 1965."

","I had low expectations of ""We Were Soldiers"", thanks to the less-than-enthusiastic critical reviews on its release. However, I decided to watch it when it was on TV recently and I was genuinely impressed.<br/><br/>The film recreates the mood and the attitudes of America in 1965. Yes, some scenes are dripping with cheese by modern standards but I believe that the film-makers did not set out to make another ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Platoon"".<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is the sort of war movie that Hollywood made when a lot of the actors and film crew had WWII and Korean War combat experience. Like the fighting men it depicts, ""We Were Soldiers"" tells the story of a battle, plain and simple. Using the memoirs of an experienced professional soldier as a starting point, the crew and cast have put together a dramatised account of America's first military action in Vietnam, the battle at la Drang.<br/><br/>la Drang paved the way for American involvement in the struggle for Vietnam's political future. Outnumbered 10-1, elements of the American 5th and 7th Cavalry Divisions fought 4,000 PAVN and Viet Cong soldiers to a standstill over 3 days. Both sides suffered heavy casualties and the battle was only decided by American air support and pin-point artillery strikes. The PAVN were forced to withdraw but were able to re-occupy the la Drang region as soon as the Americans had evacuated their casualties. As pointed out by a PAVN general towards the end of the film, the battle allowed the Vietnamese to analyse American air mobile tactics and work out a simple way to counteract them. <br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is a tribute to the Americans who fought in Vietnam, pure and simple. The film makes a few telling digs at American foreign policy, military organisation and planning and how unprepared the US Army was when the casualty reports came flooding in. However, overall this movie works hard to capture the terrifying reality of close quarter battle with modern assault weapons. The battle scenes are graphic, chaotic and bloody and are in no way a glorification of violence. The movie has been criticised for depicting waves of PAVN and Viet Cong fighters being mown down while US soldiers are picked off piecemeal, but that was the truth of the battle. The Americans dug in and without artillery or air support, all the PAVN commanders could do was order their men on the ground to attack the American defenders en masse.<br/><br/>Despite its cheesy ""Soldiers at Home"" and ""Slow-mo Death Scene"" moments, ""We Were Soldiers"" works as a war movie because it tells a story of men in combat with very little political bias and a reasonably healthy respect for historical fact. <br/><br/>Yes, there are other films about Vietnam with a stronger ""Anti-War"" message, but condemning ""We Were Soldiers"" for not being like ""Platoon"" et al is like condemning an army for doing its duty."

The battle in this film is so graphic that when i saw it in theaters i without lying can say i almost felt i was there. The acting was spectacular and portrayed the real life characters perfectly. The stunts and fire sequences combined with the knowledge of over 50 live veterans coordinating the actual events makes this one of the most accurate war films in cinematic history."

War is hell. That is a well known fact that many movies try to hide. During the Vietnam War however, the media didn't try to hide it at all, and this movie captures much of this statement in the opening statements, and does nothing to downplay it throughout the rest of the movie. Its a well made movie, showing all aspects of the battle in the Ia Drang Valley from the training of the US soldiers to the actual battle, to the commanders behind the lines, and to the wives left behind at home. It does a good job of showing that wars not only touch the lives of the soldiers fighting it but those they leave at home. Overall this movie was well written, and very well made.

This movie lets you see what we were too afraid to show in others, the horror, blood, and pain both sides went through at that first major battle. It gave me a much greater appreciation of what our soldiers are going through in Iraq and a greater appreciation for soldiers in general... I owe my freedom and life to those who have the courage to fight for this country.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers does a small justice to what can never be fully understood and paid tribute to. It left me in tears of both gratitude and disbelief.<br/><br/>To our American soldiers, and to every other soldier who has ever died in battle, you are remembered."
"crawfrordboon","7","3","5","28 January 2005"," Honest war drama not over-shadowed by Hollywood's greatest star
","Despite the political commentary that has understandably accompanied discussion of Randall Wallace's We Were Soldiers, it should be remembered that the film is primarily based on a true story, with the actual protagonists having had considerable creative input. The movie sets itself up as following the American soldiers as they make their nation's first intervention into the most controversial conflict of the last century, and, with any group of close-knit people who find themselves outnumbered, surrounded, and at war, the instinct is to root for them in their heroic battle against a faceless enemy.<br/><br/>Except that's not the full story of We Were Soldiers. Some understanding and insight into the enemy's strategy and mindset is attempted, if not always achieved, and although we rarely get to see how the North Vietnamese coped with and approached battle and death as we do the Americans, at least we have more of them than what could have been a merciless, villainous, thoroughly dislikeable conveyor belt of cannon fodder. It's made clear that everyone involved in this battle is not doing so because of their duty to their countries or their belief in ideologies or faith in religions. They are there because they are soldiers. Everything else is strictly secondary.<br/><br/>If soldierhood defines the main protagonists, their roles as husbands and fathers is brought directly into play simultaneously, as the families on the home front receive shattering news in the case of each fatality, as the conflict develops. This is a new and interesting slant taken by a film that puts itself primarily into the battleground, and although the two separate sequences struggle to gel greatly together, it is nevertheless an intriguing attempt to show the solidarity between the families in a soldiering community, and the impact of soldiering and war on a small town.<br/><br/>It's hard to fault the film in terms of realism, for we are taken right into the filth and depredation of battle to a degree fully comparable with PLATOON or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The use of helicopter pilot characters allows us to get an overview of the conflict is a welcome breath from the claustrophobic, tense, battleground sequences, which are energy sapping in their ferocity and intensity. Wallace's use of light and darkness is also a wonderfully innovative feature, both in the cases of the men on the ground, and the view from the helicopter. Special effects, such as the dropping of napalm and high explosives, are pulled off very effectively as well, but none more so than the authenticity of some of the wounds on the casualties, to such an extent the you often secretly wonder if the men will quietly slit the throats of their tragically maimed brothers in arms, to save them further indignity and suffering.<br/><br/>WE WERE SOLDIERS should not be seen as a microcosm of America's involvement in the Vietnam War, but a degree of political exploration is unavoidable in such a sensitive subject. You cannot help wonder, as the men go into action on behalf of their country, what abstract platitude they went into battle for. The environment that Col. Moore and his men find themselves in is fully believable as hell on earth, even more so than as depicted in Oliver Stone's PLATOON, simply because were are able to see that a seemingly sane, normal, calm world is just on the other end of a radio receiver. The film's biggest strength, that of underlining how men's lives became dominated and identified by their occupation, is also its largest weakness. Because of the depiction of each man as a soldier first and a personality second, it is hard to empathise with any of them, except for scenes in which they encounter each other with soldierly obligations, such as when one platoon of men gets gut off from the main group, and the rest desperately feel the urgency to come to the aid of their embattled comrades.<br/><br/>Despite its unbalanced feel, WE WERE SOLDIERS is effective at portraying the story of one individual unit in one specific confrontation. We need not worry that things seem too easy for the 'good guys,' as the horrors of war are inflicted onto them as much as they are for the enemy, who, despite having lost something like fifteen times killed the number of US soldiers, at the end watch the cavalry leave and wander out onto the battlefield with further re-enforcements. This moment, more than any other, brought home the reality that there are only wars because there are solders to fight them, and in the end, the ground the armies fight for is only as valuable as the blood that soaks into it from the bodies and hearts of the men who do the fighting.<br/><br/>The film attests to be a tribute to the soldiers who fought in the 'Valley of Death,' and despite a feeling that it ignores the wider picture it does that very effectively. WE WERE SOLDIERS may not be everyone's cup of tea, for the reasons of lack of emphasis on the hollow and needless aspects of the waste and sacrifice in Vietnam, but for a film that shows what it is like to be down in the dirt, amidst the blood and mayhem of war, it cannot be faulted."

Only a soldier can know what it's like to willfully remove himself from the warmth,love and comfort of his family to a sinful, deadly world of war. Colonel Moore dressed himself that night in his battle fatigues, kissed his children goodbye, and walked away from his family, not knowing if he would ever return again. If this doesn't make a grown man's heart buckle, I don't know what would. How many of us would do that exact same thing and not have tears flowing down our cheek? Then, if that wasn't enough, how many of us would take up a leadership position knowing full well that many of your men would not be returning to their families? Could any of us in that position live with ourselves ever again? Well, I'm sure General Moore today re-lives these very same feelings over and over. I salute you General Moore. I hope to one day meet you and shake your hand and tell you ""Thank You for what you sacrificed for this Country"". I wish to also thank Mel Gibson, who brought the General's actions and feelings to us in the way he always does - perfectly. I wish to thank Randall Wallace for making it all possible by directing this wonderful film and helping me learn more about life and the sacrifices we must all face one day. I never served in combat. I guess it wasn't meant to be. But having served in Panama prior to the invasion in 1988, I realize now just how close I came to that ultimate sacrifice.

","This is an excellent portrayal of a leader who not only trusted his men, but had their trust as well.  He expected them to do no more than he was capable of and lead them by example.  His spirit and beliefs held them together during a crucial battle that tested all he was and showed what men are capable of with a firm belief in their leader and God.  It is brutal, but that is what war is.  It also gives a good view of the other side and how, inspite of politics, each had their beliefs and values to their country and their men.  Mel Gibson's character stated he would be first on the field and the last off - that no man be left behind.  He lived up to that, and for that, deserves the deepest respect of us all.  I did not look for flaws or ""mistakes"" as I was interested in the characters and how they interacted. I even felt a sense of pride in the enemy leader, who knew this battle would be a test of wills. This was a spectacular film and I had no pre-conceived notions of a Braveheart or Patriot theme.  I saw a well-told story, of a well-covered war that tested many of us and left us a nation nearly divided."

","I've seen lots of complaints about the use of war movie cliches, unnecessary heart-string tugging, etc.  The problem with this short-sightedness is the fact that the human condition IS a cliche.  It's sad that some people find it boring that yet another GI falls on a grenade or announces the birth of his child only to die very soon afterward.  One can be assured that many GI's have experienced these circumstances.  This was war, and these things happened.  Just because it's been portrayed before and ruins a film student's idea of great cinema, does not make it a bad film.<br/><br/>The early years of the Vietnam war were a time of innocence.  It was generally thought that to allow the spread of communism was a threat to democracy in America and the rest of the free world.  It was noble to fight communism as a defense of our way of life.  At this point, America believed in the fight.  If Vietnam had been granted the right to self-rule after the end of WWII, this war would not have happened.  This movie gives us an idea of the American mindset of the time and the very brave men who fought in this early phase of the war.  Fast- forward to 1969 and the soldiers, as well as America, have a very different perspective.  There should be no comparisons to Platoon or Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>Last but not least, no one has a right to comment on ""realism"" in a war movie unless they have been in battle themselves.  Only the vets reserve that right."

","""It was a Sunday. November 14, 1965. The Vietnamese had never met the Americans in a major battle before..."" And so it begins. One of the BEST war movies about the Vietnam War today. It has an outstanding cast with a wonderful director, Randall Wallace(Braveheart). It shows the battle of the Ia Drang Valley, aka, the valley of the shadow of death. Mel Gibson does an awesome job portraying Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, the man who led some 450 men into one of the most brutal battles of the Vietnam War. Many people called We Were Soldiers ""just some other war movie"". They're wrong. This tells of a real life hero and shows how the soldiers depended on eachother, and learned to call one another brother. It also shows how the wives coped with the grave detailes of war. I have read the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young and alot of the things in the movie are very much like the book. This is the only movie I've seen that is all most exactly like the book. An extremely under-rated movie that excells above them all, I give it 4 stars!"

This film is about bravery and<br/><br/>leadership in the face of abhorrent violence and fear. Thats it. We<br/><br/>see it also from both sides, refreshingly, although the Vietnamese<br/><br/>commander was more of a tactician; probably the Vietnamese<br/><br/>saw the value in keeping such adept commanders alive, plus he<br/><br/>had the advantage of sheer numbers. We see the courage and<br/><br/>fear also of the families left behind, and are reminded poignantly<br/><br/>that the Vietnamese were human, when we see the photograph of<br/><br/>the brave bayonet charger's wife, and the respect the Vietnamese<br/><br/>commander showed for the ""enemy"" by leaving the small ragged<br/><br/>American flag behind. The image of the small dirty ragged flag on<br/><br/>a tree stump foretells the doom and humiliation the Americans will<br/><br/>eventually suffer, after years of meaningless slaughter. The<br/><br/>Americans lost the war but killed 40 times men than they lost; this<br/><br/>is a tribute to the bravery and commitment of the Vietnamese. We see Moore standing tall and vulnerable because at that stage<br/><br/>he didn't care whether he lived or died, as he had lost so many of<br/><br/>his men and felt severe guilt; like Alexander, pure luck kept him<br/><br/>alive. After his honest prayer with the young soldier in the chapel,<br/><br/>he adds a surprising comment about the Vietnamese having no<br/><br/>God etc; he remembers that he has to remain detached, or he<br/><br/>could never be an effective leader."

","Mel Gibson has had a fairly distinguished career in war films, Gallipoli, Braveheart, The Patriot, and recently, We Were Soldiers.  This film is right on so many levels.  I felt the men's emotions, which are often left out in the past Vietnam ""classics"".  These soldiers were portrayed as heroic, rather than stoned, cruel, and violent, as they are portrayed in many other movies in the past.  These men truly have something on their minds rather than who should be ""fragged"" next.  In my opinion, this may be Mel Gibson's best movie ever, and one of the best Vietnam movies of all time.  It was much better than Platoon, a movie whose characters I could have cared less about.  We Were Soldiers was not only one of the best Vietnam movies ever made, it is easily one of the top ten war movies since 1990."

The WE WERE SOLDIERS comment page is not much different. There are many people who have the balls to come right out and say that this movie is utter trash. This movie is anything but.<br/><br/>
The film is very graphic and has a very disturbing sense to it. You all can say what you want about this movie, but I think it is great. There are some very gruesome segments which made me cringe and think to myself how much I never want to experience the horrors of war. And if you thought BLACK HAWK DOWN was a graphic movie, this movie is far worse. The only difference is that this movie takes it's time in developing a story before rushing into the battle.<br/><br/>The cast is all-star: Mel Gibson, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, Madeline Stowe, and many others. There is a most shocking scene between Barry Pepper while he is trying to rescue a fellow soldier who has been badly burned. So, trust me, this movie is not for the weak of stomach. This movie is not really worthy of an Oscar award, but it is worth your time. If you enjoy this movie (which I don't see how anyone would be able to seriously be able to watch it in happy glee) but if you like it as a war movie, then you might want to check out WINDTALKERS.

"froboz","7","3","5","25 November 2002"," Interesting war movie
","This movie tells the story of the 'first' major battle between US and Vietnamese troops in the Vietnam war. It's an interesting movie. The amount of cheese and hollywood clich√É¬© is so rich, they have to be kidding. It has an ironic feel to it, much like Starship Trooper. Scene after scene is so full of hilarious gems... The best bit with the movie is the large amount of fighting. Sometimes the story is not coherent, and the same scene - americans firing perfect shots at advancing vietnamese, who fall down en masse - is repeated over and over again. But at others times it's an excellent war movie. One especially perverse aspect I enjoyed is the almost pornographic exposure of wounded persons, complete with sentimental music. They even whisper some 'perfect' last words... Another funny thing is watching Mel Gibson whacking everyone loudly on the helmets, adding his fatherly touch as leader of the american soldiers. The real advantage of the movie is that it actually tells the story about a battle. It is a 'clean' battle. That's refreshing. The typical american Vietnam movie is usually about dope smoking soldiers performing atrocities. In movies like 'Platoon' and ""Full Metal Jacket' the directors could not care less about the overall military aspect of what's happening. The overall picture told in ""We Were Soldiers"" is that the american military goal was really void of strategy - ""kill the enemy"", what a laugh - and that the tactics involved an outrageous amount of risk taking, both with lives and with the possibility of disaster for the operation. In the end, the americans pull it off. They do indeed manage to make the Vietnamese body count high. Mel Gibson then raises a tiny, tiny american flag.. if it had been a big one, someone in the theater might get offended, I guess."

","As a Canadian who has had many friends fight and some die in Vietnam, I am told that this movie was somewhat representative of what went on in Vietnam in the early months of fighting. This illustrates the American surprise at the caliber of fighting forces that the North Vietnamese possessed and it sent a message to the North Vietnamese that the Americans possessed some mechanical advantages they had not yet encountered when having to contend with helicopters and planes. The movie was not perfect and does not rate as high as Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down or even We Were Soldiers, but the message is sent clearly to the viewer and the graphic nature of hostilities is displayed throughout the battle. It is entertaining and worth the price of admission."

","Unfortunately, ""We Were Soldiers"" followed ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Blackhawk Down.""  Otherwise, it would have enjoyed more than its mostly-ignored 5-6 month theater run before being released in video. Apparently the public had overdosed on realistic depictions of combat and war stories based on real events and people. This is the only reason I can imagine for the ""so-what?"" public reaction to this fine film.  First of all, Nam vets -- especially helicopter vets -- unanimously consider this to be the truest rendering of their war. Second, it's Mel Gibson's finest work; his delivery of Col. Moore's words, and the anguish reflected in his face following this watershed battle, move many of us to tears.  There are numerous other notable performances.  The inclusion of war's impact on wives and children made the women's roles significant, rather than cameos.  Furthermore, the depiction of the NVA as (1) highly motivated and well led and (2) as human beings with families presents a more balanced view of war.  Finally, the political messages are subtly delivered and do not detract from the main purpose of the movie, which is to tell the story of war. Well worth seeing, perhaps more than once."
"southernryan","10","3","5","1 October 2002"," how can I say awesome
","I have read some of the comments on this movie and some people got it right by saying how good of a movie this was. Everyone who talked junk about it needs to realize that this movie is a tribute to all who fought in the Ia Drang Valley. Some say that Lt. Col. Moore was put up to high, I say he was not put up high enough. I wish that they would show that movie in every Army ROTC class in every school in the country. That is what a true leader does in battle. The movie was by far the best war movie I have ever seen. As a member of the military myself I appreciate the lengths that Wallace as well as all the others guys went through to make this as real as possible. Some just look at it as another 'movie', it shows the sacrifice that men make for this country. I don't think that any of the soldiers actually wanted to go to the Ia Drang Valley, but they had to. People shouldn't be critical of our Vietnam vets."

","I am glad to see Hollywood portraying a factual event about Vietnam without all of the glamour and ""hoopla"". I'm sick of seeing pieces about ""peace"" and hippies. Men fought in Vietnam because it was their duty. That fact is often lost. We were soldiers is a truly patriotic piece, not like the patriotism that soccer moms have when they fly their flags out of a mini-van window, but the kind of patriotism that war-battered soldiers know. I am a young Air Force nerd and will probably never see a single battle, but I salute those who have fought for this country and died, even if the rest of this nation might disagree with the politics of a particular war. This picture is truly sincere and embraces the fact that men of war are in fact men, with families, friends and lives. It also recognizes that in war both sides lose, and that no one really wins."

","Please note! A slight spoiler in the text!!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first thing I would like to say is that there are alot of people on this site complaining about the fact that the scenery doesn't resemble Vietnam. Before you start downgrading this movie you have to do your research properly! Not all battles of the Vietnam conflict were fought in the jungle. I believe that a lot of effort was made to depict the set accurately. This particular battle was fought in the highlands from what I understand. Second of all, before you start complaining about how unrealistic the movie in general is you should check out the comments by the people who have experience from the war in Vietnam. I do not believe for one second that this movie was intended as entertainment, it was simply meant to depict what really happened (although, apparently the final battle scenes with the bayonet charge was beefed up). I have no battle experience myself so I cannot judge the accuracy of the battle scenes, but it is reassuring to know that Vietnam veterans were used so extensively to get it right. As with most movies on the Vietnam war, I would have liked to have seen even more scenes devoted to what the Vietnamese thought and felt."

I agree with another reviewer here that one of the more memorable scenes is at the end of the film when two soldiers are in an airport going home.  The Viet Nam war movie genre is a rich one, and this one stands up with the rest.  For some reason, however, I felt the personal horror of war much more in this film than in others.<br/><br/>Gibson's performance is quite nice, too.

"Cactus-7","10","3","5","17 September 2002"," A tribute to the American soldier
","This film reinforces a lesson that the current generation of Americans have forgotten. Specifically, war will always be with us and someone had better be good at it. Those who have never served believe that war is absurd and we can all be friends with a group hug; the truth couldn't be more different. The 1965 battle of the Ia Drang Valley was, by the standards of heroism, equal to the Alamo. Without ruining the film for you, suffice it to say a handful of American soldiers from the First Cavalry (Airmobile) are surrounded by thousands of North Vietnamese Regulars. Like all American soldiers, they are a disciplined lot, fight as they have been trained and they mean to win. The crucible of combat brings out the best in them. Thankfully, ""We Were Soldiers"" also illustrates the valor of the UH-1 helicopter pilots who were such an integral part of the Airmobile operations. The rest of us may be grateful that those who would attempt to put us to the sword will have to face men like these. There are a few errors, but not many. For instance, taxis didn't deliver death messages at Fort Benning. An Army chaplain and an officer came as a team to deliver the message. Likewise, reporters didn't just jump on a chopper and head for the front. There's a little more to it than that. But Hollywood has always played fast and loose with the facts and it's unlikely that anyone would take this seriously. Sooner or later, some knuckle head will refer to this as an anti-war movie. It's not. It's just a war movie. And a damned good one."

","I was skeptical at my first glance of ""We Were Soldiers"". I like Mel Gibson and Chris Klein, but after the disastrous ""Pearl Harbor"" I really wondered if I would enjoy writer/director Randall Wallace's film. I am happy to say, despite the sketchy, at times cliche filled dialogue, ""Soldiers"" is an excellent film.<br/><br/>The movie gains unique ground dramatically when we are shown the soldiers of the film as family men, complete with wives and children. This unique little precursor to the war area of the film gave each of the major characters ample personality, something recent war films (like ""Black Hawk Down"") did not give.<br/><br/>In fact, I have never felt such an emotional connection to the characters in a war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"".""Soldiers"" is a very powerful film, although no as powerful as ""Ryan"".<br/><br/>Gibson, Kinnear, Klein, as well as Stowe and Russell, give excellent performances and the direction is well done. the only fault in the film lies in the dialogue, which is noticeably awkward at times.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent war film that deserves a spot right next to ""Ryan"" on your shelve. **** (out of four)"

","I enjoyed the resolve of Mel Gibson's character in this film and the fact that it celebrates one of the great U.S. victories in the field before the traitorous demonstrators ""back home"" took it upon themselves to put the handcuffs on our freedom fighters.  (They are squarely to blame for the fall of South Vietnam to the bloody Communists.)  Getting back to the film, I gave it 8 stars, but I was disappointed by the undercurrent of political correctness.  Three major instances stick out like a sore thumb, but remain unaddressed by others.  First, we have the united colors of Benetton represented in Moore's outfit, concerning which Moore gives a speech!  Was this historically accurate?  I doubt it.  Second, Barry Pepper's character plays a reporter who is disgusted by war.  I am a big fan of Barry's, but this character only succeeds in having us question the entire premise of this film.  His presence leaves us confused about who the real heroes are. Third, the NVA are presented with a human touch, as if they are morally equivalent to Joe Soldier.  This is ridiculous and sickening.  The North Vietnamese Army was the weapon of an evil Communist regime that would overrun South Vietnam, killing, raping, and torturing its kind inhabitants. Do we present Hitler's SS in a similar light?  Of course not, that would be anathema to the Hollywood Left.  Overall, this film is a good flag-waving epic marred by a few disturbing and utterly curious elements."

","I think the first thing I would like to point is that Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace is most definitely the best team since Don Simpson (R.I.P) and Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>This is most likely the most emotionally driven movie that I have EVER seen in my life.  I am a 23 year old male and I bawled like a little 4 month old baby walking out of the theater. Okay, call me old fashioned but the tribute to the soldiers who died in that battle which is displayed during the beginning of the end credits was probably the best and most emotionally charged experience I have ever had. <br/><br/>I think that this proves ones again that Mel Gibson is absolutely the best actor ever to walk on the face of this planet.  Hell, if you doubt me do yourself a favor, rent Ransom, Braveheart and The Patriot before you se this movie and this will prove once again my point about his ability to bring a character to life on screen and that his portrayal of Hal Moore is not just a once of thing.  Oh yeah, do not forget the unforgettable Lethal Weapon Quartet. <br/><br/>My upmost congratulations to the Cast and the Producers of this film.  You have created a masterpiece that will go down in history with same bang and admiration such as Platoon, Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan (my hats of to Spielberg by the way)<br/><br/>One thing that bothers me a little is the whole casting of Chris 'Rollerball' Klein.  Don't get me wrong, he is a very good actor and I like him a lot (SPOILER ALERT!!) and for the little while he appeared in the film he portrayed his character exceptionally good but I do not think he is action hero material.  In my opinion he is to soft a person and to well spoken and personally I think he would do better by sticking to the Romantic Comedy Genre.  <br/><br/>All and all this film would get a very realistic 12/10 and if you like your war movies make sure that you see this on the big screen.  VHS or DVD just wouldn't do it any justice."

"thom_stricklin","10","3","5","3 March 2002"," Relevant, necessary, and well-done among war movies
","Oh boy, where do I begin?<br/><br/>I guess the place to start is to talk war. War movies have been quite a ""fad"" lately, though I hope the reason for them is deeper than the word ""fad"" suggests. Still, the movies have for the most part been about World War II, a war in which there was at least a good sense of duty and of good versus evil. (The one major exception in recent war movies is Black Hawk Down, but even in Desert Storm, there was a fair sense of purpose.)<br/><br/>Vietnam, however, was a whole different ballgame. The war was poorly justified, patriotism was all but extinct, and the only thing possibly more horrid than the bloody massacres of battle was the treatment of soldiers upon their return. In terms of cultural effect, Vietnam was quite the antithesis of those other wars.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" does justice in describing this war, particularly in its earlier stages, better than any other film I've seen. It makes no bones about the fact that the entire situation was ill-advised, yet instead of pointing fingers in blame, it points out the heroes, the few whose characters shone through despite the situations, and it remembers the fallen. Though it takes place early in the war, before the counterculture and its so-called ""peace movements"" had been well-established, it still touches on the societal mistreatments that America was soon to bestow upon the very men it called to duty.<br/><br/>I really don't feel I can describe the film in enough detail. Perhaps its ambiguity in areas are what make it such a strong testimony of our most ambiguous war. Still, I think I can safely say that the film contains many of the best points of other recent war movies. It tells a true story with as much reverence as Black Hawk Down. It relates the men at war to the people they left at home as well... rather, far better than Pearl Harbor (and without any Michael-Bay Camp, either). Perhaps most significantly, it prods at the questions of war itself as good as Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>As for the cast... Mel continues to amaze with the same vein of acting as in Braveheart and The Patriot. He plays a man of many parts, and does so well... There's not a moment at home that you forget he's a soldier, nor a moment in the field you forget he's a husband and father. C'mon, it's Mel at his best, need I say more?<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear again proves what an underrated actor he is. (I'm still mad that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his role in As Good As It Gets, though he was better IMO than Helen Hunt and ol' Jack, both of whom won trophies for their parts.) The guy could be an actor with body language alone. He can give a million lines of speech by a single stare, and when he does speak, he makes it count. I only wish he'd had more screen time.<br/><br/>Chris Klein is never the greatest of actor, but one that can hold his own, and this is probably his best role yet.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot played the tough guy, the man of few words who only takes orders from men who give good ones. It was a bit too much of the stereotypical old, grizzled soldier IMO, but he pulls it off great. Reminded me so much of Lee Marvin (a la Dirty Dozen) in this flick. (BTW, Hulk fans, I am now looking quite forward to his portrayal as Thunderbolt Ross.)<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, Barry Pepper, the wives, the other soldiers, were also well cast. There were no holes in the performances. Really, the film was seamless as a whole. If there are any major points for complaint, I didn't catch them. A warning, though: Bring kleenex if you're often brought to tears by a film, and be quick to turn your head in some parts if you've got a soft stomach.<br/><br/>Thumbs up. An eleven on a scale of ten. Go see it."
"Philyteach","10","3","5","3 March 2002"," Go See it.
","As I was reading some of the other comments here I began to feel slightly enraged.  ""Not enough action,"" ""started to get boring...""  I'm not sure what movie these people saw, but it obviously wasn't the same one I saw.<br/><br/>This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Forget what the others said about cliche actors.  If you've ever spent any time on or near the military you know that a Sgt. Major acts just like the one in the movie. A good commanding officer does care about his men.  Lts and privates alike are cannon fodder. Sorry, but its a fact of life.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a true story.  If its not exciting enough the war it really happened ( or close enough anyway) thats just too bad.  Go to a theater.  I bet you see vets crying.  I know there were plenty of 40-50 yr old men with tears in their eyes when the lights came up at my showing.<br/><br/>I think the poor reviews are based more on this country's continued animosity toward the Vietnam War than on any cinematic shortfallings."
"TOWL_37","10","3","5","3 March 2002"," Graphic, but extremely well put together
","This movie is not one to see if you faint at the sight of blood. If you made it through Saving Private Ryan you will love this one. Although, even I felt a little disgusted every now and then. This movie has not only great war scenes and realistic effects, it also has some humor from Sergeant Major Plumbly. But once again this movie is not for those who don't have the composure to endure graphic violence."
"drewzter94","10","3","5","3 March 2002"," No-holds barred portrayal of Hell...
","I'm very interested to hear what my father-in-law, who was in the Marines over there, thinks about this movie, but from my perspective as a war nut, this movie was awesome. I will definitely see it again, but I can say after one viewing that this is as real as it gets, and it shows the horrors of battle (and the toll it takes on families) from both sides. The cameras definitely put you in the middle of it, and it was interesting to see what may be becoming a trend for Randall Wallace, something that carried over from Braveheart - camera shots so close to the action that blood splatters on the lens.<br/><br/>Still not on par with Saving Private Ryan (which would get a 15 out of 10 from me), but still a 10. As real as it gets; written by the men who were there."
"JCox800","10","3","5","2 March 2002"," Excellent, very moving film
","This movie is just unbelievable.  The filmography, the makeup, the action, the drama, and the characters are just so awesome.  This is the best war movie yet.  The fear and terror of war that is presented to you is very moving, and many cried while in the theater.  Some of the events that take place are shocking and you would never have guessed that it would have happened that way.  This is a must see movie.  This movie should be a grammy contender and I give it 2 thumbs up!  GO SEE IT!"
"dturturro","10","3","5","2 March 2002"," Best Picture of the Year!
","This movie was incredible! It may take the place of Braveheart for the bloodiest movie of all time. All of the characters came across well. The film makers even give us the enemy perspective. Lots of WB TV talent appear in this movie: Marc Blucas from Buffy, Keri Russell and a few others."
"Calios","10","3","5","3 March 2002"," The best War movie since I don't know when
","Mel Gibson out does John Wayne. Will now admit Mel Gibson is better than most as he pulls off making you believe his character. Sam Elliot is great also as I can name at least two Sergeant-Majors like him in personality if not in physical stature. The scenes from Ft. Benning made it personal to me cause I know those streets, this movie has to be used in various Army training courses in the future along with ""Black Hawk Down"".<br/><br/>This movie brings the realness of battle and a ill-prepared war to life. During the movie Gibson tries to explain what war is, and he comes close, but it's simply the struggle of one gang/nation/clan/group of people/tyrant or whoever you want to say struggling with a like force or party for the purpose of imposing one's will on a population or territory, whether for the good or for the bad and what's good to you may be bad to the other and vice-versa.<br/><br/>The North Vietnamese are portrayed honorably as Wallace did the Japanese in ""Pearl Harbor"". To me the battle scenes are graphic though not as bad as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""BHD"". The story does show the horror of Willie Pete, and if the do-gooders of the world want something really bad banned from existence like land mines and napalm, then this is what should be banned as it's a terrible and disfiguring substance. <br/><br/>The movie pays homage to those who took part in the Vietnam struggle and it's cause, it's too bad the leadership of that day did not understand how to do the business of war as was evident by Gibson's character being requested to go battle then taking men he had been training away from his unit and then when in the heat of battle requesting him to give a briefing back at the rear somewhere. Some men's name's should be spoken with shame and disgust. MacArthur, Patton, Marshall, Roosevelt, etc. surely rolled in their graves over how this war was conducted. Of course the same kind of leadership was present when ""BHD"" occurred too.<br/><br/>Worth seeing just on the historical insight it provides."
"vampyrz","10","3","5","2 March 2002"," The real thing...
","One of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. Icon Productions is known for authenticity. Every prop, costume and set was accurate down to the last detail. The audience can really believe this was 1965.<br/><br/>
The screenplay, direction and acting was superb, as expected. This is what Vietnam must've been like. This is not some strange ""artsy idea"" of war, it was real. Real people fighting for their own survival and that of their friends. <br/><br/>And not just the American viewpoint. The North Vietnamese were given a realistic and respectful portrayal. <br/><br/>Another excellent job of acting by Mel Gibson. Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper and Madeline Stowe shined as well in their roles. <br/><br/>After not even being nominated for best actor for Braveheart (Which I will NEVER understand) and with 'We Were Soldiers' and 'Signs' both coming out this year, Mel Gibson has yet two more chances of being ignored by the Academy. When will they come to their senses and acknowledge his acting skills?<br/><br/>This is the most accurate film of modern warfare since 'Saving Private Ryan', and is the DEFINITIVE Vietnam war movie."
"kypioneer","10","3","5","2 March 2002"," Excellent Intensity and Balance
","This is the story of the Battle of Ia Drang in Vietnam-- a 3-day battle at LZ (landing zone) X-Ray in which a little over 400 American soldiers faced 2000 of the men of the Army of North Vietnam and eked out a narrow victory. Terrible lessons were learned from this battle: the North Vietnamese learned that they could stand up to superior American firepower (helicopters, M-16s, artillery), and the Americans learned that one American with same could kill a significantly larger number of the enemy. This led to the ""meat-grinder"" theory of the war which caused so many American casualties, and an even greater number of Vietnamese deaths.<br/><br/>Basing his movie very firmly on Gen. Hal Moore's and Joe Galloway's book ""We Were Soldiers Once and Young,"" Randall Wallace has produced what I think is the very finest movie on the Vietnam War ever.  In fact, I think it is even superior to the much ballyhooed Private Ryan.  The battle scenes are intense, relentless-- and these are balanced by looks back at the homefront where the wives left behind at Fort Benning are having to cope with the loss of their men.  There is a lot seen from the perspective of the North Vietnamese as well.  This is very unusual and quite refreshing in a war picture.  <br/><br/>All the performances are good-- no exceptions.  Sam Elliot's Sgt. Major Plumley is a gruff delight as he plays the ultimate career soldier.  Barry Pepper turns in a strong performance as the journalist Joe Galloway. As for Mel Gibson-- well, this may be the best performance he has ever given. Subtly underplaying his role as (then) Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, he still embodies leadership and experience, devotion to home, duty and his men.  And at the end of the battle it is through his eyes that you experience all the pain the loss of so many of his men has brought him."
"theeleventhhour","10","3","5","16 April 2002"," The Most Vivid and Accurate Vietnam Film Ever!
","I have read the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young and for Randall Wallace (Braveheart and The Patriot) to make this movie so close to the details of the book was remarkable. I recently heard an interview with Hal Moore (Mel Gibson's character), and he said that the movie made him remember that war so vividly because of its accuracy. He also said that Mel Gibson reminded him of himself so much in the movie. Hal Moore actually took Mel Gibson around to all the grave sites of his men and introduced Mel to every single one of the men that came home in a body bag. This movie disspells all the myths about Vietnam being a war for insane villainous soldiers, instead it looked at the true soldier of this war and showed the spirit and brotherhood that binded them together. Not to forget an incredible cast of newcomers and experienced actors. This film pays tribute to all the men that risked their lives for a war that was not fought for our flag or for our country. This war turned out to be a war for each other. Now the tagline on Black Hawk Down, ""Leave No Man Behind"", was emphasized much more in We Were Soldiers, because Hal Moore and Basil Plumley did not leave any man behind. In Black Hawk Down, they left several men behind. So if you want to see only one war movie this year, use your 5 bucks for this compelling film."
"DonB-5","10","3","5","8 April 2002"," Powerful, intense, moving - a great anti-war movie
","Words alone can not describe this film.  It will touch you on an emotional level so long as you view it with an open mind and no pre-set bias.  I was amazed to read some user comments which describe this as a 'gung ho' or 'America rules the world' movie.  That simply is not the case.<br/><br/>Just as with Platoon, this film shows the horror, idiocy, stupidity, futility of war.  It is true that high stress combat situations can and will bring out the best in some, and that the media will then portray those people as heros.  But that was never the point of this movie.<br/><br/>This film clearly shows how moronic leaders like LBJ and Westmoreland spent the lives of American youth on nothing more than rock strewn fields and hills - gains quickly given up after apparent 'victory.'  It shows honor and loss on both sides of the lines as we were not the only ones to suffer.  It shows the supreme arrogance and stupidity of getting involved in the first place.<br/><br/>The effects, acting, and score are all first rate.  The haunting melody and lyric of the Irish song played during some of the scenes will not soon be forgotten.<br/><br/>This is a must see film."
"shawnalley","10","3","5","19 March 2002"," one of the best vietnam movies. period.
","As a former member of the US Army and a Drill Sergeant I saw much in the movie that seemed dead on accurate. I've seen comments here complaining about cliche`s, missing character development, and inaccurate terrain. Read the book is the first thing I'll say. Second, if you haven't been in the military and haven't seen combat then characterize your comments that way if you think something doesn't look real or is a cliche. I was blown away by how much they got right.<br/><br/>But was the movie entertaining? Yes, it was nonstop action and one situation after another where you are thinking ""no way, people actually lived through that"".<br/><br/>Lack of character development - how in the world can you say that? The beginning was your character development to get you interested in the characters. The scene where Snake#### pulls his revolver on the medivac pilot was character development (during the scene that caused his reaction I thought to myself ""man I would deck that medivac pilot next time I saw him""). Did they do it they way you liked? Maybe not, but not liking their character development isn't the same as none at all...<br/><br/>I'm curious what cliche`s people are complaining about? The only one I might agree to is the image of the senior leaders standing tall as bullets whiz by. Did it happen that way? I don't know but if it did they were lucky eh? Otherwise, what else? I just didn't see anything else that struck me as false, insincere, or there simply for effect. You have to admit they seem to be getting the damned uniforms, tactics, and lingo right these days."

This is what movie making is all about.  My hat is off to all those who participated in the making of this great film."
"spartacus01","7","3","5","13 March 2002"," A 'real' war movie
","This is definitely not in the same league as 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now'. But I must say this is a very good effort by Randall Wallace at portraying the brutalities and uselessness of war. Unlike most Vietnam movies, neither does this one try to prove who/what was right/wrong nor does it try glorifying the American army's endeavour in Vietnam. This is a 'real' story about soldiers who are plunged into a war they are not quite sure why they are fighting.<br/><br/>If you are the sort who likes 'real' war movies (not the Rambo kind), then this one is a 'must-see'. The best part I liked about this movie is the balance it maintains by showing the happenings on the battlefield as well as in the lives of their families back home(showing lesser known facts like the strange method of informing families about the death of their kin).<br/><br/>Brilliant performances from Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper and good performances in general from the rest of the cast."
"csmbbbwb","10","3","5","7 March 2002"," Very great flick on a scale of 100 it would have to be at least a 98 or maybe even a 99.4 a must see movie if you love a great story and great action and acting.

So the actors and makers of this film had to make sure they did a great job  in how they did their perspective parts  in the film and I feel they did a great job.<br/><br/>The movie is so well done I believe it could have a chance for  best picture in the next academy awards,and Mel Gibson should have a pretty good shot for best actor, and Sam Elliot should have a good shot for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>Anyways you want be wasting your time of money if you go see this great movie  a great story  with  great actors and actoress , a must see.

"bamacharm","10","3","5","7 March 2002"," Inspiring dramatization of a true story. A case study of great leadership.
","The movie centers around the events that transpired at la Drang Valley (""The Valley of Death"") in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam in 1965. The battle at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray was the first significant engagement between U.S. forces and North Vietnamese Regulars (NVA). Approximately 400 members of the 7th Regiment, 1st Calvary Division (Custer's Regiment) found themselves confronting 2000 highly motivated  NVA regulars who were battle hardened from the French-Indochina War. It was the early days of Air Cavalry when the helicopter assumed its troop carrying, combat role.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson played the role of LTC Hal Moore and Sam Elliot the role of his Sergeant Major. Both were magnificient. Gibson turns in another sterling performance worthy of an oscar. As a veteran, I was particularly impressed by Elliot's performance as a Sergeant Major. He captured the attitude and demeanor of the senior NCO perfectly. All of the performances were an outstanding and inspiring portrayal of courage and dedication to duty. Like the movie ""Gettysburg"", ""We Were Soldiers"" is a case study in leadership.<br/><br/>The film also focuses on the families of the men who fought there and the effects of war on those serving at the home front. Similarly, it focuses on the human side of the enemy and acknowledges their bravey and suffering as well. This film is a ""must see"" and will, no doubt, gather a great deal of attention at the Academy Awards."

""Wings"" was my first, about 1935. Next came Lew Ayers in ""All Is Quiet,"" in re-release. Somewhere in there I saw ""Birth Of a Nation.""<br/><br/>
Then we went into WWII, and Korea, and Viet Nam, then Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm, Somalia, Bosnia, and now Afghanistan. After all the wars and subsequent films, I can only say, ""We Were Soldiers,"" is the most brilliant, graphic, ghastly, realistic, ugliest piece of carnage ever put on film. Mel Gibson, cast, and crew reach a new level of excellence.<br/><br/>
This is an unforgettable film no matter how much you might want to put it behind you. As for me, I still trembled sitting through the credits."

A great reminder that the military should be allowed to do what it is paid to do.  The Country doesn't have to agree, but we do have to treat our soldiers with respect, they are doing what we have asked of them.

","WWS is the best movie I've seen since 1995. That was the year of 'Braveheart', 'Apollo 13', 'Seven', 'Murder in the First', 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Il Postino'. This is the first movie I've seen about Vietnam that honors our soldiers. After 'Coming Home', 'Born on the 4th of July', 'Platoon', 'Tigerland' and 'Apocolypse Now', it was very refreshing to see a movie that recognizes their sacrifices. We had no vested interest in Vietnam. That's why it was so tragic to lose American lives. That's why we lost the war, it wasn't ours to fight in the first place. They were soldiers, just like in WWI, WWII, Korea, the Gulf War, Somalia. I was touched and moved. I didn't get lost in the technological rhetoric, the scenery, the score. I got lost in the movie - which is why I go. I loved it. No need to analyze just to appreciate. Best $5.25 I've spent in years."

","I'm looking down at some of the reviews of We Were Soldiers and it seems to me like people are looking for something to p**s and moan about. This movie was excellent. Mel Gibson shows us that he can act in anyway on screen, his range is incredible, and truly be looked at as a war hero and not just the guy from Braveheart. The movie's score is PERFECT for the film, it handles the emotion very well, and the filming is very alternative. I liked it, and there is really not much that anyone can say is bad about it. 8/10."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","4","8","3 March 2010"," Explosive, both in action and characterisations.
","On Sunday November 14th, Lt. Col. Hal Moore {Mel Gibson} and his 400 strong regiment touched down at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley, Vietnam. Surrounded by around 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers who were well trained and well versed with the terrain, Moore's troopers fought for 56 hours. It was a bloody and brutal battle that was the first major engagement of the Vietnam War. It was ""The Valley Of Death"" in more ways than one.<br/><br/>Directed by Randall Wallace, We Were Soldiers is based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once√Ç‚Ä¶ And Young"" by Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway. As always when a War film comes out you get the usual statements trundled out. Things such as ""the most realistic yet"" and ""finally a film to tell it as it was,"" both of which were applied to Wallace's movie. If they happen to be true I have no idea, what with not being a combat veteran myself. What I do know is that personally, We Were Soldiers hits many many high points in its running time of 138 minutes.<br/><br/>After a crucial 30 minute build up of the characters, the film switches to the landing of the ""boys"" in Vietnam. From here the action never lets up, with Wallace and his team stunningly recreating the brutality and harshness of this bloody engagement. But crucially the action does not detract from its characters, having been engaged with them at the start of the film, the makers ensure that we stay with these men throughout the battle. Also of note is that the film shows the Vietnamese side of the battle, the fair treatment of both sides a most rewarding thing to see in a War film. There's brilliant cut aways to the Women and families at home, themselves fighting a battle to not lose their minds as their men fight in some faraway land. The emotional aspect significantly racked up high as the dreaded telegrams start being delivered by nameless, faceless yellow cab drivers.<br/><br/>The men of the cast are uniformly strong, particularly Gibson, Sam Elliott, Greg Kinnear, Barry Pepper & Ryan Hurst. While Madeleine Stowe & Keri Russell deliver heartfelt and believable turns on the Women's side. Dean Semler's cinematography is done justice by the new High Definition age and Nick Glennie-Smith's score is just a wonderful, emotive arrangement that taps into the psyche of the viewer. It's looking like it is a divisive film now, certainly in the context of Vietnam War films. So with that it is in danger of becoming the forgotten ""Nam"" movie. Which would be a crying shame for this is a tip top dramatisation of an horrific historical event. Point made, nobody forgotten, great great film. 8/10"

","The filming and acting were both good but the story and dialogue were both lacking... Yes I know that this is a true telling of events in the vietnam war, but it was boring! Not being a fan of war movies in general, I had high expectations for this film. Good cast, good trailers, and good subject matter, but all in all I was very disappointed. The message at the end was the best part, but I suggest you just watch the first 20 minutes and the last half...the middle is just typical war movie violence and shocking images. Oh well, I suggest you skip this one and rent Forest Gump if you want to see something about the vietnam war."

","I had high expectations of this Hollywood war epic, but it was obvious from the start that, having gone to war, Mel Gibson would be the only survivor in ""his street"" and every other soldier from the same street would die.<br/><br/>Typical Hollywood pap.<br/><br/>I originally gave this film 5 but I think I was too generous, and gave it 4, for this comment section.<br/><br/>The movie gives what it wants to give (or shall I say, all it's got to give), and that's loads of blood and gore, messy patriotic dialogue, and it's all very predicable. At no point did I feel any sympathy for any of the characters. That's not me being mean-hearted, it's just the film is so false, yet based on true events.<br/><br/>At 2 hours plus, it is far too long. This movie was dragged out like there's no tomorrow. It all could have been packaged better in 1 hour 35 minutes.<br/><br/>Yet still, it would be a ""B"" movie. Watch it on video; then you can whizz through the first 45 minutes of uninterrupted lengthy dialogue, and get to the action bits. That's if you like a constant hour of people being shot, bombed and the smell of death on the battle field.<br/><br/>Or, you could just forget it, and watch The Great Escape (1963)."
"xnoybis1","4","5","11","24 September 2005"," ho hum dorky Vietnam blech
","Randall Wallace made one fun movie that was blown out of proportion and pushed him into an ego happy land on par with Leonardo DiCaprio. Braveheart was popcorn munching heaven. Everything since then has been a steady drivel of nothing¬ólike coffee grounds forced, FORCED from the bottom of the pot to make an unwilling cuppa. This movie is bland on so many levels it's a shame. I think it was about 20 minutes into it when the helicopters that look like knock off plastic hueys on a blue screen do little aerials that I realized money here would have been better spent on advancing technology for turning ducks into toaster ovens. From there it just sort of goes down hill. Lessee... we've got the obligatory 5 seconds of screen time for the token black guy who just looks confused (seriously, do any of you know how MANY black people really fought in the Vietnam war? Jeepers), the obligatory shaky, gritty camera shots when the battle gets wicky wild; the reverb echo effects just before the big big oh no mortars fall; friendly fire; blood blood everywhere; grim face shots of our lead actor; young faces going into battle; battle screams¬ódang, we have a veritable A-list A-team here¬óand yet... this movie just kills itself. It's like Disney doing a porno¬óevery shot in between is crystal clear and filled with¬ó'we know not the evil we do' sentimentality. It's saccharine, it's silly, it's not worth your while. If you want a good war movie¬ógo for broke with Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line, or Dr. Strangelove. However, if you're in the market for lackluster string sections sound-tracking slow-motion montages of sucky images with poor poor poor poor adobe premiere flame effects... why, your cattle car stops here! Watch as Mel Gibson takes another lofty glance at that mountain over th'ar; see minority groups squabble and then make ends meet; witness Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson reconcile their bigotry in Braveheart (if you don't know what I'm talking about, then perhaps you should read more) by attempting rationalizations from the enemy perspective (gee, they're almost human!); C-class emotional drama... the list of daunting accomplishments goes on. 4 / 10 for this sludge fest. It gets 4 for actually accomplishing what I think it set out to do: show lot's of people being killed, make shallow stabs at moral messages, parade around with American imperialism, and make some money.<br/><br/>As an addendum (and quoting another post I made) Just because a film is about human tragedy (american and/or otherwise) doesn't mean we should exempt it from criticism on its (lack of) artistic merit as a film. Furthermore, why bother making a film that relies so heavily on its source material that it has fans raving, ""well you can't understand unless you've read the book, otherwise you'll never understand."" This is as idiotic as the faith defense. I shouldn't have to read the book! It's a movie! If I wanted to read the book, then I would have read the book!

","This was difficult to watch and made my heart ache.
I knew very little about the battles in Vietnam but this movie really opened my eyes to how unprepared our men were and how the politicians made them go into battle even with little training.
These soldiers bravely fought and gave it all they could with the limited resources they were given.
The actors do a great job of pulling you in. Even though you don't get to really know the characters in depth you feel for them as a whole.
There is a lot of fighting and a lot of blood shed, A LOT!!
It angers me to think how some people treated these boys when they came home.
When other critics say it's a gung ho, GO AMERICA war movie full of propaganda and that it shows America hitting targets and Vietnam not , they must have watched a different movie. In my opinion the movie presented both sides, but of course it's going to show the American side more, it's based on the events from an American who was in that first battle.
The ending was beautifully done, showing how both sides feel pain for their dead brothers and family members. How these men who came home, came back to no celebrations, no parades... just reminders of what they endured. So different from previous wars.
The only reason I took a star off is because the battle scenes can get chaotic, which is even more realistic but sometimes hard to follow.
The musical score was also well done, as was the 1960's set and costume details .<br/><br/>""They went to war because their country ordered them to, but In the end they fought not for their country or their flag, they fought for each other """

","I loved this movie so much, that I watched it 5 times in 2 days.<br/><br/>I loved this movie for so many different reasons. It was gripping, real, emotionally hard from start to finish. 
The first 30 minutes, you learn about the characters & their families. 
You learn the true emotional struggles they & their families faced both before, during and after. 
What I personally found hard was that you fall for some of the characters only to find many of them killed in battle. Obviously many babies were born to soldiers who never get to know them or watch them grow up.<br/><br/>My favourite scene would have to be, (without a doubt) the final farewell party where two of the soldiers mimed along to two songs. Greg Kinnear mimed the first song.
 
The second song -
""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"" Song by Mel Carter was the most beautiful, sexy but one of the saddest, because the soldiers & their wives were all lovingly kissing, caressing & saying goodbye to each other prior to the Soldiers leaving for the battle. All of them knowing that this could be the last night & time they ever see each other again. 
Sadly, for many it was... broke my heart! <br/><br/>HELP PLEASE!!
If anyone can help identify a particular soldier/actor for me, I'd be very grateful. 
It was the soldier miming to THAT ROMANTIC song - Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"".

We were soldiers covers the first , and one of the biggest battles of the entire Vietnam War. It captures the hearts and minds of the viewer, and really gives the audience a sense of what war/jungle fighting would really be like. It shows not just the war, but the struggle of the families at home in the States, who after all , were just as emotionally involved. It shows patriotism, love, loyalty, courage and spirit through a lot of the main characters, and the battle scenes are truly terrific.

"Samiam3","8","2","3","19 June 2017"," A violent but well executed 'nam pic.
","""I will be the first to set foot on the filed, and I will be the last to step off, and I will leave no man behind."" So declares Lt. Hal Moore played by Mel Gibson the day before he and his outfit set off across the Pacific for the front lines of Vietnam. Easily the highlight line of the movie, it would be easy enough to see this as the kind of cheesy bravado that romanticizes war heroes, but We Were Soldiers gets away with it by being everything but romantic. There are moments where the images of blood alone may be enough to summon misty eyes.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but it is a visually genuine and visceral depiction of battle and survival. The American invasion of Communist Vietnam is something that to this day, virtually nobody is proud of so. All the better it is that the film has no political bias or stance on the conflict. It even does something to the contrary. The Vietcong ""charlie"" are not bad guys, they are merely soldiers fighting for their homeland.<br/><br/>The firefighting is quite exhausting but it is the individual moments in-between the bullets that lift We Were Soldiers out of the chaos. Director Randall Wallace adds a curious scoring touch laying ""Sgt. Mackenzie."" (a Scottish WWI ballad), over the first moments of the final assault.<br/><br/>The irony is that this is a song about the will to die for country; not a compatible motif with 'nam,Regardless of its political correctness, the words end up being less important than the somber and haunting tone of the melody. Our characters are not fighting for country, they are fighting for each other, and to get home to their loved ones. <br/><br/>Every now and then, Wallace cuts from the front lines back to America to focus on Moore's Wife and the wives of his comrades. Day to day they live in fear of receiving a certain letter from the government regarding their husbands. The impact of these scenes on the picture is rather minimal, but it serves to remind us of what is really at stake, while showcasing one of Madaline Stowe's better performances. She barely has to say a word, you can read the vulnerability in her eyes.<br/><br/>True to his word, Hal Moore is the first to step off the field, and there is a good shot of his boot coming of the grass and into the chopper that will take him back to the home of the brave. The final sequences are heavy on unspoken melodrama, over emphasizing the loss of life. The film doesn't rely on our knowledge of the history to add to the tragedy. It is a story about brothers and comrades who fought together and died together."

","great acting, based on a true story, no nonsense straight to the point and lots of action. Mel Gibson plays real life war hero Col.Moore in the war against Vietnam and it displays one major battle. The real time movie is about 3 days total. The combat is very graphical and about as close to feeling real as movie can get, which is quite good. The acting is sincere especially by Gibson and his character looked just as heroic as his real life character who in reality has about 20 war medals. My favorite scene is Gibson showing his acting chops at the end and saying ""why did my men have to die, and im still alive""? Spoken like a true hero, go watch this especially if your a military member or history junkie. In my opinion, it's better than black hawk down, just because the elements are more accurate to certain events."
"fredericksmith1952","10","2","3","23 January 2012"," The Finest combat film ever.
","Fair warning. If you are the least bit squeamish about combat scenes, pass on this film. This contains some of the most graphic and realistic scenes since the beach landing in Saving Private Ryan. Once the fighting starts, it is non-stop and horrific, and anyone who thinks combat is in any way glorious or heroic will walk away with an altered attitude. The portrayals are realistic and true, thanks to the technical advise of both the authors, and the performances are human and identifiable. Young men who are thrown into combat, young wives and families who are horrified to learn their husbands and fathers are gone. The ""illusion of the first time"" is perfect, and from the very beginning you are drawn into the story as if you are observing it unfold. Both Stowe and Gibson give Oscar worthy performances, as does Elliot and the rest of the cast. This is one for your collection, and definitely a film any young man with dreams of being a combat hero ought to see before heading to the enlistment office. It should be obvious this is not a film for the children in the family, but teens above the age of 14 ought to be able to watch without nightmares."

The film is only just over 2 hours, but i had to go out to do some shopping, in between the ironing and pause it whenever my daughter entered the room (not advisable for U18's). After the first 10 min, it had me hooked, and did not let go until the credits started rolling! Non biased, tried to tell it from both sides about the capture of a specific landmark. Absolutely not a bad accompaniment to the dreaded ironing chore. Now i am supposed to make up 10 lines to complete this review so here goes the filler. Mel is an utterly believable soldier as is his wife. Credit the cast and direction, I have watched many a film where i remember during the film that these are just acting, and this is just pretend.

"Keith_99","8","2","3","16 March 2011"," We Were Soldiers
","We Were Soldiers is an action pack movie that is a little different from most war movies. Instead of focusing on just the battles surrounding two ermines of different countries, We Were Soldiers focus on all aspect of the war. The main theme concentrates on the toll that war takes on not only the solders of both sides, but also the families the solders are attached to. The movie describes the first major battle of the Vietnam War and how it affected the soldiers and their families.<br/><br/>Lt. Col. Hal Moore is call up to take charge of a new plan developed by the United States. This new plan will allow troops to be flown in and out of battle quickly by helicopters. Lt. Moore embraces this challenge and trains his men hard so they will be prepared for battle. Once training was finished, the men headed to a battle zone that was called The Valley of Death. This battle became the first major battle in a war known as the Vietnam War. The movie concentrates not on just the battle itself, but how the soldiers and their families were affected by war. The fighting scenes focus on how the solders on both side felts as fierce fighting was going on with each other. At times they were brave and other time they became scared to death. While this intense battle is going on, the wife's back on the home front are also taking a beating by hearing about the death of their husbands. At this time Julie Moore (Lt. Moore wife) takes charge in contacting the other wife's once their husbands have been killed. Julie Moore stays strong throughout the whole time and kept the other wife's together and helps them with their problems.<br/><br/>Lt. Moore and his men are out number five to one by the Vietnam solders, so they are hanging on to their lines by a thread. Maj. Bruce Crandall is one of the helicopter pilots who put his own life at risk in order to help the solders on the ground survive. Maj. Crandall provides courage for the other pilots as they continue to bring in supply and more solders. Without the support of these pilots, the ground troops would not have survived.<br/><br/>The movie special sound affect and lighting enhances the overall quality of this film. The fighting scenes produce bullets flying by and explosions in the back ground that gives you a feeling as being part of the movie. Scenes where the solders are laying in pitch darkness give you a feeling of uncertainty just as the solders would feel.<br/><br/>Over all I believe We Were Solders is an excellent movie that just does not detail the issues of war, but it demonstrates all effect of war and the people it hurts. Other movies such as Rambo mainly isolates on the action packed fighting scenes and does not give much detail on anything else. We Were Solders show how much courage the solders of both side gave in order to make their countries proud. At the end of this historic battle, both sides realize the death and destruction this war is going to cause."
"drystyx","7","2","3","11 January 2010"," Well done battle film
","I am not a Gibson fan. He often appears in contrived plots and trite themes, but he is one of the best actors of this age. Here, he gives a superior performance, which, of course, also means the other actors also gave superior performances, and the direction and editing was superb.<br/><br/>The story is about a battle at the beginning of U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. The story is nonjudgmental, and goes out of its way to be neutral. It is obviously anti-war, and depicts higher ups in a poor light, but the poor light is justified by being accurate, and well depicted in a way we can understand.<br/><br/>It is a different style of war film. It has elements of the old war film, in which we see some camaraderie among soldiers in an isolated situation, along with the families at home who wait for news, and it has elements of the new war film, in which we see some of the politics involved in decisions higher up.<br/><br/>It is high in action, and not many dull moments. We begin with the introduction of characters, the training, and the family lives of the soldiers, then we get into high gear with combat, and the combat is brutal. One officer leads his men into an ill advised chase of an enemy scout to capture him (his men must've been wondering why they couldn't have been told to shoot the enemy in the leg to capture him) and get cut off.<br/><br/>We really see most characters come and go, but the film does follow 5 Americans in battle pretty well, one of them who does leave this world. One of the five is a reporter who makes the film a little weaker. By any definition, he is a moron, going into the heat of battle with no adequate explanation, except for his inner feeling of superiority. Without this character, the film could've ranked a 10 instead of a 9. But if he was there, he was there.<br/><br/>Well done war film that takes no sides."
"barbb1953","9","2","3","6 October 2009"," Excellent movie but the ending spoils it a bit
","Be warned that the third paragraph will contain a very big spoiler as I discuss the ending. Meanwhile, there is a lot to praise in this movie. In particular, Sam Elliott's performance is superb, and he is given one of the most succinct summations of the reality of war I've ever seen, this in the ongoing business where the officer wishes him a good day and gets a foul chewing-out in return, and then later on Elliott explains to him on the battlefield what a real good day is for a soldier and the officer reacts. Also excellent is the realism of this movie; it makes you appreciate what all those pilots and grunts went through during that time. Also, the scenes from the Communist perspective are short but illuminating, and the drum soundtrack gives them additional power. There was no way the Americans could know who the enemy leader was at the time, but later on they did meet and talk with Nguyen Huu An. His role in all this is very well done. Please note: Vietnamese wearing a coolie hat and black pajamas are VC; those wearing a uniform--and this applies to the young soldier who charges Col. Moore, too--are member of the North Vietnamese Army. Finally, extra depth is given to the movie by showing the wives coping with it, too; I just marvel at Mrs. Moore and her friend: how could they do that? Love, of course; just like their men, they are taking care of their own.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good movie. Now that somebody has portrayed the first contact between North Vietnamese and American foot soldiers, I hope somebody will come out with the first armor contact between the two armies, at Ben Het in 1969. That would be interesting, too. (Next paragraph contains the spoiler.) <br/><br/>Now, the criticism. It's really too bad that Gibson gave in to his desire to ""hero"" it up with that fictitious bayonet charge at the end. What the cavalrymen actually did there was heroic enough, and there really wasn't any need, apart perhaps from ego, to add in anything extra. In fact, it's the one thing our war in Vietnam never had--there was all this WWII-style carnage, but then the survivors were just transferred out; there was rarely this soul-satisfying win (or loss). From what I've read of the November fight in the Ia Drang in 1965, it was about as close to a traditional win as we got during those year, but that happened without the charge. This ending definitely subtracted from the overall credibility found in the rest of the film."

","This movie is the most realistic war movie that I've ever seen. If you're a vet you'll relate to many of the scenes portrayed in this movie. Not necessarily just the battle footage. Many instances of deja vu were generated in me while watching this movie. (Even though I'm not a Nam veteran.) It's got that ""feeling"". Non vets won't have a clue as to what I'm referring to; they haven't been there. This movie will make you both laugh and cry in about equal doses. Mr.Gibson has done an outstanding job of portraying a horrific battle in an unpopular war. Seldom does a movie portray the camaraderie that develops between men in military units that transcends both family and friends as does this one. I don't care about how many war pictures you readers have seen, this one will get and hold your attention right from the ""get go"". I've never seen our (and their) soldiers portrayed more nobly. It's too bad the same can't be said for the people that get us into these situations."

","I sat down to see this expecting something similar to FMJ or Born on the Fourth of July. What I got was a compelling and truthful portrait of the opening stages of the US involvement in the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>The film was a tour de force of what families go through while their men are away and what those men themselves experience during war. Something as an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, I can all too readily relate to.<br/><br/>Perhaps it skirted, if not clich√©, then sentimentalism at times and lacked the blacker than black humour that most soldiers possess. However the film remains an excellent portrayal at a keypoint in modern US history and a fitting testament to those who, if they weren't motivated by the patriotism Hollywood would have us believe, were certainly motivated to be there for their friends.<br/><br/>If there is one major disappointment in the film, it's the total lack of mention of then Lt. Rick Rescorla, a legend in the 7th Cav, a hero who sadly gave his life on 9/11 and the soldier made famous by the Life magazine photo that adorns the cover of most published versions of We Were Soldiers Once and Young.<br/><br/>He was, of course, one among many whose stories were not told, but it seems a shame that so iconic a figure from the battle of Ia Drang is totally absent and leaves Gibson and Wallace open once again to accusations of Anglophobia."
"cmeeker","10","2","3","23 January 2008"," A Film Worth Watching
","This film surprised me because I did not realize it was about the very beginning of our involvement in Vietnam, and it begins with the French being massacred in 1954. We move up in time to 1964 and 1965. Barry Pepper is particularly memorable as a non-combat soldier carrying a camera, taking photographs. It's beautiful to see the black & white shots he's taken in contrast to the fighting behind him in color. The scene with him at the end talking to Mel Gibson is moving and realistic. Gibson's eyes fill with tears because he feels he should have died having lost so many men, and he asks Pepper to write about what happened here in this valley, the la Drang Valley, The Valley of Death.<br/><br/>Another lovely quality to this film is showing the Vietnamese side of the battle, and their Commander making decisions. We see a dead Vietnamese soldier's diary showing a photograph of his wife and pages written in Vietnamese. This is a thoughtful remembrance for all the men who died in Vietnam, not just French and Americans.<br/><br/>This has star quality all over it. The music is uneven sometimes, and I feel it could have been a 10 star film had a stronger musical score been developed. However there's plenty of pathos, sad and terrible battle scenes, and the painful delivery of letters to the wives of dead soldiers back in the States. Definitely a film worth watching."

","The United States of America lost 58,000 lives in Vietnam.I don't know even a Ball Park figure for the number of Vietnamese killed.It is at the very least arguable whether the Americans were defending freedom or satisfying the ambitions and ego of Kennedy,Johnson and Nixon.The ""Domino Theory"" was very much in vogue at the time,this has since been proved to be not quite right - rather like ""Flat Earth"". One of the few things Harold Wilson is remembered fondly for is his refusal to commit British troops to this war of attrition where,basically,over a period of ten years from the events depicted in ""We were soldiers"" America's political will to fight was ground down and 58,000 of their fighting men died,ultimately,for nothing.God knows the military flesh was willing but the political spirit was weak,so to speak.I have nothing but respect for the brave Americans who fought the war both on the ground and ,afterwards, back home,excoriated by many for being sent against their will to be cannon-fodder in a foreign country for a cause that many were - to put it mildly - doubtful about. As a Brit with no axe to grind -and well aware that,along with the Russians,the Americans saved our arses in WW2 - I watched this movie with an open mind.I wouldn't presume to argue with the Vietnam vets who found it an accurate account of events,they were there,I wasn't. As a movie,per se,judged purely on those terms,it is a mixture of the harrowing and the clich√©d.Sam Elliot's redoubtable Sergeant Major echoes back to Nigel Green in ""Zulu"" and many another gruff but caring noncom in movieland.Presumably there were such guys in real life,certainly if I were a grunt I'd feel much better having one around.Mel Gibson's Col Moore certainly puts himself in harm's way for most of the duration, a charismatic leader and a man of courage.Clearly the message here is the Americans were not lions led by donkeys. The NVA is treated with more respect than usual,as befits an organisation that out-thought if not out-fought a Superpower. I found the ending where the NVA leader replaced the tattered American flag slightly strained my credibility but maybe it happened.As Jonathan Miller said in ""Beyond the Fringe""...""Funny thing,war"". There is very little fresh that Hollywood can concoct in the ""War Movie"" genre beyond increased technical advances in sound and special effects to increase its reality factor,but until you actually have to dodge the bullets the cinema is never going to produce an ""authentic"" film. War is hell,soldiers die horribly,it's noisy,terrifying and very,very dangerous.Sitting in our air-conditioned,popcorn-crunching safety we have absolutely no idea of what it's really like. ""We were soldiers"" deserves respect for not sinking into the cigar- chomping foul-mouthed sneering G.I.mould .Whether it accurately depicts the event it concerns only those who were there are qualified to say."

","I didn't see this movie when it was released. I felt, after seeing Braveheart, that what I was going to see was a pro-Vietnam War movie, like what John Wayne did in The Green Berets. I was wrong, and I wish I'd seen this in the movie theater. I saw it tonite on TV, Memorial Day Weekend, with so many other war movies on so many channels. I felt it gave an accurate, realistic portrayal of that war, both pro and con. The cinematography was very effective, showing the confusion and chaos of a battle scene, pulling the audience into the battle. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot and Barry Pepper were very good, and Greg Kinnear was surprisingly good. The attention to detail was excellent, and graphic. I don't know what this movie is rated, and since I saw it on TV, I'm sure much of it was cut, but the violence is very effective. Just as an example, when they show the first American death, and the camera is focused on the soldier's eyes, as he dies you see his pupils dilate. I'm sure, as a nurse, I noticed a lot of this sort of detail that maybe gets missed, but it certainly adds to the reality of the movie. I intend to rent this so I can see it uncut, and I'm going to buy the book. I'm sure the movie couldn't include everything, but what was there is excellent."

","Just had to comment on the previous write up. This is an excellent film however the ending differs greatly from the book which was written by the American journalist Joe Galloway who was there on the ground throughout the battle. In true movie-world tradition the ending was changed to show the Americans winning when in fact they were bailed out by other American troops who were also then attacked and took seriously heavy casualties. Why can't films based on the truth keep to the truth?<br/><br/>As to the film itself it covers the historical changing of the American army from World War 2 equipment and tactics to the new M16 and helicopter based infantry. Covering the first major battle of the American involvement in the Vietnam war it shows the guts and horror of close quarter battle in overwhelming circumstances. To the films credit it also covers the difficulty of the wives left at home being notified of the deaths of friends and loved ones by telegram."

","I salute the actors, and directors of this movie for having the courage to depict the harsh realities of war without ""romanticising"" it. With all the negative sentiment surrounding Vietnam it is admirable this movie can be objective enough to show the soldiers on both sides as people with family who care about them. Even though I served there and detested the terrorist, aggressive actions of the communist north I have always known the enemy were people. They were someones sons and daughters. This movie shows in some respects how war affects the many who do not serve. If all people of the world felt as I do now, there would be no more wars. Unfortunately such is not the case. Sam Elliot is excellent as the hard nosed old Sergeant who has seen too much war in his lifetime but is not about to give up fighting the good fight.

","the Vietnam War is one of those least understood in my home country of UK I think. This film will not assist us to greater understanding of the politics but you will not come away from watching it without a greater understanding of the men who fought it. When I first knew of its release I viewed Mel Gibson's employment as nothing but a ploy to rake in viewer's, fearing he would be a little john wayne-ish in the part of Hal Moore. I actually feel this is his finest performance to date. Films like platoon, hamburger hill and the boys from company c all have their own merits, whereas maybe green berets lacks any at all. We were soldiers stands head and shoulders above any of them in its representation of combat, its brutality, the comradeship it brings about and the effects upon those back home. I am not known for my moist eyes during films but I certainly felt myself weep for those wives left behind and what they had to endure. Hal Moore was a superb combat leader, of that there can be no doubt. This film is a fitting and excellent testimonial to them and all the boys who went there for reasons they little understood"
"Rich B","7","2","3","20 March 2005"," A harrowing, realistic war movie with intelligence, but peppered with bad edits
","Much was talked about this movie when it first came out, with the obvious comparisons made to Mel Gibson's other historical epic Braveheart, and those made me steer clear of the movie for a good while, although now I find myself wondering why after seeing it this weekend.<br/><br/>It rivals Saving Private Ryan for the realism and gore factor, bringing the devastation and personal pain involved in war right at you without flinching.<br/><br/>Gibson is strong in this role, but plays it at quite a lower key than he did in Braveheart, and it works really well. He really is a great actor, sure you can question some of his decisions and roles, but he can really pull off an emotional scene at both ends of the spectrum, and he has to show them all.<br/><br/>The film certainly shows how harrowing the first assault of the Vietnam war really was, and how utterly pointless it was. It was amazing to see the courage and strength of the young men involved, and then being shown the flip side with the cowardice and idiocy of the suits in charge and their disregard for the lives of the soldiers.<br/><br/>Although the movie concentrates on the US Soldiers it does turn to the Vietnamese Commander and show the similarities between them and their belief and love for their soldiers.<br/><br/>Something that strikes me about many of the US historical movies is their blatant disregard for history, and their total belief in the American way above all else. The US won World War II by themselves, they managed to break the hold of the German Submarines by finding and cracking their code machine and they leapt into action and poured destruction on the Japanese after Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>None of this is seen in this movie, yes there is a strong American belief, but in this movie it's much more real. The belief is there, but it's from the soldiers who really believe in their Country and what they are fighting for, a feeling that was present in the real world before this war, and has struggled through since.<br/><br/>It is a great war movie, it's also a very moving and harrowing one, showing what the Soldiers went through for their country and how their officials, and indeed their people, failed them.<br/><br/>However it's not all good. The movie seems to have many swift cuts which are suited to the battle scenes, but not in transitions, and it begins to have the feel that there are portions of the movie edited out. This is certainly backed in the continuity of the story and how some crucial background and key scenes just seem to be raced through giving you the barest of information before heading off to another battle.<br/><br/>That really harms the movie for me, and it's a shame because there is so much of this movie which is really, really good."

The effort spent on authenticity was amazing. I would certainly have liked to have seen more of the Vietnamese in the movie, but at least they made the attempt. One interesting thing to note is that if you get this film on DVD, definitely watch the deleted scenes, in particular the debriefing of Col. Moore by Gen. Westmoreland and Secretary McNamara, where they are trying to use the victory he and his men gained at Ia Drang to justify their policies in Vietnam. Very interesting, particularly Col. Moore's reaction to them."

","This is a film everyone should see prior to voting in the 2004 general election. It depicts truly what our soldiers experienced in Vietnam. Every actor does a superb job of bringing home the reality of what the Vietnam War was really about, and how every one of these men is deserving of our respect and gratitude. I suspect the making of this film is part of the process which brought Mel Gibson back to his faith in God. This movie is not for children, but every young adult in America should see it to understand more about what their fathers went through in Vietnam. There is graphic violence which is necessary to understand the horrid violence which is war. At the end of the film you may not have dry eyes but you will have a new or renewed respect for the courageous men who served in Vietnam."

It is a wonderful story of both the actual first American battle of the Vietnam war and the soldiers who fought it.

","This film, while not the best war movie ever, is definitely one of the better ones, far better than Platoon (the worst film ever made), Apocalypse Now (ugh), Full Metal Jacket (another stinker), etc. This film depicts the men as they really were: tough, compassionate, caring, valiant, and brave. Granted, maybe there were a few men like the ones in Platoon, but if so, they were an extremely small (almost microscopic) minority. This film has a great cast, a good script (although too much artistic licensing went into it), sympathetic characters, incredible combat sequences, and is almost 100% historically accurate. It's a true masterpiece (which would make it the opposite of the God-awful monstrosity Platoon). Not one of the top 10 movies ever, but probably one of the top 50 (in my opinion). I'd give it a 9 out of 10."

The director created a masterpiece that overtakes perhaps ""Platoon"". The music was very fine and melancholy. Great special effects and top picture.

","I find that people describing Mel Gibson as the ""hero"" in this one, in the mold of John Wayne is just wrong. This movie in my eyes had no heroes and it made me sick to the stomach, which I haven't felt in a long long time. Both sides are depicted as men fighting in a war that in itself only meant something to one side, the Vietnamese, but where everyone fights because they have to, to survive. In a normal warmovie, say Germany vs. US in WWII, we don't see the face of the enemy, but only the Hurrah!!! Brave, Brave American soldierrrrr. This movie shows that both sides in a war have families, and that they are all human. Wars are fought because ""clever men"" covet one thing or another, be it land, oil or in a current case to get a war named after him because someone stole his fathers thunder.<br/><br/>I have just watched this movie, and am now going home to meditate to rid my mind of the gore which seemed all to realistic to me.

","I have read a lot of the other comments posted here and I have come to the conclusion that some of you people just don't get it. This was based on a book written by Col. Harold Moore. The dialogue, although not word for word, cannot be called cliche because these are the types of things that the colonel and others heard during the war. If you are sitting there dying in your buddy's arms, then what pray tell would say?? I think that we all would want our wives to know that they were the last person on our minds and that we felt that our last words should be, ""Tell my wife that I love her.""<br/><br/>The movie wasn't made to break any new artistic ground, it was made to accurately portray the lives of a generation of soldiers that have either been vilified by Hollywood or worse yet, ignored. Col. Moore has said that he liked the way that the movie has turned out and quite frankly that's the most important opinion to me. To hell with your cliches, that's what went down.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that this was quite possibly the best war movie that I have ever seen. I came into this movie thinking that the scenes with the families would bring down the movie but I have to say that the film makers balanced these parts perfectly with the action sequences. Just a tremendous movie that really makes you proud of the true heroes of the sixties, the American Soldier."

"kobus21","10","2","3","28 June 2002"," Makes The Thin red line looks like Dad's Army
","I think the first thing I would like to point is that Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace is most definitly the best team since Don Simpson (R.I.P) and Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>This is most likely the most emotionally driven movie that I have EVER seen in my life.  I am a 23 year old male and I bawled like a little 4 month old baby walking out of the theater. Okay, call me old fashioned but the tribute to the soldiers who died in that battle which is displayed during the beginning of the end credits was probably the best and most emotionally charged experience I have ever had. <br/><br/>I think that this proves ones again that Mel Gibson is absolutely the best actor ever to walk on the face of this planet.  Hell, if you doubt me do yourself a favor, rent Ransom, Braveheart and The Patriot before you se this movie and this will prove once again my point about his ability to bring a character to life on screen and that his portrayal of Hal Moore is not just a once of thing.  Oh yeah, do not forget the unforgettable Lethal Weapon Quartet. <br/><br/>My upmost congratulations to the Cast and the Producers of this film.  You have created a masterpiece that will go down in history with same bang and admiration such as Platoon, Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan (my hats of to Spielberg by the way)<br/><br/>One thing that bothers me a little is the whole casting of Chris 'Rollerball' Klein.  Don't get me wrong, he is a very good actor and I like him a lot (SPOILER ALERT!!) and for the little while he appeared in the film he portrayed his character exceptionally good but I do not think he is action hero material.  In my opinion he is to soft a person and to well spoken and personally I think he would do better by sticking to the Romantic Comedy Genre.  <br/><br/>All and all this film would get a very realistic 12/10 and if you like your war movies make sure that you see this on the big screen.  VHS or DVD just wouldn't do it any justice."

","I found this movie to be one of the best movies i have seen even, and clearly one of the best war movies of all time.  Whether or not the press agrees with me, this movie really gripped at the right issues surrounding the Vietnam War, both in the battlefield and on the home front.  It confronted the emotions and fears that soldiers and their families have regardless of where the war is and where they are living.  Some tremendous acting.  I am usually very critical of movies, and I am not afraid to really tear up a movie I didn't like.  I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie.  It is obviously not for all audiences, as it is war and it has some extremely realistic (but not disgustingly graphic) war scenes."
"Spiteall","10","2","3","3 June 2002"," Outstanding
","Having watched all those other movies that people try to compare it to, I believe is grossly unfair. Saving Private Ryan is not what I would call a classical war movie (except for the end). This is a great example of what battle looks like and the directors did a great job in portraying a BATTLE not a political agenda. This has to be among one of the top 5 war movies I've ever seen. It isn't about 1.5 hours of training and 45 minutes of war (such as Full Metal Jacket) or a platoon running around looking for something to do (Platoon) or a Ranger Squad looking for one guy (Saving Private Ryan). This is a GREAT film about the grotesque consequences of war with the inept intervention of politicians and congressmen. Great film, with round characters and great story line. Then again, why does the storyline matter, it really happened this way, why change the events that man had to go through for a ""better"" film. And it seems that the only reason Europeans didn't like this movie as much as Saving Private Ryan is probably because it doesn't have the U.S saving Europe from tyrannical idiots, again! Watch this movie if at all possible, great flick."
"Rmcfg","10","2","3","24 May 2002"," Like Home Movies ...
","I grew up in the 1960s in the Fort Benning area where this movie was actually filmed.  As a former Army Brat and as a career Army officer, I must salute the director for the attention to detail in bringing Hal Moore's story to the silver screen.<br/><br/>The uniforms of that era were exact ... right down to specific items of the soldier's uniforms such as camouflage covers and canvas field gear  which are now obsolete and getting harder to find.<br/><br/>It was like home movies for me to see a film featuring base houses in a section known as ""Colonel's Row"" where I once knew people that actually lived there; in addition to other scenery from my childhhood in Georgia. Many of my childhood friends had Dads assigned to the 11th Air Assault which was renamed the 7th Cavalry.<br/><br/>The one event that actually occurred and was omitted from the movie was the massive fly-over that took place prior to that unit's departure.  Many of the men assigned to that unit lived in houses just outside of Ft Benning. One afternoon prior to their departure, there was a massive fly-over where the skys over those suburban neighborhoods were black with army helicopters from Ft Benning.  For some of those soldiers it would be the last time that they would see their own homes from an aerial perspective.<br/><br/>The emotion shown of having the news of a soldier's death being delivered to his widow by a taxi driver was deeply realistic.  My own father had been killed in Viet Nam in 1964, one year prior to Hal Moore and his outfit being sent forward.  I remember when a cab driver pulled into our driveway with a telegram and my mother going ballistic!  She called the base, asked to speak to the 2-star general and totally chewed him out for being so cold hearted.<br/><br/>
Overall I think this was an excellent movie.  It not only focused upon the battle, but also had a focus upon the military families that too often has been overlooked by Hollywood."

","I was surprised when I viewed We Were Soldiers.  I went in expecting a flag-waving, purely American epic like Randall Wallace's previous film, Pearl Harbor.  This was not the case.  Wallace's screenplay and direction show the emotion and determination of both the American troops and the Vietnamese.  These men on both sides believed in what they were fighting for.  I also liked the character development in the first third of the film. By getting to know these characters in their personal lives we as the audience feel for them on the battlefield.  This movie, unlike other recent war films such as Black Hawk Down, gives the audience characters that they actually care about.  Although the action was not as horrific and fast-paced as other recent films in this genre, We Were Soldiers compensates by giving us a real story with real characters.  This film is the best Vietnam war movie since Platoon, the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and the best movie so far in 2002."

"steve4laws","Null","2","3","15 April 2002"," Understand Before You Criticize
","I'm amazed at how so many people who obviously consider themselves liberal and open minded are criticizing We Were Soldiers--a movie that really let's the viewer walk in another's shoes (pardon the cliche) . . .<br/><br/>
We Were Soldiers conjures emotions and memories strong enough to build fifty thousand reviews.  From experience and fist hand accounts, We Were Soldiers accurately depicts life on base and on the front.   For those of us too young to have fought, but old enough to remember, powerful and painful images persist.  Be ready to relive pain.<br/><br/>Sometimes my dad still pulls out the picture of his flight class, and calls the names of the men who died in the war as if asking them to suddenly appear.  I dare any of you who criticize the vets or the nation that fought that war to ask a vet to pull out his class picture and show you the men who died.<br/><br/>I hope one day you'll shake with their fear.  I hope one day you'll appreciate their sacrifice for your arrogance, and realize that without the US the ""Lingue France"" of Paris would be Russian.  Do you not realize that the Killing Fields of Cambodia were a direct result of the world's unwillingness to confront communism?  Such arrogant ignorance once cost the world millions of lives (see, for example, Why Communism Kills by Schwartz) and such ignorant criticism will cost the world millions more one day.<br/><br/>
War is an ugly thing--uglier still is the man who criticizes his defenders; the selfish, cowardly man-child who has no cause greater than himself.  If there's nothing you'll die for, you may surely one day die for nothing.<br/><br/>I remember little from my young days living on Air Force bases in the early 1970s.  I do remember wondering when my dad would come home.  I do remember ""those cars"" with an officer and a priest (I remember specifically that my mom couldn't look at them), and I do remember some kids not coming to class anymore.  I thank God I didn't know what those cars were for, and for not understanding why my friend Jimmy suddenly left the base.<br/><br/>
As for cliches, perhaps lines are used in so many war movies because they are really used--there are only so many ways to express the horror and pain of suddenly loosing a friend, or realizing you're about to die.  What will you miss my liberal friends?  Your dolphin?<br/><br/>Ask any soldier--every unit has at least one nut just like the ""I am proud to die for my country"" idiot.  And, as that child on a military base, I can recall asking my dad what a war was.  Although I think like many of you that the laundry reference was shallow and could have been done much better, it did serve to illustrate how racism largely died in the military long ago. It is amazing to me how liberal civilians have succeeded in keeping it around so long.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers demonstrates Vietnam in a new and refreshing way--soldiers were not butchers of civilians or drug-addicts.  They were human.  They had ideals.  They feared.  They were heros.  Many still fight that war, and this movie (and review) is for them."

A+ ****** (out of ****** stars) 13/13"
"slimjack","8","2","3","29 March 2002"," An old-fashioned war movie with all the strengths and failings of the genre.
","We Were Soldiers is based on the true story of the first major battle between American units and the North Vietnamese army. Mel Gibson plays Col. Hal Moore, the man tasked with leading the 7th Air Cavalry. This was the first battalion created to implement the new helicopter strategy that would become the signature of the war. These tactics are still in use today, as witness by Black Hawk Down for instance. The movie was written and directed by Randall Wallace. While not as stylish as some directors he tells his story simply and coherently. Wallace includes some unique touches.  We actually meet the North Vietnamese and while we don't really get to know him or his men, at least we get some sense of them as soldiers.<br/><br/>Wallace does make some mistakes.  The soldier's wives somehow don't come across.  Part of the problem is their costuming.  Their hairstyles and clothing are too-too early sixties. They look like east village drag queens having a retro party rather than concerned army wives. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore. Stowe is a fine actress but something weird happens with her character. For some reason, just as the character should become more vivid she begins to fade. I don't think this is Stowe's fault. I tend to think Wallace was more interested in the battles than he was in the home front and the soldier's wives suffered for it.<br/><br/>In the end, one's feelings about We Were Soldiers is defined by how one feels about Hollywood war movies.  Because it is a star driven film we have the pleasure of a great Gibson performance and Elliot's Sergeant Plumley. We pretty much know who's going to die and how.  The conventions help us make sense of a difficult battle that is presented very close to the way it actually happened. The downside to this is that, as close to the facts as the move is, it doesn't feel all that real. You experience it as a smart, thoughtful action movie instead of getting the sense of intense horrifying reality that you got from Black Hawk Down. If you're bothered by the idea of war as entertainment, you will have some trouble with We Were Soldiers. As for me, I enjoyed it and give it a hearty recommendation"
"whozat","10","2","3","24 March 2002"," One of the best
","I was a young helicopter pilot in Vietnam, and this movie is the first Vietnam movie I've seen that's not leftist anti-vet propaganda, with an overdose of whining soldiers and crazed officers. Instead, it turned out to be the best war movie I've seen, for at least two reasons: (1) it's a rare factual account (like Patton) - the events and people are real, and therefore are far more compelling than any imaginary story could ever be, and (2) the movie's realism - it accurately depicts what it was like to be a soldier and a helicopter pilot in battle in Vietnam, complete with having to put up with some of the cowards in the rear who never got their uniforms dirty.  I can't find the words to respond to those who obviously never flew over or fought in Vietnam who claim to know the vegetation and scenery well enough to be critical of the movie in that regard.<br/><br/>No movie can ever possibly recreate in a viewer the true intensity of the fear of taking fire and how to function in battle over extended periods of time spite of it, but that's all it lacked. The movie also helps explain why men don't normally talk of such battles, because the movie makes it so easy to see why words would fail them.<br/><br/>Since the film is about the ultimate sacrifice each man depicted in the movie knew he may have to make, it also rightfully and poignantly shows what it was like for his also very real family waiting and hoping he would come home.  And what it was like to arrive home and open the door and look at your wife again, a day you weren't sure would ever happen.  Those who trivialize those scenes as Hollywood sappiness just don't understand, and have never been there.  If anything, the movie is not dramatic enough.<br/><br/>At a fundamental level the movie is really about what it's like to fight for your country on any of history's fearsome battlefields, and how important it is to have smart and courageous battlefield leadership, and the difference one man can make.  No movie I've seen has done that better.  Indeed, that is no doubt why the movie took the time to show the human face of the North Vietnamese soldiers, and to show that they too had courage and families who missed them.<br/><br/>Those who have written to bash the US and this movie have apparently failed to appreciate that the movie is really about the heroism of their own nation's soldiers who have with similar bravery and sacrifice fought for their country, as the movie made no claim that the valor depicted was unique to the American military of the 1960's.   I think few battlefield veterans of any nation would think this a poor movie.   A 10 out of 10."

The scene where mel gibson's character prays the hail mary with his children moved me to tears.<br/><br/>Another thing that I enjoyed was that plot wasn't all sappy like they stick in so many war films these days to, maybe, make it more appealing to women. The goodbye's to their wives wasn't over done and scenes where the women receive their telegrams is justifiably a tear jerker.<br/><br/>Finally, I appreciate the films theme of being a thank you to vietnam vets, in that it didn't portray them as druggies and baby killers, but as true patriots that loved their fellow soldier."

It was one of the best movies that I've seen in a long while. I was born in 1964 and grew up watching the Vietnam war on TV, but until I saw this movie that's mostly all the war was to me, some images on TV and some pages in a history book. I hope people see this film and come away being as proud of the vietnam veterans as I am, and as interested in learning more about this controversial war. Whether you approved of the politics behind this war or not, no one should downplay the courage of the men (and women) who fought in this war while most of us stayed home in our snug little beds. The way the vietnam veterans have been treated since they returned home is disgraceful. It's time they were shown some respect. I've read other user comments that decry the patriotism shown in this movie. What I want to know is, what's wrong with being patriotic? The makers of this film and all the actors involved should be proud of the way this movie made me feel. I saw many people crying (as I was myself) at this moving tribute to the men who fought and died in the Ia Drang Valley during those three days in 1965.

I went into the theater and was shocked at how good it was. This was a topic that has been avoided for far too long and Vietnam should be brought up. We should not shed light on the corrupt politics that needlessly slaughtered 58,000 boys for no lasting gain, but on the bravery and courage of the men who fought. These boys fought because their country asked them to, and they did it bravely and honorably.

In Saving Private Ryan, Hollywood used a lot of gore in the opening scenes, more for shock value than for plot. The blood in this movie is obviously a fire engine red paint. This movie doesn't need or want shock value. Several scenes are like watching friends run through a hailstorm of high velocity razor blades, and in the end you truly understand the price of freedom. As you read this, understand that our country is once again at war. Freedom only accepts one coin as payment, and the price is indeed high. I won't tell you who lives and who doesn't, but I will tell you that the movie ends with the names of the men who died defending us. The movie is a fitting tribute not only to them, but to the families they left behind.

This film depicts the very real idealism of some who served during the tumultuous Vietnam War, and their commitment to their oneness as a unit, as a cadre, and as brothers under fire. Not merely content to demonstrate this strength of being amongst combatants, this film shows with clarity and heart wrenching dignity, the steadfast love of the wives for their men who fought and for many, did not return. Truly an inspiring movie that does not glorify the concept of war, but the character of the men and women who are asked to engage an enemy on the battlefield and do so with unfailing devotion."

","This is one hell of a great movie. This movie should be shown to history classes in schools and colleges--minus a few curse words. It shows how real, rough and deadly war is. Gibson has really outdone himself in this one. I can't imagine this not getting an academy award. But even if they elites do decide to blackball or ignore this one--which I don't think they be able to do--considering it's already done over 40.8 million in only it's first 10 days. And the word will spread about what a great movie this is. I have yet to speak to anyone whose seen the movie who didn't like it. It's a shame Hollywood can't make more great and accurate movies about History like this one. Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, and even down to the who played the coward were great in their roles. Kinnear was so good as Crandell and deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. The women who played the wives were great in their roles as well. Rarely does a movie take the time to show the women in this way: where you can see the pain they have to go through in dealing with the deaths of their husbands."

","I am a huge fan of Saving Private Ryan.  We Were Soldiers brings the bar up for true war stories being told through the movie medium.  While Saving Private Ryan has to be the best war movie when it comes to being told as a fictional story, We Were Soldiers does the same thing except it is based on true events.  If you liked Saving Private Ryan, please give this movie a try.  You won't regret it."
"marteengreene","10","2","3","10 March 2002"," A Very Powerful Movie!
","I have to admit, I was a little reluctant to see this movie at first. I kept thinking NOT ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT VIETNAM!!!! I think this war has been the one war Hollywood has severely overplayed. It was nice to see a break with films like The Patriot, Saving Private Ryan or even Black Hawk Down but still do we have to discuss the Viet Kong yet again.<br/><br/>Well, I have to admit after I went and watched this movie it is probably one of the best war movies I have ever seen. You can very easily drop this battle at any time other than Vietnam. I think it would be just as powerful if it took place during the Korean war, WWI, WWII, or even during Desert Storm. It's more about the people involved in the war and how they strategically plan their moves than most of the other recent films dare to be. It also does a really nice job on the way it touches on the real life moments when the wives receive notice that their loved ones have been lost. Watching it reminded me more of a film like Bridge on the River Kwai then Platoon. I won't deny that some of the graphic scenes are rather gruesome (especially the burned soldier) but then war is a gruesome tragedy. All in all, the movie does a great way to display the human side of war.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT) I also really seemed to enjoy the ending when Moore had not only taken the time to write a letter of condolence to Mrs. Geoghegan but one to the wife of the fallen NVA soldier as well. This sequence was probably one of the greatest highlights I have seen in a recent war drama. That would be (in my humble opinion) one of the hardest things in the world to do and really seems to capture the essence of what type of man Moore really was. (END SPOILER)<br/><br/>So, if you can think past the idea that this takes place during Vietnam long enough to buy a ticket, then I urge you to see it. I don't think you'll be disappointed."

","I found this film to be a very moving tribute to those who laid their lives on the line for the USA and, infact, the overall fight against communism in the 1960's and 1970's in Vietnam. Many, many, aspects can be put into the equation of trying to understand the Vietnam war. I thought the film dealt with several of these very well. I was impressed with how it focused not just on the men, but also their families at home. The comradeship in such a situation, but also the death, injury and destruction, brings home the horror of the Vietnam conflict. I hope this film inspires the American population today to give thanks to those who fought for them during that dark time. I strongly recommend you see this film, especially if you are interested in the conflict - or even if you know little about it. A word of warning though - the violence is very graphic (more so than Saving Private Ryan, for example)."

For that I can only thank God.<br/><br/>The details of the movie were even worse in the book. It's a heartbreaking story but it needed to be told.

"imyjr","10","2","3","7 March 2002"," Perhaps a classic
","Let us not forget that at some level, this is a great action flick: it promises action, delivers action, some of the most harrowing action ever captured on film. The action is clear, understandable, chaotic and unpredictable...... and magnificently filmed. The cinematography is aptly beautiful, without the (arguably) annoyingly self-conscious beauties of Thin Red Line, but still beautiful (e.g. whenever helicopters took to the sky).<br/><br/>Over and beyond, this is a very moving, very sad film. The loyalty of the men to each other is deep and meaningful. They were mostly conscripts; Vietnam was not even a big war yet in the American consciousness (1965). One can already sense the ambiguities and pitfalls of the disgraceful policy and horrible tragedy Vietnam would eventually become. The only cause these soldiers truly understood was the personal need to fight so as to defend each other in extremely perilous circumstances which they neither comprehended nor had chosen. They were soldiers.  Magnificent film.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson gives the performance of his life and more so than by just avoiding the Mel Gibson star turn and for once creating character. Greg Kinnear shows potential as a wonderful action hero. Chris Kline is quietly strong and touching. The music score is magnificent and ingeniously integrated with the actual sounds of the film narrative... yes it is calculated to pull at your heart-strings, and it does...... masterfully.<br/><br/>
This is a must-see film, one that could become a classic."

"tabuno","9","1","1","15 January 2019"," A Somber, Walloping War Drama
","1 November 2014. Some people might refer to Saving Private Ryan (1998) as one the great classic war films, especially its extended opening scene of the landing on Normandy Beach on D-Day. Others might refer to Black Hawk Down (2001) for its extended failed military mission in Somalia as one of the most gripping battle action films. Still others would cite Apocalypse Now (1979) as the most intense, personal, surrealistic war movie. Other films that people would laud loudly about would include The Hurt Locker (2008)or Dr. Strangelove (1964) for their cynical look at war, Jarhead (2005) for its immersive, ambient experience of long moments of war.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers, however, is an unabashed look at the terror and fearsome pain and emotional ripping apart of familial bonds and the heat and sorrow and fear and honor and courage of the individual and team effort of battle. Regardless of how might believe, feel of President Obama's reluctance to continue American commitment to Iraq or Afghanistan, even Syria, this movie is a must see before one should reflect on the realities of war and its impact. Perhaps the closest this movie might come or a movie to compare We Were Soldiers to might be the epic Civil War movie Gettysberg (1993). We Were Soldiers is presented in a non-glorified way with an inclusionary experience of the wives of many of the soldiers as well. We see glimpses of the Vietnamese soldier themselves.<br/><br/>The only small weaknesses of this movie might be its imbalance of primarily focusing on the American military experience with a significant but still token view of the emotive backdrop of the Vietnamese and one scene where there is an attempt to local lost American soldiers on the field of battle that doesn't seem quite realistic and perhaps even fool-hearty as well as omission of some of the more graphic hand to hand combat images while at the same time including the bloody bullets ripping through bodies themselves. But none of these weaknesses detract from the overall greatest of this movie.<br/><br/>In sum We Were Soldiers seems to reflect some of the best, if not the best directorial, scripted, and filmed movie about the awfulness of war in a human and compassionate but somber way."
"a_chinn","9","1","1","15 July 2018"," Mel Gibson takes his savage depiction of warfare to Vietnam
","Mel Gibson did not direct this film, but his production company made the film and he served as producer, so his fingerprints are all over this film, once again bringing his savage depiction of war to the big screen in much the same way he did with ""Braveheart"" and ""Hacksaw Ridge."" Randall Wallace was the writer and director of the film and had previously worked with Gibson as screenwriter on ""Braveheart"" and is currently working with Gibson again on his new film ""The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection."" With ""We Were Soldiers,"" Wallace and Gibson tell the true story of Lt. Col. Hal Moore in the first major US engagement with the North Vietnamese Army at the Battle of Ia Drang. Some of the events and characters were compressed for dramatic purposes, but the film is largely true to the real-life battle. The film beings with a Gibson and family living on an army base putting together a new unit for a mission overseas, entering into the first conflict of the Vietnam War, just as French forces were pulling out. Much time in this first part of the film is spent establishing the characters, two standouts being a grim Sam Elliott as Gibson's second in command and Greg Kinnear as a brash Cavalry helicopter pilot nicknamed Snakeshit, showing the men with their families, and introducing the various character dynamics while on base, but once they hit the fields of battle in Vietnam, the film is an unrelentingly brutal battle that makes up a majority of the film. Wallace does a masterful job of filming the battle scenes, especially when it comes to clearly defining the action and geography of the battlefield, which is no small feat given the scope of this battle and the many fronts needing to be shown, both in the air and on ground. The slow motion battle scenes lack the elegance of a Sam Peckinpah film, but are more in line with the straightforward brutality of Samuel Fuller or Gibson's own depiction of war. The battle scenes here are not your typical war film depictions when it comes to now shying away from showing the horrors of war. Even compared to Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" this is an especially brutal war film that is best compared to Gibson's own ""Hacksaw Ridge."" As with Hacksaw, although the film does not shy away from a savage depiction of war, it's not at all an anti-war film and is instead a celebration of the US military and the men who serve. The film does not really go into the politics of the Vietnam war, which was probably for the best and would have undercut the film's celebration of these soldiers. After rewatching ""We Were Soldiers,"" and something I wonder about after watching most films directed by Gibson, is if it's more something about his own nature in wanting to show on-screen depiction of extreme violence. Even with his film about the Mayans, Gibson managed to steer the story into one that was wildly brutal and violent. Gibson may just be a disturbed individual, but he's a hell of a filmmaker. On the downside for this film, when it cuts away from the battlefield to the wives back home, it comes to a corny maudlin grinding halt. Gibson's wife in the film, Madeline Stowe, takes it upon herself to deliver the notification letters to the wives of men killed in action instead of the faceless military men delivering the grim news. This homefront story in itself, focusing on the impact of war on the families back home, would have been a worth story to tell in and of it's own, but this subplot is given short shrift and feels more just tacked on as some sort of way to illustrate the human impact of war, but it's not given enough time to be fully explored, especially when it's clear that the filmmakers were much more focused on the battle elements of the film. Overall, ""We Were Soldier"" is amongst the most powerful and frightening depictions of war ever committed to the screen, while at the same time celebrates and honors the military and the men who make up that fighting force, without any commentary on the war itself. Keri Russell, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, and John Hamm also appear in the film. INTERESTING FACT: One of the real-life officers who survived the battle was Lieutenant Rick Rescorla. He died in the 9/11 attacks, while employed as Head of Security for Morgan Stanley, while making sure all of the company's employees had gotten out of the World Trade Center, which they did, and is in keeping with the brothers in arms type of heroism depicted in ""We Were Soldiers."""
"tomgillespie2002","6","1","1","22 November 2017"," Intense and well-staged, but nothing we haven't seen before
","After Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan reinvented the way the brutality and chaos of war was depicted on the cinema screen back in 1998, Hollywood went slightly nuts for all things World War II. At one point, it felt as though we were getting one every other week, and fatigue naturally kicked in, especially since none measured up to Spielberg's visual masterpiece (if very flawed film), other than Terrence Malick's superior The Thin Red Line released the same year. By 2002, attention was moving towards the Vietnam conflict, an unjust and borderline psychotic war that resulting in heavy losses on all sides. It was a favourite topic for many filmmakers in the 1980's, and produced a few greats, but interest seemed to wane as we moved into the 90's. In 2002, We Were Soldiers was supposed to rekindle our fascination with Vietnam, but has since faded into a long list of half-forgotten war movies.<br/><br/>Based on the book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young by Hal Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, Randall Wallace's film attempts to cover the Battle of Ia Drang from three perspectives: the 400 American men fighting at the front, the 4,000 Vietnamese troops they're up against, and the wives at home fearing the arrival of a taxi cab bringing them unwanted news. The bulk of the action follows Moore (Mel Gibson), then a lieutenant colonel, through training his troops and eventually onto the front line, where intelligence is so sparse that they have no idea what they are up against. It turns out that the Americans are greatly outnumbered, and so begins one of the bloodiest battles of the entire war. He is later joined by reporter Galloway (Barry Pepper), who captured much of the conflict on camera as well as picking up a rifle himself. At home, Moore's wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) intercepts all the letters informing the devastated wives of their loss to hand-deliver them herself.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers feels like more of a complete overview on the battle thanks to this unique perspective, while the action is some of the toughest and most unflinching in the genre. Perhaps down to its more observational approach - apparently the events take place almost exactly how it played out in real life - the film often gets criticised and labelled as a pro-war movie. I don't feel that what we see is glamorising or promoting war in any way. On the contrary, it refuses to really to take a stand, and this is what makes Wallace's movie far less interesting than it should be. It all boils down to 'war is Hell', but most people know this already whether they have experienced combat or not. The battle scenes are intense, horrifying and well-staged, and demand to be admired from a technical point of view. But it's nothing we haven't seen before. Despite Chris Klein's failure to really convince as a human, We Were Soldiers features many impressive performances, most notably by Sam Elliott as Sgt. Major Plumley, a gruff Sam Elliott-type who mows down his enemies with a revolver while the rest of his men pack automatics, and Gibson himself, who helps tug on the heartstrings during quiet moments of reflection."

","When Steven Spielberg released Saving Private Ryan in 1998, it set the new standard for epic war films. We Were Soldiers uses some of those same effects/devices to tell a compelling Vietnam War story.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, We Were Soldiers tells the story of one of the first Vietnam battles. It follows the First Battalion, 7th Cavalry division through their training, deployment, and improbably ""victory"" (depending on your perspective) in that seminal battle.<br/><br/>Strangely, this film doesn't stand out much on its own accord (it doesn't do anything all that original). However, it does enough things right to make for a very enjoyable, emotional experience.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson shines as the lead actor, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, whose primary goal is to bring ""his boys"" back to the mainland alive. In fact, this is one of the best roles I've ever seen Gibson in, far better than the action-hero roles he often fancies himself in. The other members of the battalion are also well-cast and peppered with great actors.<br/><br/>However, this film is at its best when it tugs at your heartstrings, which it does frequently. Whether it is the physical toughness of the soldiers in the field, or the mental grit of their wives/families back home, this movie really ""gets"" the emotions of that time period. Plus, it really does a good job of foreshadowing the rest of the drawn-out conflict.<br/><br/>Thus, whereas First Blood is best in my book at examining the mental torments of 'Nam, We Were Soldiers touches on those same emotions but also adds the epic battle scenes."
"db_crm","10","1","1","14 April 2015"," Not just a violent shoot em up war drama
","Not an emotional sort but this film hit me right between the eyes. Born in 65, this film kept nudging my conscience on how many wasted lives, good lives put through the grinder. In addition to very well done combat scenes reflective elements of the families who sacrifice in silence of not knowing what is happening to their loved ones in harms way. Its easy for those with no blood in the game to not understand but this film at least attempts give those who don't live in a military family the anxiety and loss they live with everyday. I really hope the hawks who press the on buttons for our war machines really watch this film if only to remind them of early warning signs of one our countries greatest follies and who really does pay the ultimate price. Well done Mel Gibson."

","We Were Soldiers (2002)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Focusing on the Battle of Ia Drang on November 14, 1965. It is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once¬Ö And Young by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway, both of whom were at the battle.<br/><br/>This is quite simply one of my favourite war movies, Gibson's performance is the core of the movie, and is one of his best performances. I love his reaction to a certain characters death, almost no words except ""He died keeping my promise"" and pure raw emotion. Chris Klein gives the performance of his career, Sam Elliot is his usual brilliant self, uttering fine great dialogue, whilst Madeline Stowe, Greg Kinnear Barry Pepper and Kerri Russell all of stellar support. There are some strong female performances featured here, not commonly found in a war movie!! This is brilliantly shot, directed and scored. <br/><br/>It does have a few clich√© moments, but it's hard to criticise a movie for something so little, when it gets so much right. <br/><br/>For some reason, audiences didn't flock to this one, it only grossed $78 million at the domestic box office, to end 2002 as the 34th highest grossing movie of the year. Which for a Gibson led movie, was pretty low for the time. <br/><br/>Gibson is truly a great actor, and hopefully he can sort his personal problems and demons out, because as we all know Hollywood loves comebacks."
"joncheskin","8","1","1","15 January 2015"," Realistic Tribute to All Affected by Vietnam
","There are many people writing reviews who are willing to make claims that this movie is ""realistic"" or ""hogwash"" or whatever. As someone who did not fight in the Ia Drang Valley, my first question would be-- how would you know? I will say this movie seemed pretty realistic to me, and Hal Moore and Joe Galloway, the writers of the book and participants in the battle seemed satisfied with it, so I bet you it is pretty real. And already, this is a big plus for this movie.<br/><br/>What I think might be off-putting to some people is that fact that the movie has some big stars--Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear-- that we have seen a million times before. If the actors had been anonymous, I suspect that the movie would have seemed more ""realistic."" Gibson in fact does his Georgia drawl pretty well, but loses it every so often in one of his ""Braveheart"" moments of pathos.Similarly, the musical score has a Scottish lament that seems bizarre for this movie. Are we still doing ""Braveheart""?<br/><br/>On the upside however, we get corroboration from the participants that the war scenes are pretty real, and they are BRILLIANTLY choreographed. Ever since Saving Private Ryan, these movies have gotten A LOT more graphic. We Were Soldiers has some utterly gruesome scenes in it that are probably quite true to life. Again, this is a big plus, since we don't want to remember the fighting as anything but something very ugly.<br/><br/>Also, unlike some other Vietnam films, there are some believable moments involving two parties not often heard from: the soldiers' wives and the enemy. Hal Moore's wife delivers death telegrams to the other vets' wives so that they don't have to receive them from the Yellow Cab company. I have no doubt that this was true, and the scenes are NOT melodramatic, they are heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Similarly, one of the best characters of the movie is General An of the NVA. He is again terrifically believable as the sanguine commander of the enemy forces, and we see him as a clever, thoughtful and even compassionate commander heartbroken about the state of his country but willing to do what it takes to defend it. The mental duel that he has with Colonel Moore (Mel Gibson) also provides a terrific subplot.<br/><br/>On balance, this movie is really worth it. In making a Vietnam movie that really tries to tell the story realistically, we get an excellent tribute not just to the US Vets, but also to everyone affected, even the Vietnamese foe. It is a tough movie to watch, but it is also perhaps the healthiest response to Vietnam that I have ever seen."
"kristoffe-brodeur","10","1","1","20 October 2014"," excellent in every way
","I found this piece to really bring out the best in film making. The entire flow of the film made me think the editing was slow and yet full of detail. Little motions in everything, the prayer with his children and his daughter's toes wiggling as they didn't reach the ground were great. The lighting in each scene when artificial felt thought out quite convincingly and the outer scenes were scouted perfectly.<br/><br/>The characters were scripted well and they felt entertaining, as this was not a documentary but a based on fact fictionary. Being in the military can be quite boring and then entirely too exciting in the worst ways, and this was very visceral and realistic.<br/><br/>I thin each actor was ground out a good character and they were properly cast. The costumes were great, the vietcong were determined, and it was a pleasure to ride through the era in this film.<br/><br/>I didn't mention the soundtrack and audio effects, maybe because they were on point, bird sounds added in, slight points here and there with great coverage in the gaps with the music.<br/><br/>The end.

Three days and two nights of none stop fighting over this valley costs both sides dearly. During the battle, Hal Moore makes some incredible things happen. He is able to keep many of his own troops alive while suffering major loses. The Americans after three days and two nights of not sleeping, make a desperate charge on the Vietnamese base. The Vietnamese are prepared for this and they are ready to kill every last one of Hal Moore's troops.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is based on a book called ""We Were Soldiers¬ÖOnce"" written by Hal Moore. The battle in The Valley of Death is one of the major battles fought by the Americans in the Vietnam War. One of the great things about Hal Moore is when he is delivering a speech to his men before they are shipped off to Vietnam; he says that he will bring everyone home dead or alive. This film shows the hardship and objectives of each fighting force. The Vietnamese are fighting for land and freedom from the French while the Americans are fighting to help keep Vietnam under French rule.<br/><br/>I believe that We Were Soldiers is a great movie depicting what happened at a battle that many people do not know about. I am really impressed on how Mel Gibson got the military rank right along with the corresponding symbols. Viewing the battle from both sides gives you a perspective of how each side is thinking for the battle. Some of the fight I did not like because it would show a Vietnamese officer telling his troops what to do, then a second later it show Hal Moore telling his troops to defend that position."
"thewillt08","6","1","1","12 September 2012"," War Movie with Emotion and Story
","I can honestly say I was surprised by the movie We Were Soldiers. We Were Soldiers stars Mel Gibson as a military man leading a group of platoons in the Vietnam War. The movie focuses on the combat of Vietnam and delivers some really good action scenes, but also brings emotion and love to the table. Mel Gibson brings an average performance, compared to other roles he has played, but still gets the job done, but who stole the show in my opinion was the wives of the soldiers. They played a huge role and they were as close as the soldiers were and that shows a lot. They delivered each other's telegrams when they had to find out their husbands were dead. It is just loyalty and friendship the audience should appreciate.<br/><br/>The beginning on the movie shows the soldiers in training and with their families. This gave the audience time to know the soldiers and fall in love with their characters. One soldier had a newborn baby then left to fight. Character development was strong in the beginning while action and battle carried out till the end. The character that Mel Gibson played was certainly interesting with his devotion to the army and God. After seeing Passion of The Christ I did think it was weird seeing Mel Gibson praise the man he would later slaughter in one of his movies, but that's just a side note. Gibson's character is a leader and he motivates his squad giving a great speech before they deploy. He promises no man will be left behind and as I'm sure that promise cannot be kept it would still make me feel batter as a soldier. He talks about how soldiers are family and Gibson just naturally plays the role. The only problem I had with him was he showed little emotion and seemed like a statue, even during battle. It didn't seem human, how can a man just not react? He always kept his composer. I'm sure some people thought it was a god thing but I did not like it.<br/><br/>I also loved Gibson's second hand man, forgive me for not knowing characters names because there are so many of them and I only saw the movie once. Anyway, the old guy with the pistol, he was great. While he showed little emotion his seriousness brought a laugh here and there, intimidation, and a veteran presence. He was an old school guy who preferred the old school way. I liked how the movie had little Easter eggs, for example, he says he prefers the pistol to the new M16 and Gibson says something like, ""how do you know the enemy will be that close."" Then later in the movie he shoots people down with his pistol from close range. <br/><br/>There were definitely many problems with this movie, the main one being the length. This movie was two hours and twenty minutes. After about an hour and a half I thought the movie would be wrapping up but instead it introduced a new character and kept on going. The new character was the camera man and he took pictures of the carnage of Vietnam, His character was definitely important and needed, but he came in too late. He had such a presence and brought a different attitude and tone to the movie it just got under used. <br/><br/>Other problems were too much use of slow motion and too many jumps and surprises with deaths. A soldier would be walking and then he would be dead. That effect to start a battle isn't bad but it was overused. Final seconds of a soldier's life were cheesy with their last words and their reactions. ""Tell my wife I love her"" works but it didn't work where it was used. <br/><br/>I give the movie credit for sticking really well to the time period. Introducing the M16 rifle and the use of Napalm are small parts of the movie with an impact. People who love history and the military would appreciate that and the movie does a good job of knowing its facts and doing the research.<br/><br/>Overall, We Were Soldiers was not a bad movie, but it was not fantastic either. I have seen better war movies and I have seen worse. Acting was a little shaky but strong overall; the story dragged a little bit and was too long but still memorable. I would watch it again and buy it to see again. Watch it with a bunch of your guy friends to enjoy a manly movie that women can still enjoy and maybe even cry to. We Were Soldiers is a good time but does not get the WillyT Seal of Approval."

","We Were Soldiers is about the story of the first major battle of the American phase of the Vietnam War and the soldiers on both sides that fought it. We Were Soldiers was one of my favorite war films growing up and still is one of my favorites. Director, Randall Wallace, takes you into this gritty, realist war film. What stands with the directing style of, We Were Soldiers, is the use of a steadicam affectively for action sequence. When you watch this film you get right into the middle of the action, seeing all the detail and emotions. I like the film grain; it adds to the grittiness of war. The performances in We Were Soldiers are great and succeeds with giving the characters life. It's always bad in films characters are so flat and lifeless because of the acting and character development. You get none of that in this film. Mel Gibson leads in We Were Soldiers and this by far one of his best performances of his career. The emotion you feel from beginning to end from Gibson is astounding. From the very beginning you see that he cares about being a parent, husband, & soldier. By the end of this film Mel Gibson has my eyes tearing up because of how much he loves his country and soldiers. The only tiny problem with this film is that it falls to little war movie clich√©s, but that didn't bother me. We Were Soldiers comes highly recommended for those who love war films."

","After reading many of the comments on this movie, I wonder if I saw the same movie. Clich√©? Nope. Boring? Absolutely not. Poorly acted? Well, aside from M. Stowe who bugged me for some reason,(did she remind anyone else like Cher?) the cast did a fine job. I would have liked to have seen more on some of the characters we were introduced to, such as ""too tall"". Sam Elliot did a marvelous job-definite nod for best supporting actor. For those of the reviewers thinking he was a clich√© character, THAT'S THE WAY MASTER SEARGEANTS ARE! He's from WWII! He's regular army! <br/><br/>I thought the filming location for the battle could've been better chosen. It looked like the hills of Virginia. I wished the Scottish hymn sung three to four times were not played as much. To me, it was a little overdone...ok a lot overdone.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd definitely see it again- not like Titanic or Black Hawk Down, where I did enjoy those movies but I'll never ever have any desire to see them again. Go see it. I think you'll like it. Then, READ THE BOOK!<br/><br/>

"driffma","9","1","1","2 March 2002"," A really good, but not quite great film about the vietnam conflict
","We were soldiers once....and young.  That is the title of the book from which this well made film was adapted. Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot are excellent, as is the whole cast, and the battle is intense, horrifying and appropriately unpleasant (war after all isn't fun).  I can not however give it a 10. The handling, or maybe mishandling of the women at home makes me hesitant.  There seems a falsness to their scenes for the most part.  Not all of it, but most of the women and their interactions with one another all seem forced. It is no fault of the actresses, who seem to take the material they have been given just about as far as it can go.  Like I said though, not all of the women's scenes feel strained (watch closely the second letter delivery which is nicely acted and remarkably touching).<br/><br/>The movie does not let one view the action at too great a distance. This is no John Wayne war movie, all heroics and patriotism without much reflection on the conflict being portrayed.  This movie isn't about flagwaving, which is shocking considering Randall Wallace, the films writer and director, also wrote the worthless and pathetic Pearl Harbor. There is however alot to be said for good direction.  And Wallace here demonstrates some more discretion with cheesy manipulative tactics than the director of Pearl Harbor demonstrated. It is there, mostly in some questionable shot composition, but still present. Note to all future film-makers making war pictures, placing key actors in scenes with conspicuously placed U.S. flaggs almost always seems contrived. What is really interesting about this vietnam war film is that it almost completely sidesteps politics.  We see that politics are going to play a role in landing Lt. Col. Moore (the Gibson character)and his men in a really tight spot. Moore knows this is going to cost lives, maybe even his own but he is a soldier, he will do his best to achieve his objective and reduce the loss of life of his men.  Also in leaving the politics out of it and also showing both sides of fight we realize, as we watch, that both sides really aren't that different, that ultimately the men on either side are fighting for the same reason. The viewer also notices that all of the combatants, except for Gibson and Elliot, are young, barely one over thirty.  And I think for americans that is such a key difference from WWII and the Vietnam conflict.  Young, young men went to fight in Vietnam.  It is a fact that even the main character, Moore, finds hard to get over.  ""I look at the men and all I see are my boys."" The film can't dwell on the disillusionment that grew as the conflict lengthened, however it shows how the seeds were planted. The movie's thesis is that a soldier doesn't fight for country, for ideas, for abstracts, but that the soldier fights for the man next to them, for thier platoon, their family. It is the same message as that in Black Hawk Down, and I think the same message that you might find the film Platoon.  I don't know if that is completely true but movies like Black Hawk and We were soldiers certainly make one understand why that motivation is so integral to the soldier."
"pauldan","9","1","1","3 March 2002"," Touching, emotional, graphic and gritty
","One of the most moving movie experiences I've ever had.  I was mesmerized (and exhausted) by this film. I was just young enough to miss having to go to Vietnam, but not so young that I didn't oppose the war at that time. This film transcends the politics of the age and focuses on the sacrifices that were made for this country by our young fighting men.  I thought Mel Gibson was fantastic.  He has risen to be an actor that draws you in and keeps you into his performance.  His face alone speaks volumes in many scenes.  I wanted to see this movie so I could again experience, at least through a film (as in Saving Private Ryan), the horrors of war, so I could gain a grain of understanding of how horrible it must have been to be in situations as illustrated by this film.  An ordinary looking beautiful sunny day turns into a nightmare within just a few moments.  The movie is graphic, grizzly, and exhausting.  I had tears streaming down my face by the end of the movie, just for knowing that this type of horror went on then, and is still going on around the world.  I thought that the quote offered by the North Vietnamese commander at the end of the movie was quite profound and sadly, quite true.  This is not an ordinary movie, if you're looking simply to have a good time and be entertained, don't go.  This movie has a deeper message than simple entertainment, and some of the scenes are truly horrifying.  I give it a 9 out of 10."

There were some moments in the film that had be wondering when shots were going to be fired becuase it got really quite all of a sudden.  The reason why I loved this movie was becuase the action was really violent, intense and it had a bit of drama in it.  I wouldn't reccommend this movie to kids becuase it's pretty bloody.

","'We Were Soldiers' is definately a movie to go see, but take heed if you are weak of stomach.  For me personally, I did not mind the graphic details but others around me were covering their mouths and cringing.  Mel Gibson is my favorite actor and I can say he did a wonderful job, but it certainly isn't his best work.  The acting was good, the camera work was astounding, the suspense kept me at the edge of my seat for a good portion of the movie.

"mfoster12754","9","1","1","1 March 2002"," Excellent film but bring the tissues
","This movie has everything for movie lovers, both male and female. The men will love all the blood and guts and the women will be brought to tears from all the emotional scenes of husbands going off to war, babies being born and raised that you know are about to become fatherless. I had to leave the theater at one point when the Col's wife was going to all the widow's houses. Every teen ager (and young adult too, for that matter) needs to see this film to realize what it was really like in Vietnam. Most of them do not have a clue. Mel Gibson was first-rate in his portrayal of Lt. Col. Moore, who is sent, under-manned, in to what he is sure is a suicide mission. I went in to this not expecting much but was surprised, despite the wrenching emotion dragged out of me, that it was a very well-made film. I am NOT a fan of Chris Klein and thought, oh, no, not him again, he can't act, but his character is appropriately understated, not flagged out as - HEY EVERYBODY - HERE IS A BIG STAR - PAY ATTENTION TO THIS CHARACTER as most filmmakers do. Sam Elliott did an excellent job playing Mel Gibson's right hand man, Greg Kinnear also turned in a solid performance as the unfailing helicopter pilot. Everyone involved in this movie should be very proud to have been a part of it."
"dale_durnell","9","1","1","3 March 2002"," Brings back a lot of memories
","Mel Gibson is no John Wayne, and this is not ""The Green Berets."" And while the humanity of the leaders and the brutality of the war in Vietnam come through in both films, this film is so very different.<br/><br/>Fierce in its intensity and as graphically accurate as a film can be, the movie is serious fare and not for the lighthearted. For those of us who were there, in country, this film is a savage reminder of the stupidity of politicians trying to legislate a war. From the early war scenes of the French in Indo-China, to the (in retrospect) prophetic statement of the Vietnamese commander at the end of the film, the story is cast in a very historical light.<br/><br/>That this is a new kind of war, with new troops, new weapons, and new tactics does not escape Gibson's character. Thus, the film shows that not only in the field but back home, as Madeleine Stowe's character remarks, ""the Army wasn't prepared for this.""<br/><br/>Early on, we meet Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) as a family man, but also as a professional soldier. And, we meet Sgt Major Plumley (Sam Elliot) as the grizzled old warrior. Together, they know that it will be a tough job to get these kids trained and to keep (in as much as it might be possible) these youngsters from getting killed. Barry Pepper is outstanding in his role as a news photographer who hops a ride to the battle.<br/><br/>Even in ""Soldiers"" the life of those ""who sit and wait"" is not well developed -- which can be explained given that the story is primarily of the story of those who have gone off to fight. Thus, we never get to really know Madeleine Stowe's character (Julie Moore) very well. Still, we do get an insight into her life as a take charge of the situation military spouse in the mid 60's. Additionally, the gathering of the wives, the sharing of their stories, and lives, is an added dimension that so many war films overlook. The naivety of many of us who were not from the segregated South is tastefully revealed and well played out.<br/><br/>The scene of a group of newspaper journalists and photographers arriving via helicopter after the fighting was typical of media of the day, and (in my humble opinion) not far removed from some of their antics today. After over three days of fighting, killing, and dying --the cleaned and pressed press corp comes in asking their usual repertoire of insensitive, if not stupid, questions. Sadly, this is one of the many accurate scenes in the film."
"x22213","10","1","1","12 February 2002"," Very Powerful
","I have just finished one of the most powerful emotional experiences of my life.  I had the opportunity to watch a preview of this movie with approximately 1500 other cadets.  Also seated with us were three of the stars of the movie (Mel Gibson, Madeline Stowe, and Chris Klein), approximately forty generals representing some of the highest ranking officers in the Army, and several retired Army officers and soldiers, who were present for the events depicted in the film.<br/><br/>The movie itself is an incredibly realistic depiction of warfare.  It is not only bloody, but it conveys the terror that a soldier would feel fighting outnumbered, surrounded, far-from safety, against an enemy that moves in swarms by day and by stealth at night.  At no time is the destruction glorified in any way.  In fact, its true impact is shown both on the other soldiers in the battle as well as the families left at home.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, I could empathize with the characters in a way that was stronger than any other movie that I have ever seen.  Throughout the movie, I could only think about how I could be in the same situation as these soldiers.  In about a year, I will have graduated, gotten married, nearly completed the standard infantry schooling, and be getting ready to take command of my first platoon.  Though the events depicted in the movie took place in a war that ended about thirty years ago, it is not hard to imagine me being in a similar situation in a very short time.  Technology has changed, but the basics remain the same.<br/><br/>As sat there, trying to imagine how I would react if thrust into such a chaotic situation, how my fiance would react if something happened to me, I was awe-struck by the courage and determination demonstrated by the soldiers that were there.  When the movie was over and the lights had come back on, I turned around and looked people that lived through the events just depicted on the screen.  Standing less than five feet from me were some true heroes. People that did what their country asked selflessly.  I have to say that by the end of the movie, I was as close to tears as I have ever come by any movie, a feeling shared by many of my fellow cadets."

","""We Were Soldiers"" is a powerful and moving testament to the men who fought & died in the Ia Drang valley on 1965.  It succeeds by abandoning the politics of so many other Vietnam films and simply focusing on the experiences of the men in the moment.  This was the tack taken by ""Black Hawk Down"", but by putting a clearer face on the enemy and by making the film about the way the battle changed the men, this film is actually better. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson gives a solid performance at Lt. Col. Moore and Sam Elliot is excellent as his second in command, a battle hardend Sargent Major who knows how to act in a fight.  The other performances are all blended together nicely, and the action is intense and horrifying.  War is not glorified in this picture, nor is America.  The stark scene at the end of the film of the Vietnam Memorial drives home the point that this film was about and for those wen in the Valley of Death.  Writer/Director Randall Wallace deserves credit for creating a moving picture of the first real battle of the Vietnam War, and in so doing earns a bit of forgiveness for writing ""Pearl Harbor"". All in all, an important movie that pulls no punches emotionally."

I have to say that General Moore's vision for this movie has been accomplished.  This movie is a work of success in all aspects.<br/><br/>As the son of a Viet Nam War hero who participated in the battle at Ia Drang Valley, the battle so eloquently depicted by this movie, I am excited to say that finally a movie is made that depicts our warriors for what they were: brave heroes who went out to do what their country asked them to do.<br/><br/>As far as war is concerned, this movie makes no excuses.  War, in all of it's bloody and gory splendor, is clearly depicted so that we can at least minutely and ever so remotely feel what our brave troopers went through. <br/><br/>

","A Loud Seven For one startling second, Mel Gibson as Hal Moore seemingly transforms into John Wayne during the celluloid version of the battle of Ia Drang in Randall Wallace's new film We Were Soldiers. The transformation is physical as well as metaphysical. Gibson doesn't merely bring back memories of Wayne, for that second he looks and sounds like the Wayne of World War Two flicks. No problem with that. The problem lies with looking and sounding like the Wayne fighting man of Viet Nam rather than the Wayne warrior of Iwo Jima. That  Duke in Ia Drang imagery brings to mind Wayne's clumsy, wrong headed direction of his own Viet Nam film/fiasco, The Green Berets. Maybe Mel's helmet is the problem. Throughout the film Gibson/Moore barks indecipherable orders from underneath a General Patton, G.I Joe helmet that looks like a refugee from a Bill Mauldin cartoon. We Were Soldiers relentlessly seems like an uncomfortable synthesis of WW2 films and Viet Nam films. In the language of cinema, Soldiers more closely resembles Saving Private Ryan or Guadalcanal Diary than it resembles Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. Certainly the battle of Ia Drang portrayed in We Were Soldiers deserves commemoration.  Ia Drang, fought in November of 1965 is often described as the first `conventional' battle of the Viet Nam war. Conventional apparently means, the way John Wayne or John Ford of George Patton would fight it, man to man with charges, sieges, fistfights and bayonets. The battle was so `conventional' and `productive' that General Westmoreland came to the brilliant realization that kill ratio would be a great method to keep score during the war, after all we killed nine times as many `of dem as dey killed ah us'. Using this scorekeeping method, we kept winning the war until 58,000 American citizens died and we left town and built a Wall. Nam remains a bewildering, enigma of startling sound and fury significance. In that regard, portraying war as hell rather than heck, chaos rather than order, We Were Soldiers succeeds. Soldiers is the most violent, bloodsoaked, burn blistered movie that I have ever seen with one image after another that I want to remove from my working memory. Even after a week, they  still remain. When, if, you see the movie, you'll know what I mean. Anyone seeking an ultra-violent reminder of pre 66 American military arrogance mixed with the remains of World War Two gung ho heroism directed by the guy who gave us The Man in the Iron Mask should go see We Were Soldiers particularly those who value cinema as a source of both headache and heartache. For all others, find a metaphoric helmet and put it over your sensitivities before entering the theater or do whatever else you would do when confronting a movie that I would rate as a very loud 7."

Aside from an amazingly realistic and often graphic telling of America's first bloody battle in Vietnam, Randall Wallace delivers a well-balanced perspective on the people and emotions involved in what would become one of the most trying periods in America's history.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not for the squeamish as it contains some extremely powerful battle scenes, but shining through many of those are beautiful illustrations of self sacrifice and the ever-present sentiment of leaving no one behind (see also `Black Hawk Down').<br/><br/>Mel Gibson gives an outstanding performance as Lt. Colonel Harold Moore. I know that the passion that this officer had for his family, his country, and his men is not unique amongst those who serve our country, but it is so refreshing to see honor and virtue exalted.  Harold Moore IV was apparently at the screening I saw, and I only hope that his generation grows up in the image of his great-grandfather.<br/><br/>There's not enough space to give the entire cast the credit they are due, but definitely worth mentioning are Madeleine Stowe as Moore's wife, Sam Elliott as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, Chris Klein as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, and Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway.

","There is no questioning of the Vietnam war in ""We Were Soldiers"" whatsoever. It is one of the ground rules in telling a story: To understand one person's actions you have to get to know one's motives, one's aim. But if the film tells us that the soldiers were only fighting for each other and not so much for their country, so why didn't they stop fighting. This film is 100% pro-war and doesn't even know why. It also draws an interesting view on gender topics. All the women in the film are depicted firstly as loving wives to their brave husbands and secondly they are doing the classical household works. And if you are asking, also in their caring for the widows they are acting as loving wives to their brave husbands. It's unbelievably reactionary. They are not even trying to hold their men back from fighting in Vietnam, because they know what the United States are fighting for. It's good that they know, because after 130 minutes the viewer of this movie won't."

I remember when he was speaking of a machine gunner in his unit that fought on and on long after being wounded...tears welled up on his eyes and he referred to him as a true hero.

This movie has the best balance I have ever seen, the combat is unmatched in realism, but if you are not lucky enough to see this movie in 5.1 surround, than you are missing out on a lot, because this movie audio blasts from all directions, from the screams of the wounded, to the main characters giving out orders, to the napalm bombs blowing up and giving off that distinctive sound of fire like a whip, to the bullets brushing off the leaves of the trees, to the explosion of artillery, the sound amazingly surpasses the visuals. Another strength of this movie, is its accuracy, in this movie you don't see people smoking weed and constantly drinking alcohol, like many Vietnam war flicks like to make out how our troops were in Vietnam, to try to de rank them as human beens, like they were a bunch of animals, well no, this movie is accurate to the tee, except for some minimal unimportant stuff. Some of the best scenes of this movie were when it came to be night time, there were 2 nigh time scenes, number 1 was the platoon cutoff scene where bugum tells the sarge to request illumination, and the sarge agrees and right in front of theme no farther than 15 yards were the ARVN, in another, they wake up to see the ARVN walk by theme, they pretend to be dead, and then the sarge messes up and makes too much noise putting his gun on Semi-auto, because his safety was on, it was a close nerve-racking experience, for movie viewers, overall see the movie, its like 10 bucks and its worth a lot more than that, if the Vietnam war means a lot to you not for the history of the country, but for the history of the 58,000 who died for stupidness, and for the MIA who are still out there, and the remains that still lie out there in the uninhabited jungles, RIP brave souls, you will not be forgotten."

But it's not a documentary - it's a movie and on some level it is intended to be both an artistic artefact and a piece of entertainment, and is not above criticism as either. What intrigues me is what it says about Gibson, because ostensibly although it is not about Gibson (it's about 'the men') Gibson's presence is a transcendent factor. Somewhere along the line this handsome, cheekboned 'Australian' matin√©e idol has become a chunky, stoic and troubled American who is increasingly marching to a different drum to mainstream Hollywood. 'Braveheart' could be said to be the turning point (another Wallace collaboration) where Gibson also wanted to showing the graphic slaughter of a 'real' battle, but which took on the entire historical context of the Scottish Wars of Independence in an a flagrantly unauthentic manner. With 'We Were Soldiers' the obsession with battle accuracy is maintained and the historical/political context almost entirely dispensed with. This might be unsettling, for those who think soldiers must always be thinking why they are being sent somewhere to do something, but the case Gibson makes (basically through 2 hours of cinematic attrition) is that soldiers are thinking of staying alive and/or through obeying orders. There is in some way an attempt to encapsulate the entire 'Vietnam experience' in two hours; reckless battle tactics, unprepared men, hostile terrain, a disciplined committed enemy, reliance on increasingly indiscriminate air support and of course, the role of 'the media' which is depicted with a conspicuous lack of sympathy near the end of the film. But the visual experience is of a maelstrom, once the battle begins, and after a while it is wearing. There is no character identification really outside the two leads and the graphic brutality is instructive without being revealing or, to be nakedly honest, that entertaining. It becomes more of a simulator than a film."

","I'm not a Mel Gibson fan, so that's probably why I didn't see this in the move theaters. Or, was it even in the theaters? Anyway, I stumbled across this movie just at it begun on TV. I almost turned it off, but I'm glad I didn't.<br/><br/>I think there are some sappy moments at the beginning, but given that the film is based on a true story, I'm sure moments like them happened in the somewhat innocent 1960s. As a film that covers the first major battle of Vietnam, it seems to offer an unbiased view (after all, the sentiment against the Vietnam war didn't exist yet in the U.S.).<br/><br/>The battle scenes are compelling to say the least. And, the combatants on both sides are depicted well. It's a testament to the spirit of a fighter (whether or not you agree with the fight itself).<br/><br/>Madeleine Stowe does a great job as the wife. Mel does a good performance of what is clearly a smart man. I got goosebumps during some of her later scenes as well as some of the battle scenes. The ensemble is great, and I think the movie does a very good job of covering the confusion, heroics, sacrifices, and politics of war. If only we could live in a world without war."

","""We Were Soldiers"" is a nicely made movie but isn't exactly memorable, original or impressive enough to leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>There are several problems I had with this movie. Perhaps the biggest problem was that it wasn't easy to follow. It was hard to tell who was where at the moment fighting. Basically all we ever get to see are the Americans and the NVA shooting at each other through bushes and running towards each other. The movie lacks a sense of scale and because of that the movie also doesn't ever really become realistic. It's interesting that they also show the NVA side of the battle, something that's a very rare thing in a Vietnam-war movie but it's all done in a very shallow and formulaic way.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another problem I had with this movie. It's all too formulaic and not original enough. The characters are build up in a sappy way and they lack substance and aren't likable or interesting enough. And having dying soldiers saying 'tell my wife I love her' has got to be one of the biggest movie clich√©s in movie history. There were really some scene's that made me cringe such as the scene in which a dying soldier says 'I'm glad I could die for my country'. I know it is wrong but I actually laughed and I mean really laughed during that scene. It was so embarrassing and totally unrealistic to look at. It took away all of the emotions and sense of desperateness and danger. It was a very over-dramatized and because of that also not a believable enough movie, to follow. They over-dramatized it even more to add the wives of the soldiers to the storyline. For me those sequences didn't worked and were only distracting and felt unnecessary.<br/><br/>The movie is good looking and the battle sequences are nicely set up but it never becomes really tense or spectacular. Because of that ""We Were Soldiers"" is a good looking movie that is worth watching just maybe once but at the same time is also very forgettable movie that lacks real substance.<br/><br/>The excellent musical score by Nick Glennie-Smith is wonderful though and is to be honest the only reason why I ever wanted to see this movie.<br/><br/>There are better and more realistic Vietnam war movies to watch out there instead. Randall Wallace has created a sappy, over-the-top dramatic movie that doesn't make an awfully large impression.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I have watched many films about 'Nam but this has to be the best. Sentimental, I know, but this adds to the whole feel of the movie. I have to admit I was in tears for most of the second half because this movie tells it like it is and makes you realise the futility of war (however necessary it is deemed at the time). The courage of men under fire and the feeling of brotherhood (or sisterhood when relating the side of the wives and family) is bang on. Having served my country I think this is the most accurate depiction I have seen about how men and women cope with the shear stress and emotion of the theatre of war. The script, however corny and weak it is at times, pulls you along and you feel both sympathy and anger at the same time, not necessarily towards either side."
"timberline_thunder","Null","3","6","1 April 2003"," Unique Vietnam War Movie
","Okay, let's leave out that one of my favorite movies, Braveheart, comes from the Gibson/Wallace team. This is still a good flick. Every Vietnam War movie I've seen before this one seems to have some angle, some statement to be made. Just like Job's friends, when we see something that doesn't make sense, it's human nature to put out our own take on it to try to reconcile what we have experienced. Yet, this is one of the few movies that hesitates to carry that burden. It doesn't overtly accuse the politicians, the press or the military for Vietnam's ultimate failure. It tells a story from a Lt. Colonel's perspective, not coming from some frightened kid's coming-of-age perspective and not with some leftist ideological blinders like Born on the Fourth of July, or Platoon, or--shudder--Apocalypse Now. It's told by a man who understands battle, the killing, and the maiming. It's told to pay tribute to men who answered their country's call to go and fight.<br/><br/>And men they were. They were men with families and friends. They were men who risked seeing their children grow up because of their willingness to go fight. As a father, that hits home. Few war movies pause to address the internal conflict a soldier must face prior to deployment and the turmoil it creates with those who love them. Fewer still recognize faith and religion's impact on the whole equation. It only adds depth to their characters and makes them more real. Man is a spiritual being, and far too often, that fact is overlooked for telling a story or to keep from making people ""uncomfortable.""<br/><br/>There are some intense moments and very graphic violence. The casual viewer may overlook one scene where a guy is struck by phosphorous. But burning phosphorous is like little chunks of the sun and it won't stop burning for anything. The aftermath where his buddy helps him still chills me because I know a little about what has to happen for him to survive. On the whole, the gore is significant and extensive. Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan are comparably tame by some measures. So unless you *live* for that sort of thing, you may come away with a queasy stomach.<br/><br/>I watched this during the second Persian Gulf War, so the ramifications of soldiers dying hit with much more force. Consider this when you make your movie choices. You may want a comedy or a classic instead of this, considering."

Forget the hype, the build-up, the critics. it's a good war movie, and on a par with the new 'measuring rod' of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>You don't have to agree with me. It's far and away better than Pearl Harbor, that's for sure! There is a stark, horrifying reality and pain in the scenes of battle and death in this film and as a jaded war film buff, that takes some doing, I can tell you. The acting is realistic, because it is not 'acted' but simply given realism by the tension of the moment. As for the ending, I know it was 'hollywoodized' but it still works. I was touched by the closing, and felt this was a good and 'sincere' effort to tell a story as well as make some serious money. I give it a 9/10."

Apparently some of us don't.<br/><br/>I also wonder if not everyone realizes that this movie is based on a book about a REAL battle in a REAL war with characters based on REAL people who died.  Of course, it has been fictionalized and dramatized, but isn't it trivializing the deaths of these young men to even refer to their celluloid depictions as ""cliches?""  What we see may be just a movie, but a whole lot of American soldiers died for what some might say was no good reason. Nothing will change that.

Anyway, this film's extraordinary aerial camera shots of the battle scenes and Gibson's ability to take a leadership role once again surely earn this movie some Academy Award nominations.<br/><br/>This film can be disturbing to some, I understand that.  But even if you don't care for it, you have to admit that it puts you inside the battle, like you are standing there with the soldiers as they fight for us.  This film's picture is clear and understandable.  The movie also does not pull out of the fighting for too long.  This is a very emotional movie, with some really good performances.  I think Sam Elliot should get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor due to his grandpa-like humor towards the men.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie, take it from me, you WILL be entertained and educated by it.

"schak23","2","4","10","8 February 2007"," too simple
","It's hard to accept, that so many viewers think so positive about that movie. The main aim of the movie maker is simple to read: to win a war America already lost. The truth is that Vietnam was a disaster, but one should not consider it as a military disaster which has to be rewritten by such simple stories. It's better to understand that war itself is a disaster even if it is a war which seems to be necessary. But the film shows the opposite. The film depicts the war and especially the enemies like John Wayne did it in The Green Berets and it's a horrible image of the US army having leading soldiers like the figure of Moore. What's it like to be a father and a soldier Geoghegan asks (in a church!)and the only thing Moore has to answer is that God should help him to kill that other b...... . Is that reality? And is it authentic to show thousands of running and screaming Vietnamese soldiers like those guys we saw in the 50s and 60s? It maybe a realistic depiction according to some of the quoted veterans here in the user comments. I don't blame those, but please don't forget: It is nothing more than a single event, a single perspective, a film and a story. I prefer to understand a war movie as something mono-dimensional about a complex truth. Wallace and Gibson say nothing more but: Vietnam, Politics, doubts, sorrow, pain and grief? Ah, come on, f... it. They Were Soldiers and they were heroes, there's nothing more to say. I have only one word for that: propaganda. I really do hope that the whole American society doesn't think like Wallace and Gromit, sorry, Gibson. But there is still a spark of hope in the war film genre. Thank's, Clint. Some flaws, but many opportunities for contemplation about something that is not simple to understand."

Let us begin with Mel Gibson and his accent. What part of the country he is supposed to be from, I am not sure. Then there is the geography of Vietnam, which looks a lot like Central Texas. I swear I saw numerous Texas Live Oaks. I don't want to be too picky here, but Vietnam (any tropical country) does not resemble this terrain at all. Then you have the NVA troops that all like to run right up to our American boys without firing their weapons. Our boys shoot them as they run with their AK 47's in hand. Now that is just bad training. If the NVA had only known how to actually fire a weapon, they might have won this war. Hey, wait a minute, they did win this war. Other acting performance were shallow and undeveloped.<br/><br/>Look, it is no shock why this film is accepted.

Col. Hal Moore is the commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry and the same regiment fatefully led by George Armstrong Custer. As part of the Pleiku Campaign of late 1965, Moore is assigned to an action at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Drang Valley, an area that would come to be known as the ""The Valley of Death."" He soon finds himself and his men contained to an area about the size of a football field, surrounded by more than 2,000 enemy troops and engaged in the first major battle of the war. Heroism becomes the order of the day as men like Moore, chopper pilot Bruce Crandall, and Lt. Henry Herrick refuse to yield, in spite of heavy losses of life. <br/><br/>We Were Soldiers is a fitting tribute to all the men and women who have fought and died for their country and for each other.The war genre does that by taking several steps backward with this old-fashioned moralistic saga and by doing a much better job of establishing the characters before they plunge into battle.Also,despite of the violence it portrays on screen,it has a good story and an important message that it wants to impart to the viewer."
"the-bloodless-conspiracy","8","2","4","9 January 2010"," -insert positive review title-
","To all the people who gave this movie negative reviews, I ask you- did you even watch this movie? If the answer to that is yes, I have to wonder exactly what rock you've been living under, that you have no idea how human beings work.<br/><br/>Let's take a look at some of the criticism we've seen here:<br/><br/>1- 'It's clich√©!' Some of the clich√©s cited- Hal Moore is too perfect, the Americans are all heroes, the housewives are all good little housewives.<br/><br/>On Hal Moore being 'too perfect', don't be stupid. People like that actually exist. I know a few who come very close. I myself come pretty damn close, except I'm not married. The kids I devote my time to, pray with, and try to teach real-world concepts to are someone else's. If a real four-to-six-year-old child asked you what war was, what exactly would you tell her? If it's anything more specific and gruesome than what the movie said, I'd have to wonder about your judgment and rethink ever leaving a child that young in your care.<br/><br/>Next, the Americans are all heroes. Yes, because charging off against orders, getting your platoon cut off from the main body of soldiers, and getting most of your men killed by running after obvious bait into an obvious trap is very heroic. And of course, we all look up to and idolize pilots who accidentally bomb their own lines and get their own soldiers killed or severely wounded.<br/><br/>And yes, the above paragraph should be read with the heaviest infliction of sarcasm you can manage.<br/><br/>And oh, my God, a movie that takes place in the 60s actually has housewives acting like they would in the 60s. How dare Hollywood. How dare they.<br/><br/>2- 'Nobody says stupid things like 'tell my wife I love her' when they're dying!'<br/><br/>Anyone saying this has obviously never thought they were going to die. As someone who has come close to dying - five times - I can tell you without embarrassment or shame that the only thought on my mind all five times was the fear that I didn't tell and show the dearest person to me (my little sister) how much I loved her. I wasn't thinking of how much it hurt, how scared I was, why I was in those situations. All I could think was 'Did I do enough to show Diana how much I love her? Does she know how much I owe her, how much I care about her, how grateful I am for all she's done for me?' And if what is nearest and dearest to a person is their country, I have no trouble believing that their sacrifice in said country's name would be uppermost in their mind. When we as human beings think we're about to die, our minds turn to the things that are most important to us. To a husband and father, that's likely his family. For me, it's my sister, who's the only person I actually think of as family. For a true dyed-in-the-wool patriot, that would most definitely be his country.<br/><br/>3- 'It's pro-Vietnam!'<br/><br/>No, it's not. It even comes right out and says, through the mouth of a Vietnamese soldier, that America going into Vietnam didn't change anything- it only made the body count higher. How is a movie that flat-out says a war did nothing but get a lot of people needlessly killed support said war?<br/><br/>4- 'It pushes religion!'<br/><br/>Religious people pray. Get over it.<br/><br/>And please, take note of who leaves what kind of review here. I couldn't help but notice that not a single Vietnam vet who left a review for this movie had anything bad to say about it. Think- the people who fought in the war this movie depicts can only praise it. That tells you something."

The pacing is solid. The acting is invariably powerful. The characters, if not as interesting or engaging as they could be, are well-written. An awful lot of the way, this is credible. The action is well-done. The FX are incredible. The editing and cinematography are excellent, no exceptions. The use of slow-motion is effective in each case. There are some beautifully cut sequences herein. There is considerable violence, gore and disturbing content. This is evidently very authentic, but it does seem to give up trying for that near the end, and adds to the list of Hollywood moments, otherwise so short that it could almost be completely ignored, and introduces a deus ex machina(for those unaware, that's when you discover that you've written yourself into a corner, and decides to just throw in something that had not been built towards and which isn't necessarily even a little likely or plausible) of about the same level as Saving Private Ryan... the difference being that I felt I got more out of watching that than this, and what it all comes down to is that I doubt I'll miss owning this, as it only aired on TV, as opposed to aforementioned title, which I'm glad to be able to borrow from my father. It should be noted that this does show the Viet Cong without particularly demonizing or dehumanizing them. It is, however, clear who the film-makers were intending to support and honor.

","If you are an aficionado of war movies, you've certainly seen it done better than this, but We Were Soldiers has it's moments. It's hard to cite any individual thing that I didn't like about the movie, but it just doesn't seem to all come together quite right. There are numerous moments that feel desperately clich√©. Some of the writing is downright horrible. We don't really get to know any of the characters very well. The battles rarely carry any real suspense, save for the scenes of the few soldiers trapped in behind enemy lines. The whole movie has this air of sentimentality to it that just doesn't work. The makers also opted to include numerous scenes of the North Vietnamese soldiers. Clearly the filmmakers were attempting to add some humanity to the enemy, but they weren't very effective. The scenes felt tacked on, and didn't really add anything to the experience other than serving the minor purpose of allowing the audience to formulate that Gibson's character was anticipating the enemy's actions so we know we are supposed to be in awe of his leadership. It's a lot of things like that which just made the movie feel like it was spoon-feeding every step of the way. All in all, it's not a horrible movie. But, it probably could have been great, and it falls well short of that mark. It is a relatively generic war movie, and fans of the genre will probably be satisfied. However, it certainly isn't a great piece of film-making."

","My late husband, a West Point graduate, was in VN in 1965 as an adviser to the South Vietnamese Army. He received 2 Bronze Medals with the V device as well as the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman's Badge & several awards from the VN government. He cared deeply for the Vietnamese people with whom he lived that year, and was proud to have served. He was there just before this battle occurred.<br/><br/>When the movies about Viet Nam started coming out, he was horrified by the way they depicted the war & he refused to see most of them. ""We Were Soldiers"" was made after his death in 2001. I went to see it alone because I had the feeling this one would be different. It was, & I cried when it was over because Sam wasn't there to see it with me. That was the Army he knew, not the Army of ""Platoon"". Among other criticisms,he said he never saw drugs being used AT ALL during his year there. <br/><br/>I have a friend who served with Col. Moore (later to become a General) & he has talked with him about the movie & the book from which it was made. Moore said the the movie was at least 85% factual, the way it really was. And Joe Galloway, the reporter, also has said that it was well-done. He has been back to VN in the last few years and actually met with the officer who was leading the North Vietnamese they were fighting. They shook hands & the General said to Galloway ""I'm glad I did not kill you.""<br/><br/>As for people thinking that ""Platoon"" is THE factual movie on that sad war, yes Oliver Stone was there. When the movie was seen by the veteran who was Stone's Company Commander at the time, he was enraged. (This comes from an American Legion Magazine). He called Stone & asked ""Where the ""bleep"" did you get all that stuff you put in the movie? It's not fair to misrepresent our guys that way."" Stone's reply was that he took dramatic license. <br/><br/>In closing, I'll just say that I have not spoken with a single VN vet who was not supportive of ""We Were Soldiers"".

","As I write this, the weighted score for this movie is 6.9, and I find that unbelievable.<br/><br/>Every other Vietnam film I've seen (Full Metal Jacket, Good Morning Vietnam, Platoon, etc.) has painted the Vietnam war to be a messy, failed ""police operation,"" the US government to be a bunch of overstretched bureaucrats, and of course, war itself to be hell. Yeah, we get it. Thanks. How about something that actually honors those that fought and gave their lives for the ideals of our great country? Besides this movie, no other film I've seen has done so. This is the story the world missed when we heard about Vietnam, and it's time the stories of our veterans were respected. We Were Soldiers is the story of the first US troops that landed in Vietnam and of their leader. The film is an amazingly close and personal account of our first encounter on Vietnam soil, and it's beautifully and methodically executed. It makes the viewer feel the strategic tension of the first hours of operation from a commander's viewpoint, and from the soldiers' viewpoints.<br/><br/>Looking over the demographic spread of voters, I'm glad to see 45+ years voting this so highly. I'm glad that the generation that remembers our country during the war, itself, considers this film so highly. The rest of us should too."

","On November 8, 1965, during Operation Hump in War Zone D in South Vietnam, the 173rd Airborne Brigade were ambushed by over 1200 Viet Cong guerrillas. 48 American soldiers and over 400 of the enemy lost their lives on that fateful day. <br/><br/>The country duo, Big & Rich, wrote and performed a wonderful song relating to this film, which appears on their album, Comin' To Your City. The title is, ""THE 8TH OF November.""-- The songwriters stated, ""This is a true story about a man we are honored to know. His name is Niles Harris of Deadwood, SD. He is one of just four of the thirty men from his 2nd Platoon of Charlie Company who survived when over 1200 Vietcong ambushed the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Every word of that song had to say so much. This song is one of the biggest things we've been a part of and one of the most enlightening.""<br/><br/>The lyrics go like this: <br/><br/>Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota to fight for the red, white and blue. He was 19 and green, with a new M-16, just doing what he had to do. He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble with the smell of napalm in the air. And the sergeant said...look up ahead, like a dark evil cloud, 1200 came down on him, and 29 more. They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne.<br/><br/>Chorus:<br/><br/>On the 8th of November the angels were crying as they carried his brothers away. With the fire raining down, and the hell all around, there were few men left standing that day. Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky, 1965, the 8th of November.<br/><br/>Now he's 58, and his pony tail's gray, but the battle still plays in his head. He limps when he walks, but he's strong when he talks, about the shrapnel they left in his leg. He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo, and he ties it on one time a year. And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one, and swallows it down with his tears.<br/><br/>Chorus:<br/><br/>Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky, 1965. On the 8th of November, the angels were crying as they carried his brothers away. With the fire raining down, and the hell all around, there were few men left standing that day.<br/><br/>Chorus:<br/><br/>Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota to fight for the red, white and blue.

This movie also shows - more clearly than other war stories - why wars become so important and tragic, not only from a nationalistic but, perhaps more importantly, from an individual's or a family's viewpoint.<br/><br/>The only thing that disturbs me is that this movie has a biased political tone in it, which maybe was not intentional, but that nevertheless is there, seen with European eyes anyway.

","""We Were Soldiers,"" stars Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore and was directed by Randall Wallace; A great American War film, filled with action, adventure, love and war. In this film Mel Gibson leads the very first group of some 400 American men into a hot zone where 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers are waiting. During this battle excessive gun fights, devotion of friendship, and love was shown. This movie is different from other Vietnam War films. It shows the emotional battle of war not only in battle, but for the loved ones waiting in anticipation back at home; praying and longing to see there loved ones once more. Madeleine Stowe (Julie Moore), as Gibson's (Lt. Col. Hal Moore) wife played a crucial part in this film; waiting everyday for that yellow cab, and that one letter, that one letter that says; ""were sorry, for the loss of your loved one."" Instead of letting the wives of the honored men see that yellow cab pull up in front of their house, Gibson's wife and friend decide to deliver the messages themselves. Not only is this movie an action filled, dramatic war film, but it also tells a story of a brave young photographer (Joe Galloway) who captured actual images of what really happened, who eventually wrote a book on what drama he had experienced."

","There have probably been more films concerning Vietnam then any other US war. We Were Soldiers is the re-accounting of the first major US battle of the Vietnam war. Col.

Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliot), Maj. Snake Candall (Greg Kinnear), and Reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper). Along with the story of the soldiers we receive of the stories of the wives trying to deal with the loss of their husbands. Hal Moore's wife, Julie (Madeline Stowe) puts it upon herself to deliver the death letters to the soldiers wives. the scene in which Julie and Barbara are delivering the letters is one of the best scenes of the film. <br/><br/>The film is 90% battle with breaks here and there. The death of some of the soldiers is very graphic and when the napalm accidentally hits the US soldiers, you almost need to turn away as soldiers skin is falling off. <br/><br/>Gibson gives another solid job as a soldier, Greg Kinnear brings some humor but not enough to hide what is being shown. The film is visually stunning and the battles are well done and graphic. <br/><br/>We Were Soldiers.

"patches-4","9","2","4","20 March 2005"," We Were Soldiers is an early Viet Nam War film
","I'm afraid I have to disagree with a few of the comments made by previous reviewers.<br/><br/>One thing we should remember most importantly is that the story, as mentioned in the film, is about the first major engagement between the American military and the NVA. <br/><br/>Someone made a comment about some of the 'cliched' lines, i.e. ""Tell my wife I love her"" ""We'll give them hell"" and ""I'm glad I died for my country"". What we should also remember is that in the early years and at the time the film is set the combat soldier honestly believed that what he was fighting was a war that America could win and that he was defending Viet Nam and the West from Communism and that they were doing the right thing. It was only really later that opinions changed about the war. As I'm ex-forces myself I can assure anyone who doubts the things people say when they are in danger that they are true. <br/><br/>I think Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore and Sam Elliott as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley portray well the kind of leadership and inspiration that took those young combat soldiers into the hell of Ia Drang and it is a tribute to those men who experienced it for real.<br/><br/>This film and a few others are based on fact and real incidents so we have the written accounts and the films military advisers to rely on to bring reality to the screen. <br/><br/>With regards one reviewers comments about the wives, both American and NVA, in the story, I don't see any problem with this. At least we see the affect it has on those back home. The comparisons between the American wives looking after their own and the men looking out for each other is exactly how it is in real life, what's wrong with that?<br/><br/>In this film we see the affect this one battle had on the men and women affected by it and that would sadly be repeated many, many times before the Viet Nam War ended and sadly is now being repeated in Iraq.<br/><br/>One final thing I think we should read: smilovich from United States Reviewer: Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"" (Biloxi, MS USA) comments about this film to ascertain whether this is a good film or not."
"mxracer157","8","2","4","18 March 2005"," the glory and the horror of war all wrapped into one
","Fantastic. The tail of the 1st major American battle in Vietnam. Extremely well written script. Perhaps the best Vietnam movie ever written. Most movies only tell things from one side. some show two sides if the script is decent. This movie shows this point of view of this time from three different perspectives. one part is the US soldiers point of view. Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in his acting in this film. Watching Mel question his own orders, then watching him give orders himself and then wonder if they were right shows a scene few movies have ever reached upon. Vietnam wasn't a well received time period in the US history. This movie shows soldiers dealing with each other, becoming more than just platoon buddies. The next point of view was the point of the wives of the US soldiers. When their men had left, they stayed strong. Madelaine Stowe plays a perfect wife in this film. You can actually see and feel her heartbreak as she lets her new found friends know their husbands had died. The final point of view from this movie was the VC point of view. the Colonel of the VC army,played by Don Duong is a wonderful job. This movie has other actors in it that most will recognize .Chris Klein does a wonderful job as a new father and husband off to war for the 1st time. Kerri Russel totally escapes her ""Felicity"" role as she portrays a young mother who loses her husband but remains a loyal friend. Sam Elliott plays a tough old SGT out to keep his Colonel alive. IN his older years now, Elliot often lands roles needing a mature strong man, and he does it well! The final actor in this movie most will know is Greg Kinnear. Escaping his comedy roots, Greg plays a wily helicopter pilot. Kinnear doesn't say much, but his acting is a nice job in this story. The finest acting in this film in my opinion though is Barry Pepper who plays the Newspaper man. He comes from a military family but wants to understand the war so he acts as a novelist. Seeing the anguish Pepper goes through as he figures out he either starts killing or ends up being killed is tough. Watching him wonder what is going to happen next almost makes you feel as if you are there with him yourself. a fantastic movie. lot of action and blood,so if your not into that, this movie isn't for you. But a very well directed, acted and written movie, the best I have seen in a long time!"
"kuziaks","10","2","4","26 February 2005"," excellent depiction but its lenght denied the rest of the story
","An outstanding example of the ineptitude of higher command and how the political nature of the war denied the American soldier the finest combat leaders possible. One Reviewer cites deviations from the actual story line that does not really detract from the authenticity of the whole endeavor. The effects of the Armys inability to properly inform next of kin was dramatically displayed. The emphasis was placed on the courage of the American soldier and the outstanding leadership displayed by all the officers involved in the units directly involved in the battle. Combat scenes very realistically portrayed the near hopelessness of the American situation, and how Army higher commands main concern was avoiding possible embarrassment. The only negative was the failure to demonstrate how the forces sent to relieve the surrounded Forces were decimated upon their return march back to the main base. The hubris of the subsequent command was discussed in the book, needlessly causing the death of hundreds of American soldiers. A good example of how ring knockers priority is not the soldier but their own personal advancement."

","A brilliant war movie by anyone's standards. I heard that this movie would make Saving Private Ryan look like Dad's Army. I doubted that very much, SPR had realism unlike any other war film, in it's time, SPR was the best and only realistic war movie out there. It was revolutionary, and I just knew that We Were Soldiers could not live up to the same standards. WWS had little hype before it's release, especially when compared to SPR. How terribly wrong I was. WWS surpasses SPR in every department. In this movie, we get a feel for the REAL horrors of war. This film is not for the faint hearted, but if you want to see and learn about war, you need to watch this film. The film starts slowly, I admit that, and it takes a while for the Air Cavalry to get to Vietnam, but once the action starts, it never stops. The action scenes are VERY long. The action takes over three days and we see small scale and large scale skirmishes between the to forces. We are taken from one platoon to another, and there are no gung ho running about the place. The soldiers keep their heads down and stay down, firing in short controlled bursts as they should.<br/><br/>However, at one point, there seems to be a hell of a lot of explosions, which I believe was only done for the camera and for action's sake.<br/><br/>But one tactic that is used is to build up character profiles and personalities, which are then systematically destroyed as we see grisly depictions of their death. We think, because of their good nature, that they will make it through, when in fact they do not. The film would not be as moving if it was not for the musicians. The slow, mournful music adds to the despair and carnage, perhaps bringing a tear to the eye of the viewer. A deeply moving story, which is worth another viewing by you."

If you are looking for a movie that will allow you to experience emotions that very few movies can bring out, watch this movie, it has similar impact to Saving Private Ryan, or Black Hawk Down.

The plan is to fly in with helicopter, and eventually pull out by helicopter. However their landing zone is very close to an Vietnamese base camp and the battle is soon raging.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I have no personal experience of being in battle, so I can only speculate. The movie is based on an actual battle and I gather that it is pretty accurate. Still, the story is told as a movie and has to be folded into this format. I guess this leads to some details and subplots (thankfully) has been omitted. Many other movies may try this way and one hand can get more dominant than the other, i.e. a dull documentary or a pure war-fiction with no reality anchor. To be sure, there are a lot of effects in WWS as well, but they never go overboard with them. The story and the characters are always in focus.<br/><br/>By doing it this way, we get to both see an entertaining movie (for us who likes war action that is) but at the same time glimpse the horrors of battle. There were really disturbing images, for example some badly burned soldiers whose skin just fell of, that made my stomach turn. Thankfully they were rather few and apart with more ""normal"" blood spill and splatter in between. Also we get an glimpse of the horrors the soldiers-wives has to live through, uncertainty and grief, as the notifications of their dead husbands are delivered to the wives by a cab company. It is also good to note, even if we mostly see the American perspective, that the Viatnamese command and soldiers is portrayed as soldiers as well. They just happen to ""on the other side of the fence.""<br/><br/>To conclude things, an entertaining docu-action with glimpses of a scary reality.<br/><br/>8/10"
"hitchs","9","2","4","8 July 2004"," One of the best war films ever.
","I find it hard to believe the incredible amount of hostility to this movie and the many criticisms of it, most of which are either absurdly nit-picking or just plain false.<br/><br/>It is easy to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that America's whole involvement in Vietnam was a huge mistake, but the victory of the North caused a tremendous amount of suffering, unhappiness and loss of freedom, and still does. I'm not going to comment on the politics or history of the war, because obviously a lot of other people know much more about these issues than I do. But as a piece of cinema, and as a comment on war in general, the film is superb.<br/><br/>Certainly the battle scenes were some of the most gruesome ever filmed. Perhaps they were over the top, but surely they are more true than the old movies where everybody died cleanly, with a minimum of pain, and frequently had time to speak their last will and testament before they signed out by closing their eyes.<br/><br/>What I loved was the human dimension. Some critics have complained about the depiction of men having babies just before they go to war and get killed, but the fact is that it happened. After all, these were young men, many of them were married, and it was the time of the baby boom. I loved the intercutting between the battle field and the women back home. Sure it was excessively emotional, but if you can't get emotional about the waste of lives in war, then I think you have a serious problem. It was also great to see them humanise the enemy, particularly in the bit about the man who was killed after writing a letter to his wife or girlfriend. Is this racist? Don't be absurd.<br/><br/>Is it propaganda? Well, it seems that if you disagree with the views expressed in a book or film, it is propaganda, while if you agree, it is honest, probing, important, etc. I certainly didn't agree with all the opinions expressed in We Were Soldiers. I think the policy of sending men to their deaths in order to bring back the bodies of those already dead is insanity, and I don't believe the use of napalm is ever justified. But this movie is not in any sense propaganda. It is possibly unrealistic in the sense that it is dramatised, not documentary, but it is a very honest portrayal of real men and women trying to cope with a real, ghastly situation."

","I'd put this movie right in the middle between Deer Hunter and Black Hawk Down. That's because it includes a view of the social side back home, like seen in Deer Hunter and it shows the utter carnage of war, like in Black Hawk Down. This movie ties well together those two different sides, it shows the suffering at home and on the battlefield. It shows also at least a little bit the side of the enemy, which is something you don't really see often. This movie doesn't make war look cool, like sadly some other American Vietnam movies do, nor does it take away from the ""real"" feeling. While watching you'll see soldiers die left and right, getting hit by bullets, burnt by fire and it all seems very real and horrifying and you can feel the loss. To follow the structure and progress of the battle is not all too easy, but I believe that it isn't either when you are there, in fact if I'd been fighting in such a place I'd been surprised if I'd been able to make any much sense of it!<br/><br/>A true war drama! 9/10"

"CCS-CRITIC","Null","2","4","2 November 2003"," A quite competent and watchable war drama
","WE WERE SOLDIERS **1/2<br/><br/>Vietnam was a horrifying militaristic blunder.  American governmental officials thought the operation would be an efficient and effective strategy, only to discover resistance of the strongest kind under the guise of the Vietnamese Communist founder Ho Chi Minh.  After the first confrontations, America eventually joined the fray to eradicate the problems in Vietnam.  They were wrong.  In the movie, the Viet-Cong military leader opposed to Gibson's company said something along the lines of ¬ëthe Americans will think that they've won this war', something that held some gravity. Gibson plays a leader of a company that will land at la Drang and assess the problems.  The opening sequences focus more on the emotional build-up to the war through the eyes of the companies' wives and girlfriends and the grief that they carry that their loved ones will be going to war. <br/><br/>
The crux of the movie shows the horrific action involving the company landing in Vietnam and the Viet Cong that are protecting their mother land. The results were horrifying.  Needless deaths with little or no plan, with hundreds slaughtered after being surrounded by the Viet Cong.  The movie was sound, with it giving a good overall portrayal of the brutalities of war. However, after watching previous movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line and Platoon the brilliant action sequences with bullets flying to all parts and the brutal kill shots now look a little more ordinary. <br/><br/>
One of the most emotional sequences of the movie involved Gibson's wife (played by Stowe).  A taxi would regularly come and go in the vicinity were the wives lived, which turned out to be the fateful taxi that would give the worst possible information that a member of the company had died.  The driver one day walks up to Stowe's house and looking rather grim, fidgets with an envelope.  Stowe awaits the news beginning to cry.  He announces that he's looking for Stowe because he wants to know where another woman lives.  The impact was tremendous.  She shouts at the forlorn man 'Did you know what you did to me then', before the man starts walking away apologetically.  He stops and almost in a whimper suggests that he doesn't like doing the job, but he's just trying to do it the best he can.  Stowe then takes on the responsibility by telling the man that all envelopes from that day forward would be delivered to her.  Moments like that in the movie will probably bring a tear to the eye.  Stowe's response, and the isolation of a man just trying to do a simple job in the worst circumstances.   <br/><br/>
But if the emotional study was excellent, the war combat scenes were a little unbelievable.  Not in a sloppy way by no means, but for me something didn't click.  That may be my problem and not yours.  From the Patriot and Braveheart, I believed in Gibson's performance.  But I didn't believe in him much here.  As the movie progressed he got better and better, but the early damage whereby I thought he was going to break out into a ¬ëWhat Women Want' comic sketch set the tone.  Overall the film is worth a watch, but it didn't show me anything new.  Maybe it's because the impact of the aforementioned war films was so great because they were the first to show what war is truly like, and that any films after these would have to show something different and diverse otherwise I just take it for granted."

","""We Were Soldiers"" is an excellent war movie and an excellent film, period. It is meticulously researched and based on a fine book of the same title. Read that book, and you will understand that A) the U.S. filming locations ARE realistic in portraying the Central Vietnam Highlands and that B) many of the ""corny"" or ""sentimental"" events of the film are straight from the actual battle and have been religiously incorporated into the movie. If WWS isn't clever and ironic enough for some viewers, well, Platoon wasn't very hip, clever or ironic, either, and this movie would serve as a good introduction to that film. Mel Gibson's performance here ranks with his passionate, zesty work in Braveheart. He is never anything less than convincing, and yet for a larger-than-life role, he never comes across as an invincible hero or a superstar. Frankly, I forgot that I was watching Mel Gibson and simply accepted him as Col. Hal Moore. One of the best movies of the year, if not the best movie of the year."
"SILV3R","8","2","4","19 September 2002"," Mel Gibson war movie.
","The whole movie is based around the battle which apparently started the Vietnam war (so a worthy subject to dramatise). Its a war movie with the usual Gibson sentiment, but despite the occasional Americana its very good. The battle scenes are amazing, with some originality thrown in for a change, not just old hat war stuff. Brilliantly filmed as you would imagine, and the CGI effects are kept to an apparent minimum (clearly they are there otherwise there would be a massive drop in the extras available in Hollywood).<br/><br/>There is at least an attempt to explain why the war happened, although it is far from satisfactory. There is even an attempt to show that the ""enemy"" really aren't any different from US. The script is not Oscar worthy, but at least its not the usual cliches we associate with war movies. The cliches are there, but they are few and far between. The story has no massive surprises as its not that kind of film. Its about the battle. People die, people survive. Its more about the sensation of war that is forced upon you.<br/><br/>I confess to watching this with the intent of not liking it. I generally don't like Americans doing war movies. This surprised me however by being a good movie. Gibson's performance is very much Braveheart with a gun, but as a starting block, there are worst characters to imitate. The biggest problem is that you leave wondering just how much of the story is true. It is after all an American film about war, based on a novel (We Were Soldiers Once...And Young) by an American guy who was in the battle, released at a time when America is at a war of sorts and needs something positive to lift them.<br/><br/>A good movie which would have been great accept for my own cynicism."
"n3yfr341","9","2","4","25 August 2002"," We Were Soldiers Definitely
","I have to definitely have to recommend this movie.  Having been an avid Vietnam War movie fanatic in the 1980's Vietnam War films such as Full Metal Jacket, Hanoi Hilton which portrayed the grittier side of the war, this was a change of pace.  Col. Hal Moore's WE WERE SOLDIERS shows the human side of the soldiers and their families and what they all went through during this time.  I also have note the performance of Sam Elliot, as Sgt.Major Plumley, this made it worth watching.  I should leave out Mel Gibson's role of Col. Hal Moore.  Academy shouldn't ignore this film come Academy Award nomination time"
"matthew-waring","Null","2","4","13 August 2002"," Read the book first - then see the film - highly recommended
","A few hints at the content of the film (and not a book review):-<br/><br/>Having read the book, and now just caught the film, I'm surprised by the amount of negative comments regarding the film.<br/><br/>I suggest people read the book to understand that things were a lot different in 1965, to '67-'75 - I'm sure that Authors Lt Gen Harold Moore and Joseph L. Galloway did not exaggerate the gung ho sprit of the WWII and Korean veterans who took part in the fight at Ia Drang, nor the greenness showed by the 18-20 year olds, and whose lack of combat experience was reflected in either action or lack of it (and that goes for some of the first time Lieutenants).<br/><br/>The leaders in this battle, the aircrews, and the ordinary infantry soldier (if there could be such a thing) did what they thought right, there was no thought of not following orders, nor of being in peek physical fitness, or not wanting to help your fellow soldier. The issues and feelings that later arose during the last 6 odd years of the Vietnam War, rightly, got a lot of people thinking, and that includes the soldier asked to go die for their country.<br/><br/>But that was later.<br/><br/>In 1965 America was still experiencing a growth and prosperity not seen since the turn of the century, and at this time people still went to church, aspired to have the perfect wife and family complete with picket fence around the yard and would un-questionably die for their country - this was reflected in the high standards expected of the US Army, and by the Majors and Generals asked to lead and set the standards during the early stages of the Vietnam War (please don't think I'm saying that the US army does not now have high standards - of course it does - high standards set, in part, due to the terrible price paid in Vietnam).<br/><br/>Of course war is futile - a message that should be told as many times as possible, in as many different ways, maybe then we and our rulers/leaders/statesmen/stateswomen will listen.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the film, because I highly recommend the power of the book - go read, go see."
"tristanm81","Null","2","4","10 July 2002"," maybe worse than ""the patriot""
","Well I never liked Braveheart much, and very much disliked The Patriot. This film was sort of the next in the series I guess. Credit to the special effects- fairly realistic I would imagine. The story was true, I guess, so can't be criticised. But the film was difficult to watch, it view of the war was very much skewed- no disrespect to the American casualties -but a lot of Vietnamese died as well, the film only half made an effort to show this. I felt that dealing with religion in the film was out of place -and badly done. Also, dealing with racism was done rather too obviously, with an apparently spontaneous speech from one of the wives. All in all, too many speeches -every time a soldier spoke, it was a profound statement -and the american flag perhaps featured too much for the international audience. Considering the main character was also the books author, I was a bit doubtful about the films accuracy because he (Mel Gibson) was some sort of superhero in the film. It would have been better if someone else told the story. Not a classic by any means."

The directing of Randall Wallace does what it should: puts you in the battle. Wallace also penned the script which is sensitive and to the point. This film shows how the soldiers fought for each other, rather than some cause. Walking out of the theater you are lost for words and proud to be an American."
"BobakUSC","Null","2","4","5 March 2002"," Great battle scenes make up for lackluster script.
","The first thing I noticed in ""We Were Soldiers"" is that, even under intense enemy fire -with soldiers being shot and maimed and the situation seeming completely bleak, not one person started cursing.  I can't remember the last modern Vietnam movie that had soldiers with a rated PG vocabulary. Fortunately, the realism of the grisly combat scenes more than makes up for the hokey screenplay -especially in the first third of the movie.<br/><br/>How hokey is the beginning?  The scene that stands out the most (not a spoiler in any way) takes place early in the film: The soldiers' wives are gathered together (in picture perfect period dress) talking about issues on the base (in a manner that says ""life is perfect, so are we"").  What a shock it is to them, when they hear the local laundry mat is segregated!  They all look to the -one- African-American female in the room who goes off on a patriotic speech about how her and her husband believe and America and fight for the ideals we all hold dear. ... Well, that's lovely -if this were a movie about the complexities of the African-American experience in Vietnam (like ""Dead Presidents"" or ""The Walking Dead""), instead what we have is a scene shoe-horned so badly that it elicited nothing but groans in a cosmopolitan audience.  Then again, Randall Wallace is both Writer and Director... (Wallace also wrote Pearl Harbor)<br/><br/>When you have a bad script, its up to the actors to work with it, and I must say that Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, and Greg Kinnear all give their plastic lines believability.  Gibson's role is particularly well played as the Hal Moore, an educated, religious family man who has a knack for battlefield leadership (the real Moore wrote the book which Wallace adapted).  Elliot is a scene stealer as a cliche-ridden Sergeant-Major who's ultra-tough demeanor gives the movie some of its biggest laughs.<br/><br/>Once the movie steps into Vietnam, the movie starts to achieve something. The battles are brutally realistic.  People get shot to pieces, burned alive, blood is everywhere -life really starts to mean very little when bullets fly through the air.  The sheer intensity of the violence gives the movie its impact, a comparison to Saving Private Ryan would not be out of line.  In a way, it gives the movie an unintended thematic arch:  The movie begins as a somewhat sappy, patriotic march for America, but by the end of the battle the brutality and carnage of 3 days under fire makes the earlier bravado seem naive.  I believe a little bit of ""change-of-heart"" was intended (after all, this was the first major US engagement in what turned out to be a living nightmare), but not the level that the actual movie creates.  I can't imagine anyone who would see ""We Were Soldiers"" and decide to join the fighting forces.  Mel Gibson may have seemed like a noble fellow, but those battle scenes showed hell on earth.  Kudos to all those involved in crafting the battle scenes.<br/><br/>Still, incredible battle scenes and likable performances can only do so much.  In the case of ""We Were Soldiers,"" they make the movie very watchable, and recommendable -as long as you're not expecting screenwriting excellence.<br/><br/>One final, positive note: The film goes out of its way to portray the North Vietnamese not as barbaric monsters but rather as determined, intelligent opponents.  It even dedicates itself to both American and N. Vietnamese fighting forces.  The attempt, while not totally seemless, deserves acknowledgment."

","We Were Soldiers reteamed Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace after working on Braveheart and I personally think it was a better film then the Scottish set epic.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers told the story of the first major battle the American Army were a part of. The strenghts of the film were it's focus on the preparation before deployment and focus on battle tactics as commanders react to events on the field with Hal Moore (Gibson) and the North Vietnamese commander (Don Duong) playing a deadly game of chess. It's great for history and military nerds. Unlike Braveheart Wallace did try to be more balance with the Vietnamese soldiers being protrayed as men fighting for their country or have families back home. It was also a brutal depiction of war: Wallace and his team went to great effort to show how horrible warfare can be and the types of injuries soldiers can suffers.<br/><br/>There were some problems. Except for Gibson, Sam Elliott, and Barry Pepper most of the American cast blended together when on the battlefield. The action on the homefront was so sugary and sappy it could you diabetes."

"cashbacher","10","0","0","25 April 2020"," The start of Americanization of the Vietnam War
","This is a powerful movie in many aspects. The first is the dramatic war action where the combat deaths of thousands of men are depicted. It is brutal, savage and unforgiving, just as close quarter combat is. The second is the undercurrent of how the U. S. military made some colossal mistakes in its prosecution of the war. The battle being depicted is one where the new style of American cavalry, flying into combat on helicopters, is being developed. The third aspect is the home front, where the wives of the men in the unit are being notified of their deaths in combat by telegram delivered by a cabdriver.
Mel Gibson plays U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, the leader of a battalion being trained for air cavalry operations. He is also an academic and has studied the massacre of a French unit by the Viet Minh in 1954. He is determined to avoid the mistakes of the French, where they did not know the terrain and had no intelligence regarding the strength of the opposing forces.
When Moore's 400 man unit is dropped into an area where an American base has been attacked, the American commanders have no idea regarding the number of enemy forces in the area. When a soldier of the North Vietnamese Army is captured, he reveals that the immediate area is the base for a unit of over 4,000 men. Immediately understanding their predicament, Moore prepares his men for a major battle. The action is fierce, yet the Americans hold on, largely due to the American aerial firepower. Orders come down that make no sense to Moore and he ignores them.
This movie is based on the battle of Ia Trang Valley, the first major engagement between U. S. forces and those of North Vietnam. In terms of casualties, it was an American victory, as nearly 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed. Yet, it was a learning experience for the North Vietnamese commanders, from that point they realized that they must proceed with caution in engaging in a major battle with U. S. forces. The ability of American commanders to call in devastating air strikes meant that anything approaching a siege was suicide.
This movie also depicts what was one of the primary U. S. tactics. Occupy a region, engage in a firefight, hold it for awhile and then pull out. It was not a war where both sides moved forces along a front in order to expand the territory that they controlled. The ending is powerful as it shows Moore walking up to the section of the Vietnam Memorial wall where the names of the fallen of his unit are etched in stone."

It was a graphical movie, but just enough so as to show the ugly sides of military conflict carried out in the most direct, closest range form. The performances were not stellar, but they shouldn't have been either, so that we are not left with how impressed we were with acting, but with how cruel reality was and is for some, but also with how if you are faced with such a reality, you must fight for your country and, beyond that, for the men right next to you because, out there, that is all that you have.

","This film shows us the first great battle that Americans suffered during the Vietnam War. Its difficult for me to assess how fair the film is in the picture of the battle, which I don't know very well, but I can say that I have not seen many problems with historical rigor. The film emphasizes the deficient American preparation for that type of war and the way that specific location was underestimated. It's a war movie and it has, of course, a lot of action but, despite some appeals to patriotism, it's not fanatical about it as some other films are (""Black Hawk Down"", for example). This moderation was something I appreciated, as well as the focus on the human drama of the soldiers and how they had to solve that difficult situation. The result is a war film that does not stray from the feelings, embracing its humanity even though it may displease those who went to the theater expecting to see another ""Rambo"". Mel Gibson is the main actor and fills his character with courage, heroism, faith and dignity. He is a good actor and is on a family record, not being the first war film in which he participates. The rest of the cast doesn't stand out much but fulfills our expectations and does what it has to do. The film uses sound and special effects very well, realistically portraying the soldiers' action on the ground. The scenarios contribute to this realism and have been very well reproduced."

","Released in 2002, ""We Were Soldiers"" stars Mel Gibson as Col. Hal Moore who leads the first major battle between Americans and the North Vietnamese Army in The Battle of Ia Drang Valley over four days in mid-November, 1965. Sam Elliott costars as the seasoned NCO and Barry Pepper as a bold photographer while Madeleine Stowe appears as the Colonel's wife. Greg Kinnear is also on hand as a helicopter pilot while Keri Russell plays a soldier's wife.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once¬Ö and Young"" by Col. Moore and the aforementioned photographer, Joe Galloway. As such, ""We Were Soldiers"" is a straight-forward realistic depiction of the battle and the first film depiction where Moore claimed ""Hollywood finally got it right."" This reminds me of something someone I know who fought in Nam said: All the other films about the war from the late 70s to late 80s didn't strike him as the way it really was, but after seeing ""We Were Soldiers"" he said, ""That's the way it was."" <br/><br/>Be that as it may, it doesn't make it as good as 1986' ""Platoon"" or 1979's ""Apocalypse Now."" The former is so great because the platoon in the story is a microcosm of many platoons and their experiences throughout the war, which might come across as ""too much"" because the filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame. Incredibly, ""Platoon"" fleshes-out no less than a dozen memorable characters with its grunt's-eye view of the conflict while telling a compelling story. By contrast, ""We Were Soldiers"" only presents about four memorable characters during the battle and, while it's a solid war flick, it simply isn't as compelling.<br/><br/>As for ""Apocalypse Now,"" it's useless to compare the two because (1.) the original version of ""Apocalypse Now"" (as opposed to the horribly flawed ""Redux"") is a downright cinematic masterpiece; (2.) it's way more than just a war movie; and (3.) its theme is deeper than the conventional and patriotic portrayal of the realistic ""We Were Soldiers."" If you're not familiar with the theme of ""Apocalypse Now,"" it's basically this: Capt. Willard (Sheen) comes face-to-face with two Colonels during his mission up the river to assassinate the rogue Col. Kurtz. Both of the colonel's names start with 'K,' which is no accident. Col. Kilgore (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war. Col. Kurtz (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" instead opts for a simple portrayal of the first major battle of the infamous war and the bravery & horror thereof. The story essentially proposes the question: What would happen if you drop 400 American soldiers into a valley crawling with 4000 soldiers of the NVA? The fighting is presented realistically, brutally and relatively coherently given the chaos of the intense conflict. Col. Moore truly loves his men and Gibson carries the movie with the peripheral help of Elliot and Barry Pepper. On top of this, the movie gives quite a bit of time to North Vietnamese side of the story, which enhances the story.<br/><br/>Some people have rolled their eyes at the Morro Bay locations of central coastal, California, but if you look at Galloway's real-life pics of the battle they chose a great stand-in for the grassy valley. I guess people don't realize that Vietnam isn't all conventionally tropical jungle.<br/><br/>The film runs a little overlong at 2 hours and 18 minutes and was shot in Morro Bay, Pasadena and Fort Hunter Liggett, California; as well as Fort Benning and Columbus, Georgia.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (6.5/10 Stars)"

","We Were Soldiers often goes unmentioned next to the ""Vietnam giants"" such as Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. And yet, it's a terrifically balanced and powerful film. Here's why...<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is arguably the movie's heart and soul, portraying a stern yet very human US military officer who is charged with leading a new unit into the hell of Vietnam. The film's opening scenes present Gibson as just as much a family man as a soldier, which is credit to the screenplay in enabling us to relate to his character in an intimate way. The film's progress is rather leisurely at first, which adds to a sense of built up tension and suspense towards their fateful encounter with the Vietnamese. That said, once battle begins, the action is unrelenting and brutal. Some great filming grants the audience a real sense of being in the grass alongside the men, and the film's pyrotechnic effects are very commendable indeed. A nice touch is the perspective in Wallace's directing; he pays consistent attention to the women back home as well as the Vietnamese in sharing their experience of the conflict - this is a nice touch that broadens the film's scope and isn't present in other war films depicting Vietnam. The film's overriding sense seems to be that soldiers, despite being trained and expected to kill, are ultimately only human. This gives We Were Soldiers a lovely extra dimension to those that like to watch their cinema closely and appeals to more than just avid thrill seekers. <br/><br/>We were Soldiers is a very thoughtful and honest war film. It poignantly suggests the hell and chaos of war, but also manages to balance this with moments of stark beauty and tear rendering emotion. For reasons unknown, it's a very underrated war film, and one I urge you to take the time out to see."

Editorial comments in the same magazine indicated that many veterans appreciated this movie far more than ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon"".<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is a straight soldier's story without the weird baggage that accompanies so many Vietnam War movies. No Russian roulette, no terminations with extreme prejudice, no surfing colonels. It was also a battle fought without civilians caught in the crossfire, which so defined the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is about the formation of a battalion of the US Air Mobile Division and its baptism of fire in South Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley in 1965. The story is told from the point of view of the unit's commander, Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson. Moore's wife, played by Madeleine Stowe, also has a pivotal role in the story, which shows the impact of the battle on the soldier's families as they await news at home.<br/><br/>Moore's battalion traces its heritage to Custer's ill-fated 7th Cavalry, and the Little Big Horn is always at the back of the modern commander's mind.<br/><br/>Moore's men land by helicopter, and although greatly outnumbered, engage the enemy in a fierce battle. The real life Colonel Hal Moore felt the battle was a draw; US forces withdrew, but although their casualties were heavy, the North Vietnamese casualties were many times higher.<br/><br/>Gibson's movie concentrates just on the actions of Moore's men. In his book, Moore relates how two other units were eventually drawn into the fighting. When they withdrew the following day, they were ambushed ‚Äì the real events were not quite as tidy as in the movie.<br/><br/>Gibson is fine as Colonel Hal Moore, no doubt a challenge with the real man, according to the film's publicity, a visitor to the set. Mel gives the role depth and his pain seems real when he has to order his men into situations that could cost them their lives.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott's grizzled Sergeant Major Plumley, based on the real-life soldier, adds a role worthy to be mentioned with the great screen noncoms. Greg Kinnear as Major Bruce Crandall, who leads the helicopter pilots, also turns in a compelling performance.<br/><br/>The film doesn't glorify war, but the sequences where the movie falls down tend to be where the filmmakers included some very standard ""Hollywood"" interpretations of war.<br/><br/>Although the Vietnamese are portrayed with respect in some scenes, in others they are mowed down mercilessly. Towards the end, many North Vietnamese conveniently move mid-camera to die in a swirl of slow motion arterial spray accompanied by Nick Glennie-Smith's dirge-like score ‚Äì a hackneyed technique even by the late 1960's.<br/><br/>These scenes create a jarring note, along with those in the beginning where the French are wiped out in a perfunctory manner. Although defeated on RC4, the paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion in particular fought with desperate bravery and deserved a little more cinematic respect. The sequence looks fake, and leaves an unfair perception.<br/><br/>With that said, the positives outweigh the negatives in ""We Were Soldiers"".<br/><br/>The scenes where the families of the soldiers are informed about the deaths of loved ones are genuinely affecting, and must still touch raw emotions in the people involved.<br/><br/>Volatile politics and events such as Mai Lai have overshadowed the fact that many Vietnam-era soldiers fought actions at the small unit level that were as bloody as some of the worst battles of WW2. Gibson's movie helps balance the ledger. It shows the disproportionate price some people pay ‚Äì physically and spiritually ‚Äì in the service of their country. Although Vietnam is an old war now, the essential message of ""We Were Soldiers"" is still timely, because some people are still paying that price."

","I must agree with the reviewer from Texas. Vietnam was a misunderstood and very unpopular war. I'm also retired Air Force and I volunteered for Vietnam. I arrived in Vietnam 7 December 1965. One month after the events of the Is Drang Valley. Why this war was unpopular can be debated. Needles to say it was the first war fought from the Whit House and not the commanders in the field. <br/><br/>It's only now with the declaration of Vietnam Recognition Day established this year we are beginning to earn the respect we should've received when we returned home from Vietnam. It was not our fault it was an unpopular war. Vietnam was the first war where reporters and the TV camera was right there to show the horror and the liberal side of the war, not actually what was happening. The truth of the matter war is hell--it's not pretty. It's ugly and people die. This movie We Were Soldiers portrays a very accurate look at warfare in all it's horror and ugliness."

Nothing made in the future will ever stand up to 'The Deer Hunter', 'Apocalypse Now' and the best of the bunch...Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' from 1986.  'We Were Soldiers' has just a bit too much combat and not enought strength of character.  I did enjoy seeing the stakes as high as they were in the fact that Mel Gibson has a large family in the movie and this kept hope alive that he wouldn't get killed.  I'm not saying whether he does or not.  Randall Wallace, who wrote 'Braveheart' which was directed by Gibson, writes and directs 'We Were Soldiers' with good steadiness, believable action sequences and a state of the art sound track.  But I just felt the film was too long, too drawn out and rather than show flashes of combat which last a few minutes, Wallace chooses to assault the senses head on and thus fails to make this a film that requires enjoyable multiple viewings."

I wasn't disappointed. The battle scenes were well portrayed and intense. However the way the battle ended in the film is not historical. None the less the action is equal to the level of blood & guts elevated by movies like Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>A quick note to my fellow posters overseas: If these American war films are so much flag waving patriotism to you guys - why keep watching them?

","I approached this movie with some trepidation. Was this going to be another over glorified war movie or was it going to convey the message that, as General Sherman said 140 years ago, ""War is Hell"". I am happy to say it was the later. As a Viet Nam era veteran (I was in the Army in 1968-1970, a tank platoon leader, but never served in Viet Nam) I have the utmost respect for those who did serve and ultimately made the supreme sacrifice. This movie, unpleasantly graphic at times and not for the faint of heart, shows the heroism and extraordinary leadership of Col. Moore. He was a devout family man and a compassionate warrior. He cared for his men and led by example. In my time in the Army I saw many ""book"" officers but can remember only a few who I considered real leaders. If the real Col. Moore was as portrayed in the movie my hat is off to him. Too many officers were ""ring knockers"" (West Point graduates) who led by the rank insignia on their collar. Col. Moore saw his duty and performed it, whether he felt the orders were idiotic (they were) or that he was leading his men into a trap (they were).<br/><br/>Another thing about this movie which impressed me was the way the enemy was humanized and not demonized, as is usual. The North Vietnamese were fighting for their country and had the same fears and hopes as their American counterparts. This movie did an uncommon job of showing that.<br/><br/>In closing I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the savagery and futility of war and the uncommon men who rise above it to be true leaders and heros, even when their leadership is not."

","Okay - I'm midway through this movie - it's on pause on my DVD player right now, and I had to chime in.<br/><br/>This movie is saccharine!  The story sets up two fronts - one with Mel Gibson fighting in Vietnam and another with his wife, Madeline Stowe, commanding the wives at a domestic base.  The action is fantastic, and the visuals are amazing - but there are just so many super-patriotic moments thrown in that needlessly remind the viewer how great America is.  You've seen this movie before, trust me.<br/><br/>What really made me pause the thing is the token black family!  Why did they even bother?  The movie plays it like a trite conflict, and heralds that all races and creeds are good (as long as they fight for the USA).  In fact, there is a white woman who thinks that a laundry service sign that reads, ""WHITES ONLY"" means that you can't wash your greens and blues and reds there.  The black wife is so ridiculously stereotyped!  All the other pretty white wives respect her ""take-charge"" attitude - not to mention that when they deliver the news that her husband was killed, she more or less snaps her fingers and repeats, ""Oh no you didn't, oh no you didn't!"" over and over again.  That put me over the top.<br/><br/>I have never read the book, ""We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young,"" so maybe racism is indeed a factor of the story.  But in this movie, it develops out of nowhere.  I understand that of course, it was an issue at the time, and perhaps doesn't need an development.  But still - the payoff looks meek regardless.  I guess I'll find out.  Back to the movie.<br/><br/>On a final note - this thing looks like it was re-edited and re-thought significantly after all the September 11th stuff.  I wonder if it would have been a little more cynical if the attacks never occured."

Exhausting, as well, in that the continual (almost 1.5 hour) battle scene was intense, face-to-face and like the intro to Private Ryan times 10 billion. Mel Gibson was decent, which surprised me, and the story does even attempt to show the other (Vietcong) side of the battle, which is surprising considering the usual ultra-patriotic side of such films. Granted, it wasn't exactly sympathetic to the Vietcong side, but at least the attempt was made.<br/><br/>The basic point you should understand about We Were Soldiers is that it is incredibly graphic, ultra violent and rather rewarding in the end.

","this movie was incredibly graphic. I really thought it was well made. It grabbed your attention with it's intense surreal battle scenes. However, this film is not without it's flaws. Namely, the biggest flaw is when they interrupt the grim intense and surreal battle scenes to cut to the reactions of the wives getting their telegrams about their dead. Who cares? As if they could get these telegrams out so fast that it could happen at the same time. Basically every single scene with the wives of the soldiers in it, every single scene, was worthless and could have been cut from the movie as it only constituted about ten mintues of film. It was very distracting.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the characters, basically all of them, were very one dimensional. I didn't find this so distracting as the wife thing, but it bears mentioning. Hal Moore (Gibson)is the model person, it is almost ridiculous, but fortunately for the movie his shallowness is only contained in the first few minutes of the film. Once the action moves to Ia Dang, Gibson brings remarkable depth to an unremarkable character.<br/><br/>Aside from the lack of depth, the obligatory wife scenes, and anything that has to do with chris klein, this movie was great.

","WE WERE SOLDIERS is not the kind of movie I feel comfortable saying ""I enjoyed"" or ""I liked.""  But I'm not sure that's the reaction one is supposed to have upon seeing it.  GLORY and BRAVEHEART took us to the middle of the battlefield like never before.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN showed us the frenzied chaos of modern warfare with new and brutal realism. WE WERE SOLDIERS may end up being the film that some claim goes too far in portraying the unspeakable horror of war.  I attended a screening that consisted largely of Vietnam veterans and their wives.  Several attendees excused themselves suddenly during the battlefield scenes which make up more than half of the movie.  Many watched through covered faces and teary eyes. But when the credits began to roll, not a soul moved.  Not one.  It was only when the lights came up that the audience responded with brief applause before getting up to leave.  And I am sure I am not the only one who left the theatre with a sickening knot in my stomach.<br/><br/>The story of WE WERE SOLDIERS is thin at best.  After an introduction to the major characters, all are thrown into the hell of battle, either the physical hell of Vietnam or the mental anguish of waiting on the homefront for news one hopes never comes.  For the rest of the movie, it becomes about one thing: which characters will stay alive?  Which, I realize, is part of the point in a movie like this, because that's what it became about for the soldiers: staying alive.  Not how they got there, not whether or not they should have been there, not how they felt about being there-- just staying alive.  And the battlefield scenes are the most horrific I have ever seen, previously cited examples included. They are gory, they are long, they are brutally relentless.  Again, I understand that is perhaps part of the point, part of the lesson about war.  But that is a hard thing to ask of a theatre full of people who have paid 8 dollars apiece to see a movie that doesn't look especially violent based on the trailer.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't say I ""enjoyed"" WE WERE SOLDIERS.  I can't say I ""liked"" it.  What I can say is that, for the first time, I may have some tiny, infinitesimal, ultimately meaningless fraction of a notion of what my father-in-law went through in Vietnam, and why he's never spoken a word about it to anyone.  And that, perhaps, is a much more important thing to be able to say."
"svwebzine","Null","0","0","21 February 2002"," Absolutely incredible, BEST WAR MOVIE EVER
","We Were Soldiers (10 out of 10 stars) By C.J. Cauley<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is a truly remarkable, epic motion picture about love and war.  Mel Gibson was the perfect pick for the lead role of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore.  He is absolutely arresting.  This is the best movie of Gibson's distinguished career.  This time next year, I have no doubt that ""We Were Soldiers"" will have a steady stream of awards under its belt and more than a handful of Academy Award nominations to boast about.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by director Randall Wallace, is based on the best selling book ""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young"" by Hal Moore and Joe Galloway.  Together they recorded the story of 400 brave Americans who faced down an army of 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers in the Ia Drang Valley. Not only does it tell the story of the soldiers themselves, but also of the families they left behind, particularly the military wives.  It even touches on the Vietnamese soldiers' stories.<br/><br/>On November 14, 1965, Lt. Col. Moore led the air calvary into the Ia Drang Valley in the central highlands of Vietnam.  It would later become known as the valley of death.  These young husbands, fathers and sons bond as brothers on the battle field while their wives hold down the fort back home. There is savage realism in the battle scenes, it is not for the faint of heart or stomach.  It is quite possibly the most realistic war movie ever made.<br/><br/>Moore is a valiant leader who repeatedly refuses to leave his men in the heat of battle.  He vows to be the first one on the battle field and the last one to leave it and to never leave a man behind, alive or dead.  His nobility is second only to his courage.  These young men were military minions just doing their job when America was thrust into the Vietnam war. They had to go.  There were no choices.  They were heroes but they were treated as anything but when they returned to the country who had sent them to fight.  This does not go unnoticed in ""We Were Soldiers.""<br/><br/>The story is so completely well rounded, in fact, that it covers everything from the racial tensions in the southern U.S. at the time to the perils of being a soldier and a father to the struggles the military wives faced back home.  Madeleine Stowe leads the ladies' charge as Julie Moore.  Keri Russell plays Barbara Geoghegan, wife of Second Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, played by Chris Klein.  While Jack follows Moore's lead thousands of miles away in Vietnam, Barbara does the same with Mrs. Moore back home, organizing the women and trying to keep their spirits up.<br/><br/>There is death and loss, honor and bravery and even a few candid moments of comic relief.  A lot of the funnier lines come from the most stoic of the group, Moore's right hand man, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, played by Sam Elliott.  Like Moore, Plumley is a Korean War vet with years of service under his belt.  He is both a leader and a comrade to his young underlings. Greg Kinnear also gets a few laughs as Major Bruce Crandall, one of the helicopter pilots dropping off the soldiers at Landing Zone X-ray in the Ia Drang Valley.  Both should also be commended for their dramatic performances.<br/><br/>Barry Pepper is civilian war corespondent Joe Galloway.  Shortly after the fighting begins, he joins the soldiers on the battle field to document their struggle.  He soon finds himself just as much a soldier as a journalist. Galloway would later receive the only combat award of valor given to any civilian in the Vietnam War.  He would also later marry the daughter of one of Moore's fallen men.  Moore and Galloway form a bond that has obviously lasted a lifetime.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson's emotional resonance is astounding as is the rest of the cast's. The groups of soldiers and wives seemed to have a genuine kinship.  The result is an incredibly beautiful and at the same time terribly horrific and gripping tale of uncommon valor.  ""We Were Soldiers"" is a startling film with a terrific cast of characters and excellent direction by Randall Wallace who also directed ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and wrote the screenplay for ""Braveheart.""  The Wallace/Gibson duo is a team that cannot be beat.<br/><br/>Beyond direction and performance is phenomenal cinematography by Dean Semler.  An Academy Award winner for Best Cinematography for ""Dances With Wolves,"" Semler brings valued experience to the project.  Semler photographed ""We Were Soldiers"" in a ""cinema verite"" style which brings the battle scenes right to you.  It's almost like a documentary, bringing all of the action right to the forefront.  The detail is incredible, right down to the increasing pupil size of a dying man.<br/><br/>The majesty of ""We Were Soldiers"" is hard to put into words.  When you become completely oblivious to the method in which you are viewing a story, the cinematography and direction are at the highest most level of perfection.  When a stellar cast is brought together to deliver the story with both undeniable elegance and sobering sincerity, the actors become real.  When you have all of these elements, you have a genuine masterpiece called ""We Were Soldiers.""  Mel Gibson is to Vietnam what Tom Hanks is to World War II.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! (And bring a hankie!)"

","The early buzz on ""We Were Soldiers"" centered around its historically accurate portrayal of the VietNam War. Unfortunately, historical accuracy does not necessarily translate into an entertaining film (imagine a two-and-a-half hour epic on Thomas Edison's work on the electric light bulb). One may argue that films like ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Deer Hunter"", and ""Full Metal Jacket"" were distortions of the VietNam reality, however, they were damn good entertainment and that's why we pay $9.50 for two hours of seat rental. Who would you rather see landing a Huey in a hot LZ -- Robert Duvall and his troops blaring amplified Wagner or Greg Kinnear, on the verge of tears?<br/><br/>Mel Gibson and Sam Elliot were superb in their roles. Madeline Stowe, in a bad wig, was miscast as Moore's (Mel Gibson) wife. In fact, all of the wives portrayed in the film looked a little too much like Hollywood actresses.<br/><br/>Having suffered through ""Black Hawk Down"" recently (a mind-numbingly long battle scene passing itself off as a full-length feature movie), I was hoping that WWS would be as good as the advance hype.

These families suffered along with the soldiers, on a completely different level, but none the less significant. The frustration and futility of fighting this political war, at the expense of our naive youth, was brought to life with every relentless battle scene. Although the realistic combat scenes were difficult to watch, they were necessary to tell the story with full impact. The movie ended abruptly, and the lights came up, not giving the audience members a moment to wipe tears or reflect private thoughts. Then I realized, the most POIGNANT part of the movie was at THAT very moment, because the screen began to scroll with all the names of the actual casualties of that particular battle in 1965.

I do remember that newscast by Johnson escalating the war -- I also remember that it was never a declared war -- I also remember that this was 1965 and we were to have ten more dreadful years of a political disaster that took the lives of 58,000 brave, young Americans for no reason at all.  this film did cover these political facts at the beginning of the movie -- the leaders were aware of what kind of ""war"" this would be but because they were soldiers, and ordered to do what they did, they did it with courage, honor, and loyalty to their men.  This film is a wonderful lesson in history and young people should see it so they will know what happened during those tumultuous years.  We were never attacked by Vietnam and had no business there except the business that the politicians thought we had there.  Now with our war on Terrorism, we do have business annihilating radical Muslim terrorists because they must assuredly did ATTACK us, as surely as the Japanese did in Pearl Harbor.  But Vietnam was another matter, and this film brings this out.  Congratulations to the producers of this film, and to Mr. Gibson for bringing us another fine film."

","Though not highly stylized, I was stunned to the degree that this film took to make you feel like you where right there with those men in combat.  It's not Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, or Platoon.  It is however, remarkably good, and where it skimps on drama, flare and commentary, it makes up in a direction that is more cut to the point, almost documentary feeling.  Not for the weak of stomach, as this film really got the blood and guts nearly to a new level in several of the combat sequences.  However, it is NOT done in a Starship Troopers ultra gory, blood for the fun of it over the top sort of way.  Yes, there's blood and enough of it to fill an Olympic swimming pool.  But it never seems unrealistic.  A good film to help understand what the Vietnam conflict might have really been like.  I should note that I went to the screening with very low expectations¬Ö Ever since Mels war movies post-Brave Heart I just sort of went, ¬ëneh¬Ö  Heck, I haven't even seen Patriot yet.

Talk about a terrible failure. Not only did this move drag the watcher out of the movie flow, it made the action on the field seem fake, and not quite as important.

","What an excellent movie this turned out to be.  Closer to Braveheart than to The Patriot, but really a movie in it's own right, Wallace and Gibson deliver the goods here.  I had read the critics reviews of this movie, and they rated from fair to good, but none glowering like for Black Hawk Down. While a picture of a totally different nature than BHD, it still deservers it's due.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is not just war, but the impact on the lives of Americans that being a soldier brings - a valid theme if I've ever heard one.  And, after reading the reviews, I think it's safe to say that due to the Armageddon's, Legends of the Fall's, Stepmom's and even Wallace's The Patriot, that we are a bit cynical of false bravado and heart string pulling.  But I think in this case the critics were a bit oversensitive to it.  Yes, on a few occasions Wallace is heavy handed in depicting the emotions at hand, bordering on melodramatic, but overall the transgressions are sparse and negligible. Furthermore, Gibson nails the fatherly Lt. Colonel leading the first ever charge of the Air Cav and Sam Elliot turns in a role he was perhaps born to play.  Chris Klein certainly doesn't do his career any damage in a supporting role, and the cinematography and choreography in this movie are top notch - two make or break areas for the modern war movie.<br/><br/>So, that being said and me being ex-Cav myself, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I will confess to getting teary eyed at a few points, and a guy in his mid-40s that I assumed to be a Vietnam Vet full out crying at the movies end is as good of a testament to authenticity as anything I can give you. I was genuinely moved by the emotions of the movie, and captivated by the combat scenes. If the critics were looking for more than that, let 'em keep looking. 3 1/2 stars."

And they land on an ant hill. It's 600 Americans against 4000 NVA soldiers (reminding me of Pork Chop Hill, 1959).  I tolerated the first act as overblown melodrama, but found myself sucked in bad by the second act. Sure there was plenty of graphic fire fights  for us action fans, but the scene that broke me up was when the yellow taxi cabs delivered telegrams to the wives of the soldiers killed in action while the battle was still going on. I'll admit, I lost it. Would this film have carried itself without Mel Gibson, I don't think so, but add great directing, cinematography, and one of the most hauntingly timed musical scores (that included chanting Buddhist monks)  to heighten scenes and you have a moving war film that tries to remind us that plenty of good people (American and Vietnamese) died in Vietnam.

"biff39093","Null","0","0","3 March 2002"," A very good piece of film history
","We Were Soldiers covers the events of LZ X-Ray in the Vietnam `conflict.' The entire issue of Vietnam is a totally different topic to be fully discussed at a later time and date, in a different setting and context. Since it is the basis for the plot of the movie, I will briefly mention that people died for absolutely no reason.  The United States was afraid of communism, and felt that the only way to deal with it was to wipe out anyone who believed in it, or followed it.  We sent American soldiers over to Vietnam to destroy this fear that we had.  Many innocent lives of young men were lost, with nothing positive to come out of it. 	<br/><br/>Mel Gibson plays Hal Moore, and is essentially the backbone of this movie. Randall Wallace adapts this screenplay from the book entitled `We Were Soldiers Once . . .And Young,' written by the real life Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore.  Wallace directs Soldiers as his sophomore effort.  The Man In The Iron Mask being his previous effort. We are treated to several great supporting performances from various well-known actors.  Barry Pepper (as Joe Galloway), Keri Russell (as Barbara Geoghegan), Greg Kinnear (as Maj. Bruce 'Snakes**t' Crandall), Chris Klien (as Lt. Jack Geoghegan), and Madeline Stowe (as Julie Moore) all lend to a wonderful supporting cast that helps boost the superior performance of Mel Gibson. 	<br/><br/>I look at We Were Soldiers as the Saving Private Ryan of Vietnam.  Ryan covered some of the events of World War II with a rather intriguing story, and excellent action sequences that have yet to be beaten by anything to date.  Soldiers is the closest thing to date.  I also view The Thin Red Line as the ""artsy-fartsy"" film covering the Second World War.  Most of the movie contains inner monologues, which is quite boring, and the action sequences are fair at best.  In the Vietnam area, Platoon and Apocalypse Now are the artsy films in my mind.  Not so much Platoon but more Apocalypse Now.  The action sequences in both are stunning, but do not occur that often.  The movies rely on the characters rather than special effects to carry the movie. 	<br/><br/>Soldiers devotes the first hour to setting up the characters that will be going into battle.  Their training along with some of their struggles with each other are shown to give us an inside look into how they think and behave.  I appreciate this attempt since a certain bond is formed with the audience and some of the characters.  I also enjoyed the fact that the movie focused on the family man going into battle rather than the single male.  In Platoon Charlie Sheen is a single man going into battle.  It focuses on his struggles to make due with what he has, or lacks for that matter.  Soldiers gives us insight into the reverse side of the spectrum, and tells us how hard it was for a father to go into battle leaving their families behind. It was very difficult for Hal Moore, and Jack Geoghegan to leave their families and venture into the unknown land of Vietnam with the terrible expectation that they probably would not make it back alive.  These struggles are addressed and explained but, as is shown, there really is no way to appropriately deal with this hardship. 	<br/><br/>The battle scenes cover the three-day conflict of LZ X-Ray.  These scenes are something that can finally be compared to those of Ryan.  Everything is well choreographed, and slow motion is not over used, like in every rap video today, and all John Woo movies.  Things seem to happen as realistic as possible, or at least as I can observe.  It is nice to see something that attempts to lean more toward the realistic side, rather than the fantasy side. 	<br/><br/>With We Were Soldiers an attempt was made to make something as positive as possible on such a negative subject.  Vietnam is a very touchy topic with many people, and they feel that we never should have been there in the first place.  Soldiers succeeds in giving us a very entertaining story, with superb, top-notch battle sequences, and actors and actresses that actually believe in the project they are doing.  The ability to combine all of this into one neat package is a feat not accomplished too often.  This is a movie that will satisfy all, and will be one of the best movies of 2002.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"jake-179","5","0","0","3 March 2002"," Not as good as I expected
","ICON productions has had a couple of great movies.  Namely, BRAVEHEART and PAYBACK were both fantastic movies that I watch over and over again.  But ""WE WERE SOLDIERS"" does not live up to the previous titles. <br/><br/>
The movie was talked up to be extremely graphic with explicit images of war violence.  And, in fact, it was pretty graphic.  But after seeing SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN, this movie was mild by comparison.  Also, I did not find myself caring about any of the characters as much as I did the characters in RYAN and BLACK HAWK.  <br/><br/>The movie does not seem to flow very well.  The first act of the movie is very long and teeters on the edge of boredom.  It mostly follows the 400 soldiers that would be the first to encounter the North Vietnamese army as they prepare and train.  The audience learns about the characters and the beautiful wives and adoring children they will inevitably leave behind.  By the way, the woman that plays Chris Klein's wife is SUPER HOT!  If I had a woman like that, there is no power on earth that would pry me away from her. Not the Viet Nam War or anything else.  Anyway, that first act dragged on a little too long.  <br/><br/>Also, the characters are presented as just a little too saint-like.  Half way through I was thinking, ""Is Mel Gibson a soldier or a preacher?""  The movie practically beats you over the head with a cross as you watch.  I kept expecting to see Mel Gibson walking on water. <br/><br/>By the way, combat helmets have chin straps for a reason.  Why do the soldiers in this movie only wear their chin straps while they are in formation on a parade field, when not much is really happening?  But then, when all hell breaks loose on the battle field, nobody puts their chin straps on.  I thought that was distracting.   <br/><br/>Now for my biggest problem with this movie.  CAUTION!  SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>OK, fair warning.  The wives wait back at home to hear word of their husbands.  The telegrams informing them of the dead are delivered by the ominous yellow cab.  So, when the yellow cab shows up, the wives all freak out and the audience is nervous to find out who has now died.  Each time that yellow cab shows up, somebody else has died.  And we are worried about Mel Gibson's wife and family, of course.  Then, at the end of the movie, the yellow cab makes one last stop...at Mel Gibson's house where his wife and kids are waiting.  The door bell rings, and the wife looks out the window. There is that awful yellow cab.  She can hardly open the door, and emotionally orders the children to bed.  Then, bravely opens the door...and surprise!  Its Mel Gibson!  He survived!  And felt that it was necessary to RING THE DOORBELL TO HIS OWN HOUSE!  WHERE HIS FAMILY LIVED!  Maybe it was just a little JOKE he was playing on his EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT WIFE!!!??? A cruel little joke.  I am sure his character was thinking, ""Haha, it will be hilarious to trick my wife in to thinking I have been horribly killed in battle!  Then, SURPRISE!""  No, I don't think that was what his character had in mind.  I think the director of the movie took a CHEAP SHOT at the AUDIENCE!  And this was a low point for the movie, to be sure.  No one in my family ever rings the doorbell when they are coming home, they just WALK IN because THAT IS WHERE WE ALL LIVE.  I don't ring the doorbell to my own HOUSE!<br/><br/>I don't want to be disrespectful to this movie or to the cause of the Viet Nam War, or to the men who died there.  My father fought hard in Viet Nam, and saw a lot of action.  As I grew up, he spared no detail in telling me about the various horrors he witnessed.  And because of this, I have a better understanding of what Viet Nam was about and therefore I have a higher standard by which I judge movies dealing with the subject.  In my opinion, I have never seen a movie about Viet Nam that depicted the events accurately.  No, not even PLATOON was accurate.  When directors make movies about the Viet Nam war and they glorify or romanticize the events, then they do an injustice to heroes who fought there.  WE WERE SOLDIERS tries to do justice to the events, but it falls short somewhere.  However, it is not without a certain element of entertainment.  And I really enjoyed Sam Niel's character.  He was great as an old war dog, bitter and strong. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, I have to rate this movie fairly low for the reasons listed above."

He's a good actor and all but after seeing him as a war hero in Bravehart and The Patriot, i sorta go disgusted of him. He's no different than he was in the two prvious films. Which was an honest man that cared for his soldiers and was a good natured guy. The film takes place in Vietnam in some valley of death (i forget). American troops are dropped off into a valley to seek out Viet Cong Forces. This ends up being a disatrous decision where it was a set ambush by the Viet Cong.  It ends up being an hour and half of killing where the US ends up fighting to survive.<br/><br/>
What i liked: I like how a movie attempted to show the Viet Congs point of view and thier feelings but fell short. Good acting and cinematography to along with. Showed how women were affected back home in the US.<br/><br/>What i did not like: Didn't like how the Amercian lives seemed to be valued much more in the film. Example is that it would show an american soildier die so vailiantly with american patriotic style whereas it would just show a vietnamese soldier get shot, grap his chest, then fall down like he was a domino piece. Many of the sequences deemed too unbelieveable  for example *********SPOILER********* ......During the fighting, Mel Gibson stood up the whole time with a straight back abd giving orders. Guys were getting killed hiding in the ground and lying down. But Mel Gibson never got a scratch.***********END OF SPOILER******* The soldiers never really question why they were there and what they thought about the conflict. You gotta watch a movie the movie too see what i'm saying.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If your a fan of the genre of War. Go see it. But if you arn't a particular fan, go see a vietnam movie such as Apocalypse Now, or Platoon. Those are the movies that shine based on the Vietnam War. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a movie that seems to dazzle you with action more than show you a simulation of what war really was in that era.<br/><br/>-=FINALY VERDICT=-  6/10"

This is a meaty film with plenty to admire, provoke and digest.  Sure there are about half a dozen lines that might make potential script writers squirm but Randall Wallace has succeeded brilliantly in the goal he set for himself (he spoke after the screening). And that was the goal of telling the soldiers stories... devoid of any extraneous political complications. These men fought for each other. Wallace also doesn't make the mistake of dehumanizing the enemy. The Vietnamese are given a great deal of sympathetic screen time. As Wallace said, the only enemy is war itself and he made a conscious effort to have no ""evil"" characters.

","I went to the bookstore to look through the book this movie was based on. In the prologue, the author criticized Hollywood for screwing up all movies about Vietnam and for not telling how war really is.  Hollywood did not do justice once again ironically this time to this very book.<br/><br/>
After watching the movie, all I could say to myself is, ""Come on, that didn't happen...""  This is sad because there are many Americans and viewers around the world who also demand not to be insulted by how Hollywood often likes to.  Even sadder is that there are others who are prone to believe that the film really depicts reality... that American soldiers do shoot like Rambo... that the enemy just packs up and leaves seeing defeat... that the Americans clearly won this battle.<br/><br/>It always felt all throughout the film wanted to stay truer to the book and thus to the events that transpired.  But after all it is a product of Hollywood which we all know is motivated by profit.  That means, the script has to be padded with action, explosions, and moments of patriotism.  The fudged-up story confuses fact and fiction and denies all of us the valuable lessons that the brief, brutal, tragic events in the small patch of land in Vietnam could have offered.  The decisions to compromise integrity made the difference between a truly great film and a mediocre Vietnam flick.<br/><br/>However, I felt ""We Were Soldiers"" shined in the opening sequence.  I always thought that the beachhead opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" could never be topped.  True, it was filled with action, scale, and immediacy. In ""We Were Soldiers"" though, the opening sequence in less than two minutes strikes right in your face the savageness and absurdity of war.  Highly effective, absolutely brilliant."

","This movie opens with the words:  ""This is the true story...""  Were it not for these words, I would be ready to dismiss the sentimentality, brutality, and ultimately the victory of Lt Gen Hal Moore as a Hollywood contrivance. The fact is that Moore walks this earth, these events did happen, and men died horribly on a far-off battlefield at the behest of their misguided countrymen.<br/><br/>The movie is based on journalist Joe Galloway's and Moore's account of their involvement in a 1965 battle in North Vietnam.  It was refreshing and enlightening to see how a battle actually plays out, with attention to terrain, timing, numbers, artillery and air support, communication, transport, and carnage.  The usual war film structure--character and plot development, firefight, more development, firefight, epiphany, firefight, resolution--is abandoned in favour of initial development, then a continuous firefight serving as the backdrop for several well-rounded characters: Moore (Mel Gibson), Galloway (Barry Pepper), Lt Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein), and Maj Bruce 'Snakeshit' Crandall (Greg Kinnear).<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers is also tribute to the heroism, intellect, and compassion of Moore.  And if at times the movie's Moore is saccharin-sweet, as when he prays with his children, comforts a new father in his ranks, or pays his respects to the widow of an enemy soldier, I can forgive the movie because I suspect much of this rings true with the living, breathing, death-dealing Moore of real life.

Especially one that is so wounded he can't walk, so his buddy throws him across his shoulders to carry him?  This happened at least twice in the film.  I guess this is a POSSIBLE SPOILER (especially if this is your first 'Nam flick), but too many times to count, new characters are introduced during the battle only to die moments later.  They are given enough dialogue to try and make us see that they are nice, patriotic guys with someone back home waiting for them.  Then they are gone.   Of course, one could argue that that's a reflection of how it probably was over there, guys speak for the first time, then the next thing they knew the guy they just spoke with was shot down, they were under such heavy fire. The performances were good, but I do question the casting of Mel Gibson. There were moments in the film that I think he went at the part wrong.<br/><br/>This wasn't the best movie about Vietnam, but not the worst, either."

","When I first heard about this movie my first thought was that Mel Gibson had made a big mistake here. Why star in yet another Vietnam war movie when so many had been done before? Not only that but, add to a genre already littered with great, great movies.<br/><br/>Many people will totally disagree with me on this point but I feel that enough movies have been made about this war. I don't disagree with the overriding themes and lessons contained within movies which continue to be made about it - I just feel that most of the good films made already cover the various aspects of that war and that by continuing to make more movies about it in some way dilutes the effect they can potentially have.<br/><br/>That aside I did enjoy this movie. It was visually impressive, certainly bringing the horror of the war and violence directly to the audience, and the action scenes (of which thankfully there were plenty) were all executed expertly.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson's performance was fine, as was Sam Elliot's - even though his character is downgraded to little more than a ""tough as nails sergeant"" stereotype - and the look of the movie seemed to work well overall.<br/><br/>It was the glossy parts of the movie (more akin to early Bruckheimer efforts) I found most dissatisfying.  Especially the Barry Pepper ""photography"" scene which I thought didn't fit in at all with the rest of the movie and, whilst well intended, ended up coming across tacky.<br/><br/>The difficulty Randall Wallace faces here is that it is an action movie first and foremost and, as I've already said, when he concentrates on that the result is above average however when he tries to delve into moments of moral and human examination They just come off looking trite.  Especially when the onscreen ratio is overwhelming action 99% - moral message 1%<br/><br/>Overall, whilst not as good as Black Hawk Down, well worth watching, but not particularly meaningful. 7/10."
"paul_supercala","Null","0","0","27 February 2002"," Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies, this one is not quite what it could have been as a film, but the story and theme make up for it.
","Another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies this year, this one is based on Lt. Gen. Hal Moore's book of the same name. Unfortunately, it's been re-worked and ""Hollywood-ized"" by screenwriter/director Randall Wallace (""The Man in the Iron Mask""), who also penned the dreadful ""Pearl Harbor"" script. It tries a little too hard to pull at your heartstrings to get sympathy for the characters, which isn't necessary considering the tragic elements of the story itself. The character development is strong, which purposely makes it even harder on the viewer when the soldiers are killed.<br/><br/> The actual story itself is very good, though. It deals with Moore's leadership in the first major battle in Vietnam where he realizes that his men are outnumbered and inexperienced. His ""leave no man behind - alive or dead"" attitude inspired the soldiers and gave them reason to carry on. Like it is said in the end of the movie, the men fought for themselves and each other, with almost no support from their fellow countrymen. However, this movie tends to avoid that as a subject, which is admirable. The point wasn't why they were there or if they thought it was right or wrong. It was about courage and nobility, which is rare in a Vietnam movie.<br/><br/> Interestingly enough, the theme of courage is also shown as parallels several characters. It is seen in Moore's wife (Madeline Stowe), who takes it upon herself to keep the women at home strong while their husbands are fighting. It is also found in the Vietnamese leader who continues to encourage his men to fight hard even in the shadow of defeat, and also in the war journalist/photographer (Barry Pepper), who chooses to be in the middle of it all to capture images that will help the people back home understand what the soldiers went through.  While this is nowhere near the caliber of ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"", it does pack a punch and is sure to hit some nerves with some veterans. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliott, Greg Kinnear, and Pepper all give solid performances, but something just isn't quite there that made the aforementioned films as well as other war classics what they are. The dialogue is a little cheesy and ham-fisted and the violent effects don't always seem realistic.<br/><br/> It is hard to ""enjoy"" this film, but it does well to show appreciation for leadership in Vietnam, something that was not shown by the people who should have given it in the first place. If you enjoyed Mel Gibson's work in ""The Patriot"" or ""Braveheart"", you will probably like him in this one as well. While not what it could have been, it's not entirely bad either. Go check it out in the theater if you're going to see it at all, though. As you might expect, it is quite violent, so it might be one to skip if you're squeamish or if it might conjure up some bad memories."
"easter.egg","6","0","0","10 March 2002"," Something old, something new, something borrowed...
","I've got mixed feelings about this one.<br/><br/>I've never been in a war so I appreciate the efforts made here to help a relatively privileged population understand its horrors.<br/><br/>I was torn while watching it, because I realize there's a money-making motive here.  The movie is big and bang-filled to pack people in seats. There's a duel going in this movie between the desire to reveal the fear and pain of war, and the studio push to turn a huge profit.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid this movie will be judged in the coming weeks based on its box-office earnings rather than its substance.  In other words, I think the message may be muted somewhat by a desire to develop the Hollywood themes in the story.<br/><br/>
It's the first Vietnam movie I've seen (or rather, that I can remember)that makes an attempt to show the Vietnamese- North, South, or otherwise- as humans rather than 'yellow demons.'  It's been about 27 years since the 'war' 'ended', which I guess is far enough removed for this kind of movie to come out and be accepted by a larger audience.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's a rampant resurgence of the ""I'm tough on 'em but I love 'em"" officer archetype.  I've not read the book the movie's based on, and I've never met Lt. Col. Moore or Sergeant Major Plumley, so I don't know.... maybe they are/were really like that.  Still, in this movie, its not novel; it's John Wayne.  Say yer prayers and then say yer prayers.<br/><br/>In all, this movie is no classic as far as I can tell (only one day after seeing it) but it's not bad.  It tells the story well, and makes a superficial attempt at seeing both sides of the issue.  What I would really love to see is a film that takes that idea one or two steps further. Might be a couple of years off yet, though.  I don't know if Hollywood's understanding of America is ready for it.<br/><br/>Oh!  Something old... done, Something new... covered, Something borrowed... done that too, Something blue:  Mel Gibson's eyes in the night scenes.  I swear they've been enhanced to make him look more heroic/boyish/pure. Those scenes don't have much else that's vibrantly colourful, except for his eyes. Hmmm."
"mitchs-5","Null","0","0","9 March 2002"," Relatively Acurate and Not Kind
","Like ""Beloved"", this is not a kind movie. I feel this is one of the strongest anti-war movies ever made and the way it depicts the soldiers on both sides of the conflict is probably the most acurate of any war movie.<br/><br/>The movie draws on other classics of the genre, notably ""Run Silent, Run Deep"", in that we are given a soldiers perscpective on what it is to be in combat and the perspective is given from both sides. This particular movie walks a fine line in that it presents the Americans as heroes while it does not glorify them. The Viet Nameese are presented not as sterotype agressors, but as defending their homeland to the best of their ability. For this, the production crew is to be commended.<br/><br/>Points also go to the crew for remining us that while the Army was integrated on paper, segregation was still a part of life in America in the mid sixties. These soldiers showed it really dosen't matter what color you are. a good soldier is recognized by their actions.<br/><br/>The movie is gory, of that there is no doubt. That's what separtates this movie from the typical John Wayne hero epic. War is bloddy and is not to be entered into lightly, a fact that the powers behind the real wor seem to have forgotten.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for the fainthearted, but it is a movie all should see. Perhaps now, the Viet Nam vet can hold their head a little more prooudly knowing that someone told their story truly. They were in a war with bad intelligence at their disposal and little or no support from home. In short, as another general remarked ""War is Hell""."
"aaron54de","Null","0","0","8 March 2002"," yeah? So tell me about it...
","This movie hits (then quickly parries) on a point that most war movies tend to miss: tactics of war.  Almost every film or photo we see depicting Viet Nam battle involves a chopper touching down to transport soldiers.  This became a necessity in Viet Nam due to the enemy's familiarity with the rough terrain and our inability to move effectively across it.  However, the chopper was a new machine to war and thus had never before been used in this manner.  This film shows the true story of one of the first test missions of this new tactic.<br/><br/>Despite some truly awesome scenes depicting helicopter formations, firepower and pilot technique, it doesn't follow through on the technical side of things.  Along with this, the viewer is only teased here and there by a soldier's call for artillery that is set up 5 miles away but can wipe out the enemy 20 yards in front of the request, or a 3 a.m. call for illumination that uncovers enemy soldiers so close you can smell them. There is never the proper amount of concentration or tribute paid to these technical military marvels.  This would not at base be a bad thing, considering.  Tribute is paid instead to the soldiers who truly deserve it. And the concentration is aimed at their personal/home lives.  The problem lies in the movie never showing us either the full military or the full soldier's story.  There are really two movies here, neither of which ever makes itself fully known.  The military movie is disrupted by drama and the drama has a military pace.  Because of this, much of the emotion of this film is misplaced.  This becomes more of a shame since the cinematography, special effects/realism, and even the acting are pretty great.  This is one of the few movies that could have actually been better if it had run longer.<br/><br/>If you like choppers, napalm and gore, you will love the battle scenes. If you like a good cry, you will probably like the dramatic scenes.  But if you like a good, telling war movie you will walk out of this feeling a little dissatisfied.  What makes me a touch more than dissatisfied is the idea that with a little more footage and a slower, more true-to-life dramatic pace, this movie could have been one of the best.  Skip this movie and read the book instead if you really want to discover a good war story."

","If you haven't figured it out yet, Mel Gibson makes formula movies. No deep thoughts and only superficially profound. These awful movies (BraveHeart"" and ""The Patriot"" come to mind) highlight Mel's fighting prowess, his love of children, his lovely wife, his profound sense of duty to his god etc etc etc. This is all the drivel that Conservative, macho military types love. And I'm here to say that it's crap. How a movie about the immoral and misguided Vietnam War can be Apolitical in this day and age is utterly beyond me. Is this just shamless post 9/11 marketing by sleezy Hollywood. Those peddlers of mindless garbage know when the market for mediocre war movies is ripe. And I guess it is right now. So lets get gory effects and match it with idiotic combat sequences worthy of ""The A Team"" and a dirty but determined looking Mel Gibson. The super patriots will get all misty eyed about it. It's a formula that can't fail. It's great how Mel is the heroic freedom fighter in ""Braveheart"", struggling to drive out the English invader from his beloved Scotland. Now compare that to his role as Col Moore in ""We Were Soldiers"". He, or rather we, are now the invaders with all the odds in our favor and guess what, he and/or we are still the heroic role models of leadership and honor. Funny how we always win and look good doing it. wether we are fighting to oust the invader or, as with Vietnam, we ARE the goddamn invader!!! Disgusting ain't it??? I sincerly hope that there are a few veterans of the Ia Drang Valley that recognize this movie for the macho testosterone gore fest that it is. We should never have gone there, we should never have supported French Colonialism (especially since we condemned the Nazi invasion of France in 1940!!!), we should have respected the will of the Vietnamese people since we prize the ""peoples will"" in our own Constitution, we should have been less hysterical and irrational about Communism, we should never have used weapons of mass destruction (napalm, agent orange etc)and above all NEVER trust politicians and corporate types.

I'm sure that when Randall Wallace gets some more practice in he'll be a pretty good second unit director, but the studios have to stop giving him so much money. Randall seemingly lost touch with any idea of what over-acting is about and managed to make everyone except for the principal actors into characatures of real people (""No - uh-uh Not MY husband."") His setups were crystal clear (""I'm having a baby today"" - classic red shirt line) and his fixation on injuries was gratuitous (lets use a full minute of film to show his burned face as the chopper lifts off - a flash on his face and reaction shots all around would have been more effective, as it was I started examining it to see how the makeup was applied). Top that off with CGI that was poorly scaled, poorly matted, poorly detailed and choppy, it made the whole film look amateurish (measured against the CGI in Starship Troopers and Final Fantasy). Thank god for Mel Gibson, Barry Pepper and Sam Elliot, at least they gave the film some aspect of quality.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were really well developed and provided a good insight into just how confused and chaotic modern warfare can be with its drop and deploy mentality.<br/><br/>If I were to compare this movie to any other, I'd say that it was on par with Thin Red Line, though not as pretentious and with a lot more over-acting. I would have to disagree with those that think to compare it with Saving Private Ryan (a well acted movie whose approach took on the quality of Documentary) or Black Hawk Down (a well acted movie with the quality and approach of a documentary). 10 years ago We Were Soldiers would have been branded Commercial Propoganda, now its just a not-very-good movie."

","Just saw this movie in a sneak preview and wasn't expecting much as I sat in the theater.  Randall Wallace is an average screenwriter/filmmaker at best. The ""Pearl Harbor"" screenplay bordered on silly and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was a dull Muskateer popcorn flick.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers,"" based on the excellent book by Col. Hal Moore, etc. about the first major battle of the Vietnam War (Nov. 1965), is another average war movie that rests on cliche, tin-ear dialog and ham-fisted, patriotism.  The movie tries so hard to be ""great"" and ""powerful"" that instead of presenting this amazing story and earning your respect and admiration -- as all truly great films do; the filmmaker demands and tries to force that respect -- he fails.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are graphic, but not realistic.  In nearly every shot of battle the viewer can ""see-the-man-behind-the-curtain"" and spot the hollywood-ism of it all.  Where Spielberg/Hanks suceeded with ""SPR"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" Wallace just gets by.  The blood effects in the film look obviously fake, it's too purple/orange and flows like Karo syrup, pulling the viewer out of the movie.  The pacing is uneven and emotional moments wasted when they are followed by confusing editing/pacing.  Scenes of the ""commanders"" in Saigon fall from the sky it seems and add nothing but on-the-nose exposition.<br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" Is a missed opportunity from start to finish and it's a shame Wallace didn't have the chops to give the story the film treatment it deserves.

The problem is that much of the movie is half-baked, there is no way people get death notices in real time, for example, and some of the scenes were simply made up whole cloth, SPOILER coming, they never did a frontal assault on the enemy using Gatling gun equiped helicopters, why not, well, according to the book, this never happened and at the time, only airplanes carried these weapons, further, we were given the impression that this mythical attack was not planned in conjunction with these mythical machines, which is completely out of character for the colonel.

"rdarlington","Null","0","0","10 March 2002"," Gibson's war trilogy comes to an end - hopefully
","Mel Gibson has now given us a trilogy of ¬ëleadership in war' movies. Putting aside `Gallipoli' (where he was a mere foot soldier), he has led the Scottish against the English in `Braveheart', turned the tide for the Americans against the British in `The Patriot', and now he commands Custer's old unit in Vietnam. This is an account of one of the very few full-scale battles between American troops and North Vietnamese regulars which occurred in November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley in the Central Highlands (recreated in central California). Some 400 US soldiers took on around 2,000 Vietnamese in a fire fight lasting three days and nights.<br/><br/>I've never been over-impressed by Gibson as an actor. He's fine in roles such as the wacky cop in the `Lethal Weapon' series, but I find him a performer of limited range. Nevertheless, here he has beefed up his body, adopted a gruff Southern accent and put on a smart uniform to enable him to give a more than adequate performance as the real life Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore. For Gibson, this is clearly a very personal endeavour. His company Icon co-funded and distributed the film and the director and screenwriter is his old friend Randall Wallace who wrote `Braveheart' (and `Pearl Harbor'). Gibson ¬ñ himself a Catholic with a large family ¬ñ obviously identifies with Moore who is represented as fatherly to both his children and his men. Ironically Gibson's own father moved the family from the USA to Australia partly so that his sons would avoid the draft.<br/><br/>Veteran Sam Elliott is good as the stereotypically tough, loyal and laconic second-in-command (`Sir, Custer was a pussy. You ain't'), but Madeleine Stowe is sadly under-utilised as Moore's stoical wife. By contrast with `The Deerhunter', `Platoon' or `Born On The Fourth Of July', this is very much an officer's view of the Vietnam war with working class characters given very little to say.  <br/><br/>War movies will never be the same since `Saving Private Ryan'.  `We Were Soldiers' ¬ñ like `Black Hawk Down' - presents a brutally visceral version of war in which we are left in no doubt of the terrible sound and awesome destruction of modern ordnance. Indeed there are so many similarities between these two films issued within weeks of one another. Both are based on books and show the essential role of the helicopter in modern warfare to both deliver and sustain ground troops and the all-decisive nature of air power; both involve US troops being massively outnumbered by local forces, inflicting far more deaths than they suffered, and having to fight by night as well as day; and, above all, both portray ill-conceived and ultimately failed American operations in an heroic light.<br/><br/>What distinguishes `We Were Soldiers' from so many other Vietnam movies is the patriotic and religious tone which is made easier by the timing of the incident in question. This was a period before the cynicism and chaos of the war had taken hold, when the Americans still thought they were right to be in this Asian quagmire. For the British viewer, this tone will not sit so easily, although one cannot fail to be stirred by the action and the music. However, I saw the movie with an American friend, who once wrote a book based on the recollections of 19 Vietnam veterans, and he confirmed my clear impression that American audiences -especially post-9/11 - will love it."

","For younger viewers who believe they understand the Vietnam War because they have seen it through the distorting lens of Kubrick, Stone, and others, ""We Were Soldiers"" may come as a shock and a revelation. Despite the high artifice of some of its violent scenes and the melodramtic nature of others (but war is melodrama), it expresses vividly the emotional struggles of American men and women of that time. And it dares to show the Vietnamese as more than helpless victims of psychotic Americans, even inviting us to respect the enemy for his intelligence and dedication. Reviewers who have complained the Moore-Gibson character is just too moral and patriotic to resemble soldiers of that time did not know any of the best soldiers of that time. It may come as a threat to some cynics, but there were such men (not saints, just good men), and those ""protected ones"" had better hope there are such men (and women) yet today. Of course, some in the younger generation will sensitively reflect on this film, as exemplified in a recent report by a Vietnam vet whose son phoned him: ""Thanks for your service, Dad.

(Klein Rules!). Keri Russell is very beautiful and did great in her screen time i really liked her. Barry Pepper is very good as the reporter. Rest of the cast are awesome.

","Mel Gibson's buttock-challenging 138-minute Vietnam War marathon is a B-grade movie with all the usual Yank stereotypes, though it stops short of triumphalism.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Gibson (starring in a role better suited to Ben Affleck) sees fit to include a grudging nod to the heroism and brilliance of the Viet Cong, who successfully defended their homeland against the imperialist American invaders despite being outnumbered 2:1.<br/><br/>The movie ends on a pessimistic note which foreshadows the humiliating defeat America would eventually suffer in 1975. I found this deeply satisfying.<br/><br/>WWS is worth watching at least once, if you're into war movies. Alas, no role for Neville Gorman this time.<br/><br/>I rate 'We Were Soldiers' at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 5/10 on IMDb."
"phd_travel","10","2","5","15 January 2014"," Old fashioned and modern at the same time
","This very good Vietnam war movie about the first major conflict between North Vietnamese and U.S. troops is old fashioned in some ways and modern in some ways. It turns out to have the best aspects of being both old fashioned and modern.<br/><br/>It's old fashioned in it's patriotic heroism of the characters and that the soldiers are too good looking. Chris Klein plays a brave hero, Greg Kinnear a brave helicopter pilot and of course Mel Gibson is the religious and dedicated Colonel in charge. Watching this movie in 2014 again it's quite amusing to see Jon Hamm and Taylor Momsen in a supporting roles. There is no political agenda here about being in a wrong war etc. It's about the heroism of the soldiers not whether they were on the right side or not.<br/><br/>It's modern in the realism of the well choreographed battle scenes and graphic injuries. But it's not as gross as Saving Private Ryan. Also it's sympathetic and unbiased towards both sides Vietnamese and U.S. It actually is quite a clear depiction of the overall battle instead of a confusing mess that some war movies are. There is a good setup of characters prior to the battle and you can clearly see who lives and dies.<br/><br/>There are some faults. The filming location & vegetation didn't look like Vietnam at all. Couldn't they have planted some more suitable trees here and there? Poor Madeline Stowe as the dutiful military wife, probably the most beautiful actress of her generation did something to her lips that made her look strange for a few movies. Thank goodness the cosmetic procedures have settled down since. And what is wrong with that crazy long hair? It's a good solid war movie that's moving without being preachy and exciting without being too violent."

","John Wayne would stand up in his grave and salute Mel Gibson if he saw ""Braveheart"" director Randall Wallace's patriotic tribute to the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry in ""We Were Soldiers,"" with Madeleine Stowe, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, and Sam Elliot. This sentimental but adrenalin-laced Vietnam-era war saga about the first battle between the U.S. Army and uniformed North Vietnamese troopers in November 1965 eschews politics and eulogizes the valorous Americans that fell on the field of honor. Unlike the best-known Vietnam War spectacles, such as Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), Oliver Stone's ""Platoon,"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), all of which loudly condemned the war, ""We Were Soldiers"" confines its criticism to the periphery of its explosive pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this gritty, gung-ho, Mel Gibson, flag-waver is quietly contemptuous about this most ill-handled of American wars. When General Westmoreland wants Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson of ""The Road Warrior"" with a good ole boy southern drawl) to leave the battle and debrief him miles away in Saigon, Moore simply refuses and remains alongside his men. Chiefly, ""We Were Soldiers"" represents the first major Hollywood combat epic to portray the North Vietnamese as flesh and blood mortals with respect and dignity. How willingly American audiences embrace this surprisingly sympathetic treatment of Ho Chi Minh's minions will determine the success of ""We Were Soldiers"" at the box office as well as its overall role in healing our national wounds.<br/><br/>""The Man in the Iron Mask"" scenarist-turned-director Randall Wallace based his old-fashioned but clich√©-cluttered combat screenplay on the 535-page, non-fiction best-seller by Lieutenant General Hal Moore (Ret.) and war correspondent Joseph Galloway entitled ""We Were Soldiers and Young."" Opening in 1954, ""We Were Soldiers"" shows the wily North Vietnamese Army ruthlessly wiping out French troops in the Ia' Drang Valley, a.k.a. 'The Valley of Death.' ""If you kill all they send, NVA commander, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An (Don Duang of ""Three Seasons"") contends, ""they will stop coming."" Eventually, the French stopped coming. The U.S. military followed in their ill-fated footsteps eleven years later. The rugged terrain of Vietnam prompted Pentagon strategists to deploy troops by helicopter. They picked Lt. Col. Hal Moore, a Harvard graduate with an International Relations degree, to command the newly redesigned Airborne, 7th Cavalry. The first half of ""We Were Soldiers"" follows Moore as he acclimates his troops to helicopters. He instills in one young officer, Second Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein of ""Rollerball""), the importance of caring for his men. Veteran Sergeant-Major Basil Plumley (scene-stealing Sam Elliot of ""Dog Watch""), who prefers his reliable .45 automatic pistol to the new M-16 assault rifle, shadows Moore.<br/><br/>Flying Moore's men into combat is ace chopper pilot Major Crandall (Greg Kinnear of ""As Good As It Gets"") in his best ever action role. Wallace provides glimpses of Moore's home life with his wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe of ""Bad Girls"") and their five rambunctious children. Inevitably, when President Johnson orders them into action, our heroes¬óall 395 of them-wind up in the Valley of Death pitted against 4000 NVA regulars during a devastating three day engagement. The bullet-riddled second half of ""We Were Soldiers"" climaxes in Vietnam with savage hand-to-hand combat.<br/><br/>Covering ground similar to Ridley Scott's superb ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""We Were Soldiers"" boasts not only more heart and soul, but it also exhibits bouts of grisly violence. Mel Gibson needs to make more movies as exciting and entertaining as ""We Were Soldiers."""

Who could have guessed that he had a family that he had to leave, to go to war. It was crap.

","This movie has a soul. <br/><br/>It shows respect for the American Soldier.  It isn't politically correct among many, including some of the posters here to do that it seems.<br/><br/>Pity those who can't grasp the concept of men who believe there are things bigger than themselves and who bet their very lives on that belief.  The film accomplishes this tribute to the soldier by also giving due to the NVA Regular who fought with bravery. Nothing shows the nobility of a fighting man than by showing the quality and courage of his opponent. Like Colonel Moore says in his prayer however, he understands their humanity to a degree but wants them to die in battle and not his men.  That's compassion laced with a real world understanding of how things are.<br/><br/>Men who throw themselves on grenades, who charge into enemy fire, who while wounded themselves risk themselves again to save a comrade are not Hollywood cliches.  There are countless citations of such acts made from Breed's Hill to the Sunni Triangle.  With the Sunni Triangle, it's happening as I type these words.  <br/><br/>Kinear did a fine job showing the humor that is so common among men in the military.  Sheppard caught the spirit of the professional Sgt. Major, Barry Pepper displays well a time when an American journalist saw that he was first an American and then a reporter.<br/><br/>This movie captures the worth and nobility of the typical American soldier. <br/><br/>
By the way, the only reason we have a film industry that produce films from all perspectives is because the American soldier made it possible. And this holds true for every nation in the world where films are made that are not censored by their government.  Because if it wasn't for the United States and her soldiers, freedom wouldn't exist anywhere.<br/><br/>Remember that when you eat your popcorn."

","Like another viewer has said, it is indeed difficult to write 10 lines on this garbage.<br/><br/>The story may be true or not, this movie was bad. Lame, despite all the fireworks. The music? So boring! Sentimental schmaltz stuff of the worst degree, creating NO atmosphere whatsoever, only seconding the sorry pictures.<br/><br/>By judging from the battle scenes, I expected that at least say 250 out of the 396 or so have died. Instead there were only 71 dead as we learn at the end. Sorry, but I had to laugh, the battle pictures we've been shown by the director seem not correspond to this relatively low casualty count. And of course we never learn how many enemy men were mowed down. This battle has only one side...<br/><br/>Another idiotic scene: One of the first guys (some Lieutenant) coming in with the first wave spots an enemy scout and immediately runs after him for into unknown enemy territory, but not only for a few meters but he keeps on chasing and chasing until finally the men draw fire. Worst of all, he drags all his men with him!! I mean how stupid a military leader can you possibly be?? Again, this may be a true incidence or not, but if a soldier behaves so stupidly, he doesn't deserve any better than getting whacked. I only felt pity for the poor fellows who had to follow their ""leader"" and got mostly killed in the process as well.<br/><br/>What happened to Madeleine Stowe?? Did she see a plastic surgeon to get her lips siliconed? Not sure, but she looked terribly bad here, suddenly has grown old in her face. And I do not believe that this was due to the ""burdened"" role she had to perform here. Her character was to forget about anyway, like all the other clich√© soldier babes who looked all so good and shiny of course... All BS for me. The only one credible character in this sorry flick was the UPI photographer (Pepper?), the sharpshooter from Private Ryan. I really like the guy, he has a good intensity on screen.<br/><br/>I could go on ranting some more, but I could only repeat what other viewers have said already. I rate this crap a 2 out of 10. I give it 2 only because some (not all!) of the battle scenes seemed credible enough, especially the one night attack where the soldier says he can ""smell 'em"" and they light up the forest and indeed the enemy is right at them already.<br/><br/>Hamburger Hill is the much, much more touching and engaging film."

","I was curious about this movie because it's one of the more ""recent"" Vietnam movies so I wanted to see if it brought anything new to the table that the classic movies did not. <br/><br/>The movie opens with a French patrol in Vietnam in 1954, the final year of the First Indochina war. The French patrol is overrun by the Viet Minh forces and the commander order to ""kill all they send, and they will stop coming"". We fast forward 11 years when the United States is fighting the Vietnam War. Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) arrives with his family and is very dedicated to training his troops in preparation to be sent to battle. He will be leading a newly created air cavalry unit (flying troops and supplies in with helicopters) into the Ia Drang Valley. Moore only has 395 men at his disposal and soon learn that the enemy has much more men. Vastly outnumbered, will the astounding leadership qualities and stubborn determination of Moore be enough to survive the coming onslaught?<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this movie, but not tremendously. The war action was very good, the acting and portrayal of the characters was decent and at times it gave me the feeling of being in the heat of the battle. But it started really slow, the first 40 minutes were not very interesting and although it did setup some story arcs, overall it could be much shorter or be made more exciting. In my opinion they tried to hard with focusing on the families of the soldiers. I understand that they wanted to show how the women left behind would react to the bad news but it didn't work for me, I think they should have stayed with the battle the whole movie. <br/><br/>And where most classic Vietnam movies focus on the insanity of war and the dehumanization, this movie sometimes looks like a commercial to join the army. There were a bit to many ""I'm glad I died for my country"" moments and it lacked emotional torment of the characters. On the other hand they did a fine job showing the Vietnam troops as real people and not as nameless monsters. <br/><br/>Overall it is a decent movie but it doesn't do anything new and doesn't hold a candle to the classic Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket."
"Arthur21743","10","1","2","5 June 2014"," Vietnam -- Its Legacy, Its Lessons for Us Today
","This film touched my heart in the way it showed the valor, the commitment, the utter devotion and supreme dedication of those whose awful task it was to go to Vietnam and suffer and die, or suffer and live (in many cases a fate worse than death), all for nothing. Well, it wasn't exactly for nothing, was it?. Many made fortunes off that war, and it is the contrast of the dedication of these great patriots, misguided and downright misled though they were, with the behind-the-scenes corruption and greed that used Communism as an excuse to wage a no-win war at the expense of human life that I wish to address.<br/><br/>I must say the movie did a good job in portraying just how awful it was to have to endure all that over there in Vietnam, and it gave me a new respect for those who went through it all.<br/><br/>Frankly, I didn't make it past the first jungle scene or two before I had to switch off. I couldn't bear to watch all that suffering and dying... all in vain. I was looking at this story of the war in Vietnam with hindsight, since I knew how it was going to end, and my heart groaned over that waste of human life that was going to accomplish nothing good. We were never meant to win.<br/><br/>Vietnam stank of Machiavellianism on an international scale.<br/><br/>Niccolo Machiavelli was a sub-human parasite. He lived in the 1700's I believe. He was a master at profiting from wars and disputes between peoples. If there was no conflict going at the moment he would try to instigate one, and then pretend to befriend both sides behind both their backs. By controlling the purse strings he could keep each side from getting too dominant and annihilating the other, thereby destroying that side's ability to pay off the war debt and also keeping the conflict alive as long as possible. Can we see any resemblance to the Vietnam war here? People back here at home smelled a rat and hated the war. Maybe they couldn't put their finger on the problem, but they knew something was deeply wrong. There was some talk about America having lost her resolve to make the world safe for democracy. Why should the world's greatest power not be able to bring a two-bit country like North Vietnam to its knees, they wanted to know, and couldn't articulate why not.<br/><br/>It wasn't about resolve, it was about money, and sacrificing human life to feed the economy and line the pockets of the ones who stood to gain at the expense of our fighting men's very lives. The problem is that some of those people who opposed the war also hated our own soldiers for participating in the war. It is in the honor of those valiant men that this review is dedicated. They were patriots and should never have been mistreated by their own, no matter how misguided or exploited they were. They didn't question, they just obeyed. They followed orders, as they were taught to do.<br/><br/>I can't speak for the Army of today, but I can tell you about how it was back in the sixties. Independent thought was discouraged. You were taught to follow orders without question. Military life may always be so. It always has been, that's for sure. I remember one of the Dirty Dozen movies where there was a mission given the dozen to kill some general who planned to assassinate Hitler. The sharpshooter had the general in his sights but the problem was that Hitler was there too, and he thought Hitler made a better target. I remember Lee Marvin's character saying several times, ""Just the general"".<br/><br/>He knew that the higher ups in America wanted Hitler alive so he could keep on making his strategic blunders and keep on losing the war for his country. But would Marvin's character confide that to his sniper underling? Not on your life. Just obey orders and do not ask questions was his approach to command.<br/><br/>When I took an oath upon joining the Army I remember I had to sign a paper giving up my rights under the Constitution of the United States of America, especially that of free speech. We were ushered into another room after the swearing-in where it was explained to us that we were now property of the U.S. Army. ""GI"" stands for government issue. You became a part of the weapons arsenal, with your own serial number, even. The power and control that is exerted over you is deep and intense. It is hard to imagine what pressure these men who went to Vietnam were subjected to in order to get them to fight this awful war.<br/><br/>All I can say for those poor, blind, and misguided souls who fought in Vietnam is may God bless them, both living and dead. I deeply appreciate their unselfish devotion to their country and to the oath they swore¬Ö.<br/><br/>And the opposite for all those who exploited them for financial gain."

","I loved this movie. Some of the most believable acting I've ever seen. It's a sad movie with an insight into war that is not often offered to viewers of war/epic movies. The cast is excellent with legends such as Mel Gibson. This very heart wrenching and emotional movie has a slight comical element provided by Sam Elliot. I, being a fan of epic and war movies, had huge expectations for this movie and they were exceeded. Being based on the true story of when a group of around 400 American soldiers go into battle against almost 4000 Vietnamese soldiers in the valley of death in 1965, it truly shows viewers what war is really like, something many of us will never have to experience. It's non stop action with amazing effects but there is always the overwhelming sadness and awareness of the circumstances. We never forget about the wives back home or the children who will now grow up without fathers and this awareness is just emphasized by the fact that part of the movie is of the families receiving news of death and their reactions, often making viewers cry themselves. The viewers are in fact, so involved that the loss of a character feels like a loss to the viewer. Every single character is developed, even the Vietnamese. There are no heroes in this movie, although shown from American perspective the viewer is made aware of the fact that the Vietnamese may not be there by choice and also have families back home that will go on living without a husband or father. I was impressed by the fact that the film was made with the input and advice of the real Lt. Col. Hal Moore and widows of the deceased soldiers, making it just that little bit more real. With an overwhelmingly emotional yet exciting story and a bittersweet ending what more can you ask for? I, myself, did not cry as the only movie I've ever cried in is Braveheart(I'm not very emotional) but my entire family and friends were sobbing throughout. This movie is one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen and has left a lasting effect and impression on me. This movie just shows that with a duo like the incredible Mel Gibson and the amazing Randall Wallace, there are no mistakes. 10/10 I highly recommend it to anyone."

If you like war movies, you will find this movie worthy to sit down and view. The only problem I see with this film is that it feels like a combination of good scenes and lines from other films. The apolitical analysis of war in this film does not stand out from many modern war movies. The characters in this movie seem to speak dialogue that they would only speak when coming home from a war (or analyzing it when they became older men), not in the middle of it. That's not to say that most movies pull that kind of wording on the big screen, but this film felt a little forced (and sometimes cheesy). But check it out - You're best reason for checking this out: Sam Elliot. What an awesome actor!"
"compi24","7","1","2","23 September 2011"," Review Of ""We Were Soldiers""
","Randall Wallace's ""We Were Soldiers"" tells the story of the events that surrounded the first major battle of the Vietnam War. The film stars Mel Gibson, Barry Pepper, and Greg Kinnear. First off, the greatest aspect of this film is the really strong lead performances from Mel Gibson - He really shines in this role. Another impressive performance in the film is Sam Elliott's portrayal of Sergeant Major Basil L. Plumley. His character has some of the most memorable lines of dialogue in the film which are often crass and caustic. Another very memorable aspect of the film is it's intensely realistic use of special effects. The film uses special effects to simulate what the actual Battle Of Ia Drang was like. Some of the special effects are really engaging and compelling while other special effects are grotesque and grisly, but either way it helps to ground this film in realism. While a lot of the performances in the film were noteworthy, there were some that were. . .not. I'm not going to say which ones fell flat, but there were some moments when actors delivered their lines in a really unsuitable way. These moments don't really take away from the film's overall appeal, but. . .their just bad. All in all, I felt that ""We Were Soldiers"" was a fairly impressive film that crafted a very believable simulation of the first battle of the Vietnam War."

"wm28","6","1","2","6 August 2008"," A good step towards depicting the reality of war but not far enough
","This movie delivers the message ""not even the winner wins any battle"" very effectively. In addition, it is more realistic and showing more of the psychology of war, bereavement and fear than most American war movies do, creating a multi-dimensional picture of a sequence of events at wartime. Still, if psychology of war is the main issue (instead of the plot which is very simple in this case) it could have been a lot better if the movie had shown much more of the Vietnamese soldiers' psychology and understanding of the war. The way the Vietnamese commander is depicted is very shallow and stereotypical. In addition, there are some unrealistic happenings in the movie. First of all, a trained soldier, especially a commander of an infantry unit (Lt. Co. Hal Moore) would NEVER face enemy machine gun fire attack standing upright (with a handgun in his hand). Everyone MUST lie down in that situation to minimize risk of injury; if you join the army you learn that on the first week. I know it looks a lot more heroic and brave on the screen standing that way but doing that is plain stupid and irresponsible, an equivalent of playing Russian roulette. Second, if an infantry unit expects enemy attack waiting in a ditch, soldiers should not stand at whispering distance to each other. The defendants must keep at least 4-5 meters distance between themselves on the defense line, otherwise a single hand grenade may kill several of them at once. Again, that is probably a compromise movie makers made to create a more appealing outcome. To sum up, reality of war is a lot less romantic than most war movies, and still less romantic than this more realistic war movie; but I suppose people do not want to see reality of war in the raw because they are more inclined to enjoy a movie that reinforces their beliefs and stereotypes and which satisfies their romantic hero images and illusions. After all, movie makers want to make money, and I must admit they made an OK compromise on this one. One must keep in mind that this is still not a documentary, though."

"kstuard-1","8","1","2","27 November 2006"," critique of We Were Soldiers
","The true events depicted in We Were Soldiers make the movie just as much about emotion as the brutality of war. Based on the book We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young by Lt Col Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway about the first major battle in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, the film accurately depicts the bloody engagement of four hundred American troops against two thousand North Vietnamese soldiers. The movie was was written and directed by Randall Wallace. There were three producers of the movie; Bruce Davey, Stephen McEveety, and Randall Wallace. We Were Soldiers takes a unique approach to the war story as told by cinema. This movie addresses the emotional toll the war has on the soldiers during the fighting, and the same toll as felt by the families they left behind to serve this country. The beginning of the movie revolves around the establishment of relationships between the soldiers and their families, as well as the connectedness of all the families portrayed in the movie. In no time at all, however, the viewer is introduced to the gruesome reality of war. Almost upon landing at LZ X-Ray, the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (led by Lt. Col. Hal Moore) are surrounded by enemy forces. Some of those soldiers whom the viewer is led to believe to be the main ""characters"" are quickly faced with the bitterness of mortality, as they are not immune to incoming enemy fire. Despite the large number of ""characters"" introduced, it was pretty easy to follow each individual story. There were no inconsistencies in character portrayal throughout the movie, lest you count Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley telling Sgt. Ernie Savage, ""That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage"" after Savage is rescued. This is inconsistent with Plumley because at the beginning of the movie, Plumley regularly dismisses Savage's attempts at describing the beautiful mornings at base camp. Other than the said example, the rest of the movie flowed smoothly in its character portrayal.<br/><br/>Nick Glennie-Smith composed the music of We Were Soldiers. He delivered a highly passionate score filled with heroism and sadness. Every scene of heroism was filled with music set to inspire the viewer. Each scene of sadness was magically paired with a haunting piece of music. This can really be seen in the scenes in which Lt. Col. Hal Moore's wife Julie Moore delivers the telegrams to her friends and fellow wives. Or when 2nd Lt. Jack Geoghegan sacrifices his life to bring back a fallen soldier. The music is a perfect match to the movie. In We Were Soldiers, there are many instances of slow motion. This adds to the dramatic affect the director is looking to get from his audience. For instance, when Sp4 Galen Bungum and Sgt. Ernie Savage each kill a North Vietnamese soldier in hand-to-hand combat. The speed is slowed so that the viewer might really understand the soldiers' fight for survival in Vietnam, and realize the emotional impact that would be felt by the two American soldiers. Another scene was when Joe Galloway ran through the battlefield taking pictures of the dead, the wounded, and those in combat. Once again, this was done to allow the viewer to appreciate the full scope and magnitude of the fighting and sacrifice that happened in the Valley of Death. It was because of scenes such as these that really opened my eyes for the human need and want to survive. The will of these soldiers as portrayed by the actors was simply amazing. Such determination to keep the man standing beside them alive was truly inspirational. I think Lt. General Hal Moore had it right when he said, ""American soldiers in battle don't fight for what some president says on T.V., they don't fight for mom, apple pie, the American flag...they fight for one another."" We Were Soldiers could be argued to be a propaganda movie that tries to glorify the Vietnam War. However, I believe that purpose for the movie was to bring to light the sacrifices of the American soldier and his family during this time period. In the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, the authors write about Hollywood movies of Vietnam, and how they got it wrong every time. Randall Wallace (director, writer, and producer of the movie) only sought to get it right. Though I wasn't even alive during the Vietnam War, I believe Wallace and his crew got it right, for once. The movie We Were Soldiers is a very probable movie. For one, it is based on actual events that occurred at the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Also, the movie is based on the nonfiction, documentary book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young. The special effects, the raw emotion, and the outstanding acting made this movie very believable. On a scale of one to four, four being the highest, I would rate the movie a four, for reasons found throughout this critique."

","First a Disclaimer; I was not old enough to be involved in the Vietnam War, but was old enough to see all that went on at that time, my father being active duty at Paris Island in the Sixties, I grew up in the military community. Even if that had not been the case, I would hope that I could have watched We Were Soldiers and been objective as to it's premise. I emphatically contend that this is the ultimate, most compelling looking glass into what went on during that terrible time. The naivet√© of the men who left was all too real. By the end of the movie, as with the war, our innocence was lost. As other reviewers have stated, the violence was indeed graphic but I do not believe it was gratuitous. Please, if you need to understand what the Vietnam War was about, at least on the ground, through the eyes of the men who really fought it, SEE THIS MOVIE!"

","As a war movie, this was breathtaking, showing heroism on the part of soldiers, which is what war movies do. The ending where Kinnear shows up and zaps the North Vietnamese with Gatling guns. Where were these guns before? The artillery did a great job, and the ability to call in air strikes almost instantaneously was amazing. In the story arc, it was interesting to contrast the Mel Gibson plan, which he learned from the French who did it wrong by being passive, to take the battle to the enemy when they least expect it. If we had not given up politically, we could have won the war in Vietnam. Sam Elliott was his usual great gruff self. Mel was often melodramatic and the women back home were stereotypes and Madelaine Stowe had the worlds biggest lips."

"notcliched","6","1","2","20 March 2005"," Nothing special
","Vietnam War films have always tried to capture the horrors of war, especially the personal horror of those involved.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers was somewhat of an enigma. On the one hand, it tried to be anti-war like most, if not all, Vietnam War films. However, at the same time, it was stupidly 'patriotic' to the point where it becomes just another pretentious American tripe. It was also extremely biased. Whereas films like Platoon showed the atrocities committed by both sides, We Were Soldiers has every American soldier with a halo above his head.<br/><br/>Filled with cheesy lines and silly American gung-ho attitude, it's hard to take this film seriously and as a result, its message comes across very weakly (not that its message is very well developed or anything new). A highly predictable ending doesn't help things either.<br/><br/>The scenes of Gibson's wife (played by Madeleine Stowe) back home, as an attempt to show the affects of the war on the families of the soldiers, were poor, underdeveloped and a bore.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the fighting is strong and exhilarating. The battle of tactics between Mel Gibson and the Vietnamese leader was very interesting.<br/><br/>A watchable film with one or two good performances, but nothing special."
"Artdoag2","7","1","2","5 February 2005"," the untold story of the early years of Vietnam
","This is a solid war movie, and I enjoy watching it once a month. Well, given the fact that I am a Huey junkie, the chopper scenes certainly help. A friend of mine commented, ""Well, it's strange, the soundtrack to the movie is tribal in nature, and there's no memorable Sixties' tunes, like in other Nam movies."" I explained to him that WWS to place in 1965, about a year or two before the huge appearance of the anti-war movement, and certainly predating the hippie movement, so these elements weren't meant to appear.<br/><br/>A lot of it is fictionalized, but then again, so were many aspects of Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan (some of the only worthwhile modern war movies in about the last twenty years). We Were Soldiers tells the rather un-hip story of the early Vietnam years, so, I must state again, that this is why you don't hear any tunes from the Rolling Stones, The Doors, or Zeppelin. That's 1968 onward... I guess... and WWS does a commendable job.<br/><br/>The uniforms are right on target with the 1965-66 timeframe. The choppers used featured equipment and weapons that wouldn't appear until a year or two later, but that's OK. The combat scenes capture the essence of the fighting, and thankfully no retarded cuts or zooms were used. However, we don't see a single M14 rifle (the precursor to the M-16, which is seen all over the place in WWS), as most of the troops would have been using them as the M16 wasn't fully deployed to units at that time. But the best thing I can say is that the characters of 2LT Geoghan (or whoever), SGM Plumley, and SGT Savage look incredibly like their real-life counterparts, as far as i could tell in the photo section of the novel. That kind of accuracy is commendable. The true-to-life events, such as the airstrike, are well done.<br/><br/>I do have some gripes though... having served in the Army (1996-2001), there are some shortcomings that I am able to spot. There is not enough development given to make enough of the supporting characters memorable. This worked in Black Hawk Down, but not here. Plenty of faces appear beyond the top and second-billed characters, but something was missing. I would have liked to see more of Too Tall (the other pilot), Godbolt (the black dude), Jimmy Nakawama (got burned bad) and CPT Nadal (""we have an American Platoon... OUT THERE!""). They're mentioned plenty of times, and they function to give what I call their ""partner character"" some depth, but they themselves either appear, disappear, or don't have enough lines. Also, the sound is not terribly well-mixed as some of the dialogue is muffled, and the editing is about average. Some key scenes take place in near darkness, so knowing who's who as well as the emotional impact is missed.<br/><br/>One thing that really irks me is.... the lack... no, the absence of the portrayal of black soldiers. PFC Godbolt is Geoghan's partner character, but he doesn't get a single line. He looks like a nice guy, throws a grenade, gets shot, dies. Obviously, black soldiers made up quite a bit of the Army in 1965 (and even now.... almost pointless to say) but there's no representation of them (I Don't MEAN ""THEM"" IN A BAD WAY, OK??) except for Godbolt's wife back home. The Asian soldier, Jiimmy Naki-something, appears, for like a split second in the beginning, then runs into Joe Galloway (I cant remember the guys name) during the attack. The he gets wounded. He's about the only minority who gets a line. Both he and Godbolt were real people...hmmmm.... The voice-over narration is used very spottily, and this coulda been polished up. Finally, there is a mention of ""losing a boatload of draftees is a bad week"": the draft wasn't in effect until 1969.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, WWS is a solid war movie that tells the lesser-known era of the Vietnam involvement. Yeah, everyone knows about the hippies, the peace signs on the soldier's helmets, the out of reg uniforms, the negative attitude, but these are staples of Nam movies that take place later in the war. I wouldn't mind seeing a movie made that deals with the later years of the war (say, 1972). Plus Madeline Stowe does a good job in as supporting role. Plus she looks real cute when she does that flinch/double take when the cab guy arrives at her door.<br/><br/>On par with BHD or SPR? No. But it is on the level of Platoon, Glory, and Hamburger Hill. 7 of 10"

","Despite the good intentions, this film remains a pointless and counter-productive exercise. There is no genuine dramatic content to speak of and the idea of trying to shock with the bloody horror of war is neither sufficent to the study of the historic subject nor effective in a target culture decensitized to graphic violence; ultimately the violence is pornographic, and nothing more. The principles of leadership communicated in this film, which were apparently the whole point of the director making it, are also extremely narrow. The director, on the basis of his DVD commentary, was obviously full of good intentions, but has failed in producing a film of any merit.

However watching it, there is no balance of the perspectives, and a whole lot more film time is dedicated to the plight of the US soldiers. The wives plight seems a bit thin in it's development, as does that of the N. Vietnamese. It might aswell just stick to it's roots and be a war-film, rather than try to branch off into being a drama.<br/><br/>I got the impression as-well that it was trying to touch on racism and multi-culturulism, but once again failed to develop these themes.  After the initial 45-minutes of the film, it descends into the war scenes, and seems to forget everything that it's just been trying to get across.<br/><br/>That said however, Mel Gibson does remain pretty constant throughout the film, and his character is well-developed. He just doesn't seem to sit right in a war film though. His character is supposed to be a man who feels the pressure of history and leadership on his shoulders, and in this role Gibson excels. But he comes across in his usual Mr. Nice Guy way, which doesn't fit the tone of the war scenes.<br/><br/>I'd of prefered this film to have been longer so that more time could of been allocated to the development of it's different themes. I'd of also prefered to have seen the N. Vietnamese commanders character, and Gibson's wifes' character developed more. There just seems to be not enough main characters in the film. The war reporters character is very strange aswell, his is a character that needs developing the most. The film isn't a bad film, it's just trying to be too many things at once, and failing to be them. Watch it for Gibson's performance and the action sequences, not the more deeper stuff."
"esbenpost","Null","1","2","23 September 2003"," My basic thoughts on this film
","In America, WWS got good if not great reviews and was viewed upon as a realistic war-movie with a heart, set in the Hollywood tradition (read for example the Roger Ebert review). In Europe the critics were a lot more sceptic about the movie, they saw it as badly timed propaganda, filled with clich√©s and unnescessary violence. Personally I find myself in-between. The question I asked myself when I saw this movie is: what makes a hero, and under what circumstances is it allright to make war-movies as this which are plainly NOT anti-war. In WWS the message is clear: what makes you a hero is fighting for your comerades (be they American or North Vieatnamese) and your country. So - were the soldiers of Nazi Germany heroes ?? Can you be a hero if you're fighting on the wrong side ?? Today I think most people feel that the US Army's presence in Vietnam was unjust. The south-vietnamese regime they were fighting for was no worse and no better than the north-vietnamese they were fighting against. For the soldier though, this didn't matter. He was, as the movie states, fighting for himself, and his comrades. But for the viewers watching the movie, this SHOULD matter. WWS is not an anti-war movie. It gloryfies armed combat. But combat itself is not glorious, and dying for your comerades is - if it's not in the service of a just cause - meaningless. The both scary and fascinating thing about WWS is that it COULD have been about Nazi soldiers, or north Vietnamese, and it would still have had the same pathos and the same message - which is, again, not about right or wrong, but self-sacrifice."

","I took the propaganda with a grain of salt.  And the blood & guts.  Even the families on the home front.  To me, the movie was all about the relationships between the men, & loyalty to their leader (& vice versa). The men fought & died for each other.  In that way, it reminded me of ""K-19: The Widowmaker,"" & ""Glory."""
"Angry_Arguer","8","1","2","21 July 2003"," They Just Don't Get It
","On my initial review of this movie, I thought it was spectacular.  I withdraw that comment now.  Randall Wallace fills this movie with so much politically-correct garbage (compared to Hamburger Hill and Platoon) that I wonder what Mel Gibson was thinking when he signed on to this.<br/><br/>As far as imitating Saving Private Ryan, WWS fails gloriously because it doesn't understand the *horror* of war.  Violence in Private Ryan is meant to be unflinching and realistic; here Wallace (and Gibson) flinch a lot. This is obvious in the full-color fighting complete with typical Hollywood setup.  There is no sense of reality, only distance.  Not even John Woo and Ridley Scott understood the concept in their movies.  Thereby, as far as the next generation of war movies is concerned, I approve of Private Ryan far more than any other.  Especially this.  The use of slow-motion and drowning out the sound for the cliche, gung-ho music was not a bright move and reduced this to an action movie...not a war movie.  Coppola and Stone understood the VietNam scenario better than anyone else.  Hence, they made better products.  While that is in the eye of the watcher, my opinion trumps all since this is my review.<br/><br/>Overall, stick with previous war efforts for a better understanding.  This is only for die-hard Gibson fans or those who failed high school American history.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

","A pumped up Mel Gibson, a group of desperate warriors, massively outnumbered and Scottish folk music. All that's missing is the blue woad. But no this isn't just Braveheart re-visited it's actually one of the best war movies I've ever seen. For a Englishman I have a healthy curiosity about the Viet Nam war and the films that have been made in it's memory. I love the OTT imagery and metaphor that make up Apocalypse Now and the pathos and tragedy of Platoon and the Deer Hunter. This movie has more in common with the John Wayne vehicle Green Berets although this is no weakness. It both celebrates the courage and challenges the waste of war. You get the perspectives of the women left behind and the VC in their network of tunnels. Everyone is losing something in this scenario, life, loved ones or honour. Gibson's character is almost too good to be true and that makes you believe in him - Hollywood would never make up a character like this. This means though that you do care and even though the body count gets very high indeed in the extremely well presented battle scenes it never becomes gratuitous. This is a balanced war movie that actually cares about the story behind the battle. It's well made, acted, scored and feels real enough top make you cry, cringe and laugh. A recommended and sorely under-rated film."
"Alex-372","Null","1","2","12 December 2002"," Plei Ku, Blood & Guts
","This is a movie that is terribly conflicted. On the one hand, it wants to show the realities of war, both in it's effects on the soldiers at the front, and the loved ones they leave behind. On the other, this post-911 production wants to do nothing more than to wave the stars and stripes, going to almost ridiculous extents. There is ample use of WWII era Hollywood cliches in this movie.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the videocover/poster for this movie. Mel Gibson looks so mean and intense that he's almost caught a second before spitting out a big wad of Redman's. Hilarious, leaning towards high camp.<br/><br/>The dying soldier's ""Please tell my wife, I love her"" has already been mentioned.<br/><br/>Then there is the Sam Elliott's super-gruff sergeant in charge (""Good morning, sergeant"". Reply: ""How the f*** do you know what kind of morning it's going to be?"").<br/><br/>And then there is the title. ""We Were Soldiers"" is a lot more assertive than the original, more melancholy title, ""We Were Soldiers Once, And Young"".<br/><br/>And lastly, there is the misplaced sounding Scottish music, that seems to want to create a connection in the viewer between this movie and ""Braveheart"", Mel Gibson's other epic about bloodshed and heroism.<br/><br/>However, all this said, the battle at Pleiku was most definitely a historical one. It set the US military doctrine of the use of airmobile units, and created a battle which the high command (General Westmoreland) more than anything wished to emulate over and over. The reason was that it resulted in a ""kill ratio"" of about 40 to 1. For every US soldier killed, 40 Vietnamese died. Eerily enough, it is also the death toll/ratio for the entire war (58,000 American deaths for 2,000,000 Vietnamese deaths). The battle at Pleiku started off America's serious involvement in the war in 1965, which until then had only been fought by the proxy use of Special Forces ""advisors"", and which would only end 8 years later in 1973, making it America's longest war by far.<br/><br/>So in summation, it started of the US's involvement in Vietnam, and also set the official military doctrine that would haunt the conflict for it's duration - a mobile conventional helicopter war, attempting to draw out the Vietnamese regular forces into a confrontation in which US air and artillery power would win the day. During the Tet offensive of 1968, Westmoreland was still waiting for a Vietnamese all-out assault. On the other hand, you can argue that the 40-1 kill ratio set the objective in the Vietnamese military's mind for the need to close that gap - kill more Americans and hide their own deaths as much as possible.<br/><br/>What is also clear from the movie, is what a waste war is and how criminal it is to fight things out on the battle field, when the obvious solution is political and economic. There was a, perhaps understandable, misreading of the nature and desires of Ho Chi Min, and the old Vietminh freedom fighters. There was also not enough effort to distance themselves from the old colonial legacy left by France and England, especially in their backing of the old exploitative, feudal system and their a priori failure to support or introduce transparent, democratic government. At the same time, seeing the enormity of Vietnamese sacrifice, it is hard not to consider how well the South Koreans have done out of compliance with the USA. In short, the issues that were thrown up during the Vietnam conflict would never be addressed on the battlefield, and the battle at Pleiku set the stage for the military conflicts to come. To understand what went wrong by an over reliance on waiting for the Vietcong to come to them, and why going after the Vietcong without proper intelligence was like catching fish with a spoon, read ""Slow Burn"" by Orrin DeForest, ""A Vietcong Memoir"" by Troung Nhu Tang or ""Stalking the Vietcong"" by Stuart Herrington.<br/><br/>All said, a pretty good war movie."
"gbheron","8","1","2","11 December 2002"," Grim War Movie - This Time 'Nam
","Continuing a trend in war movies; that of using state-of-the-art special effects to recreate the carnage of battle, Hollywood has now provided us its first entry for the Vietnam War. This follows World War II (Saving Private Ryan) and the Somali conflict (Black Hawk Down). Like ""Black Hawk Down"", ""We Were Soldiers"" is based on fact, written by the American commander of the famous November 1965 battle that heralded the start of large-scale American combat participation in the war. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the filmmakers spend more time developing the film's major characters than did Ridley Scott in ""Black Hawk Down"" (which was my only complaint of that excellent movie). The difficult lives of the soldier's spouses are dramatically (and theatrically) portrayed to excellent effect. Over half the movie is reserved for the actual battle, and it's a grim and gory affair. We care for the soldiers, their wives, and families, and when the battle starts and the blood begins to spill, we, the viewers, are emotionally pulled apart. <br/><br/>This is a very straightforward film, the portrayal of a single large battle, and its effect on the combatants and their families. I highly recommend it, but if you are uncomfortable with on-screen carnage, you'll want to avoid it."

","SPOILERS HEREIN!<br/><br/>Well, this is not a serious and compelling war movie like the Platoon was. Rather than that it resembles Saving Private Ryan in many ways. We need to thank these movies for one major thing. They portray the war in the naturalistic way. I can imagine someone may walk out of the theater after seeing some scenes of this movie, but hey, the war is even hundred times more gross than any movie can be. But starting with Saving Private Ryan, the trend to unleash the evil spirit of war and bring it to the movie screen started and this movie continues in it, and does pretty well. Also I liked, that the movie did not try to bring up any philosophical aspects, just shown the plain war, nothing more but also nothing less. Also the music is well written and accompanies the movie nicely, particularly I liked the main song.<br/><br/>But then there comes the bad stuff. And that is the plot - well, although I definitely must give some credit to the writer for leaving out the usual Vietnam controversy stuff, there are numerous other unnecessary scenes, such as American flag waving in the highest emotional scenes, it has been currently some kind of fashion in the movies of this type, but is it REALLY THAT necessary? Also the scene with the soldiers gathering at the airport in the middle of the night to leave for Vietnam - come on, give me a break! And final, and the worst - why the heck Moore first leaves two thirds of his men die in the hellish battle and then second day suddenly calls for the airstrike? Does that make ANY sense whatsoever?  And then, am I the only one who thinks the soldiers behaved like monks in the monastery? No f-words, no profanity. Would that really happen in the situation like that? A bit unrealistic, at least for me.<br/><br/>So the conclusion - I have to praise this flick for the portrayal of the hell of war. But I also have to put it down for unnecessary scenes, unrealistic political correctness and some flaws in acting. Lets break it even then - 5/10"

These are both things common in WWII movies, but this is the first time I've really seen it in a Vietnam war movie. During this battle, it also was sure to show the Vietnam point of view as well. It showed how the battle played out like a chess game, colonels on both sides predicted each others moves. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Lt Colonel Hal Moore and Sam Elliot as Sergeant Major Plumley were both excellent. I think this was probably Greg Kinnear's finest performance ever as Major Crandall, the lead helicopter pilot. Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore back home was very touching. And all of the supporting cast really turned in great performances, making for a very realistic movie. The battle scenes were incredible, but gut-wrenching to watch.

"Rogue Leader","Null","1","2","16 September 2002"," What was the point?
","I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. The characters were engaging. The combat scenes were awesome and highly realistic. The special effects were top-quality and the place really looked like a battlefield. The performances were brilliant and the whole movie told an important message in displaying the horror and confusion of war.<br/><br/>But I suppose I've said more than enough about Black Hawk Down. And now it seems I have to find some plausible way to judge this pathetic excuse for a war movie. Come on! This was horrible viewing from the first minute!<br/><br/>Mel Gibson made his second mistake in choosing a movie. The first was also a war movie, namely The Patriot, which was even worse. I realize he chose it probably because it was going to be a Randall Wallace movie.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace once wrote a brilliant script that became Mel Gibson's biggest success ever, Braveheart. That story was compelling and momentous. Afterwards, however, Wallace succumbed to clich√©s when writing new scripts. He wrote Pearl Harbor and the less said about it the better.<br/><br/>At least this movie doesn't stink as much as Pearl Harbor did. However that's hardly a compliment. If they intended to show a realistic view of the Vietnam War, they did a shockingly poor job. The battlefield looked like they were fighting the Vietnam war at Montana. It didn't look like Vietnam at all! The special effects were mediocre. They even attempted to capitalize on Black Hawk Down by crashing a helicopter which paled in comparison to BHD.<br/><br/>By the way the whole point those soldiers were sent to that battlefield was to simply kill some enemies without any previous strategy and knowing it was a death sentence. This can be attributed to lazy writing.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson did his usual outstanding performance. However when stuck with a boring character you can only do so much. Commander Hal Moore was the perfect hero with the perfect family and was never wounded in a firefight despite standing tall amongst wounded soldiers in the heat of battle barking orders.<br/><br/>At least Marc Blucas (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) got to die a very early death. I never liked his characters either on the movie or Buffy.<br/><br/>Another negative point I must comment on: I could predict who was going to die in the battle, because they always reused the annoying clich√© ""Tell my wife I love her"". If a soldier had a family or friend back home you could count the minutes to his eventual gruesome death, except for the movie's star hero, of course. And the endless minutes of Madeleine Stowe and Keri Russell delivering the letters to the wives of deceased soldiers wasn't compelling or dramatic in any way. It was excruciating.<br/><br/>Many people seemed to think this movie contained way too much blood and gore. Personally I think this movie deserves an award for being the war movie with the least amount of gore and blood that I've seen in my life. The war looked like summer camp in this movie. It paid no respect to the real events. After seeing Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down this was a real letdown! There was little or no blood nor gore. In war movies that's essential. If people complain about blood and gore simply by watching THIS MOVIE they probably didn't see the bodies falling down from the World Trade Center on September 11th.<br/><br/>The ending was even worse! After over an hour's worth of chaos and massive losses, American forces performed the miracle of overrunning the Vietnamise mountain and winning the battle. There's no plausible way this could have happened. This was the ultimate surprise in the history of unrealistic war maneuvers translated to a movie audience. Historically the only way American forces really affected Vietnamise forces was by flooding the whole jungle with loads of napalm. The movie's ending betrays history itself.<br/><br/>I hope Mel Gibson never considers doing a movie like this ever again. (I'm looking forward to Signs opening next Friday. It will bury this movie out of my memory)<br/><br/>Randall Wallace should go back to writing scripts for movies like Braveheart and never attempt directing or writing an American war movie ever again. Pearl Harbor and We were Soldiers were more than I could swallow."

I stick to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" (in that order) as my favorite war movies. Now those are movies that say a lot.<br/><br/>The thing that kept me from rating this movie with a 7 was the technical achievement of it.

","Why does everyone have to compare every Mel Gibson film to Braveheart?<br/><br/>Based on a book by the same title, it is a decent film that deals truthfully with the first major battle between US Army soldiers and the North Vietnamese Army. The book was written by Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper). The film is balanced in it's approach in that it is related from both sides. The way it was written shows a great deal of respect for the commanders and troops on both sides. It is brutally bloody, with liberal use of blood spatters on the camera lens and definitely earns it's R rating. It is a story of leadership and brotherhood. Before going off to 'Nam, Col. Moore (Gibson) tells his men that they will eventually be fighting for each other. During the training of his officers, he keeps stressing teamwork, brotherhood and respect for the men. The film continues to pound that thread home and all of the men learn to appreciate that fact in battle. This film is set in 1965, when the first combat troops were sent over to protect the advisors. The military wasn't prepared for the losses incurred; there was no plan in place to notify the families of those killed in action. Instead, the Yellow Cab company was used. I felt sorry for the cabbie in this film who had to deliver the bad news all too often. The film starts with us meeting some of the characters, their wives and children, so when bad news arrives for some of the wives, it's more emotional for the viewer as well. An altogether decent Vietnam film (FINALLY!). The acting is, for the most part, pretty decent, especially by Barry Pepper and Sam Elliot among the men and Madeline Stowe and Keri Russell among the women. The combat sequences are huge, prolonged, bloody and quite brutal, and it shows the bravery of both the American troops and the North Vietnamese as well. Those of us who weren't there can't possibly comment on how accurate this story is. In the special features, the men who were there say it's pretty accurate and I believe them. It's a significant film that's well worth a watch."

","We Were Soldiers is an intense drama set during the vastness of the Vietnam War. The story does not only focus on the grave depiction of this war, but also focuses on the lives of the American soldiers. The audience is able to realize that lots of these men who fought bravely were fathers to their children and husbands to their wives. They were willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of their country and fight for a nation they could be proud of. Mel Gibson is one of those soldiers (Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore) who must also leave his life behind and lead these young soldiers into the heart of doom. Writer/director Randall Wallace does a wonderful job at bringing the devastation of war and the emotion of soldiers to an even match and turns the film into an amazing portrait of the American spirit. He doesn't just make us absorb the harshness of war in which there is a good and an evil. Wallace makes us feel sorry not just for the American soldiers, but also for the enemy soldiers who are also sacrificing their lives for the good of their country. We realize that it is not their choice to fight in this war and are made to believe that it is a matter of duty and honor. Earlier in the film, Moore describes the soldiers as ""young boys"" who are being shed into a hellacious mixture of death and agony. This line allows the audience to feel proud for these young soldiers who fought for their nation. Moore also makes a promise that he will bring every man under his command home (dead or alive) ""so help him God"". We learn from this line at the end of the movie that Moore was indeed a man of his word and would die to see that these young boys made it home. Randall Wallace tells of the story of 7th company with such effectiveness and power that the audience must shed a tear at the end. Indeed, Wallace has improved himself ever since he wrote the disastrous screenplay for Pearl Harbor. I would not be surprised if this film was not recognized at the end of the year as one of the best films of the year. <br/><br/>Lenny's Grade: ***1/2"

Little scenes of the general plotting attacks is shown but only to show that the American counterpart is smarter and knows all the moves (which doesn't make sense in a true story movie). Movies like these are cultural and historical snapshots of what the acceptable opinion of the Vietnam war is now. Like all the big-budget war movies carved out of the same formula (and supposedly out of true events) Blackhawk Down, Pearl Harbor etc., it all paints a glorified view of war and a strong suggestion that it is superior intrinsic qualities that deservingly hands victory out of defeat's jaw for the home team."

","If you like military movies, you will definitely like this one.  Mel Gibson's character, Lt. Col. Moore, is one of the best speakers that I have ever heard.  It is not what he says that gets to you, it's how he says it. He is completely honest, he holds nothing back.  And he keeps his word. The movie would make anyone associated with the military proud.  You feel like you have a connection to all of the characters in this movie.  You feel the pain of the wives when they get the news of their husband's deaths, and the fear of the stranded soldiers when they learn that they are surrounded by Vietnamese troops.  This movie was truly breathtaking for me."

Have any of you even been in the military to make such a comment? I have 20+ years (Navy SeaBees and Army Infantry) and feel most of the action was very good. As one reviewer puts ""The battle scenes did not show us anything new"". Should Wallace had made up unrealistic battles scenes. I think too many of you are wanting the special effects to rule the movie. I will agree that some of the dialogue is ""hammed"" up but maybe some of you critics should include a better line in your review.

","We Were Soldiers has a few powerful moments and lots of sloppy cinematography.The way Moore was portrayed, many a time, I thought I was watching a hagiographic film. He may well be that saintly but the script went overboard in that respect. The fighting scenes were graphic but not very realistic.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Witness for example the last sequence when the Americans fixed bayonets and charged (I wonder if that actually occurred): exactly when they were running into a machine gun nest, suddenly, helicopter gun ships appeared out of nowhere to clean up the field (and somehow, the Vietnamese never heard them coming!) in a Rambo-like sequence. In another case that cannot be possibly historical, the bespectacled enemy soldier charged Moore and his entourage to be shot just when he was about to stab our bigger than life hero. Any sane soldier would just have stopped and shot everybody, or came on with gun blazing, but this one got a convenient brain cramp. <br/><br/>***END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>So in short, very disappointing though sometimes emotionally brilliant movie. And by the way, it is totally misleading to state that the battle pitted 400 Americans against 4000 Vietnamese. The truth is, 400 supported by air power and heavy artillery on the defensive against an enemy with no heavy weaponry actually is a winning odd in any battle."

","Excellent movie I thought, better than Black Hawk Down - better setup, more context.  A few things I have read about this movie - Galloway and Moore would not sell the story to Hollywood for quite a while, they wanted to be sure the story was treated with the proper respect, not turned into an anti-war screed, so they only sold the rights to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson when they were convinced the story would be told accurately.  The dialog is what was actually said, those who call it a cliche, what should they have done, change it to reflect someone elses idea of what would sound realistic?  <br/><br/>The movie is really about the code of honor among the men, the sacrafice they made, it makes no judgement about the merits of the war, those that complain about that definitely miss the point.  And of course, its about the American side, yes it treats American deaths with more feeling than NV deaths.  But there is some view of the other side, presented in a balanced manner.  Good job by Gibson, probably helps that he played a compelling character, and nice supporting role for Sam Eliot.  8/10"

","A pretty good war film, although not in the same class as SPR. This is essentially an actioner. The plot is historically driven but doesn't cut that deep.The great difference between this movie and other ""Nam"" flicks is that we see the American soldiers much as we have seen them in the earlier conflicts like Korea and WW2. There is none of the jaded attitudes, drug use, psychedelic meanderings and ""those folks back home don't understand"" mentality that appears in so many other movies based on the same conflict. This shows the American's as determined fighting troops, with a true professional soldier's mindset.An attitude that I believe, was the rule, not the exception,in the Vietnam conflict.It is a shame that so many other director's see fit to dwell on those negative aspects.For this reason alone, WWS is worth seeing.

"jastdi2","Null","1","2","20 April 2002"," That's the Way Soldiers Were in '65
","I am very impressed by this movie.  Soldiers of all ranks in '65 acted like soldiers: they followed their orders and looked after their comrades. They did so later in the war too. They talked in clich√©s: I recall my first night in Saigon in '66 being kept awake by some guy moaning, ""I don't want to die. I don't want to die..."" Just like a bad movie. But that's the way people really do talk. I am most impressed by the attention to detail in the combat sequences. Nothing is more annoying than seeing something wholly wrong in uniform or equipment in a war film that portrays itself as accurate. The advisors and those who bought the uniforms and equipment for this movie are to be congratulated on the Vietnam sequences.  If I have one cavel with this movie it is in the Ft Benning sequences where money was saved and the research faulty. Unfortunately this was up front in the film and got it off to a bad start.  Viz. Soldiers in the Foreign Legion from the rank of caporal-chef and up don't wear a white kepi; they wear black. Fatigues at Benning in '65 were starched solid; the film's fatigues dated from the '70's.  The issue baseball hat of '65 (assuming they weren't still wearing the pillbox, the timing is close) came to a strange point; the type shown in the film is, again, '70's issue (unless bought off-post in Columbus).  General Kinnard wouldn't have worn a blue infantryman's cord; that was a colonel's and below honor. I suspect any party at the O-Club would have been in Blues (required to be owned by all officers of the era), if not Whites -- a required uniform in '64 at Benning.  Lieutenants and captains of the era would have been living in housing one step up from trailer courts in Columbus and not in colonels' housing on post next to their battalion commander. This all made for a bad start which was wholly compensated for in the combat sequences. A neat movie"
"epkj","Null","1","2","14 April 2002"," So Close And Yet So Far
","""We Were Soldiers"" has all the elements of a great film. Unfortunately, it misuses those elements and fails in certain fundamentals. The primary problem with the film is lack of focus. For example, we are early on hit over the head with racial discrimination in the south during a meeting of officer's wives. Why? This is irrelevant to the film, which is about a particular battle, and not about the experience of living on a southern military base in 1965. This is a politically correct scene which was obviously inserted to show how much the people making the film ""care"". It serves no other purpose. The cutbacks to stateside to watch the telegrams delivered, apparantly while the battle is still raging, are distractions from the film's focus, which is the battle. I don't care about the wives. It is self evident that they mourned their husbands. There is no need to show this in a film about a battle. It would be appropriate in a film about dependants. Then we have the Rambo qualities of Colonel Moore and his Sergeant Major, who both stand upright during most of the battle hitting everything they shoot at. The Sergeant Major is particularly deadly with his pistol. That men might stand erect and escape such a battle unscathed is more plausible than that Colonel Moore and his Sergeant Major were so deadly with their weapons. Finally, the film self destructs when it attempts to make us feel sympathy for the North Vietnamese by equating them to us. They were the enemy. They represented immoral values, namely communism. They were not morally equivalent to Americans. This is actually an insult to Vietnam veterans. It says that they were killing good men with proper values. That makes the Vietnam veterans immoral, which they were not. Instead of making a film which shows the heroism of American soldiers, we are presented with a weak film which says that our soldiers are no better than our enemies and that our soldiers should hate themselves for winning! The one quote from Colonel Moore exemplifies the poor scripting in this film. ""I will never forgive myself for living when so many of my men died."" Well, Colonel Moore was a professional soldier, and most of his men lived! He did his job. Are we to believe that he expected no casualties? The statement he makes is appropriate to the sole survivor of a battle, not the leader of a victorious unit in which three fourths of the men lived. In conclusion, skip this film and see something better, such as ""Black Hawk Down""."

","As I sit here, I for the first time am having a hard time finding the proper words to describe We Were Soldiers. The movie definitely had an impact on me and I think it will definitely be a lasting one. From the moment the movie started I knew I was going to be in for a ride and I wasn't wrong at all. We managed to not only see some amazing actors come out of this movie but we also saw some amazing acting all the way around and, yet again, Randall Wallace has taken a trip through my mind and heart and has come out the other side leaving me a new person.<br/><br/>Personally a long Mel Gibson/Randall Wallace fan I knew what to expect from this movie and I was far from disappointed and in fact the movie was much better than I anticipated it being. The movie is based on the book `We Were Soldiers Once . . . And Young,"" by Lt. Gen. Harold, I have never personally read the book. Unlike many previous Vietnam movies, this one not only plays hard on action but also emotion and I know myself I was close, if not in tears on a few occasions during the movie.<br/><br/>We see some very dramatic moments in We Were Soldiers this was aided nicely with great music and a few heart turning slow motion moments. The movie doesn't only cover Mel Gibson's role nicely but also plays very well on his surroundings and surrounding actors. We saw a few great actors in this movie above and beyond Gibson's role as Moore but also in his wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) who plays the home front very well, with the position she plays we saw a great deal of emotion as she would handle the dispensing of death notices to the wives at home.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers definitely etched a few key moments into my mind and definitely had an overall heavy impact on me, take for instance the huge way we see that in fact the true people who fight the wars are generally he ones who hate it the most. This movie will cover three days in the valley of death, three days in which Moore and his men are greatly outnumbered about 10 ¬ñ 1. through out the movie we see key players loose there lives and we see the dramatic toll this takes on the soldiers, the movie definitely has a good sense of emotion mixed in to keep things from being strictly just another war movie.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was great, I couldn't recommend it highly enough, if you're a fan of Mel Gibson's or enjoy the directing Randall Wallace delivers then you should enjoy We Were Soldiers depiction of this battle. In all, the movie was great, and definitely worth the money! With the big actors this movie employed it's no surprise we see such an amazing movie here, definitely comparable to Black Hawk Down but that's not going to happen in this review, this movie deserves to be on it's own plateau in my mind not only for the solid acting but also because it really hit a key with me, perhaps it was the acting, the patriotism, or maybe the directing but something about this movie blew my mind."

","This is a very powerful and moving story, which really moved my parents and myself. It tells the story of a colonel, Hal Moore, who is determined not to let the Vietnamese soldiers massacre his people like they did the French ten years from the movie's setting. It tells the story of the 400+ men who fought a battle for three days in the ""Valley of Death"" (Landing Zone X-Ray) while surrounded by North Vietnamese soldiers.<br/><br/>However, this is not just your average war story. For a full hour of the movie, the backstory is told of these mens' families, wives, and children. Instead of seeing them as soldiers, we see them as actual people. And this is not just the American soldiers. The North Vietnamese are also humanized instead of seen as some faceless, nameless enemy.<br/><br/>This is a true story, based on the book ""We Were Soldiers Once...and Young"" by Harold Moore. The names of the people who died are in the Vietnam War Memorial and also play just before the ending credits of the movie. This gives the film a great impact, and I can't wait to read the book.<br/><br/>While the majority of the film after the first hour takes place in Vietnam, as the men fight, parts of it also take place in the States, showing the lives of the wives while, one by one, they learn of their husband's fate.

For him, this movie was not entertainment, not sappy, not too religious, not a Hollywood production, but a realistic, factual portrayment for HIS own life during that time.  As a medic in Viet Nam, he has seen every Viet Nam movie.

Even though I was thoroughly disturbed by the terrible violence being portrayed on screen, I didn't want the narrative to leave the intensity of the ongoing battle.  Because every time it did, we were subjected to the incredibly cheesy and TERRIBLE dialogue (""Where the metal meets the meat!!!"").  I understand the need for us (I'm American myself) to feel patriotic after the terrible tragedies faced this year, but glorifying ourselves in this over the top fashion, which attempts to find victory in a war we all now know was lost before it ever began, just does not seem the way to go about it.

","We were soldiers has got to be one of the best war films, I have ever seen. Though it is extremely full of cliche's it still gets a powerful lesson in history across. The Ia Drang valley battle was one of the worst that the US has ever been involved. I'm very surprised that anyone survived it, even with an outstanding officer like Hal Moore (gibson). The film also portrayed the Viet Namese in a better light than in most other films about that war.<br/><br/> Like I said the only problem I could find with this film is the many cliche's that appeared in it. The one that showed up in the film and has been absolutely done to death is the dying soldier lying on the field saying in a raspy voice: ""Tell my wife, I love her"" Actually the most common thing a dying soldier says is ""Tell my mother I love her"". Anyway as many cliche's as there are in the film, they don't even come close to taking away the power that this film had on many others in the audiences.<br/><br/> I've seen some great films on Viet Nam but this one has ranks right under Platoon. Platoon shows the sphycological hell that American soldiers in Viet Nam went through in that time period and We Were Soldiers shows the courage that fighting men showed throughout the war.<br/><br/> There is one thing that about We Were Soldiers that for me sets it apart from other films about Viet Nam. We Were Soldiers shows that soldiers returning from Viet Nam were given no parade or friendly welcome of any kind like the ones who returned from World Wars I and II. Infact, people who passed them in the streets ignored them entirely most of the time.<br/><br/> Now we get to the performances. I personally was impressed by all who acted in this film. Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot, and Greg Kinnear all gave memorable performances. However, one actor who really outdid himself was Chris Klein. I've never much liked Chris Klein because I've always felt that he is just a 23 year old playing a teenager. This film he has really shown himself as a serious actor.<br/><br/> Anyway great movie,"

This is a bloody movie though, so this movie isn't for everyone.  In the first 5 minutes you see a lot of blood, shooting and what not, but I guess that is to be expected with a war movie.

It's about Lt. Coloniel Hal Moore (portrayed by Mel Gibson) and other soldiers who have family, wife and kids go to war in Vietnam in 1965.  Hal and the other soldiers were surrounded by about two thousand or so of North Vietnamese soldiers and have to clear them out.  I liked the Hong Kong stylized violent sequences of this film because of the grapic war scenes were in slow motion instead of fast-paced.

While visually very powerful, it could easily have employed more of the technological tricks so many directors are unable to resist.  Instead, he relies on strong performances from his cast, and knew the story was truly extraordinary and did not need embellishments.  Gibson is no Olivier, and there are other actors who could have done better.  But Gibson gave it his all, and he did a fine job.  I do think the film will likely miss with many who aren't familiar with the book.  The bravery of the men and the ferocity of the battle, while all true, are truly unbelievable.

"Buddy-51","Null","1","2","16 March 2002"," simplistic but powerful war film
","World War II has been tagged by some with the rather oxymoronic appellation `the last good war.'  What this means is that the `heroes' and `villains' in this epic conflict were so clear-cut and obvious - and the goals so straightforward and crucial - that filmmakers approaching the subject haven't needed to bother much with exploring the moral complexities that lie at the root of all war, that most inhumane of human endeavors.  Films set in World War II have almost invariably reflected a sense of moral certitude, with the Allied nations seen as the forces of Good locked in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of Evil represented by the Axis powers.<br/><br/>This is not, of course, the way Americans came, for the most part, to view the Vietnam War.  Faced with no clearly defined enemy or menace, many Americans began to question their country's involvement in what seemed from a distance to be a civil war between two alien nations and cultures. Thus, when it finally came time for filmmakers to address this issue, their films naturally reflected much of the moral ambiguity that defined the nation as a whole.  Films like `The Deer Hunter,' `Platoon,' `Apocalypse Now' etc. not only questioned the moral rightness of our involvement and actions in that conflict, but actually made us question whether heroism - on the scale of the common soldier caught in the conflict - was even a valid possibility.<br/><br/>The new film, `We Were Soldiers' attempts to rectify that skepticism, trying to counterbalance the films like those listed above, while at the same time serving as a long overdue and honorable tribute to the brave young men who fought and died doing their duty on that strange foreign soil.  The film, thereby, endeavors to bring the WWII war film sensibility to one set in Vietnam.  In order to focus our attention on the individual heroism of the men involved, the film first has had to drain the narrative of its entire sociopolitical context.  Since this is the story of the first major battle between the Americans and the Viet Cong (which took place in November 1965) one would naturally expect to hear quite a bit of discourse - both among the military leaders and the rank-and-file combat soldiers - as to the why and wherefore of both the conflict and the Americans' reason for taking part in it.  Yet, we get none of this.  All the soldiers involved simply do their duty without question, an attitude which becomes, in effect, the film's operative definition of the word `heroism.'  This is what separates `We Were Soldiers' from those previous Vietnam War films.  The characters in those other movies were also dying bravely, but they always seemed to be questioning the powers-that-be that got them into the situation in the first place.  In `We Were Soldiers,' no one ever questions.  The need to follow orders is simply accepted as a given - and thus heroism becomes a matter of doing one's duty and of helping one's comrade regardless of any overarching justification for the slaughter.  Without having to wade through all the moral murkiness of the conflict itself, we are thus freed up to admire the sheer courage and determination of the men.  In fact, the film even makes a few good willed nods in the direction of equanimity by showing that even the Viet Cong fighters, who are attempting to kill all these fine young American men, also have girlfriends and families they love back home.<br/><br/>
Given this self-imposed myopia, `We Were Soldiers,' nevertheless, does an admirable job honoring these men.  Like most war movies, so much time is spent on the pyrotechnics of battle that little time is left to engage in any real character development.  `We Were Soldiers' attempts to flesh out its characters in the opening stretch when we see several of the men with their wives and families before embarking on their mission.  But once they hit the ground in Vietnam, all hell breaks loose and most of the men become lost in the chaos of this seemingly interminable battle.  The film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.  The carnage is appropriately gruesome and the filmmakers make sure that we see every last bit of the grotesquerie that the act of unbridled human butchery has to offer.  The special effects team has done an extraordinary job bringing all this to life on the screen.<br/><br/>Although a few of the early family scenes seem treacly at best, some of the film's most profoundly moving moments occur back home, when Julia Moore (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the film's protagonist, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), takes it upon herself to deliver the `death telegrams' to the other wives on the base.<br/><br/>Gibson does an admirable job as the man in charge of the mission, displaying both a rugged strength and a compassionate love for his men that makes him a well-rounded character.  One appreciates the fact that the writers, Joseph L. Galloway and Harold G. Moore himself (upon whose life and book this true story is based) don't require Moore to indulge in the kind of cheap theatrical heroics common to characters of this type.  He is a man whose level-headedness and grace under fire help lead his men on to victory in an almost impossible situation.  This is also a rare instance in which a character is allowed to have a religious dimension without being made into a fool in the process.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace, as the film's director, seems equally at home in the battle sequences and in the quieter moments of subtle sadness that permeate the scenes at home.<br/><br/>`We Were Soldiers,' for all its simplicity of theme, manages to be a moving tribute to the young men who found the personal courage to put their lives on the line, with or without a cause that made any sense."

","What all films should do, is tell a story.<br/><br/>This story was a difficult one to tell.<br/><br/>As an Englishman, Vietnam is not so much a part of my national identity as an Americans.<br/><br/>This film, based on real life events, really bought home the horror of that pointless conflict.<br/><br/>I say pointless, because I really believe that those young men fighting so bravely on both sides of the war, did not really understand why they were there.<br/><br/>This film clearly shows that they were honorable and brave, and that they were lucky to have such an inspirational leader in Col. Moore.<br/><br/>What it also shows is that politics are no replacement for tactics, and that soldiers should fight wars without political interference of the nature brought to bare in 1965.<br/><br/>It has been a long time since I walked out of a theatre with tears openly rolling down my cheeks, but I am proud to say that this film was worth every tear.<br/><br/>Well done to all concerned, and RIP all those brave young men who fell in The Valley of Death and beyond."
"RJBose","8","1","2","15 March 2002"," A Good Movie; More Importantly- Historically Accurate
","A great criticism I have for current movies is that in an effort to be more marketable (or ""politically correct"") actual events from history will be modified or distorted at the expense of the real people who were involved with the real events (last year's ridiculous ""historical"" farce ""Pearl Harbor"" springs to mind); there are enough genuine heros with true stories to tell.  Colonel Moore's in ""Were Were Soldiers"" (based on his book ""We Were Soldiers Once, And Young"") is one of these.<br/><br/>   Before I continue, let me first say that I was a freshman in high school when the Paris Peace Treaty was signed in 1973, resulting in the withdrawal of all US troops from South Vietnam, and a junior when the North Vietnamese Army invaded and overran the unprotected South in 1975.  Since that time I have studied Indochinese history in great detail, and have earned Master's degrees in both Asian Studies (South and Southeast Asia concentration) and International Affairs from the University of Michigan and Columbia University.<br/><br/>   The movie itself is well photographed and exhibits great expertise with battlefield verisimilitude and special effects.  More importantly, the film for the most part leaves political issues aside and tries to show us what Moore and his troops experienced those November days in 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley, and like it or not, whatever your opinions may be on US involvement in Vietnam, Moore's small, well trained force fought off and defeated far larger number of North Vietnamese Regulars in what was the first head-to-head combat between American and the invading Vietnamese Communist forces.  That's what happened.<br/><br/>   The North Vietnamese had hoped to inflict a large amount of casualties to alter American public opinion (which was very much in favor of the introduction of US troops).  The surrounded US troops used artillery and air support to repel the attackers, and killed more than 1800 NVA troops (total US battle deaths were around 300, including part of the later battle not shown in the film).  That's what happened.<br/><br/>   What was very significant about this battle was that it convinced the North Vietnamese generals to never meet American troops ever again in a conventional battle situation on that scale, (and they didn't). It convinced the US strategists that the way to beat the North Vietnamese (and their South Vietnamese Viet Cong proxies) was to try to lure large units into battle using American ground forces as bait, so that artillery and air power could be brought to bear and inflict unacceptable casualties, diminishing the North's ability and ardor for occupying the South.  This strategy (known as ""attrition"") did not work; the North Vietnamese stayed away from large unit action (as mentioned above) and they also did not care how many soldiers they lost; it's well known that there are 58,000 names of US war dead on the monument in Washington, DC, but the North Vietnamese war dead number two million by their own estimates.<br/><br/>   ""We Were Soldiers"" is not entirely free of anachronistic 2001-era moral pronouncements, however, as the scene referring to a racist ""White Only"" sign in a laundramat mentioned by an innocent officer's wife back at the base who thought it referred to the color of the fabrics permitted in the machines.  Had the scene ended with awkward looks, with the Black officer's wife present, it would have been a powerful moment.  The politically correct indignant speechifying, followed by the Black woman's pained, but Oh-so-noble reply was clumsy and dumb (discrimination against Blacks in North Carolina in 1965?! Imagine that!  Were these officer's wives supposed to be unaware of American history or the Civil Rights movement going on all around them?).  Some of the early scenes with Mel Gibson as the loving Daddy were a bit heavy handed too, I thought (""Daddy, what's a war?"" asks his daughter who could be type-cast for Cindy-Lou Who).  The movie goes out of it's way to be even-handed in its depiction of the North Vietnamese, and goes a little too far, in my opinion, but there is no denying that they were well trained, well disciplined and courageous in battle.  The real slaughter of that war was suffered by the South Vietnamese civilians at the hands of the NVA and Viet Cong, however, and most of whose commanders were apparently not as introspective as the defeated officer shown here.<br/><br/>   All in all standing alone as a movie it is bit gory, but exciting and entertaining.  As a ""war movie"" it is essentially accurate, and without the tiresome left-wing political overtones of ""Platoon"" ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Apocalypse Now"".  Too many people just don't know the real history of that time and place, but that November in 1965, that's what really happened."

If I ever go to war, I would want that kind of an officer commanding me.  This film reminded me of an Old John Wayne war film in a sense that it had a little bit of romance in it and Gibson's character reminded me of a little bit of John Wayne.  He stayed cool throughout danger and everybody respected him.  This movie tells it like it is.  Not a lot of foul language, nudity, and sex.  It was a straight story that shoots through the heart and tells the story of the many brave men who fought that day.  Some parts of the movie are extremely graphic however, so if any parents are going to take their underaged children to see it(not a good idea) they should take into consideration the R-rating.

It is a high-powered drama that allows you to join the soldiers from any age and any time period.

"Zonieboy","Null","1","2","12 March 2002"," They fought not for God....Country...But for each other.
","This was the core message of this movie. The first half of the movie disappointed me in that it felt like the old Hollywood of old a.k.a. WWII movies, Yo-ho bravismo. I think the director was trying to show Col.Moore as a thinking officer and I believe he was and is, and I am a huge fan of Mel Gibson and his works but the performance comes off and as too forced. Sam Elliott who is always great,comes off very good and believable in his role as the Sargeant Major.<br/><br/>One other critique is the set in the movie. The set gives alot of mood to the feeling of terrain and geography. Vietnam era movies such as ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" succeed admirably in this area. But in the words of Austin Powers in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"", quote: You know what's remarkable is how in no way does England resemble Southern California. I feel he could jump in here and say the same about this set.<br/><br/>But overall,the movie conveys powerful emotions. The dogged determination of the North Vietnam troops. It is a tad graphic at times but I feel it is justified to make the viewer relate to the story. The story makes you honor and respect those who gave their all for us and that we are forever touched by their lives lost. 7/10"

"cocaine_rodeo","Null","1","2","12 March 2002"," The best movie I've seen in years!
","This was an outstanding film. I couldn't have been more pleased while leaving the movie theatre. What I think makes this movie so great is that it focuses on the soldiers themselves, rather than what they are doing there, or why. I honestly think this is the best character development in a war movie ever (I would say the Deer Hunter, but that isn't really a war movie). Mel Gibson hasn't given a stronger or better performance since 'Braveheart'. i think he deserves a best actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Many of the reviews I have read have called Mel's performance as Hal Moore a cliche. That isn't true though, because that is the way Hal Moore really was then, and is now. That is what most people don't realize. Even if Hal Moore is a cliche himself, I don't care, because he is an interesting character, and Mel did a damn fine job at portraying him. <br/><br/>This, along with 'Platoon' and 'Braveheart', is my favorite war movie, and one of my favorite films. This movie captures (or so I'm told) the horror and tragedy that goes on on the battlefield of Vietnam, or most any war, as best it can, because it would be impossible to capture the 'real' terror in a movie, because the real terror happens within each individual soldier, and that is probably scarier than anything else on earth. <br/><br/>What I really liked about this movie, and what makes it so unique, is that it shows the Vietnamese soldiers as young, frightened men who are just as scared as the American troops. I also liked how the Vietnamese commander was also worried about his men and morned their death, when most war movie show the enemy as soleless monsters who are out to get America (i know people know that is not how they really are, or at least I hope I do). So watch this film for it great performances, Sam Elliot gave outstanding support which is worthy of an Oscar too, it's incredible realism (which is almost too hard to watch at parts), and it's powerful scenes of men fighting and being killed for each other. 10/10"
"jhclues","9","1","2","12 March 2002"," A Sobering Meditation On War
","The title of the memoir that inspired this film, `We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,' written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  `We Were Soldiers,' adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.<br/><br/>	It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.    The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things: That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.  <br/><br/>	With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, `Pearl Harbor' and `Black Hawk Down'-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, `Pearl Harbor' is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas `Black Hawk Down' put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it. <br/><br/>
	The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the `whole story,' that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.<br/><br/>	Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.<br/><br/>	Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed `Too Tall' Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like `We Were Soldiers,' is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.  9/10."

WWS is just another example of how we are sentimental about our pasts. In being so sentimental we are also willing to forget certain details about events that may be a little too painful.

","How to make a good war movie? It's easy: get the facts right and and get the battle scenes right. This movie fails with the facts and then some.<br/><br/>The battle scenes look great with some obvious Vietnam stuff like napalm and period details like white phosphorus and so on. Though, a very unrealistic clich√© is that the higher ranked the character, the more upright he walks and fights even under heavy fire.<br/><br/>The dialogue contains some hilarious gems that I think are only now put in a script. Before that, they existed only as clich√©s. Imagine hearing ""tell my wife I love her"" from the mouth of a dying soldier, just after you thought this movie could be more clich√© only if they did that.<br/><br/>I guess by now it is well-known this movie doesn't really make the facts right. The battle is something off Green Beret. While it's probably quite banal having a Vietnam movie in which US doesn't exactly prevail by now, it's another thing to claim the opposite. You can still have your altruism and the other few good aspects of the human nature in a war even if you don't win.<br/><br/>I find it surprising people approve of movies like this out of the respect they have war veterans (of their own side). It's one thing to respect and to let movies like this change the facts - and in this case, just not be that good at all. I'd think that would be insulting to the veterans."
"isbabo","2","2","8","31 July 2005"," now we're glorifying Vietnam?
","This movie just plain sickens me. It shows the Americans at their absolute worst. It's hard to even know where to begin.<br/><br/>For starters, it has every clich√© in the book. The one soldier who has a pregnant wife at home, the black soldier who can't do his laundry in a white only laundromat but who will still fight for his country, the one soldier who spent a year in Africa with his wife building orphanages because ""he wanted to help orphans, not create them"" (so naturally he joined the army). Then to the battlefield where one soldier actually says before he dies ""I'm glad I died for my country"". Gibson bravely says ""no man will be left behind"" and sure enough, all are saved by the glorious teamwork and bravery of the American soldiers (after all, the U.S won in Vietnam right?.... read VERY sarcastically). The constant prayer gets annoying too, we all know Mel is a born again, and that''s fine, but it really doesn't have to be in every scene of every film he makes. In fact, at one point he's praying (for about the 8th time) and he asks god not to listen to the enemies ""heathen prayer"". <br/><br/>This isn't an anti-American rant, if Britain made a film glorifying the occupation of India or Germany the invasion of Poland I'd feel the same way. This film is little more then a recruiting poster for Iraq II. The only thing that gives it a 2 is the fact that they show the North Vietnamese commander in a human light, he does care for his men and wants to win. He also says at the end that now they'll have to fight the Americans, but that the outcome will be the same as it was for the French. <br/><br/>I don't want to knock the men who did fight in Vietnam (whether American, French, Vietnamese, South Korean, Australian etc.) but this is unnecessary. Go rent Platoon. Randal Wallace says in the commentary that this film is ""getting Vietnam right"" while making his sole source a Lt. Col who is portrayed in a very flattering light in the film. Platoon was researched asking privates and corporals in the U.S army what it was like. Better film and more accurate, rent it instead."

It's truly amazing.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm not a supporter of the US involvement in Vietnam, as it was totally uncalled for. And secondly, American soldiers have never been and will never be, the best soldiers in the world. Maybe one of the absolutely best equipped soldiery of the world, but again - not the best when it comes to fighting. And definitely not within the jungle landscape of the Vietcong homeland. And that's what annoys me so much about this film. Compare this disgrace of a movie with for example Full Metal Jacket by Kubrick, and you get a comparison like that of stale old moldy bread with a box of delicious chocolate.<br/><br/>Hundreds of times in this film, you see the native forces of Vietnam getting bested by their american counterparts.

It is as likely as if the Vietnamese would invade South Carolina and suddenly be the experts on everything essential in the area. The ONLY reason the US ever got the upper hand historically, in my opinion, is that they had superior aerial forces and could bombard strategic locations with things like napalm and agent orange.<br/><br/>And the so called ""acting"" in this movie suck so much that it generates a backdraft. 'Stoneface Gibson' is more concerned these days that his looks and personal aura gets thru, than actually doing any real acting and is a real bore to watch. This personal cult-building around his persona began in the end of Braveheart and have just gotten worse by every movie since.<br/><br/>Just don't watch this dung, especially if you rate films like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan high on your personal list.<br/><br/>Dracopticon out."

The script is boring and unimaginitive, as are all of the characters in the movie.  None of the characters are either interesting or likeable enough to care about, and I didn't mind when any of them died.  There was very little good character development, even though the first part of the movie (before the actual battle) seemed to drag on endlessly.  The presence of Mel Gibson further ruined the movie, although I think it was unsalvagable anyway.  How can I get caught up in the character of Colonel Moore when Mel Gibson plays himself in every movie? (The Julia Roberts phenomenon). The final bad thing was the music- it was by turns obnoxious motivational shmaltz and some bizarre Irish song played at least three times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie about soldiers in Vietnam, see ""Platoon."" It is far and away the best Vietnam movie. If you are looking for a movie depicting the utter horror of Vietnam, rent ""Apocalypse Now"" or "" The Deer Hunter.""

Then we plunge into a fierce battle of unprepared Americans for the remainder of the movie. Very graphic, I might add. So it does add a lot of the realism to WAR ‚Äì or ""conflict.""

Instead of valiantly charging the enemy with bayonets fixed, while accompanied by a Huey gunship- which Snake Sh*t mysteriously flies in only one scene, Col. Moore's unit simply withdrew from the field as the other units relieved them. Watching the closing scenes, I thought maybe it was a dream of Col.

","It's not easy bringing a realistic war to the big screen. One must manage to weave a story around the severed limbs and crushed skulls of combat, a tall order that only a few films have brilliantly accomplished.<br/><br/>WE WERE SOLDIERS accomplishes it, too, but not as well as predecessors like BLACK HAWK DOWN and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Director Randall Wallace gets full marks for realism (you'll cringe at the charred flesh and gushing extremities), but it all feels like a distraction from the story rather than an integral part of it. And although all ""real war"" films are out of necessity chaotic and confusing, Wallace doesn't give the audience enough chances to catch its breath.<br/><br/>Like RYAN and BLACK HAWK, the biggest virtue of WE WERE SOLDIERS is its human side. The scenes with Madeleine Stowe and her friend touring the neighborhood back home to deliver death notices are touching and sobering. Mel Gibson's character, a lieutenant colonel of strong faith called on to participate in something so awful, is deep and intriguing. The bond between Gibson's comes across as sincere and pure.<br/><br/>In fact, it's probably fair to say WE WERE SOLDIERS is strongest off the battlefield.

","Just because it is true story it doesn't have to be great.I realize Hollywood, now more than ever, wants to do its patriotic duty and pay respects to those who lost their lives for the Americans. Or do they? When a movie has nothing interesting to say about war, does it really serve a purpose? Does it really have to reflect what happened then in a schmaltzy patriotic way? I realize that in the first 45 minutes of the movie there was no action at all. It was just like getting prepared for a mawkish drama but we should keep in our mind that you can't create a war drama without action this is not a movie on a case like abortion or rape and a war movie is supposed to be something that affects the life of a community not a an individual. You can't just reflect the zeitgeist of war-torn families by showing taxi drivers who deliver telegrams from the soldiers out there? You can't just tell about war by using corny lines! You can't just look at a war in one-sided Americanism? To reflect a war by imagining the soul of two sides you are not supposed to reflect the lines of the Viatnemese commander in a second in the end and then saying the photographer son you gotta do it you gotta tell what these soldiers did for their country? What about the Viatnemese soldiers and what they did for their own country in their own lands? If ""We Were Soldiers"" was the first war movie ever made, it would be a great one. All those men from different walks of life, thrown together in an inhuman war, while their wives wait for them back home -- such drama and pathos! But think about when ""Full Metal Jacket"" was produced? It is highly time to throw Vietnam aside and think of something else more original than that! Well let's say ""We Were Soldiers"" is just too Corny emotional schmaltzy ""Black Hawk Down"" with a more heart that's all! If you just wanna see it by renting a DVD don't really bother.

Although it starts with the new training at Fort Benning, the viewer gets to know both sides involved in this conflict. And soon we see that these men were not only soldiers trained to kill, but fathers, husbands and human beings. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson does a good job and characterizes Hal Moore as a brave and sensitive person.

And so's - in slo-mo - the guy carrying his wounded friend, right? Check. The cut aways to the women at home getting the news? The leader's ""it should have been me"" speech? The dying soldier whispering, ""Tell my daddy I love him""? The enemy leader, after the battle, predicting the course of the rest of the war? Check, check, check, check. The soldier dying by throwing himself on a grenade? Oh, no, wait. NOBODY could call that one up. It's too much. There are CAVE PAINTINGS with that cliche. It's too... my God, they did that, too.<br/><br/>The biggest shame of ""We Were Soldiers"" is its waste of great performances. Mel Gibson doesn't turn in a career-best performance, but this is in his upper third. Greg Kinnear is almost unrecognizable in a complete departure from his earlier work. Sam Elliott and Barry Pepper are... well, Sam Elliott and Barry Pepper. It's just.... Man. When Pepper gives the ""I came here to make the people in America understand"" speech, Pepper's giving it his all, but I roll my eyes hard enough to sprain an optic muscle or two.<br/><br/>What's lacking is talent behind the camera. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is just as cliched, but Spielberg uses those cliches better than anyone before - one might hope, to end the need ever to repeat them. Writer-director Randall Wallace (who also wrote ""Pearl Harbor"" - and if that's not a giant candy-apple red warning flag, I don't know what is) doesn't seem to think so. And his delivery is painful. There are moments - like Pepper's photographic montage, or the scene at the end with the press corps that doesn't ""get it,"" that are so cheesy as to almost become parody. The movie a comedy troupe might make if they wanted to send up horrible war movies. And it WOULD be funny, if it weren't so realistic. Just as World War II veterans spoke of ""Pearl Harbor""'s realism, some Vietnam veterans have talked about the realism of this film's action. But the realism and the performances make the whole mess WORSE. They add earnestness to the tripe, and nothing's worse than humorless camp.<br/><br/>Somewhere between the brooding navel-gazing of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" (both of which I loved, although I'd never consider them ""realistic"" portrayals of Vietnam or any war) and the jingoistic propaganda of ""The Green Berets"" and ""Rambo,"" (the latter of which I liked), there's a Vietnam movie to be made that shows soldiers of both sides as humans in an inhuman situation.

Why did he not think about Di√™n Bi√™n Phu where the French lost 10.000 men and the Vietnamese 25.000 soldiers in 1954, eleven years before?  While the Americans at that time had no intention entering Vietnam. There was a Catholic government in South-Vietnam and as long as the military did not intervene in South-Vietnamese affairs, the Americans had no reason to enter the country. The battle-scenes are realistic and are interrupted by showing the families of the military at home who receive the mail of the soldiers or the announcement of their death. It is shown with a sentimental reserve which is a good balance to the horror of this battle.  The Americans kept thinking that the Vietnamese would continue their kamikaze-attacks but soon after they changed tactics and tried to hide for the American marines until the American bombers spit them out.  It is strange that the Americans started this war after their experiences in Corea and the lessons they could draw from the French.  Why do people always start so voluntarily a war?"

The weaknesses are many unfortunately. The most glaring is the script. The movie seems torn between trying to offer a poetic view of war as a hindsight (like ""THE THIN RED LINE"") or the bravado of courage under fire (any John Wayne war movie). I don't think think that many of the lines used in the movie would actually be heard on a battlefield. A few times I had to hide my eyes from the other viewers lest they see that mine were rolling. The movie appeared to be something that it was not. It was not ""PLATOON"" with its haunting score and personal narration. It was not ""THIN RED LINE"" with its surreal view of conflict. It was not ""FULL METAL JACKET"" with an intensity that is maintained throughout its duration. It tried to be all or any of these three without succeeding.

","I feel ashamed that I was suckered into seeing this garbage.  I am not one of those people that dismisses war movies, but this film is just an insult to our collective intelligence.  In my opinion, there are two types of war movies, ones that tell stories and ones that exist for the action.  Both can be quite good, as anyone that has seen Black Hawk Down can attest.  Where this movies fails is in its attempt to do both at once.  What results is a film that has a horrible plot and just plain boring violence.  So what if some soldiers die, all I was doing was looking at my watch. <br/><br/>
I must confess I have not read the book and know little about Vietnam or war in general.  What I do recognize however are unconvincing action sequences filtered so that no one storms out of the theatre.  If there was even the slightest attempt to do research into the weaponry and tactics in the actual battle, I would not have been so badly disapointed.  As it is, all I see are a bunch of actors pretending to react to special effects.  Also,  for a movie that places so much emphasis on the ""brotherhood"" of soldiers,  there is remarkably little concern shown to racial stereotypes in its plot.  The vietnamese are little more than cannon fodder in this film, and there isn't even an attempt made to show the trappings of real people.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would like for people to really think the next time they see a war movie:  is this American flag here really saying something, or is it just a colorful piece of scenery used to prop up the semblance of a story?

","I'd like to comment briefly on this film, in reply to a comment made by Cory Branton-Speak. I would be very surprised if this film gives a realistic picture of the events in Vietnam between '65 and '75. Sure, it has gory battle scenes and as you pointed out, ""real last words"", but the film gave me a very artificial impression, more than once. Notice how, in every single battle scene, the Americans seem to act rather intelligently, running towards covered areas, ducking, lying down and focus firing (as they should be). The Vietcong, however, show far less rational behaviour. They get up and run into the American's reinforcements or camps, all by themselves, with no covering fire, even when five of their buddies have already done the same thing two minutes earlier. These crash-test dummies are used as background entertainment, while the camera focuses yet again on an enormously interesting conversation of a few Americans. In reality, however, the American troops did not even SEE the Vietcong as often as they seem to in this movie. In the major battles, they often won, but they simply didn't know the territory and the enemy as good as they should have. Add to that the one-year tour of duty that was being employed, and you might get a grasp of the figures: 58,000 casualties. The Americans were losing men and the enemy was invisible. I bid you, think about those things. Mel Gibson has - again - failed miserably as a director. This is NOT a realistic war movie. Period."

Nevermind that US involvement in the Vietnam war was essentially one big war crime (the US wanted to stop elections, not ""bring about a free Vietnam"" as this film states), no, we have myths to uphold! No surprise then that Mel Gibson's the film's central star; his ""Passion of the Christ"" is ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" in Sunday School garb: ""Earn This"" fascism for the bullet porn generation.<br/><br/>Incidentally, several recent studies show that those convicted of violent crimes have higher levels of testosterone; their testosterone levels resemble that of young males entering or going through puberty. The attraction of war is a juvenile thing, and so its no surprise that films, regardless of genre, which revel in violence tend to appeal to younger or male audiences. But not too young. As computer games and game consoles increasingly take war off the cinema screens and onto the screens of interactive media (kids can now band together online and fight battles by proxy), today's kids are likely to find ""We Were Soldier's"" positively archaic.<br/><br/>6/10 ‚Äì Worth one viewing."

I know that this scene was not meant too be funny, but most of us laughed because the pathos just didn't work. To me, the whole letter of death scheme reminded me of Oscar Wilde's comedies where letters of embarrassing content are handed over to all kinds of people. The second scene which I thought was revolting, was when Gibson's character shoots a Vietcong and laconically says something like 'It's getting a little sporty over here' to some general or other on the radio. The scenes about the Vietcong enemy weren't convincing at all, the conclusions that were to be drawn from them was something like: Yeah the Vietcong are humans as well, but they are not as handsome and smart as Mel Gibson so it's okay for him to shoot them and make snide remarks about their demise. If the Gibson character had really been a hero he wouldn't have gone to war at all.

This movie is utter crap!!!<br/><br/>It is the most overdone piece of rubbish about the vietnam war, or any war for that matter, i have ever seen. It focuses on heroism like black hawk down yet someow fails to do so in a positive way, by having the blatant glorification very overdone.<br/><br/>It lacks realism to the point were it seems like a science fiction movie.<br/><br/>The combat was so terribly staged, completely lacking in realism. There is a part where a vietcong soldier somehow appears out of nowhere and bayonet charges at Colonel Hal Moore, the leader of the operation and get to within a meter of him where the Colonel(?),played by Mel Gibson ,spins around in time to shoot him in head. As you can may be able to gather events like this are all too common in this absolute disgrace of a  film. Furthmore although the emphasis of this movie is placed on heroism, glory and sacrifice the film fails to capture any believable emotion unlike war flicks like the Thin Red Line(excellent film, must see)<br/><br/>Watch Rambo instead as both Rambo and We Were Soldiers are of the same substance but at least Rambo does not attempt to be something it isnt."
"Pingo-2","2","1","4","23 March 2003"," Extremely bad movie!
","This is probably Mel Gibson's worst movie ever. Randall Wallace, who also wrote PEARL HARBOR, among other movies, don't seem to understand that the most important thing in a film is the characters. In this film we don't meet any characters at all, just a bunch of nameless soldiers that gets killed.<br/><br/>We do meet one person with a name. That is Mel Gibson's character, Moore. But do we feel anything for him, or understand his actions? No, because Moore is a very boring and predictable person.<br/><br/>The violence is sometimes very graphic. This is the fact in other movies too, like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and PEARL HARBOR, but in those movies the graphic and extreme violence has a point. It doesn't in this film.<br/><br/>
The movie WE WERE SOLDIERS is dull, boring and pointless. Not only is Randall Wallace a bad writer, he is even worse when it comes to directing. The music score don't help this, since it is totally dysfunctional and totally wrong. The music is good, but not for this movie. It feels like they took a score from some other movie and just stuck it in here.<br/><br/>So, what is my rating for this disaster? I put a 2 out of 10, because the film has nice cinematography, but that's all. The rest of this movie is totally boring and bad. Even HAMBURGER HILL is better than this awful movie. I certainly hope that Randall Wallace learns how to write, because he just can't pull a good script together."

","An unfathomably bad movie. Endless successions of comic book realism (Mel needs no cover, now bow before him), cliches, distortions of the truth and historical revisionism (lies), poor or otherwise absent acting, and a shameful dose of American triumphalism. That's right! Not even a hint of apologism in the invasion of Vietnam. Not to mention to expected incompetence of 4000 well-trained NVAs in their own territory vs. the 395 ra-ra-ra U.S. soldiers. History re-written and the quality of each armed forces authentic qualities go down the drain with Gibsonite technolywood propaganda which appears to have come out straight out of the mouth of the U.S. Department of Defence 30 years ago (that's right, 30 years ago). The proaganda; the disjointedness of the story; the Mel Gibson overacting & his new identity as more-patriotic-than-GWB (and he's Australian, is he not); the dialogue lines -- 'Glad to die for my country' , I almost threw up. Glad to be involved & to die for in a meaningless war that would kill 2 million Vietnamese - but wait, Vietnamese lives are worth 1/1000000000 of an American one so it's okay. Anyway they shouldn't have been committing terrorist acts on U.S. soil and trying to invade... Just wait Holywood will rewrite the Indochina conflict in this manner in 10 years. Such a surprise though, that the Vietnameese, led by THEIR George Washington, Ho Chi Minh, were not prepared to be ruled by French colonialism, why would they want to live under an American one, they were fighting for their independence.<br/><br/>Alas for the three-sentence history lesson, those who like this movie, those who made this movie, clearly do not have the slightest care about history, just triumphalism and money. The glroious 395 Americans virtually annhilate the 4000 NVAs in cqc, again, was unfathomably painful to watch as it was reminiscent of so many, so - so many similar Holywood Vietnam propaganda movie - there are no shortage of these. The true gems: Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Hamburger Hill, etc., tend to be less submissive to the Holywood revisionisms.

"MovieAddict2016","Null","1","4","22 August 2002"," A good war film--but lacking some of what BRAVEHEART and THE PATRIOT had...
","What WE WERE SOLDIERS lacked in short, was some of the raw emotional drive on Mel Gibson's part. For example-in THE PATRIOT his son dies, so he seeks revenge on the soldier who killed him, and in BRAVEHEART his wife dies. This is the ""Righteous anger"" that Mel Gibson usually uses on screen in these films, and while I understand WE WERE SOLDIERS is very true to the facts, I think Mel could've done some more emotional driven scenes-HOWEVER... I still really liked the film. There were a few parts that dragged out, but overall WE WERE SOLDIERS is an excellent achievment. For those who say too much violence is in this- I personally think it's important to have violence in truth based war films. Pearl Harbor was a disgrace aiming for a PG-13 rating. WE WERE SOLDIERS honors those dead soldiers who died in battle, by using realistic violence, and I personally think it payed off in the end.<br/><br/>
 Sometimes by the sets they used in the film you could tell were just being flashed with light for explosion effects at night, but this did not matter to me. I thought this film was excellent and I give it 3.5/5 stars-not as good as Braveheart or the Patriot, but still an excellent war movie-possibly Mel's most graphic too.<br/><br/>JOHN ULMER"
"Spleen","4","1","4","15 August 2002"," If you're watching this movie with someone, and his or her eyes start to mist over, edge away slowly
","This is a Coca-Cola ad of a film.  It's about nothing, it affirms nothing, it denies nothing, it scarcely even hints at anything; the pointlessness of all the footage, considered as a whole, is as mystifying as the footage of a skydiver jumping out of a plane on a surfboard and then drinking Coca-Cola when he lands.  Yet one is somehow left with the distinct impression that an attempt has been made to persuade one of something.  Meaningless Coca-Cola ads are obviously - don't ask me what makes them so, or why it's obvious - ""for"" rather than against Coca-Cola; this apparently pointless film is clearly ""for"" rather than against the American armed forces.  Perhaps it's the air of leaden reverence.  Perhaps it's the rat-a-tat-a-tat drums.  Don't ask me what it is, and don't try to deny it, either.<br/><br/>Here's what happens.  It's 1965.  The American forces land, are pointed towards a segment of the Vietnamese army and ordered to destroy it - i.e., kill as many of the people in it as possible.  The Vietnamese army seems (we're never told in detail) to have exactly the opposite goal: to avoid being killed, and to kill as many of the invaders as possible.  That's it. That's ALL the context we're given.  It's like watching the world's largest game of Skirmish, but without any rules.  To be sure, soldiers on both sides appear to be meeting with some success: a great many people die; the Vietnamese whose country is being invaded, cleanly and off-screen and with a minimum of fuss; the US soldiers, in all manner of creatively gory ways (the makeup and special effects artists seem to have had the time of their lives, finding new ways to show people dying).  By the end of the battle we've seen so much War Movie Stuff - trite platitudes, bone-headed ""inspirational"" speeches, gore, bullets, bombs, mawkish death scenes, Goddammits - that we could easily fail to notice that we're never told what happened overall, let alone why.<br/><br/>Before and after and in between all this senseless battle we see women on the home front; in one memorably bad scene, everyone sits around in a big circle looking uncomfortable, as though nobody can remember which actress is supposed to be playing which character, and acutely aware that it doesn't matter.  These women have little to do with the rest of the movie.  They're there as if because of ""equal time"" legislation.  The same could be said of the cut-aways to the Vietnamese (who ought, by rights, to have been the centre-stage heroes), whom Wallace trots before the camera as though discharging a poorly understood duty that he'd like to get out of the way quickly.<br/><br/>The ostensible hero, Colonel Moore, comes across as a grade-A prat; never in his entire screen career has Mel Gibson been so devoid of charm or discernible intelligence.  Perhaps his most buffoonish hour comes when he delivers the inspirational speech to the poor soldiers who are about to head off to a bloodbath on the other side of the world, where they'll kill and be killed in the service of... Well, he can't say what it's in the service of, so he says something unrelated which he imagines is stirring: ""Some of you will die.  I can't promise you that you'll make it back alive.  But I can promise this: I will leave no-one behind.  Dead or alive, we will all come back.""  This doesn't happen, of course, which is just as well.  (Imagine if Moore REALLY had to retrieve all the dead bodies, including those which fell into enemy-controlled ravines and those which nobody could locate.)  But the insult lies in offering this as something a condemned man would want to hear.  Surely some of the soldiers were standing there thinking: If I get killed in battle, BIG DEAL if my corpse has a seat reserved on the flight back."

The last was mention for how many times, but with an effort to break the cliche' one of this line is uttered by a Japanese American trooper, brilliant right? i can only stupidly assume that this is a redemptional act of Randall Wallace,who probably feels guilty since he dehumanizes the Nipponese so much in Pearl Habour(2001) and, since he is taking Karate lessons(no..seriously!), he decided to come up with the idea, and what brilliant idea; an Asian, the supposedly central race of the enemy, also exist in the Troopers,hath become the tear jerking navigator of the third act.<br/><br/>Also,since the producers are busy spending their money on 25 million a-piece-Mel-Gibson and buying C4 to destroy every green area that appears on the screen, they can't be bothered to show authenticity of location, therefore they decided to use some embarrasingly fake location(I'm guessing its still inside North America) and plant some plastic mini palm trees, wow.. this, i have to say, is pathetic.

Truth is indeed scary, i only hope, if theres another ""Anti-war"" flicks let it be ones which goes more along the line of Thin Red Line(1998), where affection and depth are showed from two opposing sides, and the study of inner humanity is richly embraced, not artificially sugar coated.<br/><br/>ps: Windtalkers is just out on the cinema, after this chunk i doubt it that i want to see Nick Cage wielding two tommy guns, one on each hand, sliding in the air for 5 seconds while sending 99 running Japanese troops to the bowels of Hades, it has become an essential unwritten rule in hollywood films that all historical war villain troops have to run towards the good guys, holding firearms but by any means not using 'em, since screaming in villainish rage is life threatening enough.<br/><br/>1.5 outta 5 stars.<br/><br/>+1.5 for entertainment factor that glorifies the fact that war is not so horrible if shoulder to shoulder male bonding occurs..(sarcasm intended).<br/><br/>-3.5 for all the factors in the film that forced me to write this review which ends up more like a personal contrived opinion."

Now before I get abused as a 'No Good Limey'....IF you want to make a 'Documentary' style movie....Stick to the Facts....BUT what is most distasteful bit is: The Main character in this film is in fact a Brit who in wanting to do his bit in Vietnam, became a US citizen & joined the Army. Now for the important bit.....After leaving the Forces, he became head of security for I think it was Walberg's in the Twin Towers. During his time there he wrote a document about the fact that the most probable Danger to the Staff was from an air attack. On that fateful day he not only got every single member of the company out alive, he also went back in to safe more Lives & then Died a TRUE Hero. So I find it sad that since this film was made post 9/11 that Mr. Gibson did not feel it important to make this FACT known.

","If you have watched a lot of war movies, you'll know America has pumped out more than any nation, hence you've already had a taste of U.S. war propaganda: ie. a classic example is seen in this movie where every U.S. soldier who sticks their head up an inch is shot, EXCEPT for the commander who can strut around upright or stand stock still without even a wound. This represents American bravery, more accurately 'guts' or 'balls'. Another classic example goes as far back as the old Westerns, but it is such a well-loved clich√© they use it ad infinitum - it is the scene where the enemy hurl themselves headlong into a slaughter while the Yanks hunker down and mow them down like wheat before a rainstorm. Yes, I know sometimes you have to rush a position but usually you'll soften it up first with grenades or mortars. The VC in this movie have about 5 grenades and no mortars, apparently. I like how the 1st platoon is pinned down with like 5 guys left and the VC just keep rushing in again and again - NOT throwing in a single grenade which would have finished it right there.

","There's no shortage of Vietnam war films out there and, of the ones I've seen, 'We Were Soldiers' has to be one of the weaker ones. While this film has everything we've come to expect from the high-budget war genre in that it's well-made, well-acted and looks great, it does nothing to stand out from the crowd and is relatively weak in terms of plot and originality.<br/><br/>Despite what should have been an engaging and moving storyline, the pedestrian pacing and over-the-top dialogue and violence makes it difficult to fully invest in what's happening.<br/><br/>'We Were Soldiers' is a solid, watchable film, but it is surprisingly forgettable and difficult to connect with compared to other similar war films."
"tkohaut-1","1","0","4","6 September 2019"," Pathos and patriotism in annoying doses
","Based on the IMDb rating, I just decided to give this movie a shot, already expecting to see some degree of pathos, cliche and patriotism to be included, but I didn't expect it to be in such unbearable doses. The first part of the movie is basically a blue-print of how not to do character development, as it basically is one long boring drag to show, that each and every American soldier is one good guy, who loves god, his wife, kids, country and most of all his platoon. Same as for all other messages, that the movie wants to get through later on, each and every single scene seems to scream, why deliver this message in a subtle way, if You can basically nail it with a sledgehammer into the forehead of even the most simple minded person. So if this message by end of part one of the movie through all those scenes of soldiers cuddling with their individual family members and bonding with their platoon mates has not gotten through yet, Mel Gibson's pep talk to his fellow soldiers before going to war should have ultimately made sure of it.<br/><br/>So I was hoping for the movie to get better in part 2, but it just didn't . It just went further downhill. Every scene following the start of the actual fight reeks of one of the following messages, which are mercilessly unsubtle carved into the audience's forehead:<br/><br/>1.) We want to be a little different than other war movies, by giving the enemy a glimpse of human character. So let's give them a few seconds to look at the same moon as the American soldiers and one of them, although he doesn't have a line to say, can even have a picture of a girlfriend, but that is as good as it gets, because ultimately the enemy is not much more than ...<br/><br/>2.) ...cannonfodder , who doesn't seem to have many ideas, what to actually do with their guns, as in one scene after the other, they continue to either run or sneak towards the American soldiers, either not shooting or in the rare cases, when they do, failing to hit anything, resulting in most cases, that they look like trying to merely overrun the enemy and essentially even failing to finish off an outnumbered, cut off platoon without ammo, while....<br/><br/>3.) ... at the same time the American Heroes are essentially impenetrable to bullets, culminating in the laughable scene, where Mel Gibson is standing in the middle of an open field, that is supposed to be overrun by the enemy, with bullets flying all around, just aiming to look manly and thoughtful at the same time for a minute or so....<br/><br/>4.) ...while the comparably few gruesome deaths of American soldiers almost exclusively serve the purpose of reminding the audience of what was said in part 1, by giving them dramatic lines - tell XYZ I love him/her, I am so proud to die for my country etc. !!! - or having them gloriously killed, while trying to carry another wounded/killed comrade.<br/><br/>And if this last message still has not been understood by each and everyone by the time, when the battle is won, Mel Gibson's last talk with Barry Pepper - I will never forgive myself, that I have lived and my boys have not or something of that kind - surely does the trick in its usual subtle manner.<br/><br/>There are a lot of movies out there with less production value than this one, but this movie for me is so annoying in its simplistic and lopsided messages and even worse the way it delivers them by treating the audience like simpletons who need to be spoon fed those messages, that this warrants nothing more than one star."

"Leofwine_draca","10","0","1","3 December 2016"," Vietnam war epic is one of the best of its type
","A solid and highly impressive war movie, one of the latest to follow in the wake of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and one which is no less moving and powerful. This time around the setting is Vietnam at the beginning of the war in 1965, but the setting and the enemy is not really important. Instead this film focuses on the humanity of the American soldiers involved and the way they must band together in order to survive, employing the now clich√©d ""leave no man behind"" type morale to lead them through it. The film is utterly entertaining due to the tons of action and fighting that it offers and only now, with the modern advent of digital effects, can cinema deliver incredible scenes of action and violence in a realistic manner (check out the napalm bombing, where CGI planes fly past overheard and they look just like the real thing).<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is a good choice as the lead, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, and even if the film hadn't been as good it still could have been carried by Gibson alone, who adopts the persona as his own and puts in an assured, likable, human but tough performance. Gibson's becoming a real pro at portraying military leaders these days and his performance here is no exception, one of the finest I've seen from the man. Similarly there are also some great supporting roles from Greg Kinnear (underused as a helicopter pilot sickened by the death toll) and Sam Elliott as a tough but worthy sergeant. Also worth watching for is Barry Pepper as an American reporter, forced to take up arms and fight for his life when the battle closes in around him.<br/><br/>The film is strong on sentimentality and very moving in parts, especially the scenes where the wives back home decide to deliver the death letters themselves. Although sentimental it never gets overdone or mawkish like in a Spielberg movie, never uncomfortable. The action sequences are excellent and the movie has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. In the documentary on the DVD it says that over ten thousand bullet shots are heard in the movie and they come at you constantly from all directions, really putting you into the middle of the battle like BLACK HAWK DOWN did.<br/><br/>The film is also pretty gory with one or two scenes of ultra-horror, such as the Chinese soldier who gets his body destroyed with napalm but still carries on surviving. Special effects, both computer and makeup, are outstanding and the music is more than appropriate, especially a Scottish ballad that they play which is pretty moving. I also liked the fact that we saw from the point of view of the Vietcong, albeit briefly; this humanises an enemy so often portrayed as simply demonic and evil and gives the film an extra level. WE WERE SOLDIERS is a prime-time piece of entertainment and one of the best films of the year."
"LJTweed","4","0","2","22 November 2015"," A right wing circle j***
","First of all, there is no denying that this is an important story that should be told. The first conflict in the Vietnam debacle is modern history at its most intense. That being said...<br/><br/>The movie is a menagerie of complete awful. It fails on every level of filmmaking. The dialogue is farmed from the worst of John Wayne's WWII clich√©s. (Every word from Sam Elliot's mouth.) The directing is the worst example of film student pushiness. (The Barry Pepper photo montage.) The acting is so over the top that Al Pacino would be jealous. (Mel Gibson hamming it up in the role of Lt. Col. Hal Moore.) Even the FX are just amateur versions of Michael Bay movies. <br/><br/>However, Greg Kinnear shines as Maj. Bruce 'Snake' Crandall, the helicopter pilot in charge of coordinating flights in and out of the ""hot zone"". His hubris and humanity make up for more than a few of the more exploitative and under-developed characters. <br/><br/>There is more good and bad here. Needless flashbacks to home life. A bizarre tour inside the mind of the VC's Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An. Tantalizing moments of sheer horror in the midst of war. Hero stories.<br/><br/>In the end, I wanted this movie to be good. I wanted this important story to be told well but due to the incompetent directing and writing of Randall Wallace I was left feeling unsatisfied and cheated. If you want to see a remake of anything, it should probably be this movie."

My question is: how could it be so easy for American troops to kill VCs in the film? If it really were like the way the movie depicted, the US would haven't needed Search&Destroy operations for years. I still remember in the series ""Vietnam in HD"", real American vets usually said ""NVA troops are smart as hell"" and I don't think they would agree with this film.

"sddavis63","8","0","1","24 November 2011"," The Human Side Of This Is What Makes It Work So Well
","The depiction this film offers of the Battle of La Drang (the first major battle fought by the United States in Vietnam) is brilliant. It's so well re-enacted and so graphic that it truly does give the viewer a taste (but only a taste) of the insanity and sheer violence of war. It's a taste. I was comfortably sitting in my living room watching this. I don't claim to have been able to fully (or even remotely) understand what the soldiers in the midst of the battle were feeling. But it is a taste. Well done, and very sobering. It has to be one of the best battle re-enactments I've ever seen in a movie. As well done as it was, though, it wasn't the depiction of the battle that made this work. One gets desensitized after a while. The sheer scale of the carnage being depicted is overwhelming and from time to time my mind just left the screen as if I needed a break from it. So if this had been all about the battle it wouldn't have been nearly as effective as it was. What made this work was the very effective interweaving of so many very human elements to the story above and beyond just the depiction of the battle. These were, indeed, soldiers, but they were more than soldiers. They were real people, with wives and children and friends back home. Real people with lives that went far beyond what they did on the battlefield. Real people that we cared about because we learned of their lives and of how much reason they had to live and of how tragic it was that so many of them died.<br/><br/>The human elements of the story were shown in many ways. Although sometimes long introductions to a story bother me, I appreciated the somewhat lengthy introduction to this movie. After a brief look at the French experience in Vietnam, the movie shifts to a U.S. Army base where a new division is being put together to go to Vietnam and engage the enemy. We see the unit being formed. We meet the men - more importantly, we meet their families. It was a great way of drawing us into their stories; of reminding us that these were real life flesh and blood men, and not just destined to be battlefield casualty statistics. Later, after deployment and as the battle heats up, we're drawn into the anguish of the families as telegrams are delivered, telling wives that their husbands had been killed - telegrams originally delivered by taxi cab drivers because the Army wasn't ready with chaplains, until the wife of the commanding officer takes over the job of going door to door to break the news. I was impressed by the depiction of the North Vietnamese. They weren't depicted as evil; they weren't caricatured. They were the enemy - but only because this was war. They were soldiers, too - with people who loved them; a point brilliantly made by the use of one Vietnamese soldiers' notebook (eventually picked up by the Americans) that contained a picture of his sweetheart. And, in the end, the movie is clearly shown to be not about war, but about the relationship between the men, as we see Col. Moore's anguish at the loss of so many soldiers and his relief at returning home, and as the point is made that these men didn't fight so much for their country - they fought more for each other.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson I thought pulled off the role of Col. Moore quite well: fiercely devoted to his men, and as commander of the 7th Cavalry determined to avoid the fate that had befallen the commander and troops of a previous 7th Cavalry - Custer at the Little Big Horn. That was an interesting connection that was made several times in the movie. This is a very good war movie, made even better by the fact that it's about more than war - it's about the people who fought and lived and died together, and about the people back home who loved them.

"dugan49","8","0","2","20 September 2011"," In the Upper Level Of Modern War Movies
","Not as good as Saving Private Ryan or Blackhawk Down, but better than most other war movies of the past 25 years, We Were Soldiers is a no nonsense retelling of the first large scale engagement in Viet Nam between American troops and North Vietnamese regulars, in 1965. Mel Gibson stars as Colonel Hal Moore, who leads the famed U.S. 7th Cavalry , now air mobile, into a 'test' battle in the central highlands of Nam to judge the effectiveness of new combat tactics derived through use of helicopter transport of troops directly into a hostile ( hot lz) landing zone. <br/><br/>Immediately upon landing, Moore's battalion is attacked by hundreds of NVA, regular soldiers of North Viet Nam who are based in the nearby hills. The attacking force soon balloons to thousands, and the Americans are outnumbered and surrounded. The movie then very diligently and dutifully portrays the hectic and brutal three day battle.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is it's point of view, which shows the regard a commander has for his troops and his dedication to his duty and mission. Gibson is outstanding in portraying a decent yet disciplined leader who must maintain control and cohesion in the midst of chaos and incredible violence. Sam Elliot also stands out as the unit's Sergeant major, an old timer made of guts and granite.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie and the violence , while overwhelming at times, is not as well done as in the two films I mentioned at the top. Still it has it's moments. A lot of them as a matter of fact. The main pleasure I took from this film was in watching military men of honor do their thing on a field of battle while I was sitting in a comfortable chair in a safe place."

The entire film reminded me of the Civil War musical that Ryan O'neil's character makes in Irreconcilable Differences. I think it was called ""Atlanta"" and it ruined him. I can't believe it took several highly publicized psychotic meltdowns to end Mel's career. This film should have ended it on the night of the premier. M. Stowe used to be a very attractive woman.

My dad, who served in the Vietnam War also enjoyed it as it was not a film that made the United States troops look horrible, while this one puts them in a more positive light. Though I would also say that ""Full Metal Jacket"" was a rather good movie about the Vietnam War as well. This one chronicles one battle during the conflict. I think it was like one of the first involving the Vietnamese and the U.S. military and it is a very good conflict on screen as it really keeps you on edge. You also get good performances from Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot and even Greg Kinnear. The film is very emotional as you get shots of the wife of Mel Gibson's character delivering letters to wives whose husbands are killed in battle in Vietnam. There is a little humor in the film, but much after the conflict starts which is understandable as Sam Elliot has a couple of good lines before shipping out. Like I said the battle itself is very edge of your sit type stuff, you have your drama and you have some very graphic kills as the one involving the napalm was particularly nasty. The movie shifts focus from time to time though so you are not sure at times how much time has passed in certain scenes, they also seem to ignore the fact that the M-16 rifle was not exactly a great weapon in its day, instead making it nearly flawless. Which it was when kept clean, however as my dad said if it got dirty it did not fire. Overall, though this movie was a good emotional film that deserved a bit more recognition in 2002 as I think it did not get any awards at all."

They have a really rough time, the main characters lose some friends who's characters are sufficiently developed during the movie to make the viewer mourn together with the main character, by fighting hard they manage to survive and in the end we see the grief and feelings of guilt of the survivors, in this case mainly Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the story is about a battle that has really taken place, but other than that it didn't really rise above other war movies I've seen. It's an OK watch, but it's 'cliche' in the way the story goes and in the way it portrays its heroes. It misses the excellence I found in movies like Apocalypse Now or Platoon.

About all the horror. And plenty of violence. In one scene, a bomb literally blows up in a mans brain. Whilst that aspect may be relatively horrific, it doesn't do what other great war epics have: truly show the madness. When the guy is blown up, it's an American helping him, right? The fact is, in Platoon and Apocalypse now, it really showed how dreadful the war was. In this, the American flag is always waving in the breeze, with Mel heroically blowing the ""bad guys"" to bits. The only thing that is good about this is that the violence is realistic, and that it is very entertaining. But that cannot be shoved aside.

BANG!! ""arghhh""). This film really doesn't hide any of the more obvious war movie cliches and it all seems to be going down hill.<br/><br/>Thats until Barry Pepper shows up, playing Galloway, a war photographer caught in the middle of the most brutal battle. His performance sets the screen on fire, the same way he did in the Green Mile and Saving Private Ryan. This is one truly talented actor. He puts Gibson to shame, and shadows all of the movie's cheesier moments and perfects the atmosphere with his unique brand of emotion that seems to jump out of the screen and inject itself into one's soul. <br/><br/>So what should have been a terrible rendition of a vietnam war movie actually turns into an emotional rollercoaster due to this one man's efforts.

The battle scenes were decent, but the movie was a lot of fluff. There was nothing of substance. Sure, families are upset when a soldier dies, I know that, I'm not stupid.

","Like the Viet Nam war, We Were Soldiers has no plot. And also like the Viet Nam war, the movie drones on incessantly with half of America saluting it and the other half protesting that it should be ended.<br/><br/>The number of isolated incidents Hollywood can potentially mine for movies about WWII or Viet Nam or the Gulf or, more recently, the war sloganed as 'Dumb President Dumb War', is limitless - but seriously, bozos, what's the point? After the hundredth explosion and twentieth empty promise of, 'We will leave no one behind!' and fiftieth guy who dies saving his friend's life, can I now claim my membership in the 'Inured To War Movies' Club and get on with my wretched life? In other words - I GET IT! Put the fake blood down and step away from the Huey. So it's a 'true' story - WHO CARES? There's some running and shouting and explosions - and then there's some running and shouting and explosions. But it's a True Story! - SO WHAT?! Rhubarb rhubarb harumph harumph. (I didn't get a harumph outa that guy!) Tagging any story as 'true' doesn't guarantee that it's worth telling. I bought fourteen rolls of toilet paper today and spoke to a CD replication plant in Santa Ana. True story. Where's my funding?<br/><br/>Braveheart's descendant, writer/director Randall Wallace injects human involvement to the point where we shudder to imagine the loss of even one human life ¬ñ on ANY side. But this has become a tenet of modern movie-making ¬ñ the war film ironically decrying violence. 'Twould be a Profound Testament, were it not for ""All Quiet On The Western Front"", or ""Paths Of Glory"" or ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" or a hundred other previous films with deeper and larger hearts.<br/><br/>And yet, unbelievably, some slick-tongued agent was able to finagle some studio executive into conning some corporate funder into coughing up money to beat out the same old story with different names. <br/><br/>I'm not even saying that this was a 'bad' movie (in that Roger Corman/Ed Wood sense of the word), just that it was... 'unnecessary' (in that John Woo/Michael Bay sense of the word).<br/><br/>Despite its overall pointlessness, there are many surprisingly good points to this movie. The film-makers actually bothered to TRANSLATE the Vietnamese, which humanized them considerably; most movies of this ilk callously regard ""the enemy"" as faceless, unintelligent guerillas who just deserve to die ¬ñ but the choice to portray the Viet Cong making military decisions, giving pep talks to their boys in... uh, green? tope? (what WAS the color of their uniform?), allowing the Vietnamese protagonists to express feelings of horror, indecisiveness, heroism, *humanity*, almost evened out the insensitivity shown to that race in every previous war picture to date¬Ö Too late the apology ¬ñ if this movie were made in an age where war pictures were taken seriously, rather than mushed out in production-line fashion after September 11, 2001, maybe it would have made amends. Instead, it becomes indistinguishable amongst the bilious fad fodder like Black Hawk Down and Behind Enemy Lines. <br/><br/>Another plus was the portrayal of the euphemistic 'friendly fire'; I'm sure that in the course of every major battle where no one knew which way was down, up or pan-dimensional, innumerable scores of troops must have been cut down by their own men, although, we realize that in showing this ONE scene, the movie-makers absolve themselves of the implication that this type of incident was commonplace. It is handled, as we would expect Hollywood to handle it, like a mistake that happens as rarely as Dennis Miller resorts to fart jokes for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>Of course, all the maudlin attempts at heartstring-tugging were shoveled effusively down our throats, such as the birth of Chris Klein's baby and his subsequent hollow prayer, 'I don't know what god's plan is for me - I hope it's to protect orphans and not make any' - now let's qualify that statement with the word 'AMERICAN orphans', cos you sure as hell made a lot of Vietnamese orphans out on that field today, you mannequin-faced hypocrite.<br/><br/>We're aware of his massive range of acting chops, but for this movie, Mel Gibson just cupped one hand and skimmed the surface froth of that deep, deep mug. And speaking of mugs, this movie may have salvaged a few reasonable moments were it not for Mel's egregious mugging at every foreseeable opportunity. His unabashed mugging was to this movie as Chuck Heston's was to Soylent Green. He delivered many monologues, all drenched in red-whaht-en-blue; he made a lot of empty promises (most of them concerned with 'leaving no one behind' blah blah) he oozed a lot of compassion and ultimately, should have quit the movie business after making Braveheart. (Can I get a witness?!? Examine his silly repertoire after that award-winning epic: Pocahontas, Ransom, Conspiracy Theory, The Patriot, What Women Want, Lethal Weapon 4 - to name a few.).<br/><br/>So when's the next propaganda due?"

","I didn't expect much from ""We Were Soldiers"" since it was made at a time when Hollywood was encouraged to promote the US army(post 11.9). American patriotism is noticeable but they don't push it too far. A nice surprise which is sadly not exploited enough since it brings balance to all that Americana is that we get to see the other side, the Vietnamese commanders, planning and thinking how to defeat the American invaders, so this is not one of those ""kill the f....ng useless yellowskins"" type of movies.<br/><br/>It tries to be as partial as possible and for the most parts succeeds. The problem is the acting. It doesn't stand out, no particularly good performances, which is about the only big downside since the movie could really use a more personal and dramatic touch. There are maybe just one to many characters in here to fully explore them. But considering that most of the time everyone is fighting for their lives I can understand this.<br/><br/>Instead the movie really comes through in the effects department, displaying some truly spectacular visual effects and makeup(the scene where Joe Galloway picks up the burnt soldier by the legs is one of the most disgusting and disturbing things I have ever seen).<br/><br/>The end result is a solid war movie taking place in an abnormally unrealistic ""Vietnamese"" surrounding that simply doesn't have anything new to tell, quite the opposite, it becomes a victim of a recycled formula from which we, the viewers, know exactly what to expect and therefore ""We Were Soldiers"" never really stood a chance at anything, even the American box office. 7/10"
"Fenrir-5","Null","0","1","7 June 2003"," War Movie Making 101
","I'm not at all surprised that this generally terrible movie has such high ratings. It succeeds in every respect as a formulaic, jingoistic war movie - pushing all the scripted buttons in order - in a time when a love affair when all things military is in full swing.<br/><br/> That said, it is an objectionably bad movie.<br/><br/> In some ways we have Spielberg to blame. After the technically proficient but rather poorly written ""Saving Private Ryan"", there was a surge in popularity for ""real"" war movies. Making a war movie became all about how gruesome one could make the battle scenes. The stories have all been on autopilot, the same ragtag bunch of misfits spouting heroic lines that have been pushed onto the silver screen since WWII.<br/><br/> ""We Were Soldiers"" is a bad movie because it contains so little imagination, and although the battle scenes are sufficiently traumatic, the movie drags at all other times. It simply feels manipulative. From the ""Daddy, what's a war?"" moments in Mel Gibson's home to the scene where Randall Wallace speaks for the disenfranchised black man, it's just embarassing.<br/><br/> Unfortunately for Wallace it all falls on him. Sure, Gibson is coasting, doing a bad American accent and his usual hard-swallowing, not-gonna-cry emoting. But the actors can't really be blamed: it is what they are forced to say, and the way they are told to say it, that ruins this movie.<br/><br/> It is also shameful the way Wallace wraps his movie in god-and-country symbolism. Lots of scenes in churches or of flags blowing triumphantly in the breeze. Numerous statements of purpose and valor. Men on their knees in churches asking the Almighty to smite their foe.<br/><br/> Perhaps the most technically inept of Wallace's numerous trip-ups is the repeated use of an annoying Scottish lament, which most viewers have come to know as the ""Lay Me Doon"" song. It consists of mournful Scottish music and a Scotsman repeating over and over, ""Lay Meeee Dooooon ... In the cooold coold grooond ..."" It is unintentionally hilarious, mostly because he uses it like ten times.<br/><br/> I'm certain that it is technically and factually accurate, as far as the events go (something they brag about in a separate movie). One thing I can commend Wallace for is showing the folly of going back for a wounded friend - every time someone screams ""Frank, noooo!"" and goes back to pick up his buddy, you know he's done for. But as far as entertainment goes, it could have been pulled out of a WWII time capsule. It's propaganda, and poorly-written propaganda at that. Good propaganda doesn't let you know when you are being manipulated. Here we feel the strings tugging at all times.<br/><br/> I guess if you really want to be grossed out by some war footage, this is as good a place as any to turn. When I first saw it I rented it and fast-forwarded through all the ""war at home"" moments, and it was almost bearable."

","It's a curious thing about all of the films that Randall Wallace has made, but they invariably have this horrible, irritating noise on the soundtrack. Every single one, and We Were Soldiers is no exception... there it is, that insistent, nagging, formless and faintly rotten distraction.  Hearing it is like having a decaying moth twitching in your ear.<br/><br/>And stranger still, this repulsive, over-ripe interference always seems to coincide with the movement of the actors' lips.  I of course thought at first that this was just dialogue, but hah, I was young and foolish.  I know better today.  Even in the world of Modern Movies, such awful sounds couldn't seriously be intended to convey characterisation.  Nobody could seriously be so unutterably brazen in the deployment of such blatant exposition, such ugly and stupid sub-John Wayne banter - nobody who once won wrote an oscar-winning epic could seriously produce such banal and mindless wittering.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm wrong, perhaps it IS dialogue, but really... to assume that this anything more than (at most) a dadaist selection of random noises that have a semblance of meaning would be a step down the ladder of evolution.  Next I would be examining chicken entrails for their subtle messages.<br/><br/>So, defective soundtrack aside, what did I think?<br/><br/>Well, I am assured by an article I read a little while ago that this film came truly 'from the bottom of Wallace's heart'.

","""We Were Soldiers"" was entertaining and instructive but ultimately less satisfying than it might have been. In a way, I prefer pure fiction to movies based on true stories because fiction is fiction. No one implies it actually happened (except the producers of ""Fargo""). With movies based on true stories one must always wonder what actually happened and what was changed in the name of dramatic license. I suspect things in ""We Were Soldiers"" were changed to (A) play up the involvement of the soldiers' wives and (B) to emphasize the whole honorable soldier image. For example, when Lt. Col. Moore exchanges salutes with the Huey pilot at the end of the battle. Maybe it happened. But I doubt it. A similar scenario played out for real during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in World War II. Commander Ernest E. Evans, captain of the USS Johnston, was wounded and conning his damaged ship by standing on the fantail shouting orders to men steering the ship by hand. He looked up and saw the captain of another damaged American ship, a man he knew. And he waved. If they ever make a movie about the Battle of Leyte Gulf (and I hope they do) they'll probably have Evans salute. But I digress. ""We Were Soldiers"" suffers from the Hollywood version of heroism and honor, which must nowadays include graphic violence a la ""Saving Private Ryan."" I have mixed feelings about this form of realism. It illustrates the hell of battle much better than the no-blood war movies I grew up with. And that's a service. However, I think it's deliberately overdone in many cases as movie makers see it as an audience-pleaser. An early version of battle realism in the movies occurs in the 1968 film ""Anzio."" Little or no blood is visible in the movie until Corporal Rabinoff (played by Peter Falk) is killed, at which point the blood gushes from his neck. It works as realism, and it works cinematically because it comes as such a shock. The same goes for profanity. The 1968 movie ""Bullitt"" is almost profanity-free until the end when Steve McQueen says ""Bulls***!"" to Robert Vaughn. The line is 10 times more effective because so little profanity has preceded it."

The violence was interesting (the napalm injuries almost made me hurl), but the script...ye gods!  Actually, it read like Braveheart in so many ways in that you can almost utter the lines before the actor does because each situation which can provide a stock, boring and predictable piece of dialogue DOES.  Randall Wallace is a one-note screenwriter, and it's a very flat note at that.  I mean, ""Tell my wife I love her?"" and ""How can I forgive myself that my boys died and I didn't?""  Haven't we heard these lines scads of times before?

Another movie that has this same receipe is Black Hawk Down, but BHD was an excellent movie with an amazing central peformance by Josh Hartnett and solid supporting performances that made the movie memorable in every respect.  This movie, because it was basically a Mel Gibson vehicle, gave him the only meat to work with and short-shrifted the others.

I genuinely feel for the soldiers when I see just what they are subjected to in combat. ""Black Hawk Down"" left me wanting to know more about the brave rangers.

"wfzelle","6","0","1","15 October 2002"," Ok, but nothing special
","--SPOILERS--<br/><br/>The movie has an excellent start in which we see both the dangers of Vietnam and the misguided feelings of superiority exhibited by the politicians and military top brass. Unfortunately the movie quickly degenerates after that. The soldiers and their families who are presented to us are mostly cardboard hero's. We see their heroic wives and adorable children. These are all things that we already know. We know that the soldiers have family and might get killed, we know that their wives are lonely. The awful cliches don't add any more sympathy. Why don't we get to see the men as real people and learn more about their motivations. Why did they decide to join the army? Patriotism? Did they think the job was easy? What did the wives of these soldiers really feel about the dangers the men decided to face?<br/><br/>The battle itself is a mixed bag. When the camera zooms close to the soldiers in the dark, the movie is very eerie and I could strongly feel their anxiety. On the other hand, the spell was regularly broken by the one-sided portrayal of the events. The Vietnamese let themselves be gunned down a bit too easily, I'd expect them to use a bit more caution. But what really got to me was the close combat which only showed Americans stabbing and hitting Vietnamese. I don't understand why they didn't show the reverse as well. In fact, we rarely see a Vietnamese soldier killing someone (the camera is usually trained only on the American soldier who gets shot), while the camera usually shows both the American soldier and his target. Perhaps this was an attempt to prevent us from hating the Vietnamese. It seems that we are only suppose to have feelings for two Vietnamese characters, an educated soldier and the Vietnamese commander. The first is some cardboard character caught in a situation he shouldn't be in (or something like that). The diary he is carrying is only used to show us a picture of his wife, even though we hear after the battle that part of the diary is translated. I thought it was a perfect set-up for something deep and profound, a statement that could tell us more about the Vietnamese soldiers and their motivations, hopes and fears. Alas, we get no such thing and forget the soldier immediately. The other character is far more memorable. Although a movie is hardly the place to expound tactical issues, we get the impression of a chivalric fight between the two commanders. The decisions we can comprehend seem sound and we certainly don't lose respect for the Vietnamese commander, even though he loses. His acting is very restrained and powerful, he shows his love for his men in just a few moments. A huge contrast to Mel Gibson who overacts his bravery, his sadness and his feelings for his men.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent. Weapons, explosions and aircraft look very realistic. We get to see a lot of gore, which seems realistic most of the time (sometimes a body is thrown back by a gunshot, that doesn't really happen). I do think that the movie would be better off if more was left to the imagination. The slow-motions we see when some main characters are hit are especially overdone. Now and then the attempts to get us emotionally involved seem extremely contrived. The Japanese-American soldier tells the reporter that his wife will have a baby that day, after which he dutifully gets a mortal wound. He dies, but not before he asks the reporter to tell his wife he loves her. Right.<br/><br/>There are some side stories during the battle. We see the telegrams being delivered to recent widows. The director shows the uncertainty and the comradery on the home front in a fresh way which is very effective. We also get to see a strange brawl between the helicopter pilot and some other guy about landing in a hot LZ. It doesn't fit in the story at all.<br/><br/>At the end the movie loses itself to cliches again. We see two soldiers coming home with nobody waiting at the terminal. A few widows (including the wife of the Vietnamese soldier) get messages from the survivors. Mel gets to hug his wife and children. The reporter writes the true story of the battle. Yawn. Why don't we learn a bit more about the feelings of the soldiers and widows? The movie only shows change in a few characters, the reporter becomes a warrior for a while when pressed until he decides that he his real calling is to inform, not to be part of this awful war. A cocksure soldier finds out why the sergeant doesn't take him seriously. Still, the stories are far to superficial. They only hint at what could have been, but don't manage to tell us anything truly interesting. Mel seems to have changed. Because the soldiers remind him of his children, he becomes very attached to his men, to the point of becoming irrational and feeling ashamed because he didn't die as well. Unfortunately this is glossed over as he returns home. Can he ever lead men into battle again? I doubt it, but the movie never tells us what happens next. Does he resign from the army? Does he manage to detach himself sufficiently to send men into situations where many will die again?<br/><br/>I think that your appreciation of this movie will mostly depend on what kind of person you are. If you can stand the shallowness and the cliches, you will probably like the movie very much. On the other hand, if you prefer to analyse a movie, the many flaws will certainly not escape your attention. I could still value the fairly accurate battle scenes and the occasional flash of brilliance, but it wasn't enough to rate this movie higher than 6/10."

","Mel Gibson stars as General Harold Moore, who wrote the book, so we know before the film begins that he makes good on his promise to his young daughter, to not let the Viet Cong ""take his life away."" But in the end he says, ""I'll never forgive myself - that my men died and I didn't."" The film covers a key battle in November 1965 that occurs over three days, but Moore served for over 9 more months in Viet Nam. <br/><br/>However, this film is only secondarily about a battle fought almost 40 years ago. Instead, it is really about the wives and children left behind, waiting for their husbands and fathers to return, or for the dreaded telegram delivered as a death notice. We get to know the wives and children stationed at Ft Bragg, Georgia. We see the young mothers and their babies, the wives getting together for companionship. The peaceful life between telegrams, the grief upon delivery of the next one. Moore's wife actually takes on the task herself, getting the telegrams from the cab driver, and delivering them personally, comforting her friends. And finally, the return of her own husband, a deeply religious man who can barely accept the loss of his men.<br/><br/>I saw this film on DVD, but did not get to look at any of the extras. The battle scenes are among the best ever filmed, although they took pains to make them as graphic and gory as possible. I suppose that helps us to really detest war. The surround sound is used to good effect, you can hear bullets and helicopters surrounding you during the heat of battle. However the video transfer is just ordinary, more grainy than most current releases, but adequately sharp.<br/><br/>As the story ends, we hear Moore's voice-over as a young American wife reads his letter of condolences, looking at her deceased husband's photo, and the camera dissolves into a young Vietnamese wife reading a similar letter while looking at a photo of her deceased husband's photo. And we see the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, a sober message during these times when our own president, who stayed far from the Viet Nam war, is now threatening war against Iraq. Sobering thoughts."

","Have we seen this type of movie before? Yes we have, but better. Overly sentimental dramatisation of real events that took place in Vietnam in 1965. From a military aspect, elements of the film are real, but what detracts from the realism is the lack of depth to the characters. Added to this are a number of disturbing factors:-<br/><br/>1) The Seargent Major's (Sam Elliots) amazing ability to dodge bullets whilst standing perfectly still in the middle of the battlefield, as all his men around him are killed. 2) The film looks like it was shot in my back garden (really) and most certainly NOT the jungles of Vietnam.                                   3) The continual repetition of 'Tell my wife I love her' everytime a soldier was shot.<br/><br/>Now granted, the gore was well handled and we got the standard thematic music played over the slo-mo battle shots (a la Braveheart), but unlike Braveheart, Vietnam has been well documented and dramatising it only serves to detatch us from that realism. Some have argued that this film shows us how futile war really is. To them I say, do you really need to watch this movie to realise that?<br/><br/>
This film is cliche-ridden and brings absolutely nothing to the genre. It seems to point at Wallace's desire to pull on our heartstrings using the dramatisation of historical events, but it isn't Braveheart and nor is it Saving Private Ryan.

","If I remember a movie clearly six months or more after I've seen it, then it counts as a ""good movie"" in my books. ""We Were Soldiers"" is one of those truly memorable movies.<br/><br/> In this outing, Mel Gibson employs the charm and trademark what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of honesty he's known for. However, his performance, as good as it is, doesn't quite live up to the standard he established in Braveheart. Even so, the almost naive, bright-eyed and utterly earnest demeanour Gibson exhibits in his role as Colonel Moore is well-nigh perfect.<br/><br/> As usual, Gibson steals the show, with the other cast members taking supportive or entirely peripheral roles. Which is as it should be, since the movie is intended to be a visual recreation of the experiences Colonel Hal Moore wrote about in ""We Were Soldiers Once... and Young"". However, the desultory performances from the supporting cast tend to hold back the plot development somewhat and leave the entire movie with a constrained feeling in places.<br/><br/> Others who have posted reviews about this movie criticize Gibson's jingoism and cloying 'my country right or wrong' patriotism. These individuals seem to have missed a crucial point - the purpose behind the patriotism is not to support some pre-conceived political agenda, but rather to illustrate the kind of patriotic feeling that was so prevalent in the United States of 1965.<br/><br/> The battle scenes are breathtaking in their violence - and historical and technical accuracy. The opening scene of the movie, which portrays one of many firefights during the ill-starred French Army defence of Dien Bien Phu, has a brutal realism I've never seen in any other war movie made to date. The Viet Cong soldiers seen in the later parts of the movie are accurately portrayed as the skilled, brave, tactically shrewd, and formidable foes they were.<br/><br/> The main battle scene loses some of its punch because it's overly long. Worse, it's marred by overuse of a droning Gaelic-flavoured lament that never seems to end. Used sparingly, this piece of music could have helped the battle scene become stunning instead of boring. The lame dialogue heard in this part of the movie doesn't help.<br/><br/> The portrayal of the war correspondent who suddenly becomes a master marksman in the heat of the moment stretches credibility so far it's laughable.<br/><br/> Finally, the scene which shows the reaction of the wives as they learn of their husbands' deaths has a depth of pathos and sensitivity that has to be seen to be believed. It even brought a tear or two to my eyes.<br/><br/> All in all, We Were Soldiers is a basically good war movie which could have been supported by a better script. What sets it apart from other Vietnam War flicks is the fact that it examines and accurately portrays the earliest phase of US involvement in Vietnam.<br/><br/> Grade: B(-)"

","Hmm.  Hard to know where to start.<br/><br/>First of all, it needs to be said that it is absolutely impossible to ""spoil"" this movie; that is, give away something crucial in the plot or character development that a new viewer would want to be a surprise.  Do people agree with me that this movie can't be ""spoiled""?<br/><br/>There's a chance this movie might/could be construed as a verite revelation of the depths of self-deception, abuse-of-power, and might-driven neocolonialism into which the US had sunk by that time.  I mean, think about it:  Imagine Mel and the gang really believing that the ""wheels"" would never, ever, ever abuse the sacred trust of the military contract--the contract in which they agree to exchange their lives for the defense of their country--by sending deadly power where it has absolutely no business being.<br/><br/>That might have made for a good, even redemptive, motivating idea behind this movie.  Unfortunately, I can't grant this redemptive interpretation.<br/><br/>I suspect the movie is trying to say something grand; dare I say ""new""; about heroism, and its highest expression.  To address this, I'm going to compare the climactic ""heroic"" moment from this movie to the climactic ""heroic"" moment from the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie.  Sad to say; they're comparable.<br/><br/>Remember the Jurassic Park theme music?  John Williams wrote sundry variations on that theme for use in mood-setting in the movie.  At the end, when Our Heroes are about to get pounced upon by a raptor, the rex snatches the raptor in mid-pounce and shakes it about in apparent reptilian thrill-of-the-chase glee.  Listen to what happens in the sound track: That's the moment when they deploy the ""heroic"" orchestration of the Jurassic Park theme by Williams.  But:  Why are they playing a heroic theme? The rex isn't a hero!  She isn't ""Lassie""!  She didn't ""save"" our protagonists; she was hungry!  There's a nasty and insulting dissonance between the music and the depicted event that deprives the movie of any redeeming value it might have retained up to that point.  It's insulting because it blythely assumes you're not going to notice.<br/><br/>The same thing happened at the ""big"" moment at the end of We Were Soldiers. It's the scene where Mel and the (surviving) gang walk over a ridge, into a line of VC.  At that moment, when it appears a VC gunner is about to plug Mel (oh my God!  Not *MEL*!), the day is saved by air support, and we're treated to an enchanting 5+ minute slo-mo hi-tech blood fest where massive air support absolutely riddles the VC lines with a cats-and-dogs hail of hot lead.  Bring up the ""triumphal"", ""heroic"" theme, the one that informs us that we can all relax in the sure knowledge that Mel will get his millions. The VC blood is flowing like champagne at a debutante ball.  It's party time!  But where's the heroism in this?  It's not heroic!  It's just as dissonant in this regard as the scene at the end of Jurassic Park!  When one bank robber blows away a cop about to nab his accomplice, he's not a hero.<br/><br/>I'll tell you who the heros are.<br/><br/>The real heros in this story are the people who spent vast resources over the last 25 years to save us from having to face the moral debacle of Vietnam.  They've spent billions of dollars and countless light-years of celluloid to remind us that a technologically advanced people who traveled thousands of miles to a primitive agrarian culture to maim and kill those who resisted our socioeconomic intrusions are, at heart, a well-meaning bunch of folks, really just wanting to bring the light of democracy and freedom to rice farmers.<br/><br/>I've thought about the Vietnam movies.  Doesn't it seem like each one hopes to drive the last nail into the coffin of that legacy?  Do we need yet another nail?  Isn't this hapless coffin bristling with nails, looking by now like a porcupine?  Wouldn't that tell you something?  What it tells me is that these movies aren't nails.  They're countless cinematic makeup specialists trying to give the corpse the final ""makeover"" that will finally convince us of the lie we want so bad to believe, but never will, because there's a place deep down inside each of us that knows it will die once and for all if we believe a lie that big and that ugly.  And I'm talking about the lie that says our intentions in Vietnam were good, and we were there defending freedom and democracy.<br/><br/>This movie is yet another corpse makeover masquerading as a nail in the coffin.  Reject it.  Get informed.  If you give a rat's a*s, read up on Vietnam, weep over our hubris, apologize to those wounded by that legacy, vow to do what you can to return our military heritage to that envisioned by the founders:  The defense of our territory from intrusion from outsiders; not a tool in the hands of global economic power junkies.  Scrape the countless layers of makeup off the corpse, grieve over it, bury it, and move on."

","Yes, there have been lots of Vietnamn war movies and yes many have been more deep and meaningful (the excellent Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter). But this film seemed to capture the time as well as the place. It is November 1965 before the drugs, fragging and general collapse of moral purpose set in. We still felt we were doing the right thing, the draft was just cranking up and sons of WWII vets were ready and willing to be blooded. The experience they found and the real horror of combat came as a shock to young men who were raised on the stories of their elders. And yes, this is very ""Hollywood"" (notice that no trees are actually blown up?- very PC), but one can get past that.  The authenticity of the emotional feel of the film would have been improved if all of the actors playing the grunts could have been 18-19 years old.

","When I was asked to see this movie, I was keen, but also cautious, that this might be just another one of those ¬ëwar movie' flicks. Yet to my surprise I really enjoyed what this film had to offer. It shows that no one totally wins in war. I also enjoyed the personal level this film had to it, giving the audience a chance to feel for the men on the battlefield and the women and families, who at anytime might hear some devastating news. ¬ëWe were soldiers' will stir even the most toughened of movie fans, and reduce them near to tears!<br/><br/>On 14 November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley of Vietnam, more than 400 troopers from the U.S. 7th Air Cavalry found themselves outnumbered. Nearly 2000 enemy soldiers surrounded them in a small clearing called Landing Zone, and they had to fight like they'd never fought before. This fact-based tale of men under fire and their acts of valour and loyalty to one another is what became the first--and perhaps the worst--major battle of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>The cast of any war film must be extremely proud and conscious of what they are portraying. Having an actor such as Mel Gibson in the leading role, is a perfect example of that. He was brilliant as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, who must have been a truly brilliant war fighter in real life. I found Gibson's character to be very compassionate in situations that would usually require him to be totally merciless, and out for the kill. Gibson was made for this war role, with his other war film the classic, ¬ëGallipoli', a truly great film in its own right.<br/><br/>Thanks to this film, I have finally seen a decent performance from young actor, Chris Klein. His role had plenty of class and emotion. I enjoyed how he asks, ¬ëdoes a good soldier, make you a better father?' I am sure that many fathers must ask that of themselves as they go into battle, a fair evaluation of too. I know I have been critical of Klein before, but if he can do more work like this, than I am confident he will become a better actor. Someone else, who I have been a little unsure of in an acting sense, is Greg Kinnear. He has been in films like ¬ëSomeone like you', which was a great film, and a disappointing role in the farcical movie, ¬ëLoser'. Yet for me, Kinnear has not done many roles that have stood out to me, such as his role in the classic romantic comedy ¬ëAs Good As It Gets'. That is up until now. His role as a leading chopper pilot in the Vietnam War was terrific. Being a chopper pilot must have been a very demanding, and this role also shows how tense a place war can and must be.   <br/><br/>There were plenty of other roles in this film that deserve praise that I have no room to mention. All of the women were great, showing the other ¬ëworrying' side to the war. The main woman that I want to point out, was the beautiful, Madeline Stowe, who was great as the Colonel Moore's wife. I found her to bring a feeling to this movie, that I felt it needed, but was not too over the top. Then take the role of funny Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, he was played very well by Sam Elliot. His character's very cynical comment towards all the soldiers was humorous to watch in such a tense and high-risk film.<br/><br/>The story to ¬ëWe were soldiers', was for me, very satisfying. I enjoyed how we first had the chance to see the build up to being chosen to fight in the war, and then the transition to the battlefield was also brought well to the screen. Yet the best part of this story was how viewers get to see, what I call the other side to war, how it affects the people back home. That whole part had me very interested, and really kept the film alive and entertaining. Of course this film was adapted from the novel of the same name, and whether the story is completely accurate I am not so sure of, but the in the end it did not hamper the story in anyway at all for me. I also must give praise to the work of director, Randal Wallace, who did a very good job in bring this film to our screens. I especially like the end of the film, and the tribute that he gave to the certain soldiers in the Vietnam War. I really was impressed by this section of the film.<br/><br/>This film really does give a graphic insight into how bad war must have been. No one wins from war, because the fatality count is just too high for one side to announce ¬ëwe won'. If you are considering watching this film please take note: this film is extremely confronting as it is graphic in picture and emotional in story, (well it was in my case anyhow). To say that I am thankful for not having to fight in war would be an understatement. Yet let me also say that ¬ëGod Bless' every soldier who has taken foot on a battlefield anywhere in the world!<br/><br/>CMRS gives ¬ëWe were soldiers: 4.5 (Very Good ¬ñ Brilliant Film)"
"rosemarie-1","Null","0","1","18 June 2002"," We Were Soldiers, Were You?
","I am extremely disappointed by some of the commentaries that have been posted regarding the reviews of ""We Were Soldiers."" As a former Marine, as well as someone who actually read the book ""We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young"" prior to viewing the movie, I feel that this movie was an extremely accurate portrayal of the book into film format. Any movie that has the author's approval (as former Lt.Col, now retired General Moore has given) is good enough for me. The man was there and finds that the movie accurately portrayed what he was trying to bring into focus with the written word. For those of you that find that this movie is not in the ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" genre, you're right . . .because it portrays a different and more pro-U.S and pro-military timeframe in the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War that General Moore was portraying in his book, and that Wallace brought to the screen is not, and was not supposed to, in my view, be the later war of the early and mid 1970's that those movies bring to life. This movie was of the U.S.' early involvement in the war and the patriotism and mind-set of that time-frame, not the Vietnam War of ""Platoon"" or similarly negative viewpoints. The movie did not glorify war, nor sugar-coat why the U.S. was involved, but rather offered a viewpoint of the men (and their families and their women) that fought it and why they volunteered to do so. The basic premise of both the book and the movie  was that men fight on the battle field, not for glory or honor, but for the comraderie (or love) of the man next to him. Admitedly, there wasn't enough time to go into the thorough characterizations that many would have preferred on the individual character, but how long do you think the movie could have lasted then? I do believe that for the best appreciation of this movie, it should serve as a companion piece to the book, then you could fill in all the gaps that many have noted they feel are weaknesses of the movie. But seldom have I went to see a movie after reading the book first, that I felt was more aptly truthful to the book. And yes, there was some flag-waving and sugar-sweet moments early on, but they ARE accurate to a point as well. The best of the military will tell you that they train for war, not for love of it, but to better prepare and defend their country in time of it. The entire nation (and world for that matter) always missed the point, as far as I am concerned, about the Vietnam War. You can, and rightly so, abhor what occured in Vietnam; however, at no time EVER should the men and women  who fought, sacrificed, suffered and died been made the victims of the public's scorn for U.S involvement. In short, the book is great, the film is excellent, and I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. Even if it is biased, uninformed, and dangerously narrow-minded. Semper Fi!"

"chrisbrown6453","5","0","2","12 June 2002"," ""We Were Soldiers"" is based on the real¬ñlife events of November 14th 1965, when American troops fought their first major battle in Viet Nam.
","Around four hundred men of the First Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry (General Custer¬ës former regiment!) were surrounded by nearly two thousand North Vietnamese soldiers for three days, and the battle went down in US military history as one of the most savage the country¬ës forces were ever involved in. Writer/director Randall Wallace (who also supplied the screenplay for Mel Gibson¬ës multiple award winning ""Braveheart"") adapted his screenplay from the book written by two of the battle¬ës survivors; the man who lead his troops into battle, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore ¬ñ Mel Gibson, in the film¬ës leading role ¬ñ and war photographer Joseph Gallway (played by Barry Pepper). <br/><br/>A number one movie at the US box office, the film is undoubtedly at its best when it recreates the battle itself, and its to Wallace¬ës credit that we can actually follow its progress tactically, as Moore constantly tries to outwit his North Vietnamese counterpart to ensure his troops¬ë survival. As we¬ëve come to expect in these post ""Saving Private Ryan"" days the portrayal of warfare itself is brutal and shocking, with the threat of sudden death and terrifying wounds almost constantly present, and a total reliance upon your fellow soldiers. While its impossible to have nothing but respect for the troops involved in the actual battle, what might prove a little too much for English audience¬ës is the film¬ës ""God Bless America"" moral righteousness and flag waving jingoism, particularly in the scenes involving the soldiers in training, their families back home, and that final shot of the stars and stripes. It¬ës also unfortunate that the film follows so closely on the heels of Ridley Scott¬ës ""Black Hawk Down,"" which not only dealt with many of the same themes but also had the advantage of a visionary director at the helm; by comparison ""We Were Soldiers"" is somewhat leaden and ¬ñ admittedly, perhaps because it¬ës a set almost forty years ago ¬ñ distinctly old fashioned."

","Mel Gibson's blockbuster We Were Soldiers is a solid war Movie. All the issues revolving around the Characters are balanced with skill and accuracy and great care. Gibson stars as Lt Colonel Hal Moore, who wrote the story. Moore is a family man (Madeleine Stowe plays the missus), a religious man, and knows how to get the job done in a battle. He is put in charge of an Air Cavalry unit which use helicopters. They fly in, kill, blow the crap out of everything and get out again. With the help of Sargent Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott) they put together the 1st regiment, 7th cavalry. With young troops and untested battle plans they are dropped into the La Dang Valley in Vietnam which becomes known as the 'Valley Of Death'. About 400 young soldiers are soon surrounded by some 2000 North Vietnamese and it's not a pretty sight. There is nearly total panic from the word go as the regiment is forced to split in different directions. It's wall to wall carnage as the slaughter on both sides goes on for three days. Realistic battle scenes fill the screen and with dying troops scattered all over the place, it is reminiscent of the inside of an abattoir. This battle is well known as it was responsible for getting the Americans involved in the Vietnam War big time, and we all know how that went.  Bad news telegrams to loved ones back home, body bags by the dozen, acts of heroism; it's all there and is in-your-face as you can get. The real Hal Moore was there in real life and his portrayal is obviously spot on, more the pity. Special mention must be made of Barry Pepper who plays war photographer/reporter Joe Galloway. Insane is the only word to describe this character. And at nearly two and a half hours you will wonder where the time went."

","`We Were Soldiers' is yet another Vietnam movie. This time we're recounting the true-life story of Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), leading his squad into one of the few battles that the American forces won in the war.<br/><br/>I'm quite surprised to see the high rating this movie has achieved on IMDB. Perhaps it's a sign of the times affecting people's critical centres, or maybe I'm missing something, but this movie is nothing but forgettable and average for a number of reasons. The acting is solid but unspectacular. Gibson is perfect for the role of the affable, charismatic-but-human leader, and doesn't need to extend his talent here ¬ñ there's nothing to challenge him. It's `The Patriot' for the 1960s. The rest of the cast accredit themselves by not grating, apart from some hysterical melodrama on the parts of the actresses who represent the soldiers' wives.<br/><br/>What of the script and plot? The first forty minutes are TV-movie-of-the-week fare. They're also brimming with hammy deliveries and moments with enough cheese to put France out of business. Think I'm kidding? Then explain the laughter from the cinema audience I was a part of, as the movie kicks into sentimental moments when Moore says his farewells to his family, and pontificates from his altar to his troops about their war effort. The movie tries to win the audience by creating overtly-sympathetic characters with `perfect' families of cute little kids, or ¬ñ in one case ¬ñ a brand new baby to look after. Rather than allow us to admire the characters solely for their action or deeds, we're given forced empathy because of those they leave behind. As the movie progresses, and some characters die, we're left with a turgid plot line involving the remaining wives delivering soldier's death notices. Irrelevant of the reality its based on, the scene are delivered in an over-the-top fashion that relegates the actual truth to some bizarre, too-sentimental mush.<br/><br/>The direction, handled by Randall Wallace, is similarly in your face. The battles aren't boring, so much as average. It's also done very traditionally ¬ñ countless times, I was able to predict the death of the next soldier due to the weak set-up of the moment (slow motion, turns around in a particular manner, et cetera). This shreds the movie of any sense of suspense, and makes for a much more un-involving passive experience. There are some moments when Wallace really goes-to-town and actually makes you wince ¬ñ a particular photo moment, overlaying the battles, is extremely cringe-inducing. The only real noticeable work of Wallace is the helicopter flights, which tend to look quite pretty as they fly through the air, but that's kinda it.<br/><br/>Don't think `We Were Soldiers' is a dreadful movie. It ain't. It's just not a very good one. It doesn't touch the Vietnam trio of `Full Metal Jacket', `Apocalypse Now' and `Platoon'. As a movie, apart from whatever memories it may evoke, it can only get from me an average rating. And that's a 4.8/10."

","I recently went and saw this movie with my father, who lost his own father in Vietnam.  While I never knew my grandfather, I could only watch with stunned amazement as one of the best retellings of the early conflict in Vietnam was projected before me.<br/><br/>Intense and evocative of the chaos and madness which must be a part of any battle, I could at the same time feel a closeness to my grandfather (in the part of Lt. Col. Hal Moore) that I have never held before.  The power and intensity of the emotions which this movie brought to bear on me I can still feel days after viewing, and I am left with a lingering sadness and feeling of loss for all of the Vietnam Veterans who gave their lives, their bodies, and their families in the name of duty and friendship.<br/><br/>My mouth still has a bitter taste after seeing the method in which the initial deaths were reported to their families.  Having once served in the USN (and having seen my father retire out of the US Army), I could not believe the callousness displayed on the part of the US Government in bringing word to these soldiers loved ones.  When the call to serve is answered, it is only fitting that the government take responsibility for its actions and give notice to the families befitting the sacrifice of their son, father or husband.<br/><br/>If Lt. Col. Moore was even 1/10th the man he was made out to be on the screen, I would have been proud to serve under him at any time, and I can only imagine his men held him in the same regard.  While Sgt. Major Plumley gave much needed levity to the action, the stoic endurance and ability of his character is seen throughout the senior NCO's of our military and I cannot thank them enough for their inspired and unflagging leadership as well.<br/><br/>The terrible losses, the poignant list of faults that the French Army suffered from (and the Americans found to be true for themselves as well), left me feeling unbelievably saddened for our soldiers.  And then the inspiration and uplifting prayers which held our soldiers together and in the end led them to a victory which to me seemed near 'miraculous.'<br/><br/>The way the movie shows the political and military viewpoints, and even more in that it shows the Vietnamese soldier as a competent and ably led foe, were telling points, and ones that make this movie strike me as more factual than many others.  Based on my own research into the Vietnam Conflict and by what I have read of Joe Galloway's and Gen. Moore's research and desires on their novel, I think this is one of the best retellings of the actual events one could hope for.<br/><br/>Although the impact that the 2nd of the 7th had is not discussed in the movie (most likely due to constraints), I cannot help but sit here and think how tough that Lt. Col. Moore's battles must have been, knowing what he did and how badly it was likely to go (based on his own observations of poor intelligence, fighting in an enemy's home terrain, fighting half a world away from his own family, and all of the other instances which showed the Americans having the same difficulties that the French had had previously).<br/><br/>I can only suggest that anyone interested in the Vietnam War, or in the trials and tribulations which soldiers of any nationality go through take the time to see this movie.  It is one of the best I have ever seen and although it left both myself and my father emotionally drained at it's end, I plan on adding it to my video collection when it becomes available."

Some truly horrific warfare of course takes up most of the film, but the film does also let you spend some time with the wives back home (Madeline Stowe and ""Felicity"" vet Keri Russell are the only recognizable ones) so you can get some sense of what they go through as well.. the film also shows a few scenes of the Vietcong commanders and treats them as real people rather than the charactures that so often end up in American war movies.  Chris Klein, however,  is somewhat miscast as a young soldier, just as he was miscast as an action hero in ""Rollerball.."" he really should stick to comedies like the ""American Pie"" movies that made him famous.

","I expected this film to be a lot better than it was, but I guess I could say it dissapointed me. The movie was a tribute to vietnam war veterans, and that is something they truly deserve. I thought Full Metal Jacket and Platoon were better than We Were Soldiers, but that doesnt mean the movie was bad. It's just that it paled in comparison to those two classics. However I thought it was better than the Deer Hunter and Apocalypse now. It was more emotional, and Mel Gibson was at his best in this film. I liked the way he portrayed Col. Moore as a good man with a heart, who represented the bravery of all who served in nam. God bless the veterans who served in this war. Definatly in the top ten list as far as war flicks go, but not better than Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan. The b plot in the movie was about the soldiers wives, and it came at the wrong moments in the film, during battle scenes, and that took away the feeling of being on the battle field with the soldiers.

","This is a pretty well made film about the Vietnam War, but I just felt it was lacking something.  I just didn't feel the power and poignancy I did while watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" and certain other war epics.  But it does deliver a good message about patriotism.  There are a few genuinely touching scenes, including one where Madeline Stowe (who plays Gibson's wife) sees a cabbie approaching her doorstep with a telegram.  It turns out he's not there to report her husband's death, but to see if she can help locate a certain addressee.  She gets furious at him, for giving her such a scare.  As he heads back to the cab, he says ""I'm sorry, I don't like delivering these messages.""  That's when she takes the initiative, and offers to deliver the telegrams herself.  <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is remarkable as the great Lt. Hal Moore.  I can tell he researched the role extensively.  He's so convincing that I sometimes forgot I was watching Mel Gibson on screen!  Greg Kinnear is miscast in a small role.  I know he got nominated for an Oscar, and he is moderately talented, but he's not convincing as a soldier.  Barry Pepper, who I've heard of but never seen before, is great as the reporter-turned-hero.  He's a new, up-and-coming actor and he's destined for success.  And Madeline Stowe gives a quietly powerful performance as Moore's wife.  <br/><br/>""We Were Soldiers"" is far from terrible and far from great.  I definitely disagree with my narrow-minded Dad when he called it a ""junk picture.""  He was simply disgusted by the extreme violence, and totally missed the point: the movie is not designed for entertainment!  But as I said, it lacked a certain something.  I walked out of the theater, crying, like I always do after watching a war movie.  But it was long and boring and dragging at points.  However, I'm sure if you were in the Vietnam War, you will be much more moved.  So if you were, please ignore my comments. <br/><br/>

This makes the movie seem like you are an army man. It was very nice of the people who made this movie, to include in the credits, the people who actually fought in the Vietnam War, in the particular area where this movie was set What I didn't like about this movie was because it should have been more violent.

","I seem to notice that MOST of the bad comments made about this movie are from ""Foreigners"" who have no idea WHY this movie was made. WHY:The book was written in 1993 by Lt Gen. Hal Moore & Joe Galloway. to describe the events on what happened in forgotten battlefield in Vietnam, which lasted three days. It book tells about the men of the 1st air cavalry and their first encounter with the North Vietnamese Army both historicaly and personally. It had nothing to do with ""whys"" and the ""hows"" of why the Vietnam war started just the men of of both sides of that particular battle and the effects of what happened on the home front. The movie just depicts what was written. To the Europeans who think this nothing but flag waving; ""Rourke's Drift"",""Battle of Dunkirk"",""Battle of Britain"",""Waterloo"",""Bridge on the river Kwai"",""Sergent X"",""A bridge too far"",""Tumbledown moutain"" and more recently ""Braveheart"",""Horatio Horn Blower""(this I know is largely fictitious but does refer to many actual battles between England,France & Spain) and ""Bravo Two Zero"" and many more to mention. All these depicts battles involving countries other than the ""AMERICANS"". All these started out as either footnotes in history, which would have been forgotten, or somebody decided to write a book about it. When someone read the book,or the history note he/she/they decided to make a movie of it. When someone in your country decides to make a war movie. let me know so I can comment on it. And I will be fair. If it was from a book of an actual battle then I'll take that into consideration. FACT: WAR movies involve death ,dying, decapitation,dismemberment,dispair,killing,rape,murder and all the other ""CLICHES"" you all hate (that actual goes on in a war,see ""SAVIOR"" with Dennis Quad or ""Nanking"").

Most people in any branch of the military aren't going to be English professors with extensive vocabularies, and during war, especially a battle, there's not a lot of time to really convey your emotions and thoughts into extensive sentences. Also, these are real people, believe it or not.  I've seen this movie, it's very well done considering that it doesn't make anyone out to be more than they are, you live and die as a team.  I can't speak from experience being that I'm fairly young, but I've heard my fair share of stories from vets, and any of them will let you know a few facts that this movie demonstrates very well, 1) It wasn't pretty over there in the least, people died both good and bad.  2) You didn't have time to do much but get the job done and move on. 3) Both sides were pretty determined to win, and both had their strong and weak moments.

","I can't really say I loved the movie, because it doesn't seem right to say you love a movie that shows us armchair critics a glimpse in the life of soldiers at war. It p***es me off that people say ""Oh the movie wasn't historically accurate"". I personally don't give a rats ass if it was letter perfect or embellished a little, that's not important in this kind of movie. Make all the comments you like about Pearl Harbor, that film was full of pretty boys and it did nothing but tiptoe around the story in fear of stepping on peoples toes or losing certain sections of the movie-going audiences.<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers is one of the most confronting films I've ever seen. The scene where the burnt soldier is lifted by the legs was horrible, I had to turn my head. The wives at home were well portrayed. How could you live a normal life knowing your husband is at war and all it takes is the dreaded telegram to shatter your very concept of existence? But the image that will<br/><br/>stick with me the most was when Snakeshit took his chopper back to base and the inside was getting hosed down, with all the blood of the dead and injured soldiers washing down the sides.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear did justice in his role as the helicopter pilot ""SnakeShit"", those guys had balls beyond belief. Chris Klein, I groaned almost out loud when I saw him, thinking he'd be the pretty boy of the film, but his character ""Jack Geoghegan"" was just a guy, there to do his duty. Barry Pepper, who played the real life photographer ""Joseph Galloway"" was really good. Another character who was understated, but a vitally important part of the telling of the tale. Sam Elliott injected the humour into the film as ""Sergeant Major Plumley"".<br/><br/>Mel Gibson was brilliant, he did his role, this wasn't his story and he didn't take over the film as one might expect. This was the story of Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and his fellow soldiers, and their time in the Ia Drang Valley.<br/><br/>My final thought and statement, would have to be that never, ever again, will I give the major movie critics the support by reading their reviews. They are for the most part a jaded, cynical bunch who should have long ago stopped watching films as it is so blatently clear they no longer enjoy their jobs. This film slaps people in the face and makes them sit up in their theatre seats, and in this day and age when crime and violence is seen as passe those feelings are vitally important."

","We Were Soldiers, as you'd expect from the title, is a war film told from the American soldier's point of view.<br/><br/>It's 1965 and the U.S. army has escalated their commitment to the Vietnam War. <br/><br/>North Vietnamese Regular Army personnel at Ia Drang in the central Highlands of Vietnam had attacked American troops and then retreated. Chasing them, The American Seventh Cavalry fly into battle, and into an ambush, on their new steeds, the helicopter.<br/><br/>Colonel Custer led a battalion of the same name, the First Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry, into a similarly risky battle many years before. Will this fight 10,000 miles from mainland America turn into another massacre?<br/><br/>We Were Soldiers follows to large extent actual events of the time. This battle became the first major land battle between the Americans and the Vietnamese of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>The battalion was led by Lt. Col Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) who is now a sprightly eighty something year old. (He obviously survived!)<br/><br/>Moore was a veteran of the Korean conflict and according to his biography, upon which the film is based, a student of the history of warfare.<br/><br/>
He knew how effective the Vietnamese had been against the French only a few years before. And this was the first use like this of the helicopter in warfare.<br/><br/>There's a long lead up to the battle, establishing the American troops as being parents and lovers to their wives. There's a good deal of knee bending. Moore was (is) Catholic. <br/><br/>Then we're into battle with a bang, thousands of them. The firefight is intense and lasted unabated for days. We cut periodically back to the U.S. where we see the wives receiving telegrams informing them of the death of their husbands.<br/><br/>The Vietnamese appear to be well drilled, heroic and surprisingly, neatly outfitted, and we're given some insights into the concerns of their officers as they try to cope with this new enemy. <br/><br/>The Vietnamese were veterans. The Americans were only the latest invaders of their country. The locals had already seen off the Chinese and the French in the previous decades.<br/><br/>Some attempt made to personalize the Vietnamese, even if not much effort was made to get appropriate extras. Not too many 1960's Vietnamese would have carried nearly as much body fat. I'm pretty sure I even spotted a black skinned, Negroid Vietnamese!<br/><br/>And what of Mel Gibson as Lt. Col Hal Moore? Apart from being far too old, today's Hal Moore would be well over 100 years old if Mel was the right age, Gibson's facial ticks, ideal for crazy cops a decade ago, tend to be just annoying in We Were Soldiers.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot as his offsider gets all the good lines. The photographer depicted in the movie wrote the book the film is based on with Hal Moore.<br/><br/>But We Were Soldiers isn't riveting cinema. It's relentless, but those who really like war movies because of the violence will only enjoy it. Mel does Mel well. Has he ever done anything else? <br/><br/>And those of you who might think that the final `victory', the rush up the hill, in the battle looked a bit strange will be reassured by the fact that reportedly it didn't happen.<br/><br/>The Vietnamese in fact moved deeper into their tunnel complex because of devastating air bombardment, principally from B52 bombers. Not because of the no doubt heroic efforts of the Americans on the ground.<br/><br/>The Vietnamese were heavily mauled in this battle. <br/><br/>They retreated and regrouped to fight another day. The Americans were always outnumbered and less motivated on Vietnamese home soil.<br/><br/>
A pattern was then set that continued until the Americans finally retreated in disarray from the country on April 30 1975. 2 Bloody Flys Out Of Five"

","We Were Soldiers tells the account of the first engagement between American and Vietnamese troops in 1965.<br/><br/>Rather than go into the hows and whys about the conflict, the film concentrates on the massacre of the men on both sides during the three day engagement.  In fact, the reasons of the war itself are barely brought up bar a scene where Mel Gibson's daughter asks him what war is.  'Well' he replies 'it's when some people try to take the lives of other people and it's my job to stop them' is the only jot of reason offered here.<br/><br/>As a non American it is hard for me to comfortably speak my viewpoints on this.  After all, I have never encountered war and hopefully never will.  I know only too well from the countless Vietnam films made, that many people considered America's involvement as intrusive and unnecessary and the returning soldiers were treated thanklessly.  This film does concentrate on that aspect and relays the accounts of the action from the viewpoint that the men did not fight for their country but for each other.  A similar sentiment that was strongly portrayed in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>As a film, there are many good and bad points.  It is certainly well made. The direction is faultless with some intense, dramatic and downright horrific scenes.  The sound is also excellent making brilliant use of the surround sound in the theatre.  What lets the film down however is a terrible script and even worse, acting from some of the cast, even Mel himself in certain scenes.  As for Sam Elliot himself, well, he should not have been in this film in my opinion.  He offered nothing and was in no way believable as a Sergeant.  Ridiculous stuff.  The use of Scottish music during some really poignant scenes was also very questionable.<br/><br/>Overall, this could have been a classic war film but perhaps after so many Vietnam films and ones that have been much better, this is really no more than an entertaining distraction for a couple of hours and offers no insight behind the first conflict in a long and terrible war.<br/><br/>7/10."

","""We Were Soldiers""  Rating: 7.5/10<br/><br/>I almost did not see this film due to the negative reviews it received in the UK.  I then recognized the public's approval and decided to give it a try.  I do not agree with severity of the negative comments about this film and consequently endeavor to communicate another perspective.<br/><br/>A number of areas in this film are kept simple.  The depiction of Colonel Moore's home life has hints of Frank Capra: the ideal relationship with an unquestioning wife, the family praying together before bed.  There are also simplistic representations of Colonel Moore's relationships with his troops. An example of this is the lack of development of Moore's friendship with Sgt. Maj. Basil L. Plumley (Sam Elliot).  This can be interpreted as poor film making.  I do not think this is a failure of director Randall Wallace to address the negative aspects of family life or the complexity of relationships.  Instead, there is a focus on the ideal and on simple messages.  A message of great depth is not more powerful that a simple message, it is just delivered differently.  As with all things in life, sport, business and relationships the basics are what drive positive results.  This film delivers basic messages that anyone can appreciate: importance of a strong family life, belief in God for personal strength, the importance of leaders not living in ivory towers, there are no winners in war, and so on.<br/><br/>Although I entered the theater with an open mind, it was difficult not to compare ""We Were Soldiers"" with the likes of ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Thin Red Line"".  During the film I thought to myself, where are the cowards, the self-seeking senior officers and the dissident rankers (as Philip French writes) as depicted in the ""The Thin Red Line""? These characters were in the film but not developed, such as the General who demanded Moore abandon his troops and the battle coordinators in Saigon who did not want a ""massacre"" to become public knowledge.  Some critics identify this lack of development as a shortcoming of the film.  I cannot personally vouch of the character of Hal Moore, but based on his accomplishments, commitment to his men, and strength as a leader I would believe that he selected and attracted the best troops.  I would propose that because of the overwhelming number of courageous and dedicated troops in the battle of la Drang that footage dedicated to these other characters would mislead viewers' perception of the type of men who died in the battle.  Would the battle have been won under such difficult odds if these men were not exceptional?  We should not be so cynical such that belief in an event is derived from knowing that it has an unsavory element.  I decided not to compare, but instead keep my mind open and enjoy the remainder the film.<br/><br/>I do not rate ""We Were Soldiers"" as highly as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Thin Red Line"" but it is worth seeing on it's own merits."

","I read the original book a few years ago and looked forward to the movie treatment. I found the battle scenes technically outstanding, and full of tension and drama. However, some of the personal developments were lacking. I also was severely disappointed to see the Welsh Lt Rick Rescorla completely excised from the film, something that did not help overseas interest in the film. Lt Rescorla was a former British Army Paratrooper who fled his native Britain to be a mercenary in Africa, and later escaped to the United States. Besides SGM Plumley & LTC Moore, he was one of the few officers with combat experience. He was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in the battle, and was later killed on Sept 11th, 2001 in the World Trade Center attack.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it's good, but not great. During the combat scenes, Mel Gibson completely changes, becoming a commanding presence who is completely believable. However, I was disappointed in Galloway's portrayal. I think he could have been an excellent counterpoint to the gung-ho Moore, & Galloway's big scene was a ridiculous montage that was completely out of place in the movie. I was also pleased to see that the true origins of the Vietnam War, rampant European colonialism, was presented.<br/><br/>I find this is best looked at as a prequel to ""Platoon."" In ""Platoon"" Sgt Elias (Willem Dafoe) wears a combat patch of the 1st Cavalry Division, making him a possible veteran of the Ia Drang. During a conversation with Pvt Taylor (Charlie Sheen) character, Elias says that America is going to lose this war, and Taylor is shocked and told him that that isn't possible. Sgt Elias responds with something like:<br/><br/>""Yeah, back in '65 I believed that.""<br/><br/>That's the problem, the people who have criticized this film as a whitewash don't know history. This was 1965, before years of Pentagon lies & bodybags soured America on the war, before the highly trained and motivated young recruits were replaced with sullen, unmotivated draftees.<br/><br/>Mixed feelings, but worth a look."

I hate to sound sexist, but it would be wise gentlemen to see without your significant other, wife, girlfriend, etc. We Were Soldiers portrays the carnage, destruction, and brutally very well. It is every bit the classic that Platoon was. It is probably more gory and gruesome than even Saving Private Ryan. It portays the North Vietnamese Regulars and the Americans as both brave, capable and hard fighters in a very respectfully way.Nobody was made out to be a hero, just brave men fighting a desperate battle. The most telling scene in the  whole movie is when General Westmoreland wanted Col. Moore to leave the battle to give him a briefing.That scene  shows the brain trust of Westmoreland, LBJ, Macnamara, the Joint Chiefs and the others were hopelessly out of touch and derelict in their duties to not only these men, other servicemen and most of all the country.

I must concede that Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson must have thrown it into this movie as a reminder that it is ""from the people who brought you BRAVEHEART"".

(The same criticisms were made about THE GREEN BERETS, also set in the Central Highlands on the Cambodian border.) That assumption is a frightening indication of how the mindset of previous batch of Vietnam movies has superseded reality. Not only do Moore and Galloway devote most of Chapter 4 to describing the terrain, Moore himself scouted around several Army posts nationwide and personally selected the area at Fort Hunter Liggett where the battle scenes were filmed.<br/><br/>There was another comment about how the final bayonet charge supposedly never happened and was invented. Please reference Chapter 16 (pages 249-253 of the tie-in edition); okay, so the close air support was provided by fixed-wing aircraft rather than by the Hueys of Snake Crandall and Too Tall Freeman. Dramatic license, perhaps. But Moore himself WAS there where the fighting took place, and you can't say that it was invented or that it never happened.<br/><br/>Because of the limitations of the medium of film, dramatic license, time compression and composite characterization are unavoidable in even the very best efforts at adapting a movie from true historical events. (GETTYSBURG and BLACK HAWK DOWN are the other two war films made within the past decade that have succeeded in doing so, and WE WERE SOLDIERS is up there with them.)

"bmwboy","3","0","2","16 March 2002"," Just Another War Movie
","Lots of movies have been made concerning the Vietnam War, most of them in recent memory were excellent (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Good Morning Vietnam).  All had their own little unique perspectives on the events during the war.  ""We Were Soldiers"" however, is just another war movie, and not a very good one.  The plot is slow very slow and predictable,  the acting is so-so, and character development is terrible.  As a member of the viewing audience, you feel no connection to the characters, therefore it's hard to conjure up any kind of emotions during the scenes which try to pry any emotions out of you.  Even the extra actors portraying Viet Cong soldiers didn't do a good job of playing dead.  I am serious...I could swear one of them was trying to hold back laughter while trying to play dead.<br/><br/>But the hardest thing which I could not overcome while watching the movie, is the scenery.  Even though I have never been to Vietnam, some of the better movies made about the war made me feel as though I have been there. They all followed a basic formula for the scenery, some, even shot on location in Vietnam.  Now I have no idea where the war scenes were shot for ""We Were Soldiers"", but I could swear that they were shot in the mountains outside of Los Angeles, CA.  Since when were there oak trees in Vietnam? The war scenes looked like a bunch of guys from Los Angeles who drove to the Angeles Crest forest, got out of their BMW's, did a reenactment of a battle that occurred in Vietnam, then went home.  <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just plain boring and uninspirational.  It tries to use the premise of remembering those who died in a bloody battle in order to make a movie and a few extra bucks.  Well, I donated my $8.50 to watch this movie and I wish I had it back.  I wouldn't even recommend this movie as a rental.  In a year, this movie will wind up in the discount VHS bin at Wal-Mart."
"wildcatt268","Null","0","1","15 March 2002"," An honest portrayal. No politics, just war
","I am amazed at the misdirected and uninformed criticisms contained in some of the reviews.  While most reviews are rightfully favorable, some seem to view this movie as just some jingoistic portrayal of American history, rather than accepting that this is a ""real story"" told by the ""real commander"" of the US forces involved.  It is not totally faithful to the extraordinary book by Hal Moore, ""We Were Soldiers Once--and Young"", but a great attempt was made, with a great result.  The battle portrayed certainly occurred at a time (1965) when the War in Vietnam was not yet in disfavor with the nation.  To put it in a social context, Barry Sadler's ""Ballad of the Green Berets"" was a number one song that year in the US.  The national ""guilt trip"" had not yet set in (to continue for the next 25 years). The particular political context in which to put our involvement in Vietnam  at that time was as a continuation of our foreign policy of ""containment"" (of communism).  That was it. While the validity of that concept may be argued, that policy is why we fielded troops in Vietnam. Those troops of the 1st Cav or any other unit had no vote in the matter. They went and they did their duty. The 1st Cav was among the first large units to arrive after the advisors, and this was the first big, set-piece battle.  Moore was an excellent commander, with excellent subordinates and troops, and made the best out of a very tough situation.  The movie even paid due respect to a tough, dedicated opponent--the North Vietnamese Army.  Gibson, Elliot and Kinnear, in particular, turned in fine performances.  Unfavorable comparisons of this movie to ""Platoon"" are without basis, as that movie was based on a work of pure fiction. ""Platoon"" was plagued by Oliver Stone's own political angst and bitter orientation (evidently) regarding his own service in the infantry in Vietnam, and distorted the image of US infantrymen in Vietnam, portraying them primarily as either murderers, druggies or both (if you doubt that, read Robert Hemphill's, ""Platoon, Bravo Company"", which tells the real story of the unit Stone served in and allegedly portrayed in ""Platoon"").  ""We Were Soldiers"" contained scenes that were brutal, shocking, and violent--welcome to real combat.  I served in Vietnam as an infantryman, and I swear that this movie was head and shoulders above ""Platoon"", ""Full-Metal Jacket"" or ""Appocalypse Now"" in its portrayal of American infantry combat in that war."

","(A different perspective is needed for the non-Americans reading here.)<br/><br/>I am bewildered by anyone claiming this film is ""moving"" in any form whatsoever.  It is plainly just another Saving Private Ryan clone, using a true story and occasional shots of families back home to detract from the fact that 75 per cent of what we see is simple gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I loved Saving... and thoroughly enjoyed the gritty battle scenes depicted here.  I just take offence to the fact that this movie - and it appears many of its viewers - believe there is something deeper just because of an over-long opening half-hour and sporadic moments of gorping realisation from Gibson.  The brief sub-plot of the enemy trooper went almost unnoticed and was a feeble attempt to portray both sides 'equally'.    <br/><br/>The battle scenes themselves were not immune from fault.  Some of the extras were going down like they'd just been tugged by a bungee rope, and 'invincible' Gibson managed to waltz around, head held high, like he owned the place for the entire three days without getting a scratch.  True story huh?  It reminded me of an old-fashioned war-movie at times, when you knew as soon as a soldier mentioned their home/wife/kids (delete as appropriate) they were going to be capped within the next five minutes. <br/><br/>
Some moments are incredibly cheesy and I found the typical Yankee-doodle-dah predictable and tiresome.  I would have had more respect for the film if it had kept to Gibson's character's claim that they were fighting for each other, not the country; yet what do we see at the end - the defeated enemy officer finding a 'stars n stripes' on the victorious battle field, the losers lying dead behind him.<br/><br/>I was going to comment that Hollywood's blind patriotism must be boring even Americans by now, but looking at the views on this board it appears I am mistaken.  It was obvious this film was going to be a success after the September tragedy, but I just hope it doesn't help to stoke the fires of the 'war is good/revenge = justice' attitude President Bush seems to be emitting in the current state of affairs.<br/><br/>Engrossing battle scenes, but the rest of the film tries to pretend it's something it's not.  4/10"

","While We Were Soldiers is entertaining let us not try and place this movie among the best of its genre.

These movies try and deliver the audience into the horrors of warfare while maintaining the morality and honor of the soldier.  While most movie-goers would agree that this is a noble cause, movies exist for entertaining purposes, not as a soapbox.  We Were Soldiers delivers too much rhetoric of god and country while delivering very little in plot or character development.  Outside of mel gibson, very little is discussed of these men. All we are told is that they are god fearing, family loving, glad to die for their country, good old boys.  The writer and producer should have stepped back on the morality and stepped forward on the plot.  I do not argue with the message of the movie, just the way in which it is delivered.

"cautelasj","Null","0","1","11 March 2002"," An excellent film about a little known part of the Vietnam War... The beginning.
","We Were Soldiers is an important addition the body of films about the Vietnam War. One important distinction from its predecessors is that this film recognizes the presence of the French Colonials in Vietnam 10 years before the Americans ever arrived. (There was a scene of a French plantation that was cut from the film Apocalypse Now that is now available in the new Redux version on DVD.) Another thing that sets this movie apart is the fact that it deals with the very beginning of the war in 1965, while most other films deal with periods from 1967 to 1970 when the scope of the war had expanded. People expect Vietnam films to be about demoralized draftees who don't want to be there and escape from their hellish reality with drugs. This was certainly true later in the war, but not in 1965. Some other criticisms have been made about the film's dialogue being too flag-waving and jingoistic.  I don't believe that these allegations have a lot of merit because in November 1965 the soldiers coming to Vietnam were bright eyed and idealistic in many cases. The draft had not expanded yet and many of the soldiers were volunteers who were anxious to stop the perceived spread of communism. Lines like ""I'm glad I was able to die for my country"", could certainly have been uttered from the lips of a dying soldier at this early stage of the war. As a Sergeant in the Marine Corps I can certainly attest to the battle sequences harrowing realism. I do not believe these scenes glorify war or violence, but they give us a vivid picture of a literal hell on earth! All the performances by the actors are solid, (except for Chris Klein, who can't act himself out of a paper bag)! When this film was released I saw a daily poll on IMDB ask: What do you think the best movie about Vietnam is? I consider this a hard question to answer because the conflict lasted officially from 1964 to 1973. American involvement went through at least three distinct phases that lasted nine years! Any one film may capture 1 of the 3 phases well, but not the entire conflict! All considered, this film remains true to history and is a testament to the sacrifice and dedication of the American soldier. In any War."

After listening to Gibson go on and on about why we fight wars (to defend the innocent from the bad etc), I expected at least SOME attempt to establish why we were fighting that war, that battle. As it is, with no explanation and using Gibson's logic in the movie, I couldnt help think to myself that we were the invaders, the bad guys. I love a good war movie, but you cant leave loopholes like this in it. Im a conservative, but you cant just send troops to fight somewhere without a compelling reason, and this movie presents NO reason, let alone a compelling reason."
"panduh","7","0","2","11 March 2002"," A little too sappy/patriotic to be a great film.
","This is not a horrible film by any means.  There are a lot of gripping, visceral battle scenes, and the film does make an effort to try and show the Viet Cong as humans, although, it achieves this only towards the end, (towards the beginning, the VC are portrayed as the same ol' stereotypical Yellow Menace -- commander barking out stilted, harsh commands, et al).<br/><br/>The thing that makes the movie unsatisfactory for me is undue sappiness and an overly religious and patriotic tone.  Unlike ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Thin Red Line"", which both try and make attempts at showing the gritty, painful life and experience from the eyes of a soldier during a war without covering it with unnecessary sentimentality, ""We Were Soldiers"" has a more ""idealized"" view.  Even though the movie does an good job of displaying the futility of the Vietnam War, and shows some of the more graphic violence that accompanied it, the acting by the leads and much of the script has an ""over-the-top"" nationalism attached to it that made me squirm in my seat more than watching a artillery soldier getting burnt to a crisp by napalm. Scenes such as the ""prayer scene"" in the chapel that Gibson has with Chris Klein as they pray for Kleins new-born baby were relatively unnecessary, in my opinion. It only served to give an excuse for schmaltz later on in the film and pound us over the head with fact that Gibson's character is so great and kind-hearted and the ideal God-fearing soldier of the U-S-of-A. It was like a big, loud alarm for you to realize that ""Hey something is gonna happen to this kid that will make you sad and weepy. Take note!"" Also, Klein's character, who is supposed to be a tragic figure, for some reason did not feel tragic enough to me. I think the major reason is that Chris Klein simply is not the right actor for this part. He is completely unconvincing, and lets face it, he is not a very good actor. I am sad to say he resides in the same league as Keanu Reeves when it comes to acting skill. Barry Pepper would have been a much better choice in that role, seeing as how miniscule his actual part is and is pretty much wasted.<br/><br/>
Mel Gibson does an adequate job, but his style and mannerisms don't necessarily translate well into this type of roll.  He does the crazy little ""look over to the side"" move he perfected in Lethal Weapon, while he speaks. This is a bit disconcerting, and is not befitting behavior for a battle-hardened veteran.  His emotional display at the end of the movie is also fairly hard to believe.  On the other hand, when Gibson is actually on the battlefield commanding the battle, he is thoroughly convincing, and that is where he shines!  He is at once valiant, courageous, strategic and compassionate.  The battle scenes display Mel's true talents as an actor. The non-battle segments of the film are better left forgotten. (For example, the above mentioned chapel scene, and the scene where Mel has to explain to his baby daughter what a war is made me cringe).<br/><br/>Finally, I just wanted to add that I had a helluva time trying to understand what Sam Elliot was saying throughout the movie.  His drawl was so thick, that it sounded like he made the film with a mouthful of marbles.  It would have served the film well to provide subtitles just for Elliot's lines. Even though his role as the tough-as-nails drill sergeant was a tad stereotypical, he played it about as well as anybody could short of Clint Eastwood.  I just wish the director had tried to get more intelligible takes of his scenes!  I'd also like to give a big thumbs up once again to Barry Pepper, for his great, albeit small, performance in this film as a military reporter caught on the battlefield.  But the little overlay ""montage"" scene where he is taking various photos on the field was way cheesy and completely out of place. That was a real sore-spot for me.  I can't state enough how much that montage completely stunk, and is a clear sign of bad direction."

","Randall Wallace should stay away from Hollywood. Having written the not-too-bad screenplay for Gibson's ""Braveheart"", he felt the need to assault our senses of good taste by giving us ""The Man In The Iron Mask"", the script for ""Pearl Harbor"" and now, this piece of unmemorable if time-passing, overly-stylised pap. The opening half-hour is appallingly mishandled, with Gibson looking uncomfortable and saggy, and the dialogue becoming increasingly corny. Shephard growls his way into Vietnam, and the 'training camp' looks, literally, like a walk in the park compared to Joel Schumacher's gritty ""Tigerland"". Once we enter the war, things do pick up, mainly because there is hardly any dialogue, and that which we do hear is thankfully drowned out by the fantastic sound effects. A hearty attempt is made at showing some sort of Vietnamese perspective, but we still have a long way to go before we can safely say that we are being un-biased in our depiction of war in cinema. There are some cringeworthy moments in terms of the direction (including two appalling montage-attempts that look like commercial spoofs), but these are countered by some stunning visuals, notably the silhouetted Vietnamese soldiers closing in on two Yankee heroes. A special mention must go to the lack of anything new happening in the performances. Gibson gives perhaps his worst judged performance of his career, Shephard is an entertaining cliche, Kinnear does his smarmy thing and Pepper does not attempt to break any new ground either. Stowe, however, does her best with a poor role, lending it dignity and passion when it doesn't really deserve it. It seems as if ""based on a true story"" is now an excuse to go overboard on overly-patriotic, melodramatic glorified history, and ""We Were Soldiers"" proves to be another case of that very annoying Hollywood symptom (although the superior ""Black Hawk Down"" did not suffer as badly)"

We'd also seen it from the end, where the real struggle for many veterans was only beginning. <br/><br/>""Soldiers"" tells the beginning of the story, before the √Ç‚ÄòSecond Indochina War' became for Americans merely 'Vietnam.' The Nov. 14-16 Battle of Ia Drang Valley was the first major battle between American soldiers and North Vietnamese Army regulars (as opposed to the guerrilla Viet Cong). At this time there was still hope for some U.S. success, at least militarily (25,000 anti-war protesters would march on Washington mere weeks later). The film contains little talk about Communism, nor the American government's anti-Communist ""policy of containment"" in southeast Asia that got us into this war, but concentrates on the human side: you're called, you go, out of duty. <br/><br/>While this is the first worthwhile film of 2002, to say that this is ""the best war film ever"" (as one user put it) is a huge overstatement. I question a lot of Wallace's directing choices here, like the overuse of slow motion. It really got tiresome after a while. The narrative itself could have packed a bigger emotional punch had they cut it differently. This may have had a lot to do with Wallace's script and his apparent attachment to it. Upon seeing the footage, it would have been evident to me that he really had something with the home front scenes, the wives and widows, with Madeleine Stowe's (as Gen. Moore's wife) and Keri Russell's characters. I saw opportunities to weave those stories more with the battle scenes but Wallace--or someone else who pulls the strings--did not see it that way. Someone may have felt that audiences were looking for intense, sustained, bloody battle sequences, given the success of the standard-setting ""Saving Private Ryan"" and with the intense ""Black Hawk Down"" still in many theaters.<br/><br/>
It's still solid, though. Definitely worth seeing. Mel Gibson's work as Airmobile Division commander Lt. Colonel Hal Moore is solid, but the best reason to watch this is Sam Elliott's performance as Moore's second-in-command, Sgt. Major Basil Plumley. <br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","""We Were Soldiers"" is rather different from the majority of American Vietnam war films. Instead of the drug-taking, baby-killing, officer-fragging draftees that arrived later in the war, here we have the confident professional U.S. Army in its first major battle with North Vietnamese regulars in 1965. This is the famous slugfest in the Ia Drang Valley, recounted in the book the movie was based on, ""We Were Soldiers Once. . . and Young"". <br/><br/>Mel Gibson does a generically heroic job as the gung-ho Colonel Moore leading his 7th Air Cavalry battalion into this new ""valley of death"". Unlike the nonetheless fine ""Black Hawk Down"", this film does a better job with the individual personalities, the human element of the soldiers under terrible fire.<br/><br/>The combat scenes are first-rate as are the effects. Battles are realistic and bloody enough for anyone. The effects of napalm are depicted graphically on an American mistakenly hit by some. The final American fixed-bayonet charge reminded me of the famous charge by the 20th Maine regiment in the movie ""Gettysburg"" - although they did not have massive air support. American air power was the reason the Vietnamese were stopped, and, eventually, it hardly seemed fair.<br/><br/>The wives of the fighters are shown at length as oak-like pillars of strength, even despite the Army's callousness in delivering death notices by telegrams via yellow cab drivers. Entirely distracting, however, was Madeleine Stowe - a formerly gorgeous lady who now has surpassed even Melanie Griffith for the worst collagen lip-job in Hollywood. Stowe's puffed-up lips made her almost unrecognizable, and clown-like. Too bad.<br/><br/>Especially good in this movie was the sensitive way politics and the Vietnamese were handled. Lyndon Johnson's dark, deceitful shadow hangs over all these needless deaths; in fact, if the movie has a fault it does not adequately show how good men were foolishly used by Johnson and the Pentagon. The Vietnamese Army was depicted as heroic and as human beings; the final comments at the end of the movie by their colonel about how the battle would change nothing in the long run except the number of casualties was thoroughly appropriate.  <br/><br/>I recommend people also see/rent ""Go Tell the Spartans"" with Burt Lancaster. It was a fine and somewhat neglected film of this same period. ""Go tell the Spartans we die here obedient to their word"" was the last message sent by King Leonidas at Thermopolae against the Persians. And is ironic in the Vietnam context.<br/><br/>For those interested in historical anomalies, Gibson as Col Moore was spotted early in the movie carrying the book ""Great Battlefields of the World"", that in 1965. Unfortunately, it wasn't published until 1984.<br/><br/>A well-done war movie definitely worth seeing."
"daltonusmc","7","0","1","6 March 2002"," A powerfully moving epic, shrouded in honor
","The first few minutes of We Were Soldiers plays out like any war movie should. As did Saving Private Ryan (1998), Soldiers shows the atrocity in war early on yet unlike many other films, the key to bringing Soldiers to life is the fact that the atrocities of war do not fade and we as an audience are plunged into an era of horror as well as honor.<br/><br/>While Gibson's performance is not his best, it is the stunning cinematography and dialogue that makes the film a worthwhile one. Barry Pepper and Chris Klein have stirring performances and powerful dialogue. Although writer/director Randall Wallace does throw in quite a few cliches throughout the picture, it still comes across as a moving picture.<br/><br/>
War is hell. Yet We Were Soldiers shows that in entrenched in hellish situations, honorable deeds arise."
"jackjack-2","8","0","1","7 March 2002"," A Good Piece of Historical Fiction
","When the producers state in their advertising that a movie is based on a true story, they are telling you that it is historical fiction. That is the case with this flick. It was NOT the first big battle in the Viet Nam war. There were bigger battles prior to this battle but the battle that the film is based on resulted in a change in the strategy of the Viet Nam War. Unfortunately the film fails to note the significance, which was that Gen. Westmoreland, lacking any common sense decided that the US would win the war by attrition. The only problem with his theory was that the US would have to kill 400,000 North Vietnamese every year.<br/><br/>For the sake of Hollywood the film attributes some of the actions to the wrong participants; events occur in the wrong order, and events are distorted. Any veteran of the War will criticize the movie because of its placing soldiers in the open when in fact there was no open space in the heavy jungle.<br/><br/>But all in all, it is a picture well worth seeing. It shows soldiers in the positive aspects, if there is anything positive about war, instead of deliberate distortions as has all to often happened in Viet Nam war movies (such as Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter). This film is the best film ever made on the Viet Nam War and viewers will better understand how the war was fought and how tough it was. For those who have been in combat no movie can even get close to what it is like on the battle field, but this movie does as good a job as any. Mel Gibson does an excellent job of portraying the battalion commander."
"Orion_1","9","0","1","4 March 2002"," Gripping war-drama
","This movie is not like Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan. It has a more human aspect where you follow the war both on the battlefield and in the homes of their families. Mel Gibson makes a role he is very good at by now (remember Braveheart and The Patriot), playing a dedicated colonel who cares about his men. The difference compared to the other two movies is that emotions an the personality of the character is more prominent.<br/><br/>Also very good movie score by Glennie-Smith."
"mcmdvii","Null","0","1","4 March 2002"," Superb!!!!!!!!!!!
","If you liked Black Hawk Down, you'll love We Were Soldiers. Not only does this movie allow the audience to feel the intensity of battle against a formidable opponent (as well as witness the bloody and terrifying fact of war), it also immerses you deep in the hearts and minds of the soldiers who fought in the battle, as well as the families left at home. Furthermore, the audience is witness to the intense emotional and professional struggle of an excellent officer (Lt Col Moore played by Mel Gibson) who knows he must lead his men into combat, knowing many will not come out alive. The movie also has its lighter moments, with many of the humorous comments of Sergeant Major Basil Plumley (Sam Elliot). However, don't let the Sergeant Major's humor mislead you. He is a man well respected by both the enlisted men under him as well as the officers above him.<br/><br/>For a real insight into war, and the heart-wrenching emotions that accompany it, this is a movie to be seen!"
"fred-287","Null","0","1","4 March 2002"," Ten years too late? (Spoilers--of your dinner!)
","By now there's quite a body of film work about Vietnam.  It's hard for a new one to avoid the ""Been there before"" pitfall.  Also hard to avoid the political entanglement, although this one tries hard & nearly succeeds. To its great credit it begins with the French getting their butts kicked in the 1950s, we should remember this was not originally our war, we inherited it & strolled in there understanding basically nothing of the local situation, how Ho Chi Minh was a Nationalist more than a Communist & had lived in Brooklyn once & knew a lot about Americans. The first American soldier killed in then-Indochina was in 1945 (his attackers blew up his jeep, thinking he was French) & our involvement pre-dated Eisenhower & Kennedy, let alone LBJ whom we see on the black-&-white TV.  Mel Gibson's Colonel Moore is a wonderful character, a student of military & other history & a throwback to the era when officers actually were in front of their troops rather than far behind.  I haven't read the book but I imagine much of the character is from the real-life Moore, whom I saw on CNN recently & liked immediately.  The combination of religious fervor & military bloodlust with a dollop of wry humor is very real, I saw a lot of that in the army myself--these guys were scary & funny at the same time.  And they know when their superiors are being idiots yet they do what they're told the best they can, believing they have to answer to a Higher Authority if they shirk their duty.  I was glad that the battle scenes had a somewhat chaotic quality, a ""Now what the hell do we do?"" aspect.  The best scenes were of the stranded platoon, guys thrown together in deep doodoo realizing they were just gonna have to come up with a way to survive, again I was reminded of guys I'd known in the army, maybe not the smartest or noblest guys in the world but made of some pretty stern stuff.   And there were certain scenes--here comes the SPOILER part--that people just need to see, like the guy who gets a white-phosphorus grenade (""Willie P,"" we called that stuff) burning under his skin so the medic has to try to cut part of his face off with a bayonet, or the guy with half his face burned off by napalm & when someone takes hold of his legs to try to carry him, the fried skin slides right off.  This has special resonance in the wake of the September 11 horrorshow, remember those burn victims?  Or when the helicopter gunship cuts loose---yeah, people get turned into Swiss cheese, that's kinda the point.  (The military really only has 2 functions: to kill people & break things.)   That's how it is people. We send our young men off to do these horrible things for us, the least we can do is look at it occasionally.  Now cinematically, sure the flick has its flaws, e.g. that whole extended telegram sequence was flat & ungainly & had nothing like the unbearable tension of just one telegram scene in ""A League of Their Own,""  & the racial element seemed forced, the young black wife seemed an anachronism with her modern-day ""Word-up"" 'tude.  The Galloway character added nothing in particular, although we know he was there & Barry Pepper's performance is fine, could've been saltier though. But I hope this flick finds an audience, especially currently, as our body count in Afghanistan mounts, we need to remind ourselves war's not just a sound-bite on TV, it's very real & very nasty & death is very permanent & especially when I hear talk like ""Let's go take out Saddam Hussein, it'll be a cakewalk,"" all I can do is groan--well, that's another topic.   But bottom line, see the movie--it tells the truth."
